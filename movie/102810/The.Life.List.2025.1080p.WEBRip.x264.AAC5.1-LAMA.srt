00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,750
- How's this?
-  Cool.

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,750
Sexy. I like it.

9
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,500
I think I'm going to change.

10
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,333
Stop eating the salad.

11
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,291
Come in.

12
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,374
I wanted to let you know
people are starting to arrive.

13
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,165
Great. Is Alex here yet?

14
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,540
Uh, no. But she is gonna be bringing
her bean salad.

15
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,040
Ah. Alex is on Alex time...

16
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,790
...and there's
never a good time for that bean salad.

17
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,582
But you know what?
Let's... Let's give her a break today.

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,540
Mom, you are always making excuses
for her. You realize that, right?

19
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,040
It's 'cause she's my favorite child.

20
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,082
- Okay, the truth finally comes out.
-  Oh!

21
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,165
- Ouch!
- I'm still your favorite son, right?

22
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,625
Oh, sure.

23
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,707
"Why aren't you married yet?"

24
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,749
"Why do you work in a record store?"

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,540
"Why'd you give up teaching?"

26
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,124
"Why didn't you finish college?"

27
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,332
Why didn't you finish college?

28
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,332
I'm a life guy.
I learn by living, you know?

29
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,957
You love that about me.

30
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,499
Right, right.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,458
Right.

32
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,332
Hey, how about this?

33
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,082
What about we go in there,
we say our hellos,

34
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,249
and then you give me the high sign,
we sneak off to your childhood bedroom

35
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,332
and make out
surrounded by the Barbies and Kens.

36
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,957
Mm, you're not getting anywhere
near my Barbies, buster.

37
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:08,999
Hmm.

38
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,207
- I'm going to take this into the kitchen.
- Okay.

39
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,040
-  Hey, Lucas. Hey, Zoe.
- Hey!

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,249
Happy baby shower.

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,832
- There it is. Looks good.
- Yeah. Famous bean salad.

42
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,750
Yeah.

43
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,540
Super good.

44
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,665
Auntie Allie!

45
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,291
Hi, guys.

46
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,457
This party is so boring, and Dad
won't let us have cake until later.

47
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,541
What is it with parents, huh?

48
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,332
How about one of
our famous scavenger hunts?

49
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:47,624
Okay, I want six items that I could find
in Harry or Hermione's room.

50
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,832
And bonus points for anything that can
be used to make boring adults disappear.

51
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,041
Got it?

52
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,582
Oh, one second.

53
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,458
You guys need proper nutritional
preparation before we commence.

54
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,749
Okay.

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,250
- Zoe, I want you to meet Julia.
- Hi.

56
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,124
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

57
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,540
Alex! Hi!

58
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,290
Oh, Kelly, wow. Oh my God, look at you.

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,749
No, don't. I'm so big.

60
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,624
But so beautiful.

61
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,290
Aw, why, thank you.

62
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,290
I heard you had to give up teaching.

63
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,457
- And you're working for your mother now?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,749
And your boyfriend
has a job at a record store?

65
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,915
I didn't know
there were record stores anymore.

66
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,665
Uh-huh. There's one left.

67
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,499
The rest of the time,
he's developing a video game called

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,749
either <i>American Zombie: Blood Apocalypse</i>
or <i>Playground Armageddon.</i>

69
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,749
And one day,
you'll make your mommy buy it for you.

70
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,249
Yes, you will. Yes, you will!

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,415
I've got to go grab Alex for a second.

72
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,040
Elizabeth, I am dying for you
to meet my friend Katie.

73
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,125
She's a huge fan of Rose Cosmetics.
Come meet her. Two seconds, two seconds.

74
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,165
Oh my God.
Thank God you're here.

75
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,207
I thought I was the only woman
under 40 not pregnant or lactating.

76
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,207
Hi. How are you?

77
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,499
Insufferable bitches.
I hate them all.

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,374
Yeah. They're just jealous
because they don't get out anymore.

79
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,082
Yeah.
Except you don't go out anymore either.

80
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,958
Or even call your friends back.

81
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,040
What is going on with you?

82
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,082
Anybody want a gummy?

83
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,290
Yes. Can I have the, uh...

84
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,999
- They're five milligrams...
- Awesome.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,374
- Times four. You should be good to go.
-  Excellent.

86
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,165
-  See you in five hours.
-  You're not driving home, right?

87
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,082
- Then you're fine.
-  Where's Elliot?

88
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,290
-  We broke up.
- Sorry.

89
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,082
- I gotta go.
-  Yeah. No, it's fine.

90
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,374
I've already gone on two--

91
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,040
Did you give the kids cake?

92
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,041
Uh...

93
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,166
Oh yeah.

94
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh yeah.

95
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,082
-  That was me.
-  Definitely.

96
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,540
Julian, relax. I mean, right?
Like, all we're saying is...

97
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,415
- Let them eat cake.
- Lots of it.

98
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,915
What could possibly go wrong?

99
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,790
Let's go to Auntie Alex's room.
Maybe she has a fountain pen.

100
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,458
-  Slow down!
-  Hurry up already!

101
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,790

105

Finn, you have a really big willy.

106
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,250
Thank you.

107
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,415
- Am I grounded?
- Forever.

108
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,500
- I don't think Julian'll ever forgive you.
- Is that a promise?

109
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
- Hi.
-  Hi.

110
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,290
Mmm.

111
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,458
Hmm.

112
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,958
Seriously, though.
What is going on with you?

113
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,458
- What do you mean?
- Um...

114
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,125
I don't know. I feel like
maybe you're floundering a little bit.

115
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,040
Feeling a little lost.

116
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,083
Lost?

117
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,790
I have a new boyfriend and a great job.

118
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,999
Working for your mother?

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,040
Selling makeup to women twice your age?
What a dream.

120
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,833
Yeah, but it's a job.

121
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:21,582
With a future and security, and a job
I thought I was getting pretty good at.

122
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,375
Yeah, you're good at it.

123
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,957
It's not who you are.

124
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,040
It's not what you're passionate about.

125
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,415
- Passion is overrated.
- What?

126
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:34,375
It is. It never lasts,
and it's completely exhausting.

127
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,250
Besides, isn't that
what my generation is all about?

128
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,499
Lowering expectations
and letting go of childish dreams?

129
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,457
Alex, you do not believe that.

130
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,208
Besides, I love working for you, Mom.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I do.

132
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,125
You built this incredible business
all by yourself, and...

133
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,916
and I want to be a part of it.

134
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,416
And make you proud.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,624
Well, since you put it that way.

136
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,499
- Mom.
- Hmm?

137
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,875
I have some news.

138
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:13,875
Oh?

139
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,915
Finn officially asked me to move in.

140
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,832
Oh.

141
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,708
Well, at least until I find a new place.
In the meantime, we both save on rent.

142
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,915
How romantic.

143
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,915
Why do you guys all hate him?

144
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,915
Is it because he didn't finish college?

145
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,332
Neither did Steve Jobs.

146
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,249
I do not hate Finn.

147
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,415
I think he is a very sweet boy

148
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,665
who loves video games

149
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,540
and apparently has a large--

150
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,207
Oh my God, Mom. You have to stop.

151
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,957
Okay, I'll stop.

152
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:45,957
For now.

153
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:46,999
Thank you.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,333
You're welcome.

155
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,500
I have news too.

156
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,750
It's back.

157
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,250
Yeah.

158
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,625
Okay.

159
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,875
Okay, so they'll just
have to get rid of it again.

160
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,625
No.

161
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,624
We'll find another doctor, and...

162
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,999
And I read about these treatments
they're doing in Germany

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,874
that apparently are really effective.

164
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,082
And I will stop working...

165
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,082
- Alex.
- And move in.

166
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,707
And I will take care of you
until you get better.

167
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,791
No.

168
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,499
No magic treatments in Germany.

169
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,083
No cure that's ten times worse
than the disease.

170
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,624
It's not going to make a difference.

171
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,916
Not this time.

172
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,375
Come here.

173
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,374
What am I going to do with you?

174
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,291
What am I going to do without you?

175
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,041
Hey, sweetie.

176
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,875
Ready to make an appearance?

177
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,166
Gonna be okay?

178
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,125
- Hi, Sam.
- It's good to see you. Really is.

179
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,374
-  Don't you think it's surreal?
-  How do you mean?

180
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,000
All of these people here except
the one person who's supposed to be.

181
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,958
I keep expecting her to walk out of
the kitchen and tell me to stop slouching.

182
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,083
I didn't know Dad was gonna be here.

183
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,582
They were married for 20 years,
most of them, happy.

184
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,707
- Of course he was gonna be there.
- Whatever.

185
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,082
I just hate when he talks as if

186
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,874
the divorce was
some kind of mutual decision.

187
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,915
Like, bro, he left her.

188
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,249
I hope your mom was clear
about dividing stuff up.

189
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,207
You don't wanna be like the Nelsons.
They don't talk to each other anymore.

190
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,999
Agreed. As long as I get
the Tamayo painting in the front hall.

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,582
God, Mom's barely been gone a week,
and all you can talk about is her stuff?

192
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,874
That's easy for you to say.
You're inheriting the company.

193
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,874
You don't know that.
I've barely worked a year.

194
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,332
Why do you think
Catherine spent so much time training you?

195
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,082
God, you make me sound like a pet.

196
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,624
Stop it, both of you.

197
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,374
Alex is doing great at work.

198
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,791
She's entirely ready for what's ahead.

199
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,415
Hello, everyone. Apologies for being late.

200
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,415
I'd just like to say
how truly sorry I am for your loss.

201
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,290
Uh, who are you exactly?

202
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,457
My name is Brad Ackerman.

203
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,499
I worked with your mother
on the final draft of her will.

204
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,666
- Where's old man Sullivan?
- Mr. Sullivan is in his office.

205
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,749
Um, it's Brad, right?

206
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,874
I'm sorry,
but are you even a partner here?

207
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm an associate partner.

208
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,374
Maybe we should ask
to see his law degree.

209
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,791
You must be Alex.

210
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,582
And let me guess,

211
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,582
Julian, Catherine, Lucas, and Zoe.

212
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,957
Congratulations on
the birth of your daughter, Emma.

213
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,208
Thank you.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,625
Your mother was an amazing woman.

215
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Even when she was sick,
she was so strong and funny,

216
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,540
and, I don't know if this makes any sense,

217
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,583
present in everything
that she said and did.

218
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,958
I'm honored she chose me
to be the executor of her estate.

219
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,790
Shall we begin?

220
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,540
"I, Elizabeth Rose,

221
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:46,082
a resident of Brooklyn, New York,
and a citizen of the United States,

222
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,249
declare this to be my final will."

223
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,790
This is so weird.

224
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,499
"To Julian, I leave
my Loeb edition of Plato's works."

225
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,957
"A gentle reminder that he may not always
be the smartest person in the room."

226
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:06,207
"The Tamayo painting, an evocative
reminder of the heritage of our family,

227
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,790
I leave to Zoe."

228
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:12,040
"She can share it with Lucas,
as long as he never leaves her."

229
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,541
I would never.

230
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,332
Next is your mother's house.

231
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,040
"It is my wish that
neither the house nor its contents

232
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,499
be sold or leased for 12 months."

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,582
"My children may inhabit the home
during this time,

234
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,540
but for no longer
than 90 consecutive days."

235
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,957
Whoa, sorry to interrupt.

236
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,040
Did our mother explain
why she wanted us to keep the house?

237
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,249
I wish we could keep it forever.

238
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,040
The house is Mom. It's our history.

239
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,541
Yeah, that's sweet, Alex.
Do you know what the taxes are?

240
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,040
Brad, are you sure she understood
how expensive this will be?

241
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,166
In fact, she made provisions
to cover any costs.

242
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,665
Shall we move on to Rose Cosmetics?

243
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,415
"My children's shares
of Rose Cosmetics will stay at 20%."

244
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:58,249
"The remaining shares and title of CEO
will go to my daughter-in-law,

245
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,957
Catherine Williams Rose."

246
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,165
Wait, what?

247
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,540
Your mother's remaining shares

248
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,166
of Rose Cosmetics
will go to your sister-in-law,

249
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,875
Catherine.

250
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,833
Her last directive is that
Catherine appoint a new head of marketing.

251
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,958
But <i>I'm</i> head of marketing.

252
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,665
Not after today.

253
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,875
So I'm fired?

254
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,582
She's firing me from the grave? What...

255
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,583
Aren't there, like,
laws or something against that?

256
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,165
"Finally, my beloved daughter, Alexandra,

257
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,083
is to collect her inheritance
at a later date."

258
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,499
And there is an asterisk here which
I'm meant to explain to you privately.

259
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,458
<i>This is insane.</i>

260
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,665
I mean, how long have you actually
been doing wills and dying?

261
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,374
I've been doing estate planning
at the firm for three years now.

262
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,624
Three years. Wow.

263
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,415
You're basically
a regular Thurgood Marshall.

264
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,665
That's nice, thank you. I appreciate that.

265
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:01,415
- Please don't talk to me like that.
- Or what? You'll take away my inheritance?

266
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,749
I'd like you to consider that
your mother was a very intelligent woman

267
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,874
whose main concern is what's best for you.

268
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,457
- Right, as in firing me.
- Trust her.

269
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,915
- And disinheriting me.
- She did not disinherit you.

270
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,791
Her only daughter. And I get nothing.
Not even a piece of furniture!

271
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,374
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that this is about money

272
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,040
and jewelry and whatever.

273
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,332
But the thing is,

274
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,415
yesterday, the only thing
that I wanted was her bed.

275
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:31,082
That's it. I just wanted
her old rickety iron bed

276
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,791
so I could just lay in it and curl up...

277
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,666
and just pretend
that she was still with me.

278
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,750
I know how close you and your mother were.

279
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,875
She told me many times.

280
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,375
She just had
something else in mind for you.

281
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:58,958
What is this?

282
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,083
She wanted you to open it
when you were alone.

283
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,665
Do you have a DVD player?

284
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,458
Yeah. It's in the closet
next to the VCR and the butter churn.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,250
My boyfriend has an Xbox.

286
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,458
Yeah, that'll work.

287
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,624
Go home. See what's in the envelope.

288
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,957
Hopefully some of this
will start to make some sense.

289
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,166
My lawyer will be in touch.

290
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,750
I... I am your lawyer.

291
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,750
Finn?

292
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hello?

293
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,833
<i>Hey, Bean.</i>

294
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,582
<i>You must be so pissed off.</i>

295
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,790
It's not funny, Mom, and--

296
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,375
<i>It's not funny, I know.</i>

297
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>But I'm gonna explain, okay?</i>

298
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:14,165
<i>Last week, I was getting
my so-called affairs in order.</i>

299
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,332
<i>Oh my God, the crap
that we hold onto for no apparent reason.</i>

300
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:23,040
<i>But it was actually
this amazing life flashback. You know?</i>

301
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,790
<i>I mean, it was actually a</i> you <i>flashback.</i>

302
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,207
<i>I got to... Look at all this stuff I found.</i>

303
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:32,415
<i>Look, all your finger paintings,
report cards.</i>

304
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:37,291
<i>But in the middle of it all,
I found this piece of paper.</i>

305
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,416
<i>A life list.</i>

306
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,708
Your <i>life list.</i>

307
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,375
I love this list.

308
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:54,374
This list is such a reflection
of who you are.

309
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,999
Who I was. I was 13 when I wrote it.

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,790
And I know, obviously, you have changed.

311
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,624
Oh my God,
it's like she's listening to me.

312
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,458
And I think that's my concern,

313
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,916
is that I don't know
that you have replaced this with anything.

314
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,541
I wonder, have you given up
your dreams and your aspirations?

315
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,541
<i>Your goals?</i>

316
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,666
<i>And don't tell me Rose Cosmetics, because</i>

317
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,749
I feel like I gave you this cozy job

318
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,499
that allowed you to run away
from who you really are.

319
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,208
-  Thanks a lot.
- So okay, let's look at the list.

320
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,666
<i>"Help people and make a difference."</i>

321
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,833
"Be a great teacher."

322
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,500
Alex, you are a born teacher.

323
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,582
<i>Okay, "learn to drive, get a tattoo."
You can skip those, please, dear God.</i>

324
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,375
<i>My one request...</i>

325
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,875
<i>"Find true love."</i>

326
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,290
<i>Why do I have a horrible feeling
you've given up on that too?</i>

327
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,665
That's not fair.

328
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,208
I want you to know how incredible you are.

329
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,291
I want you to live your best life.

330
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,457
<i>You have to get yourself
out of this hole you're in.</i>

331
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,790
I'm not in a hole.

332
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,541
<i>I'm sorry, that's not up for discussion.</i>

333
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,875
I'm not gonna be around to dig you out,
but I can sure as hell leave you a shovel.

334
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,833
I want you to complete this list, Bean.

335
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,166
<i>Hold on.</i>

336
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,916
Mom, you can't just say that and...

337
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,332
<i>Okay. Every time
you check off something from the list,</i>

338
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,540
<i>Brad is going to give you
one of these DVDs,</i>

339
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,999
<i>which I am going to record.</i>

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,291
<i>And once the list is completely finished,
you will get this envelope.</i>

341
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,791
<i>But the clock is ticking.</i>

342
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,165
<i>The list has to be finished by New Year's.
Otherwise, no envelope.</i>

343
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,041
Oh my God, I can't believe this.

344
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,916
I'm not screwing around, Bean.

345
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,125
This is serious business.

346
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,500
This is your life.

347
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,208
And I love you.

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,458
See you on the next DVD.

349
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,874
This is crazy.

350
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,707
"Go all out in a mosh pit."

351
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,124
"Play one-on-one with a New York Knick."

352
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,540
"Do stand-up comedy."
Walk me through that.

353
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:34,624
Lucas and I once swore that we would do
open mic night at the Comedy Cellar.

354
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,499
And... and I still have the jokes I wrote.

355
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,832
- I gonna need to read those.
- "Make peace with Dad."

356
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,374
"Be a great teacher." You can do these.

357
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,874
- Mm-hmm.
- You should do these.

358
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,499
Why? So I can inherit some money?

359
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
- Yeah.
- No, it's just gross.

360
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,582
Besides, I swore that I would never
step foot into a classroom ever again.

361
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,499
Oh my God, who cares?
Temp for a couple of weeks.

362
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,332
Roll out one of those rickety TVs,
pop on <i>Land Before Time,</i> and then <i>voilà.</i>

363
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,374
Or maybe you enjoy teaching again.

364
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,040
Isn't that the idea here?

365
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,332
Not my idea.

366
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,124
Alex. I've known you for a long time.

367
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,250
You'd never enjoy running that company,
no matter what you tell yourself.

368
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,374
Love when you guys get real.

369
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,291
Hmm, "Find true love."

370
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,790
You love Finn, right?

371
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,375
He's so sweet, so fun.

372
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,707
Apparently has a ginormous willy.

373
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:23,749
There's been three new iPhones
since you've been together.

374
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,415
You should know by now
if you love the guy.

375
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:30,207
Yeah, but living together was just
supposed to be like a temporary thing,

376
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:34,540
and then Mom got sick, and it just seemed,
you know, easier not to find my own place.

377
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,832
Which is exactly what she meant.

378
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,624
You're not dealing with shit.

379
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,625
Like not telling Finn about the list?

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,540
Do you remember when Lucas and I broke up
before we got engaged?

381
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,707
The whole world remembers.
Didn't Anderson Cooper do a special?

382
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,916
Hilarious.

383
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,916
I asked your mom for advice,
and she told me about her true love test.

384
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,500
Remember that?

385
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,125
Vaguely.

386
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,291
There's four questions
you're supposed to ask yourself?

387
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,457
Or is that Passover?

388
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,333
Yes, four questions.

389
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,083
One, can you tell him
everything in your heart?

390
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,000
Two, is he kind?

391
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,875
Three, does he help you
become the best version of yourself?

392
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,665
Meaning?

393
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,625
Alex in full flight with Finn.

394
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Four, can you imagine him
as the father of your children?

395
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,165
Elizabeth said to ask myself
those questions,

396
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,833
and if Lucas passed, I was on my way.

397
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,833
This is totally crazy. I know.

398
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,416
But I trust your mom.

399
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,375
Besides, what have you got to lose?

400
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:58,875
<i>Is Finn kind?</i>

401
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,541
<i>Absolutely.</i>

402
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,541
<i>Does he help me
become the best version of myself?</i>

403
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,708
<i>Can I tell him everything in my heart?</i>

404
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,541
<i>I can barely tell myself.</i>

405
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,458
<i>Can I imagine him being
the father of our children?</i>

406
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,290
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,207
- Oh, hey, babe.
- Hi.

408
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,540
I'm just, uh...

409
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,999
...doing the stoner test of my game.

410
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,083
The what?

411
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,749
The stoner test?

412
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,707
Kids like to play video games stoned,

413
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,832
so you have to make sure
it's still easy enough while you're high,

414
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,957
but still super challenging
when you're not high.

415
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,333
Know what I mean?

416
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,665
I need to talk to you about something.

417
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:52,708
Like, now?

418
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,791
Yeah.

419
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,040
You know, as a life motivator,
this is kind of genius.

420
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,874
I think you should totally go for it.
I mean, it's your inheritance.

421
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:04,957
- Really?
- Yeah.

422
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,165
Think about how much freedom
it would give you. Both of us, actually.

423
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,540
I mean, I could finish
designing <i>American Zombie,</i>

424
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,540
you'd run the company instead of teaching.

425
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:13,582
What company?

426
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,624
The gaming company
I'm always talking about.

427
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,124
You'd be like the... the brander
or whatever, and we'd hang 24-7.

428
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,790
Wait, is that how you see me?

429
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,874
Working for you
at your non-existent gaming company?

430
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,957
No, it's our company.

431
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,499
Come on, it'd be fun
working together again.

432
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,874
Remember when
we used to have fun before your whole

433
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,082
death fixation?

434
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,540
Finn, my mother just died.

435
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:38,457
I know, but I think you should try
having fun again, because fun is so... so...

436
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,790
- So fun?
- Yeah.

437
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:43,874
Fun's fun. That's actually... See,
that's a great slogan for the company.

438
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,832
And fun's way more fun
with some scratch in your pocket.

439
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:50,124
Like, say we want to have kids one day.
How are we supposed to afford that?

440
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,374
I'm sorry, now you want to have kids?

441
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,415
Not really, but I know you will.

442
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,624
So what else do we have to do?

443
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,957
Mosh pit? Cool.

444
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,624
Get tattoos?

445
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,125
Why not matching?

446
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Find true love?

447
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:12,000
Baby, I want to make true love to you
right now on the Crate and Barrel.

448
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,499
Mm-mm.

449
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:20,707
Alex, come on!
You're totally overreacting!

450
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,624
Come up and let's talk about this!

451
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:26,250
You don't have to work
at the video game company. I was joking!

452
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,916
It was a joke!

453
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,166
It was a funny joke.

454
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,833
I hope you're happy.

455
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,458
No thanks.

456
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,749
<i>Your mother would be so happy.</i>

457
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,165
Yeah, well, like Zoe said,
what have I got to lose?

458
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:13,666
I'm single, unemployed,
and I like crossing things off of lists.

459
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:18,874
Plus, it's the only way
that I get to see my mom's DVDs, right?

460
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:23,165
Yes, there's another one waiting for you
every time you do an item on the list.

461
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,082
- Can I ask you something?
- Yep.

462
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,582
DVDs? Seriously?

463
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:31,583
Your mother wanted you to have something
tangible, you know, that you could keep.

464
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,582
Is that your girlfriend?

465
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,624
Nina. She lives in Chicago.

466
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,708
- May I?
- Yeah.

467
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,165
Wow.

468
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:46,249
- She's, like, really beautiful.
- You say that like it's a big surprise.

469
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:53,291
Well, she has amazing cheekbones and
what appears to be a perfect body. And...

470
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,166
And you have lunch on your tie.

471
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,582
That's funny.

472
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,332
You should let me know
when you do the stand-up.

473
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,749
I will put Nina back.

474
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,957
Is this what it's going to be like
with us the whole time?

475
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,874
I'm just doing what your mom asked me to.

476
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:08,791
That's it.

477
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,625
I'm sorry.

478
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,000
And in the meantime...

479
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,749
How hard can it be to read a book?

480
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,665
Shit.

481
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:15,165
{\an8}<i>♪ Look at, look at, look at ♪</i>

482
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,791
{\an8}<i>♪ I can see everything ♪</i>

483
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:21,165
{\an8}<i>♪ Babies double-dutching
Singing their names ♪</i>

484
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:24,415

485
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:27,332
<i>♪ Look at, look at, look at ♪</i>

486
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,207
<i>♪ I can see everything ♪</i>

487
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,165
<i>♪ Babies double-dutching

488
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,416
<i>♪ Counting off time doing their thing ♪</i>

489
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,207
{\an8} I keep losing friends too.

490
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:50,332
I'm like the Marie Kondo of friendships...

491
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,707
...if Marie Kondo
was the one getting thrown out.

492
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,749
First time?

493
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,832
I ran into a friend
the other day, and...

494
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,832
It'll be fine.

495
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,665
She looked great. She had a baby bump.

496
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,999
Even if you bomb, you look amazing.

497
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,374
-  "Didn't know you were expecting."
- Like your T-shirt. It's really hot.

498
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,790
I'd totally bang your T-shirt.

499
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:07,874
I slept with him.

500
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:13,457
This is all the time I have. Thank you.
Give it up for your host. Good night.

501
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,874
I'm Jackson.

502
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,415
- Hey. Alex.
- Hey.

503
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,999
Our next victim...

504
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,124
- You want to hang later?
-  ...I mean guest, is first-timer...

505
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:24,999
- Not really.
- ...Alex Rose. So, let's give him a hand.

506
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,165
Hello, everyone.

507
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,500
Hi.

508
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,916
You were probably expecting a guy
when you heard the name Alex.

509
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,458
I get that a lot.

510
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:44,082
I mean, it wasn't easy
growing up with a guy's name.

511
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,957
I'd come home crying
after all the kids teased me,

512
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:50,332
and I'd beg my brother Joanne
to beat them up.

513
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,499
You're not funny!

514
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,874
But I'd still make out with you.

515
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,541
Uh...

516
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,125
So, where were we?

517
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:10,040
So, when I was 15, I had this big crush
on my brother's friend, Jeremy,

518
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:16,540
and he'd come home after school, and I'd
sidle up next to him, all cool and sexy,

519
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,415
and I'd say, "What's up?" And he'd say...

520
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:20,874
Blow me!

521
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,916
What is wrong with you, bro?

522
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,457
This is Jackson, everyone.

523
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,040
He tried to hit on me backstage
and said he wanted to bang my T-shirt.

524
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:33,582
Thought about it for a second,

525
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,375
but I really like this T-shirt.

526
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:39,374
And honestly, micropenises are so Gen X.

527
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,666
Really, that's all it takes?
Just one dick joke?

528
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:49,332
I would've brought my entire folder.
It's like this big.

529
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,165
Goodnight, New York.

530
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:04,041
Great. And three minutes under time.
That's perfect.

531
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,582
- Hey.
-  Hey.

532
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,665
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, you invited me.

533
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,040
Did I? I hope you enjoyed the train wreck.

534
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:18,000
That wasn't a train wreck.
You got that... that laugh. At the end.

535
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,291
And you get one of these.

536
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,166
One down, 11 to go.

537
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,500
I knew I accidentally invited you
for a reason.

538
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,124
<i>Hi, Bean.</i>

539
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:35,290
<i>I would've given anything
to have seen you on that stage.</i>

540
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,416
<i>Scared shitless, I bet.</i>

541
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,457
Yeah.

542
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,000
<i>But alive, am I right?</i>

543
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,415
<i>You were such a... a fearless kid.</i>

544
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,415
<i>What do you think happened to that?</i>

545
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:48,916
I don't know what happened.

546
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,540
Life.

547
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:53,874
<i>I think you suffered some real setbacks.</i>

548
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,375
<i>And I get it.</i>

549
00:32:55,875 --> 00:33:02,374
<i>But I watched you gradually start to
settle for what was safe and less painful.</i>

550
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:07,624
<i>But, honey, settling is never gonna make
the fear and the pain go away.</i>

551
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,207
<i>And I can tell you that from experience.</i>

552
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,500
<i>So I want you to try something for me.</i>

553
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:19,415
<i>For the next week, I want you to do
something every day that scares you.</i>

554
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:24,374
<i>One thing that makes you feel nauseous
in the pit of your stomach.</i>

555
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:28,999
<i>That's how I felt after your dad left
and I started my business.</i>

556
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,500
<i>Terrifying.</i>

557
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,500
<i>But life-changing.</i>

558
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,458
- <i>Got it?</i>
- Got it.

559
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,125
<i>I will see you on the next one.</i>

560
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,208
<i>Over and out.</i>

561
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,957
You know what, I don't know if I can
handle doing something scary every day

562
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,832
on top of everything else.

563
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:55,583
I could maybe do it twice a week
if I got some Xanax from my assistant.

564
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,290
What would you do first?

565
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,665
That's easy. I would go straight
into old man Sullivan's office

566
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,375
- and ask why I'm not a full partner yet.
- Mm.

567
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,790
It's crazy. Every time I tell myself
I'm gonna do it, I literally feel sick.

568
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,749
It's ridiculous. I'm a grown man.

569
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,208
With ketchup on his tie?

570
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,582
Who once had ketchup on his tie.

571
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,415
Who's too afraid to ask
for what I know I deserve.

572
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:21,707
Okay, so go into Sullivan's office
tomorrow and ask for what's yours.

573
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:25,707
I mean, who cares if he's the scariest,
wrinkliest old dude in New York, right?

574
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,291
Yeah. Yeah, right.

575
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,541
- Yeah, I'll do that tomorrow.
- Mm.

576
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,333
Or maybe the next day.

577
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,791
What about you?

578
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,416
Well, that's a no-brainer.

579
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,583
Make peace with my dad.

580
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,375
We just never really connected.

581
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,999
And because my brothers
are so damn perfect,

582
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,040
he always acts like I'm the screw-up.

583
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,165
But you're not a screw-up.

584
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,375
Really?

585
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,499
Then how come I can't get through
a single chapter of <i>Moby Dick</i>

586
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,165
without falling asleep?

587
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,457
And I still don't have one job interview.

588
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:55,665
Oh, that reminds me.

589
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:58,540
I do pro bono work for a women's shelter
on the Lower East Side.

590
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,540
They have a classroom--

591
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,665
I'm sorry, you do free work
for a women's shelter?

592
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,874
Uh, yeah.

593
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,499
So modest, Bradley.

594
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,082
The point is they have a classroom
for the high school kids that live there,

595
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,833
and they need a teacher
to finish out the rest of the semester.

596
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Any interest?

597
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,458
Maybe.

598
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,166
Yeah.

599
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:20,541
Why are you being so nice to me?

600
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,874
Do you get, like, a bonus
if I actually get my inheritance?

601
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,583
Wow. Okay, now you've hurt my feelings.

602
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,875
I don't know why.

603
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,250
Actually, I just feel like
you'd be a good fit.

604
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:34,958
Hmm.

605
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,832
I know what you're thinking.

606
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,665
What's a girl like me
doing with a book like this?

607
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,915
You're already doing better than me.
I only got to the first chapter.

608
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:13,125
Same. In high school,
and then in college too.

609
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,499
Then the other night I was on TikTok,

610
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,958
feeling a record-breaking level of
self-loathing, and I decided to try again.

611
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,999
Something just clicked,
and I got into the rhythm of it,

612
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,374
and now I... I can't put it down.

613
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,749
So you're saying
I should finally get myself a TikTok?

614
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,207
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

615
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,499
Our regular teacher, Mrs. Monnell,
went into labor a month early,

616
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,040
- so we're grateful you could fill in.
- I'm grateful you asked me.

617
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,832
Now, the goal is
to keep the kids on an even keel

618
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,040
and up to speed on core subjects
while they're living here.

619
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,290
- Which could be weeks, sometimes months.
- Right.

620
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,749
Lesson plans and files for each child.

621
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,457
Later you'll meet with Dr. Taylor,
one of our consulting therapists.

622
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,457
Anything else you need, just ask.

623
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,375
Then I'll tell you
why you probably can't have it.

624
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,083
Good luck.

625
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,375
Good morning.

626
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,500
I'm Miss Rose.

627
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:47,082
Hey, guys, can we just please
quiet down so we can get started?

628
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,333
-  Whoa!
- Aaron!

629
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,124
Aaron, come on. Give me my sweater.

630
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,915
- Can you please give her the sweater?
- It's not even funny.

631
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,207
Aaron, come on, man.
Pink's not even your color.

632
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,999
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thanks.

633
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,582
Some people think
<i>Hamlet</i> is a play about indecision.

634
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,165
You know, the feeling when
you can't decide between Edward and Jacob,

635
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,915
or whoever the hot vampires are
these days.

636
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,832
Miss Rose,
you gotta update your references.

637
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,332
So I want everyone
to write about a time

638
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,332
when they had
something really important to do.

639
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,249
But like Hamlet,

640
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,499
you couldn't quite
find a way to take action.

641
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,832
You have 30 minutes.

642
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,165
Wow, that's really beautiful.

643
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,250
Thank you.

644
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,708
But it's not the assignment we're doing,
is it, Ezra?

645
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,708
Whatever.

646
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,750
You know, that's not a bad word
for thinking about <i>Hamlet.</i>

647
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,416
- Why not use it as a starting point?
- Maybe 'cause I don't care.

648
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,915
Maybe because "to be or not to be"
is a stupid question.

649
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,666
Hmm. Maybe.

650
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,290
Or maybe it's the most important question.

651
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,250
And hey, if you don't agree with me,
then maybe you can write about that.

652
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:17,332
In the meantime, I will take a deeper
dive into your beautiful art.

653
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,582
Hey, give that back!

654
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,708
Absolutely, the second you're done.

655
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,749
Ah! Ow!

656
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,749
- Ezra, what do you think you're doing?
- Taking action.

657
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,000
Oh my God.

658
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,040
He wouldn't do the assignment,
and then he gave me the finger.

659
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,040
Only after you took away
his prized possession.

660
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:38,124
- Right, but I didn't know that.
- It was in the folder I asked you to read.

661
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,665
Ten minutes before class.

662
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:42,874
Alex, these children
are in a very vulnerable place.

663
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:46,207
Before anything else, you have to
understand that if this is gonna work.

664
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:49,832
Ms. Howard, I can teach these kids. I want
to teach them. Please don't fire me.

665
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:50,915
Who's getting fired?

666
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,749
Nobody. Yet.

667
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,957
This is Alex Rose, the teacher
recommended by Brad Ackerman.

668
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,790
And it's her first day,
and it's not going particularly well.

669
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:01,999
Well, I remember your first day, Carol.
Actually, I remember the whole week.

670
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,915
Very funny.

671
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:05,540
Maybe you can help Alex
get the hang of how things work?

672
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,249
Yeah, I'd be delighted.

673
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,583
Girl with <i>Moby Dick.</i>

674
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,833
That did not come out right.

675
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,582
Ezra's mom died last year,
and he and his aunt are here

676
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,749
while she sorts out
a complicated family situation.

677
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,415
My mother died recently.

678
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,458
I'm so sorry.

679
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,915
Thank you. Uh, but I'm thinking

680
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:27,290
maybe it's something
I could connect with him about.

681
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,457
Yeah, it's not a bad idea. It's...

682
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:32,625
I'd just wait a little bit
before trying it out.

683
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,416
- But I--
- Kids like Ezra are a bit like cats.

684
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,707
- Like cats?
- You have to wait for them to come to you.

685
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,665
Even when everything in your body

686
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,832
is screaming out
to scratch them behind their ears.

687
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,707
- Patience--
- ...is a virtue.

688
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:46,999
- Right.
- Yeah, the one that

689
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,875
I'm still getting acquainted with.

690
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:52,707
Thank you, Dr. Taylor.

691
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,249
Anytime, Miss Rose.

692
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,457
Alex.

693
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,541
Garrett.

694
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,957
Should we do the rest of these files?

695
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,874
Sure.

696
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,624
Yeah. Oh shit, I mean, I-I can't.

697
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:08,082
I... I thought we'd be done at six,
and I have a dinner date to get...

698
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,874
With my dad.
I have dinner with... with my dad.

699
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,332
But can we maybe try again?

700
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, I'm here Mondays and Thursdays.

701
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,333
Or you can call me anytime.

702
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,375
Hey, Dad!

703
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,790
Hey.

704
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,999
Sorry, there was a problem on the train.

705
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,040
Well, always leave a little extra time,
then there won't be--

706
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,583
...be any problems, I know.

707
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,832
But a life without problems
would be kind of boring, wouldn't it?

708
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,790
Yeah.
I'll take that under consideration.

709
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,833
Come on. How are you doing?

710
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,249
Good.

711
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,832
A women's shelter. That's... different.

712
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:47,999
But good. Good.
I'm happy you're teaching again.

713
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,624
Thanks. Now if I could just manage
not getting fired.

714
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,082
- Well, don't do that, Alex. Come on.
- What did I do?

715
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,415
That self-deprecating. It's not funny
or charming. You're an adult now.

716
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:57,832
Did you ever think it was funny?

717
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,249
- Not really.
- Yeah.

718
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,458
But as your mother used to say,
my sense of humor's a little... Hm.

719
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,500
You know, she really wanted us
to get along better.

720
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,915
Not be so angry with each other.

721
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:12,624
I'm all for it.
And... and I'm not angry with you.

722
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,249
Okay, sometimes a little frustrated.

723
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,957
Thing is, Dad, I'm really trying
to make this new path for myself,

724
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:22,374
and I'd just like to feel that
you could, you know, support me.

725
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:26,290
Lucas told me about the will.
And of course, anything that you need.

726
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,457
No, not money.

727
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,458
Emotional support, Dad. Jesus.

728
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,750
What?

729
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:40,040
- It seems you're the angry one, not me.
- I'm not angry.

730
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,624
Okay, fine, maybe a little.

731
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,041
About what?

732
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,375
At some basic level,
I always feel like I'm letting you down.

733
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,874
Do you remember when I told you
I was gonna quit teaching?

734
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:53,790
Yeah.

735
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,582
You literally told me
that you weren't surprised.

736
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,499
- No.
- Yeah.

737
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,499
No, I said I was disappointed.

738
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,124
Look, you had a few bumps along the way,

739
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,958
and you gave up on a career
that you cared deeply about.

740
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,750
Like, what was I to do,
lie and give you a hug?

741
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,040
Come on, no disrespect,
but your mother had that covered.

742
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,832
Right, 'cause who in their right mind
would hug their kid

743
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,290
after they've just been unfairly fired?

744
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,165
Also, Mom never lied to me.

745
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,415
Oh, come on!

746
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:20,874
Whatever, this was her idea
of working things out.

747
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,457
- You think your mom was so damn perfect.
- She was pretty awesome.

748
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,290
Yeah, God forbid anyone should say a word

749
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:28,332
that would knock her off her majestic
pedestal, but I promise you, Alex,

750
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,790
she was not perfect,
and she was not a saint.

751
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,040
Oh really? What?
What did she do that was so terrible?

752
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,374
What, she let the dog eat
your Eddie Bauer slippers?

753
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,749
- That's not funny.
- Didn't pay her library fines?

754
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,166
Oh, she cheated on her taxes.
No, wait, cheated on you.

755
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,582
Dad?

756
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,000
Excuse me, can I get the check, please?

757
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,458
Dad.

758
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,875
She cheated on you,
that's what you're saying, isn't it?

759
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:01,333
Dad, you can't just drop a bomb
like that and walk away.

760
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,457
I was 15 when you got divorced,
is that when it happened?

761
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,375
Why are you running away from me? Stop!

762
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,083
Things happen in a marriage, Alex.

763
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:14,707
But we got through it, and we managed
to have some pretty good years together,

764
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,790
so can we please just leave it at that?

765
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:17,833
No, we can't.

766
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,750
Please, I need to know.

767
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,791
It was before you were born.

768
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,000
It wasn't just a fling. Something...

769
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,083
Something else happened.

770
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,666
Oh.

771
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,499
Why don't we go for a walk, sweetheart?

772
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,375
Are you kidding me?

773
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,499
Let me get this straight.

774
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,332
You're saying that Dad...

775
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,833
...is not actually my father.

776
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,875
Mom had an affair
with a musician named Johnny Alvarez.

777
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,625
Apparently he played at a club
they'd go to in the Village.

778
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,416
Um, that's just...

779
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,708
I don't know what to say.

780
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,333
Johnny Alvarez?

781
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,624
Sounds like Mom had a type.

782
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,624
Lucas.

783
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,207
She ended the relationship
when she got pregnant,

784
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:43,582
and she and Dad made this agreement
not to tell me. Or any of us.

785
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:46,291
Like that was the way
that they could save their marriage.

786
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:50,540
Alex, I can't imagine how difficult
it must be to make sense of this.

787
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,625
I'm somewhere between numb
and completely furious.

788
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,041
Like, who am I?

789
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,875
And why didn't anyone,
namely Mom, bother to tell me?

790
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,999
It definitely explains
a lot about me and Dad.

791
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,082
Why he never could love me
the same as you guys.

792
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:09,332
- No.
- Hey, that is not true, okay?

793
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,791
And he's still your father.
He's the man who raised you.

794
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:13,833
I don't know.

795
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:17,165
I think I need to find him.

796
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,999
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

797
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,707
Julian, how can you say that?

798
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,915
Alex should know
who her biological father is.

799
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,957
I know, but the company is
a trusted family brand...

800
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,582
...going through... What?

801
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,040
It's going through a big transition
right now, and if the story gets out--

802
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,624
The story? Are you kidding me?

803
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:38,457
Alex, we are all going to do whatever
we have to do to help you with this.

804
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,999
Okay, that's not what I meant.

805
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,458
- Jesus, why am I always the bad guy?
- Because you're so fucking good at it.

806
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,291
Julian didn't mean that.

807
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,499
He's just been having
a really hard time lately.

808
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,457
With what?

809
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,291
Raising two wonderful children?

810
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,665
Being married to the perfect woman

811
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:07,124
who took the perfect job
that I was apparently unfit to handle?

812
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,416
A hard time that his mother died.

813
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,958
You're not the only one missing her.

814
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,874
<i>I'm here to see Brad Ackerman.</i>

815
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:38,874
I'm Alex Rose.

816
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:39,875
Is he expecting you?

817
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,040
- No, but I'm sure if you--
-  Alex!

818
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,999
- Hey!
- Did we have an appointment?

819
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,957
I-I was just about to go shopping.

820
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:50,832
Nina's coming into town next week,
and I thought it was time for a new tie.

821
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,874
- Because of what I said?
- Yep.

822
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:57,415
You know, I always hoped, if only
I could change just one person's life.

823
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,040
Why are you here?

824
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,832
Uh, I finished <i>Moby Dick.</i>

825
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:04,207
Thought I'd pick up my DVD, and, um,

826
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:06,458
I wanted to ask
for your help with something.

827
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,416
Sure... I think.

828
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,665
The thing I keep obsessing about
is why she didn't tell me.

829
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,290
We told each other everything.

830
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:18,083
Was she afraid or ashamed?

831
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,957
Did she ever give you
a hint about any of it?

832
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:23,624
No, no, she never said a word.

833
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,999
Honestly, the whole thing
seems really just unlikely.

834
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,915
Maybe it's a part of who she really was,

835
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:32,790
and it's one of the reasons she sent me
on this crazy "Alex in Wonderland" journey

836
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,582
to find out for myself.

837
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:36,250
- No, way too boring.
- What?

838
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,500
Make an effort here, Bradley.

839
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,166
So...

840
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,749
Will you help me find Johnny Alvarez?

841
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,540
Yeah, yeah, of course.
We could start by googling him.

842
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:49,499
Wow, you really do think of everything.

843
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,040
Okay, smarty-pants,
what did you come up with?

844
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:56,124
A bandleader named Johnny Alvarez,
except he was born in 1918.

845
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:59,290
Uh, I tried John, Juan, Jonathan...

846
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:01,375
There's, like, a thousand entries.

847
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,125
Perfect...
for your middle school graduation.

848
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,207
Come on, this is
the amazing Tina we're talking about.

849
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,707
Nina, actually.

850
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:18,457
Um, there is someone that I use
on divorce cases, but she's not cheap.

851
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,708
- If the money's a problem, I can talk--
- No, it's not the money. It's...

852
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:27,000
It's like I've fallen down
this weird rabbit hole.

853
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:30,625
Old family secrets, private detectives,

854
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,875
becoming friends with a lawyer.

855
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,999
Nothing makes sense anymore.

856
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,583
So we're friends now?

857
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:45,999
Looks good.

858
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,249
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

859
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,416
Now all you need is a suit to go with it.

860
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,040
I was actually just--

861
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,540
Shh.

862
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,041
- Get a new suit.
- Yeah.

863
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,250
<i>Hiya, Bean.</i>

864
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:04,999
<i>You like my new tripod stick thingy
I got for the camera?</i>

865
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,790
It's not bad, just a little shaky.

866
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,957
<i>Our chair.</i>

867
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:11,666
<i>Hmm. Needs a little love.</i>

868
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,166
<i>Well, I'll have to get that
taken care of before I...</i>

869
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:27,832
Before I... Why is it so hard to say "die"?

870
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:31,291
I'm gonna die.

871
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,666
<i>How does that line go?</i>

872
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:41,250
"What dreams may come
when we shuffle off the mortal coil must..."

873
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,790
- "...must give us pause."
- "...give us pause."

874
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,666
"...must give us pause."
Ah, that's got a nice ring to it.

875
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:52,665
<i>Like I could stick around,
but in some cool dream state</i>

876
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,625
without pain or suffering.

877
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,791
Speaking of suffering,
how friggin' long is this book?

878
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:05,832
I just kept looking for
some sort of inspiring connection

879
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,458
between the book and the list.

880
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,957
<i>But the best I could come up with was,</i>

881
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:14,416
<i>I'm Ahab, you're my whale,</i>

882
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:19,208
<i>and I've set you off
on this hopeless quest.</i>

883
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,915
<i>I mean, I got a lot of nerve.</i>

884
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:23,833
- No, Mom, you have--
<i>- Right?</i>

885
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,458
<i>What am I doing? Playing God?</i>

886
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,625
<i>As if I'm some kind of paragon of...</i>

887
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:36,708
<i>wisdom and virtue, which I can
assure you, my darling, that I am not.</i>

888
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,916
Yeah, so, um,

889
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,375
Dad told me.

890
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
<i>The truth is, I...</i>

891
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,291
I...

892
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,124
Truth is, I woke up this morning,
and I was convinced

893
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:58,125
that I should release you
from this lunatic mission.

894
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,290
<i>But then I looked at the list again,</i>

895
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:05,041
and I'm telling you, I know
you were only 13 when you wrote it...

896
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,583
but it is a map

897
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,000
<i>toward your best self.
You know what I mean?</i>

898
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:17,250
I just... I wanna say, if you're struggling,
or if you're feeling like a failure,

899
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,208
it's okay.

900
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:22,333
<i>There's no shame in asking for help.</i>

901
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,833
I'm learning that now
more and more every day.

902
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,374
"Call me Ishmael."

903
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,665
<i>One of the best first lines ever.</i>

904
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,625
Yeah.

905
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:40,790
<i>Remember how I used to say,
"Call me Mommy."</i>

906
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,249
"But just be sure to call."

907
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,208
All right, my Bean.

908
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,582
Till next time.

909
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,750
I love ya. Over and out.

910
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,708
I remember
you were a very talented student.

911
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:28,290
You had a lot of heart,
but maybe not so much discipline.

912
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,832
Hmm. I wanted to play Green Day
and Fiona Apple,

913
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,458
and you made me do scales and Bach.

914
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,625
So why "Clair de Lune"?

915
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,791
It was my mom's favorite.

916
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:44,125
Your mother was a special lady.

917
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,499
And I was sad to hear about her passing.

918
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,832
I know you don't take on
many students, Ms. Wyman,

919
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:54,791
but it would have meant so much to her
if she knew I was doing this with you.

920
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,458
All right, three conditions.

921
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,290
- You arrive on time...
- Mm.

922
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:04,415
...you practice every day, including scales,

923
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:08,083
and you perform in the June recital.

924
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:03,000
So I was at the library, and I... I saw
some books I thought would interest you.

925
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,082
So now you're trying to buy my respect?

926
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,915
More like loan it.

927
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:09,833
They have to be back in two weeks.

928
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:14,499
I know you're interested in art,
so, um, I found a couple of books,

929
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,583
including this amazing biography
of Egon Schiele.

930
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,625
- He's this--
- I know who he was.

931
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:24,375
Oh, and this DVD.

932
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,540
It's based in New York, present day.

933
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:31,582
It's about 90 minutes, and the actor
who plays Hamlet is, like, really hot,

934
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,916
so maybe give it a shot.

935
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:56,875
Hey, Miss Rose!

936
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:07,707
Yeah.

937
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:11,207
Okay, so I didn't pretend that Ezra
was a cat, and yes, it totally backfired...

938
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:12,290
Yeah, truly.

939
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:13,207
You look nice.

940
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:16,750
No, no, no, that's fine.
Just say hi to Theo from me. Okay, bye.

941
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,457
- Hi.
- Sorry.

942
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,790
- You were saying?
- I didn't pretend Ezra was a cat.

943
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,040
No, no, after that.

944
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:25,415
Oh. Uh, I think I said, you look nice.

945
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,415
That was it. Thank you. You look--

946
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,957
Wet, angry, and frustrated.
I need your help.

947
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,415
You never called me.

948
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:32,583
I know, I meant to.

949
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:36,165
But then all this messed up
family stuff happened--

950
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:37,415
That's a coincidence.

951
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:41,249
Messed-up family stuff is my speciality,
and I really would love to help.

952
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:46,207
It's just, I'm late for a meeting
and I have this thing later, hence,

953
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,458
monkey suit.

954
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,415
Hey, why don't you come with me?

955
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:52,582
My date canceled,

956
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,999
and we can talk about Ezra
or anything you want to talk about.

957
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,832
Oh, I don't know.

958
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:00,832
I'm not really the kind of person
you want to take to a fancy event.

959
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,875
Says who?

960
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,416
-  This is fantastic.
-  Pretty great, isn't it?

961
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,374
Holy shit, is that Patrick Ewing?

962
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,290
Wait, you're into basketball?

963
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:15,082
I was the point guard
at the Ditmas Park Middle School team.

964
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:18,041
I loved the Knicks,
and I need to talk to him.

965
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:21,458
It's kind of a long story.

966
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:24,125
Which I will tell you if you're very good.

967
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:27,791
Well, if you're very good,
I might just introduce you to him.

968
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,790
You know him?

969
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,416
I'm just gonna check my coat.
I'll be right back.

970
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:35,750
Patrick Ewing.

971
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,291
- Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

972
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,207
Aren't you supposed to wear a tux?

973
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:02,624
Aren't you supposed
to be wearing a fancy gown?

974
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,791
Oh, don't be so gender normative.

975
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:08,790
At least you got yourself a nice tie.
You look damn good, counselor.

976
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,125
He does, doesn't he?

977
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,540
Alex, this is Nina Keller.

978
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:14,665
- Ah!
- Nina, this is my client, Alex Rose.

979
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:17,124
It's so nice to meet you, Nina.
I've heard so much about you.

980
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:20,415
Yeah, you too. I think
you may be Brad's favorite client.

981
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:22,290
Nina just got offered a job

982
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,415
heading the Mayor's
Sustained Manhattan Initiative.

983
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,457
- Wow.
- Looks like she's moving back to New York.

984
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,082
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pulled me back in."

985
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:30,749
Well, congrats.

986
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,915
What are you doing here? This is
the last place I'd think to find you.

987
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:34,832
She's with me.

988
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:35,957
Hey.

989
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,124
Garrett.

990
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,915
-  Nina.
- Dr. Taylor.

991
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,915
- You know each other.
-  ...know each other.

992
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:43,790
That makes perfect sense.
Garrett knows everyone.

993
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,207
And I thought I was special.

994
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:49,790
And you are special. Nina and I had
a disastrous date a long time ago.

995
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,832
It's impossible to have
two alphas in a relationship.

996
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,915
Someone always has to be
the beta.

997
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,415
I guess that's where I come in.

998
00:58:56,416 --> 00:59:01,041
Oh, that's not what I meant.
You have all the alpha a girl needs.

999
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,499
Oh, did you hear that?
I have all of the alpha...

1000
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,749
Cheers to your alpha.

1001
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,499
-  To Brad's alpha.
-  Cheers.

1002
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,290
-  Wow. That's... Cheers.
-  I love this so much.

1003
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:13,457
I will have, uh, the 16-year-old scotch.
Thank you.

1004
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,915
it's quite the turnout we got here.

1005
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:17,415
Hey, yeah. Yeah, we did good, right?

1006
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:21,207
Partly thanks to you persuading
the firm to buy, what, three tables?

1007
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,624
Yeah, it was a bit cheaper
than making me partner, so...

1008
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,915
So, you and Nina?

1009
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,624
Yeah. So, you and Alex.

1010
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,665
Oh, she was kind enough
to step in last minute.

1011
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:36,250
Yeah, no, that makes sense.
She doesn't seem like your usual type.

1012
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:38,624
What's my usual type?

1013
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:42,207
- Oh, I don't know. Someone a little less...
-  Tips in the rebound for the win!

1014
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:43,665
And then the crowd goes nuts.

1015
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:44,957
...whatever that is.

1016
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:47,790
Whoa! And it was just epic.

1017
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:51,666
Exactly. The thing
I didn't know I was missing.

1018
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,540
The best Knick ever!

1019
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:58,540
You know, I can't believe
you got Patrick Ewing's email.

1020
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:02,415
I think he was just trying
to get rid of me.

1021
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:03,500
No.

1022
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,083
You totally charmed him.

1023
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,165
Like you totally charmed me.

1024
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,458
You know, I really like talking to you.

1025
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,124
And I really like listening to you talk.

1026
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,208
Well, I really like talking to you too.

1027
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,291
And listening.

1028
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,083
And sometimes,

1029
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:28,625
I like to look really deep into your eyes.

1030
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,583
Are we having a staring competition?

1031
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:34,458
Wow.

1032
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:38,916
Well, don't let me distract you, 'cause
I'm determined to win fair and square, but

1033
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,833
how about a proper date?

1034
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,499
Well, what about the fact that we--

1035
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,583
Work together?

1036
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,457
Technically, I'm a mere consultant.

1037
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,666
There's nothing mere about you.

1038
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:07,916
I've been wanting to do that
ever since I saw you on the A Train.

1039
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,416
So, how about that date?

1040
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,958
What do you think
we've been doing all night?

1041
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:16,749
Oh, okay.

1042
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:32,415
So, Lucas is my bud, always has been.

1043
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,957
His wife is Zoe, and we became best
friends the minute they started dating.

1044
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,832
And, uh, Julian is the number one son
and teaches law at Columbia.

1045
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,290
Wow, I'm impressed.

1046
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:43,375
Yeah, so is he.

1047
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:47,166
Shit, I really didn't want
to be late today.

1048
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:49,041
Look, we're not late.

1049
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:52,958
You don't have anything to prove
to your brothers or your dad or anyone.

1050
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:57,666
Thank you.

1051
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,790
-  Sorry. I'm...
-  If he says lecture...

1052
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,625
-  Garrett's a hit.
- It's fascinating.

1053
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,125
Yeah.

1054
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:06,791
Can I say something?

1055
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,500
You look different. In a really good way.

1056
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:12,916
I feel different.

1057
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,791
I mean, Garrett has
something to do with it, but...

1058
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,665
- It's also this life list thing.
- Yeah?

1059
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:22,458
Yeah. Who knows if I'll do it all, but

1060
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:25,582
I don't know, I wonder
if that's even the point, you know?

1061
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:27,083
What about make peace with Dad?

1062
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:30,874
I think he just wants
to find a way forward.

1063
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,458
I know, I know, but...

1064
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,499
I need to find out about Johnny first, and
we haven't had any luck finding him, so...

1065
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,499
-  Hi, guys, your table is ready.
- Come on up.

1066
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,832
Speaking of the list,

1067
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:45,374
you will never in a million years
believe what I'm doing tomorrow.

1068
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:22,541
That was a wonderful,
original interpretation.

1069
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:27,166
Next up, Alexandra Rose,
playing "Clair de Lune."

1070
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,250
Excuse me. Sorry.

1071
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,415
Remember the summer
when you and your brothers

1072
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:31,207
did the combination
car wash and lemonade stand,

1073
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,999
and your brothers just assumed the money
would go to their video game fund...

1074
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,832
Education is an important part of how we
support our families while they live here.

1075
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,165
But you hung these everywhere

1076
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:44,249
until they finally had to relent,

1077
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,790
and all the money
went to the Humane Society.

1078
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,999
Oh, you're the one?

1079
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,707
{\an8}-  It's me.
- It's you?

1080
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,499
{\an8}- It's you and me.
- Oh my goodness.

1081
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,040
{\an8}- Ready?
- I'm ready for you, girl!

1082
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:03,665
{\an8}What you got, hotshot?

1083
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,665
{\an8}Yeah!

1084
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:23,125
Oh my God! Are you okay?

1085
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:26,749
<i>I thought I said
mosh pits were out of the question.</i>

1086
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,874
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1087
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:35,124
Just don't go anywhere near
a tattoo parlor or any vehicle whatsoever.

1088
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:42,415
I'm trying.

1089
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,582
- I know you're trying, but...
-  Got it?

1090
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:47,374
I want you to write a letter
from you to yourself.

1091
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:50,165
<i>So here we are.
Be a great teacher.</i>

1092
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,666
I watched that movie that you gave me.

1093
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,291
<i>I always knew you were.</i>

1094
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,291
<i>And if you are
actually watching this right now...</i>

1095
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,875
Alex, I'm so proud of you.

1096
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:24,291
- Hi.
- Hey.

1097
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:18,541
Alex?

1098
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:20,500
Alex!

1099
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,041
- Hey!
- Dad.

1100
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,790
What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

1101
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,665
I was just getting coffee
with a... a work friend.

1102
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:29,957
How about you?

1103
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,833
I just had a meeting nearby.
I'm kind of waiting for my Uber now.

1104
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,040
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.

1105
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,999
No, I-I understand.

1106
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,416
I mean, I think I understand.

1107
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,083
I just need a little more time.

1108
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:44,625
I know.

1109
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,166
It's good to see you.

1110
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,165
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1111
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,916
You're not. I'm early.
Uh," Clair de Lune."

1112
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,791
Nine down, three to go.

1113
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,290
Jinx.

1114
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,625
I want to put the detective back on.

1115
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:20,290
I know, I know you're gonna say she hit
a dead end and that it's a lot of money--

1116
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:21,583
I already did it.

1117
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:26,915
I know, you can pay me back later or not.

1118
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:29,583
You could just keep being my stylist. Um...

1119
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:33,541
The point is,
we have to find Johnny, right?

1120
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:38,750
Thanks.

1121
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:40,541
Yeah, of course.

1122
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,833
Ooh, sandwiches.

1123
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,249
So how are things with Garrett?

1124
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,375
Good. Really good.

1125
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:48,833
Okay.

1126
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,375
Why are you looking at me like that?

1127
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,666
It's probably nothing, it's just...

1128
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,915
Do you think it's strange
he never wants to stay at my place?

1129
01:08:56,916 --> 01:09:00,208
Like, he always picks the movie
or the restaurant.

1130
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:03,124
I don't know, it's kind of like
we live entirely in his world

1131
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,499
and only occasionally will he visit mine.

1132
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,665
Yep.

1133
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:07,790
What?

1134
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,582
It doesn't sound like nothing, right?

1135
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:13,749
Like, how do you really know someone
unless you've seen their bookshelves

1136
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,375
or, like, the crazy shit
they keep in their fridge?

1137
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:20,499
How come every time we talk about Garrett,
you get all weird?

1138
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,832
I thought you guys were friends.

1139
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,999
We are friends. Of a certain kind.

1140
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,749
The kind that
don't really like each other?

1141
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:31,375
The point is that you should
talk to him about it before it festers.

1142
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:33,000
Okay.

1143
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:46,540
Sakina grew up here
but works in Mumbai doing microfinancing,

1144
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:49,708
and Russell is the president
of the Psychiatric Institute.

1145
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:51,499
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

1146
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,874
- Uh-huh.
- Can we not talk about the list tonight?

1147
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,415
Why? Everyone loves that story.

1148
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:57,415
It's not a story, it's my life,

1149
01:09:57,416 --> 01:10:00,707
and I'm starting to feel
like a favorite pet trick.

1150
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:04,083
Yeah, no, of course, sure. No life list.

1151
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,750
Are you okay?

1152
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:08,874
Yeah.

1153
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:09,791
Alex?

1154
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,000
It's nothing, it's just...

1155
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,791
How come we never stay at my place?

1156
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,374
Like, make dinner at my place.

1157
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:21,790
Because you love my apartment.

1158
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,625
I do, it's amazing, it's just...

1159
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:25,957
It's yours.

1160
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:29,125
It's your life and your friends and...

1161
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:35,040
I don't know, I thought maybe you'd want
to be a bigger part of my life too.

1162
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:37,999
Yeah, yeah, and we've hung out
with your family. We--

1163
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,500
We had brunch once.

1164
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:45,000
You always say that I should work harder
at unraveling my feelings, so...

1165
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:48,208
Here they are, unraveled.

1166
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,333
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

1167
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:54,915
I'm sorry, you're right, I'm just...

1168
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:57,625
I'm a really bad guest
'cause I'm a bit of a control freak.

1169
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,707
I'm a lot of a control freak.

1170
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,625
Maybe you should see a shrink.

1171
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:06,665
Well, maybe I should
just stay at your place.

1172
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:07,958
Really?

1173
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:09,625
Really.

1174
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:20,541
Oh, just give me one second.

1175
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,750
Hello, Bradley.

1176
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:27,749
Yeah, what's up?

1177
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:32,124
Oh my God.

1178
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,333
- Baby?
- They found my dad!

1179
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,207
They found Johnny.

1180
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,624
He lives in Vermont, and he's still
a musician, just under a different name.

1181
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,999
- Which is why we couldn't find him.
- Incredible.

1182
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,332
Your father was missing?

1183
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,915
No. Yes.

1184
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:48,999
It's kind of a long story,
which I guess now I have to tell you.

1185
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,999
Which is fine because I didn't get
a chance to read your <i>New Yorker</i> article,

1186
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,582
and Garrett says that
we can't talk about Meghan Markle.

1187
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:57,749
Hi, I'm Alex.

1188
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,124
- Hi.
-  Hi.

1189
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:00,082
Hi.

1190
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,499
<i>So, what have you decided?</i>

1191
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,999
Uh, well, Garrett and I are driving up
to Burlington tomorrow.

1192
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,332
I'm gonna show up at the club where
Johnny's band plays and see what happens.

1193
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,415
<i>Are you sure that's not,
like, too in his face?</i>

1194
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:23,290
Maybe, but if I call him out of the blue
and he blows me off,

1195
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,040
I don't know if I can handle that,
you know?

1196
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:28,624
I gotta go.
My first dinner guest has arrived.

1197
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:30,249
- I'll keep you posted.
<i>- Good luck.</i>

1198
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,166
Thanks. Coming!

1199
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:37,040
- Ta-da! Hey!
- Hey!

1200
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:39,000
- How are you?
- Mwah. Come on in.

1201
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:42,749
Place looks fantastic
with all the new furniture. It feels so...

1202
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,875
Small?

1203
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:47,207
It feels so you. So adorable.

1204
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:48,291
You're sweet.

1205
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:52,041
Okay, let me take this to the kitchen
and I'll go get changed.

1206
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,415
Make yourself at home, okay?

1207
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:55,833
Thank you. Yeah.

1208
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:15,290
Oh, don't sit in the armchair.
I have to get the springs fixed.

1209
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,207
Okay.

1210
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,750
Can you get that, please?

1211
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,082
Hi.

1212
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:24,208
Wow. You're even hotter than Alex said.

1213
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:26,915
- I'm Megan.
- I'm--

1214
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:30,790
Garrett, duh. This is my girlfriend,
Nell. Alex, we're here.

1215
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:31,874
Be right there.

1216
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,166
Hey. What's up?

1217
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,665
- Hi.
-  Wow, this place is tiny.

1218
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:38,457
I wonder what she's paying.

1219
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,166
Oh. My. God.

1220
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,582
Alex, you got a tattoo?

1221
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,290
- Is that the... Yeah.
- The list!

1222
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:49,124
I can't believe how much
she's already done.

1223
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:53,291
Oh, except that one
still isn't crossed off.

1224
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:57,290
Get with the program, Garrett.
She's only got till New Year's.

1225
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,582
I got it.

1226
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:02,290
Love her, she's getting the door
in somebody else's house.

1227
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:03,290
Hello.

1228
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,790
- Hi. I'm Zoe.
-  Hey.

1229
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:07,290
- Nell. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, I've heard so much about you.

1230
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,332
Lucas. Nice to meet you.

1231
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,250
Okay, wait.
Shh. I have a good one. I have a good one.

1232
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:15,749
Would you rather time travel
100 years into the past or the future?

1233
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,582
The future, obviously.

1234
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,957
I'm thinking jet packs,
cure for cancer, and we'll live forever.

1235
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,374
That's all well and good,
but at the end of the day...

1236
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:27,332
Who wants to live forever? I mean,
most weeks I can barely make it to Friday.

1237
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,749
-  Or Wednesday.
- Yeah. Exactly.

1238
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,124
-  I'm serious.
-  I want to live in the present.

1239
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:34,082
- Have you read <i>The Power of Now?</i>
-  My God.

1240
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,332
Of course.

1241
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:38,707
My ick is to ask somebody
to Venmo you. Like, I'm not...

1242
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:41,207
-  Oh my God! It's so uncomfortable.
-  Don't do it.

1243
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,707
You're thinking about this too hard.
What's your ick?

1244
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:45,832
You're putting a lot of... Cilantro.

1245
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,624
What? That's how I find out
you don't like cilantro?

1246
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:51,582
Sandals with socks. Sorry, Grandpa.

1247
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,665
-  So problematic.
- What's the point of this?

1248
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:56,957
What? Oh, it's like a thing...
I'll explain later. You guys, I can't...

1249
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,915
No, I need to know what hers is,
because she has a million.

1250
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:03,332
I do have a question for Garrett.

1251
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:04,250
And no judging.

1252
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,832
Have you ever had an affair
with one of your patients?

1253
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:09,957
Seriously?

1254
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:12,833
Why, Megan? Have you ever
slept with one of your doctors?

1255
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,791
Does my dermatologist count?

1256
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,957
Huzzah!

1257
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:22,957
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

1258
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:30,875
<i>♪ Have you ever slept with
One of your doctors? ♪</i>

1259
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:36,665
Is that really how I come across?
Like some kind of creep

1260
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,708
who would sleep with his own patient?

1261
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:42,625
No, it was just a game.
We were just having a good time.

1262
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,707
Admit it, it was a fun night.

1263
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,791
Yep, maybe not for everyone.

1264
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,624
Can I ask you,
when you organized this dinner,

1265
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,249
did you put any thought whatsoever

1266
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,750
into bringing together a group of people
who had something, anything in common?

1267
01:15:57,375 --> 01:16:01,125
You mean besides me? Because I was
kind of hoping that would cover it.

1268
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:05,083
Hey.

1269
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,957
I'm sorry if you were feeling left out
and I didn't... I didn't clock it.

1270
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:12,249
I was just really excited for you
to spend some time with my friends.

1271
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:17,290
Having inane conversation
about absolutely nothing.

1272
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,040
Do you know
what your friend Megan told me?

1273
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:23,165
She said I'd better get my shit together
so you can check true love off your list.

1274
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,374
- She did not.
- Yeah, I dunno what was more insulting,

1275
01:16:25,375 --> 01:16:28,499
the fact that you hadn't checked it off,
or that in some unconscious way

1276
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,625
you're only with me
to get your inheritance.

1277
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,875
I'm going to give you a moment
to reconsider what you just said.

1278
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:39,374
I don't give a shit about the money,
Garrett. Is that what you think of me?

1279
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,165
I honestly don't know what to think

1280
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,499
about tonight, or about
where we are in our relationship.

1281
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,249
We're in my apartment for the first time
since the week I moved in,

1282
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:50,041
with my ridiculous friends
who say inane things.

1283
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,041
Well, maybe I should go.

1284
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,708
Sounds like a plan.

1285
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,500
See you later.

1286
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,957
Garrett, wait.
How am I supposed to get to Vermont?

1287
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,832
-  Pringle?
-  Yes.

1288
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:15,874
Thank you.

1289
01:17:19,125 --> 01:17:20,208
You okay?

1290
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,333
Yeah.

1291
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:24,249
No.

1292
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:27,958
He won't answer any of my calls or texts,
which is just great.

1293
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,165
You guys are amazing for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

1294
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,665
It's an adventure.

1295
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:37,166
If I was meeting my father
for the first time, I'd want some backup.

1296
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,500
What?

1297
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:46,332
I'm trying to put on some weight.

1298
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,749
I'm getting way too good-looking.

1299
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,666
People are starting to think
I'm superficial.

1300
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,915
You see? She never laughs at my jokes.

1301
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:56,915
- You told her that?
- Because you don't.

1302
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:59,374
Maybe I was laughing on the inside.
I don't know.

1303
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:02,124
Well, laugh louder on the inside.

1304
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,415
Oh my God.

1305
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,582
-  No way.
- She laughed.

1306
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,832
-  Let's go.
-  What?

1307
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:08,125
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1308
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:09,541
Hm.

1309
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,749
Hey, can we listen to something else?

1310
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,833

What if my dad doesn't like me?

01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:53,791
What if you don't like him?

1323

Is that you being reassuring?

God, Nina's so beautiful.

1326
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,958
She has a neck like Audrey Hepburn.

1327
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,625
You should check out her ears.

1328
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,083
- Really?
- I'm serious, yeah.

1329
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,333
Wow!

1330
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:27,249
It's like a golden orb
designed by a sun god.

1331
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,332
And her skin.

1332
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:29,375
Yeah.

1333
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:32,166
Is the sex amazing?

1334
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:36,457
I mean, even if it wasn't,
I'd be so impressed with myself,

1335
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:39,290
I would just feel like it was amazing.

1336
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:40,207
Hm.

1337
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,833
Just so you know,
I can hear every word you're saying.

1338
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:50,040
The only annoying thing about her
is that she talks in her sleep.

1339
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,083
Mm.

1340
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:55,207
We are checking in
for Alexandra Rose.

1341
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,625
-  And Bradley Ackerman.
-  Bradley Ackerman.

1342
01:19:58,875 --> 01:19:59,833
The Acker Man?

1343
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:02,374
- Is there a movie star...
-  No.

1344
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:03,750
Come on.

1345
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:08,415
-  Thank you, that's fine.
-  Okay.

1346
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,874
Is there a Bradley Ackerman?

1347
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:13,332
No. That's something
my dad used to say all the time.

1348
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:15,374

Oh.

1350

- We're getting upgraded.
-  Of course.

1351
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,290
Hey! They're upgrading us to a suite.

1352
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:23,208
Great.

1353
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:26,915
- Yes, perfect.
-  Okay, cool. Thank you.

1354
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:27,957
Perfect.

1355

Hello.

1356
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,707
Hey, you ready?

1357
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:44,791
Yep.

1358
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:47,666
Where's Nina?

1359
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,124
Oh, uh, she had a work emergency.

1360
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,666
Luckily she was able to get
a flight back to New York.

1361
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,416
You good?

1362
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,708
How do I look? Is this...

1363
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:00,457
You look great.

1364
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,416
Yeah?

1365
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:03,250
Thanks.

1366
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:05,416
And for being here.

1367
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:09,458
Here we go.

1368
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:11,375
This is gonna be great.

1369
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,500
Yeah.

1370
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,666
It's gonna be great.

1371
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:07,957
Let's just go. This is...
This is a terrible idea.

1372
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,625
Hey, wait. Just, hey.

1373
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:11,375
Look at me.

1374
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,500
Take a breath.

1375
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:20,166
Now, just go over there and talk to him.
Remember, I am right here.

1376
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:22,750
Okay.

1377
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:26,916
Oh shit.

1378
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:28,625
Hey.

1379
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:30,582
Do you have a cell phone?

1380
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:31,582
Uh, yeah.

1381
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:32,957
Yeah? Hand it over.

1382
01:22:32,958 --> 01:22:33,915
What?

1383
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,290
I want to take a selfie.

1384
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:38,707
It will last way longer than you two
staring a hole through my head.

1385
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:39,832
I'm sorry, we--

1386
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,749
Are you from the revenue?

1387
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,624
It's... Uh...
We're not from the IRS.

1388
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:49,875
Actually, my name is Brad,
and this is Alex.

1389
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,125
Alexandra, actually.

1390
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:54,166
Rose.

1391
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:57,874
Hi.

1392
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:58,833
Alexandra.

1393
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:00,958
Surprise.

1394
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,000
Alexandra Carolina Rose.

1395
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:06,249
You know my full name.

1396
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,749
Of course.
I wrote a song when you were born.

1397
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,457
It was called
<i>Una Rosa Con El Nombre De Otra.</i>

1398
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:13,250
A sad love song.

1399
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,500
About Elizabeth and you.

1400
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,415
Did you ever record that?

1401
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:21,583
No. No, no. It was just a way
of dealing with life in the moment.

1402
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,916
So, I'm curious,
what kind of music do you like?

1403
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:27,083
All kinds.

1404
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:31,040
Lately, I've been listening to
this Mexican singer I really like,

1405
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:32,165
Natalia Lafourcade.

1406
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:33,374
Uh-huh.

1407
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,540
Oh, and I've been taking
piano lessons for a while now.

1408
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,915
It's a lot of work
to get good at an instrument.

1409
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,415
Or anything.

1410
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,666
Yeah. Life, for instance.

1411
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,708
To the memory of your beautiful mother.

1412
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,125
Cheers.

1413
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,583
Can I ask you something?

1414
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,165
Were you ever curious about me?

1415
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,333
Of course.

1416
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:05,207
I played a gig in New York
a long time ago.

1417
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,375
And while we were in town, I...

1418
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:11,541
I drove out to Brooklyn and
I parked my car in front of your house.

1419
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,749
I saw your brothers
coming back from school

1420
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:19,749
and Sam honking his horn
as he pulled into the driveway.

1421
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:24,500
And then the front door opens and...

1422
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:29,083
a little girl comes out to greet her dad.

1423
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:32,290
No, I don't think I ever did that.

1424
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:37,125
He swings you round and round, and then
the two of you go back into the house.

1425
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:38,708
No, that...

1426
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,541
That's just not something
that Samuel would do with me.

1427
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:48,791
Maybe because the fact is
he isn't my real father.

1428
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:50,875
You are.

1429
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:56,375
There are facts, and there's what's true.

1430
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,541
And a person needs to make room for both.

1431
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,082
What's his name?

1432
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,000
- Brad.
- Brad.

1433
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,999
Brad seems like a cool guy.
Is he your... your boyfriend?

1434
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,082
- No.
- No?

1435
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,166
No, he's, um...

1436
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,457
He's just a really great friend.

1437
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,000
-  Hey, Johnny.
- Yeah?

1438
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:18,583
You ready?

1439
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:20,749
Yeah. Back to work.

1440
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,040
Right, yeah. Of course.

1441
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,083
Um...

1442
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,874
Can we maybe talk some more after the set?

1443
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:30,207
Uh, that's going to be tricky, but we can
meet tomorrow morning if you want.

1444
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,665
- Where are you staying?
- At the Marriott on Cherry.

1445
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:36,666
Uh-huh. Yeah, they make a pretty good
corned beef hash there, yeah.

1446
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:39,250
Ten in the morning.

1447
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:43,540
That would be wonderful.

1448
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:45,125
I'll see you in the morning.

1449
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:46,666
Bye, Alexandra.

1450
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:00,166
Hey. How'd it go?

1451
01:26:55,291 --> 01:27:00,624
I mean, it was awkward,
but at the same time, it felt so... real.

1452
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:01,916
- Yeah.
- Intimate.

1453
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:03,916
I don't know.

1454
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:07,582
And he has this really cool way
of saying things like,

1455
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:10,124
"There's facts, and there's what's true."

1456
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:14,165
What about when he asked
if we were from "the revenue"?

1457
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,749
- Yeah.
- He's such a man's man.

1458
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,666
I know!

1459
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,457
By the way,
he asked if you're my boyfriend.

1460
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:20,541
- No way.
- Yeah.

1461
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,207
I think he liked you.

1462
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:26,957
So what you're saying is
you're moving to Vermont.

1463
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:29,665
Mm-hmm. I mean, why not? It's beautiful.

1464
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:32,749
- Okay.
- And there's cows, and I love cows.

1465
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:36,915
And there's ice cream.
And my dad lives here.

1466
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:38,540
No, you're a city girl.

1467
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,832
You milking cows?
Are you kidding? That's not--

1468
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:43,249
I wouldn't be milking the cows.
Are you nuts?

1469
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:46,832
There's the facts,
and then there's the truth.

1470
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:51,458
No. No, he said there is facts,
and then there's what's true.

1471
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,207
What's true?

1472
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:57,250
Okay. Fact, this is a glass.

1473
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,458
- Uh-huh.
- Truth...

1474
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:01,540
We need another drink.

1475
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:04,332
-  We already played three by Sinéad.
- We have to play Sinéad.

1476
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:08,249
- Just have some variety in our evening...
- No. No.

1477
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,915
You just pressed every single button.

1478
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:11,832
Now we have no--

1479
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:18,333
Yo! What? You pressed random numbers!

1480
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:23,207
<i>♪ They call me hell
They call me Stacey ♪</i>

1481
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:26,083
<i>♪ They call me Her
They call me Jane ♪</i>

1482
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:29,665
<i>♪ That's not my name
That's not my name ♪</i>

1483
01:28:29,666 --> 01:28:33,833
<i>♪ That's not my name ♪</i>

1484
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:37,915
I can't believe our song came on.

1485
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,874
Your shushing was louder
than you were talking.

1486
01:28:48,541 --> 01:28:51,082
Oh.

1487
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,000
Oh.

1488
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:53,708
Oh, come on.

1489
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:55,583
This is my room.

1490
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:58,625
Sorry.

1491
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:06,083
Good night.

1492
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:08,375
- Good night.
- Good night.

1493
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,041
Yep.

1494
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:57,541
Jinx.

1495
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,915
- This is crazy.
- Should we stop?

1496
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:06,165
No.

1497
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,457
You're a really good kisser.

1498
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:14,625
Thanks. You too.

1499
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,415
Maybe just a little less tongue.
Just tickles a little.

1500
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:20,416
Yeah, okay.

1501
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:25,040
Sorry, I just have a big tongue,
and it's really drunk.

1502
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:25,958
It's okay.

1503
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:32,750
- You know what they say about big tongues.
- What?

1504
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:50,625
Bradley Ackerman.

1505
01:30:51,916 --> 01:30:52,791
Yeah?

1506
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:54,916
Come here.

1507
01:31:57,666 --> 01:31:58,625
Hey.

1508
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,040
Part of me knew he wasn't coming.

1509
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:09,250
Yeah.

1510
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,000
But I'm not gonna cry.

1511
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:16,166
Well, you can if you want to.

1512
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:58,833
The truth is I'm an idiot.

1513
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:04,333
Expecting a total stranger
to make everything right in my life.

1514
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,458
Thank you for coming.

1515
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:29,250
You always talk like
there's something wrong with you.

1516
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,416
It's bullshit.

1517
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:38,500
You're so smart and beautiful
and full of life and...

1518
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:42,958
Every time I see you, you dazzle me.

1519
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:47,540
And if Garrett and your dad are too blind
to see it, then it is their loss,

1520
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:49,374
but it does not have to be ours.

1521
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,833
Except it does.

1522
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:53,625
Last night was wonderful.

1523
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:55,915
But it was a mistake.

1524
01:33:55,916 --> 01:33:59,874
- You have this amazing girlfriend--
- Nina didn't go back because of work.

1525
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:02,833
We got in a fight and broke up.

1526
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,583
What was the fight about?

1527
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:09,833
You.

1528
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,707
Okay. Why didn't you tell me this
before you got into bed with me?

1529
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:16,625
I know I should have.

1530
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:20,499
- Yeah.
- Everything just happened so fast, and...

1531
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:27,583
Ugh...

1532
01:34:28,166 --> 01:34:29,500
Yeah.

1533
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,333
Sorry.

1534
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,333
Don't go. Please, Alex.

1535
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:45,541
Look, Garrett is an amazing guy.

1536
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:48,041
I get it. He's...

1537
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:53,791
sophisticated and accomplished, and he... I...

1538
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:00,000
I don't believe you love him.

1539
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:02,165
I don't even really think you like him.

1540
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:04,749
- You like how you feel about yourself...
- You need to stop talking.

1541
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:05,999
- When you're with him.
- Wow.

1542
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,082
You need validation
even after everything you've done...

1543
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:11,165
- You're full of shit.
- ...since your mom died.

1544
01:35:11,166 --> 01:35:13,416
Telling me what I want
and how to live my life.

1545
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,540
Right, 'cause that would be Garrett's job.

1546
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:21,416
Wow.

1547
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:51,583
It's okay.

1548
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:04,791
The other night wasn't about the list.

1549
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:09,916
I was just freaking out about the broken
armchair, and your friends were...

1550
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:14,458
And the book I gave you
that you didn't read.

1551
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
But then...

1552
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,333
I have just spent the whole weekend
missing you.

1553
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:26,332
I spent the whole weekend
missing your smile

1554
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:29,833
and missing all your goofy stuff.

1555
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:34,916
And I realized that we can do this.
That I can do this.

1556
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,416
You didn't ask me how it went with Johnny.

1557
01:36:42,166 --> 01:36:45,000
I'm so- I'm sorry. How... How did it go?

1558
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:46,875
Not great.

1559
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:50,666
The thing is,

1560
01:36:51,916 --> 01:36:56,291
my messy place,
my friends, the books I read...

1561
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:58,708
They're me, Garrett.

1562
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,041
They're all me.

1563
01:38:10,416 --> 01:38:11,624
Hey.

1564
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:12,708
Hey.

1565
01:38:13,916 --> 01:38:14,916
Shall we?

1566
01:38:17,166 --> 01:38:18,125
Yeah.

1567
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:23,624
I don't understand why
Lucas wants us to meet with a broker.

1568
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:27,083
We can't put the house on the market
until the new year.

1569
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:35,375
If you don't mind me asking, how are you?

1570
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:39,041
Good. How are you? How are the kids?

1571
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:40,583
They miss you.

1572
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,208
Yeah, me too.

1573
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:46,415
When is Lucas getting here?
I have stuff to do.

1574
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,375
I'm here! Hey!

1575
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:51,707
Hi, what's up?

1576
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:53,832
- Where's the broker?
- Broker's not coming.

1577
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:54,874
What?

1578
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:56,958
Yeah, I've got something
I want to show you.

1579
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,625
Just, it's gonna be all right, just...

1580
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:04,083
Whoa, what? I don't understand.

1581
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,124
Camping out under a full moon.

1582
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:08,915
Number seven on the list.

1583
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:10,040
Bingo.

1584
01:39:10,041 --> 01:39:11,582
- This is sweet but...
- No, Chloe--

1585
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:13,665
Guys, just stop. Just shut up.

1586
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:15,332
Both of you shut up, okay?

1587
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:18,458
We are gonna do this so, uh...

1588
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:23,666
Let's crack open the wine, get started.

1589
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,458
Yeah?

1590
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:28,458
Yeah.

1591
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:32,000
So I got there at 10, and

1592
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:34,499
half an hour went by, and then an hour.

1593
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,083
And Johnny never showed up,
and you're just sitting there waiting.

1594
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:40,333
Must've been so tough, Alex.

1595
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,290
I'm sorry.

1596
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:43,875
I wasn't totally surprised.

1597
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:45,916
I liked him.

1598
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,207
But even though he told me stuff,
it kind of felt like he was

1599
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:52,457
- holding something back, you know?
-  Mm-hmm.

1600
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:55,583
Have you called Dad?
Since you-you got back?

1601
01:39:56,916 --> 01:40:00,666
I mean, I-I get it.
You're not... You're not ready, but...

1602
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:03,625
All he does is ask about you.

1603
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,665
Remember when you said
that finding out about Johnny

1604
01:40:08,666 --> 01:40:11,041
explained a lot about
your relationship with Dad?

1605
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:14,166
I felt the same way.

1606
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:18,291
Except for me, it was you and Mom.

1607
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:21,083
Your bond.

1608
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,166
Your little secrets
and your private jokes.

1609
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:29,583
Like a club the rest of us
weren't allowed into.

1610
01:40:33,666 --> 01:40:36,833
Maybe for a moment think about
what that was like for Dad.

1611
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:39,125
For Lucas and me.

1612
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,750
Is that how you felt?

1613
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:49,541
Wow.

1614
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:51,875
I had...

1615
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,041
I had no idea.

1616
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:03,500
I think I need another drink.

1617
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:07,916
Ah.

1618
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,041
I just remembered something.

1619
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:22,582
-  Uh...
-  Julian, what are we doing up here?

1620
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:24,708
Uh... Oh yeah.

1621
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:26,915
It's over here.

1622
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:29,457
When's the last time
we were all up here together?

1623
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,416
Ages.

1624
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:32,207
Incredible.

1625
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:34,666
It's still here.

1626
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:39,250
Oh my God, dude.  What?

1627
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:43,332
Julian, you little devil. This whole time
you never said anything?

1628
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:46,875
Look, even anal brainiacs
need to unwind sometimes. Okay?

1629
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,665
Think it's any good?

1630
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:50,875
It's been here for, like, 15 years.

1631
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,291
Well, there's only one way to find out.

1632
01:41:55,625 --> 01:42:00,041
So, Julian came up here
for his secret stash.

1633
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:03,708
What about you, Lucas?
What shenanigans did you get up to?

1634
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,375
I-I lost my virginity

1635
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:10,500
in that corner, on that mattress,

1636
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:12,375
with Valerie Hoffman.

1637
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:14,707
- Wow!
-  Valerie Hoffman?

1638
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:15,832
Yes.

1639
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,415
Dude, she was so out of your league.

1640
01:42:17,416 --> 01:42:18,540
Dude, I know.

1641
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:19,957
Uh...

1642
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:24,165
- I don't know, it was a one-time thing.
- I bet.

1643
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:26,124
It was like, all I remember

1644
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:29,375
is hearing <i>Oprah</i>
on the TV downstairs the whole time.

1645
01:42:31,166 --> 01:42:32,915
What about you, little sister?

1646
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:35,041
Any secrets we should know about?

1647
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:40,166
I used to have these really elaborate
sleepovers with my friends.

1648
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,290
And there was one night
that we each wrote down

1649
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:47,458
all the things that
we wanted to accomplish in life.

1650
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,583
Like, the list?

1651
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:52,458
Yeah.

1652
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,000
Wow.

1653
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:57,749
And here we are.

1654
01:43:02,083 --> 01:43:02,958
Alex?

1655
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,041
Yeah?

1656
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:07,666
What are they like?

1657
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:11,500
The DVDs Mom left you.

1658
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:28,083
- Ready?
- Yes.

1659
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:32,832
<i>Remember the summer
when you and your brothers</i>

1660
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:35,374
<i>did the combination
car wash and lemonade stand,</i>

1661
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:39,915
<i>and your brothers assumed that the money
would go to their video game fund,</i>

1662
01:43:39,916 --> 01:43:43,249
<i>but you hung these everywhere...</i>

1663
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,457
<i>...until they finally had to relent,</i>

1664
01:43:45,458 --> 01:43:48,374
<i>and all the money
went to the Humane Society.</i>

1665
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:51,582
<i>What? I thought I said
mosh pits were out of the question.</i>

1666
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,499
<i>Fine.</i>

1667
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:59,333
<i>Just don't go anywhere near
a tattoo parlor or any vehicle whatsoever.</i>

1668
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,625
<i>I want you to live your best life.</i>

1669
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:04,833
<i>You have to get yourself
out of this hole that you're in.</i>

1670
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:10,833
<i>I'm not gonna be around to dig you out,
but I can sure as hell leave you a shovel.</i>

1671
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:14,290
<i>Do you remember
the cottage we rented upstate?</i>

1672
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:19,332
<i>And at night, we would all go sit out
on the porch together</i>

1673
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:22,208
<i>and just look at the moon and the stars.</i>

1674
01:44:23,583 --> 01:44:30,250
<i>And it seemed like the only time that
we didn't have to talk or tease or argue.</i>

1675
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:34,166
<i>And sometimes you'd curl up
in your father's lap,</i>

1676
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,500
<i>and it was just quiet.</i>

1677
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:44,291
<i>Just a moment
to experience that sense of wonder</i>

1678
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:50,374
<i>and reflect and be grateful
for all that we have.</i>

1679
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:52,416
<i>And most of all, for each other.</i>

1680
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:54,875
Hi.

1681
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:58,375
Hey, Dad.

1682
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:00,791
So happy to see you.

1683
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,791
I would pull up in the driveway,
home from work...

1684
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,958
...run out of the house,
and I'd pick you up and spin you around.

1685
01:45:45,375 --> 01:45:46,790
Mr. Sullivan!

1686
01:45:46,791 --> 01:45:49,458
Alexandra. Wonderful to see you.

1687
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:52,875
Even if you don't exactly
seem thrilled to see me.

1688
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:56,665
Sorry, it's just,
I thought Mr. Ackerman would be here.

1689
01:45:56,666 --> 01:45:58,457
Bradley sends his regrets.

1690
01:45:58,458 --> 01:46:01,958
Now that he's a full partner,
his schedule is more complicated.

1691
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,290
I'm sorry. Did you say he's a partner?

1692
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,749
He marched into my office
and gave me an ultimatum.

1693
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:09,290
I couldn't decide
whether to rap him on the knuckles

1694
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:11,125
or ask what took him so long.

1695
01:46:11,666 --> 01:46:13,166
I assume that's for him.

1696
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:16,832
Oh. It's nothing. It's just a tie.

1697
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:19,915
- Mm.
- And a bib, just a little joke between us.

1698
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:21,541
I'll make sure he gets it.

1699
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:26,582
So, when Elizabeth proposed
this little scheme,

1700
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:28,832
I told her she was off her rocker.

1701
01:46:28,833 --> 01:46:32,040
That's when we agreed it'd be wise
to have someone like Bradley

1702
01:46:32,041 --> 01:46:33,749
handle the particulars.

1703
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:37,916
In any case, I hope you haven't
suffered too much this last year.

1704
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:41,750
I had my moments. But, um...

1705
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,541
I guess that was partly the point.

1706
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:47,833
The thing is, Mr. Sullivan, um...

1707
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:51,375
I didn't finish the list.

1708
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:57,915
Seems true love continues to elude me.

1709
01:46:57,916 --> 01:46:59,915
True love is a bitch.

1710
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,791
Ask any of my ex-wives.

1711
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:06,666
Is there like a consolation prize?

1712
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,208
A week at Club Med?

1713
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:10,541
- I'm afraid not.
- Yeah.

1714
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:12,458
Just this.

1715
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:18,290
Your mother didn't think it was fair

1716
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:21,915
to expect you to find true love
with a ticking clock.

1717
01:47:21,916 --> 01:47:25,375
And I quote,
"I just hope she won't settle for less."

1718
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:29,541
Your inheritance, my dear.

1719
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,540
The house?

1720
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:56,166
Her wish from the start.

1721
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:59,750
Why we had to go through the theatrics...

1722
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:02,582
There's a small trust

1723
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:06,124
to help cover taxes and maintenance,
and if you're not ready to move in,

1724
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:08,790
you can rent it out until you are.

1725
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:10,791
Entirely up to you.

1726
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:14,374
Oh dear. You're crying.

1727
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:16,082
I'm not good at crying.

1728
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:19,416
Let me get my assistant.

1729
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:48,000
Okay.

1730
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,375
<i>Alex, my darling.</i>

1731
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,833
Mom.

1732
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:59,124
<i>Here we are. You did it.</i>

1733
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:01,249
Barely.

1734
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:02,791
<i>I never doubted you.</i>

1735
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:07,375
<i>I want to say that being your mom</i>

1736
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:11,000
<i>has been the joy of my life.</i>

1737
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,082
<i>And now you're at a new beginning.</i>

1738
01:49:14,083 --> 01:49:18,958
<i>And I will not be haunting you anymore.
No more lists and ultimatums.</i>

1739
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:21,583
<i>You got this.</i>

1740
01:49:22,958 --> 01:49:26,540
<i>So there may be just one more thing.</i>

1741
01:49:28,791 --> 01:49:31,790
<i>Life is beautiful
and messy and complicated,</i>

1742
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:35,332
<i>and sometimes it doesn't look
the way you think it's supposed to look,</i>

1743
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,958
<i>and that is okay.</i>

1744
01:49:38,625 --> 01:49:42,125
<i>Keep going and always be brave.</i>

1745
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:44,165
I will.

1746
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:46,291
<i>And as for true love,</i>

1747
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:50,125
<i>I'll admit I never really
figured that one out.</i>

1748
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:52,250
<i>But I do know this.</i>

1749
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:55,375
<i>Love is worth fighting for.</i>

1750
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:58,875
<i>Understood?</i>

1751
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:02,207
-  <i>Hey, Mom.
- Hi!</i>

1752
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:03,499
<i>I made you some tea.</i>

1753
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:04,957
<i>Oh honey. Thank you.</i>

1754
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:05,916
<i>Of course.</i>

1755
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:11,791
<i>- What are you doing with that?
- I am doing a little project.</i>

1756
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
<i>You'll see.</i>

1757
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:23,166
<i>I love you so much, Bean.
Forever and always.</i>

1758
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:25,583
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

1759
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:27,666
I love you too, Mom.

1760
01:50:34,041 --> 01:50:34,916
Bye.

1761
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:06,791
Oh shit!

1762
01:51:14,416 --> 01:51:21,165
<i>♪ Are you callin' me bird?♪</i>

1763
01:51:21,166 --> 01:51:26,666
Zoe, what are
the four true love questions?

1764
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:28,874
<i>♪ They call me hell ♪</i>

1765
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:29,790
Shit.

1766
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:30,832
<i>♪ They call me-- ♪</i>

1767
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:51,540
What are you doing?

1768
01:51:51,541 --> 01:51:53,541
What does it look like I'm doing?

1769
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:58,457
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?
I was trying to apologize to you.

1770
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:00,540
Okay, well, apology accepted,

1771
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:03,874
and I'm sorry too,
but you didn't have to hit my car.

1772
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:07,165
- Can we go inside? Please, I need to talk.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1773
01:52:07,166 --> 01:52:10,040
- But--
- I really don't think it's a good idea

1774
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:13,540
with everything that's happened
between us. I'm sorry, but

1775
01:52:13,541 --> 01:52:15,708
making up and being friends again?

1776
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,749
It's not gonna happen.

1777
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:20,083
But I didn't say
that I wanted us to be friends.

1778
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:23,999
Okay, that settles that.

1779
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,083
Goodnight.

1780
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:27,500
I want us to be more.

1781
01:52:28,666 --> 01:52:31,375
Like, a lot more.

1782
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:40,040
You didn't the last time I saw you.

1783
01:52:40,041 --> 01:52:43,457
Maybe I did,
but I was just too confused to know,

1784
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:48,666
and maybe I just needed to ask myself
a few important questions.

1785
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:52,790
Um, four, to be exact.

1786
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:54,207
You wrote them down?

1787
01:52:54,208 --> 01:52:58,291
"One. Is he kind?" Meaning you.

1788
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:01,708
No question. You're like a puppy dog.

1789
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,374
You might as well be a Labrador Retriever.

1790
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:06,332
I had a lab when I was a kid.

1791
01:53:06,333 --> 01:53:09,458
"Two, can I tell him
everything in my heart?"

1792
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:12,875
Well, duh.

1793
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:18,166
I've been telling you everything pretty
much uncensored since the day we met.

1794
01:53:20,875 --> 01:53:24,708
"Three. Does he help me
become the best version of myself?"

1795
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,333
Well, that's a no-brainer.

1796
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:33,125
I mean, do you think
that there's any chance that

1797
01:53:33,833 --> 01:53:36,666
I would have gotten through
the last year without you?

1798
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:40,166
Done any of it...

1799
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,458
without you?

1800
01:53:47,125 --> 01:53:48,374
And the fourth one?

1801
01:53:48,375 --> 01:53:49,541
Oh. Um...

1802
01:53:51,208 --> 01:53:52,208
Doesn't matter.

1803
01:53:53,583 --> 01:53:57,000
The important thing is
the answer is yes, so there.

1804
01:53:57,708 --> 01:53:58,916
Four for four.

1805
01:54:02,166 --> 01:54:03,458
So what happens now?

1806
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:15,583
Wow.

1807
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:17,708
It's true what they say.

1808
01:54:18,583 --> 01:54:21,083
Senior partners really do kiss better.

1809
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:25,250
- We do everything better.
- Everything?

1810
01:54:31,291 --> 01:54:33,124
<i>Five, four,</i>

1811
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:39,332
three, two, one. Happy New Year!

1812
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:43,665
Happy New Year, Bradley Ackerman.

1813
01:54:43,666 --> 01:54:44,999
Who would've thought?

1814
01:54:56,625 --> 01:54:57,915
Happy New Year.

1815
01:54:57,916 --> 01:54:59,374
Happy New Year.

Cheers. Love of your life?

1817
01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:03,083
Don't embarrass me.

1818
01:55:06,166 --> 01:55:07,665
Happy New Year, Zoe.

1819
01:55:07,666 --> 01:55:09,125
Happy New Year, my love.

Ezra.

1822
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:13,665
- Miss Rose.
- Happy New Year.

1823
01:55:13,666 --> 01:55:14,624
Happy New Year.

1824
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:15,874
Parsons, this one.

1825
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:17,374
- No way!
- Can you believe it?

1826
01:55:17,375 --> 01:55:19,749
- Yeah.
-  You didn't tell me that part.

1827
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,082
- Yeah.
-  That's amazing!

1828
01:55:21,083 --> 01:55:23,665
Hi, Kelly.
Happy New Year. How's the baby?

1829
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,250
Oh, big.

1830
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:27,500
Hi, Dad.

1831
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,040
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, sweetheart.

1832
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:33,750
-  I'm really happy you're here.
- Good to be here.

1833
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:38,374
Oh God, Ms. Howard and Dad.

1834
01:55:38,375 --> 01:55:40,665
- Keeping an eye on you.
-  No plotting against me.

1835
01:55:40,666 --> 01:55:42,582
Oh, we will. You're toast, you're done.

1836
01:55:42,583 --> 01:55:45,332
- That's not a thing.
- ...your point. You're done.

1837
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:47,832
- Giving you a hard time?
- They're inventing...

1838
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:52,124
You didn't tell me that your ex-boyfriend
made <i>American Zombie: Blood Apocalypse.</i>

1839
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:56,957
- That game is so unoriginal and boring.
- Good save.

1840
01:55:56,958 --> 01:55:59,374
That's what it felt like
after playing it for 36 hours.

1841
01:56:01,375 --> 01:56:03,082
Okay. Hey, everyone.

1842
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:06,624
Hey, gather around, you beautiful
revelers. Come on, come inside.

1843
01:56:08,083 --> 01:56:10,333
I wanted to make a toast. Um...

1844
01:56:11,791 --> 01:56:14,707
It is so incredible to be in this house,

1845
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:18,499
this house that Lucas
and Alex and I grew up in.

1846
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,957
As you all know, this wasn't
the easiest year.

1847
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:23,041
It tested us.

1848
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:27,124
So thank you to old friends,

1849
01:56:27,125 --> 01:56:32,750
to new friends, and finally,
to our lovely dear mother.
