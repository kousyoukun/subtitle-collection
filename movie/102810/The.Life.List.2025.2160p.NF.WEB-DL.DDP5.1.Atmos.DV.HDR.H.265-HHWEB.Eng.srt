00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,958
Okay, I'll stop.

164
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,958
For now.

165
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you.

166

You're welcome.

167
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,500
I have news too.

[whispers] It's back.

170
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,250
Yeah.

171
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,625
Okay.

172
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,875
Okay, so they'll just have to get rid of it again.

173
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,625
No.

174
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,625
We'll find another doctor, and…

175
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,000
And I read about these treatments they're doing in Germany

176
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,875
that apparently are really effective.

177
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,083
And I will stop working…

178
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,083
-Alex. -And move in.

179
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,708
And I will take care of you until you get better.

180
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,791
No.

181
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,500
No magic treatments in Germany.

182
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,083
No cure that's ten times worse than the disease.

183
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,625
It's not going to make a difference.

184
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,916
Not this time.

I didn't know Dad was gonna be here.

I just hate when he talks as if

206
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,875
the divorce was some kind of mutual decision.

207
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,916
Like, bro, he left her.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,250
I hope your mom was clear about dividing stuff up.

209
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,208
You don't wanna be like the Nelsons. They don't talk to each other anymore.

210
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:04,000
Agreed. As long as I get the Tamayo painting in the front hall.

211
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,583
God, Mom's barely been gone a week, and all you can talk about is her stuff?

212
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,875
That's easy for you to say. You're inheriting the company.

You don't know that. I've barely worked a year.

Why do you think Catherine spent so much time training you?

215
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,083
God, you make me sound like a pet.

216

Stop it, both of you.

Alex is doing great at work.

She's entirely ready for what's ahead.

219
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,416
Hello, everyone. Apologies for being late.

220
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,416
I'd just like to say how truly sorry I am for your loss.

221
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,291
Uh, who are you exactly?

222
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,458
My name is Brad Ackerman.

223
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,500
I worked with your mother on the final draft of her will.

224

-Where's old man Sullivan? -Mr. Sullivan is in his office.

Um, it's Brad, right?

226
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,875
I'm sorry, but are you even a partner here?

227
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm an associate partner.

228

[hushed] Maybe we should ask to see his law degree.

229

You must be Alex.

00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,583
And let me guess,

231
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,583
Julian, Catherine, Lucas, and Zoe.

232

Congratulations on the birth of your daughter, Emma.

233
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,208
Thank you.

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,625
Your mother was an amazing woman.

235
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Even when she was sick, she was so strong and funny,

236
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,541
and, I don't know if this makes any sense,

237
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,583
present in everything that she said and did.

238
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,958
I'm honored she chose me to be the executor of her estate.

239
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,791
Shall we begin?

240

"I, Elizabeth Rose,

241

"It is my wish that neither the house nor its contents

[Julian] Whoa, sorry to interrupt.

258
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,041
Did our mother explain why she wanted us to keep the house?

259

I wish we could keep it forever.

The house is Mom. It's our history.

Yeah, that's sweet, Alex. Do you know what the taxes are?

262
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,041
Brad, are you sure she understood how expensive this will be?

263
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,166
In fact, she made provisions to cover any costs.

Aren't there, like, laws or something against that?

I've been doing estate planning at the firm for three years now.

Three years. Wow.

You're basically a regular Thurgood Marshall.

That's nice, thank you. I appreciate that.

-Please don't talk to me like that. -Or what? You'll take away my inheritance?

290
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,750
I'd like you to consider that your mother was a very intelligent woman

whose main concern is what's best for you.

-Right, as in firing me. -Trust her.

-And disinheriting me. -She did not disinherit you.

Her only daughter. And I get nothing. Not even a piece of furniture!

and jewelry and whatever.

But the thing is,

00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,416
yesterday, the only thing that I wanted was her bed.

299
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,083
That's it. I just wanted her old rickety iron bed

300
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,791
so I could just lay in it and curl up…

301
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,666
and just pretend that she was still with me.

I know how close you and your mother were.

She told me many times.

306
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,375
She just had something else in mind for you.

307

What is this?

308
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,083
She wanted you to open it when you were alone.

309
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,666
Do you have a DVD player?

310
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,458
Yeah. It's in the closet next to the VCR and the butter churn.

My boyfriend has an Xbox.

Yeah, that'll work.

Go home. See what's in the envelope.

00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,583
You must be so pissed off.

325
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,791
[scoffs] It's not funny, Mom, and--

326
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,375
It's not funny, I know.

327
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,000
But I'm gonna explain, okay?

328
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:14,166
Last week, I was getting my so-called affairs in order.

329
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,333
Oh my God, the crap that we hold onto for no apparent reason.

330
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:23,041
But it was actually this amazing life flashback. You know?

331
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,791
I mean, it was actually a you flashback.

332
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,208
I got to… Look at all this stuff I found.

333
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,416
Look, all your finger paintings, report cards.

334
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,291
But in the middle of it all, I found this piece of paper.

335
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,416
A life list.

336
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,708
Your life list.

337
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,375
I love this list.

338
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,708
[sighs]

339
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:54,375
This list is such a reflection of who you are.

340
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
Who I was. I was 13 when I wrote it.

341
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,791
And I know, obviously, you have changed.

342
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,625
Oh my God, it's like she's listening to me.

343
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,458
And I think that's my concern,

344
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,916
is that I don't know that you have replaced this with anything.

345
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,541
I wonder, have you given up your dreams and your aspirations?

346
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,541
Your goals?

347
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,666
And don't tell me Rose Cosmetics, because

348
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,750
I feel like I gave you this cozy job

349
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,500
that allowed you to run away from who you really are.

350
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,208
-[scoffs] Thanks a lot. -So okay, let's look at the list.

351
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,666
"Help people and make a difference."

352
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,833
"Be a great teacher."

353
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,500
Alex, you are a born teacher.

354
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,583
Okay, "learn to drive, get a tattoo." You can skip those, please, dear God.

355
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,375
-[Alex laughs] -My one request…

356
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,875
"Find true love."

357
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,291
Why do I have a horrible feeling you've given up on that too?

358
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,666
[whispers] That's not fair.

359
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,208
I want you to know how incredible you are.

360
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,291
I want you to live your best life.

361
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,458
You have to get yourself out of this hole you're in.

362
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,791
I'm not in a hole.

363
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,541
I'm sorry, that's not up for discussion.

364
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,875
I'm not gonna be around to dig you out, but I can sure as hell leave you a shovel.

365
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,833
I want you to complete this list, Bean.

366
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,166
Hold on.

367
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,916
Mom, you can't just say that and…

368
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,333
Okay. Every time you check off something from the list,

369
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,541
Brad is going to give you one of these DVDs,

370
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,000
which I am going to record.

371
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:44,291
And once the list is completely finished, you will get this envelope.

372
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,791
But the clock is ticking.

373
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,166
The list has to be finished by New Year's. Otherwise, no envelope.

374
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,041
Oh my God, I can't believe this.

375
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,916
I'm not screwing around, Bean.

376
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,125
This is serious business.

377
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,500
This is your life.

378
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,208
And I love you.

379
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,458
See you on the next DVD.

380
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,166
[sighs]

381
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,875
[Megan] This is crazy.

382
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,708
"Go all out in a mosh pit."

383
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,125
-"Play one-on-one with a New York Knick." -[Zoe laughs]

384
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,541
"Do stand-up comedy." Walk me through that.

385
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:34,625
Lucas and I once swore that we would do open mic night at the Comedy Cellar.

386
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,500
And… and I still have the jokes I wrote.

387
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,833
-I gonna need to read those. -"Make peace with Dad."

388
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,375
"Be a great teacher." You can do these.

389
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,875
-Mm-hmm. -You should do these.

390
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,500
Why? So I can inherit some money?

391
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,500
-Yeah. -No, it's just gross.

392
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,583
Besides, I swore that I would never step foot into a classroom ever again.

393
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,500
Oh my God, who cares? Temp for a couple of weeks.

394
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,333
Roll out one of those rickety TVs, pop on Land Before Time, and then voilà.

395
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,375
Or maybe you enjoy teaching again.

396
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,041
Isn't that the idea here?

397
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,333
Not my idea.

398
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,125
Alex. I've known you for a long time.

399
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,250
You'd never enjoy running that company, no matter what you tell yourself.

400
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,375
Love when you guys get real.

401
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,291
Hmm, "Find true love."

402
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,791
You love Finn, right?

403
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,375
He's so sweet, so fun.

404
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,708
Apparently has a ginormous willy.

405
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,750
There's been three new iPhones since you've been together.

406
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,416
You should know by now if you love the guy.

407
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,208
Yeah, but living together was just supposed to be like a temporary thing,

408
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:34,541
and then Mom got sick, and it just seemed, you know, easier not to find my own place.

409
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,833
Which is exactly what she meant.

410
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,625
You're not dealing with shit.

411
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,625
Like not telling Finn about the list?

412
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,541
Do you remember when Lucas and I broke up before we got engaged?

413
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,708
The whole world remembers. Didn't Anderson Cooper do a special?

414
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,916
Hilarious.

415
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,916
I asked your mom for advice, and she told me about her true love test.

416
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,500
Remember that?

417
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,125
Vaguely.

418
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,291
There's four questions you're supposed to ask yourself?

419
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,458
Or is that Passover?

420
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,333
Yes, four questions.

421
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,083
One, can you tell him everything in your heart?

422
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,000
Two, is he kind?

423
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,875
Three, does he help you become the best version of yourself?

424
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,666
Meaning?

425
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,625
Alex in full flight with Finn.

426
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Four, can you imagine him as the father of your children?

427
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,875
[thoughtful music playing]

428
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,166
Elizabeth said to ask myself those questions,

429
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,833
and if Lucas passed, I was on my way.

430
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,833
This is totally crazy. I know.

431
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,416
But I trust your mom.

432
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,375
Besides, what have you got to lose?

433
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:58,875
[Alex] Is Finn kind?

434
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,541
Absolutely.

435
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,541
Does he help me become the best version of myself?

436
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,708
Can I tell him everything in my heart?

437
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,541
I can barely tell myself.

438
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,458
Can I imagine him being the father of our children?

439
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,583
-[zombie moaning] -[person screaming]

440
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,291
What the hell are you doing?

441
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,208
-Oh, hey, babe. -Hi.

442
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,541
I'm just, uh… [coughs]

443
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,000
…doing the stoner test of my game.

444
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,083
The what?

445
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,750
The stoner test?

446
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,708
Kids like to play video games stoned,

447
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,833
so you have to make sure it's still easy enough while you're high,

448
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,958
but still super challenging when you're not high.

449
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,333
Know what I mean?

450
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,666
I need to talk to you about something.

451
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,708
Like, now?

452
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,791
Yeah.

453
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,041
You know, as a life motivator, this is kind of genius.

454
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,875
I think you should totally go for it. I mean, it's your inheritance.

455
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,958
-Really? -Yeah.

456
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,166
Think about how much freedom it would give you. Both of us, actually.

457
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,541
I mean, I could finish designing American Zombie,

458
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,541
you'd run the company instead of teaching.

459
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,583
What company?

460
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,625
The gaming company I'm always talking about.

461
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:19,125
You'd be like the… the brander or whatever, and we'd hang 24-7.

462
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,791
Wait, is that how you see me?

463
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,875
Working for you at your non-existent gaming company?

464
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,958
No, it's our company.

465
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,500
Come on, it'd be fun working together again.

466
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,875
Remember when we used to have fun before your whole

467
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,083
[hushed] death fixation?

468
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,541
Finn, my mother just died.

469
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:38,458
I know, but I think you should try having fun again, because fun is so… so…

470
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,791
-So fun? -Yeah.

471
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,875
Fun's fun. That's actually… See, that's a great slogan for the company.

472
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,833
And fun's way more fun with some scratch in your pocket.

473
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:50,125
Like, say we want to have kids one day. How are we supposed to afford that?

474
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,375
I'm sorry, now you want to have kids?

475
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,416
Not really, but I know you will.

476
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,625
So what else do we have to do?

477
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,875
[poignant music playing]

478
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,958
Mosh pit? Cool.

479
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,625
Get tattoos?

480
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,125
Why not matching?

481
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Find true love?

482
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:12,000
Baby, I want to make true love to you right now on the Crate and Barrel.

483

00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,500
Then how come I can't get through a single chapter of Moby Dick

644
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,166
without falling asleep?

645
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,458
And I still don't have one job interview.

646
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,666
Oh, that reminds me.

647
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,541
I do pro bono work for a women's shelter on the Lower East Side.

648
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,541
They have a classroom--

649
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,666
I'm sorry, you do free work for a women's shelter?

650
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,875
Uh, yeah.

651
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,500
So modest, Bradley.

652
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:08,083
The point is they have a classroom for the high school kids that live there,

653
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,833
and they need a teacher to finish out the rest of the semester.

654
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Any interest?

655
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,458
Maybe.

656
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,166
Yeah.

657
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:20,541
Why are you being so nice to me?

658
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,875
Do you get, like, a bonus if I actually get my inheritance?

659
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,583
Wow. Okay, now you've hurt my feelings.

660
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,875
I don't know why.

661
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,250
Actually, I just feel like you'd be a good fit.

662
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:34,958

665
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,666
What's a girl like me doing with a book like this?

666
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,916
You're already doing better than me. I only got to the first chapter.

667
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,125
Same. In high school, and then in college too.

668
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,500
Then the other night I was on TikTok,

669
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,958
feeling a record-breaking level of self-loathing, and I decided to try again.

670
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:22,000
Something just clicked, and I got into the rhythm of it,

671
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,375
and now I… I can't put it down.

672
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,750
So you're saying I should finally get myself a TikTok?

-so we're grateful you could fill in. -I'm grateful you asked me.

679
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,833
Now, the goal is to keep the kids on an even keel

680
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:54,041
and up to speed on core subjects while they're living here.

-Which could be weeks, sometimes months. -Right.

Later you'll meet with Dr. Taylor, one of our consulting therapists.

Anything else you need, just ask.

Then I'll tell you why you probably can't have it. [laughs]

-[students laugh] -[Alex sighs]

706
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,333
[Alex] So I want everyone to write about a time

707
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,333
when they had something really important to do.

708
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,250
But like Hamlet,

709
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,500
you couldn't quite find a way to take action.

710

But it's not the assignment we're doing, is it, Ezra?

00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,708
Whatever.

716
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,750
You know, that's not a bad word for thinking about Hamlet.

717
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,416
-Why not use it as a starting point? -Maybe 'cause I don't care.

718
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,916
Maybe because "to be or not to be" is a stupid question.

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,666
Hmm. Maybe.

720
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,291

Thank you. Uh, but I'm thinking

753
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,291
maybe it's something I could connect with him about.

754
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,458
Yeah, it's not a bad idea. It's…

755

I'd just wait a little bit before trying it out.

-But I-- -Kids like Ezra are a bit like cats.

-Like cats? -You have to wait for them to come to you.

With my dad. I have dinner with… with my dad.

But can we maybe try again?

773
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, I'm here Mondays and Thursdays.

774
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:19,333
Or you can call me anytime.

Hey.

Sorry, there was a problem on the train.

778
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:30,041
Well, always leave a little extra time, then there won't be--

779
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,583
…be any problems, I know.

780
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,833
But a life without problems would be kind of boring, wouldn't it?

781
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,791
[laughs] Yeah. I'll take that under consideration.

782
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,833
Come on. How are you doing?

783
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,250
[Alex] Good.

784
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,833
A women's shelter. That's… different.

785
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:48,000
But good. Good. I'm happy you're teaching again.

786
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,625
Thanks. Now if I could just manage not getting fired.

787
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,083
-Well, don't do that, Alex. Come on. -What did I do?

788
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:56,416
That self-deprecating. It's not funny or charming. You're an adult now.

789
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,833
Did you ever think it was funny?

790
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,250
-Not really. -Yeah.

791
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:03,458
But as your mother used to say, my sense of humor's a little… Hm.

792
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,500
You know, she really wanted us to get along better.

793
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,916
Not be so angry with each other.

794
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,625
I'm all for it. And… and I'm not angry with you.

795
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:15,250
Okay, sometimes a little frustrated.

796
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,958
Thing is, Dad, I'm really trying to make this new path for myself,

797
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:22,375
and I'd just like to feel that you could, you know, support me.

798
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:26,291
Lucas told me about the will. And of course, anything that you need.

799
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,458
No, not money.

800
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:31,458
Emotional support, Dad. Jesus.

801
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:35,750
What?

802
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:40,041
-It seems you're the angry one, not me. -I'm not angry.

803
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,625
Okay, fine, maybe a little.

804
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,041
About what?

805
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,375
At some basic level, I always feel like I'm letting you down.

806
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,875
Do you remember when I told you I was gonna quit teaching?

807
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:53,791
Yeah.

808
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,583
You literally told me that you weren't surprised.

809
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:57,500
-No. -Yeah.

810
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,500
No, I said I was disappointed.

811
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,125
Look, you had a few bumps along the way,

812
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,958
and you gave up on a career that you cared deeply about.

813
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,750
Like, what was I to do, lie and give you a hug?

814
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,041
Come on, no disrespect, but your mother had that covered.

815
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,833
Right, 'cause who in their right mind would hug their kid

816
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:15,291
after they've just been unfairly fired?

817
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,166
[scoffs] Also, Mom never lied to me.

818
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,416
Oh, come on!

819
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,875
Whatever, this was her idea of working things out.

820
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,458
-You think your mom was so damn perfect. -She was pretty awesome.

821
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,291
Yeah, God forbid anyone should say a word

822
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,333
that would knock her off her majestic pedestal, but I promise you, Alex,

823
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:30,791
she was not perfect, and she was not a saint.

824
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:34,041
Oh really? What? What did she do that was so terrible?

825
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,375
What, she let the dog eat your Eddie Bauer slippers?

826
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,750
-That's not funny. -Didn't pay her library fines?

827
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,166
Oh, she cheated on her taxes. No, wait, cheated on you.

828
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,583
Dad?

829
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,000
Excuse me, can I get the check, please?

830
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,458
Dad.

831
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,875
She cheated on you, that's what you're saying, isn't it?

832
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:01,333
Dad, you can't just drop a bomb like that and walk away.

833
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,458
I was 15 when you got divorced, is that when it happened?

834
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,375
Why are you running away from me? Stop!

835
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,083
Things happen in a marriage, Alex.

836
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:14,708
But we got through it, and we managed to have some pretty good years together,

837
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,791
so can we please just leave it at that?

838
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:17,833
No, we can't.

839
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,750
Please, I need to know.

840
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,791
It was before you were born.

841
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,000
It wasn't just a fling. Something…

842
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,083
Something else happened.

843
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,666
Oh.

844
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,500
Why don't we go for a walk, sweetheart?

845
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,583
[emotional music playing]

846
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,375
Are you kidding me?

847
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,500
Let me get this straight.

848
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,333
You're saying that Dad…

849
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,833
…is not actually my father.

850
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,875
Mom had an affair with a musician named Johnny Alvarez.

851
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,625
Apparently he played at a club they'd go to in the Village.

852
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,416
Um, that's just…

853
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,708
I don't know what to say.

854
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,333
Johnny Alvarez?

855
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,625
Sounds like Mom had a type.

856
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:34,625
Lucas.

857
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,208
She ended the relationship when she got pregnant,

858
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:43,583
and she and Dad made this agreement not to tell me. Or any of us.

859
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,291
Like that was the way that they could save their marriage.

860
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:50,541
Alex, I can't imagine how difficult it must be to make sense of this.

861
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,625
I'm somewhere between numb and completely furious.

862
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,041
Like, who am I?

863
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,875
And why didn't anyone, namely Mom, bother to tell me?

864
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,000
It definitely explains a lot about me and Dad.

865
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,083
Why he never could love me the same as you guys.

866
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:09,333
-No. -Hey, that is not true, okay?

867
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:11,791
And he's still your father. He's the man who raised you.

868
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:13,833
I don't know.

869
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:17,166
I think I need to find him.

870
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

871
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,708
Julian, how can you say that?

872
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,916
Alex should know who her biological father is.

873
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,958
I know, but the company is a trusted family brand…

874
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,583
-[Lucas sighs] -…going through… What?

875
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:31,041
It's going through a big transition right now, and if the story gets out--

876
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,625
The story? Are you kidding me?

877
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:38,458
Alex, we are all going to do whatever we have to do to help you with this.

878
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay, that's not what I meant.

879
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:43,458
-Jesus, why am I always the bad guy? -Because you're so fucking good at it.

880
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:51,750
[footsteps approaching]

881
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,291
Julian didn't mean that.

882
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,500
He's just been having a really hard time lately.

883
00:46:58,583 --> 00:46:59,458
With what?

884
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:01,291
Raising two wonderful children?

885
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,666
Being married to the perfect woman

886
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,125
who took the perfect job that I was apparently unfit to handle?

887
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,416
A hard time that his mother died.

888
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,958
You're not the only one missing her.

889
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,666
[emotional music playing]

890
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,875
[Alex] I'm here to see Brad Ackerman.

891
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:38,875
I'm Alex Rose.

892
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:39,875
Is he expecting you?

893
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,041
-No, but I'm sure if you-- -[Brad] Alex!

894
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,000
-Hey! -Did we have an appointment?

895
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,958
I-I was just about to go shopping.

896
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:50,833
Nina's coming into town next week, and I thought it was time for a new tie.

897
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,875
-Because of what I said? -Yep.

898
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:57,416
You know, I always hoped, if only I could change just one person's life.

899
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,041
[laughing] Why are you here?

900
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,833
Uh, I finished Moby Dick.

901
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:04,208
Thought I'd pick up my DVD, and, um,

902
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:06,458
I wanted to ask for your help with something.

903
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,416
Sure… I think.

904
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,666
[Alex] The thing I keep obsessing about is why she didn't tell me.

905
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,291
We told each other everything.

906
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,083
Was she afraid or ashamed?

907
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,958
Did she ever give you a hint about any of it?

908
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:23,625
No, no, she never said a word.

909
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:27,000
Honestly, the whole thing seems really just unlikely.

910
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:28,916
Maybe it's a part of who she really was,

911
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,791
and it's one of the reasons she sent me on this crazy "Alex in Wonderland" journey

912
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,583
to find out for myself.

913
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,250
-No, way too boring. -What?

914
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,500
Make an effort here, Bradley.

915
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,166
So…

916
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,750
Will you help me find Johnny Alvarez?

917
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,541
Yeah, yeah, of course. We could start by googling him.

918
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,500
Wow, you really do think of everything.

919
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:52,041
Okay, smarty-pants, what did you come up with?

920
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:56,125
A bandleader named Johnny Alvarez, except he was born in 1918.

921
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:59,291
Uh, I tried John, Juan, Jonathan…

It's like I've fallen down this weird rabbit hole.

930

Old family secrets, private detectives,

931

becoming friends with a lawyer.

Well, I'll have to get that taken care of before I…

Before I… Why is it so hard to say "die"?

I'm gonna die.

00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,916
I mean, I got a lot of nerve.

962
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,833
-No, Mom, you have-- -Right?

963
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,458
What am I doing? Playing God?

964
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,625
As if I'm some kind of paragon of…

965
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:36,708
wisdom and virtue, which I can assure you, my darling, that I am not.

966
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,916
Yeah, so, um,

967
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,375
Dad told me.

968
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
The truth is, I…

969
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:46,291
I…

970
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,125
Truth is, I woke up this morning, and I was convinced

971
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:58,125
that I should release you from this lunatic mission.

972
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,291
But then I looked at the list again,

973
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:05,041
and I'm telling you, I know you were only 13 when you wrote it…

974
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,583
but it is a map

975
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,000
toward your best self. You know what I mean?

976
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:17,250
I just… I wanna say, if you're struggling, or if you're feeling like a failure,

977
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,208
it's okay.

978
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:22,333
There's no shame in asking for help.

979
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,833
I'm learning that now more and more every day.

980
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,375
"Call me Ishmael."

981
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:36,666
One of the best first lines ever.

982
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,625
Yeah.

983
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:40,791
Remember how I used to say, "Call me Mommy."

984
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:43,250
[both] "But just be sure to call."

[woman] I remember you were a very talented student.

992
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:28,291
You had a lot of heart, but maybe not so much discipline.

993
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,833
Hmm. I wanted to play Green Day and Fiona Apple,

994
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:34,458
and you made me do scales and Bach.

995
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,625
So why "Clair de Lune"?

996
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,791
It was my mom's favorite.

997
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:44,125
Your mother was a special lady.

998
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:48,500
And I was sad to hear about her passing.

999
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,833
I know you don't take on many students, Ms. Wyman,

1000
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:54,791
but it would have meant so much to her if she knew I was doing this with you.

1001

All right, three conditions.

-You arrive on time… -Mm.

…you practice every day, including scales,

1004
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,083
and you perform in the June recital.

So now you're trying to buy my respect?

00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:17,583
including this amazing biography of Egon Schiele.

Oh, and this DVD.

1022
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,541
It's based in New York, present day.

1023
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:31,583
It's about 90 minutes, and the actor who plays Hamlet is, like, really hot,

That was it. Thank you. You look--

Wet, angry, and frustrated. I need your help.

That's a coincidence.

Hey, yeah. Yeah, we did good, right?

1099
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,208
Partly thanks to you persuading the firm to buy, what, three tables?

1100
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,625
Yeah, it was a bit cheaper than making me partner, so…

Yeah. So, you and Alex.

Oh, she was kind enough to step in last minute.

[Brad] Yeah, no, that makes sense. She doesn't seem like your usual type.

What's my usual type?

I think he was just trying to get rid of me.

1116
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,500

01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:35,375
If you don't mind me asking, how are you?

1753
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:39,041
Good. How are you? How are the kids?

1754
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:40,583
They miss you.

1755
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,208
Yeah, me too.

1756
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:46,416
When is Lucas getting here? I have stuff to do.

1757
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,375
[Lucas] I'm here! Hey!

1758
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:51,708
Hi, what's up?

1759
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,833
-Where's the broker? -Broker's not coming.

1760
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:54,875
What?

1761
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:56,958
Yeah, I've got something I want to show you.

1762
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,625
Just, it's gonna be all right, just…

1763
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:04,083
Whoa, what? I don't understand.

1764
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,125
[Alex] Camping out under a full moon.

1765
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:08,916
Number seven on the list.

1766
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,041
Bingo.

1767
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,583
-This is sweet but… -No, Chloe--

1768
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:13,666
Guys, just stop. Just shut up.

1769
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,333
Both of you shut up, okay?

1770
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:18,458
We are gonna do this so, uh…

1771
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:23,666
Let's crack open the wine, get started.

1772
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,458
Yeah?

1773
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:28,458
Yeah.

1774
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:32,000
[Alex] So I got there at 10, and

1775
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:34,500
half an hour went by, and then an hour.

1776
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:37,083
And Johnny never showed up, and you're just sitting there waiting.

1777
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:40,333
Must've been so tough, Alex.

1778
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,291
I'm sorry.

1779
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:43,875
[Alex] I wasn't totally surprised.

1780
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:45,916
I liked him.

1781
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,208
But even though he told me stuff, it kind of felt like he was

1782
01:39:50,291 --> 01:39:52,458
-holding something back, you know? -[Julian] Mm-hmm.

1783
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:55,583
Have you called Dad? Since you-you got back?

1784
01:39:56,916 --> 01:40:00,666
I mean, I-I get it. You're not… You're not ready, but…

1785
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:03,625
All he does is ask about you.

1786
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,666
Remember when you said that finding out about Johnny

1787
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:11,041
explained a lot about your relationship with Dad?

1788
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:14,166
I felt the same way.

1789
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:18,291
Except for me, it was you and Mom.

1790
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:21,083
Your bond.

1791
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,166
Your little secrets and your private jokes.

1792
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:29,583
Like a club the rest of us weren't allowed into.

1793
01:40:33,666 --> 01:40:36,833
Maybe for a moment think about what that was like for Dad.

1794
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:39,125
For Lucas and me.

1795
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,750
Is that how you felt?

1796
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:49,541
Wow.

1797
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:51,875
I had…

1798
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,041
I had no idea.

1799
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:03,500
I think I need another drink.

1800
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:07,916
[Lucas] Ah.

1801
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,041
I just remembered something.

1802
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:22,583
-[Julian] Uh… -[Alex] Julian, what are we doing up here?

1803
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:24,708
Uh… Oh yeah.

1804
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:26,916
It's over here.

1805
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,458
[Lucas] When's the last time we were all up here together?

1806
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:30,416
[Alex] Ages.

1807
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:32,208
Incredible.

1808
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,666
[laughs] It's still here.

1809
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:39,250
-Oh my God, dude. [laughing] What? -[Alex splutters]

1810
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:43,333
Julian, you little devil. This whole time you never said anything?

1811
01:41:43,416 --> 01:41:46,875
Look, even anal brainiacs need to unwind sometimes. Okay?

1812
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,666
Think it's any good? [sniffs]

1813
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,875
It's been here for, like, 15 years.

1814
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,291
Well, there's only one way to find out.

1815
01:41:55,625 --> 01:42:00,041
[Alex, stoned] So, Julian came up here for his secret stash.

1816
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:03,708
What about you, Lucas? What shenanigans did you get up to?

1817
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,375
I-I lost my virginity

1818
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:10,500
in that corner, on that mattress,

1819
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:12,375
with Valerie Hoffman.

1820
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:14,708
-Wow! -[Alex] Valerie Hoffman?

1821
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:15,833
Yes.

1822
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:17,416
Dude, she was so out of your league.

1823
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,541
Dude, I know.

1824
01:42:18,625 --> 01:42:19,958
-[Alex snickers] -Uh…

1825
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:24,166
-I don't know, it was a one-time thing. -I bet.

1826
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:26,125
[Lucas] It was like, all I remember

1827
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:29,375
is hearing Oprah on the TV downstairs the whole time.

1828
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,166
[Julian and Alex laugh]

1829
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:32,916
[Julian] What about you, little sister?

1830
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,041
Any secrets we should know about?

1831
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:40,166
I used to have these really elaborate sleepovers with my friends.

1832
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,291
And there was one night that we each wrote down

1833
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:47,458
all the things that we wanted to accomplish in life.

1834
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,583
[Lucas] Like, the list?

1835
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:52,458
Yeah.

1836
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,000
[Lucas] Wow.

1837
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:57,750
And here we are.

1838
01:42:57,833 --> 01:42:59,291
[Alex exhales]

1839
01:43:02,083 --> 01:43:02,958
Alex?

1840
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:05,041
Yeah?

1841
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:07,666
What are they like?

1842
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:11,500
The DVDs Mom left you.

1843
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:28,083
-Ready? -Yes.

1844
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:32,833
Remember the summer when you and your brothers

1845
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:35,375
did the combination car wash and lemonade stand,

1846
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:39,916
and your brothers assumed that the money would go to their video game fund,

1847
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,250
but you hung these everywhere…

1848
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:45,458
-[brothers laughing] -…until they finally had to relent,

1849
01:43:45,541 --> 01:43:48,375
and all the money went to the Humane Society.

1850
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:51,583
What? I thought I said mosh pits were out of the question.

1851
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:53,500
-[Alex laughs] -Fine.

1852
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:59,333
Just don't go anywhere near a tattoo parlor or any vehicle whatsoever.

1853
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,625
I want you to live your best life.

1854
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:04,833
You have to get yourself out of this hole that you're in.

1855
01:44:05,583 --> 01:44:10,833
I'm not gonna be around to dig you out, but I can sure as hell leave you a shovel.

1856
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:14,291
Do you remember the cottage we rented upstate?

1857
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:19,333
And at night, we would all go sit out on the porch together

1858
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:22,208
and just look at the moon and the stars.

1859
01:44:23,583 --> 01:44:30,250
And it seemed like the only time that we didn't have to talk or tease or argue.

1860
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:34,166
And sometimes you'd curl up in your father's lap,

1861
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,500
and it was just quiet.

1862
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:44,291
Just a moment to experience that sense of wonder

1863
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:50,375
and reflect and be grateful for all that we have.

1864
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:52,416
And most of all, for each other.

1865
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:54,875
Hi.

1866
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:58,375
Hey, Dad.

1867
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:00,791
[Samuel] So happy to see you.

1868
01:45:04,041 --> 01:45:08,083
[uplifting music playing]

1869
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,791
I would pull up in the driveway, home from work…

1870
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,958
…run out of the house, and I'd pick you up and spin you around.

1871
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:36,083
[music fades out]

1872
01:45:41,083 --> 01:45:42,291
[door opens]

1873
01:45:45,375 --> 01:45:46,791
Mr. Sullivan!

1874
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:49,458
Alexandra. Wonderful to see you.

1875
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:52,875
Even if you don't exactly seem thrilled to see me.

1876
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:56,666
Sorry, it's just, I thought Mr. Ackerman would be here.

1877
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:58,458
Bradley sends his regrets.

1878
01:45:58,541 --> 01:46:01,958
Now that he's a full partner, his schedule is more complicated.

1879
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,291
I'm sorry. Did you say he's a partner?

1880
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:06,750
He marched into my office and gave me an ultimatum.

1881
01:46:06,833 --> 01:46:09,291
I couldn't decide whether to rap him on the knuckles

1882
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:11,125
or ask what took him so long.

1883
01:46:11,666 --> 01:46:13,166
I assume that's for him.

1884
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:16,833
Oh. It's nothing. It's just a tie.

1885
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:19,916
-Mm. -And a bib, just a little joke between us.

1886
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,541
I'll make sure he gets it.

1887
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:26,583
So, when Elizabeth proposed this little scheme,

1888
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:28,833
I told her she was off her rocker.

1889
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:32,041
That's when we agreed it'd be wise to have someone like Bradley

1890
01:46:32,125 --> 01:46:33,750
handle the particulars.

1891
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:37,916
In any case, I hope you haven't suffered too much this last year.

1892
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:41,750
I had my moments. But, um…

1893
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,541
I guess that was partly the point.

1894
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:47,833
The thing is, Mr. Sullivan, um…

1895
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:51,375
I didn't finish the list.

1896
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:57,916
Seems true love continues to elude me.

1897
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,916
True love is a bitch.

1898
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,583
[both laugh]

1899
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:03,791
Ask any of my ex-wives.

1900
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:06,666
Is there like a consolation prize?

1901
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,208
A week at Club Med?

1902
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:10,541
-I'm afraid not. -Yeah.

1903
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:12,458
Just this.

1904
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:18,291
Your mother didn't think it was fair

1905
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:21,916
to expect you to find true love with a ticking clock.

1906
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,375
And I quote, "I just hope she won't settle for less."

1907
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:29,541
Your inheritance, my dear.

1908
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:38,833
[exhales]

1909
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,541
The house?

1910
