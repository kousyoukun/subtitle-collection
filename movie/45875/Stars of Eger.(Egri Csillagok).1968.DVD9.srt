You have my Ieave to speak!

8
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,874
The most renowned
AnatoIian war Iord, begIer bey,

00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,672
reports to your
IIIustrious Majestry!

10
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,633
The Emperor Ferdinánd

11
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,237
who most impudentIy cIaims that he
is the Hungarians's rightfuI king

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,273
has forced our army
to retreat from Vienna.

13
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,274
János ZápoIya,

14
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,951
whom we regard
as the rightfuI king of Hungary,

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,748
stiII possesses
the fortress of buda.

16
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,476
May he Iive Iong
in its possession!

17
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,717
We shaII have great need of him.

18
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,158
May the peasant pIough
his fieId and sow in peace!

19
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,432
And in the countryside
what of that?

20
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,799
There is peace,

21
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,789
order

22
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,913
and tranquiIity.

23
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,917
Star! Star!

24
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,709
Star!

25
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,989
Star!

26
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,349
Star!

27
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,114
Star!

28
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,355
Star!

29
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,030
Star!

30
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,271
Got you at Iast,
you oId vagabond!

31
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,039
Run, Éva!

32
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,028
Gergõ! Gergõ!

33
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,517
Gergõ where are you?

34
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,510
Éva

35
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,309
where are you?
It's time for supper,

36
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,075
dammit.

37
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,552
You shouIdn't swear, front of
father Marton, my sweet.

38
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,474
- I'm used to it.
- Yes, weII, I'm not!

39
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,829
Dammit.

40
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,995
I wiII say it hundred times,
if I have to. Dammit.

41
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,277
- We Iet them together before...
- That kid, dammit.

42
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,835
And you, too.

43
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,955
Why didn't you teII me?

44
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,913
They Ieft earIy in the morning,
they must be home soon.

45
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,912
Now, I beIieve they wiII come.

46
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,674
If the Turks Iet them.

47
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,877
They are in the nearby again.

48
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,551
Stop taIking. Get the horses.

49
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,436
Mr. Cecey, stay here and send
someone after us if they arrive.

50
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,159
1350
LittIe Éva!

51
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,430
Why haven't we heard something.

52
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,390
LittIe Éva, my darIing chiId!

53
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,393
And why hasn't
my husband come back yet?

54
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,433
Try to be caIm, dear.
You must trust in God.

55
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,792
besides,
both of them are armed.

56
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,991
HopeIess to go on searching.

57
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,635
We have no cIear tracks
and few torches.

58
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,552
We'II began again at dawn.

59
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,593
- Oh! My dear husband
- Don't taIk to me!

60
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,598
Don't say a word!

61
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,230
I won't hear anything tonight.

62
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,517
Come on, Éva. This Iooks safe.
We'II sIeep here.

63
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,589
They've escaped!

64
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,513
They've escaped! Hey!

65
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,919
They've stoIen my horse!

66
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,191
You'II soon find another horse!

67
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,518
You fooI!

68
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,235
The TaIisman was hidden away
under my saddIe

69
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,953
The ring beIonging to my father.

70
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,350
It was a sacred TaIisman
and it's been stoIen

71
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,312
A IittIe infideI brat stoIe it!

72
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,596
This was
under the saddIe bIanket

73
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,433
A taIisman ring

74
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,989
with five star

75
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,352
- Then young Gergõ can have it.
- And aII this goId here?

76
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,959
That stays.

77
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,631
You must know where those
two IittIe brats have gone.

78
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,473
Who are their parents?

79
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,077
Tie them to the trees
The infideI swine!

80
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,477
Wait a moment,
Iet's try to get this cIear.

81
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,275
First there was the Tuck
with one eye And then?

82
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,118
The one with the Iash,
that's two

83
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,998
And the one with the moustache,
thats, three.

84
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,714
- So there were about fifteen
of them? - That's right.

85
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,874
- Come on Éva, it's bed-time.
- I want to stay with Gergõ.

86
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,399
No. Go to bed, Éva.

87
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,112
Now, Gergõ the men rode away

88
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,915
Do you know in which direction?

89
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,835
- Yes! but onIy from horseback.
- NaturaIIy.

90
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,514
- Who who?
- I wiII teII you.

91
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,318
A hungarian father

92
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,952
and a hungarian mother.

93
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,794
Run!

94
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,674
Quick!

95
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,269
LittIe Éva?

96
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,958
SIeeps Iike a top.

97
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,478
Dobó shouId have come back...

98
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,600
Once he starts fighting...

99
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,997
Why did he take
that bronemissza kid?

100
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,235
Don't worry.

101
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,919
He is tough as iron.

102
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,309
Peasant.

103
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,150
When you are a grown man,
you've got to be courageous

104
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,389
as you were today,

105
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,068
Gergõ bornemissza.

106
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,554
And I'II have a IoveIy wife.

107
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,233
And have you made
your choice aIready?

108
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,799
- Not me, she has.
- Who is he?

109
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,268
LittIe Éva.

110
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,114
WeII, untiI then I'm sending you
to báIint Török at Szigetvár

111
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,709
for your education!

112
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,838
You'II be one of his pages.

113
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,032
- Are you gIad?
- Yes, very gIad.

114
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,118
Don't be
too gIad about it, my boy.

115
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,512
It's going to mean ten years!
And at the end of it,

116
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,758
you'II be fit to handIe
this sword. It's yours.

117
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,631
Why shouId I have to do this?

118
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,431
Why me, GergeIy? Who am I?

119
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,159
báIint Török, baron of Hungary,
Chief of the Hungarian forces.

120
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,477
And the infant King
summoned by our subIime SuItan,

121
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,673
who wiII Iead them
into his snare.

122
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,158
It's Friar György's mind...

123
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,076
I cannot make head or taiI of it.

124
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,879
Though the SuItan Iikes him.

125
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,078
Friar György is your adherent.

126
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,355
With the permission of Your
Majesty we asked for his advice.

127
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,911
They didn't bother to ask me.

128
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,515
Effendi

129
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,917
teII me, where is that mighty
army of janissaries going?

130
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,074
For a stroII!

131
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,990
My vaIiant men at arms wouId
Iike to see the wonderfuI

132
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,316
fortress of buda from the inside!

133
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,117
A IittIe stroII at dusk

134
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,314
SimpIy that!

135
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,479
A stroII in honour

136
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,951
of the Iate Hungarian king.

137
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,037
And aII haiI to the Iiving king!

138
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,199
The young heir to the throne is
waited by the subIime Padisah.

139
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,479
Like serfs.

140
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,831
They treat us Iike serfs.

141
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,471
I cannot even sit on my horse.

142
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,918
Sir, Iet's Ieave this pIace,

143
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,518
and Iet báIint Török handIe it.

144
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,669
The most exceIIent Padisah

145
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,916
craves to have audience
with you aIone, my Lord.

146
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,875
We wouId honour him by appearing
before him in proper appareI.

147
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,353
Perhaps there has been
no vioIence.

148
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,028
He wiII negotiate with you
on friendIy terms, my Lord.

149
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,038
See that the gifts are ready.

150
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,349
To make him worthy to visit his
Majesty, the SuItan Pure goId!

151
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,153
- And the Queen?
- She's afraid.

152
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,394
I Iove you Éva.

153
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,149
I know.

154
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,313
Éva Cecey,

155
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,275
Anna Petri, the Iadies-in-waiting
to Queen IsabeIIa.

156
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,073
Pray receive from my hands
the King of your country

157
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,231
who has had the graciousness

158
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,318
to raise his eyes
and Iook upon the SuItan.

159
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,515
- Where is my father?
- And my master?

160
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,076
With AIIah's grace,
he wiII be abIe to enjoy

161
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,632
for years the hospitaIity
of our generous SuItan!

162
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,188
Am I?

163
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,077
What shaII become of me?

164
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,589
Her Majesty,

165
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,958
the widowed Queen of Hungary,
can withdraw to TransyIvania,

166
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,193
because buda fortress feII
without bIoodshed into the hands

167
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,353
of the subIime SuItan and into
the Hands of the Ottoman Empire.

168
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,479
Our mecifuI SuItan

169
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,394
grants your Majesty
safe conduct and passage,

170
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,072
and is pIeased to reiterate
his greetings to the young king.

171
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,555
beIeive me, Madame,
it was the best soIution.

172
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,077
We are packing up, Éva.

173
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,199
A keepsake

174
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,478
of my poor husband.

175
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,633
At Ieast the dress

176
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,639
in which he married me.

177
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,270
We buried him wearing that.

178
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,675
Here is something.

179
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,118
AII that remains of a great King.

180
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,389
Éva

181
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,635
You can speak together.

182
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,998
You wiII come with us
to TransyIvania?

183
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,356
You promised
that the mouth of heII couIdn't

184
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,153
No! PIease, understand me.

185
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,670
I couIdn't hide
behind the skirts of the Queen!

186
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,036
I've got work to do.
Wait for me, Éva.

187
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,273
When you come, darIing,
I'II be waiting.

188
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,839
I am engaged to you,
even without a ring.

189
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,628
This is a man's ring.
Wear it aIways for my sake.

190
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,200
Now at Ieast
we have exchanged rings.

191
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,158
What is there Ieft for us to do?

192
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,672
What do you think, GergeIy?

193
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,390
We shaII ask for heIp,
your Majesty.

194
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,398
We'II go to the Emperor.

195
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,954
Have we, Hungarians
another remedy than begging?

196
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,392
Why do we aIways
have to ask somebody?

197
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,198
We must.

198
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,150
Are you saying Friar György?

199
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,309
Friar György. Interesting.

200
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,912
Interesting.

201
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,878
So a Hungarian bishop, a monk

202
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,876
passed buda
into the hand of the Turks.

203
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,278
- ImpossibIe.
- HoIy Father,

204
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,795
- we are victims of an intrigue.
- That's the excuse

205
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,599
of every cIumsy soIdier.

206
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,111
báIint Török,
Chief of the Hungarian forces,

207
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,277
vanishes in the tent
of the SuItan,

208
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,473
the Turkish army waIks into buda,

209
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,948
and the Hungarian Army
does nothing.

210
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,588
What is this?

211
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,919
A man or a woman?

212
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,870
Which area can be stiII
defended by Fredinand Hapsburg?

213
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,039
If we have the support
of your HoIy Father...

214
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,629
Stay Iike this. In this posture.

215
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,073
If we have the support
of your HoIy Father,

216
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,030
we can successfuIIy defend
Upper Hungary and Transdanubia.

217
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,515
What if I turn to the Iight?

218
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,039
Like this.

219
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,750
WouIdn't my profiIe
be more effective?

220
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,715
We can count on TransyIvania, too.

221
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,069
The widowed Queen retired there
after the occupation of buda.

222
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,909
The widowed Queen?

223
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,959
What widowed Queen?

224
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,319
Make it coIourfuI.
Very coIourfuI.

225
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,550
CouId you take it, gentIemen.

226
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,758
That's aII Ieft in the ceIIar

227
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,195
from the tooIs of my Mr. Cecey.

228
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,271
Nothing eIse.
Everything was taken.

229
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,631
- by the Turk?
- No, by the German.

230
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,836
It is sad that
the Cecey house is so empty.

231
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,836
It isn't empty.

232
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,235
I am stiII here.

233
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,638
AII right, we wiII give it
to him on the way.

234
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,915
On the way?

235
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,033
- We reIease him.
- From IstanbuI? It's hopeIess.

236
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,430
- Honour needs it.
- For those who have it.

237
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,029
Not everyone has Iost
his bravery.

238
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,756
Not everyone wears ItaIian siIk.

239
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,229
Are you taIking to me?

240
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,034
No, I am taIking to
the crow on that tree.

241
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,189
Jancsi!

242
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,075
Stop!

243
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,593
- Hit.
- Go on!

244
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,509
Another hit.

245
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,031
Have you caImed down?

246
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,753
We did not need to.

247
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,872
but some fight
never does any harm.

248
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,510
- IstanbuI?
- IstanbuI.

249
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,916
Stick a fork into that caIf.

250
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,032
Is the Iamb ready yet?

251
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,113
The Iamb is but the capon
wiII need more time.

252
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,591
She Iikes her She Iikes her Iot.

253
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,439
Likes her? Likes who?

254
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,832
The queen is very fond of Éva
Cecey. She give her away herseIf.

255
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,236
If that capon
is aII nice and soft inside,

256
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,953
then it'II be ready to be eaten.

257
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,919
- You said Éva Cecey?
- We are preparing for a betrothaI.

258
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,230
- Who's getting married?
- WeII, I think I'd better go

259
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,954
- and Iook at that capon.
- Why can't that man give

260
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,958
a straight answer when he's
asked a straight question?

261
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,350
- I'II answer for him.
- Did you say Éva Cecey?

262
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,478
Yes! She's marrying Lieutenant
Furjes this very day, Sir.

263
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,037
- It can't be true, my father!
- I am not your father.

264
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,755
It can't be true!

265
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,513
WeII, it is true.

266
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,073
My daughter wiII be given away
by her Majesty the Queen herseIf,

267
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,231
to a husband
befitting her station.

268
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,108
Do you mean you're seIIing your
daughter to the highest bidder?

269
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,594
ShaII I bid for her?

270
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,679
Get out of here!

271
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,590
You shouId be satisfied that
I took you out of the mud.

272
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,989
She's my daughter.

273
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,834
- She is engaged to me! - She
doesn't know even your name now.

274
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,110
You didn't go near her
for one whoIe year!

275
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,351
The door is over there!

276
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,118
I can teII you that Ádám Furjes
wiII have a job to tame you.

277
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,152
He's aIready won haIf the battIe
since I'm marrying him

278
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,549
on your order.

279
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,871
Yes, that is what I wish.

280
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,473
It's time you married.

281
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,430
You mustn't wait another year.

282
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,354
It wouId be best if you stayed.
We'II stay as weII.

283
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,633
WeII, get hoId of some men

284
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,672
and we'II steaI away the bride
this evening.

285
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,230
No.

286
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,076
She wiII make her escape
from the castIe on her own,

287
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,594
if she Ioves me!

288
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,512
She swore to Iove me forever.

289
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,229
Hey boy!

290
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,159
WouId you Iike to earn
a goId piece?

291
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,033
I'd rather earn two, Sir!

292
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,590
Take this ring
up to the Lady Éva Cecey.

293
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,758
- Do you know the Lady Éva?
- Put your trust in me, Sir.

294
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,193
It is good.

295
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,709
You merit the bridaI veiI.

296
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,310
Arise now and dress.

297
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,230
When the bride
has given the answer yes,

298
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,829
they wiII ring
aII the church beIIs.

299
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,514
The church beIIs
are never going to ring out!

300
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,318
She may not have had your ring.

301
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,192
That butcher boy
couId have stoIen it.

302
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,158
She is taking a very Iong time.

303
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,873
Dear husband,
you had better go and see!

304
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,115
Éva!

305
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,389
Éva!

306
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,434
Éva!

307
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,669
Éva!

308
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,588
My daughter
has been kidnapped!

309
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,275
Ring aII the beIIs!

310
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,197
My daughter's abducted.

311
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,952
Let us go, my friends. There is
nothing more to keep us here.

312
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,794
I never want to set eyes
on her again.

313
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,716
- Greetings, nobIe gentIemen.
- Greetings, shepherd.

314
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,310
This sIope is too much for the
horses. We had better Iead them.

315
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,759
Come on, Jancsi.

316
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,868
Stand and deIiver
your money or your Iives!

317
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,196
- It's Éva!
- Éva!

318
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,679
WeII, Jancsi, I think
the horses need some food.

319
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,873
You're right!

320
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,158
GergeIy bornemissza

321
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,635
wiII you take Éva Cecey,
the fugitive

322
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,918
Iady-in-waiting to Queen
IsabeIIa, as your wife?

323
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,313
I wiII!

324
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,910
WiII you swear
faithfuIness untiI death?

325
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,599
I'II swear it.

326
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,992
Come, Éva, we'II spend
the night here in safety.

327
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,878
Remember that other time?

328
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,149
No.

329
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,198
Never mind.

330
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,873
Come here!

331
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,032
We won't harm you.

332
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,999
I hope you know how to write
because you'II have to, now.

333
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,748
I'm from
the monastery at CsiksomIyó.

334
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,235
I've copied many a manuscript.

335
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,272
None of your taIes, monk.

336
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,513
In the summertime,
we take turns to come out here

337
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,230
to give a IittIe spirituaI
comfort to the peasants.

338
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,910
WeII, you're in time
to give some comfort now.

339
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,310
Éva, GergeIy. Where are you?

340
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,109
We've found a priest
here to marry you both.

341
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,030
WeII, am I stiII needed?

342
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,596
Come back here!

343
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,675
Since you're here,
you can marry them.

344
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,952
You'II have to hurry up.

345
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,591
because of a taIisman?

346
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,639
WhiIe I had it on me, no sword
or buIIet couId hurt me,

347
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,316
and now it's out of my possession,
I never cease getting wounded.

348
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,356
It was stoIen and good fortune
has forsaken me since then.

349
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,556
An so you wiII remain
a dervish.

350
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,512
UntiI I find
that magic taIisman again,

351
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,677
I'II do penance for 1001 days.

352
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,269
I traveI the road
between Pécs and Mecca,

353
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,590
weeping and praying
and teIIing my beads,

354
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,075
and caIIing on
the sacred name of AIIah.

355
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,793
AIIah!

356
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,790
Go with AIIah, Effendi.

357
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,715
I'II be gIad
when we find báIint Török.

358
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,354
I'm sick of it.

359
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,239
Today you're my prisonner, but
tomorrow I'II have to be yours.

360
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,268
- Speak Iower, they may hear you.
- No. They're too busy praying.

361
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,919
WeII, get ready to start.

362
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,872
Sir!

363
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,396
Wake up!
Good business is possibIe.

364
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,950
Here are some Hungarians
disguised.

365
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,953
They pretend to be prisoners.

366
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,992
Give me some of your men
to go after them.

367
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,113
Isn't someone watching us there?

368
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,671
- A one-eyed Turk.
- Is every Turk one-eyed for you?

369
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,914
Let's go.

370
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,436
- Jancsi, jump off!
- Why?

371
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,279
They are reaIIy foIIowing us.

372
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,068
Just Iike I toId you.

373
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,596
The pistoIs! Come on!

374
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,679
buIIets for these?

375
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,711
We have no more use of
the horses among the rocks.

376
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,474
Drive them away.

377
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,392
Take the weapons and the goId off.

378
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,789
QuickIy!

379
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,676
No!

380
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,554
Does anyone speak
Hungarian here?

381
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,993
Lead us to the voivode.

382
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,636
To the voivode. Where is he?

383
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,634
Look here!

384
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,831
Look!

385
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,473
What Ianguage do you speak?

386
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,071
In the one I am spoken to.

387
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,078
We are in need of a guide.
We're Hungarians,

388
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,719
making for IstanbuI.

389
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,038
I regret that I cannot offer
to Iet you have a guide.

390
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,958
However, we're wiIIing
to sheIter you for the night.

391
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,117
Are you Hungarians?
I am Hungarian.

392
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,198
How did you get
so far away from home?

393
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,391
Just Iike the other Hungarians.

394
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,272
In that case,
why don't you come with us?

395
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,149
Take your ease!

396
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,672
- WouId you Iike to eat, wanderers?
- To eat and drink

397
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,839
Are you coming wiht us?

398
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,517
To roam around the country.
I'd faII in with even the deviI!

399
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,717
Here is something on account.

400
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,072
You know,
your face Iooks famiIiar.

401
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,874
Not surprising,

402
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,754
everyone mistakes me
for King Ferdinand.

403
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,912
A handsome boy

404
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,630
A boy? That's a girI!

405
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,389
- I am the onIy man here!
- Me too!

406
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,116
I must take my Ieave
according to our custom.

407
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,233
You see, we Gypsies,
spend aII our Iives wandering.

408
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,716
And wanderers have no cemeteries.

409
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,595
Those who go away are no more.

410
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,714
And so we pay to them the Iast
honor as we wouId to the dead.

411
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,955
WeII, here we are
at Iast in IstanbuI.

412
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,115
This is where my father
is being heId prisoner.

413
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,635
My poor master,
for a year and a haIf.

414
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,349
For 514 days.

415
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,116
514 days.

416
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,199
Isn't it 1028?

417
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,959
You have never read
as much as here.

418
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,351
You have recourse to do it.

419
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,668
If there are books
printed in Hungarian.

420
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,356
This bibIe was printed on
the expense of Tamás Nádasdy.

421
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,158
I aIso have a fabIe book
from home.

422
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,837
Written by Gábor Pesty.

423
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,434
How many times did I wish
to see the sea.

424
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,557
And now, here it is.

425
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,228
What to do next?

426
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,633
Look, here's
the governor of the prison,

427
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,513
take a cIoser Iook at him.

428
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,629
Come.

429
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,871
We wiII start it tomorrow,
as we pIanned.

430
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,678
I wiII get the dresses
in the town.

431
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,792
- He has a stupid face.
- Not stupid.

432
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,759
I wouId say cunning.

433
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,755
Tomorrow morning we wiII see.

434
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,871
HonorabIe VeIi bey,
my gracious Lord, pardon us.

435
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,793
- We are ItaIian minstreIs, Sir.
- You know my name?

436
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,996
Everyone knows the nobIe VeIi bey.

437
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,276
And what do those
who know him, want from him?

438
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,239
We have brought you a wonderfuI
gift, and we're asking a favor.

439
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,033
Not here. Come aIong

440
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,953
a IittIe farther off.

441
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,519
We are ItaIian minstreIs.
We were fishing Iast night

442
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,677
by the fortress
We are poor wanderers

443
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,638
and we have to fish at night

444
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,189
onIy, Iast night
we made a miracuIous catch.

445
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,715
As we Iifted the net,
we saw something shining

446
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,270
a magnificer goIden dish!

447
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,518
- A goIden dish?
- Yes, Iook at it.

448
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,479
Did you ever behoId
such a beautifuI dish?

449
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,638
Mas AIIah!

450
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,035
So we were wondering what we
shouId do with it. SeII it

451
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,599
they'd think we were robbers!

452
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,110
And who knows what misfortune
that might have Iet us into?

453
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,158
And what was the good of keeping
it when we have nothing to eat?

454
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,596
Why did you decide
to bring it to me?

455
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,870
Oh, my Lord, that's just
what we're trying to expIain!

456
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,439
WhiIe we were wandering,

457
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,757
we suddenIy remembered that one
of our benefactors, báIint Török,

458
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,272
is being heId prisoner here.
He's a Hungarian nobIeman,

459
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,075
and we thought that perhaps
you'd aIIow us to sing to him!

460
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,313
- So that's why you brought it
to me? - ExactIy!

461
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,999
Wait a moment.

462
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,839
Jussuf!

463
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,714
bring the oId Hungarian
into the garden.

464
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,912
There wiII soon be an escape.

465
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,750
A turban is not aIways Turk.

466
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,799
...here is freedom.

467
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,919
...you can trust us.

468
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,639
From Hungary it was a Iong way.

469
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,750
You wiII be out of this pIace.

470
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,677
ItaIian sounds Iike this.

471
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,318
My Lord, pIease forgive me,

472
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,755
an unIucky creature
that dares address your Grace.

473
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,753
I am a dervish, I have
traveIIed thorougout the worId.

474
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,758
I shouId Iike to warn your Honor

475
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,593
about those minstreIs.

476
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,718
Mistrust them,
they wiII bIackmaiI you.

477
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,870
beware of these men, my Lord!

478
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,432
baIckmaiI? Nonsense!

479
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,712
I ask you onIy if yesterday
you were given a fine goId pIate?

480
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,719
I do not know your name.

481
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,271
My name is
one hundred thousand crowns.

482
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,636
In my opinion,
it is a name with a ring to it!

483
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,512
Provided the name is not faIse!

484
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,716
You may soon see for yourseIf.

485
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,515
Your name
however is that of a poor man.

486
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,757
Everything here
beIongs to the SuItan

487
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,390
aIthough I've no doubt
you're a vaIiant warrior.

488
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,709
That, I admit.

489
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,350
In this enormous fortress,
you're aIso a prisoner.

490
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,359
It is up to you to choose
a better Iife for yourseIf.

491
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,236
And where is the better Iife
you suggest?

492
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,677
It's right here in the fortress!

493
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,196
There are aIso
a weaIthy Hungarian baron here,

494
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,357
caIIed báIint Török.

495
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,310
bring him down
to the beach tomorrow.

496
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,230
but Iet there be
nobody eIse with you!

497
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,359
In this purse are
five hundred ducats

498
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,478
- In advance! - How may
I be sure you may be trusted?

499
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,558
Just Iook at this taIisman

500
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,638
a present from a great Lord.

501
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,594
It brings me Iuck and guarantees
success in my enterprises.

502
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,752
Five hundred ducats.

503
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,755
And the rest?

504
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,399
You wiII get it.

505
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,231
OnIy if báIint Török
is not with you,

506
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,313
my good friends
are IiabIe to become very angry.

507
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,199
I wiII bring him.

508
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,239
Five hundred ducats

509
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,353
You are right,
he can't be an honorabIe man.

510
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,554
A goIden dish. I have never
seen a precious dish as that.

511
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,149
A Hungarian?

512
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,715
No, a Turk.
His taIisman is Turkish.

513
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,309
TaIisman?

514
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,989
That is right. A ring
with a Iarge green stone

515
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,714
and a yeIIow haIf moon
with five stars on it.

516
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,189
What?

517
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,956
A ring with a green stone and
a yeIIow haIf moon on it?

518
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,630
- What's the matter?
- And five stars?

519
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,393
What is the matter with you?

520
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,358
A yeIIow haIf moon?

521
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,989
On a green stone
and five diamond stars!

522
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,235
You hear? Five diamond stars!

523
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,988
Five stars!

524
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,639
Have you gone mad?

525
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,553
I've thought of a scheme,
nobIe bey.

526
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,431
Just assist me
and aII I posses is yours!

527
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,317
I don't understand.
Why are you so happy?

528
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,394
- I have been bIackmaiIed.
- but save you.

529
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,793
- Was he aIone?
- He was.

530
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,550
- In yeIIow turban?
- In yeIIow turban.

531
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,198
Listen to me.
I have a great pIan.

532
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,758
They want báIint Török.

533
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,668
Give him to them.

534
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,434
Here he is!

535
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,392
He's brought him.

536
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,591
They murdered him!
They murdered GergeIy!

537
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,550
- They murdered him!
- GergeIy was dead

538
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,949
but he's risen again.

539
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,236
I paid a poor beggar
to wear my cIothes.

540
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,352
Father oh, father

541
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,513
Where's that one-eyed dervish?
I saw him just a second ago!

542
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,796
It wasn't VeIi bey!
The dervish did it.

543
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,473
The boat! There they are!

544
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,033
Éva!

545
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,911
Watch out, Jancsi!

546
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,430
They'II never come back.

547
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,353
- Never!
- That's right.

548
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,789
but they are aIive.

549
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,635
You see, MikIós. I'd Iike
to find some suitabIe cIothes

550
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,116
to wear at Padua University.

551
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,553
This ought to do.

552
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,918
but there may be
Iots of hoIes in the pockets

553
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,118
because GergeIy puts
aII sorts of rubbush into them.

554
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,549
Éva!

555
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,234
There's somebody
who wants to speak to you.

556
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,756
About a very urgent matter!
Maybe a message from GergeIy.

557
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,351
Madam, I am
your most respectfuI servant.

558
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,551
Tamás baIogh from RévfaIu.

559
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,072
I'm in town for a short
whiIe to make some purchases

560
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,715
and I thought of avaiIing
myseIf of the opportunity

561
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,991
to admire your wonderfuI jeweI.

562
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,873
I have no jeweIs to seII.

563
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,199
The goIdsmith's shop
is down the street.

564
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,278
I've come to the right pIace.

565
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,676
AII over the country, peopIe know

566
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,639
about GergeIy bornemissza's
remarkabIe Turkish taIisman.

567
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,634
May I Iook at it?

568
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,874
I am a great admirer
of the JeweIIer's art.

569
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,714
My husband
does have a Turkish ring,

570
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,797
but he won't show it to anyone.

571
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,594
I'm toId that the ring
has a magic power.

572
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,677
Now that you mention it, it
is rather an interesting ring.

573
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,434
In that case, I suppose
it has speciaI features.

574
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,033
Since you're taIking, I'II take
IittIe Jancsi out for a waIk.

575
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,751
Yes, but don't be
gone Iong, MikIós.

576
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,677
WeII now, wouId you mind
if I took a Iook at that ring?

577
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,673
Very sorry, Mister baIogh,
but you can't see it.

578
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,394
You see my husband
aIways takes it with him!

579
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,995
Than I shaII wait
untiI he returns.

580
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,674
You wouId wait in vain! He
Ieft for the fortress at Eger

581
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,473
on his Majesty's orders.

582
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,239
The fortress of Eger?
And he has the ring on him?

583
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,150
He aIways carries it on him.

584
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,709
Good day, Mister baIogh.

585
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,513
Good day to you Mistress.

586
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,952
Look, honeycomb candy!
buy me some!

587
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,195
One penny.

588
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,114
Here.

589
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,910
Sweetmeats? Just wait, my young
friend, I'II buy you some, too.

590
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,070
I'm getting so forgetfuI
in my time of Iife!

591
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,072
I must have Ieft
my purse at your pIace.

592
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,276
WouId you mind going
back and bringing it to me?

593
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,077
Isn't this your purse?

594
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,110
I toId you I was absent-minded!
There are so many things to see.

595
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,634
Let's take a Iook around.

596
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,232
Save us Lord,
protect us from our enemies.

597
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,911
Jancsi!

598
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,795
Stay with us in times of danger,
now and forever.

599
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,873
Save us from the pagan hordes!

600
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,678
Jancsi!

601
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,994
be our defender. Give us
courage, be our weapon

602
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,238
and our right hand,
now and forever.

603
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,512
Jancsi!

604
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,914
Save us from the Turkish menace.

605
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,953
Let our souIs be strong
with they strenght!

606
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,871
I am to bIame.
I aIone am to bIame.

607
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,358
He'II go to Eger fortress because
I toId him the ring was there.

608
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,918
Isn't it there?

609
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,355
It's here.

610
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,876
I was afraid to show it to him.

611
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,556
Now I must go to Eger.
I've got to.

612
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,319
I'II go with you.

613
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,036
I'm from Eger and I know every
secret way into the fortress.

614
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,590
And we'II get in, no
matter how near the Turks are.

615
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,789
Over there, you!

616
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,718
Is there
a bIacksmith amoung you?

617
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,350
bIacksmith, carpenters,
butchers! Move over this way!

618
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,192
Come on, hurry! Hurry!
You others, over here!

619
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,518
- How many more do you have?
- I have around fifty men.

620
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,239
- Arm them.
- Yes, Sir!

621
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,234
- Are there many women here?
- Quite a number, Sir!

622
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,113
Don't worry, they are going
to make themseIves very usefuI.

623
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,795
Good, then for a start,
you go to the kitchen!

624
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,871
Very weII, Sir. Come on Iadies!

625
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,519
You three, go up there;
and you others, stay here!

626
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,588
- Issue arms to everyone, János.
- Right away, Commander!

627
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,396
AIIright then, jump to it!

628
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,109
Commander Dobó!

629
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,593
Did the reconnaeissance
party get back yet?

630
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,239
We Iost contact
with twenty of the men.

631
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,748
We simpIy couIdnt't find them.

632
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,349
Ahmed's army's marching
toward the VaIIey of the MamseI.

633
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,158
We are 1535!

634
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,838
The men from the six provinces
of North Hungary have swords.

635
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,511
The Kassa men have muskets.

636
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,871
The RoyaI Contingent
aIso have haIbards.

637
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,715
SIaughter cattIes?

638
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,319
We have about 1500.

639
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,874
This is aIso a good weapon.

640
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,351
I can chop that few hundred
Turks with it.

641
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,075
Now, bIacksmiths!

642
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,992
How Iong can we use the swords?

643
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,231
These are good for even a year.

644
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,995
Do you want to brood over
your weapons for a year?

645
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,032
-If I have to.
- And if you don't?

646
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,192
Than I'd go home soon.

647
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,517
Five chiIdren and my wife
are waiting for me.

648
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,835
Stop!

649
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,039
How do you hoId that sword?

650
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,478
You cannot cut a withy Iike this,
not even a Turkish head.

651
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,436
Where is your shieId?

652
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,320
We don't need that.
It just hinders us in moving.

653
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,278
but you can weII use it
on the waIIs.

654
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,068
Practice more.

655
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,191
HaIt!

656
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,795
These twenty men
wiII now act as Turks.

657
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,355
Me too?

658
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,518
- Gunpowder?
- Sufficient!

659
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,229
And where are those deviIish
bombs of yours, Master GergeIy?

660
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,913
I'II put some extra
into these bombs!

661
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,313
OiIy tow, mixed with
IittIe pieces of copper!

662
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,955
Pieces of iron
and pieces of brimstone.

663
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,910
A very crafty device!
It expIodes three times.

664
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,756
The Turks have got nothing
Iike this. It'II sIaughter them.

665
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,029
ShaII we haiI them
with a saIve, Commander?

666
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,313
No, my friend.

667
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,912
I think it's the duty
of the guests to say good morning.

668
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:33,038
It reached us
what we were waiting for.

669
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,559
Don't worry. The bishop of Eger
have promised to pray for us.

670
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,515
And we have 1535 of us,
soIdiers, and some others

671
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,871
That makes 100 short of 2000.

672
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,751
I am counting on
the heIp of the king.

673
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,315
It wiII arrive.

674
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,358
Do you reaIIy beIieve it?

675
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,350
The king knows weII:
if Eger faIIs,

676
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,832
he can put his crown
into the chamber.

677
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,117
If Eger faIIs, neither MiskoIc
nor Kassa can stand.

678
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,150
The Turks shake down the smaIIer
castIes Iike they do with waInuts.

679
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,119
The waIIs are strong.

680
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,590
I trust in peopIe, not in waIIs.

681
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,117
And in the royaI army.

682
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,159
There is our deIegate who
teIIs everything to Ferdinand.

683
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,071
WiII he teII what a mess here is?

684
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,079
Two days ago it was
cIean as a paste-board.

685
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,273
I have onIy a pair of hands.

686
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,756
If the gate was not cIosed,
I wouId Ieave.

687
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,991
God, I wouId reaIIy Ieave.

688
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,109
This Mrs. baIogh
is worse than the Turks.

689
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,629
Your Majesty,

690
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,190
István Dobó, Commander of Eger,
is in desperate straits

691
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,636
and asks for reinforcement.

692
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,713
Let me teII you something:

693
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,112
His Majesty has aIready
sent reinforcement.

694
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,275
He ordered Lieutenant bornemissza
to go there with 150 men.

695
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,311
Moreover, he beIieves that it's
the Hungarian nobiIity's duty

696
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,119
to defend Hungary.

697
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,873
They are rich enough

698
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,271
to take care of their country.

699
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,433
May I ask you, to remind
His Majesty, Ferdinand Hapsburg,

700
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,108
that, among others,
he is the king of Hungary.

701
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,152
To István Dobó, Commander of the
Eger Fortress! Greetings!

702
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,596
I, the Pasah Ahmed of AnatoIia,

703
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,796
Supreme Commander of the
powerfuI and invincibIe SuItan,

704
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,712
announce by voice and Ietter

705
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,473
that the mighty SuItan has
sent his armies into Hungary.

706
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,238
No force on Earth
can resist his might.

707
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,673
by order of the respIendent
SuItan, I exhort you

708
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,109
not to have the audacity
to resist him,

709
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,589
but to Iay down your arms, and
throw open the gates of Eger!

710
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,960
If you do my SuItan's wiII,
no harm wiII befaII you;

711
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,555
you wiII even benefit from
the magnanimity of the Padisah

712
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,351
and rejoice in as much Iiberty
as under your former kings!

713
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,159
This I swear upon my sacred oath!

714
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,991
but if you resist
the nobIe SuItan,

715
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,312
you wiII bring down upon
yourseIves, on your wives

716
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:04,078
and your chiIdren, his aImighty
wrath. You wiII aII die!

717
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,353
The written word!

718
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,158
The SuItan's written word.

719
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,635
He either bargaining
or threatening.

720
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,515
We Hungarians are not afraid
of empty threats,

721
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,392
so there is
no reason to read it.

722
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,632
We shaII never bargain with him,

723
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,070
so there is again
no reason to read it!

724
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,953
Our country
is not for saIe at any price.

725
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,952
SzoInok has faIIen to the Turks,

726
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,719
and Temesvár, too.

727
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,310
This fortress is therefore,
Hungary!

728
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,228
before we take our oath,
another word.

729
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,668
Those who are frightened
may Ieave the fort at once!

730
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,473
I had rather a dozen Iions than
a muItitude of timorous jakaIs.

731
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,629
And secondIy,

732
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,956
there wiII be no
communications with the Turks.

733
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,755
And finaIIy,

734
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,870
death to any weak-Iivered dog
who taIks of surrender!

735
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,759
Take the oath!

736
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,154
I swear by God,
the EternaI Creator,

737
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,438
to offer up my souI,
heart and body

738
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,030
to defend the Fortress of Eger!

739
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,795
Neither force, nor trickery

740
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,918
shaII daunt me!

741
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,157
Neither goId,
nor promises shaII defer me

742
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,312
from my purpose.

743
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,352
I shaII fight or perish!

744
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,992
To this end, heIp me,
AImighty God!

745
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,353
To this and, heIp me,
AImighty God!

746
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,310
Steady men, take over,
behind the ramparts!

747
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,194
Women and chiIdren
to the casemates! Hurry!

748
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,471
Commander, give us the order
to fire the cannons!

749
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,231
- No, save your powder.
- Why won't you Iet us fire back?

750
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,030
- Who are you?
- My name is Adam, the minstreI.

751
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,516
- And your arms?
- This is it.

752
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,315
That is why I was wondering

753
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,477
why you were not firing our guns
at the Turks!

754
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,990
My dear master, Sebestyén
the Scribe, aIways toId me

755
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,359
to write the truth and Iearn the
reason from the best authority.

756
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,391
AII right, you may write
this in your book.

757
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,957
That we are not firing our guns
because it's Sunday today.

758
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,193
How on earth can it be Sunday
when it was Monday this morning?

759
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,795
They are siIent.

760
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,997
They either have no cannons
or no gunpowder.

761
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,395
Forward! Go on!

762
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,316
WaIk cIoser, my IittIe Iambs!

763
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,913
CIoser.

764
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,349
- Are they in range?
- Yes, Commander.

765
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,871
I aIready said, the Turks
aren't used to these things.

766
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,878
WeII, we'II soon see.

767
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,752
I understand, Commander.

768
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,396
When fighting a mighty force,
strategy wiII sway your course.

769
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,309
Wine, give us more wine!

770
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,637
- Guard!
- Enough! János!

771
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,869
beg to report, Commander.
We're ceIebrating!

772
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,997
be just as merry on the waIIs
when the Turks make an attack!

773
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,999
You may go now!

774
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,316
- Take that sword to the smith
tomorrow morning. - Yes, Sir!

775
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,678
How much money
did you make today?

776
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,952
- Quite a tidy sum, Commander!
- How much wiII it amount to

777
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,918
- before the siege is raised?
- WeII, I can't say

778
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,719
If I see a drunken soIdier
inside the fort,

779
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,190
I won't bother to ask where
he got the wine: I'II hang you!

780
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,595
- Sárközi!
- Yes, what is it?

781
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,829
Come with me, if you want to get
yourseIf a horse Iike mine!

782
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,872
- Where do I have to go?
- Against the Turks.

783
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,553
We'II take them by surprise
tonight.

784
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,632
I'm sick of waiting
of this inaction!

785
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,350
I regret, Sir, onIy
I swore on my most soIemn catch

786
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,477
I wouId not Ieave the fort
for any reason.

787
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,154
No, you swore that you'd
defend the Eger fortress.

788
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,915
The others couId have sworn that.

789
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,199
OnIy I swore that
I' wouId not Ieave the fort!

790
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,952
You no-good gipsy beggar,
you good-for nothing!

791
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,233
Good-for-nothing?

792
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,710
AII right, Iet's see!

793
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,074
Wine for me!

794
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,193
Wine for you,
the hanging tree for me. No!

795
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,837
Commander, I toId him
to give me something fine

796
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,957
and he gave me what's fine.

797
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,272
Hungarian
is not an easy Ianguage.

798
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,676
There is what's fine,

799
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,312
and there is a drink caIIed wine.

800
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,239
Sound the reveiIIe!

801
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,193
Sound the reveiIIe!

802
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,354
Sound the reveiIIe!

803
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,552
Why the heII do you have to
wake me up from my best dream.

804
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,996
I was dreaming
about a beautifuI girI.

805
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,033
- There are 20 men under the
waIIs. - It means an attack.

806
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,511
Open the gates! That's my order.

807
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,279
The Turks do not attack
with 20 men.

808
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,953
And if they do, weIcome them.

809
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,116
Don't shoot. I am János Török.

810
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,875
- Lead me to Commander Dobó!
- Jancsi!

811
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,391
Do you have now Turkish dress?

812
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,519
It's not mine, goddamn!

813
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,836
I am wearing it in order
to get through their camp.

814
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,270
- We have Iost boIyki at MakIár.
- boIyki?

815
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,319
You have Iost me? I've Iost you!

816
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,119
Tamás boIyki!

817
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,118
I see you have booties, too.

818
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,638
And a tongue.
He may know something.

819
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,795
Untie him
and bring to the Commander.

820
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,990
Jancsi,
this needs to be bandaged.

821
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,239
- ShouId we sew it?
- Hey, I am not a dress!

822
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,919
Give him some wine!

823
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,278
Commander, Lieutenant Török
brought in a tongue.

824
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,273
Leave him here,
I'II make him taIk.

825
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,274
Come here!

826
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,712
Come here Imre!

827
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,758
Imre Varsányi!

828
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,031
What a Turk you are!

829
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,751
Lieutenant Jancsi's Iot
wiII be soId by auction!

830
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,675
You can start.

831
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,952
A wonderfuI Arab horse.

832
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,998
ReaIIy fabuIous!
For a poor two fIorentines!

833
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,151
We've no need of horses
in a besieged fortress!

834
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,714
Let's see the weapons.

835
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,636
A Damascus steeI saber!

836
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,513
Wait a second. Let's see first
what there is in that chest.

837
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,796
I may want to spend
my money on what's inside.

838
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,237
- Let's see the treasure of Darius.
- I'd Iike to buy a siIver cup.

839
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,796
- What news from Ferdinand?
- OnIy bad news.

840
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,960
I hardIy managed
to make myseIf understood.

841
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,070
For him, this fortress
is just mamare.

842
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,432
This fortress represents Hungary!

843
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,714
If he won't defend it,
we'II defend it ourseIves.

844
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,390
Here, eat some of this,
it's better than piIaf!

845
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,628
The Truks take the fortress
of Eger for a sheep-foId.

846
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,476
They wiII see how
a sheep of Eger can bite.

847
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,796
First day
we shot their best cannons.

848
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,190
They stiII have enough.
I saw it.

849
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,111
I spent four days in their camp
before I found János Török's team.

850
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,558
It was not easy
to have myseIf captured aIive.

851
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,519
Drink, foIIower of the rue faith.

852
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,471
AIIah wiII forgive you.

853
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,232
- Mama, mama!
- What the deviI! A turkish boy.

854
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,439
His mother
must have hidden him there.

855
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,598
- StrangIe him!
- No, take your hands off!

856
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,711
I opened it. He's mine.

857
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,869
KiII the IittIe swine!
KiII him!

858
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,188
No, don't! Don't!
Take your hands off him!

859
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,072
SiIence! Stop that, men!
Leave the boy aIone!

860
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,033
What has he to do
with the fighting?

861
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,073
Take good care of the chiId.

862
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,398
Who knows where his mother is?

863
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,833
I hope your papa
didn't shoot that cannon!

864
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,679
Enough of your waiIing!

865
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,510
Your chiId has vanished? I'II
give you another to repIace him.

866
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,474
Here he is.
Take good care of him.

867
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,718
He's worth more than your Iife.

868
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,516
but if he's disobedient,
beat him soundIy!

869
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,799
That cave doesn't Iead anywhere.

870
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,197
We onIy want to rest in the cooI.
We've had a Iong journey.

871
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,749
AIright then Take your ease!

872
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,719
GergeIy bornemissza!

873
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,952
Lieutenant of the King!

874
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,274
Listen to me!

875
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,756
You have a Turkish taIisman,

876
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,038
and I have a Hungarian boy.

877
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,233
That taIisman is mine,

878
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,238
this chiId is yours!

879
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,595
If you want your son back,
come to the market gate!

880
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,078
Give me my taIisman

881
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,396
and you wiII have your boy again!

882
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,190
Can you hear me?
GergeIy bornemissza?

883
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,835
If you don't beIieve
what I'm saying

884
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,713
you'II see it's the truth

885
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,197
when I throw your son's head
over the waIIs of the fortress!

886
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,233
Do you hear, GergeIy bornemissza?

887
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:20,196
Why do they spend their time
shouting fooIish words every night?

888
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,159
Answer me!

889
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,637
If they don't decide to attack, it
wiII drag on for weeks and weeks.

890
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,313
Even months.

891
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,913
The eighty day!

892
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,876
Since the beginning of the siege
we've been battering the waIIs.

893
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,309
The damage is at its most here.

894
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,793
Dobó has concentrated
his good men there.

895
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,435
- The thing to decide is
- Who wiII Iead the storming party?

896
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,912
The question is, at which point
do they Ieast expect the attack

897
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,719
to come from?

898
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,238
I'II teII you which point.

899
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:09,317
Not one cannon baII has hit here.

900
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,719
Let me see.

901
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,797
On the eve
of the crescent moon festivaI,

902
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,756
we'II attack! We shaII
feight a retreat and then

903
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,879
Everyone to the waIIs! They're
attacking on the southern side!

904
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,714
Lie fIat!

905
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,475
Up!

906
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,109
It needs time to refiII the cannons.

907
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,118
Men, foIIow me!

908
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,192
Come on, men, quickIy.
Go on!

909
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,238
- The Truks attack under sheIter.
- Goddamn!

910
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:47,229
It's not raining out there.

911
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,953
It's so quiet.

912
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,673
They're not moving!

913
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,669
They're out of range
of our cannons.

914
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,276
The gunners aren't moving either.

915
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,394
What does it mean?

916
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,472
That they're going to retreat?

917
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,994
The Grand Vizier Ahmed
is a crafty man.

918
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,313
We'II wait.

919
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:03,910
There wiII be
no song written about us.

920
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,673
For our wives happiness.

921
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,236
An aIive husband is better
than a dead one.

922
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,673
What a fooI I am!

923
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,916
Turn the cannons
to face the oId gate.

924
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,358
That's why they were so quiet.

925
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,308
OnIy two cannons.

926
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,199
Whatch the main body, because
they may attack from the front!

927
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,278
This way Hungarians!

928
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,713
Shoot here! Shoot!

929
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,399
Fire!

930
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,873
Fire!

931
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,430
With painfuI hearts in Hungary
can we say the Iament

932
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,912
what Jeremiah wrote
about the Jews.

933
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,475
For our heritage
is handed down to the heathen,

934
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:16,874
our home is going to be
that of a stranger.

935
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,792
We are dispersed
by the heathen Turks,

936
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,556
we are hounded out
from our homeIand.

937
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:36,718
Commander

938
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:47,918
We didn't agree to this!

939
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,036
SpiIIing the bIood of our feIIows!

940
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,551
And bombarding our own fortress?

941
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,034
The men are beganning to grouse,

942
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,118
they want to receive
their siege pay.

943
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:05,839
It's the Iaw of battIe.

944
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,072
I know,

945
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,718
Lieutenant Hegedũs.

946
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,989
Varsányi,

947
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,759
Hegedũs has gone away with
some men in that direction.

948
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,509
I've been watching him!

949
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,438
He caIIed me a rotten gipsy.

950
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,518
WeII, the rotten gipsy
has a good pair of eyes!

951
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:16,478
Our Lady heIp us!
It is our Iast hope.

952
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,196
That secret passage is either
around here, or nowhere.

953
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:27,428
It's here!
The HoIy Virgin heard us!

954
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,069
You see if we can get through.

955
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,715
They're trying
to desert to the turkish side.

956
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,479
We'd better foIIow them!

957
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,029
No, not me!

958
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,993
I swore on oath
I wouIdn't Ieave the fortress.

959
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,837
Return to the Commander then,
and I'II go after them.

960
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,829
Who is it?

961
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,069
It's me.

962
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,273
- Who is that ''me''?
- It's me, Commander!

963
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:19,789
Come in.

964
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,278
betrayaI! Lieutenant
Hegedũs found a way

965
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,516
to the Turks with ten of his men.

966
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,158
Éva, are you strong enough
to go on?

967
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,797
Just Iet me get my breath
a moment. We've got to go on!

968
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,271
At Ieast you can Iet me
heIp you carry the bag!

969
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,232
No, the bag is empty.

970
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,512
Except for the taIisman.

971
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,670
You are so kind MikIós.
Thank you. Let's start again.

972
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,398
I have fired at my own men.

973
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,878
One of my Iieutenants
is a traitor.

974
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,719
Thousands of Turks
are attacking the fortress.

975
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,279
WiII you stand firmIy?

976
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,313
We are aII behind you!

977
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,479
Even to death it necessary!

978
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:10,998
We've got to hoId on!

979
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:15,274
A Iarge force Iike theirs
wiII soon run out of suppIies.

980
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,628
- Our gownpowder?
- We've got pIenty stiII.

981
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:21,036
- The men?
- Hegedũs is the onIy traitor.

982
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,311
Those who took with him
were ten in number.

983
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,473
We're one thousand
five hundred. And the Turks?

984
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,074
Vast as the sea.

985
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:32,520
We're not afraid
of the sea! We saw it

986
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,718
and we saiIed across it.
We conquered it.

987
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,598
Right, Mekcsey?

988
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,630
Therefore,
and upon carefuI refIection,

989
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,070
and in anguish
for the men in the fortress,

990
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,396
I've Ieft my soIdiers outside
to return unarmed with

991
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:54,474
twenty Turkish soIdiers to hoist
the Padisah's fIag at dawn.

992
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:58,436
Peace be with us! István Hegedũs,
his Majesty's Lieutenant.

993
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,393
- WeII? - SubIime Highness,
they are on their way!

994
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,835
The ten men are
in our hands as hostages.

995
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,514
The Hungarian Lieutenant
is in charge of our soIdiers.

996
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,311
Here they are!
but the men with him are Turks,

997
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,278
being Ied in by Hegedũs!

998
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,398
Then we wiII capture them aIive.

999
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,029
Wait for it.

1000
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,119
AIIright, puII!

1001
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,869
Surround the net, men!

1002
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,718
Want one of them
to heIp you in the kitchen?

1003
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,712
What, a Turk?
Give them to the dogs!

1004
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,428
- There's a Hungarian among them.
- May I ask you pIease,

1005
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,999
exactIy how many you have caught?

1006
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,994
They're aII there Iike fish in
a net. Count them for youseIf.

1007
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,233
As for that secret passage,
bIow it up

1008
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,511
so that nobody eIse
can come through.

1009
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,234
- Where are you going, Gypsy?
- To bIow it up.

1010
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,593
We must be near now.

1011
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,158
Here are the observer-drums.

1012
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,877
but why aren't these watched?

1013
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,189
That shouId do it!

1014
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:04,159
That shouId stop anybody eIse
from coming through there.

1015
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:13,155
They went down there!

1016
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:16,278
They wanted to rest, they said.
but they dindn't come out again.

1017
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,673
István Hegedũs,

1018
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,353
you are a traitor to your
country and your comrades.

1019
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,709
You tried to destroy
the peopIe in their fortress.

1020
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,119
This is your sentence.

1021
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,509
You die!

1022
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:19,231
Come on!

1023
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:37,435
There he is! After him!

1024
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,238
That's aII Ieft in the ceIIar.

1025
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,989
It is more than nothing.

1026
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,673
We shoot these away
in three days.

1027
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,757
These are not for shooting away.

1028
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,510
What kind of startegy
is in your mind now?

1029
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:41,951
Commander, I ask you one thing:

1030
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,872
Let me decide
what to do with these,

1031
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:45,832
since it's not enough
for the cannons.

1032
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,275
I have some more bombs,
but that's aII.

1033
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,553
AII right, GergeIy.

1034
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,470
How many wine-casks do we have?

1035
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,313
Empty? OnIy few.

1036
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:58,279
- but we have 50 fuII of wine.
- Hey, don't touch my wine!

1037
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,235
Pour the wine into tubs
and bring the casks here.

1038
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,475
I cannot do that.

1039
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:05,274
Do as you were toId
and empty those casks.

1040
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:07,755
What the heII
of a machine is this?

1041
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,071
The wheeI
of an oId gunpowder-miII.

1042
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,311
- At Ieast it was once.
- What are you using this for?

1043
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:13,915
I am trying something.

1044
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,316
Try everything.
but the worst is yet to come.

1045
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:19,399
- Commander, can I now...
- What the heII?

1046
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:21,790
I'd Iike to read it.
I'm ready with 12 cantos.

1047
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,028
GergeIy was working indostrousIy,

1048
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,874
He asked for cask-wheeIs hastiIy.

1049
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,276
Covered the spokes with boards...

1050
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,072
I don't know what happened,

1051
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,355
but this is aII
that remains of a brave man

1052
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:33,476
and this Turkish taIisman
ring here.

1053
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,634
So, that Turk was teIIing
the truth the other night.

1054
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:39,951
What night?

1055
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,599
CaII for Varsányi.

1056
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:03,033
Keep this!

1057
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,638
but don't show yourseIf.

1058
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,312
It might upset our best man
we have, at this criticaI moment.

1059
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:17,033
I certanIy don't want
to upset anybody. I just

1060
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,238
I'II do whatever I can for you.

1061
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,312
I'd Iike to give you some
news about him, but it cannot be.

1062
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,999
You've got to trust me.

1063
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,076
GergeIy mustn't be toId
that you are here.

1064
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:30,879
I won't Iet him know I'm here.

1065
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:32,589
On your oath?

1066
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,072
I swear I'II stay away.

1067
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,032
I'm certain that tomorrow
the tempest wiII break upon us!

1068
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:48,029
And onIy Iast night my hen
woke me up by crowing!

1069
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,678
- It's an eviI omen.
- It must have been a rooster!

1070
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,433
No, Commander,
it was my favorite hen.

1071
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:56,234
If it reaIIy is a hen, just
put her in the pot for me!

1072
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,954
Mrs. baIogh,

1073
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:05,030
remember, what you overheard is
a miIitary secret. Understand?

1074
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,151
And try to find something
for this woman to wear.

1075
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:09,515
Come on!

1076
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,992
A woman? Why she's
as thin as a scarecrow!

1077
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:26,513
Commander!

1078
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:32,115
Tonight you've got to get
into the Turk's encapment.

1079
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,319
You'II take a message.

1080
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:36,955
I want you to go and find
that one-eyed dervish man!

1081
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:38,958
This is what you've got to say:

1082
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:41,476
that in the fortress
we have a turkish boy

1083
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:43,996
and we aIso have
a Turkish taIisman.

1084
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:47,916
If he caIIs upon us tonight and
has the Hungarian boy with him

1085
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,152
I wiII give him both in exchange.

1086
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,437
TeII him he
has the word of Dobó István.

1087
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:54,593
I wiII do my best.

1088
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,393
István Dobó!

1089
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,232
Can you hear me?

1090
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:10,199
Listen,
you Hungarians Iisten to me!

1091
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:15,559
Hoist the white fIag, or tomorrow
you wiII aII be dead.

1092
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,231
Can you hear me, Dobó István?

1093
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,911
Prepare to meet your Maker!

1094
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,950
Tomorrow you wiII aII die!

1095
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:27,038
They're praying
before the attack

1096
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:28,993
onIy not for us!

1097
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,552
You're aII dressed up, Sárközi.

1098
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:40,639
That's a fine coIIar, GergeIy.

1099
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,798
A present from my wife.

1100
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:49,714
From the festive dress
you're aII wearing,

1101
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,073
I imagine you've reaIized

1102
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,951
that the cruciaI moment
is upon us.

1103
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:08,919
The Turks
have unfurIed the bIack fIag.

1104
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,555
According to their custom,
that means

1105
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,430
that aII of us
are going to be massacred.

1106
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:23,556
And if we are to die
in the fieId of battIe,

1107
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,149
Iet us meet death
Iike true heroes.

1108
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:32,233
And our gIory
shaII go down in history.

1109
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,592
Make ready!

1110
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,791
Steady, men,
here comes the gouIash!

1111
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:38,309
I hope it's hot enough!

1112
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:41,439
The Turks are going to
enjoy this. Come on!

1113
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,510
GergeIy! GergeIy!

1114
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,349
I'm coming, GergeIy!

1115
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:52,469
Take him over
to my room at once!

1116
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:15,078
Go and teII the Commander
that Jancsi is dead

1117
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,712
Wine! Wine!

1118
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,353
Give wine to the men!

1119
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:29,073
AIIright,
chiId Ieave it aIone now!

1120
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,791
Women, women, pIease stop!

1121
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:38,038
The commander said he'd have
me hanged if I soId any wine.

1122
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:40,709
And if the Commander says
something, he'II do it!

1123
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:44,473
FiII up a cup for me,
I am getting thirsty.

1124
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:46,153
You have too good time, gypsy.

1125
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,152
Others are bIeeding outside
whiIe you are Iazing around here.

1126
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:49,913
You wiII once
put my hands in goId

1127
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:51,878
and aIso the genius
of Lieutenant bornemissza!

1128
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,035
Wait!

1129
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:00,195
Take it!

1130
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:11,391
I never drink whiIe I'm writing!

1131
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:14,549
Get that gun in position!

1132
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:17,596
Hurry, GergeIy! Get them fooI!

1133
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,512
Thank you Jancsi!
Now get out of here!

1134
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:32,673
Youmourdjac!

1135
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,309
Youmourdjac!

1136
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:47,395
Youmourdjac! Where's my son?

1137
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:22,831
GergeIy! Now's the moment,
reIease the wheeI!

1138
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:25,190
Light the wheeI! Let it run!

1139
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:07,159
It's a girI

1140
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:15,708
It's Éva.

1141
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:28,228
GergeIy! GergeIy!

1142
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:33,517
- Come! - Why?
- Don't argue Come!

1143
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:41,189
Éva Éva!

1144
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:44,233
I mustn't speak to you, I
mustn't even say a word to you

1145
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:48,075
I swore.

1146
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:05,271
And finaIIy,
the Turks went away.

1147
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,957
I'm not up to there yet.

1148
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:19,476
GergeIy!
They're bringing your son!

1149
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,355
Watch out, the Turks are coming!

1150
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:30,278
Are you even going to wear
a dress again?

1151
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:42,829
Who's coming with me
to water the horses?
