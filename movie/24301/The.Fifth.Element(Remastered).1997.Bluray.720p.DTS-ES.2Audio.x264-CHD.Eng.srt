1
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,901
Come, come!

2
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:58,969
Please!

3
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,229
Aziz, light!

4
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:23,835
Aziz...

5
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,003
light.

6
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,439
Good.

7
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,631
We start again.

8
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,112
"When the three planets
are in eclipse...

9
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,581
the black hole,
like a door, is open.

10
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,480
Evil comes...

11
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,745
spreading terror and chaos."

12
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:44,411
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

13
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,517
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I' ve got your snakes.

14
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,595
I got all the snakes.

15
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,624
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

16
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,261
If this is the five...

17
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,559
and this is the one...

18
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,133
every 5,000 years.

19
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:07,737
So, I' ve got some time then.

20
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,048
You bring them water.

21
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,550
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.

22
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,560
Go with God.
Be safe from evil

23
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:28,126
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

24
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,259
gathering the four elements
of life...

25
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:33,302
water, fire, earth, air...

26
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,370
around a fifth one.

27
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,840
Afifth...

28
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,970
element.

29
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,175
Forgive me, Lord.

30
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,317
They already know
too much.

31
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:52,121
Father.

32
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:53,719
How are you?

33
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,953
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

34
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:59,997
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

35
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,565
It's the greatest find
in history.

36
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,066
You must be parched.

37
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,066
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,573
It's like a battle plan.

39
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,300
Here the good.

40
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:14,709
Here the evil

41
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,139
And here, a weapon...

42
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,374
against evil

43
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,211
I'm going
to be famous.

44
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:26,315
Then let us toast
to your fame.

45
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,821
To fame.

46
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,687
Salute.

47
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,533
You can't toast
with water.

48
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,899
Billy, in my sack,
the grappa.

49
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,446
This I don't understand.

50
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,085
This could be something...

51
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,383
prehistoric.

52
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,888
I don't know.

53
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,923
But, wait.

54
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:02,624
Here.

55
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,931
Look, look.

56
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,439
They're here.

57
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,589
This man...

58
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,216
this perfect being.

59
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,854
I know this is the key.
I know it.

60
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,295
This divine light
they talk about.

61
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,472
What is divine light?

62
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:50,169
Aziz, light!

63
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,111
Much better.
Thank you.

64
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,253
My Lord.

65
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,509
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I' ve ever seen.

66
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,872
Don't you think?

67
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,675
Are you German?

68
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:10,846
Lord...

69
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,024
I know he was about
to discover everything.

70
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,317
But, no worry.

71
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:16,322
I was there in time.

72
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:17,754
Priest...

73
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,590
you and those before you...

74
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,733
have served us well.

75
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,129
But war is coming.

76
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:27,396
Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

77
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,248
This...

78
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,457
is really amazing.

79
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,625
The fifth element.

80
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,463
Take the stones.

81
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,304
My Lord...

82
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,738
if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenseless...

83
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,170
when evil returns.

84
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,503
In 300 years...

85
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,909
when evil returns...

86
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,049
so shall we.

87
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:27,516
Oh, Professor.

88
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,160
Professor.

89
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,198
Don't move!

90
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,461
I have a gun!

91
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:44,042
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

92
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,302
Friends?

93
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,005
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!

94
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:50,672
I'll explain everything.

95
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,448
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

96
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:54,815
I am your friend.

97
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:57,377
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

98
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,318
Please, put...

99
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,618
the gun down.

100
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:04,919
Billy, no!

101
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:12,403
Hurry!

102
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,798
The wall is closing!

103
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,803
Here is your mission:

104
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,101
Pass your knowledge
to the next priest...

105
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,837
as it was passed to you.

106
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,810
I will do as
you command, but...

107
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,811
hurry, you still
have time.

108
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,745
Time not important.

109
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,407
Only life...

110
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,611
important.

111
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,735
I will fulfill
my mission!

112
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,426
You can count on me!

113
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:53,108
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

114
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,397
Anything yet?

115
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,806
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.

116
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:28,468
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5,000.

117
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,681
Let's see it.

118
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,956
It's taking shape.

119
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,210
Send out a probe.

120
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,187
Ladies and gentlemen...

121
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:15,522
the President of
the Federated Territories.

122
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,957
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

123
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:30,133
I saved this seat
for you, Father.

124
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,609
President on the line.

125
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,007
We're in position.

126
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,206
I have to address the Supreme Council
Just the facts.

127
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,884
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

128
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:42,783
All the calibers are overshot.

129
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:44,685
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.

130
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:47,654
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

131
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,320
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

132
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,394
Recommendation?

133
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,589
My philosophy is:
Shoot first and ask questions later.

134
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,234
I don't like uninvited guests.

135
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,530
All right, then.

136
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,727
Mr. President?

137
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,903
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.

138
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,902
I...

139
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,741
have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

140
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,683
You have 20 seconds.

141
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,954
Imagine that this...

142
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,223
thing is not anything
that can be identified...

143
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,626
because it prefers not to be.

144
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,432
Wherever there is life...

145
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,601
it brings death...

146
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:33,736
Absolute evil

147
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,429
One more reason
to shoot first.

148
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,268
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

149
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,944
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

150
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,516
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

151
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,884
Growth rate is at 27%.

152
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,993
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time to go into it.

153
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,620
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

154
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:03,300
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

155
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:06,462
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

156
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,232
You may fire when ready.

157
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,605
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

158
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,550
Its structure solidified
on the surface.

159
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:23,313
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

160
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,852
The most...

161
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:27,583
terrible intelligence imaginable.

162
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,754
120's loaded.

163
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,591
The ship is
in combat formation.

164
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,699
Missiles are loaded.

165
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:37,994
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,670
I have a doubt.

167
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:41,801
I don't, Mr. President.

168
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,718
What happened?
Can you hear me?

169
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,622
What happened?

170
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,347
- Did you destroy it?
- I' m about to.

171
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,995
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

172
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,634
It's moving toward the ship.

173
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,240
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

174
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,741
Nothing, sir.

175
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,639
Staedert, do you hear me?

176
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,345
Get out of there.

177
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,744
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

178
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,047
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?

179
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,224
Do you understand?
Listen.

180
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,020
That's an order.

181
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,361
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?

182
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,525
Get out of there!

183
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,567
Good God!

184
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,555
Four a day.

185
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,506
I'm tryir

186
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,175
To quit is my goal

187
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,183
I'm up.

188
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,311
All right, I' m up.

189
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:38,750
God.

190
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,826
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.

191
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:45,863
Hi, sweetie.

192
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,226
I love you too.

193
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:48,959
You haven't called me that
since basic training.

194
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,094
I was talking
to the cat.

195
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,794
I forgot...

196
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,431
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.

197
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,097
At least the cat
comes back.

198
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,435
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?

199
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,976
There's millions
out there.

200
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,638
I don't want
a million.

201
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,775
I just want one.

202
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,983
The perfect one.

203
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,779
It don't exist, Major.

204
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,818
Yeah, I know.

205
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:12,790
What?

206
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,858
Picture of you.

207
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,492
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

208
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,094
Must be an old picture.

209
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,388
Bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul

210
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,860
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.

211
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,200
I don't need one.

212
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,462
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.

213
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,301
Finger, I drive
a cab now...

214
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,135
not a space fighter.

215
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:36,040
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?

216
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,374
Major, how many points?

217
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,016
At least 50.

218
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,576
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.

219
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,052
See you tonight.

220
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,259
Welcome to Paradise.

221
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,090
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.

222
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,167
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...

223
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,564
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!

224
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,070
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.

225
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,836
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.

226
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,069
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

227
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,610
For a perfect world.

228
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:16,579
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

229
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,179
Long enough.
Give me the cash.

230
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,085
Is that a Z-140?

231
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,520
Alleviated titanium.

232
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,126
Neurocharged assault model

233
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,365
Good thing for me
it's not loaded.

234
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,798
It's not loaded?

235
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,467
You have to...

236
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,531
push that yellow button
to load it.

237
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,868
Take your time.

238
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,243
Want me to...

239
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:49,985
There you go.

240
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,123
Give me the cash!

241
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,094
That's a very
dangerous gun.

242
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,393
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

243
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,370
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?

244
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:09,600
No. Take it.
I don't need it.

245
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,480
That's a nice hat.

246
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,047
You like it?

247
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:19,943
God!

248
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,786
Please enter your license.

249
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,985
Yes, just a minute.

250
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:32,896
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.

251
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,359
Good morning.

252
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,000
Sleep well? Me too.

253
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,026
I had a horrible nightmare.

254
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,237
Propulsion 2-X-4.

255
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,205
You have five points left
on your license.

256
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,880
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

257
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,180
Have a nice day.

258
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:55,546
Why not?

259
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,426
You have 48 hours.

260
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,566
That's the time it needs to adapt
itself to our living conditions.

261
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,701
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

262
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:14,371
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

263
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,901
but to exterminate life.

264
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,608
All forms of life.

265
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,679
You're telling me
there's nothing that can stop this.

266
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,211
There is only one thing.

267
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:33,752
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil

268
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,926
Four elements...

269
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,495
gathered around a fifth...

270
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,458
supreme being,
the ultimate warrior...

271
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,498
created to protect life.

272
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,695
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."

273
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:49,967
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

274
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,701
But, if...

275
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,969
evil stands there...

276
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,774
Then what?

277
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,243
Then light turns to dark.

278
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:01,884
Life to death...

279
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:03,312
forever.

280
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:10,594
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

281
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,531
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

282
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,634
Thank you.

283
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,832
Permission to enter granted.

284
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,110
Show time.

285
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,263
We are lost.

286
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:24,228
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

287
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,568
Mr. Zorg's office.

288
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,969
It's Aknot.

289
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,573
I'm so glad
to hear you, Aknot.

290
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,280
The mission is accomplished.

291
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,810
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.

292
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,654
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.

293
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,388
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

294
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,086
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

295
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:53,229
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

296
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,863
Three hundred years
of waiting for nothing.

297
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,092
Go get some rest.

298
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,528
No.

299
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,663
The Mondoshawan...

300
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,534
I am their contact.

301
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,142
They will come for me.

302
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,904
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

303
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,374
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

304
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:15,950
Any survivors?

305
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,485
Only one.

306
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,215
You call that a survivor?

307
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,521
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

308
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,096
Have you identified it?

309
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,697
The computer went
off the charts.

310
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,732
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

311
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,462
which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

312
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,607
This has 200,000 memo groups.

313
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,612
Sounds like
a freak of nature.

314
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,814
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

315
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,290
You okay?
Over here.

316
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,594
Excuse me.

317
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,068
General, I want
to show you something.

318
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,571
This is a normal
human DNA chain.

319
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,733
You, me, anybody, right?

320
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,307
Watch this.

321
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:16,608
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

322
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,012
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

323
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,914
Almost like this being
was engineered.

324
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,391
Is there any danger?

325
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,584
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

326
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,754
The cell is,
for lack of a better word...

327
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:34,795
perfect.

328
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,035
Go ahead.

329
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,928
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

330
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,196
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.

331
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:44,038
Activate it.

332
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,905
Tissue processing.

333
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:33,647
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

334
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,258
This is the last phase.

335
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:45,561
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

336
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,236
That means
growing skin.

337
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:48,768
Wonderful

338
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,475
Reconstruction complete.

339
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,376
Remove the shield.

340
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,285
I told you.
Perfect.

341
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,033
Thermal bandages.

342
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,943
I'd...

343
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,781
like to take
a few pictures...

344
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:33,148
for the archives.

345
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,343
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

346
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,005
Activate the phonic detector.

347
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:51,854
Is that thing solid?

348
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,530
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

349
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:05,141
If you want out...

350
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,206
you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

351
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:28,595
General alert.

352
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:56,725
Perfect.

353
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,996
Ladder on 18.

354
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:06,302
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

355
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:26,681
This way.

356
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,990
Lady, stay calm.

357
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:05,685
This is the police.

358
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,993
There's nowhere
else to go.

359
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:12,124
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

360
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,870
Do you understand?

361
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,639
She doesn't.

362
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,159
I think we need
a flying unit.

363
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:48,561
This is the police.

364
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:51,036
This is the police.

365
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,912
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.

366
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,252
She has no file.

367
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,869
She dove off.

368
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:34,283
You just had an accident.

369
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,454
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

370
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,253
You have one point left
on your license.

371
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:42,917
Look out!

372
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,324
Left!

373
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,933
I can't believe it.
Shit.

374
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,241
Any survivors?

375
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,248
Hi.

376
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,077
Are you okay?

377
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:38,913
Boom.

378
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,551
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."

379
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:45,655
Big.

380
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:47,323
Big bada boom.

381
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,317
Bada big boom.

382
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:51,858
Big boom.

383
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,428
Yeah, big bada boom.

384
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:54,723
Bada boom.

385
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,366
Big boom.
Big bada boom.

386
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,065
You're lucky you're not dead.

387
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,835
This is a police control

388
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,840
Please keep your hands
on the wheel

389
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,017
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.

390
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,118
We are going
to arrest her.

391
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:17,913
Thank you for cooperating.

392
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,555
Sorry, honey.

393
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:21,623
Looks like
this is your ride.

394
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:22,817
Open the door.

395
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:26,961
Do what they say.

396
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,259
Sorry.

397
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,049
"Please...

398
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:57,293
help."

399
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:59,121
I only have one point
left on my license.

400
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:03,029
I need it to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul

401
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,560
You understand?

402
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,837
Can you please
open the passenger door?

403
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,900
Please...

404
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,345
help.

405
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,482
I can't.

406
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,619
I repeat...

407
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,385
open the passenger door.

408
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,289
Yeah, yeah, sure.

409
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,792
Why not?

410
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,637
Thank you
for your cooperation.

411
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,212
Help.

412
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,652
Finger's going
to kill me.

413
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,286
Emergency!
Emergency!

414
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,123
One point has
been removed.

415
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,398
Yes, I know!

416
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:16,503
This is so stupid.

417
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:20,036
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.

418
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,212
Unit 47,
we're on the way...

419
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:23,709
after we finish lunch.

420
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,618
Two golden menus.

421
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,384
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

422
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,818
Thank you so much.

423
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:43,729
And I' m definitely
too thirsty.

424
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:46,060
Look out!

425
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,841
We got lucky.

426
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,701
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

427
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:04,317
Maybe two miles.

428
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,623
Hang on.

429
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:16,666
Look, lady...

430
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,530
I only speak English
and bad English!

431
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:22,939
Run an I.D.

432
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:29,873
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

433
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,246
He's got a scan blocker.

434
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,113
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.

435
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:42,152
I don't know
what you did...

436
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:45,927
but they are pissed off!

437
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:46,996
Hold on!

438
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,345
We're safe for a while.

439
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:33,665
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

440
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,311
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

441
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:50,057
If we get to the fog,
we'll be okay.

442
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,187
If we make the fog.

443
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,184
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

444
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:24,683
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down if you don't mind.

445
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:39,700
Shit.

446
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,450
You okay?

447
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,650
Priest.

448
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:56,419
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

449
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,820
Vito Cornelius.

450
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,030
What?

451
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,025
Priest.

452
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,337
Yes?

453
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,204
I'm looking
for a priest.

454
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:13,070
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.

455
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,482
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.

456
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,551
The phone book
said he lived here.

457
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,712
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

458
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:27,515
Nobody does.
No file, no I.D., nothing.

459
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,716
She's got a tattoo
on this arm.

460
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:32,588
Tattoo?

461
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:43,905
Fifth...

462
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:45,568
element.

463
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,909
Finger's going
to kill me.

464
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:55,678
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

465
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,252
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

466
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,787
She just dropped in on me.

467
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,426
Started speaking
a bizarre language.

468
00:41:04,594 --> 00:41:06,960
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

469
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,927
It's the ancient language...

470
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,162
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

471
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,102
He's a she.

472
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,605
You noticed that.

473
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:18,804
Yes.

474
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,445
- It 's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

475
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,381
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

476
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,285
But gently,
because this woman is...

477
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,788
mankind's most precious possession.

478
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:35,584
She is perfect.

479
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:41,660
Perfect.

480
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,003
More dignified.

481
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:51,700
Hey, lady...

482
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,173
wake up.

483
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,280
I shouldn't
have done that.

484
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,788
It was wrong
to kiss you.

485
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,586
He said
to wake you gently.

486
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,227
You're right.

487
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,633
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

488
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,361
Remember?

489
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:20,603
"Bada boom?"

490
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,297
"Big bada boom?"

491
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,369
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

492
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:29,010
I drive a cab.
This is me.

493
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,770
Korben Dallas.

494
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,182
Korben.
You understand?

495
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,684
Here.

496
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,852
Take it.

497
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:38,880
You can call me
when you learn English.

498
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:43,858
Just kidding.

499
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,796
What is your name?

500
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,530
You.

501
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,224
Korben.

502
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,866
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

503
00:42:59,009 --> 00:42:59,976
Good.

504
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,970
All that's your name?

505
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:04,881
Do you have...

506
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,245
a shorter name?

507
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,516
Short.

508
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:15,885
Korben Dallas.

509
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:20,357
Leeloo.

510
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,658
Leeloo.

511
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,235
Korben, Leeloo.

512
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,162
Leeloo, Korben.

513
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,956
You're sure
she's a Supreme Being?

514
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:49,751
Absolutely sure.

515
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,427
Old friends.

516
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:53,857
Yeah, you're right.

517
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,858
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

518
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,393
Korben Dallas.

519
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,399
Thank you for your help.

520
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,438
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

521
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:06,570
She's been on
a long trip.

522
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,940
I know.
I was there when she landed.

523
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,471
Wait, wait, Father.

524
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:15,149
She said something
I didn't understand.

525
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:16,649
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?

526
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:19,121
"Never without my permission."

527
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,313
That's what I thought.

528
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,327
I shouldn't have
kissed her.

529
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:40,504
Oh, no. I' m so sorry.
I forgot your food.

530
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,478
How about some
nice Thai food?

531
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,582
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

532
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:49,183
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.

533
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,078
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?

534
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,186
Car's running fine.

535
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,085
Fine. What "fine"?

536
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,123
I know you.
"Fine"ain't in your vocabulary.

537
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,592
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.

538
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,061
What? You save the planet?

539
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:06,800
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?

540
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:10,639
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

541
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,935
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

542
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,042
How big?

543
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,284
Five-nine...

544
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,118
blue eyes...

545
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,292
long legs, great skin.

546
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,389
You know?
Perfect.

547
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,196
I see.

548
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:38,231
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?

549
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,864
Leeloo.

550
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,640
What's she doing?

551
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:53,816
Learning our history,
the last 5,000 years that she missed.

552
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,644
She's been asleep
for a while.

553
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:11,061
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

554
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,327
You're right.

555
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:16,270
Chicken.

556
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,667
Good.

557
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,578
Chicken.

558
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,716
I'm really sorry
to interrupt you, but...

559
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:32,286
the case...

560
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,347
with the stones...

561
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:36,592
where is it?

562
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:40,226
Stolen?

563
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,461
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

564
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,464
Excuse me, sir.

565
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:53,667
The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

566
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,472
Is it possible
to fire 500,000?

567
00:46:56,646 --> 00:47:01,083
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

568
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,082
Fire one million.

569
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,278
But 500,000...

570
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,458
One million.

571
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,725
Sorry to have
disturbed you.

572
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:27,842
It's for the Supreme...

573
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:31,239
Sorry.

574
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,642
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

575
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,587
You just put it like that.

576
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:42,083
Yes, there was
a man with a limp...

577
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,919
came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

578
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,596
Said he was an art dealer.

579
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:52,328
What was his name?

580
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,999
I'm bad with names.

581
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,770
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.

582
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,611
What'd she say?

583
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:15,724
She says she knows
exactly where they are.

584
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:23,163
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

585
00:48:24,033 --> 00:48:25,330
Aknot, is that you?

586
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:27,130
What an ugly face.

587
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:28,668
It doesn't suit you.

588
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:30,963
Take it off.

589
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,469
That's better.

590
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:36,304
Never be ashamed
of who you are.

591
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:37,978
You're warriors.
Be proud.

592
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:41,650
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

593
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,920
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

594
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,954
Your time for revenge
is at hand.

595
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:50,583
The ZF-1.

596
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:56,754
It's light. The handle 's adjustable
for easy carrying.

597
00:48:56,966 --> 00:49:00,424
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

598
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,605
A word on fire power:

599
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:06,332
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip,
with bursts of 3 to 300.

600
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,374
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

601
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,606
One shot...

602
00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:15,582
and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

603
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,993
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

604
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:27,696
Rocket launcher.

605
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:30,957
Arrow launcher...

606
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,028
with exploding
or poisonous heads.

607
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,632
Very practical

608
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,103
Net launcher.

609
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,041
The flamethrower.

610
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:45,514
My favorite.

611
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:47,983
And for the grand finale...

612
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:50,618
the new Ice Cube System.

613
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:00,890
Four full crates...

614
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:02,564
delivered right on time.

615
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,701
And what about you,
dear Aknot?

616
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,426
Did you bring
what I asked?

617
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:10,433
Yes.

618
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,439
Magnificent.

619
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:22,775
This...

620
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,718
This case is empty.

621
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:29,383
Empty?

622
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:30,490
Empty...

623
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,287
the opposite of full.

624
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,798
This case
is supposed to be full!

625
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:39,958
Anyone care to explain?

626
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:46,232
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

627
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:51,470
Who took another route.

628
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,782
She's supposed
to contact this person...

629
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,476
in a hotel

630
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,420
And she's looking
for the address.

631
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:04,617
Easy.

632
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,822
Dot.

633
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,136
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

634
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,304
We're saved.

635
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:19,566
I'm screwed.

636
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,141
You asked for a case.
We brought one.

637
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:24,711
A case with four stones
in it!

638
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,111
Not one or two or three,
but four!

639
00:51:27,316 --> 00:51:28,510
Four stones!

640
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,551
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

641
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,848
We are warriors,
not merchants.

642
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,185
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.

643
00:51:37,393 --> 00:51:38,826
Four stones, four crates.

644
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,896
Zero stones, zero crates!

645
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,962
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

646
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:49,596
We risked our lives.

647
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:53,672
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

648
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,011
So you are merchants
after all.

649
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:02,043
Leave him one crate
for the cause.

650
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,385
I don't like warriors.

651
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:07,853
Narrow-minded,
no subtlety...

652
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:11,222
and they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

653
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,262
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasrt saved a single one.

654
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,864
I'll tell you what I do like:
A killer.

655
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:20,491
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold -blooded, clean and methodical

656
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,638
A real killer
picking up the ZF-1...

657
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:26,330
would 've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

658
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:46,225
Bring me the priest.

659
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,266
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

660
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,890
and a blueprint
of the hotel

661
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:56,330
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

662
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,097
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

663
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:02,573
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

664
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,245
There must be a way.

665
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,687
I'll get it.

666
00:53:13,689 --> 00:53:14,656
Weddings?

667
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:18,425
Not really.

668
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:21,427
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?

669
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:23,224
Mr. Zorg.

670
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:24,765
Jean-Baptiste...

671
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,166
Emmanuel...

672
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,302
Zorg.

673
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,135
It's nice to see
you again, Father.

674
00:53:33,342 --> 00:53:35,606
I remember you now.

675
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,704
The so-called art dealer.

676
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,983
I'm glad you got
your memory back.

677
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,981
Because you'll need it.

678
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,588
Where are the stones?

679
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:48,252
I don't know.

680
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:50,721
If I did, I wouldn't tell
someone like you.

681
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,252
Why?

682
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:54,361
What's wrong with me?

683
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,157
I try to serve life.

684
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:59,160
But you only...

685
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:00,968
want to destroy it.

686
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:03,265
Father...

687
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,040
you're so wrong.

688
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,335
Let me explain.

689
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:16,346
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction and chaos.

690
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:17,985
Take this empty glass.

691
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,951
Here it is, peaceful...

692
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,054
boring.

693
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:23,021
But if it is...

694
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,326
destroyed.

695
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:32,458
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

696
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:34,364
Notice how each is useful

697
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,308
What a lovely ballet ensues...

698
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:41,135
so full of form and color.

699
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,711
Now think of all those people
that created them.

700
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:49,311
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

701
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:53,420
so those children can grow up
and have children...

702
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:54,851
and so on.

703
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,060
Thus adding
to the great chain...

704
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:00,061
of life.

705
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:04,260
Water. Fruit.

706
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:08,064
You see, Father,
by creating a little destruction...

707
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:10,437
I'm encouraging life.

708
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,841
In reality,
you and I are in the same business.

709
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,711
Cheers.

710
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:35,087
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

711
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:37,825
Or the engineer?

712
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,901
Or their children, maybe?

713
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:59,045
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

714
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:02,748
How your entire empire
of destruction comes...

715
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,323
crashing down...

716
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,757
all because of one, little...

717
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,592
cherry.

718
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,572
You saved my life...

719
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:25,941
and in return,
I'll spare yours...

720
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,707
for now.

721
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,713
You're a monster, Zorg.

722
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:32,778
I know.

723
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,718
Torture who you have to,
the President, I don't care.

724
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,888
Just bring me the stones.

725
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:43,725
You have one hour.

726
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,974
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

727
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,812
Why is it eating up
all the satellites?

728
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,749
We're working on it.

729
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:22,594
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

730
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:25,137
And the stones?
Did you find them?

731
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,308
They werert on board.

732
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:27,601
What?

733
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,643
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

734
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,610
They gave them
to someone they do trust.

735
00:57:33,582 --> 00:57:36,551
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.

736
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,018
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

737
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,951
She has the stones.

738
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,525
The Mondoshawans will help.

739
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,321
We must send someone...

740
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:47,791
to get the stones.

741
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,021
Excellent.

742
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,199
I want this operation to be
as discreet as possible.

743
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:56,628
No troops.
No big operation.

744
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,398
I want your best man
to go undercover.

745
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:01,405
I have the perfect one.

746
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,977
You've got a message.

747
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,546
Not opening it?
Could be important.

748
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:13,011
Like the last two
were important.

749
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:16,786
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

750
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,856
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

751
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,063
That is bad luck.

752
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:24,391
Grandfather say...

753
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,001
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.

754
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,229
I bet you lunch.

755
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,634
Okay.

756
00:58:35,744 --> 00:58:36,870
Come on.

757
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:40,574
"You are fired."

758
00:58:42,017 --> 00:58:44,178
Oh, I' m sorry.

759
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:51,390
At least I won lunch.

760
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,822
Good philosophy.

761
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:55,724
See good in bad.
Ilike.

762
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,626
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.

763
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,259
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?

764
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:01,336
Hi, Mom.

765
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,529
Seventeen messages.

766
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,163
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.

767
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:07,765
Mr. Kim,
you should go.

768
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:09,740
This'll take a minute.

769
00:59:09,945 --> 00:59:12,778
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.

770
00:59:12,948 --> 00:59:15,280
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.

771
00:59:16,952 --> 00:59:18,442
Good fortune for you.

772
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,590
You don't have a girl
I'll never be a grandmother.

773
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,385
It bring you good luck!

774
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,967
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.

775
00:59:34,136 --> 00:59:35,467
What are you
talking about?

776
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,401
You want to make me beg?

777
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,108
No, all I want
is an explanation.

778
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:41,368
I just got in.

779
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:44,444
I just smashed my cab.
Ilost my job. I got mugged.

780
00:59:44,513 --> 00:59:45,980
Besides that,
everything's peachy.

781
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:47,812
Thanks for asking.

782
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,884
Now settle down
and explain this to me.

783
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:53,111
You don't know
you won a trip...

784
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:56,324
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?

785
00:59:56,525 --> 01:00:00,120
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?

786
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:03,123
If I' d won a trip,
I'd know.

787
01:00:03,465 --> 01:00:05,365
I would 've been notified.

788
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:10,799
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.

789
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:16,503
I'll call you back.

790
01:00:20,115 --> 01:00:23,482
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

791
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,811
Nice apartment.

792
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:29,084
You've settled
into a wonderful life.

793
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,758
Heard you lost your job.

794
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,594
You heard that?

795
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:37,331
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.

796
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:39,524
Don't bother.
We have one for you.

797
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:41,134
"Major Dallas...

798
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,827
you've been selected
for a mission."

799
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,099
- What mission?
- To save the world.

800
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,770
"You leave
for Fhloston Paradise.

801
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,811
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

802
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:52,943
Any questions?

803
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:56,413
Why me? I retired
six months ago. Remember?

804
01:00:56,518 --> 01:00:57,780
Three reasons.

805
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,187
One:

806
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:02,113
As a member
of the Elite Special Forces Unit...

807
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,555
you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

808
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:09,226
Two: You're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

809
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:10,394
The third?

810
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:13,534
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.

811
01:01:14,903 --> 01:01:15,699
Check your messages?

812
01:01:15,904 --> 01:01:17,394
I've had enough good news.

813
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,071
Might be important.

814
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:22,877
You're a winner!

815
01:01:23,078 --> 01:01:26,343
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

816
01:01:29,618 --> 01:01:30,915
Here are your tickets.

817
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,048
You rigged the contest?

818
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:34,920
Congratulations.

819
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:39,220
You couldn't
be more discreet?

820
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:41,588
Old tricks are the best tricks.

821
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,528
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

822
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:48,829
I am not going.

823
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:04,017
Excuse me, General

824
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:07,245
Who is it?

825
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:08,456
Who is it?

826
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:12,225
My wife.

827
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:15,696
Yes... no. I just met this girl,
but I' m going to marry her.

828
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,633
Ilove her,
but she hates the military.

829
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,735
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

830
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,064
She can't have anything
to do with it.

831
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,604
If she sees you,
she'll kill me.

832
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:25,431
- Major...
- You gotta hide somewhere.

833
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,075
You've gotta help me.

834
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,337
We'd love to,
but where can we hide?

835
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,039
We don't
have time for this.

836
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,685
It's just for one minute.

837
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,978
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

838
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,182
No idea...
You have no idea.

839
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,725
- I' m going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

840
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,091
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

841
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,859
Major!

842
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,631
You're on my foot.

843
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,133
Major! Major!

844
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,041
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace...

845
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:04,113
Dallas.

846
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:08,139
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

847
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,215
Is this the way
priests vacation?

848
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,081
We're on a mission.

849
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,483
What kind?

850
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,350
We have to save
the world, my son.

851
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,491
You're gonna
save the world?

852
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:21,322
Yes!

853
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,027
Down there.
Down there.

854
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,402
This is a police control

855
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,248
This is not an exercise.

856
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,950
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

857
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,088
Just stay here
for one minute.

858
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:50,192
- This is a police control
- Don't touch anything.

859
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:52,918
This is not an exercise.

860
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:55,656
Can you please spread your legs...

861
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,700
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.

862
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:01,168
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

863
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,535
Yeah, but l- -

864
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,537
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

865
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:07,869
Let's see it.

866
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,275
Are you classified
as human?

867
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:17,146
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.

868
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,116
I found him.

869
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,149
Mr. Korben Dallas?

870
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:27,554
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

871
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,460
Smoke you!

872
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,095
Wrong answer.

873
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:40,607
The police control
is now terminated.

874
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:44,969
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

875
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,014
We got the guy.
Wasrt easy but we bagged him.

876
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,482
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

877
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,853
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

878
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:58,255
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

879
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,929
and I' II be in Fhloston
in four hours.

880
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,696
Don't come back
without the stones.

881
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,677
We got Korben Dallas.

882
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:23,943
Perfect.

883
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:29,291
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.

884
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,289
LfZorg really wants them...

885
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,621
he'll have to negotiate.

886
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:36,355
Revenge is at hand.

887
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:42,001
Oh, I am so sorry.

888
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,071
I forgot
about the autowash.

889
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,508
There's an autowash
in that shower.

890
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,045
I'm so sorry.

891
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:55,551
Autowash.

892
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,584
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

893
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,714
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.

894
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,894
Both times
you've ended up in my arms.

895
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,326
It's my lucky day.

896
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,159
Lucky day.

897
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,044
Did you hear something?

898
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:25,408
Cornelius.

899
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:32,747
Autowash.

900
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,524
- I' m so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

901
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,060
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

902
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,096
Autowash.

903
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,066
Coffee's not my specialty.

904
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:52,574
But you must drink a lot
of coffee being a priest.

905
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,312
I know. I' m not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

906
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,163
I'll take the mission.

907
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,982
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

908
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,244
Good.

909
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,918
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

910
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,786
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.

911
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:47,796
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.

912
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,692
Now David is...

913
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,497
in great shape.
He'll protect you.

914
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:56,800
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

915
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,405
Now. Yes.

916
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:00,937
Okay.

917
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,974
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.

918
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,887
The tickets.

919
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,587
- I.D., please.
- I' m sorry.

920
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,951
- There.
- In here?

921
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:21,454
Mr. Dallas?

922
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:25,723
Congratulations on the contest.

923
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,669
Oh, right. Okay.

924
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,432
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

925
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:31,731
The garbage.

926
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:37,979
Made it!

927
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,641
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it...

928
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:44,081
so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

929
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,220
Now David must go.

930
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,217
Thank you. Bye.

931
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,158
I am Korben Dallas.

932
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,427
And this is?

933
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,762
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.

934
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:00,760
Multi-pass.

935
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,667
She knows
it's a multi-pass.

936
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,764
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.

937
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,604
Bump into each other, sparks happen...
She knows.

938
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,245
Anyway, we're in love.

939
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,610
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

940
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,117
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

941
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,594
- You want more?
- Yeah.

942
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,122
Make that two.

943
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,132
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

944
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:35,533
What!

945
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,262
I didn't know
what to do.

946
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,141
But this is not possible.

947
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,176
This is not possible.

948
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,710
You want some more?

949
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,211
This is all my fault.

950
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,750
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

951
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:49,885
I know.

952
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,688
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

953
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,757
Prepare for our arrival
I go to face my destiny.

954
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,988
I don't want
to go to Egypt.

955
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,892
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?

956
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,138
That's me.

957
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,303
Just a minute, please.

958
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,308
It will just take
one more minute.

959
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,327
We'll be right back.

960
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,592
Mr. Dallas...

961
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,529
we really need you now.

962
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,863
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and needs to interview you.

963
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:45,230
Multi-pass.

964
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,247
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

965
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,876
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.

966
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,121
Backup unit, zone 18.

967
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:22,270
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.

968
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,410
He's so green.

969
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:25,771
I'm sure you're excited.

970
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,949
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

971
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,075
I prefer to remain anonymous.

972
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,384
Korben Dallas!

973
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:39,822
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

974
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:43,760
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

975
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,491
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

976
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,407
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

977
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,835
Right on.

978
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,111
And he's got
something to say...

979
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,678
to those 50 billion pairs of ears
out there.

980
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,509
Pop it, D-man.

981
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,520
Hi.

982
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,956
Unbelievable.

983
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:13,123
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.

984
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,626
Right here
from five to seven.

985
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:18,322
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

986
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,000
His dreams...

987
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,431
his desires...

988
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,332
his most intimates of intimates.

989
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:27,337
And from what I' m looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

990
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,339
So tell me, my man...

991
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,011
you nervous in the service?

992
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,440
Not really.

993
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,814
Freeze those knees 'cause Korbers
in the place and he's on the case.

994
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,924
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's Prince...

995
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,288
of Fhloston Paradise!

996
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,664
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

997
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,299
A magic fountain flowing
with nonstop wine, women and...

998
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,196
hootchie-kootchie-koo...

999
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,993
all night long.

1000
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,199
All night long
All night

1001
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:09,909
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

1002
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,088
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.

1003
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:17,487
On the trail of the sexiest
man of the year: D-man, your man...

1004
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,024
End of transmission.

1005
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,929
See you tomorrow at five.

1006
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,204
How was it?

1007
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,109
It was just absolutely green.

1008
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:36,711
Green like what?

1009
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:38,943
Crystal green.

1010
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:41,107
Any kind of green
you want...

1011
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,147
tree green, emerald,
pond green.

1012
01:13:56,298 --> 01:14:00,132
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

1013
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:03,898
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

1014
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:05,463
It must pop, pop, pop!

1015
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,064
So tomorrow, from five to seven...

1016
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,474
please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

1017
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,540
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

1018
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,951
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

1019
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:20,282
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

1020
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,424
Tomorrow, from five to seven,
you'll give yourself a hand.

1021
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:24,823
Green?

1022
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,221
Super green.

1023
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,924
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

1024
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,292
That's me.

1025
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,665
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

1026
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:42,840
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

1027
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,772
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.

1028
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,678
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

1029
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,781
I need to talk
to someone!

1030
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:53,682
I don't believe this!

1031
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,954
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control

1032
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,253
I'm sorry. I' m calm.

1033
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,588
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

1034
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:05,229
To make your flight short...

1035
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,535
flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

1036
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,632
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

1037
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:16,136
Thank you.

1038
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:20,579
Hi.

1039
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:23,377
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.

1040
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,713
Good.

1041
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,318
We are not on vacation.

1042
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:31,015
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

1043
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,162
If I hadrt come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

1044
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,387
Understand?

1045
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,655
Yes.

1046
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:38,867
But you, no trouble.

1047
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,095
Me, Fifth Element.

1048
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,805
Supreme Being.

1049
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,666
Me protect you.

1050
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,180
Sleep.

1051
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,218
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.

1052
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:03,789
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

1053
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:04,959
Thank you.

1054
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,252
Are you operative?

1055
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,189
Zone two?

1056
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,589
Everything's ready, Captain.

1057
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:11,698
What?

1058
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:13,959
Assume your
individual position.

1059
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,966
But I want all positions!

1060
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,534
Mr. Rhod...

1061
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,838
Parasites in landing gear.

1062
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:22,968
Ground, copy?

1063
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:24,668
Got it.
Front gear.

1064
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:27,543
Hey, man,
give me some heat, man!

1065
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:31,378
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!

1066
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,719
Some heat over here, man!

1067
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:38,085
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!

1068
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,233
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

1069
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,475
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

1070
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:04,945
Take that.

1071
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,521
Mr. Rhod!

1072
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,416
You can call me Ruby.

1073
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,652
Fueled and ready to go.

1074
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,196
I'll buy you one.

1075
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:21,132
Taken off already?

1076
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,437
I'm not on the plane.

1077
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,004
What?

1078
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,869
The real Dallas
took my place.

1079
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,474
I don't understand.

1080
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,134
Are you making fun of me?

1081
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,439
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!

1082
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,674
I never felt this way before
with a human.

1083
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:36,885
Really?

1084
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:42,887
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.

1085
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,057
Ground is clear.

1086
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,792
Ready for liftoff?

1087
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,196
Confirmed.

1088
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:03,909
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

1089
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:05,704
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

1090
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,876
- Protection?
- Confirmed

1091
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,078
Power increase.

1092
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:15,355
Ten seconds.

1093
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,014
I am...

1094
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:18,919
a little...

1095
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,021
disappointed.

1096
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:21,821
5...

1097
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:24,555
If there is one thing
I do not like...

1098
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:25,391
3...

1099
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:27,159
it is to be...

1100
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:28,028
2...

1101
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,171
disappointed.

1102
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,031
1...

1103
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,174
Sorry, it will
never happen again.

1104
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:34,541
I know.

1105
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,677
Liftoff.

1106
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:50,258
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.

1107
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,720
We're finally
getting something.

1108
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:21,254
It's sending
radio wavelengths.

1109
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:23,147
What does it want
with radio waves?

1110
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,389
Maybe it wants
to make a call.

1111
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,225
Zorg's office.

1112
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,632
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

1113
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:37,896
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1114
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,801
and Mr. Shadow's
on the line.

1115
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,753
It's Shadow again.

1116
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,654
Zorg here.

1117
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,153
Am I disturbing you?

1118
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,588
No, no, I was just...

1119
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,156
Where are you?

1120
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,128
Not far now.

1121
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,659
Good.

1122
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,803
Good, good.

1123
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:14,408
How are the stones?

1124
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,138
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.

1125
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,316
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

1126
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,179
but it wasrt easy.

1127
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,820
My costs have tripled.

1128
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:30,783
Money is of no...

1129
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,494
importance.

1130
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,296
I...

1131
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,756
want...

1132
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,068
the stones.

1133
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,601
The stones...

1134
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,635
will be here.

1135
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,373
I'll see to it
personally.

1136
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:53,036
I will be among you...

1137
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:54,977
soon.

1138
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:58,820
We lost it.

1139
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,552
We lost the signal

1140
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:01,723
Damn!

1141
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:22,903
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.

1142
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:25,113
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.

1143
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,011
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahreneit.

1144
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:33,153
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.

1145
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:55,136
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.

1146
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,549
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

1147
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,159
Parasites in the main ventilation.

1148
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,988
Again?
I'll get it.

1149
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:57,668
Have we arrived yet?

1150
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,640
Oh, good.

1151
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,111
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1152
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,338
All the restaurants
are between levels two and ten.

1153
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:11,610
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p. M...

1154
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,515
then the airship goes higher...

1155
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:15,280
to offer you a better view.

1156
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:16,785
Is the Diva here?

1157
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,118
Not yet.

1158
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,850
Any tickets left
for the opera?

1159
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,829
You have a seat reserved,
front row...

1160
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,056
next to Ruby Rhod!

1161
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:28,327
He's so talented.
Ilove him. He's so sexy.

1162
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:31,904
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

1163
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,409
Where can I get
something to wear?

1164
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,647
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1165
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:52,857
You miserable bastard,
I never should 've pushed you out.

1166
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,928
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?

1167
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,689
I should 've gotten
a robot.

1168
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:59,459
Come on, Ma.

1169
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,927
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.

1170
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,695
I need a cocktail

1171
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:27,726
Get the case in.

1172
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:33,495
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.

1173
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:37,001
Welcome to the...
I'm security.

1174
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,039
Welcome to the...

1175
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,437
Tall.

1176
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:01,023
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

1177
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,096
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1178
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,597
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you are here.

1179
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:11,772
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1180
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:19,375
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.

1181
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:22,583
Helm to 108.

1182
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:25,585
Helm 108!

1183
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:26,880
Helm to 108.

1184
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:29,554
Time to join Ruby Rhod...

1185
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:33,626
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...

1186
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:36,194
of the Gemini Croquette contest.

1187
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:39,559
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...

1188
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,128
Paradise!

1189
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:46,137
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

1190
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:49,139
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1191
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,403
and 8,000 other lucksters here...

1192
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:56,414
to enjoy the privilege of
the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1193
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:02,084
Now we enter what must be...

1194
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,919
the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

1195
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:09,153
A perfect replica
of an old opera house...

1196
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,290
but who cares?

1197
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,136
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1198
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,831
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1199
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,770
He's not going to get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

1200
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:24,110
To who?

1201
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:28,112
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1202
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:31,844
The Emperor of KodarJaphet
and his lovely daughter.

1203
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:35,147
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1204
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,689
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1205
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,729
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

1206
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:44,593
for Korben to say
the word of the day.

1207
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:50,135
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

1208
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:54,038
Thrilled.

1209
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,907
And now...

1210
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:57,978
champagne!

1211
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,349
Commercial
Commercial

1212
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:08,188
Break for 30 seconds.

1213
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:26,135
Show time.

1214
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:22,116
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

1215
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,123
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

1216
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,424
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.

1217
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:45,639
Champagne for the Diva.

1218
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:47,447
I'll take it.

1219
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:23,684
I found it.

1220
01:30:58,553 --> 01:30:59,520
Get her!

1221
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:35,181
It was an ambush.

1222
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,616
If it's war they want...

1223
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:42,982
it's war they'll get!

1224
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:47,891
Bravo! Bravo!

1225
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:50,156
Bravo! Bravo!

1226
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:51,992
My compliments, little lady.

1227
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,533
Thank you for doing
the dirty work.

1228
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,603
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

1229
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,466
Hand over the stones.

1230
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,108
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

1231
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:46,516
Hands up!

1232
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:57,014
I know this music.

1233
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,419
Let's change the beat.

1234
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:10,094
I think we're
being attacked.

1235
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:11,568
They're everywhere.

1236
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:14,832
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.

1237
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:18,273
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.

1238
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,346
Mangalores.

1239
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:24,581
The government
sent me to help you.

1240
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:26,377
If somebody hears this,
come and get me.

1241
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:28,951
I'm in the first row.

1242
01:35:30,992 --> 01:35:32,584
You must give her the stones.

1243
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:33,694
Who?

1244
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:35,418
The Fifth Element.

1245
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:40,062
The Supreme Being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1246
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,201
Leeloo?

1247
01:35:43,638 --> 01:35:46,971
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

1248
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:49,534
She needs your help...

1249
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:51,539
and your love...

1250
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,437
or...

1251
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:55,978
she will die.

1252
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:01,215
Stay with me.

1253
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:02,616
Help!

1254
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,991
If you want
something done...

1255
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,094
do it yourself.

1256
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:16,794
Come on, honey.
You can't die.

1257
01:36:17,038 --> 01:36:19,131
Wake up!
Where are the stones?

1258
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:21,641
Where are the stones?

1259
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,005
The stones.

1260
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,589
They're not here.

1261
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:42,022
The stones,
where are they?

1262
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:45,665
In me.

1263
01:36:46,067 --> 01:36:47,034
What?

1264
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:55,505
Oh, my God, Korben.

1265
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:57,337
Korben, another one coming.

1266
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:00,207
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

1267
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,281
Hey, you!

1268
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:04,351
I said you.

1269
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,282
- I' m not with him.
- Where's the other?

1270
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:10,790
I said, "one minute."

1271
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:12,515
Ruby, hold this gun.

1272
01:37:12,727 --> 01:37:14,194
What do you
want me to do?

1273
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:15,295
Come on.

1274
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:16,887
Put your hand
on it.

1275
01:37:17,098 --> 01:37:19,362
- What do I do?
- Lfhe moves, squeeze the trigger.

1276
01:37:20,101 --> 01:37:21,966
I don't feel right.

1277
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,468
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

1278
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:37,380
I got a headache.
This ain't me.

1279
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:57,096
Sorry.

1280
01:37:58,439 --> 01:37:59,497
Think he'll be okay?

1281
01:38:07,148 --> 01:38:09,514
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1282
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,951
Shit. Three coming.

1283
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,915
You guard this
with your life...

1284
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,128
or you'll look like him.
You green?

1285
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:22,262
Green.

1286
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:23,691
Super green?

1287
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,264
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

1288
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:30,267
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1289
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,156
Move! Move!

1290
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:02,360
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1291
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:03,561
Ladies and gentlemen...

1292
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:05,229
this is amazing.

1293
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:08,899
Let me do it.

1294
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:17,241
Oh, my God.

1295
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,327
The gun!

1296
01:39:29,196 --> 01:39:31,096
Give me the gun.

1297
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:32,424
I'm going to go...

1298
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:36,831
and try to see if I can see
something a little closer.

1299
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:55,182
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1300
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:05,532
Thanks, Ray.

1301
01:40:06,534 --> 01:40:10,129
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

1302
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:11,338
Get up!

1303
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,905
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

1304
01:40:14,108 --> 01:40:15,405
I'm not armed.

1305
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,080
Oh, my God.

1306
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:21,873
I'm on vacation.

1307
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:24,342
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.

1308
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:25,509
I won a...

1309
01:40:27,288 --> 01:40:28,414
contest.

1310
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:30,590
Gemini Croquette's to...

1311
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:32,156
Fhloston Paradise.

1312
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:35,395
Down.

1313
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:39,092
Wait a minute.

1314
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:40,495
Get down!

1315
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:43,728
He's trying
to say something.

1316
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:44,735
Down!

1317
01:40:59,253 --> 01:41:00,447
Sorry, my man.

1318
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:11,122
Where are you?

1319
01:41:12,499 --> 01:41:14,797
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1320
01:41:15,336 --> 01:41:17,463
They're coming.
They're coming.

1321
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:22,566
Don't move.

1322
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:34,913
What you doing?

1323
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:36,646
Count to ten.

1324
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:47,432
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

1325
01:41:47,701 --> 01:41:49,931
3! 4! 5!

1326
01:41:51,372 --> 01:41:52,339
7, 8...

1327
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:54,839
9...

1328
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:20,260
10.

1329
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,705
I am...

1330
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:30,172
very disappointed.

1331
01:42:30,844 --> 01:42:33,039
Korben, what are you
looking for?

1332
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:34,373
Control room.

1333
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:37,878
- This is it.
- I' II be here.

1334
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:39,350
Let's go.

1335
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,390
Quiet! Quiet!

1336
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:47,188
You in charge?

1337
01:42:48,429 --> 01:42:49,896
How many
are out there?

1338
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:52,658
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1339
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,195
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

1340
01:43:04,712 --> 01:43:06,680
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

1341
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:10,711
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

1342
01:43:11,251 --> 01:43:13,685
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

1343
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:15,914
That's the leader.

1344
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:17,920
Send someone to negotiate.

1345
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:22,426
I've never negotiated.

1346
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:24,595
You mind if I try?

1347
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:29,168
We're sending
somebody to negotiate.

1348
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,170
Anybody else
want to negotiate?

1349
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:43,042
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1350
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:44,881
I wonder.

1351
01:43:49,456 --> 01:43:50,753
Where's Ruby?

1352
01:43:51,759 --> 01:43:53,192
I thought he was dead.

1353
01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:54,359
Master!

1354
01:43:55,095 --> 01:43:57,620
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

1355
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,632
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1356
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:02,199
still alive.

1357
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:04,265
What's wrong with you?

1358
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:05,633
It hurt!

1359
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:15,378
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1360
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,982
but I' m fighting
for a noble cause.

1361
01:44:18,185 --> 01:44:20,983
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1362
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:23,487
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.

1363
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:24,748
Leeloo's in trouble?

1364
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:26,983
When is Leeloo
not in trouble?

1365
01:44:27,528 --> 01:44:28,995
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.

1366
01:44:34,535 --> 01:44:35,502
Hang on.

1367
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,130
Here, come on.

1368
01:44:40,174 --> 01:44:42,142
How do you get yourself
into these positions?

1369
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:44,605
Come on.

1370
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:50,850
I'm here. It 's all right.
Everything's okay now.

1371
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:52,309
Listen.

1372
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:57,957
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

1373
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:04,529
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

1374
01:45:14,575 --> 01:45:16,167
If it was a bomb...

1375
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:20,642
the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

1376
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:22,716
This is a type "A"alert.

1377
01:45:22,716 --> 01:45:25,276
This is a type "A"alert.

1378
01:45:25,919 --> 01:45:28,444
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.

1379
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:31,348
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...

1380
01:45:31,592 --> 01:45:33,059
Stay calm!

1381
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,718
...located in the main hallways.

1382
01:45:34,862 --> 01:45:36,056
Stay calm!

1383
01:45:41,768 --> 01:45:44,362
You know how to stop this,
right?

1384
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:53,375
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.

1385
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:56,382
Get back!

1386
01:45:56,617 --> 01:45:58,209
Evacuation!
Evacuation!

1387
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:01,751
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel

1388
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:07,853
I know.

1389
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,241
I don't want to die.

1390
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:25,606
Please, my son.

1391
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:27,577
Get in.

1392
01:46:32,419 --> 01:46:35,149
One minute to total evacuation.

1393
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,927
This one.

1394
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:46,128
45 seconds.

1395
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:50,994
Get her strapped in.

1396
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:58,770
You know how to fly this?

1397
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:00,139
Like driving a cab.

1398
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:06,785
How will we
get out the door?

1399
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,131
15 seconds.

1400
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:28,033
10...

1401
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:29,698
9, 8...

1402
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:32,037
7...

1403
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:33,812
6...

1404
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:35,038
5.

1405
01:47:51,865 --> 01:47:53,730
For the honor.

1406
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:00,740
Hold on.

1407
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:24,324
Like driving a cab.

1408
01:48:26,366 --> 01:48:29,028
It is now 7 p.m.,
time for the news.

1409
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:31,102
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1410
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:33,165
End of transmission.

1411
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:36,109
That's the best show
I ever did.

1412
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:41,775
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1413
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:44,712
and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

1414
01:48:49,289 --> 01:48:50,586
We're saved.

1415
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,434
The Diva said
I should take care of you.

1416
01:49:10,577 --> 01:49:13,137
Humans act so strange.

1417
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,439
What do you mean?

1418
01:49:16,183 --> 01:49:18,208
Everything you created...

1419
01:49:18,318 --> 01:49:20,013
is used to destroy.

1420
01:49:22,255 --> 01:49:23,745
We call it human nature.

1421
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:25,925
You learn that
on your screen?

1422
01:49:26,126 --> 01:49:28,924
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."

1423
01:49:29,796 --> 01:49:31,093
"V" is good.

1424
01:49:31,498 --> 01:49:33,398
Some good words in "V."

1425
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,831
Like what?

1426
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,467
"Valiant."

1427
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:40,301
"Vulnerable."

1428
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:44,401
"Very beautiful"

1429
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:58,657
Oh, of course, Munro!

1430
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,118
Mr. President?

1431
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:02,487
Now what?

1432
01:50:05,899 --> 01:50:07,264
We have a problem.

1433
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:14,136
It's advancing?

1434
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:17,868
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

1435
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:25,681
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1436
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:35,460
Korben, there's
a general on the phone.

1437
01:50:36,329 --> 01:50:37,887
I'll give you
the President.

1438
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:42,067
Major Dallas, I first
would like to salute a warrior.

1439
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:44,629
You're a shining example
of this army.

1440
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:46,566
In the name
of the Federation...

1441
01:50:46,673 --> 01:50:48,698
Any idea when you'll
get to the point?

1442
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:55,904
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
heading straight for earth...

1443
01:50:56,116 --> 01:50:59,381
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.

1444
01:51:02,756 --> 01:51:04,223
How much time do we have?

1445
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:08,716
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1446
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:11,864
I'll call you back
in two hours.

1447
01:51:12,065 --> 01:51:13,157
Hello?

1448
01:52:24,604 --> 01:52:26,538
They just landed
in the desert.

1449
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:30,502
Good job, David.

1450
01:52:32,212 --> 01:52:34,407
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

1451
01:52:42,188 --> 01:52:44,019
You got it figured out, Father?

1452
01:52:44,124 --> 01:52:46,684
This one should be fire.

1453
01:52:46,993 --> 01:52:49,120
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

1454
01:52:49,296 --> 01:52:52,424
The four stones
should go around.

1455
01:52:52,565 --> 01:52:54,692
The Fifth Element should be
in the middle...

1456
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:57,599
and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1457
01:52:58,305 --> 01:53:00,364
You've never seen this work?

1458
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,607
Give me that.

1459
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:05,209
Every weapon has a manual
I'm sure this has one too.

1460
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:14,712
That's it.
That's it.

1461
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:16,318
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!

1462
01:53:18,024 --> 01:53:19,082
Wind.

1463
01:53:20,927 --> 01:53:22,986
My man, what you doing?

1464
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:28,097
Trying to keep you
in the D.J. Business.

1465
01:53:31,838 --> 01:53:32,805
Fire.

1466
01:53:34,507 --> 01:53:35,405
Done.

1467
01:53:35,608 --> 01:53:36,632
What happens?

1468
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:39,403
So, now,
we have to open them.

1469
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:42,515
And you know how to do that.
Right?

1470
01:53:42,615 --> 01:53:43,912
Theoretically...

1471
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:46,743
No.

1472
01:53:51,624 --> 01:53:53,251
Leeloo, honey, wake up.

1473
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:54,654
You have to help us.

1474
01:53:55,462 --> 01:53:57,327
How do you open the stones?

1475
01:53:58,631 --> 01:54:00,496
Wind blows.

1476
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:03,592
Fire burns.

1477
01:54:03,803 --> 01:54:07,136
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1478
01:54:07,474 --> 01:54:08,668
Rain...

1479
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:13,509
falls.

1480
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,382
What does it mean?

1481
01:54:23,223 --> 01:54:24,520
I think that...

1482
01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:25,850
Maybe it's a charade.

1483
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:27,523
A game or something.

1484
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:30,452
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

1485
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,191
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1486
01:54:44,844 --> 01:54:46,141
Too late.

1487
01:54:47,914 --> 01:54:49,541
We've lost contact with them.

1488
01:54:49,749 --> 01:54:51,080
Three minutes.

1489
01:54:52,585 --> 01:54:53,882
I think mine is broken.

1490
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:55,545
Why I gotta get
the broke one?

1491
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:05,722
We're never gonna make it.

1492
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:13,235
It moved.

1493
01:55:14,441 --> 01:55:16,909
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

1494
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:18,576
Shut up, shut up!

1495
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:24,179
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.

1496
01:55:24,284 --> 01:55:28,584
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said...

1497
01:55:29,556 --> 01:55:31,023
"We're not going to make it."

1498
01:55:33,159 --> 01:55:34,353
And that's it?

1499
01:55:43,169 --> 01:55:44,431
Korben, my man.

1500
01:55:45,171 --> 01:55:46,138
Wind.

1501
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:49,268
She said, "Wind blows."

1502
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,717
Everyone take a stone.

1503
01:55:59,085 --> 01:56:01,952
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

1504
01:56:04,424 --> 01:56:05,550
Earth.

1505
01:56:05,825 --> 01:56:07,292
Open the other one.

1506
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:25,576
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.

1507
01:56:25,778 --> 01:56:27,905
I have no matches.
Do you have any?

1508
01:56:28,114 --> 01:56:30,480
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?

1509
01:56:30,683 --> 01:56:33,311
Got some matches?
We need some fire.

1510
01:56:35,288 --> 01:56:36,312
We're going to die.

1511
01:56:43,630 --> 01:56:45,029
Don't breathe.

1512
01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:07,210
One minute.

1513
01:57:07,287 --> 01:57:08,982
Let's go, Leeloo.

1514
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:12,149
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1515
01:57:12,892 --> 01:57:14,382
Protect life...

1516
01:57:15,662 --> 01:57:16,890
until death.

1517
01:57:17,063 --> 01:57:18,223
Listen to me!

1518
01:57:18,398 --> 01:57:19,888
Listen to me.

1519
01:57:20,066 --> 01:57:22,728
Listen,
I know you're very tired.

1520
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:26,633
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

1521
01:57:26,906 --> 01:57:28,498
But if you don't
do something right now...

1522
01:57:28,675 --> 01:57:30,233
we'll all die.

1523
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:34,073
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1524
01:57:34,414 --> 01:57:37,076
It'll enter the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1525
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:40,076
You're right.
You're right.

1526
01:57:40,253 --> 01:57:42,414
There are some things...

1527
01:57:42,589 --> 01:57:44,921
very nice things won'th saving:
Beautiful things.

1528
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:47,155
Beautiful things.

1529
01:57:48,261 --> 01:57:49,751
Like love?

1530
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:51,955
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.

1531
01:57:51,998 --> 01:57:54,432
That's a good example.
Love is won'th saving.

1532
01:57:55,368 --> 01:57:57,131
I don't know love.

1533
01:57:59,172 --> 01:58:00,469
I don't know love.

1534
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:02,972
I was built to protect,
not love.

1535
01:58:03,176 --> 01:58:05,974
So there's no use for me
other than this.

1536
01:58:06,179 --> 01:58:08,147
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1537
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:10,476
I need you.

1538
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,311
I need you,
very much.

1539
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:15,179
Why?

1540
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:18,487
Because...

1541
01:58:18,825 --> 01:58:20,190
because...

1542
01:58:20,994 --> 01:58:23,155
Tell her, Korben.

1543
01:58:24,998 --> 01:58:26,488
Tell me.

1544
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:31,670
Because...

1545
01:58:32,005 --> 01:58:33,336
Tell me.

1546
01:58:35,475 --> 01:58:36,942
- Tell me.
- Because l- -

1547
01:58:37,176 --> 01:58:38,666
Because I love you.

1548
01:58:39,946 --> 01:58:41,208
Ilove you.

1549
01:58:46,185 --> 01:58:47,152
9...

1550
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:51,154
6, 5...

1551
01:58:51,624 --> 01:58:53,353
4, 3...

1552
01:59:34,133 --> 01:59:38,263
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.

1553
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,735
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

1554
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:56,817
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?

1555
01:59:57,023 --> 01:59:59,491
Every five minutes
it's a bomb or something.

1556
01:59:59,659 --> 02:00:00,990
I'm leaving.

1557
02:00:15,575 --> 02:00:16,906
Mr. President.

1558
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:19,740
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the center.

1559
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:21,743
It's an honor, Mr. President.

1560
02:00:21,814 --> 02:00:23,611
Where are my two heroes?

1561
02:00:23,683 --> 02:00:27,517
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

1562
02:00:27,687 --> 02:00:29,587
I have 19 meetings after this.

1563
02:00:29,756 --> 02:00:32,156
Let me see
if they're revived.

1564
02:00:32,325 --> 02:00:33,417
Thank you.

1565
02:00:33,693 --> 02:00:36,025
We go live in one minute.

1566
02:00:44,103 --> 02:00:45,161
They're...

1567
02:00:46,873 --> 02:00:48,101
not ready.

1568
02:00:49,108 --> 02:00:50,166
They need...

1569
02:00:50,343 --> 02:00:51,605
five more minutes.

1570
02:00:51,778 --> 02:00:53,109
You have 20 seconds.

1571
02:00:53,246 --> 02:00:55,441
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.

1572
02:00:56,783 --> 02:00:58,444
Some woman.
Claims to be Korbers mother.

1573
02:00:58,618 --> 02:00:59,778
Give it here.

1574
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,615
Mrs. Dallas,
this is the President.

1575
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:05,621
On behalf
of the Federation...

1576
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:07,623
That doesn't
even sound like him.

1577
02:01:07,794 --> 02:01:10,194
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.

1578
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:11,924
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...

1579
02:01:11,998 --> 02:01:13,590
just avoid me as usual

1580
02:01:13,666 --> 02:01:17,363
I'll throw myselfin traffic.
I'll Saran Wrap myselfto the bed.

1581
02:01:17,363 --> 02:01:20,363
