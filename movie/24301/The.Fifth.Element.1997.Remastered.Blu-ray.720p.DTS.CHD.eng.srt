4
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,135
Come, come!

5
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,736
Please!

6
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,996
Aziz, light!

7
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,602
Aziz...

8
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,770
light.

9
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,772
Good.

10
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,664
We start again.

11
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,279
"When the three planets
are in eclipse...

12
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,606
the black hole,
like a door, is open.

13
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,646
Evil comes...

14
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,115
spreading terror and chaos."

15
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,778
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

16
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,892
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I' ve got your snakes.

17
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,516
I got all the snakes.

18
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,992
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

19
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,495
If this is the five...

20
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,793
and this is the one...

21
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,299
every 5,000 years.

22
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,970
So, I' ve got some time then.

23
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,981
You bring them water.

24
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,983
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.

25
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,993
Go with God.
Be safe from evil

26
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,393
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

27
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,659
gathering the four elements
of life...

28
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,702
water, fire, earth, air...

29
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,770
around a fifth one.

30
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,240
Afifth...

31
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,370
element.

32
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,575
Forgive me, Lord.

33
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,717
They already know
too much.

34
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,521
Father.

35
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,119
How are you?

36
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,353
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

37
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,397
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

38
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,965
It's the greatest find
in history.

39
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,466
You must be parched.

40
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,466
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,973
It's like a battle plan.

42
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,700
Here the good.

43
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,109
Here the evil

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,539
And here, a weapon...

45
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,774
against evil

46
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,611
I'm going
to be famous.

47
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,715
Then let us toast
to your fame.

48
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,221
To fame.

49
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,087
Salute.

50
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,933
You can't toast
with water.

51
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,299
Billy, in my sack,
the grappa.

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,846
This I don't understand.

53
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,485
This could be something...

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,783
prehistoric.

55
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,288
I don't know.

56
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,323
But, wait.

57
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,024
Here.

58
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,331
Look, look.

59
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,839
They're here.

60
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,989
This man...

61
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,616
this perfect being.

62
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,254
I know this is the key.
I know it.

63
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,695
This divine light
they talk about.

64
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,872
What is divine light?

65
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,569
Aziz, light!

66
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,511
Much better.
Thank you.

67
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,653
My Lord.

68
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,909
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I' ve ever seen.

69
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,272
Don't you think?

70
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,075
Are you German?

71
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,246
Lord...

72
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,424
I know he was about
to discover everything.

73
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,717
But, no worry.

74
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,722
I was there in time.

75
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,154
Priest...

76
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,990
you and those before you...

77
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,133
have served us well.

78
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,529
But war is coming.

79
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,796
Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

80
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,648
This...

81
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,857
is really amazing.

82
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,025
The fifth element.

83
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,863
Take the stones.

84
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,704
My Lord...

85
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,138
if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenseless...

86
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,570
when evil returns.

87
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
In 300 years...

88
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,309
when evil returns...

89
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,449
so shall we.

90
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,916
Oh, Professor.

91
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,560
Professor.

92
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,598
Don't move!

93
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,861
I have a gun!

94
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,442
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

95
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,702
Friends?

96
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,405
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!

97
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,072
I'll explain everything.

98
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,848
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

99
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,215
I am your friend.

100
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,777
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

101
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,718
Please, put...

102
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,018
the gun down.

103
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,319
Billy, no!

104
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,803
Hurry!

105
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,198
The wall is closing!

106
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,203
Here is your mission:

107
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,501
Pass your knowledge
to the next priest...

108
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,237
as it was passed to you.

109
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,210
I will do as
you command, but...

110
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,211
hurry, you still
have time.

111
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,145
Time not important.

112
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,807
Only life...

113
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,011
important.

114
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,135
I will fulfill
my mission!

115
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,826
You can count on me!

116
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,508
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

117
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,797
Anything yet?

118
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,206
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.

119
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,868
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5,000.

120
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,081
Let's see it.

121
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,356
It's taking shape.

122
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,610
Send out a probe.

123
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,587
Ladies and gentlemen...

124
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,922
the President of
the Federated Territories.

125
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,357
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

126
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,533
I saved this seat
for you, Father.

127
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,009
President on the line.

128
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,407
We're in position.

129
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,606
I have to address the Supreme Council
Just the facts.

130
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,284
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

131
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,183
All the calibers are overshot.

132
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,085
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.

133
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,054
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

134
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,720
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

135
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,794
Recommendation?

136
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,989
My philosophy is:
Shoot first and ask questions later.

137
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,634
I don't like uninvited guests.

138
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,930
All right, then.

139
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,127
Mr. President?

140
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,303
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.

141
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,302
I...

142
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,141
have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

143
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,083
You have 20 seconds.

144
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,354
Imagine that this...

145
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,623
thing is not anything
that can be identified...

146
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,026
because it prefers not to be.

147
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,832
Wherever there is life...

148
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,001
it brings death...

149
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,136
Absolute evil

150
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,829
One more reason
to shoot first.

151
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,668
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

152
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,344
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

153
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,916
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

154
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,284
Growth rate is at 27%.

155
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,393
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time to go into it.

156
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,020
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

157
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,700
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

158
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,862
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

159
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,632
You may fire when ready.

160
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,005
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

161
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,950
Its structure solidified
on the surface.

162
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,713
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

163
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,252
The most...

164
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,983
terrible intelligence imaginable.

165
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,154
120's loaded.

166
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,991
The ship is
in combat formation.

167
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,099
Missiles are loaded.

168
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,394
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,070
I have a doubt.

170
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,201
I don't, Mr. President.

171
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,118
What happened?
Can you hear me?

172
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,022
What happened?

173
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,747
- Did you destroy it?
- I' m about to.

174
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,395
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

175
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,034
It's moving toward the ship.

176
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,640
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

177
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,141
Nothing, sir.

178
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,039
Staedert, do you hear me?

179
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,745
Get out of there.

180
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,144
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

181
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,447
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?

182
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,624
Do you understand?
Listen.

183
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,420
That's an order.

184
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,761
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?

185
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,925
Get out of there!

186
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,967
Good God!

187
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,955
Four a day.

188
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,906
I'm tryir

189
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,575
To quit is my goal

190
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,583
I'm up.

191
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,711
All right, I' m up.

192
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,150
God.

193
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,226
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.

194
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,263
Hi, sweetie.

195
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,626
I love you too.

196
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,359
You haven't called me that
since basic training.

197
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,494
I was talking
to the cat.

198
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,194
I forgot...

199
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,831
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.

200
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,497
At least the cat
comes back.

201
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,835
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?

202
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,376
There's millions
out there.

203
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,038
I don't want
a million.

204
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,175
I just want one.

205
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,383
The perfect one.

206
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,179
It don't exist, Major.

207
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,218
Yeah, I know.

208
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,190
What?

209
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,258
Picture of you.

210
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,892
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

211
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,494
Must be an old picture.

212
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,788
Bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul

213
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,260
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.

214
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,600
I don't need one.

215
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,862
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.

216
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,701
Finger, I drive
a cab now...

217
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,535
not a space fighter.

218
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,440
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?

219
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,774
Major, how many points?

220
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,416
At least 50.

221
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,976
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.

222
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,452
See you tonight.

223
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,659
Welcome to Paradise.

224
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,490
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.

225
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,567
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...

226
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,964
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!

227
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,470
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.

228
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,236
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.

229
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,469
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

230
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,010
For a perfect world.

231
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,979
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

232
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,579
Long enough.
Give me the cash.

233
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,485
Is that a Z-140?

234
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,920
Alleviated titanium.

235
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,526
Neurocharged assault model

236
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,765
Good thing for me
it's not loaded.

237
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,198
It's not loaded?

238
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,867
You have to...

239
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,931
push that yellow button
to load it.

240
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,268
Take your time.

241
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,643
Want me to...

242
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,385
There you go.

243
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,523
Give me the cash!

244
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,494
That's a very
dangerous gun.

245
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,793
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

246
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,770
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?

247
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,000
No. Take it.
I don't need it.

248
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,880
That's a nice hat.

249
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,447
You like it?

250
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,343
God!

251
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,186
Please enter your license.

252
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,385
Yes, just a minute.

253
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,296
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.

254
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,759
Good morning.

255
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,400
Sleep well? Me too.

256
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,426
I had a horrible nightmare.

257
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,637
Propulsion 2-X-4.

258
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,605
You have five points left
on your license.

259
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,280
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

260
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,580
Have a nice day.

261
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,946
Why not?

262
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,826
You have 48 hours.

263
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,966
That's the time it needs to adapt
itself to our living conditions.

264
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,101
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

265
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,771
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

266
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,301
but to exterminate life.

267
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,008
All forms of life.

268
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,079
You're telling me
there's nothing that can stop this.

269
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,611
There is only one thing.

270
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:33,152
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil

271
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,326
Four elements...

272
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,895
gathered around a fifth...

273
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,858
supreme being,
the ultimate warrior...

274
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,898
created to protect life.

275
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,095
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."

276
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,367
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

277
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,101
But, if...

278
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,369
evil stands there...

279
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,174
Then what?

280
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,643
Then light turns to dark.

281
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,284
Life to death...

282
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,712
forever.

283
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,994
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

284
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,931
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

285
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,034
Thank you.

286
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,232
Permission to enter granted.

287
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,510
Show time.

288
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,663
We are lost.

289
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,628
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

290
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,968
Mr. Zorg's office.

291
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,369
It's Aknot.

292
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,973
I'm so glad
to hear you, Aknot.

293
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,680
The mission is accomplished.

294
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,210
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.

295
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,054
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.

296
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,788
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

297
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,486
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

298
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,629
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

299
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:56,263
Three hundred years
of waiting for nothing.

300
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,492
Go get some rest.

301
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,928
No.

302
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,063
The Mondoshawan...

303
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,934
I am their contact.

304
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,542
They will come for me.

305
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,304
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

306
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,774
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

307
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,350
Any survivors?

308
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,885
Only one.

309
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,615
You call that a survivor?

310
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,921
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

311
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,496
Have you identified it?

312
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,097
The computer went
off the charts.

313
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,132
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

314
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,862
which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

315
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,007
This has 200,000 memo groups.

316
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,012
Sounds like
a freak of nature.

317
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,214
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

318
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,690
You okay?
Over here.

319
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,994
Excuse me.

320
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,468
General, I want
to show you something.

321
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,971
This is a normal
human DNA chain.

322
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,133
You, me, anybody, right?

323
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,707
Watch this.

324
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,008
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

325
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,412
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

326
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,314
Almost like this being
was engineered.

327
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,791
Is there any danger?

328
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,984
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

329
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,154
The cell is,
for lack of a better word...

330
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,195
perfect.

331
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,435
Go ahead.

332
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,328
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

333
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,596
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.

334
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,438
Activate it.

335
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,305
Tissue processing.

336
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,047
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

337
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,658
This is the last phase.

338
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,961
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

339
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,636
That means
growing skin.

340
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,168
Wonderful

341
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,875
Reconstruction complete.

342
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,776
Remove the shield.

343
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,685
I told you.
Perfect.

344
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,433
Thermal bandages.

345
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,343
I'd...

346
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,181
like to take
a few pictures...

347
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,548
for the archives.

348
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,743
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

349
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,405
Activate the phonic detector.

350
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,254
Is that thing solid?

351
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,930
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

352
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,541
If you want out...

353
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,606
you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

354
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,995
General alert.

355
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,125
Perfect.

356
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,396
Ladder on 18.

357
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,702
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

358
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,081
This way.

359
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,390
Lady, stay calm.

360
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,085
This is the police.

361
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,393
There's nowhere
else to go.

362
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:11,524
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

363
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,270
Do you understand?

364
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,039
She doesn't.

365
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,559
I think we need
a flying unit.

366
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,961
This is the police.

367
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,436
This is the police.

368
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,312
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.

369
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,652
She has no file.

370
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,269
She dove off.

371
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,683
You just had an accident.

372
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,854
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

373
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,653
You have one point left
on your license.

374
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,317
Look out!

375
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,724
Left!

376
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,333
I can't believe it.
Shit.

377
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,641
Any survivors?

378
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,648
Hi.

379
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,477
Are you okay?

380
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,313
Boom.

381
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,951
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."

382
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,055
Big.

383
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,723
Big bada boom.

384
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,717
Bada big boom.

385
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,258
Big boom.

386
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,828
Yeah, big bada boom.

387
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,123
Bada boom.

388
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,766
Big boom.
Big bada boom.

389
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,465
You're lucky you're not dead.

390
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,235
This is a police control

391
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,240
Please keep your hands
on the wheel

392
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:13,417
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.

393
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,518
We are going
to arrest her.

394
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,313
Thank you for cooperating.

395
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,955
Sorry, honey.

396
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,023
Looks like
this is your ride.

397
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,217
Open the door.

398
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,361
Do what they say.

399
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,659
Sorry.

400
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,449
"Please...

401
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,693
help."

402
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,521
I only have one point
left on my license.

403
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,429
I need it to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul

404
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,960
You understand?

405
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,237
Can you please
open the passenger door?

406
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,300
Please...

407
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,745
help.

408
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,882
I can't.

409
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,019
I repeat...

410
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,785
open the passenger door.

411
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,689
Yeah, yeah, sure.

412
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,192
Why not?

413
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,037
Thank you
for your cooperation.

414
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,612
Help.

415
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,052
Finger's going
to kill me.

416
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,686
Emergency!
Emergency!

417
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,523
One point has
been removed.

418
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,798
Yes, I know!

419
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,903
This is so stupid.

420
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,436
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.

421
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,612
Unit 47,
we're on the way...

422
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,109
after we finish lunch.

423
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,018
Two golden menus.

424
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,784
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

425
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,218
Thank you so much.

426
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,129
And I' m definitely
too thirsty.

427
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,460
Look out!

428
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,241
We got lucky.

429
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,101
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

430
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,717
Maybe two miles.

431
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,023
Hang on.

432
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,066
Look, lady...

433
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,930
I only speak English
and bad English!

434
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,339
Run an I.D.

435
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:29,273
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

436
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,646
He's got a scan blocker.

437
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,513
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.

438
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,552
I don't know
what you did...

439
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,327
but they are pissed off!

440
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,396
Hold on!

441
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,745
We're safe for a while.

442
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,065
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

443
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,711
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

444
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,457
If we get to the fog,
we'll be okay.

445
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,587
If we make the fog.

446
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,584
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

447
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:24,083
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down if you don't mind.

448
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,100
Shit.

449
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,850
You okay?

450
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,050
Priest.

451
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,819
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

452
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,220
Vito Cornelius.

453
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,430
What?

454
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,425
Priest.

455
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,737
Yes?

456
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,604
I'm looking
for a priest.

457
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,470
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.

458
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,882
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.

459
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,951
The phone book
said he lived here.

460
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,112
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

461
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,915
Nobody does.
No file, no I.D., nothing.

462
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,116
She's got a tattoo
on this arm.

463
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,988
Tattoo?

464
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,305
Fifth...

465
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:44,968
element.

466
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,309
Finger's going
to kill me.

467
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,078
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

468
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,652
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

469
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,187
She just dropped in on me.

470
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,826
Started speaking
a bizarre language.

471
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,360
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

472
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,327
It's the ancient language...

473
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,562
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

474
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,502
He's a she.

475
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,005
You noticed that.

476
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,204
Yes.

477
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,845
- It 's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

478
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,781
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

479
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,685
But gently,
because this woman is...

480
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,188
mankind's most precious possession.

481
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,984
She is perfect.

482
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,060
Perfect.

483
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,403
More dignified.

484
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,100
Hey, lady...

485
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,573
wake up.

486
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,680
I shouldn't
have done that.

487
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,188
It was wrong
to kiss you.

488
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,986
He said
to wake you gently.

489
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,627
You're right.

490
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,033
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

491
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,761
Remember?

492
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,003
"Bada boom?"

493
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,697
"Big bada boom?"

494
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,769
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

495
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,410
I drive a cab.
This is me.

496
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,170
Korben Dallas.

497
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,582
Korben.
You understand?

498
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,084
Here.

499
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,252
Take it.

500
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,280
You can call me
when you learn English.

501
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,258
Just kidding.

502
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,196
What is your name?

503
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,930
You.

504
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,624
Korben.

505
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:57,266
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

506
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,376
Good.

507
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,370
All that's your name?

508
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,281
Do you have...

509
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,645
a shorter name?

510
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,916
Short.

511
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,285
Korben Dallas.

512
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,757
Leeloo.

513
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,058
Leeloo.

514
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,635
Korben, Leeloo.

515
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,562
Leeloo, Korben.

516
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,356
You're sure
she's a Supreme Being?

517
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,151
Absolutely sure.

518
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,827
Old friends.

519
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,257
Yeah, you're right.

520
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,258
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

521
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,793
Korben Dallas.

522
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,799
Thank you for your help.

523
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,838
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

524
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,970
She's been on
a long trip.

525
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,340
I know.
I was there when she landed.

526
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,871
Wait, wait, Father.

527
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,549
She said something
I didn't understand.

528
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,049
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?

529
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,521
"Never without my permission."

530
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,713
That's what I thought.

531
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,727
I shouldn't have
kissed her.

532
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,904
Oh, no. I' m so sorry.
I forgot your food.

533
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,878
How about some
nice Thai food?

534
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,982
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

535
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,583
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.

536
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,478
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?

537
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,586
Car's running fine.

538
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,485
Fine. What "fine"?

539
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,523
I know you.
"Fine"ain't in your vocabulary.

540
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,992
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.

541
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,461
What? You save the planet?

542
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,200
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?

543
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:10,039
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

544
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,335
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

545
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,442
How big?

546
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,684
Five-nine...

547
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,518
blue eyes...

548
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,692
long legs, great skin.

549
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,789
You know?
Perfect.

550
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,596
I see.

551
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:37,631
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?

552
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,264
Leeloo.

553
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,040
What's she doing?

554
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,216
Learning our history,
the last 5,000 years that she missed.

555
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,044
She's been asleep
for a while.

556
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,461
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

557
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,727
You're right.

558
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,670
Chicken.

559
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,067
Good.

560
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,978
Chicken.

561
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,116
I'm really sorry
to interrupt you, but...

562
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,686
the case...

563
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,747
with the stones...

564
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:35,992
where is it?

565
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,626
Stolen?

566
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,861
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

567
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,864
Excuse me, sir.

568
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,067
The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

569
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,872
Is it possible
to fire 500,000?

570
00:46:56,046 --> 00:47:00,483
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

571
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,482
Fire one million.

572
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,678
But 500,000...

573
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,858
One million.

574
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,125
Sorry to have
disturbed you.

575
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,242
It's for the Supreme...

576
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,639
Sorry.

577
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,042
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

578
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,987
You just put it like that.

579
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,483
Yes, there was
a man with a limp...

580
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,319
came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

581
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,996
Said he was an art dealer.

582
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,728
What was his name?

583
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,399
I'm bad with names.

584
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,170
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.

585
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,011
What'd she say?

586
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,124
She says she knows
exactly where they are.

587
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,563
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

588
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:24,730
Aknot, is that you?

589
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,530
What an ugly face.

590
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,068
It doesn't suit you.

591
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,363
Take it off.

592
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,869
That's better.

593
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,704
Never be ashamed
of who you are.

594
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,378
You're warriors.
Be proud.

595
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,050
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

596
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:44,320
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

597
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,354
Your time for revenge
is at hand.

598
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,983
The ZF-1.

599
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,154
It's light. The handle 's adjustable
for easy carrying.

600
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:59,824
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

601
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,005
A word on fire power:

602
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,732
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip,
with bursts of 3 to 300.

603
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,774
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

604
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,006
One shot...

605
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,982
and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

606
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,393
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

607
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,096
Rocket launcher.

608
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,357
Arrow launcher...

609
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,428
with exploding
or poisonous heads.

610
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,032
Very practical

611
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,503
Net launcher.

612
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,441
The flamethrower.

613
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:44,914
My favorite.

614
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,383
And for the grand finale...

615
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,018
the new Ice Cube System.

616
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,290
Four full crates...

617
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,964
delivered right on time.

618
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,101
And what about you,
dear Aknot?

619
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,826
Did you bring
what I asked?

620
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,833
Yes.

621
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,839
Magnificent.

622
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,175
This...

623
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,118
This case is empty.

624
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,783
Empty?

625
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:29,890
Empty...

626
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,687
the opposite of full.

627
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,198
This case
is supposed to be full!

628
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,358
Anyone care to explain?

629
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,632
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

630
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,870
Who took another route.

631
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,182
She's supposed
to contact this person...

632
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,876
in a hotel

633
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,820
And she's looking
for the address.

634
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,017
Easy.

635
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,222
Dot.

636
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,536
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

637
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,704
We're saved.

638
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:18,966
I'm screwed.

639
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,541
You asked for a case.
We brought one.

640
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,111
A case with four stones
in it!

641
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,511
Not one or two or three,
but four!

642
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,910
Four stones!

643
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,951
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

644
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,248
We are warriors,
not merchants.

645
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:36,585
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.

646
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,226
Four stones, four crates.

647
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,296
Zero stones, zero crates!

648
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,362
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

649
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,996
We risked our lives.

650
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:53,072
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

651
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,411
So you are merchants
after all.

652
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,443
Leave him one crate
for the cause.

653
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,785
I don't like warriors.

654
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,253
Narrow-minded,
no subtlety...

655
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,622
and they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

656
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,662
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasrt saved a single one.

657
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,264
I'll tell you what I do like:
A killer.

658
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,891
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold -blooded, clean and methodical

659
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,038
A real killer
picking up the ZF-1...

660
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,730
would 've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

661
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,625
Bring me the priest.

662
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,666
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

663
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,290
and a blueprint
of the hotel

664
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:55,730
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

665
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,497
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

666
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,973
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

667
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,645
There must be a way.

668
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,087
I'll get it.

669
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,056
Weddings?

670
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:17,825
Not really.

671
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,827
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?

672
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,624
Mr. Zorg.

673
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,165
Jean-Baptiste...

674
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:25,566
Emmanuel...

675
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,702
Zorg.

676
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,535
It's nice to see
you again, Father.

677
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,006
I remember you now.

678
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,104
The so-called art dealer.

679
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,383
I'm glad you got
your memory back.

680
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,381
Because you'll need it.

681
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,988
Where are the stones?

682
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:47,652
I don't know.

683
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,121
If I did, I wouldn't tell
someone like you.

684
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:51,652
Why?

685
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,761
What's wrong with me?

686
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,557
I try to serve life.

687
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,560
But you only...

688
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,368
want to destroy it.

689
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,665
Father...

690
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,440
you're so wrong.

691
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,735
Let me explain.

692
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:15,746
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction and chaos.

693
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,385
Take this empty glass.

694
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,351
Here it is, peaceful...

695
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,454
boring.

696
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,421
But if it is...

697
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,726
destroyed.

698
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,858
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

699
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,764
Notice how each is useful

700
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,708
What a lovely ballet ensues...

701
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,535
so full of form and color.

702
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:44,111
Now think of all those people
that created them.

703
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,711
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

704
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:52,820
so those children can grow up
and have children...

705
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,251
and so on.

706
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,460
Thus adding
to the great chain...

707
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,461
of life.

708
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,660
Water. Fruit.

709
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:07,464
You see, Father,
by creating a little destruction...

710
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,837
I'm encouraging life.

711
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,241
In reality,
you and I are in the same business.

712
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,111
Cheers.

713
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,487
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

714
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,225
Or the engineer?

715
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,301
Or their children, maybe?

716
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:58,445
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

717
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:02,148
How your entire empire
of destruction comes...

718
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,723
crashing down...

719
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,157
all because of one, little...

720
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,992
cherry.

721
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,972
You saved my life...

722
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,341
and in return,
I'll spare yours...

723
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,107
for now.

724
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,113
You're a monster, Zorg.

725
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,178
I know.

726
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,118
Torture who you have to,
the President, I don't care.

727
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,288
Just bring me the stones.

728
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,125
You have one hour.

729
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,374
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

730
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,212
Why is it eating up
all the satellites?

731
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,149
We're working on it.

732
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,994
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

733
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,537
And the stones?
Did you find them?

734
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,708
They werert on board.

735
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,001
What?

736
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,043
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

737
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,010
They gave them
to someone they do trust.

738
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,951
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.

739
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,418
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

740
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,351
She has the stones.

741
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:43,925
The Mondoshawans will help.

742
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,721
We must send someone...

743
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,191
to get the stones.

744
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,421
Excellent.

745
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,599
I want this operation to be
as discreet as possible.

746
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,028
No troops.
No big operation.

747
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,798
I want your best man
to go undercover.

748
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,805
I have the perfect one.

749
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,377
You've got a message.

750
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,946
Not opening it?
Could be important.

751
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:12,411
Like the last two
were important.

752
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,186
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

753
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:20,256
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

754
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,463
That is bad luck.

755
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,791
Grandfather say...

756
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,401
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.

757
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,629
I bet you lunch.

758
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,034
Okay.

759
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,270
Come on.

760
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:39,974
"You are fired."

761
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:43,578
Oh, I' m sorry.

762
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,790
At least I won lunch.

763
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,222
Good philosophy.

764
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:55,124
See good in bad.
Ilike.

765
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,026
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.

766
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,659
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?

767
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,736
Hi, Mom.

768
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:01,929
Seventeen messages.

769
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:05,563
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.

770
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:07,165
Mr. Kim,
you should go.

771
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,140
This'll take a minute.

772
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:12,178
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.

773
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,680
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.

774
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,842
Good fortune for you.

775
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,990
You don't have a girl
I'll never be a grandmother.

776
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,785
It bring you good luck!

777
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,367
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.

778
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,867
What are you
talking about?

779
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,801
You want to make me beg?

780
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,508
No, all I want
is an explanation.

781
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:40,768
I just got in.

782
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:43,844
I just smashed my cab.
Ilost my job. I got mugged.

783
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,380
Besides that,
everything's peachy.

784
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,212
Thanks for asking.

785
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,284
Now settle down
and explain this to me.

786
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,511
You don't know
you won a trip...

787
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,724
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?

788
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,520
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?

789
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,523
If I' d won a trip,
I'd know.

790
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,765
I would 've been notified.

791
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,199
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.

792
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,903
I'll call you back.

793
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,882
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

794
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,211
Nice apartment.

795
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,484
You've settled
into a wonderful life.

796
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,158
Heard you lost your job.

797
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,994
You heard that?

798
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,731
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.

799
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,924
Don't bother.
We have one for you.

800
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:40,534
"Major Dallas...

801
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,227
you've been selected
for a mission."

802
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,499
- What mission?
- To save the world.

803
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,170
"You leave
for Fhloston Paradise.

804
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:51,211
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

805
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:52,343
Any questions?

806
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,813
Why me? I retired
six months ago. Remember?

807
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,180
Three reasons.

808
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,587
One:

809
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,513
As a member
of the Elite Special Forces Unit...

810
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,955
you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

811
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,626
Two: You're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

812
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:09,794
The third?

813
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,934
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.

814
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,099
Check your messages?

815
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,794
I've had enough good news.

816
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,471
Might be important.

817
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,277
You're a winner!

818
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,743
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

819
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,315
Here are your tickets.

820
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,448
You rigged the contest?

821
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,320
Congratulations.

822
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,620
You couldn't
be more discreet?

823
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,988
Old tricks are the best tricks.

824
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,928
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

825
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,229
I am not going.

826
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:03,417
Excuse me, General

827
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,645
Who is it?

828
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,856
Who is it?

829
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:11,625
My wife.

830
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,397
Yes... no. I just met this girl,
but I' m going to marry her.

831
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,465
Ilove her,
but she hates the military.

832
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,567
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

833
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:20,896
She can't have anything
to do with it.

834
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,436
If she sees you,
she'll kill me.

835
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,263
- Major...
- You gotta hide somewhere.

836
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:25,907
You've gotta help me.

837
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,169
We'd love to,
but where can we hide?

838
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,871
We don't
have time for this.

839
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,517
It's just for one minute.

840
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,810
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

841
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,014
No idea...
You have no idea.

842
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,557
- I' m going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

843
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,923
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

844
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,691
Major!

845
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,463
You're on my foot.

846
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:51,965
Major! Major!

847
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,873
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace...

848
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:02,945
Dallas.

849
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:06,971
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

850
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,047
Is this the way
priests vacation?

851
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,913
We're on a mission.

852
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,315
What kind?

853
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,182
We have to save
the world, my son.

854
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,323
You're gonna
save the world?

855
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,154
Yes!

856
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,859
Down there.
Down there.

857
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,234
This is a police control

858
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:39,080
This is not an exercise.

859
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,782
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

860
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,920
Just stay here
for one minute.

861
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,024
- This is a police control
- Don't touch anything.

862
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,750
This is not an exercise.

863
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,488
Can you please spread your legs...

864
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,532
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.

865
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,000
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

866
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,367
Yeah, but l- -

867
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,369
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

868
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,701
Let's see it.

869
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,107
Are you classified
as human?

870
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,978
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.

871
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:19,948
I found him.

872
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,981
Mr. Korben Dallas?

873
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:26,386
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

874
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,292
Smoke you!

875
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:33,927
Wrong answer.

876
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,439
The police control
is now terminated.

877
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,801
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

878
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,846
We got the guy.
Wasrt easy but we bagged him.

879
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,314
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

880
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:52,685
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

881
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:57,087
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

882
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,761
and I' II be in Fhloston
in four hours.

883
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,528
Don't come back
without the stones.

884
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,509
We got Korben Dallas.

885
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:22,775
Perfect.

886
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,123
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.

887
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,121
LfZorg really wants them...

888
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,453
he'll have to negotiate.

889
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,187
Revenge is at hand.

890
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,833
Oh, I am so sorry.

891
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,903
I forgot
about the autowash.

892
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,340
There's an autowash
in that shower.

893
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,877
I'm so sorry.

894
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,383
Autowash.

895
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,416
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

896
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,546
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.

897
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,726
Both times
you've ended up in my arms.

898
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,158
It's my lucky day.

899
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,991
Lucky day.

900
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,876
Did you hear something?

901
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,240
Cornelius.

902
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,579
Autowash.

903
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:35,356
- I' m so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

904
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,892
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

905
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:43,928
Autowash.

906
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,898
Coffee's not my specialty.

907
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,406
But you must drink a lot
of coffee being a priest.

908
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:01,144
I know. I' m not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

909
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,995
I'll take the mission.

910
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,814
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

911
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,076
Good.

912
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,750
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

913
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,618
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.

914
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,628
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.

915
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,524
Now David is...

916
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,329
in great shape.
He'll protect you.

917
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:55,632
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

918
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,237
Now. Yes.

919
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,769
Okay.

920
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,806
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.

921
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,719
The tickets.

922
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,419
- I.D., please.
- I' m sorry.

923
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,783
- There.
- In here?

924
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,286
Mr. Dallas?

925
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,555
Congratulations on the contest.

926
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,501
Oh, right. Okay.

927
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,264
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

928
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:30,563
The garbage.

929
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,811
Made it!

930
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,473
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it...

931
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,913
so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

932
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,052
Now David must go.

933
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,049
Thank you. Bye.

934
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,990
I am Korben Dallas.

935
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,259
And this is?

936
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,594
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.

937
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,592
Multi-pass.

938
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,499
She knows
it's a multi-pass.

939
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,596
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.

940
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,436
Bump into each other, sparks happen...
She knows.

941
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,077
Anyway, we're in love.

942
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,442
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

943
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,949
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

944
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,426
- You want more?
- Yeah.

945
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,954
Make that two.

946
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:32,964
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

947
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:34,365
What!

948
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,094
I didn't know
what to do.

949
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,973
But this is not possible.

950
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,008
This is not possible.

951
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,542
You want some more?

952
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,043
This is all my fault.

953
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,582
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

954
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,717
I know.

955
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,520
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

956
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,589
Prepare for our arrival
I go to face my destiny.

957
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,820
I don't want
to go to Egypt.

958
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,724
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?

959
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:08,970
That's me.

960
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,135
Just a minute, please.

961
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,140
It will just take
one more minute.

962
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:31,159
We'll be right back.

963
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,424
Mr. Dallas...

964
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,361
we really need you now.

965
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,695
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and needs to interview you.

966
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,062
Multi-pass.

967
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,079
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

968
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,708
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.

969
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,953
Backup unit, zone 18.

970
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:21,102
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.

971
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,242
He's so green.

972
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,603
I'm sure you're excited.

973
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,781
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

974
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,907
I prefer to remain anonymous.

975
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,216
Korben Dallas!

976
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:38,654
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

977
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,592
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

978
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,323
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

979
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:51,239
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

980
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,667
Right on.

981
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,943
And he's got
something to say...

982
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,510
to those 50 billion pairs of ears
out there.

983
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,341
Pop it, D-man.

984
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,352
Hi.

985
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,788
Unbelievable.

986
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:11,955
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.

987
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,458
Right here
from five to seven.

988
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:17,154
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

989
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,832
His dreams...

990
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,263
his desires...

991
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,164
his most intimates of intimates.

992
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,169
And from what I' m looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

993
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,171
So tell me, my man...

994
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,843
you nervous in the service?

995
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:34,272
Not really.

996
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,646
Freeze those knees 'cause Korbers
in the place and he's on the case.

997
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,756
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's Prince...

998
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,120
of Fhloston Paradise!

999
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,496
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

1000
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,131
A magic fountain flowing
with nonstop wine, women and...

1001
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,028
hootchie-kootchie-koo...

1002
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,825
all night long.

1003
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:58,031
All night long
All night

1004
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:08,741
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

1005
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,920
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.

1006
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:16,319
On the trail of the sexiest
man of the year: D-man, your man...

1007
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,856
End of transmission.

1008
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,761
See you tomorrow at five.

1009
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,036
How was it?

1010
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,941
It was just absolutely green.

1011
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,543
Green like what?

1012
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,775
Crystal green.

1013
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,939
Any kind of green
you want...

1014
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,979
tree green, emerald,
pond green.

1015
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,964
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

1016
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,730
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

1017
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,295
It must pop, pop, pop!

1018
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,896
So tomorrow, from five to seven...

1019
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,306
please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

1020
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:12,372
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

1021
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,783
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

1022
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:19,114
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

1023
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:22,256
Tomorrow, from five to seven,
you'll give yourself a hand.

1024
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,655
Green?

1025
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:25,053
Super green.

1026
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,756
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

1027
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,124
That's me.

1028
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:34,497
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

1029
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,672
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

1030
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,604
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.

1031
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,510
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

1032
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,613
I need to talk
to someone!

1033
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,514
I don't believe this!

1034
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,786
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control

1035
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,085
I'm sorry. I' m calm.

1036
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,420
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

1037
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,061
To make your flight short...

1038
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,367
flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

1039
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,464
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

1040
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:14,968
Thank you.

1041
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:19,411
Hi.

1042
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,209
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.

1043
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,545
Good.

1044
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,150
We are not on vacation.

1045
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,847
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

1046
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,994
If I hadrt come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

1047
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,219
Understand?

1048
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:35,487
Yes.

1049
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,699
But you, no trouble.

1050
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,927
Me, Fifth Element.

1051
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,637
Supreme Being.

1052
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,498
Me protect you.

1053
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,012
Sleep.

1054
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,050
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.

1055
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,621
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

1056
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:03,791
Thank you.

1057
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,084
Are you operative?

1058
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,021
Zone two?

1059
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,421
Everything's ready, Captain.

1060
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:10,530
What?

1061
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,791
Assume your
individual position.

1062
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,798
But I want all positions!

1063
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,366
Mr. Rhod...

1064
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,670
Parasites in landing gear.

1065
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:21,800
Ground, copy?

1066
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:23,500
Got it.
Front gear.

1067
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,375
Hey, man,
give me some heat, man!

1068
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:30,210
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!

1069
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,551
Some heat over here, man!

1070
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:36,917
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!

1071
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,065
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

1072
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:59,307
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

1073
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,777
Take that.

1074
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,353
Mr. Rhod!

1075
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,248
You can call me Ruby.

1076
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,484
Fueled and ready to go.

1077
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,028
I'll buy you one.

1078
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:19,964
Taken off already?

1079
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,269
I'm not on the plane.

1080
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:23,836
What?

1081
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,701
The real Dallas
took my place.

1082
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,306
I don't understand.

1083
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,966
Are you making fun of me?

1084
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,271
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!

1085
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,506
I never felt this way before
with a human.

1086
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,717
Really?

1087
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,719
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.

1088
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:50,889
Ground is clear.

1089
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,624
Ready for liftoff?

1090
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,028
Confirmed.

1091
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:02,741
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

1092
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,536
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

1093
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:10,708
- Protection?
- Confirmed

1094
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,910
Power increase.

1095
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,187
Ten seconds.

1096
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,846
I am...

1097
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:17,751
a little...

1098
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:19,853
disappointed.

1099
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:20,653
5...

1100
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:23,387
If there is one thing
I do not like...

1101
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:24,223
3...

1102
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:25,991
it is to be...

1103
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:26,860
2...

1104
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,003
disappointed.

1105
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:29,863
1...

1106
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,006
Sorry, it will
never happen again.

1107
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:33,373
I know.

1108
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,509
Liftoff.

1109
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:49,090
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.

1110
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,552
We're finally
getting something.

1111
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:20,086
It's sending
radio wavelengths.

1112
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:21,979
What does it want
with radio waves?

1113
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,221
Maybe it wants
to make a call.

1114
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,057
Zorg's office.

1115
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,464
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

1116
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:36,728
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1117
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,633
and Mr. Shadow's
on the line.

1118
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,585
It's Shadow again.

1119
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:52,486
Zorg here.

1120
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,985
Am I disturbing you?

1121
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,420
No, no, I was just...

1122
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:00,988
Where are you?

1123
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:03,960
Not far now.

1124
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,491
Good.

1125
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:08,635
Good, good.

1126
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:13,240
How are the stones?

1127
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,970
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.

1128
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:21,148
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

1129
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,011
but it wasrt easy.

1130
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,652
My costs have tripled.

1131
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:29,615
Money is of no...

1132
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,326
importance.

1133
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,128
I...

1134
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,588
want...

1135
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,900
the stones.

1136
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,433
The stones...

1137
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,467
will be here.

1138
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,205
I'll see to it
personally.

1139
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,868
I will be among you...

1140
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:53,809
soon.

1141
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,652
We lost it.

1142
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,384
We lost the signal

1143
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:00,555
Damn!

1144
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,735
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.

1145
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,945
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.

1146
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:27,843
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahreneit.

1147
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:31,985
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.

1148
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,968
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.

1149
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,381
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

1150
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:43,991
Parasites in the main ventilation.

1151
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,820
Again?
I'll get it.

1152
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,500
Have we arrived yet?

1153
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,472
Oh, good.

1154
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,943
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1155
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,170
All the restaurants
are between levels two and ten.

1156
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:10,442
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p. M...

1157
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,347
then the airship goes higher...

1158
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,112
to offer you a better view.

1159
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:15,617
Is the Diva here?

1160
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,950
Not yet.

1161
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,682
Any tickets left
for the opera?

1162
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:21,661
You have a seat reserved,
front row...

1163
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,888
next to Ruby Rhod!

1164
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:27,159
He's so talented.
Ilove him. He's so sexy.

1165
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,736
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

1166
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:34,241
Where can I get
something to wear?

1167
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:40,479
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1168
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,689
You miserable bastard,
I never should 've pushed you out.

1169
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:54,760
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?

1170
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:56,521
I should 've gotten
a robot.

1171
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,291
Come on, Ma.

1172
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,759
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.

1173
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,527
I need a cocktail

1174
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:26,558
Get the case in.

1175
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,327
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.

1176
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,833
Welcome to the...
I'm security.

1177
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,871
Welcome to the...

1178
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,269
Tall.

1179
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,855
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

1180
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,928
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1181
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:07,429
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you are here.

1182
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:10,604
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1183
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:18,207
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.

1184
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,415
Helm to 108.

1185
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:24,417
Helm 108!

1186
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:25,712
Helm to 108.

1187
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,386
Time to join Ruby Rhod...

1188
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,458
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...

1189
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:35,026
of the Gemini Croquette contest.

1190
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:38,391
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...

1191
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:39,960
Paradise!

1192
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:44,969
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

1193
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,971
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1194
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,235
and 8,000 other lucksters here...

1195
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:55,246
to enjoy the privilege of
the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1196
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,916
Now we enter what must be...

1197
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:03,751
the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

1198
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:07,985
A perfect replica
of an old opera house...

1199
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,122
but who cares?

1200
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,968
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1201
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:17,663
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1202
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,602
He's not going to get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

1203
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:22,942
To who?

1204
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:26,944
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1205
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:30,676
The Emperor of KodarJaphet
and his lovely daughter.

1206
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,979
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1207
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:37,521
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1208
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,561
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

1209
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,425
for Korben to say
the word of the day.

1210
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:48,967
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

1211
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:52,870
Thrilled.

1212
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,739
And now...

1213
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:56,810
champagne!

1214
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,181
Commercial
Commercial

1215
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,020
Break for 30 seconds.

1216
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:24,967
Show time.

1217
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:20,948
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

1218
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:23,955
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

1219
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:27,256
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.

1220
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,471
Champagne for the Diva.

1221
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,279
I'll take it.

1222
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,516
I found it.

1223
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:58,352
Get her!

1224
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,013
It was an ambush.

1225
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,448
If it's war they want...

1226
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:41,814
it's war they'll get!

1227
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,723
Bravo! Bravo!

1228
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:48,988
Bravo! Bravo!

1229
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:50,824
My compliments, little lady.

1230
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:52,365
Thank you for doing
the dirty work.

1231
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:55,435
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

1232
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,298
Hand over the stones.

1233
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:39,940
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

1234
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:45,348
Hands up!

1235
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:55,846
I know this music.

1236
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:00,251
Let's change the beat.

1237
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:08,926
I think we're
being attacked.

1238
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:10,400
They're everywhere.

1239
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:13,664
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.

1240
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:17,105
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.

1241
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,178
Mangalores.

1242
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:23,413
The government
sent me to help you.

1243
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:25,209
If somebody hears this,
come and get me.

1244
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:27,783
I'm in the first row.

1245
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:31,416
You must give her the stones.

1246
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:32,526
Who?

1247
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,250
The Fifth Element.

1248
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:38,894
The Supreme Being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1249
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:40,033
Leeloo?

1250
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:45,803
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

1251
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:48,366
She needs your help...

1252
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,371
and your love...

1253
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,269
or...

1254
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,810
she will die.

1255
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,047
Stay with me.

1256
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,448
Help!

1257
01:36:08,662 --> 01:36:10,823
If you want
something done...

1258
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,926
do it yourself.

1259
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,626
Come on, honey.
You can't die.

1260
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:17,963
Wake up!
Where are the stones?

1261
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,473
Where are the stones?

1262
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:22,837
The stones.

1263
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,421
They're not here.

1264
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:40,854
The stones,
where are they?

1265
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:44,497
In me.

1266
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:45,866
What?

1267
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,337
Oh, my God, Korben.

1268
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,169
Korben, another one coming.

1269
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:59,039
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

1270
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:00,113
Hey, you!

1271
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:03,183
I said you.

1272
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:05,114
- I' m not with him.
- Where's the other?

1273
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,622
I said, "one minute."

1274
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:11,347
Ruby, hold this gun.

1275
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,026
What do you
want me to do?

1276
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,127
Come on.

1277
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:15,719
Put your hand
on it.

1278
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:18,194
- What do I do?
- Lfhe moves, squeeze the trigger.

1279
01:37:18,933 --> 01:37:20,798
I don't feel right.

1280
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:24,300
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

1281
01:37:33,948 --> 01:37:36,212
I got a headache.
This ain't me.

1282
01:37:54,768 --> 01:37:55,928
Sorry.

1283
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:58,329
Think he'll be okay?

1284
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,346
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1285
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:12,783
Shit. Three coming.

1286
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,747
You guard this
with your life...

1287
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:19,960
or you'll look like him.
You green?

1288
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:21,094
Green.

1289
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:22,523
Super green?

1290
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,096
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

1291
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:29,099
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1292
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,988
Move! Move!

1293
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:01,192
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1294
01:39:01,335 --> 01:39:02,393
Ladies and gentlemen...

1295
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:04,061
this is amazing.

1296
01:39:06,173 --> 01:39:07,731
Let me do it.

1297
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:16,073
Oh, my God.

1298
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:26,159
The gun!

1299
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:29,928
Give me the gun.

1300
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:31,256
I'm going to go...

1301
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:35,663
and try to see if I can see
something a little closer.

1302
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,014
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1303
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:04,364
Thanks, Ray.

1304
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:08,961
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

1305
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,170
Get up!

1306
01:40:10,371 --> 01:40:12,737
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

1307
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:14,237
I'm not armed.

1308
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:18,912
Oh, my God.

1309
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,705
I'm on vacation.

1310
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:23,174
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.

1311
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:24,341
I won a...

1312
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,246
contest.

1313
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:29,422
Gemini Croquette's to...

1314
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:30,988
Fhloston Paradise.

1315
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,227
Down.

1316
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:37,924
Wait a minute.

1317
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:39,327
Get down!

1318
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:42,560
He's trying
to say something.

1319
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:43,567
Down!

1320
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,279
Sorry, my man.

1321
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:09,954
Where are you?

1322
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,629
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1323
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:16,295
They're coming.
They're coming.

1324
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:21,398
Don't move.

1325
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:33,745
What you doing?

1326
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:35,478
Count to ten.

1327
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:46,264
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

1328
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:48,763
3! 4! 5!

1329
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:51,171
7, 8...

1330
01:41:52,306 --> 01:41:53,671
9...

1331
01:42:17,898 --> 01:42:19,092
10.

1332
01:42:25,172 --> 01:42:26,537
I am...

1333
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:29,004
very disappointed.

1334
01:42:29,676 --> 01:42:31,871
Korben, what are you
looking for?

1335
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:33,205
Control room.

1336
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:36,710
- This is it.
- I' II be here.

1337
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,182
Let's go.

1338
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:43,222
Quiet! Quiet!

1339
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:46,020
You in charge?

1340
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,728
How many
are out there?

1341
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:51,490
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1342
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,027
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

1343
01:43:03,544 --> 01:43:05,512
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

1344
01:43:06,813 --> 01:43:09,543
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

1345
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,517
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

1346
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,746
That's the leader.

1347
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:16,752
Send someone to negotiate.

1348
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:21,258
I've never negotiated.

1349
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:23,427
You mind if I try?

1350
01:43:25,566 --> 01:43:28,000
We're sending
somebody to negotiate.

1351
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:39,002
Anybody else
want to negotiate?

1352
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:41,874
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1353
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:43,713
I wonder.

1354
01:43:48,288 --> 01:43:49,585
Where's Ruby?

1355
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:52,024
I thought he was dead.

1356
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:53,191
Master!

1357
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:56,452
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

1358
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,464
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1359
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:01,031
still alive.

1360
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:03,097
What's wrong with you?

1361
01:44:03,203 --> 01:44:04,465
It hurt!

1362
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:14,210
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1363
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:16,814
but I' m fighting
for a noble cause.

1364
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:19,815
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1365
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:22,319
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.

1366
01:44:22,522 --> 01:44:23,580
Leeloo's in trouble?

1367
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:25,815
When is Leeloo
not in trouble?

1368
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,827
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.

1369
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,334
Hang on.

1370
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:38,962
Here, come on.

1371
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:40,974
How do you get yourself
into these positions?

1372
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:43,437
Come on.

1373
01:44:46,713 --> 01:44:49,682
I'm here. It 's all right.
Everything's okay now.

1374
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,141
Listen.

1375
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,789
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

1376
01:44:59,493 --> 01:45:03,361
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

1377
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:14,999
If it was a bomb...

1378
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:19,474
the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

1379
01:45:21,415 --> 01:45:21,548
This is a type "A"alert.

1380
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:24,108
This is a type "A"alert.

1381
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:27,276
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.

1382
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:30,180
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...

1383
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:31,891
Stay calm!

1384
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:33,550
...located in the main hallways.

1385
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:34,888
Stay calm!

1386
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,194
You know how to stop this,
right?

1387
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:52,207
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.

1388
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,214
Get back!

1389
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:57,041
Evacuation!
Evacuation!

1390
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:00,583
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel

1391
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:06,685
I know.

1392
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,073
I don't want to die.

1393
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:24,438
Please, my son.

1394
01:46:25,078 --> 01:46:26,409
Get in.

1395
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:33,981
One minute to total evacuation.

1396
01:46:38,792 --> 01:46:39,759
This one.

1397
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:44,960
45 seconds.

1398
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:49,826
Get her strapped in.

1399
01:46:55,475 --> 01:46:57,602
You know how to fly this?

1400
01:46:57,811 --> 01:46:58,971
Like driving a cab.

1401
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:05,617
How will we
get out the door?

1402
01:47:19,132 --> 01:47:20,963
15 seconds.

1403
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:26,865
10...

1404
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,530
9, 8...

1405
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:30,869
7...

1406
01:47:31,211 --> 01:47:32,644
6...

1407
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:33,870
5.

1408
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:52,562
For the honor.

1409
01:47:58,605 --> 01:47:59,572
Hold on.

1410
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:23,156
Like driving a cab.

1411
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:27,860
It is now 7 p.m.,
time for the news.

1412
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:29,934
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1413
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,997
End of transmission.

1414
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:34,941
That's the best show
I ever did.

1415
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:40,607
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1416
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:43,544
and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

1417
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:49,418
We're saved.

1418
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:08,266
The Diva said
I should take care of you.

1419
01:49:09,409 --> 01:49:11,969
Humans act so strange.

1420
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:13,271
What do you mean?

1421
01:49:15,015 --> 01:49:17,040
Everything you created...

1422
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:18,845
is used to destroy.

1423
01:49:21,087 --> 01:49:22,577
We call it human nature.

1424
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:24,757
You learn that
on your screen?

1425
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:27,756
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."

1426
01:49:28,628 --> 01:49:29,925
"V" is good.

1427
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:32,230
Some good words in "V."

1428
01:49:32,332 --> 01:49:33,663
Like what?

1429
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:37,299
"Valiant."

1430
01:49:37,871 --> 01:49:39,133
"Vulnerable."

1431
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:43,233
"Very beautiful"

1432
01:49:55,021 --> 01:49:57,489
Oh, of course, Munro!

1433
01:49:58,892 --> 01:49:59,950
Mr. President?

1434
01:50:00,193 --> 01:50:01,319
Now what?

1435
01:50:04,731 --> 01:50:06,096
We have a problem.

1436
01:50:11,671 --> 01:50:12,968
It's advancing?

1437
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:16,700
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

1438
01:50:21,214 --> 01:50:24,513
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1439
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:34,292
Korben, there's
a general on the phone.

1440
01:50:35,161 --> 01:50:36,719
I'll give you
the President.

1441
01:50:37,998 --> 01:50:40,899
Major Dallas, I first
would like to salute a warrior.

1442
01:50:41,334 --> 01:50:43,461
You're a shining example
of this army.

1443
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:45,398
In the name
of the Federation...

1444
01:50:45,505 --> 01:50:47,530
Any idea when you'll
get to the point?

1445
01:50:51,244 --> 01:50:54,736
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
heading straight for earth...

1446
01:50:54,948 --> 01:50:58,213
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.

1447
01:51:01,588 --> 01:51:03,055
How much time do we have?

1448
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:07,548
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1449
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:10,696
I'll call you back
in two hours.

1450
01:51:10,897 --> 01:51:11,989
Hello?

1451
01:52:23,436 --> 01:52:25,370
They just landed
in the desert.

1452
01:52:27,707 --> 01:52:29,334
Good job, David.

1453
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:33,239
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

1454
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,851
You got it figured out, Father?

1455
01:52:42,956 --> 01:52:45,516
This one should be fire.

1456
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:47,952
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

1457
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:51,256
The four stones
should go around.

1458
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,524
The Fifth Element should be
in the middle...

1459
01:52:53,633 --> 01:52:56,431
and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1460
01:52:57,137 --> 01:52:59,196
You've never seen this work?

1461
01:52:59,472 --> 01:53:00,439
Give me that.

1462
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:04,041
Every weapon has a manual
I'm sure this has one too.

1463
01:53:12,418 --> 01:53:13,544
That's it.
That's it.

1464
01:53:13,853 --> 01:53:15,150
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!

1465
01:53:16,856 --> 01:53:17,914
Wind.

1466
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:21,818
My man, what you doing?

1467
01:53:25,098 --> 01:53:26,929
Trying to keep you
in the D.J. Business.

1468
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:31,637
Fire.

1469
01:53:33,339 --> 01:53:34,237
Done.

1470
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,464
What happens?

1471
01:53:35,675 --> 01:53:38,235
So, now,
we have to open them.

1472
01:53:39,379 --> 01:53:41,347
And you know how to do that.
Right?

1473
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:42,744
Theoretically...

1474
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:45,575
No.

1475
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:52,083
Leeloo, honey, wake up.

1476
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:53,486
You have to help us.

1477
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:56,159
How do you open the stones?

1478
01:53:57,463 --> 01:53:59,328
Wind blows.

1479
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,424
Fire burns.

1480
01:54:02,635 --> 01:54:05,968
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1481
01:54:06,306 --> 01:54:07,500
Rain...

1482
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,341
falls.

1483
01:54:18,952 --> 01:54:20,214
What does it mean?

1484
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:23,352
I think that...

1485
01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:24,682
Maybe it's a charade.

1486
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:26,355
A game or something.

1487
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:29,284
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

1488
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,023
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1489
01:54:43,676 --> 01:54:44,973
Too late.

1490
01:54:46,746 --> 01:54:48,373
We've lost contact with them.

1491
01:54:48,581 --> 01:54:49,912
Three minutes.

1492
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:52,714
I think mine is broken.

1493
01:54:52,819 --> 01:54:54,377
Why I gotta get
the broke one?

1494
01:55:02,962 --> 01:55:04,554
We're never gonna make it.

1495
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:12,067
It moved.

1496
01:55:13,273 --> 01:55:15,741
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

1497
01:55:15,975 --> 01:55:17,408
Shut up, shut up!

1498
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:23,011
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.

1499
01:55:23,116 --> 01:55:27,416
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said...

1500
01:55:28,388 --> 01:55:29,855
"We're not going to make it."

1501
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:33,185
And that's it?

1502
01:55:42,001 --> 01:55:43,263
Korben, my man.

1503
01:55:44,003 --> 01:55:44,970
Wind.

1504
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:48,100
She said, "Wind blows."

1505
01:55:56,082 --> 01:55:57,549
Everyone take a stone.

1506
01:55:57,917 --> 01:56:00,784
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

1507
01:56:03,256 --> 01:56:04,382
Earth.

1508
01:56:04,657 --> 01:56:06,124
Open the other one.

1509
01:56:22,008 --> 01:56:24,408
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.

1510
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:26,737
I have no matches.
Do you have any?

1511
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:29,312
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?

1512
01:56:29,515 --> 01:56:32,143
Got some matches?
We need some fire.

1513
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:35,144
We're going to die.

1514
01:56:42,462 --> 01:56:43,861
Don't breathe.

1515
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:06,042
One minute.

1516
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:07,814
Let's go, Leeloo.

1517
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:10,981
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1518
01:57:11,724 --> 01:57:13,214
Protect life...

1519
01:57:14,494 --> 01:57:15,722
until death.

1520
01:57:15,895 --> 01:57:17,055
Listen to me!

1521
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:18,720
Listen to me.

1522
01:57:18,898 --> 01:57:21,560
Listen,
I know you're very tired.

1523
01:57:21,734 --> 01:57:25,465
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

1524
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:27,330
But if you don't
do something right now...

1525
01:57:27,507 --> 01:57:29,065
we'll all die.

1526
01:57:29,242 --> 01:57:32,905
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1527
01:57:33,246 --> 01:57:35,908
It'll enter the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1528
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:38,908
You're right.
You're right.

1529
01:57:39,085 --> 01:57:41,246
There are some things...

1530
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:43,753
very nice things won'th saving:
Beautiful things.

1531
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:45,987
Beautiful things.

1532
01:57:47,093 --> 01:57:48,583
Like love?

1533
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:50,787
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.

1534
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:53,264
That's a good example.
Love is won'th saving.

1535
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,963
I don't know love.

1536
01:57:58,004 --> 01:57:59,301
I don't know love.

1537
01:57:59,472 --> 01:58:01,804
I was built to protect,
not love.

1538
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:04,806
So there's no use for me
other than this.

1539
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:06,979
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1540
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:09,308
I need you.

1541
01:58:09,482 --> 01:58:11,143
I need you,
very much.

1542
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:14,011
Why?

1543
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:17,319
Because...

1544
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:19,022
because...

1545
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:21,987
Tell her, Korben.

1546
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:25,320
Tell me.

1547
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:30,502
Because...

1548
01:58:30,837 --> 01:58:32,168
Tell me.

1549
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:35,774
- Tell me.
- Because l- -

1550
01:58:36,008 --> 01:58:37,498
Because I love you.

1551
01:58:38,778 --> 01:58:40,040
Ilove you.

1552
01:58:45,017 --> 01:58:45,984
9...

1553
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:49,986
6, 5...

1554
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:52,185
4, 3...

1555
01:59:32,965 --> 01:59:37,095
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.

1556
01:59:37,837 --> 01:59:40,567
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

1557
01:59:53,419 --> 01:59:55,649
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?

1558
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:58,323
Every five minutes
it's a bomb or something.

1559
01:59:58,491 --> 01:59:59,822
I'm leaving.

1560
02:00:14,407 --> 02:00:15,738
Mr. President.

1561
02:00:15,808 --> 02:00:18,572
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the center.

1562
02:00:18,778 --> 02:00:20,575
It's an honor, Mr. President.

1563
02:00:20,646 --> 02:00:22,443
Where are my two heroes?

1564
02:00:22,515 --> 02:00:26,349
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

1565
02:00:26,519 --> 02:00:28,419
I have 19 meetings after this.

1566
02:00:28,588 --> 02:00:30,988
Let me see
if they're revived.

1567
02:00:31,157 --> 02:00:32,249
Thank you.

1568
02:00:32,525 --> 02:00:34,857
We go live in one minute.

1569
02:00:42,935 --> 02:00:43,993
They're...

1570
02:00:45,705 --> 02:00:46,933
not ready.

1571
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:48,998
They need...

1572
02:00:49,175 --> 02:00:50,437
five more minutes.

1573
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:51,941
You have 20 seconds.

1574
02:00:52,078 --> 02:00:54,273
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.

1575
02:00:55,615 --> 02:00:57,276
Some woman.
Claims to be Korbers mother.

1576
02:00:57,450 --> 02:00:58,610
Give it here.

1577
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:02,447
Mrs. Dallas,
this is the President.

1578
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:04,453
On behalf
of the Federation...

1579
02:01:04,624 --> 02:01:06,455
That doesn't
even sound like him.

1580
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:09,026
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.

1581
02:01:09,061 --> 02:01:10,756
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...

1582
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:12,422
just avoid me as usual

1583
02:01:12,498 --> 02:01:16,195
I'll throw myselfin traffic.
I'll Saran Wrap myselfto the bed.
