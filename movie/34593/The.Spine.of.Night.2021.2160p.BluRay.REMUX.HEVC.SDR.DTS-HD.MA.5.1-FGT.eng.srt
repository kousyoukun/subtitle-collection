1
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,630
Oh, daughter of man.

2
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,550
The bloom is the last light of the gods.

3
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,130
Would you die to take it?

4
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,170
I've not come in violence, guardian.

5
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,970
Like those before, you came here seeking.

6
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,570
Turn from this place. Take flight.

7
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,940
The bloom weakens, guardian. You must see that.

8
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,690
No one has braved the mountain for an eon,

9
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,030
and now you come offering me knowledge.

10
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,550
Go before I cut you down.

11
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,330
The bloom has spread?

12
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,950
How?

13
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,040
In dreams and in flames,

14
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,370
I have seen a single spore of your bloom

15
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,340
carried on the winds down from this mountain,

16
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,010
through the tall trees

17
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,470
to at last take root

18
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,010
in another of man's hidden places.

19
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,070
I have come from that place to find you

20
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,560
to put an end to your long vigil.

21
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,430
But there are things, so many things,

22
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,270
that man cannot know,

23
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,970
must not see, our dreams are.

24
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,650
The night you came here has fallen into myth.

25
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,330
Scholars have called it the night of a thousand suns.

26
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,620
But I dreamed the bloom's dream,

27
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,540
and it led me here.

28
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,040
The journey was long...

29
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,420
Painful.

30
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,170
I regret only...

31
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,630
That it has taken me so very long to find you.

32
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,170
Time has had little meaning on this mountain,

33
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,050
but your arrival on the same dawn

34
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,640
that the bloom withered cannot be mere coincidence.

35
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,350
What has changed in the world below?

36
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,310
My home was the great swamp of bastal.

37
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,730
Though the men who came called it the all sorrow.

38
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,490
It stretched from horizon to horizon,

39
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,170
and I, tzod,

40
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,070
was both its servant

41
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,050
and its queen.

42
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,140
This fame is the bastal among us.

43
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,220
It is the mouth of the swamp.

44
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,860
It is the eye of the swamp.

45
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,650
Stare!

46
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,530
Stare into our mother!

47
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,960
And she will stare back!

48
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,400
Invaders!

49
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,570
Destroy the wretches!

50
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,700
Spare the witch.

51
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,920
Bind her.

52
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,720
Bring her with us.

53
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,200
You took me from mothers swamp to serve this place?

54
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,290
I took you from mother swamp to die in this place.

55
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,050
Welcome to civilization,

56
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,770
where the fearful and ignorant toil.

57
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,510
And the foolish delight

58
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,260
in delusions of power.

59
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,270
And the...

60
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,560
The only...

61
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,020
Scent on the wind is human shit.

62
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,190
Why? Why bring me here?!

63
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,500
We all have masters to serve.

64
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,240
Halt, outsider.

65
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,970
What brings you to the mighty city of pyr?

66
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,920
The lord pyrantin, son of uxon,

67
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,370
has requested the presence of a scholar

68
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,990
from the pantheon ashurban

69
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,420
to witness and record the rise of your path...

70
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,830
Mighty city.

71
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,920
I am that scholar.

72
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,790
I'm called ghal-sur.

73
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,640
Announce me.

74
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,210
Go on, then.

75
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,370
Announce yourself.

76
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,770
Worm's cock.

77
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,430
The last wagon is lost.

78
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,060
Who knows when the next will come.

79
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,730
I heard they slaughtered them all.

80
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,660
I hope it's true.

81
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,740
Lord pyrantin. Ghal-sur at your service.

82
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,290
Tell me, ghal-sur,

83
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,590
how close is my city to your hallowed border?

84
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,100
Why, it's no more than a day's ride.

85
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,840
Precisely!

86
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,770
And yet...

87
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,010
It has taken a full season

88
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,140
to send even a single scholar

89
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,060
to Mark my historic

90
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,970
achievements.

91
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,060
Why?

92
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,730
Apologies, lord.

93
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,610
Your father's empire expands quickly and the...

94
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,360
Forget what my father has done.

95
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,370
He's half a world away from here.

96
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:32,330
This city will be the very tip of the empire's spear

97
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,830
into this savage land,

98
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,670
and you are all too blind to see it.

99
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,590
I can only apologize so much.

100
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,900
Stifle your apologies.

101
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,010
Despite your...

102
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,730
Sloth...

103
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,070
You have managed to arrive on a momentous day,

104
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,610
for we have finally brought an end

105
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,820
to the wretched mud folk who have plagued our progress

106
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,740
since we broke ground.

107
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,370
Sit.

108
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,200
Sit, scholar!

109
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,960
Take note of how a true ruler manages an empire.

110
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,020
Bring her in!

111
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,530
As you commanded,

112
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,120
we brought you the swamp witch to kneel before you, pyrantin.

113
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,460
Lord pyrantin, mongrel. Lord.

114
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,050
You wouldn't be lord of anything without...

115
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,970
Don't resist.

116
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,920
It'll only make it worse.

117
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,610
So tell me, witch...

118
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,570
What makes you so special that your savages

119
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,310
have named you queen of a bog

120
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,190
as wretched as the all sorrow.

121
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,150
The name of the great swamp is bastal!

122
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,030
She brings no sorrow to those who love her.

123
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,510
"Love her."

124
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm going to spread her open and take what I want from her.

125
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,290
She will know sorrow...

126
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,870
Just as your damnable savages did

127
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,760
as they lay bleeding

128
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,010
in your fetid muck.

129
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,970
A fate you'll wish you...

130
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,890
Had enjoyed.

131
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,950
Lay her out.

132
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,740
Record every crack of my whip, scholar.

133
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,740
Before you take your pleasure...

134
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,740
Lord...

135
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,470
I should have you know,

136
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,750
while we were lying in wait,

137
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,830
she put on quite a show,

138
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,710
filled the sky with blue flames.

139
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,420
Well...

140
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,770
Show us your swamp trickery, witch.

141
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,860
Perhaps I'll ease your suffering.

142
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,450
What does it mean, witch?

143
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,360
No!

144
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,860
This woman is protected by the high order of ashur,

145
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,570
scholars of the pantheon ashurban.

146
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,030
I will not let you harm her.

147
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,170
You librarians have no authority here, whelp.

148
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,920
I hope you'll remember that

149
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,210
when the snows come, your larders empty,

150
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,960
and you're killing each other for a mouth full of frog meat.

151
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,870
You'll be begging at the pantheon's gate for bone meal.

152
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,100
You'll be lucky to get even that unless the two of us

153
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,420
walk out of here unharmed.

154
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,930
Drag him to the cells.

155
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,270
Maybe we'll get lucky.

156
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,370
She'll tear his heart out for her swamp magic.

157
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,790
Argh! Don't leave me here!

158
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,430
The order will hear of this!

159
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,560
Careful, you fools.

160
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,690
I am in pain!

161
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,150
Bring me more wine!

162
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,230
You knew, mongrel.

163
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,110
You knew she would try something,

164
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,160
and you let her do it.

165
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,320
Nonsense, lord.

166
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,710
Careful! Careful!

167
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,540
You will be in my service

168
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,830
until the end of your days.

169
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,220
Or yours... lord.

170
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,610
In the tomes of times past, I could be lost.

171
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,140
How?

172
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,230
Oh, you cretins.

173
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,700
Oh, you...

174
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,110
He will kill us, you know?

175
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,540
Then we'll die.

176
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,940
I don't want to die!

177
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,470
Say something.

178
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,770
Who were you before you joined this ashur?

179
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,010
I was nobody.

180
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,420
An ignorant peasant boy

181
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,050
till the ashur opened their books to me.

182
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,510
They've amassed all the knowledge of the world...

183
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,770
To what end do you seek?

184
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,670
-I...    -You.

185
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,570
I don't know.

186
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,060
Then think on that before you die.

187
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,170
You gave me a face to sew fear into my subjects.

188
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,570
My father always taught me

189
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,110
to repay kindness in the like.

190
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,650
You burned my face.

191
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,650
I...

192
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,340
burned your swamp.

193
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,450
Take a look.

194
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,400
Oh!

195
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,650
Enjoy the view.

196
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,920
Your swamp burns.

197
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,830
Free us.

198
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,550
It healed me.

199
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,050
Can it do more?

200
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,720
It is power, yes?

201
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,620
Use it.

202
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,470
Come! We must flee!

203
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,360
The pantheon will protect us.

204
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,320
No! She is my mother.

205
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,770
Don't be a fool.

206
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,370
Let survival be your revenge.

207
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,930
Ride them down!

208
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,370
Die, scholar!

209
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,010
No. No!

210
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,550
I-I can stop them. It... it's not too late.

211
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,030
I-I... it's not too late.

212
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,640
Oh, please stop!

213
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,350
Please!

214
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
No.

215
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,820
Stop!

216
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,470
Please stop.

217
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,570
Father will hear of this.

218
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,920
He will revenge me.

219
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,550
Why?

220
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,740
Ghal-sur...

221
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,430
Tch!

222
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,870
The barbarian returned to pyr

223
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,890
to claim what he thought his.

224
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,560
The scholar rode to the pantheon,

225
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,060
bloom in hand,

226
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,700
and in the great swamp swallowed me.

227
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,920
You confess your own death,

228
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,000
and yet, you stand before me.

229
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,590
Now I wonder if you are not simply my own madness,

230
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,640
a vision come to torment me.

231
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,850
As the bloom withers, I fade from this place.

232
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,200
Do you not feel warmth?

233
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,170
My story simply is.

234
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,450
To cause you torment is not my intent.

235
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,340
Was I wrong to keep the bloom from them for so long?

236
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:34,230
There is no mercy in the stars, no hope for man.

237
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,390
I cannot say what could have been.

238
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,550
But I can tell you what was.

239
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,640
The story continues.

240
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,350
Will you listen?

241
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,150
While my body lay in the embrace of the swamp,

242
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,860
the sacred bloom traveled with a scholar called ghal-sur,

243
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,270
and my dreams traveled with it.

244
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,070
A lifetime of seasons passed,

245
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,250
until once again, another came,

246
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,890
one bearing secrets.

247
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,540
Go the scholars, you wench!

248
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,170
Give us food!

249
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,130
-Open the gates!    -Protect the books!

250
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,200
Protect the books!

251
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,620
Go! Protect the books!

252
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,340
Charge!

253
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,100
Coins?

254
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,590
Food? Anything?

255
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,170
I've been gone from pyr for many seasons, old man.

256
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,720
What has happened?

257
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,850
Why did the ashur take up arms at their gates?

258
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,060
Dark times have befallen us.

259
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,020
Great mongrel the eunuch king has died

260
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,470
after a very long reign.

261
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,030
He has left no sons.

262
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,570
You'd think someone would have realized

263
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,920
that might be a problem with a eunuch king.

264
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,920
Went off behind the mountains, he did.

265
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,670
Now the city starves.

266
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,750
But you do not answer my question, old man.

267
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,670
Why? Why did the ashur take up arms?

268
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,460
Why do you think?

269
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,760
The scholars care little for our troubles.

270
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,640
The ashur are noble scholars, old man.

271
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,760
No, they have all the secrets of the ages locked in that tower,

272
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,730
yet they share nothing.

273
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,270
What they do not share is surely too vast,

274
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,350
too complex for the uninitiated to comprehend.

275
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,060
Be careful.

276
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,820
I can smell the rotting pages of your books, scholar.

277
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,070
They will do little good when the crows come

278
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,920
and pluck the eyes from your skull.

279
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,410
Doom comes to the pantheon.

280
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,660
Doom comes to pyr!

281
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,790
Doom!

282
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,210
Doom!

283
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,590
Doom!

284
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,010
Grand inquisitor, we do not have the soldiers

285
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,670
to protect the library.

286
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,640
They will rally against us!

287
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,510
Starving people care nothing for the centuries

288
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,570
of stored knowledge we hold here.

289
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,310
-The books will burn!    -Along with the rest of us.

290
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,690
Councilors, please.

291
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,820
We will endure...

292
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,770
Just as we did during the withered spring,

293
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,250
the red tempest, and the night of a thousand suns.

294
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,970
The pantheon is immortal.

295
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,920
And in a season's time,

296
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,920
that horde will have dried up and blown away

297
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,610
like so much dust on a long forgotten Tome.

298
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,100
What if we taught them?

299
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,570
If we opened our gates...

300
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,110
Enough, San-ai!

301
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,730
I'll refer you to the sacred vows

302
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,570
you swore to order.

303
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,770
To gather and protect the knowledge of man.

304
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,270
Our vows call also for mercy!

305
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,920
Our order has no responsibility to the men themselves.

306
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,370
Our gates,

307
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,750
our food stores stay sealed.

308
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,970
Ah!

309
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,960
Especially now that phae-agura

310
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,170
has finally returned

311
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,260
with, I trust,

312
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,770
a bounty of tomes to be indexed,

313
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,250
translated, and archived.

314
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,310
Go forth.

315
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,650
Fulfill your vows.

316
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,270
Argh, phae...

317
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,270
I am doomed to forever wrestle

318
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,170
with these ineffectual cretins.

319
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,460
Now, it has been long since I have left the pantheon.

320
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,470
I would hear of your travels with my own ears.

321
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,420
Tell me...

322
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,130
Did you reach the temples beneath ka-mul?

323
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,050
Yes.

324
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,720
And many of the vaults were flooded,

325
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,970
just as your research showed they would be.

326
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,170
I passed through ruins of unknown design and origin,

327
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,020
a world waiting to be rediscovered.

328
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,560
The sacred texts were hidden deep

329
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,570
within a statue bearing only a single eye.

330
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,070
God of their nameless mound.

331
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,950
Mm, rumors of the statue

332
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,820
being trapped proved false.

333
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,330
Once I was inside, their knowledge came to me

334
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,490
as if with a desire all its own.

335
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,160
I've returned with a great number of them for the library.

336
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,960
I hope you didn't leave the best books

337
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,130
heaped upon that wagon.

338
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,520
Show them to me.

339
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,050
This one in particular caught my eye.

340
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,140
Yes.

341
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
This is truly a wonder.

342
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,560
But what is the script?

343
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,350
I cannot read a page of it.

344
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,220
Ghal-sur?

345
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,770
Inquisitor uruq.

346
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,060
Have you brought me another one?

347
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,040
These have run dry, I'm afraid.

348
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,340
No.

349
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,650
I have come to request knowledge

350
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,670
of our oldest and wisest scholar.

351
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,870
Oldest, wisest...

352
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,010
And most imprisoned!

353
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,020
From the temples beneath ka-mul.

354
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,640
It is not in any script

355
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,570
I have encountered in my studies.

356
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,890
You've spoken for ages

357
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,850
of a key to unlock the true potential

358
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,820
of the flowers you wear around your neck.

359
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,950
Perhaps this is that key.

360
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,450
These are the old names in the old script.

361
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,040
This is indeed the ritual I've so long dreamt of.

362
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,670
I have been chained here,

363
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,630
kept as a pathetic oracle for the ashurban for too long.

364
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,590
This ritual will reveal what these corpses never could.

365
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,870
Release me!

366
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,960
Feigned!

367
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,420
I'll no more release you

368
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,550
than I'll let the council control the library.

369
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,350
Your impulses would overtake you.

370
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,020
Not impulses, uruq.

371
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,370
Studies.

372
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,300
What is the nature of the power you would unleash.

373
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,450
It is unspeakable power.

374
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,010
Whatever you dream, you will have.

375
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,710
I will not free you,

376
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,920
but I have a proposition.

377
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,720
I bring you what you need to perform the ritual,

378
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,430
and you...

379
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,850
Share its power with me.

380
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,530
Share it?

381
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,650
Yes.

382
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,320
Our words shall fill

383
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,110
the living ears of gods long dead.

384
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,050
Pray that they respond.

385
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,970
What must I do?

386
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,390
Take this.

387
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,870
Why?

388
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,770
What is it that you need?

389
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,050
Blood.

390
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,570
I'll need more blood.

391
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,490
But the people starve at our gates.

392
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,120
This is not how it's supposed to be, friend.

393
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,570
Aye, maybe not.

394
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,660
But it is how it is.

395
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,960
If we do nothing, then the pantheon will fall.

396
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,460
Can't you see that?

397
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,930
Be thankful you're in here and not out there.

398
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,390
What does the great text

399
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,720
of og-nesh say about contentment?

400
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,740
"Clear your eyes, and you will see it before you at all times."

401
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,410
This has been a comfort, my friend.

402
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,040
The food's in there!

403
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,130
Take it!

404
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,240
Or we burn it all down.

405
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,210
We're under attack! To arms!

406
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,940
Burn the pantheon!

407
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,570
Throw down your arms and return to your city!

408
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,860
The pantheon's winter reserves could never feed you all.

409
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,110
Perhaps not,

410
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,450
but we will fill our bellies tonight!

411
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,470
Kill the scholars!

412
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,390
The library must be preserved.

413
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,400
Burn the pantheon!

414
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,900
Kill them all! Skin them alive!

415
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,060
The blood you require,

416
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,320
it is flowing.

417
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:50,850
Then let us begin in earnest.

418
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,630
Stop this madness!

419
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,100
There's another way besides

420
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,170
cutting each other down in the streets.

421
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,810
We have books that tell which of the all sorrow's plants

422
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,720
are edible and which are poison.

423
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,890
We can teach you to survive! We can teach you to...

424
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,070
We will teach them nothing.

425
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,360
The wisdom of the library

426
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,370
is for the greatest minds in the world of men.

427
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,740
Inquisitor... what happened?

428
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,240
I am enlightened.

429
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,750
Now I deal with these wretches.

430
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,540
Would they take our vows?

431
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,870
They can't even read the words!

432
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,250
They're animals!

433
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,670
And if they do not flee the pantheon,

434
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,730
they will be slaughtered as animals.

435
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,630
Inquisitor!

436
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,620
Cease your necromancy!

437
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,620
Inquisitor, what have you done?

438
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,960
A traitor to the order of the ashur,

439
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,960
just like the counselors.

440
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,100
I shall shape a new pantheon,

441
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,270
one with no place for those whose resolve is so...

442
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,010
Weak.

443
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,770
Think of all that is gathered here.

444
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:19,710
I shall be oracle to the world.

445
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,490
Beggars, kings, and gods alike

446
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,790
will kneel at the pantheon gate

447
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,140
for merely a sliver of the knowledge I will command.

448
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,270
I will no longer need the books.

449
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,270
I shall drink them in

450
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,430
as I have drunk the life blood from the fallen below us!

451
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,730
You word is the font of knowledge.

452
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,230
The books are more important than any man.

453
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,360
That is our oath. That is our purpose!

454
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,520
I'm making a new oath!

455
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,710
Fealty unto me.

456
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,510
No.

457
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,330
I am phae-agura,

458
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,830
scholar of the library of ashurban,

459
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,540
protector of knowledge,

460
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,250
and I will not let you do this!

461
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,250
I'm afraid there's no room in my new order for heroes.

462
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,890
Oh, make it stop!

463
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,560
Make it stop!

464
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,670
Make it stop!

465
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,030
Oh!

466
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,290
Once freed, ghal-sur destroyed the ashurban pantheon.

467
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,670
The books burned.

468
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,750
The scholars were slaughtered.

469
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,630
Ghal-sur pried secrets from the bloom,

470
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,820
and using them, he amassed great power,

471
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,770
raising an army of disciples.

472
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,430
He had overcome death,

473
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,470
and he had glimpsed into the eye of the un...

474
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:00,100
Ruin and doom!

475
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,570
I had hoped to spare the world the horror of revelation.

476
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,690
The promise of the bloom is meant as a dream, unfulfilled...

477
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,710
In ghal-sur's hands, the bloom is...

478
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,920
I'll hear no more of this!

479
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,950
You would choose ignorance?

480
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:20,250
You who has see the secrets of the stars themselves.

481
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,620
Let me fade.

482
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,210
Let me not hear the pain of the world.

483
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,590
I've served a long, solitary penance already.

484
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,960
I know you have, but you are not the only one

485
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,850
who has faced the void without succumbing to it.

486
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,570
Let me now tell you of moments of great dignity

487
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,490
as the armies of ghal-sur cross the land.

488
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,210
Go now! An army approaches!

489
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,290
A glorious conquest for pyr!

490
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,630
But our triumph tonight...

491
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,510
Will pale when compared

492
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,970
to the immortal grandeur

493
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,470
of our conquest tomorrow.

494
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,940
All hail, ghal-sur!

495
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,430
We shall shatter

496
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,350
all those who oppose us.

497
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:38,320
We shall make them in our image.

498
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,670
Their knowledge is ours.

499
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,610
Look to the horizon.

500
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:48,240
It tells us that there's still a world left to conquer.

501
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,670
Pyr will stretch from the inevitable sea

502
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,220
to the deserts of ui-imir.

503
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,950
We launch.

504
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,350
They're gone.

505
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,450
Everyone's just gone.

506
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,020
Did you find anything for us to eat?

507
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,740
No.

508
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,770
I did find this.

509
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,350
It can at least consecrate our hearth.

510
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,070
The stars!

511
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,870
Like... like sparrows falling

512
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,440
into the lake of ice and diamonds.

513
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,570
They feel so warm to me.

514
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,770
Distant travelers stopped briefly

515
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,170
to huddle around campfires on their journey

516
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,560
across the very spine of night's great body.

517
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,250
And did these travelers lose their homes, too?

518
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,820
Are they as powerless against their nature as we are to ours?

519
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,070
The great dark... It's back is to us.

520
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,370
I don't think it's concerned with such things.

521
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,410
To it, our births and deaths

522
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:08,210
are mere embers drifting free from tiny fires.

523
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,670
It's comforting, in a way.

524
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,170
All that night makes the darkness here

525
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,510
seem so much smaller.

526
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,850
Oh, no.

527
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:28,370
Gull, should we run?

528
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,030
No, there's nowhere to run to.

529
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,920
It's too late.

530
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,070
Our little lives...

531
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,370
So short, so sad.

532
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,750
I'm so grateful that I've gotten to share

533
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,750
so much of mine with you.

534
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,960
Don't be afraid, gull.

535
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,340
Remember all embers fade.

536
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,840
Those flames forever rekindled and extinguished.

537
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,990
I wonder what our fire light looks like to them.

538
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,440
I would have a tale from you, guardian.

539
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,770
The bloom has shown me many things,

540
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,860
but I know nothing of its mother's journey

541
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,570
before opening here on this mountain.

542
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,300
They sang songs of it when I was a boy.

543
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,370
Even now, having seen so much,

544
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,520
I cannot tell where truth gave way to myth.

545
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,430
Beyond light and smoke,

546
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,770
the gods raged in blindness,

547
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,030
their hands without purpose, but to wield tools of war.

548
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,940
The head of one, severed from its body,

549
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,450
spilled blood into the sky,

550
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,420
filling it with both light and dark.

551
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:12,670
The final dream of the dead god...

552
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,550
His sons.

553
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,260
The world was theirs.

554
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,730
Anything they dreamed became manifest.

555
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:27,140
In time, one son dreamt of mankind.

556
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,940
And so came their first breathe.

557
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,970
For ages untold and uncounted,

558
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,790
men and women lived in the shadow of the sons.

559
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,240
To man,

560
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,970
the sons were uncaring gods of their world.

561
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,870
What they learned of it,

562
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,960
they taught themselves...

563
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,760
And they survived.

564
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,720
The sons dreamed of rain...

565
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,150
So floods came.

566
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,820
And mankind learned of loss.

567
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:12,810
Man came to the sun

568
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,690
and begged him to dream her once again.

569
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,610
He learned another lesson that day.

570
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,860
His gods were not merely indifferent...

571
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,530
They were cruel.

572
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,010
He swore revenge.

573
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,070
He promised his followers the world,

574
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,240
and then he showed them how to take it.

575
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,060
The blood, the violence, it bound them to him.

576
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,350
And they named the man seer,

577
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:53,690
the first king of men.

578
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,560
For an age,

579
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:59,320
seer led the hunt for the remaining sons.

580
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,040
He struck again and again.

581
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:16,310
His rage, insatiable.

582
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,720
At last,

583
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,720
asleep in the snowy foothills,

584
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,170
seer found the son who had first dreamed man,

585
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,200
the same son who had refused him.

586
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,320
Knowing his dreams had come to kill him,

587
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,770
the son fled up to the mountain's peak.

588
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,920
As a child, they told me if you listened carefully,

589
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,030
you could still hear the cries of the battle

590
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,220
echoing on the wind.

591
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:09,100
Seer proclaimed his victory to herald a new era of peace.

592
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,890
They say it lasted but a year.

593
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,640
Glory be to seer, the first king,

594
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,950
same as all who have followed him.

595
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,360
One man waited atop the mountain.

596
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,240
Perhaps he felt sorrow

597
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,160
at the death of the world's old masters,

598
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:33,300
perhaps simple curiosity held him there.

599
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,970
What he expected to find, I cannot say.

600
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,670
What he did find...

601
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:46,050
The bloom.

602
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,410
And there, he saw the true dark beyond the light.

603
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,750
The sons of gods were the sons of gods themselves,

604
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:18,830
and they, too, sons of gods,

605
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:20,710
on and on.

606
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:25,950
Every god, a god of death.

607
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,390
In the dark, he saw that man's newfound world

608
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:35,140
was nothing but dust,

609
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,810
and he vowed that he would spare the race of man this truth.

610
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,370
He vowed to keep from them the bloom

611
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,650
and the scope of its revelation.

612
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:47,860
He chose to Grant mankind a gift...

613
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,500
Ignorance.

614
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,770
Eventually, man came.

615
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,070
He knew that they would.

616
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,790
They were desperate for hope.

617
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:04,340
He spared them nothing.

618
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,210
They would not be the last.

619
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,270
And so it went for ages

620
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,250
until...

621
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:15,350
Perhaps the burden had grown too great.

622
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:19,730
Perhaps the Archer was simply too skilled.

623
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,230
No matter the cause, he fell,

624
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,190
and the cycle began anew.

625
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:27,110
Another dread revelation,

626
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:31,460
another guardian to stand watch over the bloom.

627
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,750
I, too, came here seeking hope.

628
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:45,720
Two tyrant kings had been at war since my birth.

629
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,960
Just before the harvest season,

630
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,930
their conflicts came through our fields.

631
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:56,720
Our crops burned. My children starved.

632
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,030
Wounded, raging, I set out.

633
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,650
We fought, and he fell.

634
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:09,370
Many times, I've wished it had gone the other way.

635
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,770
I wanted to know the truth behind the myths of my youth.

636
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,030
I learned it.

637
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,330
I remember now so vividly my first sight of it,

638
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,040
my first breath of it.

639
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,920
It was intoxicating...

640
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,220
All that I'd hoped, more.

641
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,760
I went beyond the stars,

642
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,420
beyond time.

643
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,510
There, I saw the truth.

644
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,670
In the face of the endless light,

645
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,850
everything mankind fights and dies for,

646
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,930
lives and hopes for,

647
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:45,230
it is meaningless,

648
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:47,730
it is all for naught.

649
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,150
And I knew then what every guardian before me had known...

650
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:57,540
That humanity must be protected from that truth.

651
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:02,800
Why not destroy the bloom if it was so powerful?

652
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,510
I ask you...

653
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,210
Who are we to destroy the mysteries of the night.

654
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,930
We merely stand at the threshold

655
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,890
between men and gods.

656
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:22,390
If I had known

657
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,100
what was happening below...

658
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,970
I would have.

659
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,730
The spores of your bloom...

660
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,210
My fault.

661
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,270
I am so tired now.

662
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,170
Daughter of man, let the bloom die.

663
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,830
Leave.

664
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:47,100
Let these words of my failure be my last.

665
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,750
No.

666
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,210
This night is not yet done.

667
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:56,010
Listen, that you might know how I came to find you.

668
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:59,360
And hear the fate of the world.

669
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:28,290
Why do so many fight for ghal-sur?

670
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:31,830
Mighty god king ghal-sur's promise of eternal life

671
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,590
has brought the weak willed to his cause.

672
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,670
We fight to survive.

673
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:40,220
They fight for the chance to escape death.

674
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,140
I am eager to spill their blood.

675
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,470
Don't wish for their deaths, sparrowcrow.

676
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,930
Wish that death might stop.

677
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,270
You wish for peace.

678
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:50,070
I'll wish for revenge.

679
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,100
The walls are holding against the ground troops,

680
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,720
but our scouts to the west

681
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,370
report a new breed of war machine.

682
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,890
How long until they're inside the city walls?

683
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,720
That depends on an array of factors, your grace.

684
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,570
Morale of the troops, supply trains,

685
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,240
-the next batch of grain...    -No more than two sunsets.

686
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:38,370
This is not what your aides have been telling us, general.

687
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,530
Two sunsets.

688
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:43,570
Then our home will burn,

689
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,330
and the world will begin to forget that it ever existed.

690
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:49,450
Tonight is the last night of books of uxon.

691
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,890
Be sure of it.

692
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,430
Jae taught us that king uxon established this order,

693
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,220
that it might always watch over the city,

694
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,140
not that it would idle and wait for its destruction.

695
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,560
We've got to do something.

696
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:18,320
Nothing will end this war, short of an impossibility.

697
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,920
Ghal-sur is immortal. Ghal-sur must die.

698
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,490
Let us fly to his black heart and cut it from its cage.

699
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:30,240
How?! His fortress lies beyond the great swamp.

700
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,120
He is sequestered behind massive iron walls

701
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,830
in a tower made of death itself.

702
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,750
His airships will return to the city walls.

703
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,550
Tomorrow, we board one of those ships

704
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,170
and ride it back to our pyr.

705
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,440
A foolish plan.

706
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,770
Perhaps.

707
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,560
You both believe it can be done?

708
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:55,060
Better to die in glory.

709
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,560
Then tomorrow,

710
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,040
we take back the air.

711
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,370
The flying machine approaches.

712
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,020
Wait till it gets close enough for the catapults to launch.

713
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,730
Argh!

714
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,160
Attack!

715
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,800
Enemy attack!

716
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,470
For uxon.

717
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,410
For jae, we strike.

718
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,600
So much lost.

719
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,270
The elders taught of the great dead swamp

720
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,770
and the fall of the ashur.

721
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,220
But how could they?

722
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,890
How could we have been so blind to this vast, ruin

723
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,820
until it was at our gates?

724
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,920
Look, his black pantheon,

725
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,150
just as jae used to whisper of it.

726
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,920
Is it as you imagined?

727
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,800
It's worse.

728
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,770
God-king, your brave fallen soldiers

729
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,510
have returned from the uxon front.

730
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,020
Will you Grant them your gift

731
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,560
and let them live again beyond the mountains?

732
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,850
We ask not for an answer.

733
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:46,120
Only a sign.

734
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,460
Great god-king ghal-sur,

735
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,460
we humble ourselves before your mercy.

736
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,560
We serve in the hope of your favor.

737
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:21,760
Let the rebirthing process begin.

738
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,560
It is time.

739
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:12,250
If the ship lands, we won't make it over the iron wall.

740
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,240
May we three meet again in this life,

741
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,010
for we know there is no other.

742
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,360
Try to keep us level.

743
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,630
I'm gonna clear the rest of the ship.

744
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:34,640
There's a pest in my forge engine!

745
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,730
Aaah!

746
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,470
Aaah!

747
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,730
Who dares?

748
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:46,370
I do.

749
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,660
Our people have suffered long enough.

750
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,990
Your people are nothing.

751
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:56,070
Your species is meaningless.

752
01:18:56,260 --> 01:19:00,170
I am a god!

753
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,560
Aah!

754
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,020
You failed, little bird.

755
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:27,210
I wonder, do gods also suffer?

756
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,470
The bloom yet lives.

757
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:20,320
Those that have stared into the great dark.

758
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,250
The bloom does not forget who they were.

759
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,330
That's how I knew you were still here, guardian.

760
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,960
For so long, we're shielded the world from that

761
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:34,350
which it could not fathom.

762
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:39,590
Legends and myths were no barrier

763
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:43,140
when the bloom's power was unleashed.

764
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:47,730
Could it ever have been otherwise?

765
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:51,650
It's too late to change what has happened.

766
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:54,970
But not too late to change what will be.

767
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:59,860
Must knowledge only come at a terrible cost?

768
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,860
Rest now.

769
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,770
And I will make the slate clean

770
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:10,250
so that mankind may see the stars with their own eyes.

771
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:21,010
Wait.

772
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:22,470
Wait!

773
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:25,050
Someone approaches.

774
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:34,650
Do not worry. I called him here.

775
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:37,650
You have given me what I need, your sacrifice.

776
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,950
I thank you for it.

777
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:45,170
Know peace at last, guardian.

778
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,250
You have stood your watch until its very end.

779
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:25,920
There must be a million faces I've forgotten

780
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,240
over the centuries.

781
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:32,260
Not yours, swamp witch.

782
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:36,670
Once again, you have the bloom,

783
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:40,460
and once again, I will kill you for it.

784
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:44,220
This is the very last it will grow.

785
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,930
The final breath of the bloom's power upon this world.

786
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:51,670
Your cause is lost.

787
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,810
There are so many secrets still to pry from it.

788
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:59,360
I shall become the truth behind truths.

789
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:02,240
I will be the gates of knowledge,

790
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,370
the very bloom manifest!

791
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,030
Do not mistake ritual for truth.

792
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:11,170
Do not mistake the desire for power

793
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,760
with the desire for knowledge.

794
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,010
Kill her.

795
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,920
Your swamp incantations cannot help you here.

796
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,130
Huh?

797
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,730
Aah!

798
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:26,200
Feel the might of the emperor god!

799
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:52,840
Aah!

800
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:11,340
I am...

801
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,470
You are nothing.

802
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:15,860
Look to the stars, ghal-sur.

803
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,490
Tremble before the immensity of the night!
