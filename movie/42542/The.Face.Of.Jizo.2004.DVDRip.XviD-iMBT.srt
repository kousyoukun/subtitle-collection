<i>Hiroshima - Summer 1948</i>

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:37,026
<i>Tuesday</i>

4
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,407
Daddy, I'm scared. /

5
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:29,344
This way, over here, Mitsue, quick <i>!</i>

6
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:36,161
Get the cushion on your head <i>!</i>
Get in under there.

7
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,894
Daddy, so that's where you've been.

8
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,601
Of course.

9
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,806
You tell me where to go and
that's where I've been.

10
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,334
But...

11
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,175
it's ridiculous, I mean...

12
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,648
preposterous... I... you...

13
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,344
Quit babbling. Get in here.

14
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,717
Daddy. /

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,020
I'm scared <i>!</i>

16
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:16,425
You've got me, the closet and
the cushion for you.

17
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,266
No flashes or booms
are going to hurt you.

18
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:24,604
But, daddy, I'm already 23.

19
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,840
A bit of thunder shouldn't scare me.

20
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,780
It's embarrassing and really gets to me.

21
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,408
Don't blame yourself.

22
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:34,911
I don't know...

23
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,789
You were the tomboy of
the athletics club.

24
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,658
A bit of thunder didn't stop you then.

25
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,129
There were only three of us.

26
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,294
I had to run everything
from the sprint to

27
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:56,966
long distance. Who had time to
worry about thunder?

28
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:02,814
So what happened to turn you
to such a scaredy-cat?

29
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,782
I don't know.

30
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,978
I just am.

31
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,220
Since when?

32
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,759
Since about three years ago.

33
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,294
The A-bomb, eh?

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,459
I guess.

35
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,698
Remember Nobu from the photo shop?

36
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,506
He took a lot of pictures of all of us.

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,010
He was a good photographer.
He took great pictures.

38
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:43,420
Yeah, if you call
those racy pictures great.

39
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,185
Racy?

40
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,586
You used our inn for army officers.

41
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,357
You let out the rooms to them and

42
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,593
got your hands on
a lot of goods that way.

43
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,733
So I did.

44
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,069
We had rice, sake

45
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:09,280
canned salmon, cigarettes,
caramels, everything.

46
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,008
Mom died when you were a little girl.

47
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:20,623
I didn't want you to be starved.
So I tried my best.

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,959
You would lure many women
with cigarettes and rice.

49
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,035
You let Nobu take
those nude photos of them.

50
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,037
He showed them to
those officers. And...

51
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:40,043
Nobu now sells little jellies he gets
from God knows where.

52
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,171
I know.

53
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,809
He wastes his talent,
peddling black-market jellies.

54
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,119
Serves him right <i>!</i>

55
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,986
Just listen to me.

56
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,485
Sorry.

57
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,526
Every time one of his...

58
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,768
magnesium bulbs popped,

59
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,234
he couldn't get the flash of the bomb

60
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,174
out of his head.

61
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,407
That's why he quit taking pictures.

62
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,445
So he says.

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,088
The flashes and the booming remind you
of the bomb, too.

64
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,917
I don't know...

65
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,526
You have to know.

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,863
You got your reason to be scared.

67
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:42,199
Nobody blames an A-bomb
victim for getting

68
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,208
shook up over something that flashes.

69
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:51,042
You got a right to be scared.

70
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,218
Is there a right for being scared?

71
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,049
There should be.

72
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,856
A bomb victim not afraid of
thunder is phoney.

73
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,655
I wouldn't go that far.

74
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,798
Well, maybe... okay.

75
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,120
The sun's come out.

76
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,122
Yeah, the sun <i>!</i>

77
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,694
Thunder seems to have moved on
out to sea.

78
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,457
That's a relief.

79
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:45,460
I've got some barley tea
I made his morning.

80
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,004
Want some?

81
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,838
That's nice.

82
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,740
Can't drink it.

83
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,271
I guess so.

84
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,075
Oh, my... /

85
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,942
What is it?

86
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,385
The sweet bean bun
Mr. Kinoshita gave you.

87
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,787
What if it's been squished?

88
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,052
Oh, no. /

89
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,898
It's still okay.

90
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,640
He got it at a stall.

91
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,443
Buns like this are rare.

92
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:08,783
Mr. Kinoshita says he was
stopped dead in his tracks

93
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:14,190
when he caught sight of the buns.

94
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,787
So he bought one but
then his legs turned to lead.

95
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:24,836
He had to buy another before
he could finally get away.

96
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,172
This is one hell of a bean jam.

97
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:34,803
I was standing by the library
checkout desk. He walks up

98
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,848
and says, "Two are too much
for me, you take one."

99
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,745
Let's eat now.

100
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,025
I can't, you know.

101
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,459
Yeah, I forgot.

102
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,174
Kinoshita gave you the bun.

103
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,304
He teaches at the University
of Science, right?

104
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,916
Yeah, he's attached to
the physics department.

105
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,979
"Attached"?

106
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,454
A kind of teacher.

107
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:26,590
He wears glasses thicker than
two milk bottle bottoms.

108
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,863
He speaks so softly.
He's one hell of an intellectual.

109
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:37,007
He was a Navy Arsenal's
Institute teacher

110
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,670
till the bomb dropped.

111
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,111
He was a lieutenant there.

112
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,521
He's a bit rough for a navy man.

113
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,886
Not all the navy men
are like you think.

114
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,625
He studied again at
Tohoku University

115
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,256
for 2 years after the war ended.

116
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:08,262
He came back here
in early July, this month.

117
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,402
He says that...

118
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:18,807
just after the bomb dropped here
in Hiroshima,

119
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,945
all he did was wander about.

120
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,823
How old is he? 30 maybe?

121
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,184
Twenty-six.

122
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,092
He wrote so on his library card.

123
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,891
And you're 23.
So it's a perfect match.

124
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,838
What're you saying?

125
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,639
He's just a library-goer.

126
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,176
But he gave you the bun.

127
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,910
Ridiculous.
I'm not going on with this.

128
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,688
It's time for supper.

129
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,990
You going to stay?

130
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,321
Up to you.

131
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:09,091
Okay. Give me a hand with
the cleaning up.

132
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,212
Kinoshita gave you the bun
because he liked you.

133
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,687
You ought to get that straight.

134
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,488
You see too much in a little bun.

135
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,558
Even buns can carry a lot of weight.
Remember that.

136
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:48,567
He gave it to me to thank me,
that's all.

137
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,173
More than just thanks in my book.

138
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,304
Oh, daddy. /

139
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,743
Please come here and sit down.

140
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,721
Four days ago,
on Friday last week...

141
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,917
Excuse me.

142
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,223
Objects related to the A-bomb...?

143
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,429
A city hall clerk said to ask here.

144
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:01,679
Even if we gather
information on the bomb,

145
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,375
the occupation forces
forbid going public.

146
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,144
Besides...

147
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:16,960
as an A-bomb victim myself,
I'm trying to forget it.

148
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,897
But...

149
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:25,235
Nothing about what happened
that day in August...

150
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:30,205
will make a story, a picture,
a poem, a novel...

151
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,210
or a subject to be studied.

152
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,822
One instant pulverized
people's whole world.

153
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,755
That's why we don't
collect things on it.

154
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,296
Not only that.
If there were such things,

155
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,265
we'd destroy them for good.

156
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:09,737
I've burnt everything
that'd remind me of my father.

157
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,988
The bun was only to
thank me for that.

158
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,996
You got two checkout desks

159
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,032
at the library, with one girl at each.

160
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,797
That's right,
Miss Takagaki and me. So...?

161
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,575
Since the bomb,
you've not been yourself.

162
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:45,042
You keep everything to
yourself. You smile

163
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,213
only after you come home.

164
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,450
While Miss Takagaki is a cheerful girl.

165
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,489
Yeah, so? What are you getting at?

166
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,929
What makes a fellow like
Kinoshita go for you

167
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,934
instead of someone
more approachable

168
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:09,106
like Miss Takagaki?

169
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,235
It's his privilege.

170
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,108
That's what I'm saying.

171
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,714
Kinoshita has a head on
his shoulders.

172
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:23,049
And you always knew
what was what.

173
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,123
You graduated second in your class.

174
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:32,261
Kinoshita saw the real you
and took notice.

175
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,191
That's what's behind that bun.

176
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,928
That's enough. Stop it.

177
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,697
Your stories have nothing
to do with me.

178
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,536
Another meaning in that bun...

179
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,102
Stop bringing up that bun <i>!</i>

180
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,483
This is crucial for you.
I'm not going to stop it.

181
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:59,647
You come out of the blue and
go on about some stupid bun.

182
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,124
I can't think straight any more.

183
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,829
You fancy Kinoshita, too.

184
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,061
You won't have eyes
for anybody else.

185
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,899
Hard on the outside
but sweet on the inside.

186
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,541
Your heart is like a bun.

187
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,141
Not on your life. /

188
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:27,741
I don't let myself get keen
on anybody and that's that.

189
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:35,492
Then why didn't you push
that bun back in his face?

190
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,555
Absolutely quiet.

191
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,893
That's the main rule at my library.

192
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,092
"Hi <i>!</i> Have a bun."

193
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,395
"No thanks."

194
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,231
"Please. I insist."

195
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,808
"It's against the rules to
accept a bun."

196
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:54,572
Think we can blabber away like
that at the library?

197
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,616
The library staff eavesdrop on
everything that happens.

198
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,245
All I could do was take the bun.

199
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,789
But you'll meet him

200
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,087
during your lunch break tomorrow.

201
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,563
I wanted to say no, but...

202
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,933
But you can't blabber away?

203
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,336
So I just nodded okay.

204
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,301
That means...

205
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:29,380
You watch me tomorrow.
Watch me tell Kinoshita

206
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,383
never to speak to me again.

207
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:40,752
Why do you always
turn everything around?

208
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,029
No harm in fancying him.

209
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,495
You like each other.

210
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,726
Get yourselves together
and live happily.

211
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,998
That's what the bun really means.

212
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,041
I can't be happy.

213
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,612
So just stop talking.

214
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:13,918
I'm head of your fan club.
I won't let you go.

215
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,655
My fan club?

216
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,128
Yep. Think about it.

217
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,694
I started showing up
last Friday, right?

218
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:56,357
That day, your heart
started throbbing

219
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,504
when you caught sight
of Kinoshita.

220
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,207
Isn't that right?

221
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,846
My torso was born of that throbbing.

222
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,454
When he started to approach
the checkout desk,

223
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:21,121
a soft little sigh slipped
from your lips. Right?

224
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,860
My arms and legs
grew out of that sigh.

225
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,932
Then you made a wish
that he would choose

226
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,595
your desk to come up to.

227
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,277
My heart came to
life out of that wish.

228
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,446
Excuse me.

229
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,085
Objects related to the A-bomb...?

230
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,186
A city hall clerk said to ask here.

231
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,027
Is that why you've been

232
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:12,143
hanging around to get me
to fall in love?

233
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,614
Love is out of the question.

234
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,024
Stop pestering me about it.

235
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,823
Stop suppressing your feelings.

236
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,630
Or you'll end up living a dull life.

237
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,705
Keep your nose out of my business.
I'm busy:

238
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:48,279
A supper to make, things
to prepare for tomorrow.

239
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,713
We have a Children's
Summer Storytelling Club where

240
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,412
we tell stories to kids.

241
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:02,126
Every day 30 or 40 kids
get together in a pine forest at Hijiyama.

242
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,263
There's a cool breeze there.

243
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,891
They love our voices

244
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,902
mingled with the sound of the breeze.

245
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:19,936
They look forward to it every day.
I've got to be prepared.

246
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:41,955
<i>Wednesday</i>

247
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,264
"The city of Hiroshima

248
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,231
"has been known as the beautiful city

249
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,735
"on water straddling seven rivers.

250
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:25,637
"These seven rivers flow into one,
the Ohtagawa, in the

251
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,783
"north of the city.

252
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:36,444
"My classmates and
I took great pleasure in

253
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:40,888
"traveling to the villages along
that river where

254
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:46,995
"the people there told us stories
handed down to them.

255
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:53,764
"The truth is, our real reason
was not the stories

256
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:59,400
but the oysters in miso,
the pine mushroom rice,

257
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,843
"the yam jellies in miso

258
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,148
"and treats like that...

259
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:18,157
"That's why we traipsed around there.

260
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,465
"The story you are about to hear is

261
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,401
"one told to us by an old man
at that time.

262
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:32,274
"I remember grilled sweetfish
was served with it.

263
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:41,844
"In the mountains just
a stone's throw from the river... ',

264
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:56,133
There lived an old man and woman.

265
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,896
"The old man was a miser and loafer.

266
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:06,009
"He would rather die than
a decent day's work.

267
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:12,639
"The two were able to get
by thanks to the old woman:

268
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:19,012
"She did everything from
washing clothes to grilling fish.

269
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,218
"One day...

270
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:31,230
the old woman went to catch
some sweetfish. She was thirsty.

271
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,937
"She took a drink from the river.

272
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:39,839
Then all the wrinkles on
her face vanished.

273
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:44,642
"She took another drink and
her back went straight.

274
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,111
"One more drink and

275
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:53,414
"she turned into
a ravishing young beauty.

276
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,462
"She told the old man the news.
He hollered:

277
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,333
"'You're not the only one
to get youth back.

278
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:10,800
"'Just wait and see
the handsome young man I'll turn into.'

279
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,608
"So yelling, he ran out of the house.

280
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:22,417
"And he didn't return though night fell."

281
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,994
Daddy?

282
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,762
Will this heat never let up <i>!</i>

283
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,467
So you're here?

284
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,129
I sure am. Haven't seen you
for a whole day.

285
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,740
Can you stop that rumbling?

286
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:50,746
I can't rehearse my story <i>!</i>
What are you doing?

287
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,544
I got some small fry.

288
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:56,882
And I'm adding miso.
I've ground it up good.

289
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,755
How did you guess what
I was planning to make?

290
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,693
You had the small fry
and the miso here.

291
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:11,400
Now, in goes the miso
just like this...

292
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:27,216
And now we mix in
the finely chopped chillies.

293
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:43,193
And you have it, small fry
in miso, our speciality.

294
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,468
Not bad at all.

295
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,575
I'm still a good cook, eh?

296
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,676
What happens next
in that story of yours?

297
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,309
What becomes of the old man?

298
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,986
Even though night fell,
he didn't return home.

299
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:08,184
The old woman goes out looking
for him with a lantern.

300
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,397
She gets to the bank of the river.

301
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,295
She sees a little baby bawling.

302
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,239
Kids these days won't like it.

303
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,571
I'm not forcing them to.

304
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,181
You must put a bit more spice into it.

305
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,406
Make it like this:

306
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,951
The old geezer doesn't come back.

307
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,716
The old woman goes out to find him.

308
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,489
All she finds is a pair of dentures.

309
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,359
The old geezer drank too much water.

310
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,030
He got himself unborn.

311
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,531
I get that point.

312
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,571
It's a lot funnier, eh?

313
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,874
Don't touch a story.

314
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:09,885
You must relate the older
generations' stories as they are.

315
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:16,055
That's the philosophy of
the Folktale Research Club.

316
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:21,528
Remember what the inspector said
six years ago?

317
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,625
"Forget folktales and
work at the factory.

318
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,035
"We got a war on.
This is an emergency."

319
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,371
Your club broke up in 1942,
if I recall.

320
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:38,974
But the spirit of that club
is still live inside me.

321
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:46,618
That's what you and
Kinoshita had an argument about, eh?

322
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:52,361
It wasn't an argument.
It was a debate.

323
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,008
Out of the question. /

324
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:25,387
You answered so sharply that
Kinoshita was jolted.

325
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:33,094
Kinoshita first got interested
in the bomb when

326
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,636
he found a burnt roof title.

327
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,773
Yeah, he told me.

328
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,342
That year,

329
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:47,577
he came here to Hiroshima to catch
a train home to Iwate.

330
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,553
He roamed around the burnt-out city.

331
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:59,086
He sat himself down where
there'd been a temple.

332
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,064
He opened his lunch box. Then...

333
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:08,503
he felt something like needles
under his buttocks.

334
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:13,569
He sat on a roof tile
thrown there by the bomb.

335
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,107
The tile is covered in thorns,

336
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:22,185
all sticking out in the same direction.

337
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:27,383
The tile's surface had melted to form it

338
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,722
in that instant of heat.

339
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,794
He thought he had to know
more about the bomb:

340
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:41,429
What happened in that intense heat.

341
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,769
He picked up all the tiles
he could find,

342
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,208
on his way back to the station.

343
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,572
He told me that too.

344
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,312
You took one of the tiles
for safe keeping.

345
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,784
I didn't take it.

346
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:04,852
He forced it on me and left.

347
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:55,670
The sliver of glass from
the bomb victims.

348
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,310
It's inhuman.

349
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,321
The roof tile.

350
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,692
It's so sharp.

351
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,011
A twisted medicine bottle.

352
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,507
Awful.

353
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:44,986
Kinoshita says he's got beer bottles
twisted like this.

354
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:51,065
And big sake bottles warped into
the shape of a horn.

355
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:57,066
A standing stone lantern whose
surface is foamy bubbles.

356
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,735
And a burnt grandfather clock.

357
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,013
The landlady of his
boarding house is trying

358
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,675
to kick him out.

359
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,612
Really?

360
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,120
Every time he comes back
with more objects,

361
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,761
she complains,
"They give me the creeps.

362
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,089
"They'd go through the floor.

363
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:27,535
"I'll have to up your rent."
She's on his back all the time.

364
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:34,044
She really gave it to him when
he came back with more tiles.

365
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:39,314
She cut the amount of
food for his supper.

366
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,248
What a landlady <i>!</i>

367
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:53,594
Kinoshita came to me today and said:

368
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,097
I know I'm asking a lot.

369
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:04,069
But could you keep my stuff
in the library?

370
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,347
It's impossible, eh?

371
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,853
One word from MacArthur
and we could.

372
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:25,025
I felt sorry for him and asked
if I could sleep on it.

373
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,691
So I must see him again tomorrow.

374
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,496
He's a real pain.

375
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,594
Your handkerchief...

376
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,967
Handkerchief.

377
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:50,316
Small fry in miso for Kinoshita.
Give it to him tomorrow.

378
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,355
Daddy. /

379
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,288
Men like girls' handkerchieves.

380
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:00,557
Stop imagining things and
reading everything into them.

381
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,199
Then give it to your boss.

382
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:08,135
My boss's wife is a jealous woman.

383
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,933
It might cause trouble.

384
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,599
Then give it to Kinoshita.

385
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,279
Don't do anything like this again.

386
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,481
Now, what were you arguing

387
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,585
about with Kinoshita?

388
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,718
Before we parted, he asked:

389
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,668
Isn't it a good idea to use my objects

390
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,396
in trying to tell the children

391
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,039
about what happened?

392
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:54,642
He sure has a head on his shoulders.

393
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,287
I told him it was impossible,

394
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,925
we couldn't touch the original stories.

395
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,759
There you go again. /

396
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:09,426
It's one thing to stick to
the original stories, but...

397
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:15,165
He kept on pushing the stuff
he collected on me.

398
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,705
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

399
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,704
Out of the question. /

400
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,848
Then I started shouting, I guess.

401
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,055
That's about it.

402
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,653
I just had a brilliant idea.

403
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,855
Your big ideas for things
can't be counted on.

404
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:47,163
You often started up some
new business and failed.

405
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:52,299
You lost everything but
the little inn granddad left.

406
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,770
Anyway...

407
00:36:55,179 --> 00:37:00,276
everything left to me would
have gone with the bomb.

408
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,778
I saw past things.

409
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,253
That insults all people who
work their guts out.

410
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,983
Okay.

411
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:14,758
You'll end up arguing
if you just repeat those stories.

412
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,268
Why not slip
Kinoshita's material in them?

413
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,871
He'll be tickled then.

414
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:26,209
The storytelling is for children.

415
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,938
Sure it is. Look...

416
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,140
Just take a fairytale.
Any one you like.

417
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,913
And work the atom bomb into it.

418
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,351
How?

419
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,089
You figure it out.

420
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:46,926
The occupation forces keep
an eye on everything.

421
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:52,058
You just don't know how powerful
the occupation army is.

422
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,098
Got it <i>!</i>

423
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,236
I have to memorize my stories.

424
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,939
You can leave any time.
Do visit again.

425
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:08,844
You'll be telling your stories
to the kids.

426
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:14,324
The wind will carry
your words everywhere.

427
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,460
They'll enter the kids' hearts.

428
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,723
They'll turn into little rainbows.

429
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,332
There'll be no proof.

430
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:27,298
The Hiroshima wind is
fighting for you.

431
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:33,109
May not do you any good,
but listen to me.

432
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,578
Everyone knows...

433
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:44,586
the story of the Little Inch-High
Warrior in Kyoto.

434
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:50,691
He hops into the red ogre's mouth
to save a princess.

435
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,093
He sticks a sewing needle to
the ogre's tummy.

436
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,565
The ogre surrenders at last.

437
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,034
The Warrior's powerful.

438
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:06,440
But the Little Inch-High Warrior
of Hiroshima is even more powerful.

439
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,408
Of Hiroshima?

440
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,345
Come to Mitsue's Apron Theater <i>!</i>

441
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,590
Apron Theater?

442
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,228
Apron pockets can help
dramatize a story.

443
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:36,565
He does hop into the ogre's tummy.
But after that...

444
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,698
the story goes differently.

445
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,214
Having found himself inside
the ogre's belly,

446
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,280
he pushes the tile to it.

447
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,547
"Hey, ogre. /

448
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,883

The red ogre's writhes in pain.

470
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:45,235
His red face just gets paler and paler.

471
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:51,269
The Warrior of Hiroshima took
a twisted medicine bottle.

472

"Hey, ogre <i>!</i> I'm going to

00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,117
"your guts and appendix <i>!</i>"

483
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,594
I said stop it <i>!</i>

484
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:53,268
It was so inhuman:

485
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,500
What people did to...

486
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,938
people was to line up...

487
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:10,177
two suns in the sky.

488
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:24,125
It might be too much for
the people of Hiroshima...

489
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,330
to take slipping things
from the bomb...

490
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,641
into a story...

491
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,868
any story.

492
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:42,146
Keep that in mind.

493
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:50,694
I wanted Kinoshita to be keen on you.
But I was wrong.

494
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:02,204
Just another of my big ideas.

495
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:11,044
Be content with the small fry in miso.

496
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,844
Give it to him tomorrow.

497
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,595
Thank you, daddy, for everything...

498
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,005
you've done for me.

499
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,412
Daddy?

500
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:20,080
<i>Thursday</i>

501
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:33,223
<i>Yesterday's rain was clever.</i>

502
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:39,861
<i>It came down at night and</i>
<i>stopped in the morning</i>.

503
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:47,804
<i>This rain doesn't have the brains</i>
<i>it was born with.</i>

504
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,813
<i>It started in the morning</i>.

505
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,746
<i>It hasn't stopped yet</i>.

506
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:59,147
<i>Rain, rain, go away!</i>

507
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:07,129
<i>Your old man's a brute</i>.

508
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,368
<i>Your old mum's a floozy.</i>

509
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:24,915
"Mr. Tadashi Kinoshita...

510
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:29,945
"care of Mrs. Takizawa.

00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,112
"Dear Mr. Kinoshita..."

00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:35,389
"Dear Mr. Kinoshita"?

513
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:54,141
"Thank you for visiting the library...

00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:06,187

"...take good care of yourself...

522
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:56,406
Home already?

523
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:57,902
Daddy?

524
00:47:58,143 --> 00:47:59,667
I'm here all right.

525
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,876
What're you doing here?

526
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:06,915
The rain spoiled our storytelling.

527
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,417
It should've rained at night.

528
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:15,788
Poor kids. / Come back
to get something?

529
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,521
I left work early.

530
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,963
Feeling sick?

531
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,593
You aren't nauseous, are you?

532
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:29,400
Is it the dizziness,
the ringing in your ears?

533
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:32,339
Is it the radiation sickness?

534
00:48:32,544 --> 00:48:34,341
Not recently.

535
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:37,445
That's a relief.

536
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:42,185
The only place it aches is here.

537
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,485
Is that all?

538
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:51,254
Maybe that monster of
an illness has finally gone away.

539
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:57,226
When you believe he's gone,
he catches you by surprise.

540
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:59,598
You can't relax so easily.

541
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:05,138
It's really awful, eh?

542
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:10,672
Look <i>!</i>

543
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:15,043
We did it <i>!</i>

544
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:18,679
It's finally stopped raining.

545
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:23,452
I was all but out of things
to catch it in.

546
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:31,696
So everything work out?

547
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,470
Meaning...?

548
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,535
The small fry in miso.

549
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,105
Was Kinoshita happy?

550
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,806
Oh, that.

551
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:46,977
Didn't he say,
"Oh, this is my favorite food"?

552
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,886
I still have it.

553
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:53,986
Here it is.

554
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,054
Why is it here?

555
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:00,322
I didn't go to see him.

556
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,228
Why not?

557
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:07,937
It was raining for one thing...

558
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,537
You got an umbrella.

559
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:15,410
I could slip on the paths.

560
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,776
You have good clogs.

561
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:21,816
Besides...

562
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,456
What?

563
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:31,027
It's best not to see him again.

564
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:40,130
Stop saying that or you'll
become a laughingstock.

565
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,403
I stayed at the library instead of going.

566
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,071
You still have time.

567
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:54,951
Then I saw Kinoshita walking
toward the library.

568
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:59,156
I left so as not to meet him.

569
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:06,320
What a girl. /
I'd smack some sense into you <i>!</i>

570
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,062
Daddy...

571
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:10,798
It's best this way.

572
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:14,696
I mustn't fall in love with anyone.

573
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,209
Mind you don't lose all heart.

574
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,340
I'll be fine <i>!</i>

575
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,838
Let me be, okay?

576
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,165
You can't fool me.

577
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,865
What's up?

578
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:45,834
I know you're lying.

579
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,568
Don't pretend you don't fancy him.

580
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,231
Look, all I said was...

581
00:51:51,376 --> 00:51:53,071
It's obvious.

582
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:00,575
"Yours truly." It's all here, right?

583
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,380
All women write that.

584
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:08,185
"As I live by myself..."
Do all women write that?

585
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:11,454
It's a joke.
I planned to throw it away.

586
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:14,897
I'll keep it.

587
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,227
Daddy...

588
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,825
Why insist you can't fall in love?

589
00:52:20,772 --> 00:52:25,072
You may not be a ravishing beauty.

590
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:29,578
But you've got respectable-enough
features.

591
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:31,409
Ridiculous.

592
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:37,249
It's a good enough face for Kinoshita.
Why worry?

593
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:39,913
That's not the point.

594
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,195
The radiation sickness?

595
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:52,025
You can't fall in love,
because it may hit you again?

596
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,702
But he said

597
00:52:55,373 --> 00:53:00,572
he'd take best care of me
if it came to that.

598
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:05,513
You two seem to have it all sewn up.

599
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:11,320
Are you worried about your future kids?

600
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:16,722
Radiation sickness does
get passed down to babies.

601
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:22,231
If that's our fate, we'll
bring them up best as we can.

602
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,234
Did he say that?

603
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:29,772
More or less. Not so straight, though.

604
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:36,309
Whether it's more or less,
you've gone that far.

605
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,108
You don't need me.

606
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:43,814
And it's all the more reason
I can't go on seeing him.

607
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:54,862
You're close to him now
but you don't want to be?

608
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,466
More or less.

609
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:01,563
Stop this nonsense or I'll get mad.

610
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,868
You change your stories so often.

611
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:10,003
What you say is topsy-turvy.
I can't tell which end is up.

612
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:14,707
Kindly be seated, father.

613
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:18,053
I will.

614
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:30,194
There are many other people who
should have been able

615
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,063
to lead a happy life.

616
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:35,795
Who am I to elbow
my way past them and

617
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,534
make a claim on happiness?

618
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:43,945
If I did, I'd never be able to
look them in the face.

619
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,975
Who are you talking about?

620
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,286
People like Akiko Fukumura,
for instance.

621
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,185
Akiko Fukumura? Her?

622
00:54:58,229 --> 00:55:01,562
We went through schools together.

623
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:05,829
We always sat next to each other.

624
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:08,669
Because of family names:

625
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:13,470
They both started with
the character for "Lucky."

626
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:20,384
So everyone called us Lucky One
and Lucky Two.

627
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:26,187
When you were both absent,
the teacher called it "unlucky."

628
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:32,627
We started up the
Folktale Research Club at college.

629
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:37,497
With Akiko as president and
me as vice president.

630
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:41,499
We made the strict policy:

631
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,005
Original stories are not to be touched.

632
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,934
And you stuck to it?

633
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:48,876
That's right.

634
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:53,545
You two competed on grades, too.

635
00:55:54,986 --> 00:56:00,549
I could outrun her, but
I never outdid her on grades.

636
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,386
I always came in second.

637
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,029
It's your fault.

638
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,195
Don't blame me.

639
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:13,728
Besides that, she was really pretty.

640
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:18,738
Everybody called her
the prettiest around.

641
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,169
Because her mother
was a goodlooker.

642
00:56:24,315 --> 00:56:27,716
And she was a widow to boot.

643
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:32,413
One look at her and I got so thrilled.

644
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,521
So you wrote her a letter.

645
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,457
You sent it with some food.

646
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:46,160
"Miss Fukumura, may I accompany you
to view cherry blossoms?

647
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:50,665
"Very kindly yours.
Takezo Fukuyoshi."

648
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,602
How did you find it out?

649
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,208
Akiko showed it to me.

650
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:03,815
She said, "'Very kindly yours' is weird."

651
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:06,414
How so?

652
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:11,956
It's the sort of thing women write.

653
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,363
She showed it to her daughter?

654
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,861
What a nasty widow <i>!</i>

655
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:24,037
She treated me like a
real mother very tenderly.

656
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:29,206
And she should've been your mother.

657
00:57:29,347 --> 00:57:32,145
She should've married me.

658
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:36,777
Akiko should have had
a chance at happiness.

659
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:39,454
Why's that, then?

660
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:45,886
She was prettier than me,
more clever and more popular.

661
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:50,595
And she saved me from the A-bomb.

662
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:52,862
Saved you from the bomb?

663
00:57:53,371 --> 00:57:58,308
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be alive today.

664
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:04,275
Absurd <i>!</i> You and I were
the only people in our garden then.

665
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,474
What are you talking about?

666
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,313
She saved me with a letter.

667
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,980
A letter?

668
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:15,685
Akiko was teaching at a girls' school.

669
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:22,260
She had gone to an airplane factory
with her pupils.

670
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:27,935
I had received a letter from
her the day before.

671
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,569
I soon wrote a reply.

672
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:49,856
Be careful <i>!</i>

673
00:59:13,184 --> 00:59:14,549
Daddy.

674
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,710
They're dropping something.

675
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:24,786
Funny, there's been no air raid warning.

676
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,125
Wonder what they're dropping.

677
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,334
Propaganda flyers again?

678
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:35,499
Oh, no. /

679
00:59:51,522 --> 00:59:56,960
Everything under the sun
turned pale white.

680
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:04,899
I saw it full on, a huge fireball
as bright as two suns.

681
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:08,436
Blindingly white at the center

682
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:14,144
with a weird kind of yellow
and red outline.

683
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:19,243
I was shielded from the heat

684
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:22,481
by the stone lantern.

685
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,817
That big stone lantern?
It was worth its cost.

686
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,995
Because I got a letter from Akiko,

687
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,961
I was kneeling down by the lantern.

688
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:43,129
That's why I said she saved my life.

689
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:55,410
What is it?

690
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,247
Akiko had taken

691
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:05,661
the first train
from Mizushima to Hiroshima.

692
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:14,597
She was on her way to
the school to fetch things for

693
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,903
her evening tutorial:

694
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,069
Mimeograph things and stuff.

695
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:24,141
What did she do then?

696
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:28,174
She stopped off at her mother's,

697
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,349
then set out for school at 8.

698
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:39,821
She was hit by the bomb
near a Red Cross office.

699
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:48,527
Akiko's mother didn't find her till
a whole day after.

700
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:51,707
She had been...

701
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:57,680
laid out on the office's dirty floor.

702
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:03,015
Oh, my God... the poor little girl.

703
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:09,582
Her buttocks were completely exposed:

704
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:15,829
The back of her pants burnt off.

705
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:24,465
And there was a little patch
of dried stool...

706
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:31,075
I've heard enough.

707
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:37,544
Now I think I know why you feel

708
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:40,657
you can't seek out happiness.

709
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:47,125
But, why not live out
Akiko's happiness for her?

710
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,822
I can't do that. /

711
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,456
Why not?

712
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:55,033
Because I promised her mother.

713
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:56,434
Her mother?

714
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,208
Something...

715
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,869
akin to a promise.

716
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:05,277
What promise?

717
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:12,020
I met her mother three days
after the blast.

718
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:17,153
In the early evening of August 9.

719
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:22,889
I had run off to
Mrs. Horiuchi's house.

720
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:28,429
I stayed there till
the morning of the 9th.

721
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:32,201
Mrs. Horiuchi?
The name rings a bell.

722
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:37,504
My flower arranging teacher
from school.

723
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:41,448
Oh, that old Mrs. Horiuchi?

724
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:47,422
Lucky for you to have
such a nice teacher.

725
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,169
I left that morning and
got home around noon.

726
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:07,266
The whole city smelt like
grilled fish then.

727
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:10,770
Yeah, grilled into oblivion.

728
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:15,510
I cried picking up your bones.

729
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:18,653
I know.

730
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:23,084
Thank you.

731
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:38,272
Then I went to Akiko's.
But I found...

732
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:44,609
everything was burnt to the ground.
I saw her mother.

733
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:49,652
She was lying in a tunnel dug
into the garden.

734
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:57,026
She was on her stomach
because her back was

735
01:04:57,461 --> 01:05:00,328
covered in enormous blisters.

736
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,395
Oh, the poor woman.

737
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:08,738
She looked...

738
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:14,810
really happy to see me.

739
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:20,710
She got to her feet and
hugged me really tight.

740
01:05:21,819 --> 01:05:24,788
She thanked me for coming.

741
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:34,197
But when she started
telling me about Akiko...

742
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,463
she turned white as a ghost.

743
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:42,167
She glared at me and said...

744
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,845
Go on.

745
01:05:57,654 --> 01:05:59,849
"What are you doing alive?"

746
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:12,095
"Why are you alive when
my daughter isn't?"

747
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:37,854
She was dead...

748
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:42,460
by the end of the month, too.

749
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,998
This may not help but...

750
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:54,274
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

751
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:59,314
No, it was unnatural for
me to have survived. /

752
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:03,410
I don't deserve to live.

753
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:06,352
Don't say a thing like that. /

754
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,889
Listen to me <i>!</i>

755
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:09,356
No, I won't <i>!</i>

756
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:20,966
Almost all of my friends are gone.

757
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:29,170
Etsuko died while standing
in a fire-prevention reservoir.

758
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:33,940
Kaori just walked along.

759
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:40,415
Her tongue swollen out of her mouth,
like a huge eggplant.

760
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:46,094
Fumiko'd gotten married
just after graduation.

761
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:51,558
She died with her baby
at her breast.

762
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:57,505
The baby, too, went to
the other world,

763
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:05,572
without even an inkling of
what this world is like.

764
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,582
Machiko at the telephone exchange...

765
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:14,480
Two of her coworkers

766
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:20,095
were too scared to move.
She put her arms around them.

767
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:26,934
She told them to be brave.

768
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:30,563
But they all died there, too.

769
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:38,146
It's been three years since.

770
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:41,912
But some are still missing.

771
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,716
And there's you, too, daddy...

772
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:54,758
You and I have our old agreement.

773
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:56,259
Remember that.

774
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,033
That's wrong.

775
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:03,235
To die in Hiroshima was
the natural thing.

776
01:09:03,674 --> 01:09:06,609
To survive here is unnatural.

777
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:11,044
That's why my being
alive now is wrong.

778
01:09:11,882 --> 01:09:14,248
Dead people don't think so.

779
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,713
I'm perfectly at peace with
what happened to me.

780
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:22,051
Listen.

781
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:28,798
I don't deserve to be alive.

782
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,760
But...

783
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,774
I have to live like this.

784
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:56,957
I'm just going to live a quiet life.

785
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,159
I'll leave life...

786
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:08,669
quietly when I get the chance to do so.

787
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,014
Daddy...

788
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:28,748
It's been three very hard years for me.

789
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:39,034
Please at least give me credit
for managing to stay alive.

790
01:10:48,879 --> 01:10:50,039
Going out?

791
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:59,850
Back to the library.
I have some books to repair there.

792
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,454
Maybe Kinoshita...

793
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:05,754
Hold on a minute.

794
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:19,035
Take this to the post office
on your way.

795
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:27,279
Special delivery <i>!</i>

796
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:30,516
Ridiculous...

797
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:32,850
That's an order. /

798
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:20,502
<i>Friday</i>

799
01:13:58,635 --> 01:13:59,897
Daddy...

800
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:05,668
Did you call me?

801
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,769
You've been here?

802
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,007
Yeah, more or less.

803
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:18,317
Will Kinoshita bring more things?

804
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:21,218
This is a half of what he's got.

805
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:24,823
Quite a collection, eh?

806
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:28,020
You can't blame his landlady.

807
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:39,735
How far did the driver say...

808
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:43,437
his boarding house was from here?

809
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,740
5 kilometers one way.

810
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:50,182
With six traffic signals and
one railway crossing.

811
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,111
Then I'd estimate that

812
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:56,589
he'd be back in 30 or 40 minutes.

813
01:14:56,726 --> 01:15:01,390
Thank him for everything and
offer him a bath.

814
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:02,691
A bath?

815
01:15:03,033 --> 01:15:05,866
It's the best treat on a hot day.

816
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,902
Preparing for it?

817
01:15:08,038 --> 01:15:09,198
You bet.

818
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:11,471
You're thoughtful.

819
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:15,401
I'm used to things of this sort.

820
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:19,948
How does he like it?
Boiling hot or tepid?

821
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,449
How should I know?

822
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:25,418
I'll aim for something in between.

823
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:30,185
You'll have to give him
something cold too.

824
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,317
I've bought beer.

825
01:15:32,462 --> 01:15:34,259
Good going.

826
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:38,766
The driver'll have to content himself
with cold water.

827
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:41,200
I've bought ice too.

828
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:46,570
And you'll have to ask the driver
to leave early.

829
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,301
He will. He's busy.

830
01:15:48,445 --> 01:15:49,969
That's good.

831
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:53,840
Have you got new towels ready?

832
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,108
I've bought them.

833
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:55,910
Soap?

834
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:56,882
Bought.

835
01:15:58,421 --> 01:15:59,080
A sponge?

836
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,481
Bought one.

837
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,113
A man's bathrobe?

838
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:03,350
Bought...

839
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:07,028
No, why should I?

840
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:11,691
It'd be scandalous to
buy a man's bathrobe.

841
01:16:11,835 --> 01:16:17,034
And it's premature for
you to wash him up in the bath.

842
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:19,403
That'd be scandalous, too.

843
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,407
Put more firewood...

844
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:25,139
I know.
What'll you serve him for dinner?

845
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:26,942
Beer and small fry.

846
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:28,840
Sardines.

847
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:30,911
And rice.

848
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:33,249
Anything to go with rice?

849
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:37,985
Chopped carrots and
then deep fried Tofu.

850
01:16:38,128 --> 01:16:39,595
Sounds delicious.

851
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:42,095
Topped off with a slice of melon.

852
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:43,665
Can I eat them, too?

853
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:51,440
Nothing'd make me happier than
to see you eat.

854
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:54,606
Summer vacation...?

855
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:57,207
Vacation?

856
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:02,008
Kinoshita said it'd be nice

857
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:05,446
if you could go with
him up to Iwate

858
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:08,886
during his summer vacation.

859
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:12,756
Said his folks'd be happy to see you.

860
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:18,160
I guess I'd get time off if I wanted.

861
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:21,533
Then go with him.

862
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:27,106
I've always wanted to go to Iwate:

863
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,878
Kenji Miyazawa came from there.

864
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,714
Who's he?

865
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:37,210
A poet and children's story writer.

866
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:41,255
His books are popular in our library.

867
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,791
I like his poems, too.

868
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:45,858
What poems?

869
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:51,228
"The Morning of Last Farewell" and...

870
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,130
"Once Around the Stars."

871
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:56,601
"Once Around the Stars"?

872
01:17:57,941 --> 01:18:02,571
<i>The Scorpion with red,</i>
<i>burning eyes.</i>

873
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:09,084
<i>The Eagle with wings</i>
<i>so gracefully unfurled</i>.

874
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:14,987
<i>Little Dog his eyes</i>
<i>so blue and bright</i>.

875
01:18:16,326 --> 01:18:21,958
<i>The long Snake of light shines</i>
<i>in iits own world</i>.

876
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,802
The poem has lots of
constellation names in it.

877
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:33,774
I too wrote a poem about
the stars as a kid.

878
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,104
You did?

879
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:40,875
<i>The night has come again tonight</i>.

880
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:45,851
<i>Three, four</i>... <i>seven stars</i>.

881
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:56,021
<i>And dozing off I count the stars.</i>...

882
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:58,898
I'll go check on the fire.

883
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:03,802
The teacher gave me a B
for it and pinned it on the wall.

884
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:15,951
Kinoshita's asking you to go
with him was a proposal.

885
01:19:16,286 --> 01:19:17,776
You got that?

886
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:25,650
<i>In the heavens the stars twinkle.</i>

887
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:30,655
<i>On the ground the burglars burgle</i>
<i>in the forest.</i>

888
01:19:31,034 --> 01:19:36,631
<i>Through the trees</i>
<i>the ragged owl bumps</i>.

889
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:41,608
<i>While the temple raccoon pounds</i>
<i>his belly like drums.</i>...

890
01:19:53,222 --> 01:19:54,712
Daddy...

891
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:10,336
He has a little beard.
You'll have to get a razor.

892
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:13,566
I don't keep razors in the house.

893
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:18,575
Too many bomb victims
killed themselves with them.

894
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:25,478
Some cut their left wrist and
stuck their arm in the bath.

895
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:29,986
Are you packing or something?

896
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:34,994
Doesn't look like you'll take
a summer holiday.

897
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:40,065
I'll help Mrs. Horiuchi with
her flower arranging.

898
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:45,766
If I leave now, I'll be able to
catch the 7:05 train.

899
01:20:55,118 --> 01:20:59,646
Give it another thought.
Kinoshita'll be back.

900
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:03,086
You invite him and kick him out?

901
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:04,793
How rude <i>!</i>

902
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:11,196
I'll leave him a note at
the front door. Don't worry.

903
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:15,695
What about the dinner
you cooked up for him?

904
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:19,774
He can have it all to himself.
I'll write so.

905
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:24,539
But the bath <i>!</i>
Is he to take it by himself?

906
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,580
After that...

907
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:33,152
"Close the shutters when you leave.
Lock the door.

908
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:36,281
"Leave the key with
the next door neighbor."

909
01:21:36,526 --> 01:21:39,689
And the last line is...

910
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:44,299
I'll keep your invaluable
objects for you.

911
01:21:44,801 --> 01:21:50,296
"But please forget about me.
Sincerely yours..."

912
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:52,971
The library...?

913
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:54,167
I won't go.

914
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,539
The old sickness again?

915
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,408
No <i>!</i>

916
01:21:58,548 --> 01:22:00,072
Yes <i>!</i> The sickness <i>!</i>

917
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:07,589
I came out of the throbbing
of your heart,

918
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:12,592
from the heat of your sighs
and your faint wishes.

919
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:16,095
I won't allow you to write this. /

920
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,326
Give me back the pencil <i>!</i>

921
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,335
It was Akiko's.

922
01:22:22,472 --> 01:22:26,533
She gave it to me before
the bomb dropped.

923
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:30,869
You're sick.
There's a name for what you have.

924
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,805
The symptoms appear in people

925
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,942
who have survived their friends.

926
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:41,045
It's called "Guilt-ridden Survivoritis."

927
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:43,820
I know how you feel.

928
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:48,958
But you're alive and
you must go on living.

929
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:52,727
Get over this sickness right away.

930
01:22:54,670 --> 01:23:00,302
The person I feel so awful
and guilty about is...

931
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:05,376
You, daddy.

932
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:10,779
What?

933
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:21,123
Of course I feel really guilty about
Akiko and others too.

934
01:23:21,631 --> 01:23:27,592
But I was just trying to
cover up and deny...

935
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:33,065
what I did with the sense of guilt.

936
01:23:33,576 --> 01:23:39,378
I left you where you were
and ran away. That's fact.

937
01:23:48,925 --> 01:23:54,261
Your face was so badly burnt then.

938
01:23:55,464 --> 01:24:00,663
It was melted away like
the face of this Jizo.

939
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:07,468
And I did nothing.
I left you and ran away.

940
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,681
We've been over that.
It's settled.

941
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:17,076
I thought so, too.

942
01:24:17,954 --> 01:24:23,517
That's why I didn't remember
what happened until now.

943
01:24:24,327 --> 01:24:28,195
But seeing this face

944
01:24:29,165 --> 01:24:33,932
brought it all back to me so clearly.

945
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:40,169
I'm the daughter whose father fell into
a sea of flames.

946
01:24:40,343 --> 01:24:43,073
And I ran away from it.

947
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:48,612
A human being like that
has no right to be happy.

948
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:54,448
That's totally absurd.

949
01:24:57,994 --> 01:25:00,656
Remember, daddy?

950
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:07,962
I came to and the house was
collapsed on top of us.

951
01:25:09,171 --> 01:25:14,768
I knew something terrible'd happened.
I didn't know what.

952
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:20,180
I just knew I had to get out
from under there.

953
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:24,052
I managed to wriggle my way out.

954
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:27,948
But you couldn't budge.

955
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:31,492
You just lay there

956
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:38,256
on your back with pillars, beams,

957
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:42,002
and all these pieces of wood

958
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:46,772
everywhere on top of you.

959
01:25:49,045 --> 01:25:52,139
"Somebody, come and
save my daddy. /"

960
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:57,148
So I screamed.

961
01:25:58,788 --> 01:26:01,086
But nobody came.

962
01:26:10,066 --> 01:26:15,527
The same sort of thing was happening
all over Hiroshima.

963
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:26,133
I had no saw or ax, not even a mallet.

964
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:30,509
I tried to lift up a big pillar.

965
01:27:31,347 --> 01:27:34,942
I tried everything but it didn't work.

966
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,988
You did all you could have.

967
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:46,920
Then I smelled this acrid smoky smell.

968
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:53,392
I saw our hair and eyebrows were...

969
01:27:53,803 --> 01:27:55,771
on fire, crackling...

970
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,335
You tried to cover me.

971
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:06,676
Over again, you put out the flames
that came off me.

972
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,512
I was grateful.

973
01:28:10,486 --> 01:28:15,719
But I knew we'd both die
if you kept on doing that.

974
01:28:15,858 --> 01:28:18,588
So I said, "Get out of here <i>!</i>"

975
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:20,820
You said, "No, I won't <i>!</i>"

976
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:25,189
So we repeated "Get out <i>!</i>"
"No, I won't."

977
01:28:26,769 --> 01:28:32,571
Then you said, "Okay, let's play
scissors-paper-rock.

978
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:39,775
"I'll put out a rock.
You don't have a prayer for winning."

979
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:46,720
Ready or not, here I go <i>!</i>

980
01:28:50,226 --> 01:28:51,420
There you go again.

981
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:54,289
I see through you.

982
01:28:55,097 --> 01:28:56,826
Since I was a kid...

983
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,829
You've let me win like this.

984
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:03,567
You were so kind...

985
01:29:03,706 --> 01:29:05,674
Why not put out paper?

986
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:09,744
Can't you see I want you to win?

987
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:13,908
Show a little respect for me
and run away.

988
01:29:14,483 --> 01:29:18,476
Do as your father says for
this one last time.

989
01:29:22,224 --> 01:29:28,686
If you don't run away,
I'll die on your right here and now.

990
01:29:42,278 --> 01:29:44,007
You see?

991
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:49,607
Both your surviving and
my dying were

992
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:52,679
based on a mutual agreement.

993
01:29:52,821 --> 01:29:57,849
But the fact is, I left you ther

994
01:29:57,993 --> 01:30:01,952
I should've died beside you.

995
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:03,724
You're so stupid <i>!</i>

996
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:08,635
How did you ever get so stupid, eh?

997
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:10,864
What did you learn at schools?

998
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:11,597
Uh, I...

999
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,469
Listen to me <i>!</i>

1000
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:21,242
When you were next to me,
you cried and told me

1001
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:25,715
how inhuman it all was

1002
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:29,354
that we had to part like this.

1003
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:31,723
Remember?

1004
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:37,722
Then I said to you...

1005
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:43,702
"A parting like this should
never happen again.

1006
01:30:44,807 --> 01:30:46,934
"It's not human."

1007
01:30:52,648 --> 01:30:58,883
Maybe you were able to hear
my last words...

1008
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:04,991
"Live my life for me too."

1009
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:15,496
So you will go on living
because of me.

1010
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:19,231
Go on living?

1011
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,569
Yes.

1012
01:31:22,678 --> 01:31:25,613
So that the world will remember...

1013
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:30,151
too many people have had to
say goodbye like that.

1014
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:36,053
Isn't your library to
tell people those things?

1015
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:44,857
Isn't your job to tell people
sad things and happy things?

1016
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:48,603
If you don't even know that...

1017
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:53,439
there's no way
I can ever depend on you.

1018
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:59,010
Have some other child instead.

1019
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,948
Some other child?

1020
01:32:07,456 --> 01:32:10,584
A grandchild...

1021
01:32:13,462 --> 01:32:14,690
A great grandchild.

1022
01:33:14,323 --> 01:33:18,419
When will I see you again?

1023
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:22,624
Depends on you.

1024
01:33:28,036 --> 01:33:31,870
Might be a while.

1025
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:54,153
I forgot to top up the firewood.

1026
01:34:05,274 --> 01:34:06,639
Daddy...

1027
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:11,045
