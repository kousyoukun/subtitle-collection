1
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,147
Hey!

2
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:18,379
What the...? Who's that?

3
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,360
You're dead.

4
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:23,593
- Who grabbed me? Who grabbed me?
- Watch out!

5
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:25,157
Who grabbed me?

6
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,266
- Honey, you're gonna be late.
- What'd you grab me for?

7
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:34,020
Mom, I can't find
my shoes for school.

8
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:35,792
They're under the couch.

9
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,773
Sit down. Yeah.

10
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:39,963
Dad, will you sign my permission slip
for tomorrow?

11
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,527
Give it to your mother.

12
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,821
Your mother's arms are full.

13
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,949
- You got time for pancakes?
- Nope.

14
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:48,409
Give us another one, Dad.

15
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:51,537
Secretary of Defense.

16
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,788
Dean Rusk.

17
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,603
Wrong. And you get
to wax my car.

18
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,523
Rusk is State, moron.
It's Robert McNamara.

19
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:00,296
Attorney General.

20
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,234
Too easy.

21
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,319
Yeah, it's Bobby Kennedy.

22
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:09,784
All right, wise guys. Assistant
Secretary of State for Latin America.

23
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:11,452
That's too hard.

24
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:14,580
Wait a minute.
This isn't a permission slip.

25
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:18,751
This is your report card.

26
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,088
Have you seen these grades?

27
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:23,443
No.

28
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,780
All right.
Gotta go. Be good.

29
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,576
You?

30
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:33,662
I'm talking to you later.

31
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,137
- Morning, Evelyn.
- Hi, Ken.

32
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:23,933
- Ooh, those candies are for the kids.
- Is that right?

33
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,934
- Morning, Floyd.
- Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.

34
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:00,636
- Morning, Jackie.
- Hi, Kenny.

35
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,409
- Want a schedule?
- No.

36
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:05,641
Why'd you cross
all my people off the list?

37
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:08,352
Because you don't have anybody
on it who means anything.

38
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:11,341
- No votes there. There's no money.
- It's a party, Kenny.

39
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:15,129
And the one thing we both can be sure of
is that you don't know how to have a party.

40
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:17,736
Well, party to you,
politics to me.

41
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,907
So, who do you want?
For real?

42
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,471
Everyone on my list.

43
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,139
I don't want to spend
an entire evening

44
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:28,580
pretending that your votes and money are
more interesting than they really are.

45
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:31,500
And I want my kids to stop eating
the candy in the Oval Office.

46
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,907
That's not me.

47
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,211
Then who is it?

48
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:35,879
I don't rat
on my friends.

49
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,050
Well, I'm going to take this whole
list thing up with your friend.

50
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:41,927
Are you trying
to go around me?

51
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:45,680
Go around you, over you,
through you?Whatever it takes.

52
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:48,078
You're starting to bug me.

53
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,434
Good.

54
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:50,998
I'll get back to you.

55
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:58,401
Top of the morning,
Mr. President.

56
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,757
Morning, Kenny.

57
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:02,468
Just ran into your wife.

58
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,283
- Want to talk about this party?
- No.

59
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,601
- You see Homer Capehart's tirade today?
- I did.

60
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,269
I don't see why he needs
to invent an issue.

61
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,250
He's got his election
sewn up.

62
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,753
Even so, we should
still go out for Bobby.

63
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,046
It's good groundwork
for us in '64.

64
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,549
Look into that, uh...

65
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:24,990
That Vietnam thing.

66
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:27,179
- What, the 2 planes that went down?
- Yeah.

67
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,995
It didn't make it
before press time.

68
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,872
I haven't taken a look
at the West Coast papers yet,

69
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,374
but I doubt we'll see
anything till tomorrow.

70
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:37,294
I was eating that.

71
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,317
- No, you weren't.
- I was.

72
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,924
- No, you weren't.
- I was.

73
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,138
I was, you bastard.

74
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,744
So, what do we got today?

75
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:51,996
Today.

76
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:03,986
That's it.

77
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,280
That's the one
we're looking for.

78
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:10,138
- I need to see the President, Kenny.
- All right.

79
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,309
2:30 to 2:45 or 4:30 to 5: 00.
Take your pick.

80
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,873
No, I need to see him
now, Ken.

81
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:21,504
You can go on up.
I'll let him know you're coming.

82
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:27,447
Coffee?

83
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,324
Yeah.

84
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:32,452
That's not what you said.

85
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:34,016
<i>What'd I say?
Tell me what I said.</i>

86
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,580
That's not what?

87
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:38,082
Listen to me, you
worthless piece of shit.

88
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,272
Now, you will put
Daley's man on the circuit,

89
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,149
and you'll do it today.

90
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,486
You owe your goddamn job
to this administration.

91
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,908
Yeah, I can—I can hear
how grateful you are,

92
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:52,784
but there's a word
you need to learn.

93
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,183
It's the only word
in politics.

94
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,998
It's called loyalty.
Loyalty!

95
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,752
Now, any part of this
you don't understand?

96
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:03,941
Good.

97
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,278
What?

98
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,780
This isn't the blessed order
of St. Mary the Meek.

99
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,179
Look, you better
come in here.

100
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,245
What was it you were saying
to me the other day about Cuba?

101
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:17,809
It wasn't important?

102
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,269
Not as far
as the election goes.

103
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:21,041
Mac, let's, uh...

104
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,023
Can I see that for a second?

105
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,734
Ken, you used to look down
a bombsight for a living.

106
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:29,696
Just ignore the labels.
What does that look like to you?

107
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:36,160
I don't know.

108
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:38,246
What is it?

109
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,748
On Sunday morning, one of
our U-2s took these pictures.

110
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:43,981
The Soviets are putting medium-range
ballistic missiles into Cuba.

111
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:47,422
They appear to be the SS-4,
range of 1000 miles,

112
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:49,924
3- megaton nuclear warheads.

113
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,322
Seen here in this year's
May Day Parade in Red Square.

114
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,142
Jesus Christ in heaven.

115
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,417
White House operator.

116
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:07,754
Yeah, Mr. O'Donnell, please,
for Secretary McNamara.

117
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:09,527
Go ahead, please.

118
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:12,446
White House operator.

119
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,574
I've got the President for the
Attorney General. Go ahead, please.

120
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:17,243
What the crap
is going on today?

121
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:18,181
That's right. That's right.

122
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,475
The principals
are assembling in an hour.

123
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:22,143
We'll see you then.

124
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:23,811
Where's Bobby?

125
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,522
- He should be here any minute.
- Well, good.

126
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:32,257
Good.

127
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,011
Where the hell are you?

128
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:37,471
We're in here.

129
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,779
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell
is Khrushchev thinking?

130
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:46,751
You have any indication of this
from your KGB pal Bolshakov?

131
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:48,940
Any possible warning,
sense of motivation?

132
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,087
Complete snow job.

133
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:51,651
And then we went out
and told the country

134
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,841
they weren't putting
missiles into Cuba.

135
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:55,926
Jesus, I...

136
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,472
I feel like we caught the Jap carrier
steaming for Pearl Harbor.

137
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:25,017
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

138
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:27,103
- Mr. Secretary.
- Mr. President.

139
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,875
Bob, I'll bet you
had a late night.

140
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,648
Sleep is for the weak,
Mr. President.

141
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,212
- Max.
- Mr. President.

142
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:34,089
The CIA's been notified.

143
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,487
McCone's on his way back
from the West Coast.

144
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,677
He's been burying
his stepson.

145
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:41,075
General Carter
is here, though.

146
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,393
- Ted.
- Kenny.

147
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,257
OK.

148
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:52,962
Let's have it.

149
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:54,526
Arthur?

150
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:57,028
Gentlemen,
as most of you now know,

151
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,948
a U-2 over Cuba
Sunday morning

152
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:02,033
took a series
of disturbing photographs.

153
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,431
Our analysis at NPIC
indicates

154
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:06,412
that the Soviet Union
has followed up

155
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:09,540
its conventional weapons
buildup in Cuba

156
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:12,356
with the introduction
of surface-to-surface

157
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:16,631
medium-range
ballistic missiles, or MRBMs.

158
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,716
Our official estimate
at this time

159
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,678
is that this missile system
is the SS-4 Sandal.

160
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:27,162
We do not believe that the missiles
are as yet operational.

161
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,186
Ironbark reports
that the SS-4 can deliver

162
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,835
a 3-megaton nuclear weapon
1000 miles.

163
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,755
So far, we've identified
32 missiles

164
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,257
serviced by about 3,400 men,

165
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,177
undoubtedly
all Soviet personnel.

166
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:44,262
Our cities
and military installations

167
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,911
in the Southeast as far north
as Washington, D.C.

168
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,205
Are in range of these weapons

169
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:53,855
and in the event of a launch would
have only 5 minutes of warning.

170
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,106
5 minutes, gentlemen.

171
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,068
In those 5 minutes, they
could kill 80 million Americans

172
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:03,135
and destroy a significant
percentage of our bomber bases,

173
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,950
degrading our
retaliatory options.

174
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,078
The Joint Chiefs'
consensus, Mr. President,

175
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:13,457
is that this signals a major
doctrinal shift in Soviet thinking

176
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,168
to a first-strike policy.

177
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,818
It is a massively
destabilizing move.

178
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,320
How long until
they're operational?

179
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,823
General Taylor can answer
that question better than I can.

180
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,847
GMAC—Guided Missiles
Intelligence Committee?

181
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,349
estimates 10 to 14 days.

182
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,790
A crash program
could limit that time,

183
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:37,544
however, I must stress
that there may be more missiles

184
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,629
that we don't know about.

185
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,714
We need more U-2 coverage.

186
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:44,217
Gentlemen,
I want first reactions here.

187
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:47,449
Assuming for the moment that
Khrushchev has not gone off the deep end

188
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:50,473
and intends to start World War Ill,
what are we looking at?

189
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:51,933
Well, Mr. President,

190
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:54,435
I believe my team
is in agreement.

191
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,521
If we permit the introduction
of nuclear missiles

192
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,232
to a Soviet satellite nation
in our hemisphere,

193
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,464
the diplomatic
consequences would be...

194
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,758
too terrible to contemplate.

195
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,113
The Russians are trying
to show the world

196
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:07,782
they can do whatever they want,
wherever they want,

197
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:10,493
and we're powerless to stop them.
If they succeed...

198
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,370
It'll be Munich all over again.

199
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:15,498
Yes. Appeasement only makes
the aggressor more aggressive.

200
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:19,251
And the Soviets will be
emboldened to push us even harder.

201
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:22,379
Now, we must remove the missiles
one way or another.

202
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:24,360
Now, it seems to me
the options are either

203
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,237
some combination of
international pressure

204
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:29,574
and action on our part
till they give in,

205
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,034
Or...

206
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,223
We hit them?

207
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,892
An air strike.

208
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:36,664
Bob?

209
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,340
We worked up
several military scenarios.

210
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,191
Before I ask General Taylor to
take us through the various options,

211
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:44,484
I'd like for us to adopt a rule.

212
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:46,466
If we decide to strike,

213
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,447
we must agree now to do it

214
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:51,262
before the missiles
become operational,

215
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,599
because once they are, I don't think
we can guarantee getting them all

216
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,267
before at least?

217
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,561
At least some of them
are launched.

218
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,002
Well, it's clear
we cannot permit

219
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,191
Soviet nuclear missiles
in Cuba.

220
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,950
We have to get
those missiles out.

221
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:17,121
You know, I don't think it's going to
matter what Khrushchev's intentions are.

222
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,145
I can tell you right now,

223
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,438
I don't see any way
around hitting them.

224
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,671
If we hit 'em, kill a lot of
Russians, they'll move against Berlin.

225
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:27,756
All right,
they attack Berlin,

226
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,529
that's NATO, and we're at war.

227
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,718
We're damned if we do,
but if we don't,

228
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,221
we're in a war for sure
somewhere else in 6 months.

229
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:36,306
Well, if there are
alternatives that make sense,

230
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,975
and I'm not saying
that there are,

231
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,434
then we need them,
and we need them fast.

232
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:40,894
All right.
What about Congress?

233
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:43,292
Now, I think we may need
to start letting key people know,

234
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,690
and they're all scattered across
the country for the campaign.

235
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:46,837
We can get Congress back.

236
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,027
We're gonna need to get the U.N.
Stomping and warmed up.

237
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,695
What about the allies?

238
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,155
We can't start worrying
about everything.

239
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,823
Right now we got to
figure out what we're gonna do

240
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:55,909
before we worry about
how we're gonna do it.

241
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,681
We've got a bunch
of smart guys.

242
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,975
We lock 'em in a room
and kick 'em in the ass

243
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,165
until they come up
with some solutions.

244
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,231
I'll do it.

245
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,341
It's too politicized
with you in there anyway.

246
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,113
They need to be able
to stick their necks out.

247
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,782
Yeah. It'll be the principals,

248
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,388
a couple of the key guys
from each Department?

249
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,933
The Executive Committee
of the National Security Council.

250
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,749
Call it EXCOM.

251
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:25,521
OK.

252
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,649
So, I'm only gonna show for the
meetings that you call me into.

253
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,735
And impress us.

254
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,612
Do it fast.

255
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:35,427
And, Kenny, you're gonna be in
charge of keeping this thing quiet.

256
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,242
I mean, if word gets out before
we know what we're gonna do,

257
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:39,702
there's gonna be panic.

258
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:41,579
And it's gonna ruin
any chance we might have

259
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,456
at surprise if we decide
to hit them.

260
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,958
We're gonna need to do
a few things right away.

261
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,835
No Pierre.

262
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,442
He knows, the press knows.

263
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,840
And you're gonna have
to keep up your schedule.

264
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,925
Your movements
are followed too closely.

265
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,115
Well, George Ball's got
a conference room at State.

266
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,409
Good. You meet over there
this afternoon.

267
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,537
We'll figure out some way to sneak
you guys back in here tonight.

268
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,144
I think we should
bring in Dean Acheson.

269
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,566
Kenny, he was fighting Soviets while we
were still playing ball together at school.

270
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:14,528
Find him, Kenny.

271
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,864
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

272
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,874
Screw secrecy.

273
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:31,211
You try having that fat ass sit on
your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom.

274
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:34,026
You were excited.
I say no more.

275
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,015
Everybody agrees
the diplomatic route won't work.

276
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,178
It's too slow, and they'll have the
missiles finished while we're still talking.

277
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:44,349
I hear old Warren Harding used to
get his girls in through here.

278
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,538
We have 850 planes

279
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,875
assembling at Homestead,
Eglin, Opa Locka,

280
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,150
MacDill, Patrick,
Pensacola, and Key West.

281
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,409
Due to
the tropical foliage,

282
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:58,217
the OPLAN calls
for high explosive

283
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,345
and napalm load-outs for
our ground-attack sorties.

284
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,951
I still think there are
diplomatic approaches

285
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,203
we haven't considered yet.

286
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:07,497
Jesus, Adlai,
peace at any price?

287
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,373
We have a gun to our head.

288
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,632
We have high confidence

289
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:14,587
in the expanded air-strike
option, Mr. President.

290
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:18,028
The problem is, sir, is that
it's a short-term solution.

291
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:21,052
Khrushchev can send in
more missiles next month.

292
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,928
The Chiefs and I believe

293
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,910
we should follow up
the air strikes

294
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,203
with a full version
of OPLAN 316.

295
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:29,289
- An invasion?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,478
We can be sure
we get all the missiles,

297
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,815
and we remove Castro
so this can never happen again.

298
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,005
Is this the Joint Chiefs'
recommendation?

299
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:40,619
Yes, sir. Our best option,
as Bob pointed out this morning,

300
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:44,616
would be to commence the strikes
before the missiles become operational.

301
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,640
The invasion happens 8 days later.

302
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:51,394
Dean...

303
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:53,896
What do you think?

304
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,816
Gentlemen,
for the last 15 years,

305
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,588
I've fought here at this table

306
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,257
alongside your predecessors

307
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,864
in the struggle
against the Soviet.

308
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,366
Now, I do not wish
to seem melodramatic,

309
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,347
but I do wish
to impress upon you

310
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:10,997
a lesson I learned with
bitter tears and great sacrifice.

311
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,812
The Soviet understands
only one language—Action.

312
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,565
Respects only
one word—Force.

313
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:19,964
I concur with General Taylor.

314
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:22,570
I recommend, sir, air strikes
followed by invasion,

315
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,158
perhaps preceded by an ultimatum
to dismantle the missiles

316
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:28,931
if that is militarily viable.

317
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,433
So, it appears
we have 3 options.

318
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:33,988
Number one?
A surgical air strike

319
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:36,230
against the missiles themselves.

320
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:40,088
2—A much larger air strike
against their air defenses

321
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,007
along with the missiles,
and 3?

322
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,093
Invasion.

323
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:47,699
So, we're certainly
gonna do number one.

324
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,680
We're gonna take
these missiles out.

325
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:51,870
It seems to me
we can't wait very long.

326
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:54,060
We should at least be
making those preparations.

327
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,771
We're preparing to
implement all 3 options,

328
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,230
though I must stress again, sir,

329
00:21:58,335 --> 00:21:59,899
there are risks to the strikes

330
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,845
without the follow-on
invasion.

331
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,131
You want to be clear,
Mr. President,

332
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,634
that we've definitely decided
against a political track.

333
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,430
Dean, uh...

334
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:15,018
How does this all play out?

335
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:16,686
Your first step, sir,
will be to demand

336
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:20,544
that the Soviet withdraw the
missiles within 12 to 24 hours.

337
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:22,525
They will refuse.

338
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,549
When they do, you will order the
strikes, followed by the invasion.

339
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,781
They will resist and be overrun.

340
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,180
They will retaliate
against another target

341
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:33,682
somewhere else in the world,
most likely Berlin.

342
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:36,497
We will honor
our treaty commitments

343
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,270
and resist them there,

344
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,564
defeating them per our plans.

345
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,526
Those plans call for
the use of nuclear weapons.

346
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:54,119
So what is the...
What is the next step?

347
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,308
Hopefully, cooler heads
will prevail

348
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:58,498
before we reach the next step.

349
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,546
Thank you, gentlemen.

350
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,124
What happened in there?

351
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:23,418
I thought he was gonna
give us his decision.

352
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:25,608
Look, I know them. They just need
to make sure there's no other way.

353
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:26,651
They'll get there.

354
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,362
Remember that Kennedy's father
was one of the architects of Munich.

355
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,864
There's only one
responsible choice here,

356
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:34,262
so let's hope appeasement
doesn't run in families.

357
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,452
I fear weakness does.

358
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,870
Jesus Christ.

359
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:04,709
Call—Call me Irish,

360
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:07,211
but I don't believe
in cooler heads prevailing.

361
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:09,922
- You know, they think I froze in there.
- You didn't freeze.

362
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:12,633
You did exactly what you should've
done. You stayed out of the corner.

363
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:13,676
You didn't decide.

364
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,179
Well, Acheson's
scenario is just?

365
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,473
It's unacceptable, and he's got
more experience than any of them.

366
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:20,141
There is no expert
on the subject.

367
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:22,956
I mean, there is no
wise old man. There's?

368
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:25,250
Shit. There's just us.

369
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:28,274
The thing is
that Acheson's right.

370
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:30,046
Talk alone is not gonna
accomplish anything.

371
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:33,904
Well, let's bomb
the shit out of 'em.

372
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:37,762
Everybody wants to.
I mean, even you.

373
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:39,431
I mean, even me.

374
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,350
Right? It sure would
feel good.

375
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,914
And, Jack,

376
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:46,521
I'm as conniving
as they come, but

377
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:48,711
a sneak attack is just wrong.

378
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:51,109
Things are happening too fast.
I mean, this is starting to smell

379
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:52,881
like the Bay of Pigs
all over again.

380
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:55,801
Well, tonight, listening
to Taylor and Acheson,

381
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:59,138
I kept seeing Lemnitzer
and Dulles telling me

382
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:01,223
all I had to do was
sign on the dotted line,

383
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:03,934
and the invasion would
succeed, and Castro?

384
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,958
And Castro would be gone.

385
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,981
Just—easy?
Just like that.

386
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:16,863
You know, there's something...

387
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:21,764
immoral about abandoning
your own judgment.

388
00:25:25,518 --> 00:25:27,290
We just can't let this
get out of hand.

389
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:30,418
And we're gonna do
whatever we have to do

390
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:31,982
and make this come out right.

391
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:38,760
- I'm gonna stay here tomorrow.
- No, you can't.

392
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:41,158
Remember, we talked about this,
your schedule.

393
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,182
The best thing you can do
tomorrow is go to Connecticut.

394
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:46,059
He's right.

395
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,751
Yeah.

396
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:52,732
Jesus.

397
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:10,875
Doesn't anybody in Connecticut
have to work today?

398
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:13,899
I love you, JFK!

399
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,700
The full spectrum
of air strikes

400
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:26,202
is the minimum response
the Joint Chiefs will accept.

401
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:28,392
No, no, no!

402
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,311
Now, there is more
than one option here,

403
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,440
And if one isn't occurring to us, it's
because we haven't thought hard enough.

404
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:36,838
Bobby, sometimes there
is only one right choice,

405
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:39,132
and you thank God
when it's so clear.

406
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,426
You're talking
about a sneak attack.

407
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,094
How will that make us look?

408
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:46,848
A big country blasting
a little one into the Stone Age.

409
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:48,516
Oh, we'll be
everyone's favorite.

410
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,976
Come on, Bobby, that's naive.

411
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,609
This is the real world.

412
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:52,999
You know that better than anybody.

413
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:56,128
And you weren't so ethically particular
when we were talking about options

414
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:58,839
for removing Castro over at CIA.

415
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:12,602
Bob...

416
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,626
If we go ahead
with these air strikes,

417
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,754
you know what it'll
come to in the end.

418
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:21,361
There has got
to be something else.

419
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:22,716
Give it to me.

420
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,991
Now, I don't care how crazy,
inadequate, or stupid it sounds.

421
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,015
Give it to me.

422
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:33,108
6 months ago,
we gamed out a scenario.

423
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:35,437
It's slow. It doesn't
get rid of the missiles.

424
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,314
It's got a lot of drawbacks.

425
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:44,717
The scenario calls
for a blockade of Cuba.

426
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,396
The situation
is worse than we thought.

427
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:21,315
We now count 40 missiles.

428
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:22,462
40 missiles.

429
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:26,320
Longer range IRBMs.

430
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:29,136
They can hit every place
in the country

431
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,283
except Seattle.

432
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:32,159
Mr. President,

433
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:34,245
you give me
the order right now,

434
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:35,705
my planes will be
ready to carry out

435
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,999
the air strikes in 3 days time.

436
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,875
All you gotta do is say go.

437
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,586
My boys will get
those red bastards.

438
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,278
General, how long
until the Army's ready?

439
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,345
We've just begun the mobilization under
cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir.

440
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,430
We're looking at another
week and a half.

441
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,933
But you can order the strikes now.

442
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:59,269
The plans call for
an 8-day air campaign.

443
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:02,710
It'll light a fire under
the Army's ass to get in place.

444
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:06,673
General LeMay, do you truly believe
that's our best course of action?

445
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:09,592
Mr. President, I believe
it is the only course of action.

446
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,782
America is in danger.

447
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:14,076
Those missiles are
a threat to our bomber bases

448
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,057
and the safety
of our nuclear deterrent.

449
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,412
Now, without our deterrent,

450
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:20,749
there's nothing to keep the enemy
from choosing general nuclear war.

451
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:23,668
It's our duty, sir,

452
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:25,754
our responsibility
to the American people

453
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,318
to take out those missiles

454
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:30,550
and return stability to
the strategic situation.

455
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,053
The big red dog is
digging in our backyard,

456
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,103
and we are justified
in shooting him.

457
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:39,726
Sir, we have a rapidly closing
window of opportunity

458
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,645
where we can prevent those missiles
from ever becoming operational.

459
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,608
The other options
do not guarantee

460
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:49,631
the end result that
we can guarantee.

461
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,203
However, as more time goes by,

462
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:55,158
the less reliable the choice
we can offer you becomes.

463
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,000
Mr. President,

464
00:29:57,035 --> 00:29:59,016
the motto I chose for SAC

465
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,580
is "Peace is our Profession. "

466
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,125
Now, God forbid we find
ourselves in a nuclear exchange,

467
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:06,106
but if launched,
those missiles from Cuba

468
00:30:06,315 --> 00:30:08,608
would kill a lot of Americans.

469
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,798
The very presence
of those missiles

470
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:12,884
gives the Soviets
first-strike capability.

471
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,533
Those missiles make
a nuclear exchange more likely,

472
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:19,522
and that is why I'm being
such a pain in the ass

473
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:22,476
about destroying them and
dstroying them immediately.

474
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:25,396
Hell, even Mac agrees.

475
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:31,652
And, sir, given your own
statements about Cuba,

476
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:36,657
I think a blockade
or a bunch of political talk

477
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:39,055
would be considered by a lot
of our friends and neutrals

478
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:41,036
as a pretty weak response.

479
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:44,790
I suspect that many
of our own citizens

480
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,667
might feel the same way.

481
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:51,046
You're in a pretty bad fix,
Mr. President.

482
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:55,634
What did you say?

483
00:30:58,032 --> 00:30:59,596
You're in a pretty bad fix.

484
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,497
Maybe you haven't noticed
you're in it with me.

485
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:10,649
Now, General, what
are the Soviets gonna do

486
00:31:10,857 --> 00:31:11,691
when we attack?

487
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:14,819
Nothing.

488
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:16,696
Nothing?

489
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:17,947
Nothing,

490
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,971
because the only
alternative open to them

491
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,099
is one they can't choose.

492
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,227
You know, they're?

493
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:30,043
They're not just missiles
we're gonna be destroying, General.

494
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:34,005
If we kill Soviet soldiers,
they're gonna respond.

495
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:37,863
I mean, how would we respond
if they killed ours?

496
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:41,408
No, they're gonna do something,
General. I can promise you that.

497
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:47,456
Those goddamn Kennedys are
gonna destroy this country

498
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,645
if we don't do something
about this.

499
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:52,461
We're headed out to the backyard

500
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:54,859
to take a look
for that big red dog.

501
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,736
Thanks, Bob.

502
00:31:57,153 --> 00:31:59,030
I was hoping LeMay pushed you,

503
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,115
because I was ready to knock
that son of a bitch across the room.

504
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,096
We knew it was coming.
And I'll tell you one thing, Kenny,

505
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,286
those brass heads
have one big advantage.

506
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,745
That is, if we do
what they want us to do,

507
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:09,665
there's none of us gonna be left
alive to tell 'em they were wrong.

508
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,002
Mr. President, we need to
go over what you're going to say.

509
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,087
Gromyko should be
on his way by now.

510
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,547
Now, there's still
no sign that they know

511
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:17,902
that we know
about the missiles.

512
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:19,675
Well, we're gonna
keep it that way.

513
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:37,088
Kenny?

514
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:38,652
I'll be right there.

515
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,406
I'm getting funny questions
from the guys.

516
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,074
Yeah? What sort of questions?

517
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,263
About some sort
of military exercises?

518
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,036
You want me to do my job
handling the press,

519
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:49,809
I need to know what's going on.

520
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:52,832
- Military exercises?
- Yeah, military exercises.

521
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:55,231
Haven't heard anything about it.

522
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:56,273
Ask Bundy.

523
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:58,359
I did. He said to ask you.

524
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,008
Mr. Gromyko,
this way, please.

525
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:04,823
Mr. Dobrynin, what are
your hopes for the meeting?

526
00:33:05,136 --> 00:33:07,430
Mr. Gromyko, can you give us
a statement, please?

527
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,141
Robert.

528
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:12,644
- Hugh, how are you?
- Good.

529
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,196
Excuse me, Joan.

530
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:20,360
So, tell me about this military exercise
that's going on down in Puerto Rico.

531
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:21,402
What?

532
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:25,782
It's called ORTSAC, I believe.
Castro spelled backwards.

533
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:29,535
ORTSAC? I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

534
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,725
Me, either. Why?

535
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:34,332
Well, because maybe the President
and Gromyko are gonna talk about it.

536
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,043
If you're trying to drum
something up, Johnny, forget it.

537
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,545
This meeting's been
on the books for months.

538
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:43,090
Far as I know, it's just a friendly
talk on U.S. -Soviet relations.

539
00:33:44,341 --> 00:33:45,905
Sir! Sir!

540
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:47,991
Mr. President!

541
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:52,892
All right, hold it, guys. Hold it.
You'll get your pictures.

542
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:54,768
Does it?

543
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:57,792
Mm-hmm.

544
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,669
I'll be damned.

545
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,631
Kind of simple for the Pentagon.

546
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:10,930
What is this meeting about, sir?

547
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:14,162
Sir!

548
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:16,248
Mr. Gromyko,
thank you for coming.

549
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:17,812
Hold on, guys. One minute.

550
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:25,423
Gentlemen, would you mind
shaking hands?

551
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:29,073
So that there should be
no misunderstanding

552
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:31,019
the position
of the United States,

553
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:34,599
which has been made clear by the Attorney
General to Ambassador Dobrynin here,

554
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:38,144
I shall read a sentence from my statement
to the press dated September 13th.

555
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,168
"Should missiles
or offensive weapons

556
00:34:41,272 --> 00:34:42,906
"be placed in Cuba,

557
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:44,609
"it would present
the gravest threat

558
00:34:44,713 --> 00:34:46,486
to U.S. National security. "

559
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,258
Mr. President,

560
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:51,491
as Premier Khrushchev's own statement
of September 13th assured you,

561
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,159
our military assistance
to Cuba

562
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:55,870
is of a defensive nature only.

563
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:03,795
So I do not
misunderstand you,

564
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:07,131
There are no offensive
weapons in Cuba?

565
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,364
Premier Khrushchev's
statement of September 13th

566
00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:13,075
remains the position
of the Soviet Government.

567
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,577
To that,
I have nothing to add.

568
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,497
Well, that's good enough for me.

569
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:20,165
Thanks so much.

570
00:35:20,478 --> 00:35:21,937
Thank you.

571
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:26,942
Gentlemen, if you'll
come with me, please.

572
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:29,236
A most constructive meeting.

573
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,308
- What happened?
- Lying bastard.

574
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:39,663
Lied right to my face.

575
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,123
We're split down the middle.

576
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:44,042
If I held a vote, I think air strike
would beat blockade by a vote or two.

577
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:46,858
I want a consensus. I mean,
either air strike or blockade,

578
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,526
but something everyone's
going to stand by,

579
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,716
even if they don't like it.

580
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:54,782
I need it by Saturday.
Make it happen.

581
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,346
What if I can't?

582
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,413
We go into this split,
the Russians will know it.

583
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,498
They'll know it
and use it against us.

584
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,209
Have you canceled Chicago
and the rest of the weekend yet?

585
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:08,441
If you don't show for Chicago, everyone'll
know there's something going on.

586
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,944
- I don't care. Just cancel it.
- Forget it!

587
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:15,532
I'm not calling
and canceling on Daley.

588
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:20,015
You call and cancel on Daley.

589
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,475
You're scared
to cancel on Daley?

590
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,978
You're damn right
I'm scared.

591
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,836
Well, I'm not.

592
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:33,466
Watch this.

593
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:36,594
Welcome to Chicago,
Mr. President.

594
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:39,305
Mr. Mayor, I wouldn't miss
this event for the world.

595
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,182
Mr. President, over here!

596
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,955
Mayor Daley!

597
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,666
Let's go.

598
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:48,168
Tonight, you're going to
experience some true Midwest...

599
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:49,732
Kenny! What's going on?

600
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,173
Now the guys are hounding me about
some troop movements in Florida?

601
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:54,476
What are you telling them?

602
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:55,571
The truth?I don't know.

603
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:57,761
- Am I out of the loop on something?
- No.

604
00:36:58,803 --> 00:37:02,349
Tell them you've looked into it,
and all it is is an exercise.

605
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,851
Oh, and, Pierre,

606
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:07,041
Tomorrow, the President
may have a cold.

607
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:08,918
- A what?
- A cold.

608
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,818
Kenny, do I get
any input around here?

609
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,259
Yeah.

610
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:19,345
How bad it is is up to you.

611
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,980
You know, there are major
rail disruptions in the South.

612
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,065
2 Airborne Divisions
are on alert.

613
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,402
Sounds to me like that
exercise is an invasion.

614
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:37,800
Well, you know how Bobby has it
in for the state of Mississippi.

615
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:40,094
We're invading Cuba.

616
00:37:40,615 --> 00:37:42,909
Damn it, we are not
invading Cuba.

617
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:44,682
Are you crazy?

618
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:46,767
Nobody gives
a rat's ass about Cuba?

619
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:48,540
Not now, not ever.

620
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:51,772
If you print something like that, all
you're going to do is inflame the situation.

621
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:55,630
Nobody talks to assholes
who inflame situations.

622
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,924
Assholes like that
can find themselves

623
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,801
cut out of the loop.

624
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,720
That's the first time
you've ever threatened me.

625
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,683
All right.

626
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,768
I won't print anything
until I have another source,

627
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,645
But I promise you,
I'll get one.

628
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:16,797
Bobby.

629
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:18,778
<i>We've got a consensus
for a blockade,</i>

630
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:22,219
but it won't last past tomorrow,
Kenny. You have to bring him back.

631
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:25,243
<i>Oh, by the way,
China invaded India today.</i>

632
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:27,224
You're kidding, aren't you?

633
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:30,352
I wish I were. Galbraith's
handling it in New Delhi.

634
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,750
<i>Makes you wonder
what's coming next.</i>

635
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:36,921
Jesus, what is it about the free world
that pisses the rest of the world off?

636
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:39,215
I don't know.
We have Tupperware parties?

637
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:41,404
Maybe.

638
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,073
I'll see you tomorrow.

639
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,324
<i>OK.</i>

640
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:45,888
The President has a cold.

641
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:47,869
He's canceling
the remainder of this trip

642
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:50,684
and returning to Washington
on the advice of his doctor.

643
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:52,874
President Kennedy!

644
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:54,751
Is it true
you have a cold, sir?

645
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:56,732
How do you feel,
Mr. President?

646
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,087
Mr. President!

647
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:01,528
What's the next step going
to be, Mr. President?

648
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:11,330
Mr. President,

649
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:13,415
our deliberations have
led us to the conclusion

650
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,543
that a blockade
of offensive weapons to Cuba

651
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,524
is our best option.

652
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:21,965
A strong showing of support from
the Organization of American States

653
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,842
would give us
an umbrella of legitimacy.

654
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:26,136
A blockade is technically
an act of war.

655
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:28,326
Therefore, we recommend
calling the action

656
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,368
a quarantine.

657
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:33,018
Let's hope that translates into
Russian the way we want it to.

658
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:37,293
There are between
20 and 30 Soviet ships

659
00:39:37,397 --> 00:39:39,587
underway to Cuba at this time.

660
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:43,201
800 miles out, the Navy
will stop them, board,

661
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:46,364
and any vessels containing weapons
will be turned back.

662
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:49,284
A quarantine prevents any
more missiles from reaching Cuba,

663
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,786
but it doesn't remove
the missiles already there.

664
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,540
It gives the Soviets a chance
to pull back without a war.

665
00:39:55,748 --> 00:39:58,042
If they refuse
to remove the missiles,

666
00:39:58,077 --> 00:40:00,336
we retain the option
to strike and invade.

667
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,213
A sneak attack would be counter

668
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,611
to what the United States
stands for.

669
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,488
It leaves us no room
to maneuver,

670
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:10,137
and the inevitable Soviet response
would force us into a war.

671
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:12,119
Mr. President,
there are still those of us

672
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:15,142
who believe we should
proceed with the strikes.

673
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,645
Sir, with a blockade,
we lose strategic surprise.

674
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,939
We also run the risk
of the Soviets launching

675
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:21,920
a first strike against us
if they decide

676
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:24,005
they have to use
the missiles or lose them.

677
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,574
So, quarantine or air strike.

678
00:40:30,783 --> 00:40:33,494
Ahem. There is a third option.

679
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:35,788
With either course,

680
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,603
we undertake
the risk of nuclear war.

681
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,044
So it seems to me that
maybe one of us in this room

682
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,608
should be a coward,

683
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,840
So I guess I'll be.

684
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:50,594
A third course
is to strike a deal.

685
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:53,513
We trade Guantanamo
and our missiles in Turkey,

686
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,912
get them to pull
their missiles out.

687
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:57,997
We employ a back channel.

688
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:00,917
We attribute the idea
to U Thant.

689
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:04,045
U Thant then raises it
at the U.N.

690
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,528
I don't think
that's possible, Adlai.

691
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,472
I've not yet made
my final decision.

692
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,078
I'll be asking the Networks
for airtime on Monday night.

693
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,894
We'll announce
our course of action then.

694
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,334
Ted, I want you to get
working on speeches

695
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:25,524
for both quarantine
and air strike.

696
00:41:27,922 --> 00:41:30,425
Well, thank you for
all your advice, gentlemen.

697
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,344
I did hear Adlai.

698
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:36,472
Jesus, you'd think nobody learned
anything from World War II.

699
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,897
Somebody had to say it.

700
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:40,435
I respect Adlai for having the guts
to risk looking like an appeaser.

701
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:42,103
We have to pull him.

702
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:44,814
He's not going to be able to handle
the Soviets in front of the U.N.

703
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:46,482
Zorin will eat him alive.

704
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,463
We've got bigger
problems right now.

705
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,444
Ladies?

706
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,904
No, thank you.

707
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,473
Honey, I'll be right back.

708
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:07,649
Adlai?

709
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:12,967
Ah. I just can't seem
to get away from you guys.

710
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,260
Escaping for a night
on the town, eh?

711
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,311
As D.C.'s most popular playboy,

712
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:21,308
the President felt my presence
would be sorely missed, so

713
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:24,853
in the interest of
National Security, here I am.

714
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,356
Yes, gotta keep up appearances.

715
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,441
Of course, I don't anymore.

716
00:42:31,526 --> 00:42:33,820
I'm a political dead man.

717
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:36,114
Did you ever see anyone
cut his own throat

718
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,783
like I did today?

719
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:40,702
No, no.

720
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:42,683
It's all right.

721
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,811
And by the way,
I spoke to a friend.

722
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,522
Reston and Franco have the story.

723
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:51,129
The Times is going to
run it tomorrow.

724
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,300
We're not gonna make it to Monday.

725
00:42:55,717 --> 00:42:56,551
Shit.

726
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,810
<i>We can get Sorenson
to lean on Reston,</i>

727
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,930
But you're gonna have
to call Orville Dryfoos.

728
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:03,850
This is the sort of decision
a publisher makes himself.

729
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:07,082
All right.
Thanks, Kenny.

730
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:11,462
Yes, sir, I understand, but, you
know, we held on the Bay of Pigs,

731
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:14,277
and it was the biggest mistake of
my life. What makes this different?

732
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:15,910
Orville, I'm asking you
to hold the story

733
00:43:15,945 --> 00:43:19,282
until I can present our course
of action on Monday night.

734
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:24,182
All right, but I'm gonna need
a reason to give my boys.

735
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:26,268
They're gonna be screaming
for my head on a plate.

736
00:43:26,372 --> 00:43:28,040
<i>Listen, Orville,
you tell them this?/i>

737
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:30,856
That they'll
be saving lives...

738
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,045
including their own.

739
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:36,590
Yes, Mr. President.

740
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:06,829
How many Congressmen
have not responded yet?

741
00:44:07,037 --> 00:44:08,288
14.

742
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,999
<i>- Boggs is in the Gulf fishing?
- Yes, sir.</i>

743
00:44:11,104 --> 00:44:12,876
I thought he was supposed
to be campaigning.

744
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,127
<i>Well, he's not gone for long.</i>

745
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:17,464
Jesus. Get a plane out
there and get him back.

746
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:21,009
He wants to talk to LeMay again.

747
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:22,782
He's still considering
air strikes.

748
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,668
None of this works tomorrow.

749
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,275
- Figure out how to cancel it.
- Yes, sir.

750
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:40,820
We're on the phones.

751
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:53,333
Cam, can you guarantee me
you'll get all the missiles?

752
00:44:57,712 --> 00:45:00,214
Sir, I guarantee we'll get
all the missiles we know about.

753
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,864
Mr. President, we can get
better than 90%of them.

754
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:11,371
I'll brief the Congressional leadership
tomorrow evening at 5:00.

755
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:16,063
At 7:00, all United States
Armed Forces worldwide

756
00:45:16,689 --> 00:45:18,774
will stand up to DEFCON 3.

757
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,798
I have a brief statement
to make.

758
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:24,405
President Kennedy will
address the nation tonight

759
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:25,656
on radio and television

760
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,888
on a subject of
the highest national urgency.

761
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:32,329
He has requested airtime
on all 3 Networks for 7 p. m.

762
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:33,685
Thank you very much.

763
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,217
I am not willing
to support anything

764
00:46:06,321 --> 00:46:07,781
but the toughest possible?

765
00:46:07,885 --> 00:46:10,805
Congress cannot give you
the support you're looking for.

766
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:12,681
Mr. President! Sir?

767
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:15,497
If they want this goddamn
job, they can have it.

768
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:16,748
It's no great joy to me.

769
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:18,103
Mr. President,
here's the speech.

770
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,355
I made those changes you wanted.

771
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,336
- I need a minute.
- Kenny, no.

772
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,691
A minute.

773
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:29,990
Look, I don't want
a goddamn pep talk.

774
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,493
You're not the Harvard
quarterback anymore.

775
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:34,057
We're on the brink here!

776
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:37,289
They're trying to second-guess me into
World War 3. Well, it's not gonna happen.

777
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,687
- What did you think Congress was gonna do?
- Well, I...

778
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:42,085
Offer you
unconditional support?

779
00:46:42,502 --> 00:46:44,379
Kiss your Catholic ass?

780
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:47,195
They don't think we even
deserve to be here.

781
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:49,071
Well, what the hell
do you think?

782
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:51,053
I think we haven't been
that impressive today.

783
00:46:51,157 --> 00:46:53,555
They have good reason
to question our judgment.

784
00:46:53,764 --> 00:46:55,328
What do you want, Kenny?

785
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,517
I want you to sit down.

786
00:46:57,621 --> 00:46:59,394
Well, I'm not going to sit down!

787
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,479
I want you to sit down,

788
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:02,835
loosen your tie,
and take a minute?

789
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:04,086
I haven't got a minute!

790
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,693
You're the President
of the United States.

791
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:08,987
They can wait for you.

792
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,286
Well, why not?

793
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:20,978
Things can't get much worse.

794
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:23,376
Oh, I don't know.
We could have to...

795
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,025
go down to Lyndon's ranch again
dressed up as cowboys.

796
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:32,030
Shoot deer out of the back
of his Convertible.

797
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:36,305
That was a bad day.

798
00:47:40,163 --> 00:47:42,144
You know, I thought
there'd be...

799
00:47:42,353 --> 00:47:44,126
more good days.

800
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:49,652
You know, back when
we were in the wards,

801
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:53,197
that day Bobby made me
come down and meet you?

802
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:55,804
I didn't get you at first.

803
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:58,932
I thought you were lucky.

804
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,956
Your father had a lot of money.

805
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:05,709
You were skinny.
Girls loved you.

806
00:48:06,648 --> 00:48:09,254
I thought I could beat
you and Bobby up together.

807
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:16,032
But he just kept going
on and on about you.

808
00:48:17,075 --> 00:48:19,056
I thought it was because
he was your brother.

809
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:24,999
But I was wrong.

810
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:29,483
I was wrong.

811
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:49,711
You sleeping?

812
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,735
No. Not much.

813
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:56,176
But I slept last night,
though, you know, and...

814
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,635
Jeez, I...

815
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:01,076
When I woke up, I just...

816
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,934
Somehow I'd forgotten that
all this had happened, you know?

817
00:49:06,394 --> 00:49:09,939
Then, of course,
I remembered, and...

818
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,901
I just wished for a second
somebody else was President.

819
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,882
You mean that?

820
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:19,845
I said, for a second.

821
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:29,542
Boy, there is a lot of noise
out there, Kenny.

822
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:37,258
You know what you're doing,
Mr. President.

823
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:40,594
You're going to make
the best call you can,

824
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,367
and you know they're
going to second-guess you.

825
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,244
So what?

826
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,414
We're just gonna have to
take our beatings as we go.

827
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:56,652
So, what are we
going to do now?

828
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,675
I'm going on TV.

829
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,979
You know, maybe the American
people will go with me.

830
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,212
Even if their...

831
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,965
elected representatives won't.

832
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:27,098
You wear something
nice for the TV.

833
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:28,662
Make sure Jackie picks it.

834
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:36,900
Excuse me.

835
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:41,696
Oh, right. Thanks, Pierre.
Now, I just changed?

836
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,156
OK, everybody,
I think we're ready.

837
00:50:47,326 --> 00:50:49,203
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

838
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:55,042
Mr. President,
in 5, 4, 3, 2...

839
00:50:55,668 --> 00:50:57,858
Good evening,
my fellow citizens.

840
00:50:57,962 --> 00:50:59,943
This Government, as promised,

841
00:51:00,152 --> 00:51:02,133
has maintained
the closest surveillance

842
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,782
<i>of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba.</i>

843
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:07,450
<i>Within the past week,</i>

844
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:10,683
<i>unmistakable evidence
has established the fact</i>

845
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:13,776
<i>that a series
of offensive missile sites</i>

846
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:16,939
<i>is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.</i>

847
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:19,441
<i>The purpose of these bases
can be none other</i>

848
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:22,361
<i>than to provide
a nuclear strike capability</i>

849
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:23,716
<i>against
the Western Hemisphere.</i>

850
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:27,262
<i>Acting therefore in the defense
of our own security</i>

851
00:51:27,366 --> 00:51:30,390
<i>and under the authority entrusted
to me by the Constitution,</i>

852
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:32,788
<i>I have directed
that the following initial steps</i>

853
00:51:32,892 --> 00:51:34,143
<i>be taken immediately.</i>

854
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:37,480
<i>First, to halt
this offensive buildup,</i>

855
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:40,087
<i>a strict quarantine on all
offensive military equipment</i>

856
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:42,276
<i>under shipment to Cuba
is being initiated.</i>

857
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:45,822
<i>All ships of any kind,
bound for Cuba,</i>

858
00:51:45,926 --> 00:51:47,976
<i>from whatever nation or port,</i>

859
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:51,869
<i>will, if found to contain cargos of
offensive weapons, be turned back.</i>

860
00:51:52,078 --> 00:51:54,580
<i>Second, I have directed
the continued and increased</i>

861
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:57,604
<i>close surveillance of Cuba
and its military buildup,</i>

862
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,315
<i>and should these military
preparations continue,</i>

863
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:02,609
<i>further action will be justified.</i>

864
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:06,258
<i>I have directed the Armed Forces
to prepare for any eventualities.</i>

865
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:09,699
<i>And third, it shall be
the policy of this nation</i>

866
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:12,514
<i>to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba</i>

867
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:14,704
<i>against any nation
in the Western Hemisphere</i>

868
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,998
<i>as an attack
by the Soviet Union</i>

869
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:18,771
<i>on the United States</i>

870
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,586
<i>requiring a full
retaliatory response</i>

871
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,837
<i>upon the Soviet Union.</i>

872
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:33,890
Good speech, Teddy.

873
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:37,122
Yeah, well, I guess
I get to keep my job.

874
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,606
No. It was
a really good speech.

875
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:45,463
I can't imagine what you did
with the air strikes version.

876
00:52:50,156 --> 00:52:51,720
I wasn't able
to write it, Kenny.

877
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:57,454
It's kind of hard
to write the unthinkable.

878
00:52:57,767 --> 00:53:00,791
I tried. I just...

879
00:53:03,502 --> 00:53:04,858
I couldn't.

880
00:53:09,237 --> 00:53:11,114
We're getting
the Soviet response.

881
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:13,095
It's coming in on the teletype.

882
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,014
"The community
of nations recognizes

883
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:18,517
the fundamental right
of freedom of the seas... "

884
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:20,081
It's horseshit.

885
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:22,479
I agree.

886
00:53:29,361 --> 00:53:31,655
They don't know how to respond yet.

887
00:53:32,906 --> 00:53:36,764
So now you're Khrushchev.
What do you do?

888
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:43,333
You run the blockade.

889
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:45,314
They'll run the blockade.

890
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:49,381
Which is exactly what they appear
to be preparing to do, Mr. President.

891
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:52,144
We're tracking 26 ships
inbound for Cuba.

892
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:54,768
They show no sign
of changing course.

893
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:57,305
The closest ships,
the Gagarin and the Kimovsk,

894
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:00,120
will make the quarantine line
by this time tomorrow.

895
00:54:00,225 --> 00:54:03,248
Admiral Anderson,
if the ships do not stop,

896
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:05,542
exactly what are
our rules of engagement?

897
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:09,192
Well, Russian-speaking personnel have
been transferred to all our ships.

898
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,381
When the quarantine
takes place in the morning,

899
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:14,926
our ships will attempt to make radio
contact with the approaching vessels.

900
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:18,159
They'll be ordered to reduce speed
and standby for inspection.

901
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:22,017
An inspection team will then
board and search the vessel.

902
00:54:22,121 --> 00:54:25,458
If weapons are found, the ship will
be ordered out of the quarantine area,

903
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,586
or if they refuse, they'll
be towed into the nearest port.

904
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:30,775
What happens if
the ship doesn't stop

905
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,444
for inspection
or want to be towed?

906
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,321
We fire a warning shot
across their bow.

907
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:37,449
And what happens if the ship
ignores the warning shot?

908
00:54:37,553 --> 00:54:41,098
We then fire at its rudder, disable
it, and carry on our inspection.

909
00:54:41,307 --> 00:54:43,600
There will be no shooting
without my explicit orders.

910
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:46,103
Is that understood?

911
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,153
Yes, sir.

912
00:54:48,188 --> 00:54:50,274
Well, Admiral, looks like
it's up to the Navy.

913
00:54:50,378 --> 00:54:52,046
The Navy won't let you down, sir.

914
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,027
There's one other thing,
Mr. President.

915
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:57,468
We're commencing low-level photography
runs over Cuba this morning.

916
00:54:57,677 --> 00:55:00,388
It'll be more detailed
than the U-2 photography.

917
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:03,933
This way, we'll be able to firm up our
estimates of the missiles' readiness

918
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:05,706
and develop target packages
for strikes,

919
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,478
if you should order them, sir.

920
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:10,502
To protect our pilots, we're prepared
to retaliate against any SAM site

921
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,526
or anti-aircraft battery
that may open fire.

922
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,055
We have a flight
of Thunderchiefs

923
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,862
that'll be able to respond
within minutes

924
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:18,739
to any attacks on our planes.

925
00:55:27,081 --> 00:55:29,166
I got a bad feeling about
what's going on in there.

926
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,086
In the morning, I'm taking charge of
the blockade from the Situation Room,

927
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,214
and McNamara is going to set up shop in the flag
plot at the Pentagon and keep an eye on things there.

928
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:36,986
Good, because you'll
get armed boarders

929
00:55:37,195 --> 00:55:38,655
climbing onto Soviet ships,

930
00:55:38,759 --> 00:55:40,531
with shots being fired
across bows?

931
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:42,825
- Well, what about these low-level
flights? - We need the flights.

932
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:45,015
They're starting in what?
An hour.

933
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,413
You realize what you're
letting yourself in for?

934
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:49,916
We need the flights, because the minute
that first missile becomes operational,

935
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,271
we gotta go in there
and destroy it.

936
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,252
Fair enough,
but Castro's on alert,

937
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:55,442
and we're flying attack
planes over their sites

938
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:56,589
on the deck!

939
00:55:57,944 --> 00:55:59,821
There's no way for them to know
we're carrying cameras, not bombs.

940
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:00,968
God damn it!

941
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:03,679
We're going to be shot at,
plain and simple.

942
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:07,433
I'm your political advisor.

943
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:10,248
I'm giving you
a political analysis here.

944
00:56:10,352 --> 00:56:13,481
This... This is a set-up.

945
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,365
The Chiefs want to go in.

946
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,485
They need to redeem themselves
for the Bay of Pigs.

947
00:56:18,694 --> 00:56:20,988
They gotta go in this time.
They got to do it right.

948
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:23,490
I'm going to protect those pilots.

949
00:56:26,514 --> 00:56:28,912
They're boxing us in with
these rules of engagement.

950
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:31,206
If you agree to them and
one of our planes gets knocked down

951
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:33,187
or one of the ships
won't stop for inspection,

952
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:35,169
the Chiefs will have us
by the balls

953
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:38,088
and will force us
to start shooting.

954
00:56:41,842 --> 00:56:43,302
They want a war, Jack,

955
00:56:43,406 --> 00:56:45,804
and they're arranging
things to get one.

956
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:50,392
How does a man get to
a place where he can say,

957
00:56:50,427 --> 00:56:52,894
"Throw those lives away,"
so easily?

958
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,648
Maybe it's harder for them
to say than they let on,

959
00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:59,985
but at the very least, they
believe it's in our best interest.

960
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,174
And you know what?

961
00:57:03,008 --> 00:57:06,554
At the end of the day,
they may well end up being right.

962
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,791
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
we're going to have to triple-check

963
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,355
everything the Chiefs say to us

964
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:18,232
with the guys that
actually have to do it.

965
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:20,838
And nobody's to know about this,
because I—but Bobby.

966
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:23,028
I need redundant control
over what happens out there.

967
00:57:23,132 --> 00:57:25,322
And if things
aren't as advertised,

968
00:57:25,426 --> 00:57:27,512
then you're going to make sure they
come out the way I want them to come out.

969
00:57:27,616 --> 00:57:31,057
- That's gonna be?- Starting
with this low-level flight thing.

970
00:57:31,787 --> 00:57:32,829
That's gonna be tough.

971
00:57:32,934 --> 00:57:35,123
You know how these guys are
about their chains-of-command.

972
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,834
Listen, you tell them
those chains-of-command

973
00:57:37,939 --> 00:57:39,607
end at one place?Me.

974
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:44,403
Go ahead, sir.

975
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:47,114
Speak up, lady. I cannot hear you.
I got a train to catch,

976
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:49,408
and I'd like to be home
by Christmas. Yeah?

977
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:51,494
- That's the one.
- Mr. O'Donnell.

978
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,996
- What's her name?
- Margaret.

979
00:57:54,726 --> 00:57:57,750
- Margaret.
- Give me a break. I'm doing the best that I can.

980
00:57:57,854 --> 00:58:00,252
Yes, sir. I understand exactly
what you're talking about.

981
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:01,920
I speak the language, too.
What?

982
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:05,153
Margaret, would you mind
helping me with something?

983
00:58:05,257 --> 00:58:06,925
What do you need, honey?

984
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:09,636
That tone of voice specifically.

985
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:13,182
What tone of voice? What
the hell is he talking about?

986
00:58:13,286 --> 00:58:15,475
I told you, sir?
I'm sorry. You're outta here.

987
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:22,879
Ready Room.

988
00:58:23,191 --> 00:58:25,173
Hey, Skipper,
what are you doin'?

989
00:58:25,277 --> 00:58:27,049
- Lookin' out the door.
- I'll get him for you.

990
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:29,135
- For what?
- Cuba.

991
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,490
Skipper!

992
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,054
Telephone.

993
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:40,292
<i>- Commander Ecker.
- Commander Ecker?</i>

994
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,420
This is the White House operator.
Please hold for...

995
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:44,567
Shit.

996
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:47,278
Honey, you don't know
what shit is.

997
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:51,657
Commander?
My name's Ken O'Donnell,

998
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,012
Special Assistant
to the President.

999
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,472
Yes, sir.

1000
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:57,600
The President's instructed me
to pass along an order to you.

1001
00:58:57,913 --> 00:58:59,373
You are not to get shot down.

1002
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:02,814
Uh... We'll do our best, sir.

1003
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:04,899
I don't think you
understand me, Commander.

1004
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:08,444
You're not to get shot down
under any circumstances.

1005
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,468
<i>Whatever happens up there,
you were not shot at.</i>

1006
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:13,345
<i>Mechanical failures are fine.</i>

1007
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,326
Crashing into mountains, fine...

1008
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,037
But you and your men
are not to be shot at,

1009
00:59:18,246 --> 00:59:20,748
fired at, or launched upon.

1010
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,563
Excuse me, sir.
What the hell is going on here?

1011
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:25,023
<i>Commander,
if you are fired upon,</i>

1012
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:27,943
The President will be forced to
attack the sites that fire on you.

1013
00:59:28,985 --> 00:59:30,862
<i>He doesn't want
to have to do that.</i>

1014
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:33,677
It's very important that he doesn't,
or things could go

1015
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,346
very badly out of control.

1016
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,014
What about my men?

1017
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:38,647
<i>If we don't have
anybody to protect us,</i>

1018
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:40,872
<i>I'm gonna be writing
letters home to parents.</i>

1019
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:42,436
If the President
protects you, Commander,

1020
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,190
he may have to do it
with the bomb.

1021
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,360
Now, I've know the man
for 15 years. The problem is...

1022
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:52,237
He will protect you.

1023
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,678
So I'm asking,
don't make him protect you.

1024
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:57,138
Don't get shot at.

1025
00:59:58,806 --> 01:00:01,517
OK, Mr. O'Donnell,
we'll do what we can.

1026
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:03,707
I know you will.

1027
01:00:04,645 --> 01:00:06,939
- Good luck, you guys.
- Find your way back!

1028
01:00:10,797 --> 01:00:12,257
Stay close.

1029
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:15,802
Hey, Joey.

1030
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,485
- See ya, Joey.
- Thanks, Joey.

1031
01:00:32,902 --> 01:00:34,571
Ready to go, Jeremy?

1032
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:36,760
- Hey, Bruce.
- Skipper?

1033
01:00:37,282 --> 01:00:39,784
Never mind. Just do what I do.
Hand signs only?

1034
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:41,035
Gotcha.

1035
01:00:52,922 --> 01:00:54,903
You are clear
and ready to go, sir!

1036
01:00:55,007 --> 01:00:56,363
Good luck, Skipper!

1037
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:17,439
Oh-ho, man! Shit!
Did you see it?

1038
01:03:21,193 --> 01:03:22,444
Man, you were lucky, Skipper.

1039
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,468
Damn sparrows.
Must've been migrating.

1040
01:03:25,572 --> 01:03:26,719
Sparrows?

1041
01:03:26,823 --> 01:03:29,534
Probably hit a couple hundred of 'em.
How many did you hit, Bruce?

1042
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,203
Sparrows?

1043
01:03:34,748 --> 01:03:35,790
A few, I guess.

1044
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:38,919
These, uh, 20 millimeter or
40 millimeter sparrows, sir?

1045
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,900
Those are bird strikes.

1046
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:43,089
Sparrows, to be precise.

1047
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,592
It's the way it is, guys.

1048
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,886
Get that film pack done.

1049
01:03:52,682 --> 01:03:53,829
Commander Ecker.

1050
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:54,767
Hello.

1051
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,227
<i>- Sir.
- Commander.</i>

1052
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,417
Mr. O'Donnell, I've been
ordered to deliver the film

1053
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:00,189
to the Pentagon personally.

1054
01:04:00,398 --> 01:04:01,336
What's going on here?

1055
01:04:01,649 --> 01:04:03,735
The Chiefs must
want to talk to you.

1056
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:07,697
They're gonna want to know
if you were fired on. Were you?

1057
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:09,991
<i>You could say that, sir.</i>

1058
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:15,934
Commander, listen to me.

1059
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:17,811
Now, I know this
must fly in the face

1060
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:20,522
of everything
you've come to serve,

1061
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:24,380
but I'm asking you to look
through this to the other side.

1062
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:29,593
Commander William B. Ecker
reporting as ordered.

1063
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:31,644
- Commander.
- Sir.

1064
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:33,660
Put your gear down over here.

1065
01:04:34,703 --> 01:04:36,371
Would you like a glass
of water or anything?

1066
01:04:36,475 --> 01:04:38,039
No, thank you, sir.

1067
01:04:38,978 --> 01:04:40,437
- Sir.
- Commander.

1068
01:04:40,854 --> 01:04:42,106
Have a seat.

1069
01:04:45,338 --> 01:04:47,632
Now, Commander, I assume
you know why you're here.

1070
01:04:47,736 --> 01:04:51,177
Son, I want to know just one thing.

1071
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,305
Those bastards shoot
so much as a BB gun at you?

1072
01:04:57,955 --> 01:04:59,936
It was a cakewalk, sir.

1073
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,438
Mr. President,

1074
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:04,524
the O. A.S. Meeting
starts in less than an hour.

1075
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:06,922
Well, good. I think
we need this one, Dean.

1076
01:05:07,026 --> 01:05:08,799
We can't expect miracles.

1077
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:11,197
Listen, the quarantine
is legal if we get a mandate.

1078
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:14,325
Otherwise, it's an act of war
in the eyes of the world,

1079
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:16,306
so you gotta get me the vote,

1080
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,661
and, you know, make it unanimous.

1081
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:19,538
Mr. President, the Organization
of American States

1082
01:05:19,643 --> 01:05:20,894
hasn't had a unanimous vote?

1083
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:22,979
Unanimous... Dean.

1084
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:52,279
In accordance with
this afternoon's vote

1085
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,885
at the Organization
of American States,

1086
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,388
the quarantine
will hereby be effective

1087
01:05:57,423 --> 01:05:59,682
as of 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1088
01:06:16,261 --> 01:06:17,373
<i>At 8 a. m. This morning,</i>

1089
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:19,702
<i>the United States
detonated a hydrogen bomb</i>

1090
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:22,725
<i>above Johnston Island
in the South Pacific.</i>

1091
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:25,749
<i>The blast was quickly condemned
by the Soviet Union,</i>

1092
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:28,669
<i>who called upon all nations
to denounce the United States</i>

1093
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:30,754
<i>for bringing the world
to the brink of destruction.</i>

1094
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:32,840
Who the hell
authorized this test?

1095
01:06:32,944 --> 01:06:34,299
Christ, what is this gonna
say to the Russians?

1096
01:06:34,404 --> 01:06:36,072
They look warlike?

1097
01:06:36,176 --> 01:06:38,262
Jesus Christ. We're
lighting off nuclear weapons

1098
01:06:38,366 --> 01:06:40,138
like it's our own private
Fourth of July.

1099
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:41,390
You know what we should have done?

1100
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:44,309
We should've brought in the guys
from the Atomic Energy Commission

1101
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:46,707
and talked this through,
you know?

1102
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:49,523
Looked at these tests
a little harder before

1103
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:51,608
just givin' the go-ahead.

1104
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:57,447
You know, last summer I read
a book, "The Guns of August".

1105
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:01,305
I wish every man on that
blockade line had read that book.

1106
01:07:01,514 --> 01:07:03,807
It's World War I,
13 million killed.

1107
01:07:03,912 --> 01:07:06,206
It was all because
the militaries of both alliances

1108
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:07,874
believed they were
so highly attuned

1109
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:10,064
to one another's movements
and dispositions,

1110
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:12,358
they could predict
one another's intentions,

1111
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,130
but all their theories
were based on the last war,

1112
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,737
and the world
and technology had changed,

1113
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:19,135
and those lessons
were no longer valid,

1114
01:07:19,344 --> 01:07:22,159
but it was all they knew,
so the orders went out.

1115
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:24,766
Couldn't be rescinded.

1116
01:07:27,894 --> 01:07:29,353
The man in the field,
his family at home,

1117
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:32,482
they couldn't even tell you the reasons
why their lives were being destroyed.

1118
01:07:35,922 --> 01:07:37,904
But why couldn't they stop it?

1119
01:07:38,842 --> 01:07:40,719
What could they have done?

1120
01:07:41,344 --> 01:07:43,430
Here we are 50 years later.

1121
01:07:44,472 --> 01:07:47,288
If one of their ships
resists the inspection

1122
01:07:47,913 --> 01:07:51,146
and we shoot out
its rudder and board,

1123
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:54,795
they shoot down one
of our planes in response,

1124
01:07:55,525 --> 01:07:58,862
so we bomb their anti-aircraft sites.
In response to that...

1125
01:07:59,904 --> 01:08:01,885
They attack Berlin.

1126
01:08:04,075 --> 01:08:05,848
So we invade Cuba.

1127
01:08:08,871 --> 01:08:11,270
Then they fire their missiles.

1128
01:08:15,232 --> 01:08:17,109
And we fire ours.

1129
01:08:24,095 --> 01:08:27,119
Helen, I want you to keep
the kids close tomorrow.

1130
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:30,455
I want you to leave the TV on.

1131
01:08:30,559 --> 01:08:32,019
I want you to sleep
with it on in the bedroom

1132
01:08:32,124 --> 01:08:36,086
until I call you and tell you
you can turn it off.

1133
01:08:36,294 --> 01:08:37,754
<i>What's happened?</i>

1134
01:08:38,588 --> 01:08:41,403
Nothing. Nothing you don't
already know about.

1135
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:45,574
Just have the car
ready to go in case I call...

1136
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:48,181
or the Civil Defense Warning
comes on.

1137
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:50,996
<i>What happens to you?</i>

1138
01:08:51,935 --> 01:08:54,124
I'm not leaving without you.

1139
01:08:55,688 --> 01:08:58,191
I'll be evacuated
with the President.

1140
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:02,987
Great.

1141
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:05,490
Great.

1142
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:08,931
And while you're under a rock
somewhere with the President,

1143
01:09:09,556 --> 01:09:12,267
what am I supposed to do
with our 5 children, Kenny?

1144
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:15,082
Honey, we're not gonna
let it come to that.

1145
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:16,646
I promise.

1146
01:09:17,898 --> 01:09:19,879
<i>Jack and Bobby, they're...</i>

1147
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:22,903
They're smart guys.

1148
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,012
You're smart, too.

1149
01:09:32,183 --> 01:09:34,059
Not like them.

1150
01:09:40,628 --> 01:09:41,984
Well, hi, Ken.

1151
01:09:47,927 --> 01:09:49,596
Helen just asked me
what sort of arrangements

1152
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,577
we have for the families.

1153
01:09:51,994 --> 01:09:54,288
Yeah, I just checked that myself.

1154
01:09:54,496 --> 01:09:56,790
They're being issued
identity cards,

1155
01:09:56,894 --> 01:09:59,084
and the call comes,
evacuation officers

1156
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:01,795
meet them at
pre-arranged departure areas.

1157
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:03,672
They go by helicopter
to Mount Weather.

1158
01:10:04,089 --> 01:10:05,757
We meet them there.

1159
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:12,118
Of course, that's for morale.

1160
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,976
Missiles only take
5 minutes to get here.

1161
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:23,483
The President has asked Jackie and the
children to come back from the country

1162
01:10:23,518 --> 01:10:25,047
and be with him.

1163
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:29,114
You know those pictures
upstairs?

1164
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:31,199
Pictures of Lincoln?

1165
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:35,578
He looked so old near the end.

1166
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:38,706
When we got here,
I said,

1167
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:41,000
"It's not gonna
happen to us. "

1168
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:43,711
We were too young.

1169
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,944
Why don't you go home tonight?

1170
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:50,176
Go on home.

1171
01:10:51,323 --> 01:10:54,451
No. It's too much trouble
to get the car.

1172
01:10:54,868 --> 01:10:57,162
Ken, we can get your car
in 15 minutes.

1173
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,769
- No.
- Go ahead.

1174
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:01,646
No.

1175
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:03,731
I'll let her sleep.

1176
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:07,485
I'll let 'em sleep.

1177
01:11:08,423 --> 01:11:11,760
<i>It almost seemed today
as if time stood still.</i>

1178
01:11:11,864 --> 01:11:13,636
<i>The shooting
hadn't started yet,</i>

1179
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,826
<i>but there weren't any
really encouraging signs</i>

1180
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:17,077
<i>that it could be avoided,</i>

1181
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:21,457
<i>but worried, alarmed,
afraid, perhaps even,</i>

1182
01:11:21,665 --> 01:11:23,438
<i>the American public,
nonetheless,</i>

1183
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,836
<i>appeared determined and resolved.</i>

1184
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:28,547
<i>This is Walter Cronkite.</i>

1185
01:11:29,068 --> 01:11:30,424
<i>Good night.</i>

1186
01:12:11,402 --> 01:12:12,549
Paper?

1187
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,615
- Yeah, thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

1188
01:13:16,466 --> 01:13:18,342
Gentlemen, can you hear me?

1189
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:20,324
Yes, we can hear you fine.

1190
01:13:20,532 --> 01:13:22,826
I've got one minute
till 10:00 here.

1191
01:13:23,347 --> 01:13:25,954
<i>The quarantine commences
in one minute.</i>

1192
01:13:32,315 --> 01:13:33,670
And no sign of them stopping.

1193
01:13:50,249 --> 01:13:51,500
Sir.

1194
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:01,510
Quarantine is now in effect.

1195
01:14:02,031 --> 01:14:03,908
And it looks like
our first customers

1196
01:14:04,012 --> 01:14:06,411
are the Gagarin and Kimovsk.

1197
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:28,724
Chief, I've got something
at zero-three-zero.

1198
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,478
X.O., take a look at this.

1199
01:14:35,919 --> 01:14:37,691
New contact, Skipper.

1200
01:14:44,782 --> 01:14:46,085
What do we got?

1201
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,388
A Russian sub.

1202
01:14:50,412 --> 01:14:51,768
General Quarters,
General Quarters!

1203
01:14:51,872 --> 01:14:53,853
All hands
man your battle stations!

1204
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:55,104
<i>General Quarters,
General Quarters!</i>

1205
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:56,668
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations!</i>

1206
01:14:56,773 --> 01:14:57,920
<i>General Quarters,
General Quarters!</i>

1207
01:14:58,128 --> 01:15:00,631
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations!</i>

1208
01:15:04,384 --> 01:15:07,512
Bracket 231 correlates to
our submarine at 9,000 yards.

1209
01:15:12,726 --> 01:15:14,915
It's protecting the freighters.

1210
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,342
Bob, is there any way

1211
01:15:25,551 --> 01:15:27,845
we can avoid stopping
a submarine first?

1212
01:15:27,949 --> 01:15:29,791
I'm afraid not, Mr. President.

1213
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:32,537
The sub has positioned itself between
the Pierce and the Soviet ships.

1214
01:15:33,163 --> 01:15:35,039
<i>Admiral Anderson insists
it's too much of a risk</i>

1215
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:36,603
<i>to proceed with stopping
the freighters.</i>

1216
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:39,314
<i>The Pierce would be
a sitting duck for the sub.</i>

1217
01:15:40,774 --> 01:15:42,651
<i>- Put me through to the Pierce.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1218
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,389
Admiral Anderson!

1219
01:15:44,424 --> 01:15:47,135
The President wishes to speak
directly to the Captain of the Pierce.

1220
01:15:48,386 --> 01:15:49,637
Is that a problem?

1221
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,514
No, it isn't, sir.

1222
01:15:52,557 --> 01:15:53,808
He's putting you through, sir.

1223
01:15:54,225 --> 01:15:56,519
<i>Sir, I'm patching you
through to the bridge now.</i>

1224
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,647
This is the Captain
of the Pierce.

1225
01:16:00,273 --> 01:16:01,524
Captain, this is
the President speaking.

1226
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:03,713
Mr. President.

1227
01:16:03,818 --> 01:16:04,756
<i>Is there any way</i>

1228
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,093
you can force that sub to the surface
without damaging it or yourself?

1229
01:16:08,405 --> 01:16:10,282
I can bring it up, Mr. President,

1230
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:13,202
but whether it's damaged
or not is up to the sub.

1231
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:15,287
Even if they do force it up,

1232
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:18,207
that sub will be inspected
over the crew's dead bodies.

1233
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:21,126
They'd be executed for
allowing it when they got home.

1234
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:35,307
Captain, force the sub
to the surface.

1235
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:36,558
<i>Yes, Mr. President.</i>

1236
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:41,250
- Prepare to fire torpedoes.
- Prepare to fire torpedoes. Aye, sir.

1237
01:16:41,355 --> 01:16:43,753
- Prepare to launch ASROC.
- Prepare to launch ASROC. Aye, sir.

1238
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:54,284
Watch your fingers!

1239
01:16:54,388 --> 01:16:55,639
Watch your fingers.

1240
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:15,138
What are they up to?

1241
01:17:17,536 --> 01:17:19,100
They're slowing down.

1242
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,214
Mr. Secretary,

1243
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,385
I'm receiving reports. The Russian
ships appear to be stopping.

1244
01:17:33,489 --> 01:17:34,323
Mr. President,

1245
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:36,617
<i>Reports are coming
in here to the Pentagon</i>

1246
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:38,703
<i>that the ships
appear to be stopping.</i>

1247
01:17:38,807 --> 01:17:40,788
Captain, belay that order.
Belay that order!

1248
01:17:40,892 --> 01:17:41,622
Hold your fire!

1249
01:17:41,831 --> 01:17:43,916
- Bob, where's that coming from?
- One second, Mr. President.

1250
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,836
Somebody find out
what's going on.

1251
01:17:49,651 --> 01:17:51,841
Those ships
are definitely stopping.

1252
01:17:53,926 --> 01:17:55,073
Some are turning around.

1253
01:17:58,097 --> 01:17:59,139
Are they stopping?

1254
01:17:59,244 --> 01:18:00,182
I don't know what
the hell they're doing.

1255
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:03,206
Admiral. Admiral,
what's happening!

1256
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,604
Yes, sir, they are stopping.

1257
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:08,280
Mr. President,

1258
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:10,296
reports are coming in
from all around.

1259
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,590
The ships are stopping.

1260
01:18:13,216 --> 01:18:14,988
Some are turning around.

1261
01:18:15,197 --> 01:18:17,595
Some are turning around.

1262
01:18:27,292 --> 01:18:28,439
We were eyeball to eyeball,

1263
01:18:28,543 --> 01:18:30,107
and I think
the other fella just blinked.

1264
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:48,876
Yes, sir.

1265
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:50,231
Yes, sir.
We have that information.

1266
01:18:50,336 --> 01:18:53,151
Mr. President.
Mr. President, sir.

1267
01:18:53,464 --> 01:18:55,653
We have the tally from NSA.

1268
01:18:55,758 --> 01:18:58,469
We have 20 ships stopping
and /or turning around.

1269
01:18:58,573 --> 01:19:01,075
6, however, appear to be
continuing for the line.

1270
01:19:05,038 --> 01:19:07,540
It's a, uh, it's a mistake.

1271
01:19:07,749 --> 01:19:10,772
They must not have gotten
their orders yet. I'd-let 'em go.

1272
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:12,649
No. That's unlikely, Bobby.

1273
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,213
We've been monitoring
the radio transmissions

1274
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:16,611
from the Gagarin and the Kimovsk.

1275
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:19,114
Their radios are working
just fine, Mr. President.

1276
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:22,346
One ship, an accident maybe.

1277
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:24,953
6, Mr. President?
This is intentional.

1278
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,308
<i>Mr. President, let 'em go.</i>

1279
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:27,560
Oh, you're still here, Bob?

1280
01:19:27,664 --> 01:19:29,541
<i>4 of the 6 continuing ships</i>

1281
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,209
<i>are still a day
away from the line.</i>

1282
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:34,198
They've stopped the ones
we suspect have weapons aboard.

1283
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:37,048
We'd look pretty bad shooting up
a freighter full of baby food.

1284
01:19:37,361 --> 01:19:39,134
We sure as shit would.

1285
01:19:41,115 --> 01:19:44,034
Captain, I want you to maintain
contact with those ships

1286
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:46,954
and do nothing until I order
otherwise. Is that clear?

1287
01:19:47,058 --> 01:19:48,413
Yes, Mr. President.

1288
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:49,978
Contact only.

1289
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:59,049
<i>At its beginning,
this day looked</i>

1290
01:19:59,153 --> 01:20:01,864
<i>as though it might be
one of armed conflict</i>

1291
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:04,888
<i>between Soviet vessels
and American warships</i>

1292
01:20:04,992 --> 01:20:07,286
<i>on the sea lanes leading to Cuba.</i>

1293
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:09,893
Find out how close
our exercises are coming

1294
01:20:09,997 --> 01:20:11,978
to their anti-ship missiles.

1295
01:20:37,107 --> 01:20:37,941
God damn it!

1296
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:39,679
How the goddamn hell
did this happen?

1297
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:42,216
I'm gonna have Powers' head
on a platter...

1298
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:43,885
Next to LeMay's.

1299
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:47,013
Kenny, you hear me give the order
to go to DEFCON 2?

1300
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,411
Because I remember giving the order
to go to DEFCON 3,

1301
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:51,913
but I must be
suffering from amnesia.

1302
01:20:52,852 --> 01:20:56,084
I've just been informed
our nuclear forces are at DEFCON 2.

1303
01:20:56,397 --> 01:20:57,822
They were limited, Mr. President.

1304
01:20:57,857 --> 01:21:00,359
- The orders were limited to our strategic forces...
- Max!

1305
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:02,653
...in the continental United States.

1306
01:21:02,862 --> 01:21:04,286
General LeMay is correct.

1307
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:06,824
Technically, SAC has
the statutory authority?

1308
01:21:07,032 --> 01:21:08,701
I have the authority!

1309
01:21:09,326 --> 01:21:11,203
I am the Commander in Chief
of the United States,

1310
01:21:11,308 --> 01:21:14,123
and I say when we go to war.

1311
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:18,189
We're not at war, sir?
Not until DEFCON one.

1312
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:26,183
General, the Joint Chiefs

1313
01:21:26,218 --> 01:21:29,346
have just signaled our intent
to escalate to the Soviets.

1314
01:21:29,867 --> 01:21:32,370
You signaled an escalation
which I had no wish to signal,

1315
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:33,725
and which I did not approve.

1316
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:37,896
Just get out of here, Max.

1317
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,356
Yes, sir.

1318
01:21:47,906 --> 01:21:49,991
Rescind the order.
Can all the Chiefs.

1319
01:21:50,096 --> 01:21:52,077
Put Nitze, Gilpatrick and
the Under Secretaries in charge.

1320
01:21:52,181 --> 01:21:53,537
- Can't do that, Bobby.
- Yes, we can.

1321
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:55,413
We can't fire the Chiefs, Bobby.

1322
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,603
Our invasion talk
would look like a bluff.

1323
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,940
Or even worse, that
there's been an attempted coup.

1324
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:06,049
Jesus.

1325
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:15,225
Kenny, give me...

1326
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:16,789
a couple minutes
alone with Bobby, would you?

1327
01:22:28,467 --> 01:22:31,282
Just—Just try this on
for size.

1328
01:22:31,699 --> 01:22:33,263
We get a hold
of Walter Lippmann,

1329
01:22:33,889 --> 01:22:35,766
And we leak the idea of

1330
01:22:35,974 --> 01:22:38,059
pulling our Jupiter missiles
out of Turkey,

1331
01:22:38,164 --> 01:22:40,875
and the Soviets pull
their missiles out of Cuba.

1332
01:22:42,543 --> 01:22:43,794
Act through the U.N.!

1333
01:22:44,003 --> 01:22:45,358
K and K must talk!

1334
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,339
End the arms race,
not the human race!

1335
01:22:58,183 --> 01:22:59,069
Kenny.

1336
01:22:59,104 --> 01:22:59,956
Mac.

1337
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,041
What did you think of
the Lippmann column this morning?

1338
01:23:02,146 --> 01:23:03,293
I think it's a bad idea.

1339
01:23:03,397 --> 01:23:05,169
Thank God. Look,
everybody's furious about it.

1340
01:23:05,274 --> 01:23:07,776
We trade away our missiles in Turkey,
and we're dead, politically.

1341
01:23:07,811 --> 01:23:08,819
You've got to stop it.

1342
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:11,321
We know it was Jack and Bobby's idea.
They leaked it to Lippmann.

1343
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:13,198
The military guys
are going ape?

1344
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:14,137
Then they should speak up.

1345
01:23:14,345 --> 01:23:16,326
Christ, Ken,
it's not that easy.

1346
01:23:16,431 --> 01:23:17,473
- It is.
- No, it isn't.

1347
01:23:17,578 --> 01:23:18,794
They don't trust the people
who feel this way,

1348
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:20,914
but these people are right,
and the Kennedys are wrong.

1349
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:22,270
We need you to talk to them.

1350
01:23:22,374 --> 01:23:23,417
They'll listen to you.

1351
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,398
Jack and Bobby are good men,
but it takes a certain?

1352
01:23:25,502 --> 01:23:27,692
You mean the President
of the United States?

1353
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:28,630
And the Attorney General?

1354
01:23:28,734 --> 01:23:30,507
Kenny, they are good men,
but it takes a certain character,

1355
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:32,279
moral toughness,
to stand up to the Soviets.

1356
01:23:32,384 --> 01:23:33,739
You listen to me.

1357
01:23:34,156 --> 01:23:37,076
You're in the White House
right now because of the Kennedys.

1358
01:23:37,284 --> 01:23:40,100
Now, they may be wrong,
they make mistakes,

1359
01:23:40,204 --> 01:23:42,185
but they are not weak.

1360
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:44,687
The weak ones are these people who
can't seem to speak their own minds.

1361
01:23:44,792 --> 01:23:45,834
You know I don't mean
that they're weak.

1362
01:23:46,043 --> 01:23:47,816
No, they just lack
a moral toughness.

1363
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:50,527
Jesus Christ, Mac.

1364
01:23:51,986 --> 01:23:55,323
You—You think I'll
play your Judas for you?

1365
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:57,304
You've never understood us,
your kind.

1366
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:59,911
We've been fighting
with each other our whole lives,

1367
01:23:59,946 --> 01:24:01,371
but nobody plays us
off each other,

1368
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:04,707
and nobody ever, ever
gets between us!

1369
01:24:06,063 --> 01:24:08,148
It's a goddamn
trial balloon, Kenny.

1370
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:10,755
Well, then somebody
better publicly deny it,

1371
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:13,466
'cause there's only one way
the world's gonna read this.

1372
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:16,594
We sell out one of our friends
for our own safety.

1373
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:21,077
Exactly.

1374
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,727
Jesus Christ,
they're just killing us.

1375
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:28,481
<i>...and enter into negotiations</i>

1376
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,400
<i>in order to normalize
this confrontation</i>

1377
01:24:31,504 --> 01:24:33,694
<i>and avert the threat
of a World War.</i>

1378
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:35,988
What is it
that Sun Tzu says?

1379
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:41,410
War's a moral contest, and they're won
in the temples before they're ever fought.

1380
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,121
<i>...this enormous danger
for all mankind</i>

1381
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,605
<i>which exist at this moment...</i>

1382
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:51,420
It's right here. It's right here.
This is where we turn it around.

1383
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:52,567
You call Adlai,

1384
01:24:52,775 --> 01:24:54,339
you tell him to stick it
to this son of a bitch.

1385
01:24:54,444 --> 01:24:57,780
<i>...diplomatic resolution.</i>

1386
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,577
<i>The U.S. Believes that
with their economic boycott,</i>

1387
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,766
<i>by pressuring other countries</i>

1388
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:06,852
<i>to cease trade with Cuba,</i>

1389
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:09,875
<i>we would surrender
due to hunger.</i>

1390
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,169
<i>How does it feel,
Mr. President,</i>

1391
01:25:12,795 --> 01:25:15,089
<i>to be this heroic</i>

1392
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:18,113
<i>and force a country
to surrender...</i>

1393
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:19,364
Am I still on hold here?

1394
01:25:19,677 --> 01:25:20,824
They're trying
to find him right now.

1395
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,952
Ken, Adlai's too weak.

1396
01:25:24,056 --> 01:25:26,350
We have to convince Jack to
pull him. Get McCloy in there.

1397
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,227
You can't take him out
this late in the game, Bobby.

1398
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:30,416
Zorin will eat him alive.

1399
01:25:30,729 --> 01:25:32,398
Then talk to your brother,
god damn it.

1400
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:35,734
The two of you don't need
my advice to get into trouble.

1401
01:25:35,838 --> 01:25:37,507
What's gotten into you?

1402
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:43,659
Are you still sore about
this Lippmann thing?

1403
01:25:43,763 --> 01:25:45,535
That's something your father
would have done right there.

1404
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:52,209
My father?

1405
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:55,545
I'm just trying to make a point.

1406
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,152
This idea is that fucking bad.

1407
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,095
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows
the inning, he knows the score.

1408
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,034
He better,

1409
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:08,475
because nobody believes
he's up to this?

1410
01:26:08,892 --> 01:26:09,830
Nobody.

1411
01:26:12,437 --> 01:26:13,480
<i>Yes?</i>

1412
01:26:13,584 --> 01:26:14,592
<i>- Adlai?
- Yes.</i>

1413
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:16,399
It's Ken. How you doing?

1414
01:26:16,503 --> 01:26:18,902
I'm busy, Ken.
What do you need?

1415
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:21,091
The President told me
to pass a word to you.

1416
01:26:21,196 --> 01:26:22,134
Stick it to them.

1417
01:26:22,447 --> 01:26:24,532
<i>Cuba together...</i>

1418
01:26:24,636 --> 01:26:27,973
I hear you.
I'm glad it's you calling.

1419
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:29,850
L—I thought
it would be Bobby.

1420
01:26:30,163 --> 01:26:32,769
Adlai, the world has
to know we're right.

1421
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,272
If we're gonna have a chance
at a political solution,

1422
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,357
we need international pressure.

1423
01:26:38,817 --> 01:26:40,694
You got to be tough, Adlai.

1424
01:26:41,528 --> 01:26:42,779
You need to find it, Buddy.

1425
01:26:43,822 --> 01:26:45,386
<i>Well, if they're still sticking</i>

1426
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:47,263
to their stonewalling strategy,

1427
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:48,827
I'll get them.

1428
01:26:49,244 --> 01:26:50,912
I'm an old political cat,
Kenny...

1429
01:26:52,164 --> 01:26:54,249
<i>But I've got one life left.</i>

1430
01:26:54,353 --> 01:26:55,396
I know you do.

1431
01:26:56,126 --> 01:26:57,273
See you, Ken.

1432
01:26:57,377 --> 01:27:01,235
<i>We'll be able to find together
a proper...</i>

1433
01:27:01,339 --> 01:27:02,799
Bobby.

1434
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:17,292
We call upon the world

1435
01:27:17,397 --> 01:27:20,629
to condemn this purely
American provocation.

1436
01:27:21,984 --> 01:27:24,904
We, the people of Romania,

1437
01:27:25,113 --> 01:27:27,198
are standing in solidarity

1438
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:31,682
with the people of the Republic
of Cuba and the revolution

1439
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:35,644
in the face of this
American threat to world peace.

1440
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:38,250
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1441
01:27:45,237 --> 01:27:48,990
We're very glad that you could
join us, Mr. Stevenson.

1442
01:27:52,848 --> 01:27:54,273
For the last 2 hours,

1443
01:27:54,308 --> 01:27:59,000
the entire world here
is asking only questions.

1444
01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:04,631
The United States
is pushing the entire world

1445
01:28:04,735 --> 01:28:07,237
to the brink of catastrophe.

1446
01:28:09,844 --> 01:28:12,972
The people of the whole world
want to know why.

1447
01:28:16,622 --> 01:28:19,124
<i>We are told again and again</i>

1448
01:28:19,228 --> 01:28:21,835
<i>about some
incontrovertible evidence</i>

1449
01:28:21,939 --> 01:28:25,589
<i>of offensive weapons in Cuba...</i>

1450
01:28:27,361 --> 01:28:32,783
<i>But no evidence
can be shown to us.</i>

1451
01:28:36,746 --> 01:28:39,978
Perhaps your spy planes
are so secret

1452
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:42,689
that you are simply incapable

1453
01:28:42,793 --> 01:28:46,755
<i>to present such evidence.
Some planes.</i>

1454
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,362
I make the call,
Adlai is out. McCloy goes in.

1455
01:28:49,466 --> 01:28:50,613
Let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

1456
01:28:50,822 --> 01:28:53,533
<i>...simply don't have
such evidence.</i>

1457
01:29:00,206 --> 01:29:04,168
Perhaps the United States
of America is simply mistaken.

1458
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:11,467
<i>Yes, the United States
of America</i>

1459
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:15,221
<i>does not have any facts in hands,
only falsifications.</i>

1460
01:29:17,098 --> 01:29:18,557
John, get ready to send
your staffer in.

1461
01:29:18,662 --> 01:29:20,017
He's gonna be coming out.

1462
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:27,108
The Chair recognizes the representative
from the United States of America.

1463
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,634
Well, let me say something
to you, Mr. Ambassador.

1464
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,032
We do have the evidence.

1465
01:29:35,241 --> 01:29:39,098
<i>We do have it, and it is clear
and incontrovertible.</i>

1466
01:29:39,203 --> 01:29:41,497
<i>And let me say something else.</i>

1467
01:29:41,705 --> 01:29:44,729
<i>Those weapons
must be taken out of Cuba.</i>

1468
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,919
<i>You, the Soviet Union,
have created this new danger...</i>

1469
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:48,066
Come on, Adlai.

1470
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:50,047
<i>Not the United States.</i>

1471
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:53,279
<i>Mr. Zorin, I remind you
that the other day</i>

1472
01:29:53,383 --> 01:29:56,094
you did not deny
the existence of these weapons,

1473
01:29:56,199 --> 01:29:59,744
but today, again,
if I have heard you correctly,

1474
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:02,976
you now say they do not exist.

1475
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:11,735
<i>All right, sir, let me
ask you one simple question.</i>

1476
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,924
Come on, Adlai,
don't let him off.

1477
01:30:14,759 --> 01:30:16,288
<i>Do you, Ambassador Zorin,</i>

1478
01:30:16,323 --> 01:30:19,763
deny that the USSR
has placed and is placing

1479
01:30:19,868 --> 01:30:23,934
medium and intermediate-range
missiles in sites in Cuba?

1480
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:25,081
Yes or no?

1481
01:30:25,185 --> 01:30:26,645
<i>Don't wait for the translation.</i>

1482
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:28,001
<i>Yes or no?</i>

1483
01:30:28,209 --> 01:30:29,356
Yeah.

1484
01:30:36,759 --> 01:30:39,679
I am not
in the American courtroom,

1485
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:44,475
and I do not wish to respond
to questions...

1486
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:51,253
questions that a prosecutor
would put to the defendant.

1487
01:30:51,357 --> 01:30:52,295
You will get...

1488
01:30:53,234 --> 01:30:55,319
all the answers
to your questions

1489
01:30:55,424 --> 01:30:57,578
as this session progresses.

1490
01:30:57,613 --> 01:31:00,324
You are in a courtroom
of world opinion right now,

1491
01:31:00,428 --> 01:31:02,618
and you can answer yes or no.

1492
01:31:02,722 --> 01:31:07,206
<i>You have denied they exist, and I want to
know if I have understood you correctly.</i>

1493
01:31:10,438 --> 01:31:13,358
<i>Continue?
Continue your statement.</i>

1494
01:31:13,462 --> 01:31:15,547
You will get your answers
in due course.

1495
01:31:15,756 --> 01:31:18,050
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1496
01:31:21,804 --> 01:31:25,245
<i>I'm prepared to wait for my answer
until Hell freezes over,</i>

1497
01:31:25,349 --> 01:31:27,121
<i>if that's what is needed.</i>

1498
01:31:31,188 --> 01:31:32,335
John, I'll get back to you.

1499
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:35,046
<i>I'm also prepared to present
the evidence in this room</i>

1500
01:31:35,463 --> 01:31:37,027
<i>proving that the Soviet Union</i>

1501
01:31:37,235 --> 01:31:38,904
<i>has lied to the world.</i>

1502
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:49,122
If you have decided not
to continue your statement,

1503
01:31:49,226 --> 01:31:53,501
the Chair recognizes
the representative from Chile.

1504
01:31:53,536 --> 01:31:55,274
I yield my time on the floor

1505
01:31:55,378 --> 01:31:57,359
to the representative
of the United States.

1506
01:31:59,132 --> 01:32:01,322
Well, then,
ladies and gentlemen,

1507
01:32:01,426 --> 01:32:03,928
since it appears we're going
to be here for a while,

1508
01:32:04,554 --> 01:32:08,099
<i>shall we have a look at what
the Soviets are doing in Cuba?</i>

1509
01:32:08,725 --> 01:32:11,019
May we have
the presentation, please?

1510
01:32:11,644 --> 01:32:14,564
Ladies and gentlemen, if you
will observe in photograph "a"...

1511
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:16,649
Yeah. Yeah.

1512
01:32:18,318 --> 01:32:20,194
<i>...taken approximately
August 29...</i>

1513
01:32:20,299 --> 01:32:21,863
Old Adlai had it
in him after all.

1514
01:32:21,967 --> 01:32:24,157
Zorin must not have
gotten instructions.

1515
01:32:24,261 --> 01:32:26,242
Somebody in their Foreign Ministry
is blowing it big time.

1516
01:32:26,346 --> 01:32:29,891
<i>In photograph "b", we have October
14th. The photograph taken then...</i>

1517
01:32:29,996 --> 01:32:30,830
Mr. President.

1518
01:32:30,934 --> 01:32:32,707
<i>There are at least 3 missile sites
being constructed.</i>

1519
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,062
<i>There are bunkers...</i>

1520
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:36,148
The ship is called the Grozny.

1521
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,797
We lost track of it
yesterday at nightfall.

1522
01:32:40,944 --> 01:32:44,281
We thought we gave it plenty of room
when we moved the quarantine line back.

1523
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,992
We just reacquired it.

1524
01:32:47,513 --> 01:32:48,868
It crossed the line
hours ago.

1525
01:32:48,973 --> 01:32:51,371
<i>Well, how the hell do you
lose a goddamn tanker?</i>

1526
01:32:51,475 --> 01:32:53,248
<i>What the hell's going on
over there?</i>

1527
01:33:05,134 --> 01:33:06,698
Hail 'em again.

1528
01:33:08,471 --> 01:33:10,661
I want you to try 'em again.

1529
01:33:19,524 --> 01:33:20,671
We are kidding ourselves.

1530
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:22,756
New coordinates for the Pierce.

1531
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,718
Pierce coordinates,
25 degrees, 30 minutes north,

1532
01:33:26,822 --> 01:33:29,012
78 degrees, 10 minutes west.

1533
01:33:49,345 --> 01:33:50,492
Not responding, Chief.

1534
01:33:50,596 --> 01:33:51,847
Tell the Skipper.

1535
01:33:52,785 --> 01:33:53,828
They're not responding, sir.

1536
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:55,705
<i>General Quarters,
General Quarters!</i>

1537
01:33:55,914 --> 01:33:57,582
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations.</i>

1538
01:33:57,686 --> 01:34:00,189
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations.</i>

1539
01:34:11,137 --> 01:34:13,118
Very well. Load your guns.

1540
01:34:13,222 --> 01:34:14,369
Guns are loaded, sir.

1541
01:34:15,725 --> 01:34:16,872
What was that, Admiral?

1542
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:20,000
We've been hailing the Grozny
for the last hour, Mr. Secretary.

1543
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:22,398
The Grozny refuses to stop.

1544
01:34:22,606 --> 01:34:23,336
What are you doing?

1545
01:34:24,796 --> 01:34:26,673
Carrying out our mission,
Mr. Secretary.

1546
01:34:26,777 --> 01:34:28,445
Now, if you don't mind,
we're very busy right now.

1547
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:30,844
We need to be able
to do our jobs.

1548
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:33,138
Admiral, I asked you a question.

1549
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:36,683
We're going to follow
the rules of engagement?

1550
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:40,124
The rules of engagement which the
President has approved and signed

1551
01:34:40,228 --> 01:34:42,939
in his order of 23 October.

1552
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:45,233
Yes.

1553
01:34:46,276 --> 01:34:47,944
Yes, you may proceed,
Captain.

1554
01:34:48,257 --> 01:34:50,133
- Clear your guns.
- What?

1555
01:34:53,366 --> 01:34:54,304
Damn it!

1556
01:34:54,513 --> 01:34:55,660
- Stop that firing!
- What?

1557
01:34:55,764 --> 01:34:57,537
Stop that firing!

1558
01:34:57,954 --> 01:34:59,726
Cease fire. Cease fire!

1559
01:34:59,831 --> 01:35:00,873
God help us.

1560
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:06,452
- The ship was firing star shells.
- What?

1561
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,954
Star shells! Flares,
Mr. Secretary.

1562
01:35:09,163 --> 01:35:11,422
God damn it! I've got
a job to do here.

1563
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:14,011
Now, you've been camped out
out there since Monday night.

1564
01:35:14,046 --> 01:35:16,566
You're tired, you're exhausted,
and you're making mistakes.

1565
01:35:16,774 --> 01:35:19,381
You interfere with me and
you will get some of my men killed,

1566
01:35:19,485 --> 01:35:21,779
and I will not allow that!

1567
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,760
Star shells.

1568
01:35:23,969 --> 01:35:26,367
Get out of our way,
Mr. Secretary.

1569
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,827
The Navy's been
running blockades

1570
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:29,912
since the days
of John Paul Jones.

1571
01:35:30,121 --> 01:35:31,476
I believe the President
made it clear

1572
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:34,917
that there will be no firing on ships
without his express permission.

1573
01:35:35,126 --> 01:35:37,732
With all due respect,
Mr. Secretary,

1574
01:35:37,837 --> 01:35:39,713
we were not firing on that ship.

1575
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:40,965
What the hell was that?

1576
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:43,363
Firing on a ship
means attacking a ship.

1577
01:35:43,398 --> 01:35:45,448
We were not attacking
that ship.

1578
01:35:45,483 --> 01:35:47,429
We were firing over it.

1579
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:50,662
That was not the President's
intention when he gave that order.

1580
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,372
What if the Soviets
don't see the distinction?

1581
01:35:53,407 --> 01:35:55,875
What if they make
the same mistake I just made?

1582
01:35:56,605 --> 01:35:59,837
There will be no firing anything
near any Soviet ships

1583
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:01,506
without my express permission.

1584
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,487
Now is that understood,
Admiral?

1585
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:05,781
Is it?!

1586
01:36:08,492 --> 01:36:09,847
Yes, sir.

1587
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,828
And I will only issue
such instructions

1588
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,018
when ordered to
by the President.

1589
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:18,814
John Paul Jones!

1590
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,943
You don't understand a thing,
do you, Admiral?

1591
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:24,236
This isn't a blockade!

1592
01:36:24,341 --> 01:36:27,677
This is language?
A new vocabulary

1593
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,076
the likes of which the world
has never seen.

1594
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:31,952
This is President Kennedy

1595
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:35,289
communicating
with Secretary Khrushchev.

1596
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,678
Well, who the hell
authorized this missile test?

1597
01:36:49,782 --> 01:36:51,034
Who do you think?

1598
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:53,223
God knows what this is gonna
communicate to the Soviets.

1599
01:36:53,328 --> 01:36:55,204
Communicate with the Soviets?

1600
01:36:55,517 --> 01:36:57,498
We can't communicate
with the Pentagon,

1601
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:59,688
and it's just across
the goddamn river.

1602
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:01,669
LeMay must think
you're afraid of him.

1603
01:37:02,086 --> 01:37:04,067
I'm not taking that bait.

1604
01:37:04,484 --> 01:37:06,153
The right move here
is to move on.

1605
01:37:10,219 --> 01:37:12,930
<i>The United States Destroyer
Joseph P. Kennedy...</i>

1606
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:19,082
<i>This is the point</i>

1607
01:37:19,186 --> 01:37:21,272
<i>at which we are concerned</i>

1608
01:37:21,376 --> 01:37:23,774
<i>that there
might be shooting</i>

1609
01:37:23,878 --> 01:37:25,442
<i>among the ships at sea,</i>

1610
01:37:25,547 --> 01:37:28,362
<i>the possibility that invasion
might have to be undertaken</i>

1611
01:37:28,466 --> 01:37:31,177
<i>to assure that those bases
are eliminated.</i>

1612
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:33,263
<i>If invasion is undertaken,</i>

1613
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:35,557
<i>the Russians have said
that they would retaliate</i>

1614
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:37,433
<i>with rocket fire.</i>

1615
01:37:37,538 --> 01:37:39,519
<i>We have said if there's
rocket fire from Cuba,</i>

1616
01:37:39,623 --> 01:37:40,561
<i>we will retaliate,</i>

1617
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:43,898
<i>and there goes
the whole ballgame.</i>

1618
01:37:44,002 --> 01:37:44,941
Kenny.

1619
01:37:45,462 --> 01:37:46,818
What's this?

1620
01:37:47,235 --> 01:37:48,799
Can anyone just
walk in here now?

1621
01:37:48,903 --> 01:37:50,467
Ken, don't worry. I'm not
here to do an interview.

1622
01:37:50,571 --> 01:37:52,761
Well, if you're looking for a cup of
sugar, John, you got the wrong door.

1623
01:37:52,865 --> 01:37:55,993
Kenny, we need to see
the President.

1624
01:37:56,098 --> 01:37:57,210
Something's happened.

1625
01:37:57,245 --> 01:37:59,956
<i>The point of the crisis...
This is the point at which...</i>

1626
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,667
I have lunch with him,
maybe once a month.

1627
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:05,273
The way he talks, he acts like
he knows Khrushchev personally,

1628
01:38:05,378 --> 01:38:07,671
but he's never elaborated.

1629
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:10,487
I've used him as a source
in a couple of stories.

1630
01:38:10,695 --> 01:38:12,781
The FBI has identified
this Alexander Fomin

1631
01:38:12,885 --> 01:38:14,970
as the Soviet resident,

1632
01:38:15,075 --> 01:38:18,724
um, the KGB equivalent
of one of our Station Chiefs.

1633
01:38:18,933 --> 01:38:21,435
He's their highest-ranking
spy in this country,

1634
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:23,312
and he knows John's
a friend of mine.

1635
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:26,023
All the trademarks of
a back-channel overture.

1636
01:38:26,127 --> 01:38:28,734
Yeah. Some back channel.

1637
01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:32,383
ABC News guy, my goddamn
next-door neighbor.

1638
01:38:34,677 --> 01:38:36,241
So they'll remove the missiles,

1639
01:38:36,658 --> 01:38:39,578
and we'll pledge not to
invade Cuba or destabilize Castro

1640
01:38:39,682 --> 01:38:41,872
or assist anyone
who plans in doing so.

1641
01:38:46,251 --> 01:38:49,379
I think this may be our
first real message from Khrushchev.

1642
01:38:49,483 --> 01:38:51,465
The alternative,
Mr. President, is that

1643
01:38:51,569 --> 01:38:53,550
this could be a trap.

1644
01:38:53,758 --> 01:38:55,531
Mm-hmm.
And how is that exactly?

1645
01:38:56,052 --> 01:38:57,929
Dangle a settlement.

1646
01:38:58,033 --> 01:39:00,015
Tie us down in negotiation.
We come up short.

1647
01:39:01,474 --> 01:39:03,768
Why else would they
approach us this way?

1648
01:39:03,873 --> 01:39:04,915
It's deniable.

1649
01:39:05,332 --> 01:39:07,209
The Soviets have done
nothing but lie to us.

1650
01:39:07,313 --> 01:39:08,460
This could just be
more of the same.

1651
01:39:08,565 --> 01:39:11,380
That may be why Khrushchev's
introducing this guy.

1652
01:39:12,006 --> 01:39:14,299
We've been burned by his usual
players in the formal channels,

1653
01:39:14,404 --> 01:39:17,705
so he brings in
an honest broker.

1654
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,513
That may be what
they want us to think.

1655
01:39:20,243 --> 01:39:21,286
The truth is, Mr. President,

1656
01:39:21,494 --> 01:39:24,205
we don't even really know
who Fomin speaks for.

1657
01:39:24,518 --> 01:39:25,769
It could be Khrushchev.

1658
01:39:25,873 --> 01:39:28,428
It could be some faction
of the Politburo

1659
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:30,983
or the KGB itself.
We just don't know.

1660
01:39:31,295 --> 01:39:33,902
Oh, by the way, Scali,
your activities now fall under

1661
01:39:34,006 --> 01:39:36,822
the secrecy codicils
of the National Security Act.

1662
01:39:36,926 --> 01:39:39,533
Sorry, John. No Pulitzer.

1663
01:39:41,618 --> 01:39:43,808
Mr. President,
we haven't much time.

1664
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,414
I'm scheduled to meet
with him again in 31/2 hours.

1665
01:39:47,144 --> 01:39:49,230
So it seems
the question of the day is,

1666
01:39:49,334 --> 01:39:51,211
is the offer legitimate?

1667
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:53,713
And if it is...

1668
01:39:53,818 --> 01:39:55,590
Well, if it is,
we can't afford to ignore it.

1669
01:39:57,675 --> 01:39:59,240
So, John...

1670
01:40:00,282 --> 01:40:02,159
We'll have instructions
for you

1671
01:40:02,368 --> 01:40:04,244
in a couple of hours.

1672
01:40:04,279 --> 01:40:05,496
Thank you.

1673
01:40:07,685 --> 01:40:09,041
Thank you, John.

1674
01:40:11,022 --> 01:40:14,254
Sir, we don't have much time to
play out back-channel communiqués.

1675
01:40:19,363 --> 01:40:20,510
Kenny.

1676
01:40:23,534 --> 01:40:25,828
I need you to get over
to your old stomping grounds

1677
01:40:25,932 --> 01:40:28,226
and go through everything
the FBI has on Fomin,

1678
01:40:28,643 --> 01:40:30,625
And I need your best call?
Is the guy legit,

1679
01:40:30,729 --> 01:40:32,189
and is he speaking
for Khrushchev?

1680
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:37,194
OK, so what we got here is this guy
Alexander Feklisov, aka Alexander Fomin,

1681
01:40:37,298 --> 01:40:39,383
declared Counsel
to the Soviet Embassy,

1682
01:40:39,487 --> 01:40:42,407
but in reality
the KGB Papa spy.

1683
01:40:43,658 --> 01:40:46,578
An illustrious tour of duty
during the Great Patriotic War

1684
01:40:46,682 --> 01:40:48,767
gets him
on the Party fast track.

1685
01:40:48,872 --> 01:40:51,895
Various tours of duty in KGB.

1686
01:40:52,313 --> 01:40:54,398
American postings.
He's an expert on us,

1687
01:40:54,502 --> 01:40:57,422
and that is all that
we got on Papa spy.

1688
01:41:01,384 --> 01:41:04,303
How do you become the KGB
top spy in the United States?

1689
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:06,180
You gotta know someone.

1690
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,204
You gotta know someone.

1691
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,958
So, politics is politics.

1692
01:41:24,949 --> 01:41:26,617
Walter, get me
Khrushchev's files.

1693
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:28,598
Pass me that.

1694
01:41:28,702 --> 01:41:31,726
I want to see their career
chronology side by side.

1695
01:41:32,978 --> 01:41:35,689
- We know they're not related, right?
- Right.

1696
01:41:35,793 --> 01:41:38,191
They're not from
the same hometown.

1697
01:41:38,295 --> 01:41:39,546
They went
to different schools.

1698
01:41:39,581 --> 01:41:40,798
Right.

1699
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,822
So if they were gonna meet,

1700
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,011
they should have met here.

1701
01:41:46,115 --> 01:41:47,158
I think they could have met.

1702
01:41:47,262 --> 01:41:48,722
They couldn't have.

1703
01:41:49,035 --> 01:41:52,059
He was an engineer stationed
outside of Moscow at the end of '41.

1704
01:41:54,457 --> 01:41:55,917
That's it.

1705
01:41:56,855 --> 01:41:59,879
They know each other.
They're war buddies.

1706
01:41:59,983 --> 01:42:01,443
That's pretty thin, Kenny.

1707
01:42:01,652 --> 01:42:04,154
Well, real life
usually is, Walter.

1708
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:07,908
They know each other, Jack.

1709
01:42:08,116 --> 01:42:09,889
Khrushchev and Fomin
were war buddies.

1710
01:42:09,993 --> 01:42:10,932
You sure?

1711
01:42:11,036 --> 01:42:12,496
<i>Don't take it to court,
but we've got</i>

1712
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,164
good circumstantial evidence.

1713
01:42:14,268 --> 01:42:17,083
Well, you're there. I mean, what's
your instinct? I gotta move on this.

1714
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:21,984
My gut's telling me
that Khrushchev's turning

1715
01:42:22,088 --> 01:42:24,487
to a trusted old friend
to carry his message.

1716
01:42:26,885 --> 01:42:28,136
OK. We're going.

1717
01:42:30,638 --> 01:42:31,890
I've been instructed
to tell you

1718
01:42:31,994 --> 01:42:34,288
that the American Government
would respond favorably

1719
01:42:34,392 --> 01:42:37,207
to an offer along the lines
that you have discussed.

1720
01:42:37,624 --> 01:42:40,648
If such a solution were raised
at the U.N. By Ambassador Zorin,

1721
01:42:41,065 --> 01:42:44,506
he would find a favorable reply
from Ambassador Stevenson.

1722
01:42:45,132 --> 01:42:47,426
So, I understand you correctly.

1723
01:42:48,573 --> 01:42:52,118
If the missiles in Cuba
were dismantled,

1724
01:42:52,222 --> 01:42:54,203
returned to the Soviet Union

1725
01:42:54,307 --> 01:42:57,018
and a guarantee was made
not to reintroduce them,

1726
01:42:57,123 --> 01:42:59,000
the United States
would be prepared

1727
01:42:59,104 --> 01:43:02,336
to guarantee that
it would never invade Cuba?

1728
01:43:02,371 --> 01:43:04,005
That is correct.

1729
01:43:04,213 --> 01:43:05,881
And this is from
the Highest Authority?

1730
01:43:05,986 --> 01:43:07,341
Yes, the Highest Authority.

1731
01:43:09,218 --> 01:43:10,782
There are 2 conditions.

1732
01:43:10,886 --> 01:43:14,223
The U.N. Must be allowed to inspect
the removal of the missiles.

1733
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,830
Of course, the U.N.
Must also be allowed

1734
01:43:16,934 --> 01:43:18,498
to observe the redeployment

1735
01:43:18,602 --> 01:43:20,583
of forces from
the American Southeast.

1736
01:43:20,688 --> 01:43:22,147
I can't speak to that.

1737
01:43:23,816 --> 01:43:25,484
What's the second
condition, John?

1738
01:43:26,214 --> 01:43:27,569
Time is of the essence.

1739
01:43:27,674 --> 01:43:29,029
How much time?

1740
01:43:29,133 --> 01:43:30,072
48 hours.

1741
01:43:30,593 --> 01:43:33,930
In 48 hours,
there can be no deals.

1742
01:43:34,243 --> 01:43:35,807
Hoo hoo.

1743
01:43:37,058 --> 01:43:38,101
I'll see what I can do.

1744
01:43:55,931 --> 01:43:58,642
I think it's very difficult to
make a decision from this document.

1745
01:43:58,677 --> 01:44:00,936
Well, it looks to me like
Fomin's overture was genuine.

1746
01:44:01,144 --> 01:44:02,500
That's a big "if," Bobby.

1747
01:44:02,604 --> 01:44:04,168
It's 10 pages
of sentimental fluff,

1748
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:06,149
but he's saying it right here.

1749
01:44:06,184 --> 01:44:07,400
He'll remove the missiles

1750
01:44:07,504 --> 01:44:09,381
in return for
a no-invasion pledge.

1751
01:44:09,486 --> 01:44:11,988
Mm-hmm. Mr. President,
our early analysis says

1752
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:15,116
this probably was written
by Khrushchev himself.

1753
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:16,784
It's a first draft.
It shows no signs

1754
01:44:16,993 --> 01:44:19,183
of being polished
by the Foreign Ministry.

1755
01:44:19,391 --> 01:44:21,268
In fact, it probably wasn't
even approved by the Politburo

1756
01:44:21,372 --> 01:44:23,875
as they wouldn't let
the emotionalism go by.

1757
01:44:24,188 --> 01:44:26,064
The analysts say it
was written by someone

1758
01:44:26,169 --> 01:44:28,358
under considerable stress.

1759
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:31,382
Glad to know we're not alone.

1760
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:37,638
Well, it never was my intention
to invade Cuba anyway...

1761
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:39,932
Until they put
the missiles in there.

1762
01:44:42,018 --> 01:44:43,060
Gentlemen, I think

1763
01:44:43,165 --> 01:44:46,397
we should
seriously consider this deal.

1764
01:45:20,493 --> 01:45:22,474
- Hi.
- Hi.

1765
01:45:23,308 --> 01:45:25,394
You look old, O'Donnell.

1766
01:45:26,436 --> 01:45:27,792
You don't.

1767
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:30,294
It's 2:30 in the morning.

1768
01:45:30,816 --> 01:45:32,588
You flirting with me?

1769
01:45:34,778 --> 01:45:37,593
We got a back-channel communication
from Khrushchev this evening,

1770
01:45:37,697 --> 01:45:39,887
feeling us out about a deal.

1771
01:45:40,617 --> 01:45:41,972
He confirmed it

1772
01:45:42,077 --> 01:45:43,432
just a little while ago
in a letter.

1773
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:46,247
Thank God.

1774
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,001
Jack kicked us out of
his house for the night.

1775
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:52,608
Darn it.

1776
01:45:52,816 --> 01:45:54,693
For a second there,
I thought you'd been fired.

1777
01:45:55,632 --> 01:45:57,196
No such luck.

1778
01:46:03,973 --> 01:46:05,954
You know,
I'm driving home...

1779
01:46:07,831 --> 01:46:10,229
there was something
I wanted to tell you.

1780
01:46:18,154 --> 01:46:20,031
Finish that thought.

1781
01:46:23,784 --> 01:46:24,618
Yes?

1782
01:46:24,723 --> 01:46:27,329
<i>Kenny, it's Bob. We're getting
another letter over the teletype</i>

1783
01:46:27,434 --> 01:46:29,415
<i>from Khrushchev.
I have a bad feeling.</i>

1784
01:46:29,519 --> 01:46:31,187
Ok, I'll be right there.

1785
01:46:38,069 --> 01:46:39,633
You're beautiful.

1786
01:46:46,202 --> 01:46:48,183
It looks like Fomin
was a ploy after all,

1787
01:46:48,288 --> 01:46:50,581
and they were just
stalling for time.

1788
01:46:57,568 --> 01:46:58,610
It gets worse.

1789
01:47:00,174 --> 01:47:03,511
Gentlemen,
my specialists are in agreement.

1790
01:47:03,928 --> 01:47:05,701
This morning's letter
is not Khrushchev.

1791
01:47:05,805 --> 01:47:07,682
Last night's letter was.

1792
01:47:07,994 --> 01:47:10,080
The evidence supports
only one conclusion.

1793
01:47:10,288 --> 01:47:13,312
There's been a coup, and
Khrushchev was replaced overnight.

1794
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:14,772
Dean?

1795
01:47:14,876 --> 01:47:16,232
At the very least,
it does suggest

1796
01:47:16,336 --> 01:47:18,630
he's been co-opted
by hard-line elements.

1797
01:47:18,838 --> 01:47:21,028
Which at the end of the day,
amounts to the same thing.

1798
01:47:21,132 --> 01:47:22,384
A puppet Khrushchev

1799
01:47:22,488 --> 01:47:25,199
and a hard-line Soviet Government
pulling the strings.

1800
01:47:25,303 --> 01:47:28,118
No deal, and the missiles
are almost operational.

1801
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,559
What if the Soviets have no intention
of honoring this second deal?

1802
01:47:31,664 --> 01:47:34,062
Then tomorrow,
they make another condition.

1803
01:47:34,097 --> 01:47:36,460
Meanwhile,
the quarantine isn't working,

1804
01:47:36,564 --> 01:47:38,858
and they're completing work
on the missile sites.

1805
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:43,237
Sir, I think we have to issue
pre-invasion orders for our forces.

1806
01:47:43,759 --> 01:47:45,323
Mr. President,

1807
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,200
this morning's
photography is in.

1808
01:47:48,242 --> 01:47:50,015
It appears the Soviets
have commenced

1809
01:47:50,119 --> 01:47:52,205
a crash program
to ready their missiles.

1810
01:47:52,517 --> 01:47:55,541
The first missiles became
operational last night.

1811
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:58,565
We expect they'll all
be operational in 36 hours.

1812
01:47:58,669 --> 01:48:00,859
Then we're out of time.
We have to go in.

1813
01:48:00,963 --> 01:48:03,049
That may not be as easy
as we thought, either.

1814
01:48:03,153 --> 01:48:04,300
We have gotten confirmation

1815
01:48:04,404 --> 01:48:05,655
the Soviets
have also deployed

1816
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,636
battlefield
nuclear weapons to Cuba.

1817
01:48:07,845 --> 01:48:11,599
FROGs, we call 'em.
Short-range tactical nukes.

1818
01:48:11,911 --> 01:48:13,788
Now, we don't know
whether they've delegated

1819
01:48:13,893 --> 01:48:15,874
release authority
to their local commanders

1820
01:48:16,082 --> 01:48:17,959
for use on
our invasion troops,

1821
01:48:18,063 --> 01:48:19,210
but the good news is,

1822
01:48:19,315 --> 01:48:21,608
as of this moment,
we know where the FROGs are,

1823
01:48:21,713 --> 01:48:23,277
and we can target them, too.

1824
01:48:24,632 --> 01:48:26,057
But the longer we wait,

1825
01:48:26,092 --> 01:48:28,177
the harder it's going to get.

1826
01:48:44,548 --> 01:48:46,007
We have no choice.

1827
01:48:51,012 --> 01:48:52,994
General,
issue orders to our forces

1828
01:48:53,098 --> 01:48:56,122
to be prepared to execute
the air strikes Monday morning.

1829
01:48:56,851 --> 01:48:58,520
And the follow-on invasion

1830
01:48:58,624 --> 01:48:59,980
according to
the schedule thereafter.

1831
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,255
I'll need the official release
orders on my desk on Sunday night.

1832
01:49:04,359 --> 01:49:05,402
Understood, sir.

1833
01:49:06,444 --> 01:49:08,321
We'll need to step up
our overflights,

1834
01:49:08,425 --> 01:49:10,458
finalize our pilots'
target folders

1835
01:49:10,493 --> 01:49:12,492
in order to carry out
the strikes.

1836
01:49:13,952 --> 01:49:16,037
- Permission granted.
- Yes, sir.

1837
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:28,514
Well, gentlemen,

1838
01:49:28,549 --> 01:49:31,260
if anybody's got
any great ideas, now's the time.

1839
01:49:40,436 --> 01:49:42,521
Major Anderson, there's
a phone call for you.

1840
01:49:42,626 --> 01:49:43,564
Thank you.

1841
01:49:43,668 --> 01:49:46,484
All right. Give me
just a second here, guys.

1842
01:49:50,237 --> 01:49:52,218
This is Major Anderson.

1843
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:54,304
<i>Hello?</i>

1844
01:49:54,617 --> 01:49:55,659
<i>Hello, anyone there?</i>

1845
01:49:55,764 --> 01:49:57,328
<i>- Major?
- Yes, sir?</i>

1846
01:49:57,745 --> 01:50:00,560
My name is Kenneth O'Donnell,
Special Assistant to the President.

1847
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:04,001
<i>Major, a few days ago,
the President ordered me</i>

1848
01:50:04,105 --> 01:50:05,565
to help him keep control

1849
01:50:05,669 --> 01:50:07,546
of what's going on out there.

1850
01:50:08,484 --> 01:50:11,404
I've been—I've been
browbeating pilots,

1851
01:50:11,508 --> 01:50:13,802
you know, Navy guys
left and right

1852
01:50:13,906 --> 01:50:16,305
to make sure you don't get us
here in Washington into trouble.

1853
01:50:17,556 --> 01:50:19,016
<i>But you know what?</i>

1854
01:50:20,684 --> 01:50:23,082
We're pretty damn good ourselves
at getting into trouble,

1855
01:50:23,186 --> 01:50:25,167
so instead of
riding your ass,

1856
01:50:25,376 --> 01:50:29,025
I'm just gonna tell you what's
going on here and let you figure out

1857
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:31,007
<i>how best to help us out up here.</i>

1858
01:50:31,111 --> 01:50:32,466
Go ahead, sir.

1859
01:50:33,196 --> 01:50:34,865
<i>Last night, it, uh...</i>

1860
01:50:35,282 --> 01:50:38,305
<i>looked like we were going to cut a
deal to get us all out of this mess.</i>

1861
01:50:39,035 --> 01:50:41,225
Today, the Soviets
are reneging.

1862
01:50:42,059 --> 01:50:45,187
We're gonna try and
salvage the situation, but

1863
01:50:45,709 --> 01:50:47,898
a lot of things
are going wrong today.

1864
01:50:48,628 --> 01:50:50,609
<i>It's making everyone nervous.</i>

1865
01:50:51,548 --> 01:50:52,486
<i>And when things go wrong,</i>

1866
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:54,154
<i>people will become
more nervous,</i>

1867
01:50:54,259 --> 01:50:57,595
and it will be very hard
to avoid going to war.

1868
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:01,662
I'm not sure what you're
tying to tell me, sir.

1869
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:04,373
<i>Just my standard line</i>

1870
01:51:04,477 --> 01:51:07,292
I've been repeating
to guys like you all week.

1871
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:10,108
Don't get shot down.

1872
01:51:11,984 --> 01:51:15,947
Beyond that, whatever else you can
do to help us I'd appreciate it.

1873
01:51:15,982 --> 01:51:17,198
Sir...

1874
01:51:20,534 --> 01:51:21,994
When you're at 72,000 feet,

1875
01:51:22,098 --> 01:51:24,392
there's a million things
that can go wrong. I mean,

1876
01:51:25,956 --> 01:51:28,876
<i>Is your oxygen mix right?
Are your cameras gonna freeze up?</i>

1877
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:31,587
<i>Are you leaving a contrail?
Those million things,</i>

1878
01:51:31,796 --> 01:51:34,089
<i>they're beyond
your control mostly.</i>

1879
01:51:34,402 --> 01:51:35,653
<i>But...</i>

1880
01:51:37,322 --> 01:51:39,199
<i>You know,
when you realize that,</i>

1881
01:51:39,303 --> 01:51:42,118
<i>there's a kind of peace,
you know?</i>

1882
01:51:42,222 --> 01:51:44,933
If you're a good man and
if your ground crew are good men,

1883
01:51:45,142 --> 01:51:46,706
that is all you can ask for.

1884
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:48,896
With the grace of God,
that'll get you through.

1885
01:51:50,251 --> 01:51:52,024
Are you a religious man?

1886
01:51:52,441 --> 01:51:53,796
Yes, sir, I am.

1887
01:51:56,299 --> 01:51:57,654
Good.

1888
01:54:22,067 --> 01:54:23,423
The plane is missing, Kenny.

1889
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:27,072
We are presuming
the pilot is dead.

1890
01:54:40,001 --> 01:54:41,565
Well, it's hard to believe,

1891
01:54:41,670 --> 01:54:44,172
with the Soviet centralized
command structure,

1892
01:54:44,276 --> 01:54:46,049
that this could've been
an accidental launch.

1893
01:54:46,153 --> 01:54:48,447
The question is, does
this attack on our plane

1894
01:54:48,482 --> 01:54:50,741
represent a definitive
intentional escalation

1895
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,201
on the part of the Soviets?

1896
01:54:52,409 --> 01:54:53,765
Mr. President,

1897
01:54:53,869 --> 01:54:55,850
taken with the events
of the past few hours,

1898
01:54:55,955 --> 01:54:58,666
I believe this confirms
our worst fears.

1899
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:00,855
We're now dealing with
a hard-line Soviet Government,

1900
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,566
Perhaps with Khrushchev as a puppet
head, perhaps not. We don't know.

1901
01:55:03,671 --> 01:55:04,922
You OK?

1902
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:06,486
Yeah.

1903
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,258
I'm fine.

1904
01:55:10,344 --> 01:55:11,491
Mr. President...

1905
01:55:12,116 --> 01:55:12,950
What now?

1906
01:55:13,055 --> 01:55:15,105
A U-2 on a routine
air-sampling mission

1907
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:17,747
got lost and penetrated
Soviet airspace over Siberia.

1908
01:55:17,851 --> 01:55:19,415
Oh, God damn it!

1909
01:55:19,519 --> 01:55:22,022
Soviets scrambled MIGs in pursuit,
thinking it was a bomber.

1910
01:55:22,230 --> 01:55:23,482
Got out OK.

1911
01:55:23,586 --> 01:55:25,046
Somebody forgot
to cancel the mission.

1912
01:55:25,254 --> 01:55:27,861
You know, there's always some son
of a bitch who doesn't get the word.

1913
01:55:27,965 --> 01:55:29,946
You know, this is
just what we need.

1914
01:55:30,468 --> 01:55:32,240
Soviets thinking
we're bombing them.

1915
01:55:36,515 --> 01:55:37,662
Anybody else?

1916
01:55:37,767 --> 01:55:39,296
Mr. President,

1917
01:55:39,331 --> 01:55:41,589
our pilots are in danger.

1918
01:55:41,624 --> 01:55:44,335
We must order punitive air strikes
against the SAM site

1919
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,691
that shot down Major Anderson

1920
01:55:45,795 --> 01:55:47,985
per our rules of engagement.

1921
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:05,502
No.

1922
01:56:06,858 --> 01:56:09,047
I want confirmation it wasn't
some sort of accident first.

1923
01:56:09,152 --> 01:56:10,090
Mr. President.

1924
01:56:10,194 --> 01:56:12,175
I think that's
a good idea, Mr. President.

1925
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:13,948
I can wait a day and a half.

1926
01:56:14,365 --> 01:56:16,555
Be safer for my boys to
get the SAMs on Monday

1927
01:56:16,659 --> 01:56:19,161
when we get the rest
of the bastards.

1928
01:57:27,771 --> 01:57:30,169
Hut... hut!

1929
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:35,069
Yeah, yeah.

1930
01:57:52,065 --> 01:57:53,212
Break!

1931
01:58:11,147 --> 01:58:12,711
That's the quarter.

1932
01:58:19,384 --> 01:58:21,156
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Sport.

1933
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:23,033
- You winning?
- Yeah.

1934
01:58:24,702 --> 01:58:26,995
Is everything
gonna be OK, Dad?

1935
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:30,958
Everything's gonna
be fine, Kenny.

1936
01:58:32,835 --> 01:58:35,337
I guess you won't
be coming home tonight.

1937
01:58:39,716 --> 01:58:40,968
I, uh...

1938
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:44,930
I?

1939
01:58:45,347 --> 01:58:48,058
Let's go!
Second quarter!

1940
01:58:51,812 --> 01:58:53,793
It's OK. Go on back
to your game.

1941
01:58:54,523 --> 01:58:55,669
All right.
I'll see you around, Dad.

1942
01:58:59,319 --> 01:59:01,196
First down!

1943
01:59:07,452 --> 01:59:08,807
Break!

1944
01:59:28,514 --> 01:59:29,661
Damn it!

1945
01:59:32,789 --> 01:59:33,936
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1946
01:59:34,041 --> 01:59:35,917
Take off for 2 hours,
you're gonna miss a little drama.

1947
01:59:36,022 --> 01:59:38,524
I told you how stupid it was
to float that Lippmann article.

1948
01:59:38,559 --> 01:59:39,775
Now you're gonna
do it for real?

1949
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,235
The Jupiters
are obsolete, Kenny.

1950
01:59:41,339 --> 01:59:42,695
They were supposed
to have been dismantled?

1951
01:59:42,799 --> 01:59:45,197
I know they're obsolete!
That's not the point.

1952
01:59:46,031 --> 01:59:48,951
The point is, you trade our missiles
in Turkey for theirs in Cuba,

1953
01:59:49,055 --> 01:59:51,141
they're gonna force us
into trade after trade,

1954
01:59:51,349 --> 01:59:53,295
until finally,
a couple of months from now,

1955
01:59:53,330 --> 01:59:56,146
they demand something
we won't trade, like Berlin,

1956
01:59:56,875 --> 01:59:58,961
and we do end up in a war.

1957
01:59:59,274 --> 02:00:00,838
Not to mention that
long before that happens,

1958
02:00:00,942 --> 02:00:03,132
this administration
will be politically dead.

1959
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,800
I don't care
if this administration

1960
02:00:04,904 --> 02:00:06,260
ends up in the freaking toilet!

1961
02:00:06,364 --> 02:00:08,345
We don't do a deal tonight,
there won't be any administration.

1962
02:00:08,449 --> 02:00:09,701
It's the wrong move, Bobby,

1963
02:00:09,805 --> 02:00:11,682
and it's not just me
who thinks that.

1964
02:00:11,786 --> 02:00:15,227
Everyone on this so-called EXCOM is
telling you exactly the same thing.

1965
02:00:16,478 --> 02:00:18,146
Well, whose side
are you on now, Ken?

1966
02:00:18,251 --> 02:00:21,066
Oh... God damn it.

1967
02:00:23,568 --> 02:00:25,862
What if there hasn't
been a coup at all?

1968
02:00:27,322 --> 02:00:29,199
What if it's you two?

1969
02:00:29,825 --> 02:00:32,292
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What if it was you two

1970
02:00:32,327 --> 02:00:36,289
who invited that second letter by
raising the possibility of a trade?

1971
02:00:43,171 --> 02:00:45,882
Mr. President, we have
only 30 hours left,

1972
02:00:45,986 --> 02:00:47,342
and whatever response we send,

1973
02:00:47,446 --> 02:00:49,114
it will take several
hours for the wire

1974
02:00:49,219 --> 02:00:52,451
to be received by our Embassy
and delivered to the Kremlin.

1975
02:00:52,868 --> 02:00:54,797
So we're looking at
early tomorrow morning

1976
02:00:54,832 --> 02:00:56,726
at the earliest before
Khrushchev can respond.

1977
02:00:58,186 --> 02:00:59,193
Which one of you geniuses

1978
02:00:59,228 --> 02:01:01,001
is gonna tell me
how to explain it to the world

1979
02:01:01,105 --> 02:01:02,044
if we don't make this trade?

1980
02:01:04,650 --> 02:01:06,527
So, what are we gonna
say to the Soviets

1981
02:01:07,049 --> 02:01:08,196
about this offer?

1982
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:11,115
Well, it depends,
doesn't it? I mean,

1983
02:01:11,636 --> 02:01:14,035
Do we really believe
there's been a coup?

1984
02:01:14,452 --> 02:01:16,746
What if Fomin wasn't a ploy?

1985
02:01:17,058 --> 02:01:18,623
What if his message was real?

1986
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:22,376
What if what is happening
is a series of accidents?

1987
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,983
Accidents like them
shooting down our U-2?

1988
02:01:27,173 --> 02:01:28,737
Yes, accidents like that.

1989
02:01:28,841 --> 02:01:32,282
And the accident's making the
second letter seem more aggressive

1990
02:01:32,699 --> 02:01:35,201
and the whole situation
appear worse than it really is.

1991
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:38,434
- "The Guns of August".
- That's right.

1992
02:01:38,955 --> 02:01:41,145
So we just reject
the second letter?

1993
02:01:42,292 --> 02:01:44,168
No. No, no.

1994
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:46,045
We don't reject it.

1995
02:01:46,150 --> 02:01:47,505
We accept the first letter

1996
02:01:47,609 --> 02:01:50,320
and pretend the second
letter doesn't exist.

1997
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:54,491
It won't work because
that's wishful thinking!

1998
02:01:54,595 --> 02:01:55,638
He made an offer, so I?

1999
02:01:55,742 --> 02:01:57,828
That's the same
wishful thinking, Bobby,

2000
02:01:57,863 --> 02:01:59,288
that blinded us
all these months

2001
02:01:59,392 --> 02:02:02,416
while the Soviets were sneaking
those missiles in under our noses.

2002
02:02:02,451 --> 02:02:03,771
Ignore the second letter,

2003
02:02:03,875 --> 02:02:05,127
agree to the conditions
of the first.

2004
02:02:05,335 --> 02:02:07,316
There's no reason to believe
the Soviets will let it go.

2005
02:02:07,421 --> 02:02:09,923
Max is right.
Why will they accept it?

2006
02:02:09,958 --> 02:02:11,800
It can work if?

2007
02:02:11,904 --> 02:02:13,677
If they believe
we're gonna hit 'em,

2008
02:02:13,781 --> 02:02:15,554
and hit 'em hard.
We've got time

2009
02:02:15,658 --> 02:02:17,847
for one more round
of diplomacy, and that's it.

2010
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:20,141
The first air strikes
start in 28 hours.

2011
02:02:20,246 --> 02:02:22,018
But we have to make
them agree to it.

2012
02:02:22,053 --> 02:02:23,269
Right. So how do we do that?

2013
02:02:23,374 --> 02:02:24,521
Well, we give them something.

2014
02:02:24,729 --> 02:02:27,232
We tell 'em we're gonna remove
the missiles from Turkey?

2015
02:02:27,267 --> 02:02:28,274
Hang on!

2016
02:02:28,379 --> 02:02:29,838
But we do that
6 months from now,

2017
02:02:29,943 --> 02:02:32,028
so it appears
there's no linkage.

2018
02:02:32,237 --> 02:02:35,156
We also tell 'em if they go
public about it, we'll deny it.

2019
02:02:35,365 --> 02:02:36,824
Right. We deny it.
The deal's off.

2020
02:02:37,033 --> 02:02:39,535
And we do it under the table, so
we can disavow any knowledge of it.

2021
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:42,038
It's transparent, Kenny.
The press'll be all over it.

2022
02:02:42,142 --> 02:02:44,853
6 months from now, we're
not gonna care, are we?

2023
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,313
We'll deal with it then.

2024
02:02:46,417 --> 02:02:49,545
At the least, it'll expose whether
Khrushchev has been overthrown.

2025
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:50,796
We'll know who
we're up against.

2026
02:02:50,901 --> 02:02:52,361
Well, I've been thinking
about Khrushchev,

2027
02:02:52,465 --> 02:02:54,133
and if this is
a move to appease

2028
02:02:54,237 --> 02:02:56,010
the hard-liners
in his Government,

2029
02:02:56,114 --> 02:02:57,783
then it may be
just the bone he needs

2030
02:02:57,887 --> 02:02:59,347
to regain control
of his own house.

2031
02:02:59,451 --> 02:03:02,683
Whoever carries the message
has to hit the nail on the head.

2032
02:03:03,309 --> 02:03:05,603
Come across as too soft,
they'll push us.

2033
02:03:05,811 --> 02:03:08,314
Too hard, they'll be cornered,
and even more dangerous.

2034
02:03:08,349 --> 02:03:09,565
All of you?

2035
02:03:09,773 --> 02:03:10,990
All of you do understand

2036
02:03:11,025 --> 02:03:13,944
that there is an enormous risk
in offering this deal.

2037
02:03:14,674 --> 02:03:16,655
Because if they turn us down,
and we've already told them

2038
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:18,324
that we're coming in
on Monday morning...

2039
02:03:18,532 --> 02:03:20,617
- They'll strike first.
- Yes.

2040
02:03:23,954 --> 02:03:24,788
Bobby.

2041
02:03:25,831 --> 02:03:27,082
You know Dobrynin best.

2042
02:03:27,916 --> 02:03:28,750
Yeah.

2043
02:03:30,627 --> 02:03:32,087
Then you're it.

2044
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:36,049
Ted, I want you to
start working on the draft.

2045
02:03:36,154 --> 02:03:38,448
And, Bobby, you gotta go in there.
You gotta make them understand

2046
02:03:39,386 --> 02:03:41,054
that we have to have
an answer tomorrow,

2047
02:03:41,367 --> 02:03:43,661
because Monday we go to war.

2048
02:04:01,387 --> 02:04:03,576
What do you want?
A good-bye kiss?

2049
02:04:06,913 --> 02:04:09,798
Hey, Joe, listen.
I'll take care of him.

2050
02:04:09,833 --> 02:04:12,126
Go on inside. Grab some coffee.
We'll be back pretty quick.

2051
02:04:12,335 --> 02:04:13,691
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

2052
02:04:13,795 --> 02:04:15,463
What's the matter with you?

2053
02:04:15,567 --> 02:04:17,236
Forget how to open
a car door?

2054
02:04:20,259 --> 02:04:21,719
Jesus.

2055
02:04:22,449 --> 02:04:23,909
You rich people.

2056
02:04:33,189 --> 02:04:36,213
I promised the girls
I'd take them riding tomorrow.

2057
02:04:38,715 --> 02:04:40,279
Make sure
you keep that date.

2058
02:04:43,824 --> 02:04:46,327
We gave up so much to get here.

2059
02:04:48,412 --> 02:04:50,915
I don't know. Sometimes I think,
what the hell did we do it for?

2060
02:04:51,957 --> 02:04:53,938
Well, I don't know
about you, but

2061
02:04:54,147 --> 02:04:55,920
I'm in it for the money.

2062
02:05:02,384 --> 02:05:05,304
We knew we could do
a better job than everyone else.

2063
02:05:05,929 --> 02:05:06,972
Remember?

2064
02:05:08,432 --> 02:05:09,996
You know, I...

2065
02:05:11,768 --> 02:05:15,209
I—I hate being called
the brilliant one,

2066
02:05:15,731 --> 02:05:17,712
the ruthless one...

2067
02:05:18,233 --> 02:05:20,527
The guy everybody's afraid of.

2068
02:05:20,944 --> 02:05:22,404
I hate it.

2069
02:05:23,759 --> 02:05:26,158
I'm not so smart, you know?

2070
02:05:27,409 --> 02:05:28,973
I'm not so ruthless.

2071
02:05:29,181 --> 02:05:31,475
Well, you're right
about the smart part.

2072
02:05:41,798 --> 02:05:43,466
I don't know if I can do this.

2073
02:05:45,135 --> 02:05:47,220
There's nobody else
I'd rather have going in there

2074
02:05:47,637 --> 02:05:48,993
than you?

2075
02:05:49,305 --> 02:05:51,808
Nobody else
I'd trust Helen and...

2076
02:05:51,912 --> 02:05:53,163
the kids' lives to.

2077
02:05:56,396 --> 02:05:57,647
Take a left.

2078
02:06:17,771 --> 02:06:19,126
You smell that?

2079
02:06:19,543 --> 02:06:21,629
They're burning
their documents.

2080
02:06:22,776 --> 02:06:25,174
They think we're going to war.

2081
02:06:27,259 --> 02:06:29,136
God help us, Ken.

2082
02:07:12,304 --> 02:07:15,745
Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already
here. He's waiting in your office.

2083
02:07:16,996 --> 02:07:18,143
Here.

2084
02:07:26,901 --> 02:07:29,091
I'll whistle up
some luck for you.

2085
02:07:37,641 --> 02:07:40,144
Mr. Ambassador. Thank you.

2086
02:08:33,008 --> 02:08:34,468
Who are you?

2087
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,876
A friend.

2088
02:09:08,772 --> 02:09:11,900
My brother, my friends,
my countrymen, and I

2089
02:09:12,005 --> 02:09:13,569
cannot and will not permit

2090
02:09:13,673 --> 02:09:15,237
those missiles
to become operational.

2091
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:16,593
I promise you that.

2092
02:09:16,697 --> 02:09:19,721
Then I fear our 2 nations
will go to war...

2093
02:09:20,346 --> 02:09:22,953
And I fear
where war will lead us.

2094
02:09:23,057 --> 02:09:25,872
If the missiles do not
become operational,

2095
02:09:26,185 --> 02:09:27,645
if you remove the missiles,

2096
02:09:27,749 --> 02:09:29,730
then there will be no war.

2097
02:09:31,086 --> 02:09:33,276
At this moment, the President
is accepting the terms

2098
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:36,091
of Secretary Khrushchev's
letter of Friday night.

2099
02:09:36,612 --> 02:09:39,479
If the Soviet Union
halts construction immediately,

2100
02:09:39,514 --> 02:09:42,347
removes the missiles,
and submits to U.N. Inspection,

2101
02:09:42,451 --> 02:09:44,120
the United States will pledge

2102
02:09:44,328 --> 02:09:47,873
to never invade Cuba or
aid others in that enterprise.

2103
02:09:47,978 --> 02:09:51,210
If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey
were removed also,

2104
02:09:51,418 --> 02:09:53,921
such an accommodation
could be reached.

2105
02:09:54,651 --> 02:09:56,423
That's not possible.

2106
02:09:59,447 --> 02:10:02,888
The United States cannot
agree to such terms under threat.

2107
02:10:03,931 --> 02:10:07,163
Any belief to the contrary
was in error.

2108
02:10:08,519 --> 02:10:09,978
You want war?

2109
02:10:20,822 --> 02:10:21,969
However...

2110
02:10:22,074 --> 02:10:25,097
While there can be
no quid pro quo on this issue,

2111
02:10:25,306 --> 02:10:28,330
the United States can offer
a private assurance.

2112
02:10:30,415 --> 02:10:32,883
Now, our Jupiter missiles
in Turkey are obsolete

2113
02:10:32,918 --> 02:10:35,629
and have been scheduled
for withdrawal for some time.

2114
02:10:36,254 --> 02:10:40,008
This withdrawal should take place
within, say, 6 months.

2115
02:10:40,946 --> 02:10:42,719
Of course,
any public disclosure

2116
02:10:42,927 --> 02:10:45,395
of this assurance
would negate the deal

2117
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:48,558
and produce the most stringent
denials from our Government.

2118
02:10:49,392 --> 02:10:51,269
This private assurance

2119
02:10:51,373 --> 02:10:54,084
represents the word
of the Highest Authority?

2120
02:10:55,231 --> 02:10:56,170
Yes.

2121
02:10:57,108 --> 02:10:59,610
And it can be relayed beyond
Comrade Khrushchev's ears

2122
02:10:59,819 --> 02:11:02,113
to the top circles
of my Government?

2123
02:11:02,530 --> 02:11:04,824
Our pledge can be relayed
to any Government officials

2124
02:11:04,859 --> 02:11:07,952
Secretary Khrushchev
sees fit to satisfy,

2125
02:11:08,682 --> 02:11:11,289
with the caveat that
it is not to be made public

2126
02:11:11,497 --> 02:11:14,104
in any way, shape, or form.

2127
02:11:18,275 --> 02:11:20,569
And we must have
an answer tomorrow,

2128
02:11:20,986 --> 02:11:22,028
at the latest.

2129
02:11:22,133 --> 02:11:24,427
I cannot stress
this point enough.

2130
02:11:25,052 --> 02:11:26,720
Tomorrow?

2131
02:11:28,076 --> 02:11:29,223
Tomorrow.

2132
02:11:31,308 --> 02:11:34,332
Then you must excuse me
and permit me to relay

2133
02:11:34,541 --> 02:11:37,043
the substance of our discussion
to my superiors.

2134
02:11:37,147 --> 02:11:38,503
Of course.

2135
02:11:40,901 --> 02:11:44,759
We have heard stories that some
of your military men wish for war.

2136
02:11:46,636 --> 02:11:48,408
You're a good man.

2137
02:11:48,617 --> 02:11:50,285
Your brother is a good man.

2138
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:53,101
I assure you
there are other good men.

2139
02:11:53,726 --> 02:11:54,977
Let us hope
the will of good men

2140
02:11:55,082 --> 02:11:56,959
is enough to counter
the terrible strength

2141
02:11:57,063 --> 02:11:59,982
of this thing
that was put in motion.

2142
02:12:42,211 --> 02:12:43,984
What's going to happen?

2143
02:12:47,216 --> 02:12:49,719
If the sun comes up tomorrow,

2144
02:12:51,074 --> 02:12:53,994
it is only because
of men of good will.

2145
02:12:56,601 --> 02:12:58,060
And that's...

2146
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:01,814
That's all there is
between us and the Devil.

2147
02:13:36,223 --> 02:13:38,934
<i>This is Radio Moscow.</i>

2148
02:13:39,247 --> 02:13:41,645
<i>Premier Khrushchev
has sent a message</i>

2149
02:13:41,749 --> 02:13:44,147
<i>to President Kennedy today.</i>

2150
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:46,441
<i>The Soviet Prime Minister
reemphasizes</i>

2151
02:13:46,650 --> 02:13:50,925
<i>the need for urgent measures
to prevent a fatal turn of events</i>

2152
02:13:51,029 --> 02:13:52,697
<i>and to preserve world peace.</i>

2153
02:13:54,366 --> 02:13:57,389
<i>In addition to instructions
earlier transmitted</i>

2154
02:13:57,494 --> 02:14:00,413
<i>to stop construction work
on installations in Cuba,</i>

2155
02:14:00,622 --> 02:14:02,186
<i>the Soviet Government
has ordered</i>

2156
02:14:02,290 --> 02:14:05,001
<i>the dismantling
of weapons in Cuba,</i>

2157
02:14:05,105 --> 02:14:06,252
<i>as well as their crating</i>

2158
02:14:06,357 --> 02:14:08,651
<i>and return to the Soviet Union.</i>

2159
02:14:20,224 --> 02:14:22,310
Is everybody ready for church?

2160
02:14:30,443 --> 02:14:32,424
It's a beautiful morning.

2161
02:14:36,595 --> 02:14:38,472
Pass the butter up to Dad.

2162
02:14:43,894 --> 02:14:45,979
Dad, you want your paper?

2163
02:14:50,358 --> 02:14:52,235
Dad, what's wrong?

2164
02:14:56,927 --> 02:14:58,804
The sun came up.

2165
02:15:00,577 --> 02:15:03,809
Every day the sun comes up
says something about us.

2166
02:15:13,923 --> 02:15:15,904
What does it say, Dad?

2167
02:15:17,468 --> 02:15:19,658
What's wrong with Daddy?

2168
02:15:54,692 --> 02:15:57,090
This is the foreign policy trophy
we were hoping for.

2169
02:15:57,195 --> 02:15:58,655
Mr. President, sir.

2170
02:16:02,825 --> 02:16:04,911
Mr. President, great job.

2171
02:16:05,223 --> 02:16:07,205
Hold it, hold it.

2172
02:16:07,726 --> 02:16:09,499
Well, Mr. President,

2173
02:16:09,707 --> 02:16:12,210
I think I can speak
for everyone here

2174
02:16:12,418 --> 02:16:14,921
when I say,
"Bring on those mid-terms,

2175
02:16:15,025 --> 02:16:17,006
there's no stopping us now. "

2176
02:16:18,153 --> 02:16:20,343
- 4 more years.
- All right.

2177
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:23,992
You know, it's been
a long 2 weeks, and...

2178
02:16:24,096 --> 02:16:25,347
or whatever, but...

2179
02:16:25,452 --> 02:16:27,746
I'd like to thank you all.
I think you all did a great job,

2180
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:29,310
and I just think...

2181
02:16:30,144 --> 02:16:33,480
I don't think we should be
gloating too much.

2182
02:16:34,627 --> 02:16:36,191
It was...

2183
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,798
just as much a victory
for them as it was for us.

2184
02:16:38,902 --> 02:16:40,362
Hear, hear.

2185
02:16:40,466 --> 02:16:41,613
Enjoy your morning.

2186
02:16:41,822 --> 02:16:43,699
Thank you, Mr. President.

2187
02:16:46,201 --> 02:16:47,557
Get some rest, Mr. President.

2188
02:16:49,121 --> 02:16:51,102
We've got a lot
of new clout right now,

2189
02:16:51,206 --> 02:16:53,083
and we can run the table
on Khrushchev,

2190
02:16:53,187 --> 02:16:54,334
the Middle East,
and Southeast Asia.

2191
02:16:54,439 --> 02:16:56,211
Right. You're right.

2192
02:17:07,889 --> 02:17:09,870
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Anderson,

2193
02:17:11,226 --> 02:17:14,250
I was deeply shocked
when advised your son was lost

2194
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:16,752
in an operational mission
on Saturday,

2195
02:17:17,586 --> 02:17:20,297
<i>October 27, 1962.</i>

2196
02:17:22,174 --> 02:17:23,530
<i>Your son rendered distinguished</i>

2197
02:17:23,634 --> 02:17:25,824
<i>and dedicated service
to his country</i>

2198
02:17:25,859 --> 02:17:27,596
<i>throughout his career.</i>

2199
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:30,620
<i>He was admired...</i>

2200
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:32,705
<i>and respected</i>

2201
02:17:32,914 --> 02:17:34,165
<i>for his courage,</i>

2202
02:17:34,791 --> 02:17:37,710
<i>and his professional skill
by all with whom he served.</i>

2203
02:17:38,336 --> 02:17:40,838
<i>His tragic loss
will be deeply felt...</i>

2204
02:17:42,194 --> 02:17:45,009
<i>and a grateful nation
will be forever in his debt.</i>

2205
02:18:06,593 --> 02:18:07,531
Ken, we're out here.

2206
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:30,366
<i>What kind of a peace
do we seek?</i>

2207
02:18:30,783 --> 02:18:33,077
<i>I am talking about
genuine peace?/i>

2208
02:18:33,181 --> 02:18:36,622
<i>The kind of peace that makes
life on earth worth living?/i>

2209
02:18:36,727 --> 02:18:38,864
<i>Not merely peace in our time,</i>

2210
02:18:38,899 --> 02:18:41,002
<i>but peace in all time.</i>

2211
02:18:41,523 --> 02:18:43,782
<i>Our problems are man-made,</i>

2212
02:18:43,817 --> 02:18:46,528
<i>therefore,
they can be solved by man.</i>

2213
02:18:46,632 --> 02:18:48,874
<i>For in the final analysis,</i>

2214
02:18:48,909 --> 02:18:51,116
<i>our most basic common link</i>

2215
02:18:51,324 --> 02:18:53,305
<i>is that we all inhabit</i>

2216
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:55,287
<i>this small planet.</i>

2217
02:18:55,495 --> 02:18:57,789
<i>We all breathe the same air.</i>

2218
02:18:57,893 --> 02:19:00,500
<i>We all cherish
our children's future,</i>

2219
02:19:00,535 --> 02:19:02,690
<i>and we are all mortal.</i>
