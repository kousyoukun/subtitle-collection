00:53:17,216 --> 00:53:20,852
'Cause over the weekend I realised
what I really need is a "party" party,

777
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:23,888
a great big fuck-off house party,

778
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,061
featuring, say, a set by... a
young up-and-coming country singer,

779
00:53:28,696 --> 00:53:30,127
Rose-Lynn Harlan.

780
00:53:30,129 --> 00:53:32,229
What? You want me to play at your party?

781
00:53:32,231 --> 00:53:33,333
Yeah. Will you?

782
00:53:34,435 --> 00:53:37,069
- Well, aye, yeah, course I will.
- That is brilliant.

783
00:53:37,071 --> 00:53:38,870
That is not the exciting bit.

784
00:53:38,872 --> 00:53:42,006
The exciting bit is,
instead of bringing gifts,

785
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:46,647
people will contribute to a cause
that is very close to my heart... you.

786
00:53:46,979 --> 00:53:48,379
You perform a set.

787
00:53:48,381 --> 00:53:51,015
If people like what they
hear, which they will,

788
00:53:51,017 --> 00:53:53,118
then they invest in you, in your career.

789
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:58,026
That's, like, a hundred people
spending between £50 and £100.

790
00:53:58,392 --> 00:53:59,924
Voilà.

791
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:02,729
By the magic of
crowd-funding, you are there.

792
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,995
- Where?
- The Isle of Man.

793
00:54:04,997 --> 00:54:06,367
Nashville!

794
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:10,671
What, you're gonna tax your
pals to come to your house

795
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:12,738
for an audience with your daily woman?

796
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,105
Yeah.

797
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:17,111
- You've lost the plot, hen!
- [Susannah laughs]

798
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:21,912
- Oh, do you have a band?
- Aye, yeah, course I do.

799
00:54:21,914 --> 00:54:23,448
- When is it?
- Next Sunday.

800
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:26,220
You've already booked the week off,
and you can use that time to rehearse.

801
00:54:26,886 --> 00:54:31,423
Oh, no. No, I cannae do that week. But
it's cool, I don't need to rehearse.

802
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:33,325
I've been playing with
these guys since I was 14.

803
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:35,963
Rose-Lynn, you definitely
need to rehearse.

804
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:37,664
If you're asking people for money, if...

805
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:42,000
If you want people to buy in to the
idea that you're gonna make it out there,

806
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:45,173
then you need to put in a
really professional performance.

807
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:49,209
Oh, yeah, cool, yeah. Fucking-A.

808
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:51,475
Brilliant.

809
00:54:51,477 --> 00:54:52,780
Whoo!

810
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:55,415
[Susannah walks away]

811
00:54:57,818 --> 00:54:58,919
Well...

812
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:01,254
I cannae fault it.

813
00:55:01,821 --> 00:55:03,390
[both chuckle]

814
00:55:10,464 --> 00:55:11,799
Mum?

815
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,267
- Susannah's needing me in next week.
- She cannae have you.

816
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:18,136
Kids are on holiday. She can
do without you for a week.

817
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:19,638
You said you'd take them away.

818
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,511
Well, it's no', uh... it's no'
cleaning I'd be doing, it's rehearsing.

819
00:55:23,977 --> 00:55:25,843
I'm doing this gig at her house.

820
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:28,815
She's invited all these people
and I'm gonna perform with my band.

821
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:31,418
And then they're gonna invest.

822
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:33,855
Invest? Invest in what?

823
00:55:35,189 --> 00:55:37,425
In me, in my career,

824
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:40,091
in getting to Nashville.

825
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:41,162
Oh.

826
00:55:42,729 --> 00:55:46,497
I don't remember her investing in Mary
when she was in agony with her hip.

827
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:47,732
Eighteen-month waiting list.

828
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:50,167
If she'd money to spare, she
could have forked out on that.

829
00:55:50,169 --> 00:55:52,039
She isnae forking it out.

830
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:55,073
She's giving me a chance to earn it.

831
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:58,142
But it's got to be good, no pub band.
We havenae long to put it together.

832
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:01,145
I phoned the school to see about
holiday club, but it's all full up,

833
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:04,850
and I'd rather they were with you
'cause I don't want them thinking...

834
00:56:04,852 --> 00:56:05,950
Thinking what?

835
00:56:05,952 --> 00:56:08,319
That you cast them off
when you get a better offer?

836
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:12,026
Or that all this is for nothing 'cause
you've still got one foot out the door?

837
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:17,298
I cannae help you.

838
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:19,800
I havenae booked the time off.

839
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:22,803
You've been there 20 year.

840
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:27,339
- Special circumstances.
- I've used that enough.

841
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:29,010
Aye, when I was fucking up.

842
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:31,609
What's for you will no' go by you.

843
00:56:31,611 --> 00:56:33,611
This is me trying to
make something of myself.

844
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:36,013
Surely to God that's a good thing for them.

845
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:37,482
A good thing for them?

846
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:41,553
No' letting them down
again and again and again,

847
00:56:41,555 --> 00:56:43,591
that would be a good thing for them.

848
00:56:44,423 --> 00:56:46,293
And I thought you'd turned a corner.

849
00:56:46,593 --> 00:56:48,162
More fool me!

850
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:00,504
- [Wynonna] Where are we going?
- [Lyle] To the beach.

851
00:57:00,506 --> 00:57:04,345
We're going to go into the sea
and look at different jellyfish.

852
00:57:06,546 --> 00:57:09,116
Come on. That's a good boy. Come on.

853
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:12,520
Here we go.

854
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:17,189
Oh, in yous come.

855
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:19,124
[Lyle] I don't want to go in there!

856
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:21,593
Mary's gonna look after you
for a wee while this week, okay?

857
00:57:21,595 --> 00:57:24,999
I didn't say a week,
Rose-Lynn, I said today.

858

- [Mary] Oh, you're fine, you're fine.

Come on. Mum'll be back. You'll be fine.

When I first met Sam,

915
01:00:44,664 --> 01:00:48,334
we lived in this shittiest

There was nothing there,
not like it is now.

at the height of your powers.
