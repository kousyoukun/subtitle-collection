1
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,846
我的兒
Okay son...

2
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,357
我知道你想讓它結束。
I know you want it to end.

3
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,105
我就在這裏。
I'm right here.

4
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,496
我就在這裏...
I'll be right here...

5
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,108
但不要放棄。
But do not give up.

6
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,090
你聽到我的話了嗎？
Do you hear me?

7
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:52,652
雖然你仍然可以屏住呼吸，但他仍在戰鬥。
While you can still hold one breath, still he is fighting.

8
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,535
呼吸…保持呼吸。
Breathe... keep breathing.

9
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,808
霍克。
Hawk.

10
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,950
卡爾馬。
Calma.

11
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:33,990
tmd！
Oh fuck!

12
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:38,606
該死的混蛋。
Damn bastards.

13
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,859
只有我們收到了關於他的。
Only we received shit about him.

14
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,939
你看見庫爾特了嗎？ 不
- Have you seen Coulter? - No.

15
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,215
嗨，這些肉什麼時候能弄乾淨？
Listen, when meat is clean...

16
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,042
我要你收拾好。
I want you to pack up tight.

17
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,542
請記住，我們包裹裏獸皮不是15張…
Remember, we do not get 15 skins on the package...

18
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,714
每個包裹放30張。 菲茨傑拉德。
- Do 30 skins per package. - Fitzgerald.

19
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,073
船長。我們怎樣來進行？
- Captain. - How are we to carry?

20
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,687
你覺得呢？
What do you think?

21
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,859
額...
Well...

22
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,882
無論他們在哪裏，無論他們在那裏打獵…
Think wherever they are, whether they hunt there...

23
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:16,950
我不需要另一個獵人。
I will not need another shot.

24
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,857
我們要趕在黎明前。
Move us ensure dawn.

25
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,315
今天上午已經準備好了，
Would have been ready for this morning,

26
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,143
我已經準備好了，如果可以的話…
I'd gone already here if my...

27
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,767
你知道我們現在的處境非常的不安全。
You know that we are not in safe territory.

28
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,244
我想這將是一個難熬的一天。
I think it will be just a few days ahead to Strong.

29
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,628
他們肯定會緊張…
All they have to worry...

30
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:29,332
這是給孩子們準備新鮮的肉。如果,
- It is to give the children fresh meat. - If.

31
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,379
如果…你見到了庫爾特嗎？
If... Have you seen Coulter?

32
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:36,975
嘿，我們放倒了頭駝鹿。
Hey we lay down a moose.

33
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,445
超大的一頭。
a big one.

34
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,147
我需要你們去幫我們。
I need help to get him.

35
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,063
讓我猜猜什麼時候你們剝完了皮
Let me know when to remove the skin.

36
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,350
我到很樂意去幫忙拿過來
I'll be happy to help then.

37
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,941
不，別這樣...我需要你的幫助
No, come on... friends need your help.

38
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,709
我們需要休息一下…
We need to rest our butts packing...

39
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,617
弄了這麼多的肉…
Took so long eating this damn meat...

40
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,942
我都開始擔心我的妻子怎麼處理這些了。
As I begin to wonder like cooking my wife.

41
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,008
該死，我開始想你的妻子。
Hell, I begin to wonder your wife.

42
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:57,268
閉上你的臭嘴
Shut the hell.

43
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,255
救命-庫爾特…
- Help. - Coulter...

44
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,670
該死的.是庫爾特嗎？
- Fuck. - Is that Coulter?

45
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,086
呆在一起.吉姆，你去找船長。
- Stay together. - Jim, look for the Captain.

46
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,750
基督（祈禱上帝保佑）！
Jesus Christ!

47
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,249
-閉嘴！快來幫我！
- Shut up! - Help me!

48
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,454
安靜…-沉默的聲音…
- All tuned... - Hagan silence...

49
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:18,937
該死
Damn.

50
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,088
那是什麼？
What was that?

51
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,066


52
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,329
我們走
Let's go.

53
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,499
他們在那裏。
They are upon us.

54
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,489
我看不到他們
I can not see them.

55
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,509
-趴下，TMD
- Down. - Fuck.

56
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,629
他們到處都是。
they're Everywhere.

57
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,415
我們被包圍了
We are surrounded.

58
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,863
-他們到處都是…
- They are everywhere. - Soho...

59
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,361
呆在這兒
Stay here.

60
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,545
不,不,奧,我的天！
No, no, no. Oh no!

61
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,390
待在下面
Stay below.

62
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,625
沒有人能離開這…
Nobody leaves outdoors...

63
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,042
有人爬上了這座山！
What someone climb the hill!

64
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,637
沒有人動，留在這兒。
Nobody move, stay where you are.

65
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,211
他們想要獸皮
They want skins.

66
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,916
如果不是你現在急著收包…
If you do not collect the packages now...

67
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,048
我們現在什麼都沒有了
We will lose them all.

68
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,172
去上船。兒子，船。
Go to the boat. The boat, son.

69
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,674
走,走,走.
Move, move, move.

70
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,225
走出這林子，走…
Get out of the forest, leaving the forest...

71
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:29,383
去船那邊
Toward the boat.

72
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,974
霍克！
Hawk!

73
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,640
霍克,霍克.
Hawk, Hawk.

74
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,364
拿住那些獸皮.
Grab skins.

75
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,333
來，拿住獸皮。
Come on, grab the skin.

76
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,371
拿好獸皮.
Grab skins.

77
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,077
安.過來。
Agrrenlas. Come on.

78
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,462
過來
Come on.

79
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,061
堅持住，我們會得到幫助…
Hold on, we'll get help...

80
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,308
加油，繼續走…
Come on, keep moving...

81
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:39,812
格拉斯
Glass !

82
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,060
快上船
Go into the boat!

83
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,533
該死的孫子
fuck  son ..

84
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,294
起來，去船那邊.
Get up, toward the boat.

85
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,217
救命
Help.

86
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:25,537
走，跟上.
Move, come on.

87
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,238
快來
Come on.

88
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,831
-注意-切斷繩子.
- Care. - Cut the rope.

89
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:34,414
把繩索切掉.
Cut the rope.

90
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,137
我要去下游.
I going downstream.

91
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,305
快上船.
Get in the boat.

92
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,350
求你們，別走，等等我.
Do not go, please.

93
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,473
我的女兒,頗瓦恰，他不在這兒.（這裏伏筆--待會劇情之找女兒）
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

94
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:43,254
快拿上我們所以能帶得動的獸皮.
Gather all the skins we can load.

95
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:47,915
這些獸皮能讓我們換到法國種馬...
Will change the skins with the French horse...

96
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,957
快繼續找.
And we continue searching.

97
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:55,623
塵埃還花…
And the dust returns flowers...

98
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:56,585
阿門
Amen.

99
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,423
當晨星在東方出現，爭鬥就結束了，我的心智就像黎明那般清淨...
When the morning was clear...

100
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,460
阿門
Amen.

101
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:18,698
準備好了嗎？
Ready?

102
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,689
別動
Do not move.

103
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,215
你從哪而學會的這本事？
Where did you learn that?

104
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,291
我的父親是一名醫生.
My father was a doctor.

105
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:34,571
-布裏傑.-船長有一小隊人馬跟著我們…
- Bridger. - Captain have a small group following us...

106
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:36,037
希望這次能完成這次交易。
Hoping to finish the job.

107
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,326
-按住這兒.-如果
- Hold there. - If.

108
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,859
告訴我你有什麼計劃。
Tell me you have some sort of plan.

109
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,522
格拉斯
Glass.

110
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,390
密蘇里的身體狀況不太好。
The Missouri is not good.

111
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,900
它還有口氣在。
There is still water running in it.

112
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,586
我們必須離開這條船…
We must get off this boat...

113
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,236
你想讓我們下船嗎？
Do you want to get off the boat?

114
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,677
我們應該怎麼辦？
What shall we do?

115
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,787
獸皮...
skins...

116
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,611
我們坐在那裏，像一群該死的狗。
And we sat there on the tail, like a bunch of damn dogs.

117
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,142
最穩妥的辦法是想到一個新的安排…
The safest thing to do is charting a new course...

118
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,277
我們走陸路
Back to earth.

119
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,591
對於這次「旅程」做好準備
Prepare the trip.

120
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,871
最好現在我們正在下沉，被那些白癡抓住。
Best sinking now, being caught those idiots.

121
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,109
他們現在正在盯著你呢，「乖兒子」.
Already they have eyes on you right now, son.

122
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:20,045
我想說的是我們現在被他們盯上了.
I say follow in the pot.

123
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,761
把船靠向岸邊…
Put the course heading to Fort...

124
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,639
和走水路一樣有風險。
And risk for water.

125
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,384
格拉斯比我們所有人都瞭解怎麼走.
Glass territory knows this better than the rest of us together.

126
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,192
你的任務是帶著我們安全的回去.
Your job is to bring them safely home.

127
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,572
-讓他待我們安全的回去？-呵呵
- Take me home safely? - If.

128
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,036
我必須提醒你，我們已經失去了32個人.
Do I have to remind you that we lost 32 men ?

129
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
第33個也快了.
33 already.

130
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,481
他們都是好樣的,菲茨傑拉德，不論多少損失。
They were my men Fitzgerald, is how many lost.

131
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,028
我們按照格拉斯說的做，服從命令.
We do what he says Glass, order this.

132
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,165
我們必須放棄水路.
We must release the boat.

133
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,466
如果我們繼續這麼走下去，這hallaran河就是我們的盡頭。
If we track, which Hallaran the end of the river.

134
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,744
最好的方案是沿著斯卡拉走
The best course is scalar field...

135
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,481
去Fort Kahowa（地名）.
To Fort Kahowa.

136
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:03,638
-好吧.-這樣的路線安全嗎？
- Come on. - Insurance?

137
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:05,805
我一周前去過那裏。
A week before arriving there.

138
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,353
至少我們要一些馬匹。
At least something to change horses.

139
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:09,908
我到知道有一個地方你可以得到。
I know of no place where you can do that.

140
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,384
瞭解，船長.
Well, Captain.

141
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,900
放棄這艘船，這是個TMD決定。
Losing the boat, it is a fucking mistake.

142
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,989
印第安人也不愚蠢…
Besides the Red Indians are not stupid...

143
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:18,793
如果我們堅持下去，我們就可以穿過山峰。
If we keep it, we can down across the peaks.

144
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,879
你的行為就像你所說的,菲茨傑拉德。
You act like you know what you're talking of Fitzgerald.

145
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,076
你根本沒法交流
No one is talking to you.

146
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,031
根本不聽建議.
Do not listen anyway.

147
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:27,565
我不相信但我不得不必須忍受這該死的…
I can not believe I have to endure this shit ...

148
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:28,589
我說...
All I say...

149
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:30,720
這是一種方式...
Camp there is a way...

150
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:32,392
但我們會死在這兒.
And we can hang in there.

151
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:34,536
我們走陸路.
We walked.

152
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,120
好吧，你是老大聽你的.
Yeah, sure we will.

153
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,522
我不大相信他，因為我都不知道他是做什麼的.
Demons can not believe I do not know his work captain.

154
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:43,988


155
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,956
把獸皮藏在岩石中直到我們回來…
Hide packaging in the rocks when we return...

156
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,966
-記住.一定要在藏得地方做上記號。
- Pick. - Be sure to mark the place.

157
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,314
我們為這些岩石留下了一筆財富。
We left a fortune on these rocks.

158
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,490
這裏沒有更多的地方可以放置，我們就搬到山上。
No more room here, we move to the hills .

159
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,538
格拉斯.
Glass. Charts a course...

160
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:57,880
狹窄的路可能會把我們帶到小溪旁。
The narrower may bring us near the stream.

161
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,904
是的
Yes, sir.

162
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:03,769
那不是對的
This is not right.

163
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,538
都知道，當我們返回時這些獸皮還能不能在。
All know that this forest will not here when we return.

164
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,359
我們沒辦法一直帶著這些獸皮
There is no way we can take them all the way ...

165
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,261
返回到城堡。
Back to the Fort.

166
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:12,309
我們必須這麼做…雖然存在很大的風險…
Not the way we go, well... It's a big risk...

167
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,715
我們將在它的領土上，希望你的雙手自由。
We will be in its territory 'll want your hands free.

168
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,493
我試著告訴他不要丟掉這些皮。
I try to tell him not lose these skins.

169
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,290
你想要和這些獸皮待在一起還是活著？
You want to stay with skins or your life?

170
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,314
生活？
Life?

171
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,038
這是什麼生活？我都快沒命了.
What life is this? I have no life.

172
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,625
我擁有的僅僅是自由和獲得這些獸皮而已.
I have just as freedom and get is with these skins.

173
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:28,624
TMD
Fuck!

174
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,341


175
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:33,811
不管如何,我都得回去...
No way, I'm going home...

176
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:36,519
我們一直忙了快六個月了，我累的就像頭騾子
I've been six months breaking my back as mule

177
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,250
伸著自己的脖子...
Risking my neck...

178
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:40,015
死了的話
Men dying and why?

179
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,700
即等於失去了一切。
Almost lost everything.

180
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,439
這份活計從一開始就很操蛋.
The work was fucked from the start.

181
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,454
我們都會沒事的.
We are well screwed.

182
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:50,866
你們想離開這裏…
And you guys want to leave it here...

183
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,031
因為格拉斯先生在這兒
Because Mr Glass here

184
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,208
能解決掉這麻煩
Is supposed to fix the damn things.

185
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:58,509
-因為他知道很多山路.-遠遠超過我們所知道的.
- Because he knows a lot of hills. - Much more than we know.

186
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,397
是吧？
Yes?

187
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,424


188
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,213
帶著他的兒子…
Brought his son...

189
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:07,519
我說他看起來像個野人
And it looks like a wild, if you ask me.

190
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,971
讓他的兒子一個人.
Leaves his son alone.

191
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,458
我就說說.
I'm just saying.

192
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,589
野人…他們是野蠻人…
Wild... They are savages...

193
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:23,865
嗨，格拉斯
Hey Glass.

194
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,470
他們說的是真的嗎？射中了一位中尉…
Is it true what they say? That shot a Lieutenant...

195
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,214
然後他生活在野蠻人中嗎？
While living among savages?

196
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,319
菲茨傑拉德。
Fitzgerald.

197
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,360
死光了士兵和21人在印第安人…
Soldiers dead and 21 others in Indian...

198
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:39,474
但你和你的兒子是唯一活著的人。
But you and your son were the only ones walk out alive.

199
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,491
這就像是一個奇跡，不是嗎？
It's like a miracle, is not it?

200
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:42,974
閉嘴,菲茨傑拉德。
Shut Fitzgerald.

201
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,151
是那樣的嗎？
Is that you?

202
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,766
射擊你的同伴去救這只像狗一樣的兒子？
Shoot one of your own to save this dog here?

203
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,313
-閉嘴。你想打孩子嗎？
- Shut up. - You want to fight child?

204
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,821
你和那個男孩的媽媽**嗎？
You were playing with the boy's mother?

205
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,887
-菲茨傑拉德！-他殺死了她？
- Fitzgerald! - He killed her?

206
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,730
你可以不在擦這槍了嗎？我正在跟你說話呢
You can end the rifle, I'm talking about.

207
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:00,738
我正在工作。
I'm working on it.

208
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,562
當我在跟你說話的時候，你就這樣做了。
You do it when you finish after talking to you.

209
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,987
-看著人渣.-這已經足夠！
- Look slag. - It's enough!

210
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,352
忘了你的孩子。
You forget your kid place.

211
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:14,954
據我所處的地方，這是一支槍。
As far as my place is here, this side rifle.

212
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,055
走開,菲茨傑拉德.
Move Fitzgerald.

213
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,278


214
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:21,876
聽我說
Listen to me.

215
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,995
現在只有幾個小時的時間留給我們.
We only have a few hours left us light.

216
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,123
我們必須藏好這些獸皮...
We must keep these skins...

217
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,664
並且擺脫船，快點.
And get rid of the boat, come on.

218
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,906
是的,船長.
Yes, Captain.

219
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:32,291
我說過你是看不出來的，孩子。
I told you were invisible, son.

220
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,186
-至少…如果你還想活著…
- At least... - If you want to keep closed survive...

221
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
河口【地名】
Mouth.

222
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:40,709
-至少他聽到了我…他們沒有聽到你的聲音！
- At least he heard me... - They do not hear your voice!

223
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,803
只看你皮膚的顏色。
Only see the color of your skin.

224
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:44,862
你明白嗎？
Do you understand?

225
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,234
你懂了嗎？-是的
- Do you understand? - Yes

226
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,080
你必須聽我的，兒子.
You must listen to me, son.

227
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:56,383
你不得不聽.
You have to listen.

228
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:10,892
貝克特.
Beckett.

229
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,462
韋斯頓。
Weston.

230
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,181
為什麼不跳呢？
Why not jump?

231
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,838
看起來我們似乎擺脫了他們。
It seems that changed their minds.

232
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,893
「聰明」的混蛋。
Clever bastards.

233
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,158
不錯…
Astute ...

234
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,626
確實該捨棄那條船。
Should be on that boat.

235
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,930
你是對的
You did right.

236
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:00,312
是時候出發了
It's time to move.

237
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,501
該起了.
Rise.

238
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,780
我們得走了.
Let's go.

239
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,106
我馬上來.
I'm coming.

240
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,368
你先躺著吧.
Best lie down.

241
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:18,955
當其他人準備好，我來叫你。
When other men are ready, send them to me.

242
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,355
我去西方.
I go to the West.

243
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,418
你是我的兒子
You're my son.

244
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,580
你是我的兒子
You're my son.

245
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,478
這兒只有兩個.
There are only two here.

246
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,178
頗瓦恰不在這兒
Powaqa is not here

247
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,804
可能別人帶走了她.
The others probably took her.

248
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,548
他們去了北邊.
They went north.

249
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:09,777
我們將翻越這些山。
We'll take the trail in the mountains.

250
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,192
這是正確的決定嗎？
Was it the right decision...?

251
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,605
丟下船走陸路?
Leave the boat?

252
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,169
我們不能繼續沿著這條河。
We could not continue down the river.

253
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,168
字幕
We had flanked.

254
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:28,092
如果我們繼續在地面上，山…
If we continue east on ground, mountains...

255
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,005
我們將節省一周的時間返回到家。
We saved a week to the Fort.

256
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,351
如果我們不改變任何路線的話。
That if we do not change anything on the way.

257
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,239
-你覺得呢
- Do you think you? - If.

258
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,839
菲茨傑拉德說的是真的嗎？
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?

259
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,879
你來這兒是為了逃避法律的制裁？
What you came here running from the law?

260
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,836
格拉斯,保持冷靜
Glass, just keep quiet.

261
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,179
你的兒子，看到了很多…
Your boy, has seen much...

262
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,726
你覺得有像母親的權利嗎？
Do you have a mother reunite the Right Thing?

263
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,686
他在這兒
There's something here.

264
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,757
格拉斯
Glass !

265
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,647
他在這兒
We have something here.

266
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,529
我的上帝
Christ almighty.

267
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,201
嗨,你
Hey, you.

268
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:24,002
嗨
Hey!

269
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:25,593
他在下面
It is below.

270
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,329
-快來幫我...-睜大你的眼睛
- Help me... - Keep your eyes open.

271
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:31,072
快來,我需要幫助.
Come on, I need help now.

272
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,279
格拉斯
Glass.

273
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,968
我的上帝
Oh my God!

274
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,349
-奧，基督-船長
- Oh Christ! - Captain.

275
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:40,813
給我破布!
Rags need now!

276
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,056
給我布堵住傷口
Press with rags where blood flows.

277
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,995
這兒
Prepare things.

278
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,212
布裏傑，吸起來。
Bridger, suck it up.

279
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,834
-安靜-我的天！
- Quiet. - God!

280
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,936
你不得不信他殺了那頭灰熊。
You have to give him credit for that Grizzly carried with him.

281
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,886
應該是射死的，整個地方都充滿了樹…
Should shoot, the whole place is full of trees damn...

282
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,097
那足夠了！
That's enough!

283
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,679
我們還在他們的領土上…
Continue in their territories...

284
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,642
他是一個像惡魔一樣的男人。
It is one of our men, demons.

285
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:07,174

船長，沒有意義的…

Fuck Captain, were 45 men when we started, now 10, almost 9

430
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,305
你是我的父親願意和你分享
You Are my father can have my share.

431
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,426
我也是
Mine too.

432
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,714
我的一部分。
My part as well.

433
00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,633
好吧
Okay.

434
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:03,485
很好，如果布拉傑先生覺得，那我就呆在這兒.
Well, if Mr. Bridger feels the same way, I'll stay.

435
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:04,573
-你？-如果
- You? - If.

436
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,196
我已經丟掉了我的獸皮的收益...
I've lost my share of skins...

437
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,928
所以我不得不找一些額外的收入
So I have no choice but to look for other income .

438
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:13,874
所以多呆在這兒一兩天也不會有什麼不同
Also be here a day or two most not make a difference.

439
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,697
200美元，帶著他回家
$ 200, is bringing something go home.

440
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,660
你需要照顧好格拉斯直到結束.
You need to take care Glass until the time comes.

441
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:19,684
明白了嗎？
Understand?

442
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,599
是的，先生，你知道我的
Si. Yes, you have my word.

443
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:27,193
先生們，趕在天黑之前把他放在安全的地方吧
Guys, Lower him to some safer place before nightfall.

444
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:28,607
字幕
Already they have heard guys.

445
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:29,986
-菲茨傑拉德。隊長。
- Fitzgerald. - Captain.

446
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:34,152
你必須照顧好格拉斯.
Glass must be careful much time as needed.

447
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,607
當死神來臨的時候，給他一個適當的埋葬。
Y a proper burial when the time comes. He earned.

448
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,309
我懂得
Understood.

449
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,950
父親，你能聽到風嗎？
Can you hear the wind, Father?

450
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:07,282
你還記得我媽媽過去常常說的什麼嗎？
Do you remember what my mother used to say wind?

451
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:15,793
風不可能吹倒一棵有根的樹。
Wind can not beat a tree with strong roots.

452
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,685
保持呼吸...
Still breathe...

453
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,129
我非常的想念她
I miss her so much.

454
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:51,920
我就在這裏…
I'll be right here...

455
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,233
我就在這裏…
I'm right here.

456
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,511
雖然你仍然可以屏住呼吸，但他仍在戰鬥。
While you can still hold one breath, still he is fighting.

457
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:09,918
吸氣，保持呼吸.
Breathe. Keep breathing.

458
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:13,759
當暴風雪來臨的時候…
When a storm...

459
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:21,960
你正站在一棵樹的前面…
And you're standing in front of a tree...

460
00:41:26,238 --> 00:41:33,289
如果你看見樹枝要墜落…
If you see the branches swear to be falling...

461
00:41:43,423 --> 00:41:51,360
但是如果你看到了樹幹，你會注意到它很穩定。
But if you see the trunk, you notice stability.

462
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,186
300美元是不可忽視的…
$ 300 is something not negligible...

463
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:39,633
我會去德克薩斯，我買一塊像樣的土地…
I will go to Texas, I buy a decent piece of land ...

464
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,354
我去如廁。
And I will begin to urinate into the wild.

465
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,042
我離開這個鬼地方。
I leave this godforsaken place.

466
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:51,200
你這樣做嗎？
The Reds you do that?

467
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,401
只是想知道。
Just wondering.

468
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:57,021
他們做了。
They did.

469
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,375
他們生活好了之後就搬進了城市
They took the city in which he was well.

470
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,909
一開始我就一無所有，
At the beginning I felt nothing,

471
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,650
只聽到聲音…
Only hear the sound...

472
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,253
刀刮我的頭骨，你知道…
Knife scraping my skull, you know...

473
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,738
他們笑著，喊著，砰的一聲…
They laughed and shouted and banged...

474
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,082
然後是血…
Then came the blood ...

475
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,040
寒冷開始侵襲我的臉和我的眼睛…
Cold started running down my face and my eyes...

476
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:20,369
呼吸…
The breathing...

477
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,290
我差點被淹死了。
I was drowning in it.

478
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,764
那是當我感覺到它。
That's when I felt it.

479
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:28,107
感覺到任何事
I felt everything.

480
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:31,434
我把我的頭向後靠。
Toned I had my head backwards.

481
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:33,955
耶穌
Jesus.

482
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:36,050
是的，所以我要去德克薩斯…
Yes, so I'm going to Texas...

483
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,553
搶你，卻不拿你的頭。
Rob you, but do not take your head.

484
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:41,858
它是怎樣的？
How was it?

485
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:48,890
你能停止噪音嗎？
Could you please stop that noise?

486
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:51,226
我想說的是...丟掉它
I just... Leave it.

487
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:21,550
那些不能幫助你的人。
I'm full of skin and with guys who can not help you.

488
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:28,911
我們爬上了山，所以他們就不會再繼續追了。
We climb the mountains damn so that we do not continue chasing.

489
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,535
如果你準備好了…
If you are ready...

490
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,337
享受這聖餐。
Take the sacrament.

491
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,047
我可以為你做。
I can do for you.

492
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,582
格拉斯你知道什麼
What you cling Glass?

493
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:50,655
你想知道？
You know?

494
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,859
這將變得更好...
It would be better...

495
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:56,106
如果你給了那最後的呼吸。
If you gave that last breath now.

496
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:57,869
為了我們
For all of us.

497
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,541


498
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,050
一些事
That's something.

499
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,931
我懇求你格拉斯，
I beg Glass,

500
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,469
印第安人離我們很近，我甚至可以問到他們...
Reds are so close I can smell them now...

501
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:11,645
並且我知道你也可以，所以你不得不去考慮
And I know that you can smell them, and you have to think.

502
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,092
為你自己，和你的孩子.
Think of your boy.

503
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:15,846
很好，因為你將要殺了他。
Good, because you're going to kill him.

504
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,534
我們將殺了他們.
We will kill them all.

505
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,764
如果你想要的話我可以幫助你。
I can help if you want.

506
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:29,744
釋放痛苦非常快速和容易的…
Quitarte suffering very fast and easy...

507
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,845
我想誰也不知道是你放棄了他。
Nobody has to know that you gave up. I would.

508
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,269
你所要做的只是眨一下眼鏡…
All you have to do is blink...

509
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:36,552
如果你想讓我這樣做的話。
If you want me to do that.

510
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,931
救你的兒子和眨一下眼睛
Save your guy and flashes.

511
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:56,892
可以的話你就眨下眼。
Just blink.

512
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,362
好的
yeahi.

513
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,452
奧，好的
Oh, yes!

514
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:08,276
願上帝保佑你.
Hopefully the good Lord, us out of here soon.

515
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:14,900
也許原諒你的罪過，你知道，也許不是…
May forgive your sins, you know, maybe not...

516
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,091
你必須向主投降。
You must surrender to the Lord.

517
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:22,391
在基督裏，主憐憫…
In Jesus Christ, the Lord have mercy...

518
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:29,095
別動，滾開。
Stay away. Get away.

519
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:32,651
你還好嗎？吉姆。吉姆…幫助。
Are you okay? Jim. Jim... Help.

520
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,915
-幫助。平靜。好了，不要喊。
- Help. - Calm. Well, do not shout.

521
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,702
-不要尖叫，你這樣會殺死我們。讓我們走。
- Do not scream, you want to kill us. - Let go.

522
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:54,535
我會告訴你你做了什麼，你會死的.
I'll tell you what you did and you will hang.

523
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,012
-你必須明白…
- You have to understand that... - You hang, quotes...

524
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,527
Help. 吉姆快來。
Help. Jim come here.

525
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,606
睡吧孩子…
Silence guy...

526
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,266
TMD
Fuck.

527
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:19,826
你得生點火來做食餵他
You have to feed the fire.

528
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:23,562
他的呼吸變了。
His breathing changed.

529
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,810
注意。
Noticed.

530
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:30,193
我的天，他冷得像冰一樣。
Hell, is cold as ice.

531
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:35,130
這兒，格拉斯先生...抬起頭
Here Mr. Glass... This head...

532
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,154
這將使你感到溫暖
Will keep you warm.

533
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:39,094
好的
Okay.

534
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,185
霍克在哪裏？
Where is Hawk?

535
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,203
他不是和你在一起嗎？
Was not he with you?

536
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:48,492
沒有.-沒有？
- No. - No?

537
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,762
我懂，格拉斯先生
I understand Mr. Glass.

538
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
很好
Good.

539
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,728
我想我會去看看我是否能找到。
I think I'll go see if I can find .

540
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,787
是的，這聽起來是個好主意。
Yes, it sounds like a good idea.

541
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:09,768
霍克
Hawk!

542
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:13,193
…你殺了我的兒子。
... You killed my son.

543
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:14,217
霍克
Hawk!

544
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:40,301
布拉傑，有大約20個人沿著河流走
Bridge, there are about 20 Reds for the stream.

545
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,285
到這兒來。
Come over here.

546
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,387
收拾你的東西，讓我們走。
Pick up your shit and let's go.

547
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:48,580
TMD,等等，我們該怎麼做？
Fuck. Wait. What do we do?

548
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:50,421
快跑，馬上.
Running, now.

549
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:53,494
-霍克怎麼辦？-這已不再是我們的問題。
- And what about Hawk? - It is no longer our problem.

550
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:55,635
我們不能離開這裏。
We can not leave here.

551
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,434
他應該是在找我們
He is supposed browser.

552
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,749
他會找到它嗎？
Will she find it?

553
00:49:59,784 --> 00:50:01,469
等等，格拉斯怎麼辦？
Wait. What about Glass?

554
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:04,170
我們現在有更大的麻煩，還有他的兒子
We have more problems than he, is now on his own.

555
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:07,192
不，不，我們發過誓的，要帶他離開…
No, no, we made a promise Captain...

556
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:08,797
你必須給他一個適當的葬禮當時候到來。
You have to give him a proper burial when the time comes.

557
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:10,141
你需要一支槍。
Well you need a rifle.

558
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,064
你不能做任何事情，你不能用你的手。
You can not do anything with one, you can not use your hands.

559
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:14,859


560
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:16,251
不，不，我們不能這樣做。
No, no, we can not do this.

561
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:19,806
-我們別無選擇。-我們不能.看。
- We have no fucking choice. - We can not. Look.

562
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,502
-好，葬禮…-你在幹什麼？
- Well, a funeral... - What are you doing?

563
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,112
你想要帶著他？來吧。
Do you want to take? Come on.

564
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,524
不，等等...
No, wait...

565
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,247
冷靜，聽著……
Calma, Fitz slowly...

566
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,404
冷靜
Calma.

567
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,029
-我不能…-該死…
- I can not... - Damn...

568
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:38,998
倒霉
Shit.

569
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:40,326
等等，等等
Wait, wait...

570
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:41,361
等等
Wait!

571
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:46,645
閉嘴
Shut up.

572
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:48,385
等等
Wait.

573
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:52,567
菲茨...
Fitz...

574
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,680
你在幹什麼？
what are you doing? - Like what do I do?

575
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:56,616
一個適當的埋葬。
A proper burial.

576
00:50:56,706 --> 00:50:57,706
像承諾的那樣。
As promised.

577
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:00,337
-不，不。-為什麼不呢？
- No, not so. - Why not?

578
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,390
格拉斯仍然活著。它活著。
Glass is still alive. Its alive.

579
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:07,786
那就槍殺了他。
so shoot him.

580
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:22,742
我們不得不走了
I have to go.

581
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,131
抱歉
Sorry.

582
00:51:27,303 --> 00:51:28,558
抱歉，抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

583
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:45,434
船長，在這裏…
Captain, over here...

584
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,684
這下面有一條路。
There is a path below.

585
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,815
沒辦法通過經過。
No way to pass down here.

586
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,322
船長，我們必須爬過去
Captain, we must climb.

587
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:57,117
-穿過去的時候當心點。我們可能會掉下去.
- Cross over carefully. - O may all go to hell.

588
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,082
-地圖上說什麼？-繼續攀登。
- What does the map say? - Keep climbing.

589
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,602
爬上去，船長。
Climbed Captain.

590
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:04,473
我們繼續攀登。
We continue climbing.

591
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,225
直到我們到家。
Until we reach Fort.

592
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:11,679
跟上
Come on.

593
00:52:13,606 --> 00:52:14,869
-我們必須離開這裏-如果。是的
- We must get out of here. - yeah.

594
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:16,522
我們已經快接近了。
We are already closer.

595
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:18,919
船長
Captain.

596
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:25,200
主…讓我把他們帶回去吧。
Lord... Let me take this.

597
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,352
跟誰？
Who I follow?

598
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:28,858
跟隨你想要跟著的人。
Follow whoever you want.

599
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:30,059
我得到。
I gain.

600
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:35,222
布萊爾，來這兒！
Blair, come here!

601
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:01,674
我不會離開你的，我的兒.
I will not leave you, son.

602
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,830
我在這兒
I'm right here.

603
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:12,968
這火焰即將燃燒殆盡.
The fire is finished.

604
00:57:14,629 --> 00:57:16,136
別睡了...
Should not rest...

605
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,476
我們必須保持印第安人和我們之間的距離。
We must also put distance between the Reds and us.

606
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,309
好的
Well

607
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:24,667
印第安人不可能和我們一樣快
A dozen Reds may not be as fast as us.

608
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,234
-20.什麼？
- 20. - What?

609
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:30,564
我想說昨天你說你看到了20個印第安人
I thought you said you saw a 20 Reds.

610
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:32,166
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

611
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,787
你把我叫醒了。
you woke me up。

612
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:40,631
你說你在小溪下看到了20個印第安人。
You said you saw 20 Reds down the stream.

613
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:44,013
20或十幾，沒有問題…
If 20 or a dozen, no matter...

614
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,505
不打算告訴你留下來…
Not going to tell you to stay...

615
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,300
他們穿過了河，對嗎？
Their cursed pens in the river, right?

616
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,770
菲茨傑拉德。
Fitzgerald.

617
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:56,178
當時你在河邊幹什麼？
What were you doing by the river by yourself?

618
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,239
那時我們已經有足夠的水了。
We already had plenty of water.

619
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:02,366
嗨
Hey!

620
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:05,673
菲茨傑拉德回答我，我在問你話呢
Fitzgerald Answer me, I asked you a question.

621
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:10,127
不要去問那些不重要的事情…
Do not go questioning by things that are not important...

622
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:12,704
回答我，否則我會打爆你的頭。
Answer me or I'll blow your fucking head.

623
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:14,540
你可以射任何人
You can shoot everybody.

624
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,958
你現在還是會死在水裏了
You'd still be back sunk in the water right now...

625
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:19,116
如果不是我
If it was not for me.

626
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,948
我不會回答這個問題
I do not answer questions...

627
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:25,420
你不需要知道你在問什麼
You do not want to know what you're asking.

628
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:30,457
你想要知道為什麼丟下格拉斯讓他去死？
You want to know why you left Glass back to die?

629
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,246
也許
Maybe...

630
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:37,354
如果你不是一個小男孩你就不會知道他不可能活更久了
If you were not a little boy 'd know he was no longer alive.

631
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:39,836
我撒了謊，因為你還不是一個男人。
I tell lies because you're not a man.

632
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,498
是嗎？因為你害怕死亡...
Yes? Because you were afraid of death...

633
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:44,082
並且現在還在害怕，放下槍
And afraid now, lowers the rifle.

634
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,071
-印第安人。-怎麼回事？
- The Reds. - What about it?

635
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,740
告訴我你說的哪句是真的
Tell me now and honest in what you say.

636
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:51,484
-放下槍.-你看到了印第安人了嗎？
- Lower your rifle now. - You saw the Reds?

637
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,063
不
No.

638
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:57,815
一個都沒有
Neither one.

639
00:59:00,755 --> 00:59:02,189
你居然騙我？
You lied to me?

640
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:03,958
我欺騙了我
you lied me.

641
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:10,314
我不得不選擇正確的方式
I had to get into right guy.

642
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:13,404
從現在開始，不再談論什麼…
From now on, no talk more about...

643
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,723
別再說什麼了…懂嗎？
Do not no point in what is already done... Understand?

644
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:18,741


645
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,313
現在是在上帝的手中…
Is now in God's hands...

646
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:24,654
神所賜的，是神所賜的。
And what God gives, God takes.

647
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,930
倒霉
Shit.

648
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,367
起來，跟上。
Get up, come on.

649
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:36,728
下一次，如果你還想要射擊某人...
Next time, if you want to shoot someone...

650
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:39,780
最好使用你自己的
Better than you use... Better use powder...

651
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,527
改進你的步槍。
Improve your rifle.

652
00:59:44,738 --> 00:59:45,738
快
Come on...

653
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:48,492
跟上，快。
Follow. Come on.

654
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:52,592
真血。頗瓦恰。
True Blood. Could Powaqa.

655
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,443
一個死掉了小男孩
A dead boy.

656
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:16,839
一個男孩波尼。
A boy Pawnee.

657
01:04:17,837 --> 01:04:18,909
我們走
Let's go.

658
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:34,515
繼續向前
Go ahead.

659
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:30,546
-誰做的？我不知道。
- Who did this? - I do not know.

660
01:14:38,783 --> 01:14:41,146


661
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:44,746


662
01:14:45,808 --> 01:14:47,757
他們在這裏留下了一些東西。
They put some order around here.

663
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:54,143
這些印第安人從來沒有像你想像的那樣死去。
These Indians are never as dead as you think.

664
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:58,608
看看他們，總是像臭狗屎。
Look at them, always reek of shit.

665
01:15:35,682 --> 01:15:37,084
這裏有馬。
We have horses here.

666
01:15:41,843 --> 01:15:42,954
快
Come on.

667
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:49,818
馬

668

我們的抓住他們...

孩子你去另一邊抓他們。
Go into the side kid.

670
01:16:15,874 --> 01:16:16,914
你在想你死去的兒子？

671
01:16:17,758 --> 01:16:18,957
你在合適的的地方。
You are in the right place.

672
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,139
我想。
I guess.

673
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:29,014
-如果我們不可能幫助…-不
- Can not help thinking if we... - No.

674
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,182
沒有地方可以問。
No place to ask.

675
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,450
上帝為我們指引了道路，他們沒有選擇。
The good Lord puts us in the way, they have not chosen.

676
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,420
我爸爸是個虔誠教徒，你知道嗎？
My dad you were a religious man, you know?

677
01:16:41,935 --> 01:16:44,033
我可以做它，殺死它或吃它…
I could do grow it, kill it or eat it...

678
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:46,537
無論他做任何事我都無條件的相信
And just he made it without believing and nothing was it.

679
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:50,855
有一次他去打獵。
And once he went hunting Hills.

680
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:52,402
打獵
Hunting Hills...

681
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:56,848
他遇到了一些過去和他一起打獵的朋友.
He met some friends Texans and went hunting.

682
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,572
在這之前他已經有了幾百次的經驗
It was routine had done hundreds of times before.

683
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:05,603
三天的屠殺，TMD但在星期六結束了…

684
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:08,548
不知怎的在夜裏失去了他的朋友…

685
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,890
和所有的一切
And apart from all...

686
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:13,327
印第安人偷了他們的馬
Comanches stole them horses...

687
01:17:13,704 --> 01:17:15,111
我餓了

688
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,405


689
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,611
他爬進泥裏…
And he crawled in the mud...

690
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:23,158
在一組樹中間…
In a group of trees in the middle of nowhere...

691
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:25,771
我進入了那該死的「海洋」…
I got into that ocean of shit...

692
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,568
並且在那裏他找到了信仰。
And there he found religion.

693
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,218
一直
At that time...

694
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:31,336
他說...
He said...

695
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,206
他見到了上帝.
He found God.

696
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:42,100
它...

697
01:17:42,393 --> 01:17:43,561
「上帝"...

698
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:46,298
是一隻松鼠。
Was a squirrel.

699
01:17:47,617 --> 01:17:49,797
是的，他曾經見過他

700
01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:55,111
他就說我發現
了上帝I found God, he would say.

701
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,759
他坐在那裏聊天…
He sat and talked...

702
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:01,129
他光榮與崇高的虔誠…
His glory and sublime piety...

703
01:18:02,953 --> 01:18:05,088
但是我槍殺了個混蛋…
And I shot the motherfucker...

704
01:18:19,148 --> 01:18:21,128
威爾，睡覺吧

705
01:27:06,312 --> 01:27:08,918
我受傷了。
I'm hurt.

706
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:11,095
你遇到了什麼事？
What happened to you?

707
01:27:14,012 --> 01:27:17,430
一隻灰熊

我的朋友…他們丟下了我。

並殺了我的兒子

蘇人殺了我的人。
The Sioux killed my people.

713
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:06,780
我要去南方找更多的人。
I go south to find more Pawnee.

714
01:28:09,067 --> 01:28:10,770
我的心在流血…
My heart bleeds...

715
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:16,945
但復仇是在造物主的手中。
But revenge is in the hands of the creator.

716
01:28:25,765 --> 01:28:26,957
我帶著你一起
Will travel with me...

717
01:29:35,062 --> 01:29:36,478
你的身體都快爛了。
Your body is rotten.

718
01:29:37,881 --> 01:29:39,184
你需要趕快處理
You need to heal.

719
01:29:44,914 --> 01:29:45,998
不然的話你可能會死掉
You could die.

720
01:30:01,052 --> 01:30:02,141
是的
Yes!

721
01:30:02,227 --> 01:30:03,913
這兒
There.

722
01:30:05,653 --> 01:30:06,847
我們造的
We made it.

723
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,342
你應該為我們感到自豪孩子
You should be proud of you boy.

724
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,390
是
Si.

725
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:15,735
我們服從命令…只是省略了葬禮的一部分。
Follow orders... Just omit the part of the funeral.

726
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:19,581
不要再問一些關於良心的問題，好嗎？
Do not go down there with problems of conscience, right?

727
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:23,039


728
01:30:24,131 --> 01:30:26,050
現在，我們得做我們應該做的
Now, we did what we had to do.

729
01:30:54,692 --> 01:30:57,406
我們會拿出一天時間，所以深入挖掘…
We had an extra day, so dig a little deeper...

730
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,712
放在了野外的石頭上..
Put rocks over for wild...

731
01:30:59,782 --> 01:31:01,559
他們將不會對屍體做任何事情。
They will do nothing to the body.

732
01:31:02,646 --> 01:31:04,102
他被埋葬了。
He was well buried.

733
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,288
-主…真相就是如此…
- Lord... - The truth is...

734
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:11,597
當霍克消失了，他（格拉斯）擔心他被野人抓走了。
When Hawk disappeared he was worried about the savages.

735
01:31:12,027 --> 01:31:16,484
…我馬上就要準備去找霍克。
... I was ready to leave immediately.

736
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:19,570
布拉傑這裏，要求我留下來。
Bridger here, asked to stay.

737
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:22,242
要我和他待在一起知道他死去
Asked to stay until his death...

738
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:25,252
他至少修建了十字架…
Him at least built the cross with something...

739
01:31:25,991 --> 01:31:29,011
並且他把格拉斯放在了墳墓裏，給了他想要的東西…
And he puts over the grave Glass, and gave him what he wanted...

740
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:32,348
-這是我們所做的。布裏傑先生在那呆了會。
- It is what we did. - Happy that Mr. Bridger stay.

741
01:31:32,383 --> 01:31:33,356
就會知道他會的。
Would know he would.

742
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:37,376
更重要的是，這個人就是我的夥伴。
More importantly Captain, this man here is my partner.

743
01:31:40,395 --> 01:31:41,480
很好
Good.

744
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,524
我必須假設我們的治療沒有改變嗎？
Do I have to assume that our treatment has not changed?

745
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:49,772
我的運氣不錯。
To my fortune not.

746
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,338
謝謝你們
Thanks.

747
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:16,241
用你們的勇氣，榮譽
By their courage, honor...

748
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,031
-和生存
- And services. - If.

749
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:22,671
布拉傑不管你做的還是沒有做的，都值得了。
Deal or no deal with Mr Bridger, deserves for what he did.

750
01:32:23,512 --> 01:32:24,512
謝謝
Thanks.

751
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:38,749
這孩子一直都這樣.
The boy has torn all the way.

752
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:46,425
他也看到了格拉斯，所以不會作假，對嗎？
All saw the way he was Glass, you could not make it, right?

753
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:48,548
是的
Si.

754
01:32:50,172 --> 01:32:51,617
我們都看到了
All we saw.

755
01:33:00,429 --> 01:33:02,026
為什麼你不準備呢？
Why do not you prepare?

756
01:33:02,061 --> 01:33:02,605
下次
Next.

757
01:33:02,906 --> 01:33:04,269
一次。
Out at a time.

758
01:36:18,168 --> 01:36:22,040
當暴風雪來的時候...
When a storm...

759
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:30,121
你正站在一棵樹的前面…
And you're standing in front of a tree...

760
01:36:31,589 --> 01:36:37,554
如果你看見樹枝要墜落…
If you see the branches swear to be falling...

761
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:51,499
但是如果你看到了樹幹，你會注意到它很穩定。
But if you see the trunk, you notice stability.

762
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,270


763
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:15,431
有一個營地的痕跡…
There are traces of a camp...

764
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:18,346
有一個營地的痕跡…
There are traces of a camp...

765
01:42:20,297 --> 01:42:21,297
哪裏
Where?

766
01:42:21,387 --> 01:42:23,819
進入月亮森林的。
Entering the forest moon.

767
01:42:24,857 --> 01:42:29,236
也許離開了兩天,他們向東移動了。
Perhaps two days away. They move to the East.

768
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,741
去告訴其他人
Tell the others.

769
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:35,533
快去. 頗瓦恰可能和他們在一起！
Move fast. Powaqa can be with them!

770
01:42:56,675 --> 01:42:58,188
把那女孩帶來…
Bring the girl...

771
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:01,752
那五匹馬不太安靜。
Those five horses were not to free.

772
01:44:26,033 --> 01:44:27,408
別出聲。
Do not make a sound.

773
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,962
安靜
Silence.

774
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:49,448
我要一匹馬。
I will seek a horse.

775
01:44:50,037 --> 01:44:53,969
我會把你蛋蛋割掉。
I will cut your balls.

776
01:45:08,789 --> 01:45:11,084
杜桑去哪裏了？
Where is Toussaint?

777
01:45:14,513 --> 01:45:15,953
過來...
Come...

778
01:46:07,729 --> 01:46:09,764
我可以加入他們嗎？如果。
- Can I join them? - If.

779
01:46:09,799 --> 01:46:11,013
-是的
- Yes? - If.

780
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:15,195
我擔心他什麼時候可以支付每筆
I wondered when it would pay per carry.

781
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:19,752
我們收集的獸皮仍然在外面…
We collect skins are still out there...

782
01:46:20,429 --> 01:46:24,174
都是髒兮兮的，但那不是我的錯。
Are dirty and snow, but that's not my fault.

783
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:27,780
我希望隊長沃斯帶著他的軍隊…
I hope Captain Leavenworth arrives with his army...

784
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,481
和有足夠的人…
And then have the sufficient men...

785
01:46:29,545 --> 01:46:31,674
在回到那裏，向那些土著展示我們強大的文明…
To back out there and show civilization...

786
01:46:31,702 --> 01:46:35,322
對那些該死的印第安人，並拿回我們的獸皮。
Those damn Reds, and recover our skins.

787
01:46:35,412 --> 01:46:37,124
很好,很好。
Good, good.

788
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:39,843
現在應該是什麼時候發生的？
And now when supposed to happen is that?

789
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:41,818
我不知道，但是...
I do not know, but...

790
01:46:42,251 --> 01:46:43,938
不到那個時候，不會有人得到報酬得。
Until then nobody gets paid.

791
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:48,377
聽著，好嗎？
Listen, okay?

792
01:46:49,265 --> 01:46:52,523
…這份工作真的太艱難了…
... It was hard to get all worked hard...

793
01:46:53,227 --> 01:46:58,106
就像我看到的...的保證安全，
As I see... have a safe,

794
01:46:58,266 --> 01:47:00,809
-全部的錢。-你簽了合同的。
- Full of money. - You signed a contract.

795
01:47:01,454 --> 01:47:04,069
保護你的老闆的財產和你的老闆。
To protect your boss property and your boss.

796
01:47:05,454 --> 01:47:08,404
現在在我的保險櫃裏，連300美元都沒有。
And in my safe is no longer full, $ 300 falls short.

797
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:11,781
這到底是什麼意思？
 What the hell does that mean?

798
01:47:12,483 --> 01:47:14,483
根據我的記錄現金…
According to my records cash...

799
01:47:14,507 --> 01:47:18,020
由於公司的原因你錯過了它
With what you missed in issuing you end up owing the company.

800
01:47:23,629 --> 01:47:25,294
新年快樂，菲茨傑拉德先生。
Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzgerald.

801
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,384
菲茨傑拉德殺死了我的兒子
Fitzgerald killed my son

802
01:56:33,534 --> 01:56:34,739
有個白人在門外
White man at the door.

803
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:45,710
幹什麼？你是誰？
What? Who you are?

804
01:56:49,103 --> 01:56:51,488
我沒有武器，我沒有武器。
I have no arms, I have no weapons.

805
01:56:53,023 --> 01:56:55,303
-多布，去叫隊長。-我沒有武器。
- Dobb, looking Captain. - I have no weapon.

806
01:56:55,363 --> 01:56:56,580
你有什麼事？
What about your men?

807
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,880
-死了，都死了。-誰？
- Dead, all dead. - Who was?

808
01:57:00,144 --> 01:57:02,749
我不知道，有什麼吃的東西嗎。
I do not know, something to eat please.

809
01:57:02,828 --> 01:57:04,069
那是要價的。
That is priceless.

810
01:57:05,504 --> 01:57:08,277
-我沒有錢。—那就別吃了，該死的。
- I have no money. - Then do not eat it, that's that shit.

811
01:57:08,301 --> 01:57:11,248
也許你可以歸還被偷得獸皮來改變了印第安人的看法。
Perhaps you can return stolen furs you changed the Indians.

812
01:57:11,372 --> 01:57:13,274
約翰，西爾弗
- Now there Johns. - Silver.

813
01:57:13,309 --> 01:57:14,445


814
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:17,069
奧，真的嗎？
Oh, really?

815
01:57:18,077 --> 01:57:19,133
就這些麼？
Is that all you got?

816
01:57:21,662 --> 01:57:26,337
9…但我的朋友都在暴風雪中死了…
Were 9... But my friend died in the snowstorm...

817
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:27,950
其他人…
And the others were...

818
01:57:28,998 --> 01:57:32,032
狼…狼…被狼...
By wolves... wolves... By

819
01:57:33,409 --> 01:57:34,945
等等，你從哪兒得到了它（爐石傳說的標誌，也是醉了）？
Wait where did you get this?

820
01:57:35,863 --> 01:57:37,191
吃飯的地方
The canteen.

821
01:57:37,737 --> 01:57:39,707
他…他摔倒在雪地裏。
He... He fell in the snow.

822
01:57:40,232 --> 01:57:43,834
-誰？-我不知道，我沒有。我看不見。
- Who? - I do not know, I did not. I did not see.

823
01:57:46,042 --> 01:57:47,119
可能是霍克
Could Hawk.

824
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:53,099
-是的，可能是。-還會有誰？
- Yeah, it could be. - Who else would?

825
01:57:53,223 --> 01:57:54,983
-也許是西方。離這兒多遠？
- Maybe it was the West. - How far from here?

826
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:57,401
離這兒多遠？大約20公里…
- How far from here? - Some 20 kilometers...

827
01:57:57,542 --> 01:58:01,076
在東北方向…靠近黃石灘。
By Northeast... Near Yellowstone.

828
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:02,443
準備好馬。
Saddle up the horses.

829
01:58:03,064 --> 01:58:04,980

- Anderson, you stay here. - Yes sir.

831
01:58:08,489 --> 01:58:10,061


832
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:13,024
我要去喝一杯。
I'll get a drink.

833
01:58:25,614 --> 01:58:26,773
把門打開
Open the door.

834
01:59:04,572 --> 01:59:05,719
所有人停留調整。
All stay tuned.

835
01:59:08,037 --> 01:59:09,133
睜大眼睛
Eyes front.

836
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:13,950
放慢腳步
Soft.

837
01:59:14,916 --> 01:59:16,356
緩慢
Slowly.

838
01:59:21,092 --> 01:59:22,221
你是誰？
Who are you?

01:59:22,752 --> 01:59:24,737
Beckett? Are you?
Beckett? Are you?

01:59:36,324 --> 01:59:37,324
格拉斯

842

Okay.

844
01:59:40,532 --> 01:59:41,775
感謝耶穌
Jesus Christ.

845
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:43,583
感謝基督，發生了什麼事？
Jesus Christ, what happened?

846
01:59:44,875 --> 01:59:46,096
他在哪兒？
Where is he?

847
01:59:49,363 --> 01:59:50,932
約翰帶著他，來吧。
Johns take it, come on.

857
02:00:23,859 --> 02:00:24,859
菲茨傑拉德。

858
02:00:36,002 --> 02:00:37,264
-卡爾馬。-他在哪兒？

-誰？菲茨傑拉德。

860
02:00:40,299 --> 02:00:41,299
他去哪了？
Where did it go?

861
02:00:42,111 --> 02:00:44,554
-他沒有告訴我。告訴我，否則我會打爆你的頭。
- He did not tell me. - Tell me or I'll rip your head.

862
02:00:44,558 --> 02:00:47,370
-我向上帝發誓，船長。告訴我！
- I swear to God, Captain. - Tell me!

02:00:47,813 --> 02:00:49,303
-你告訴我！-和德克薩斯。
- Tell me! - A Texas.

864
02:00:49,338 --> 02:00:51,675
-德克薩斯？-他說他要去德克薩斯。
- Texas? - He said he was going to Texas.

865
02:00:52,331 --> 02:00:54,171
我向上帝發誓，他說這將重新開始。
I swear to God, he said it would re-enlist.

866
02:00:54,283 --> 02:00:57,341
他說想要購買一塊土地…
And he began to talk of buying, decent a piece of land...

867
02:00:57,884 --> 02:01:00,267
打算去德克薩斯。我向上帝發誓。
Going to Texas. I swear to god.

868
02:01:00,287 --> 02:01:01,357
呆在這兒.

869
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:05,830
菲茨傑拉德。

870
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:09,061
菲茨傑拉德。
Fitzgerald.

871
02:01:37,944 --> 02:01:39,008
惡魔。
Demons.

872
02:01:42,288 --> 02:01:43,471
詛咒。
Curse.

873
02:01:48,133 --> 02:01:49,352
打開門
Open the door.

874
02:01:49,837 --> 02:01:50,992
打開它。
Open it.

875
02:01:53,573 --> 02:01:54,881
找到船長
Find the Captain.

876
02:02:01,082 --> 02:02:03,392
快帶著他去找醫生。
Take him to the doctor, now.

877
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:06,298
你說他死了。

878
02:02:07,258 --> 02:02:09,778
-你說他死了。我以為他死了，我發誓。
- You said he was dead. - I thought he was dead, I swear.

879
02:02:12,028 --> 02:02:13,632
-你是個騙子。是他逼我做的。
- You're a liar. - He forced me.

880
02:02:13,653 --> 02:02:16,956
騙子，你離開。你離開了那裏。
Liar, you left. You left out there.

881
02:02:17,089 --> 02:02:19,439
-抱歉...-念祈禱文
- Sorry... - Mr. Di prayer.

882
02:02:19,477 --> 02:02:22,032
-什麼？-念祈禱文吧
- What? - Mr. Di prayer.

883
02:02:23,324 --> 02:02:24,840
我們的身父...
Our Father...

884
02:02:24,948 --> 02:02:27,940
誰在天上…我不能…
Who art in heaven... I can not...

885
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:28,772
閉嘴.
Shut up.

886
02:02:28,894 --> 02:02:32,300
閉嘴！現在你是一個被指控叛國的囚犯。
Shut up! Since you are now a prisoner on charges of treason.

887
02:02:33,016 --> 02:02:35,678
把他關進籠子裏。把他關進籠子裏。
Put him in a cage. Put him in a cage.

888
02:02:35,705 --> 02:02:37,196
把他關起來，否則我就開槍打你！
Lock him up or I'll shoot you!

889
02:02:38,252 --> 02:02:39,819
以為我會死。
Thought I would die.

890
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:42,951
-我不知道該怎麼辦…
- Arise. - I did not know what to do...

891
02:02:44,342 --> 02:02:45,938
我不能幫助。
I could not help, please.

892
02:02:46,952 --> 02:02:49,387
-船長..,求你-上帝！
- Captain... Please - God!

893
02:02:50,592 --> 02:02:51,904
好的，來吧
Okay. Come on.

894
02:03:00,744 --> 02:03:02,221


895
02:03:02,256 --> 02:03:03,900


896
02:03:23,092 --> 02:03:25,389
-怎麼樣了？-你會很好，沒有腫脹…
- How are you? - You'll be fine, no swelling...

897
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:26,660
你需要休息
You need rest.

898
02:03:27,101 --> 02:03:28,418
我就是回來看這個。
I'll come back to see this.

899
02:03:38,315 --> 02:03:40,154
他跑了，是嗎？
He escaped, right?

900
02:03:49,037 --> 02:03:51,142
布裏傑說的是真的…
Bridger tells the truth...

901
02:03:53,438 --> 02:03:57,159
-怎麼了？菲茨傑拉德撒謊…
- How is that? - Fitzgerald lied...

902
02:03:57,343 --> 02:03:59,004
他只是在下命令。
He was only following orders.

903
02:04:01,172 --> 02:04:04,646
我是不在在那裏當菲茨傑拉德刺傷殺死我的兒子。
I was not there when Fitzgerald stabbed to kill my son.

904
02:04:08,839 --> 02:04:13,775
發生了什麼？他殺了霍克？
Is that what happened? He killed Hawk?

905
02:04:18,496 --> 02:04:19,870
我需要一匹馬和一桿槍。
I need a horse and a gun.

906
02:04:19,905 --> 02:04:21,980
不，你現在需要休息和補充體力.
No, you need to rest and something to eat.

907
02:04:22,379 --> 02:04:24,296
-我要區追他-不
- I'm going after him. - No.

908
02:04:25,858 --> 02:04:28,172
-你不會找到他沒有我的話。
- You will not find him without me.

909
02:04:28,173 --> 02:04:30,752
-我不想讓他跑掉。
- I do not expect nor dawn and escaped.

910
02:04:30,915 --> 02:04:32,312
他跑不掉的
It will not.

911
02:04:33,682 --> 02:04:35,077
恐懼
Afraid.

912
02:04:36,690 --> 02:04:38,936
你知道我走了多遠。
You know how far I came.

913
02:04:40,374 --> 02:04:44,721
害怕，
Afraid, 

914
02:04:45,807 --> 02:04:47,558
我會把他帶到回來的…
I'll get him there, just...

915
02:04:48,323 --> 02:04:51,481
-他還不知道。-你怎麼能這麼肯定？
- He does not know yet. - How can you be so sure?

916
02:04:52,863 --> 02:04:54,993
我已經沒有什麼可以失去的了。
I have nothing to lose.

917
02:04:57,375 --> 02:05:00,088
我所有的全部就是霍克…
All I had was that guy...

918
02:05:01,216 --> 02:05:02,943
但他從我身上奪走了他的命。And he took it from me.

919
02:05:07,006 --> 02:05:08,872
我不能讓你回去
I can not let you go back out there.

920
02:05:09,403 --> 02:05:12,573
-不能再次,-不行
- Not again. - No.

921
02:05:14,321 --> 02:05:16,476
我不再害怕死亡。
I have no more fear of dying.

922
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:20,342
我準備好了
I already did.

923
02:05:26,335 --> 02:05:27,885
我和你一起去
I'm going with you.

924
02:06:43,682 --> 02:06:46,412
有馬的痕跡。是的
Are horse trails. Yes.

925
02:06:48,325 --> 02:06:50,200
沒有辦法繼續行走在夜裏。
There is no way to continue overnight.

926
02:06:50,791 --> 02:06:52,159
還有多遠？
How far ahead?

927
02:06:53,091 --> 02:06:56,658
?中間最大的痕跡，可能是印第安人的。
- Middle maximum day. - Could be the Reds.

928
02:06:57,767 --> 02:06:59,228
如果不是他，我們就找不到了。
If not him, we lose.

929
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:03,713
現實與正義的殺戮。
Be realistic and justified kill again.

930
02:07:04,714 --> 02:07:06,422
你的印痕在這裏是對的。
Your prints are right here.

931
02:07:08,547 --> 02:07:09,654
快
Come on.

932
02:07:16,659 --> 02:07:18,888
我都快記不得我妻子什麼樣了。
I can not remember the face of my wife.

933
02:07:19,997 --> 02:07:22,208
上周我還和我在一起。
Last week I was still with me.

934
02:07:24,183 --> 02:07:25,543
現在就記不住了
Now it is not.

935
02:07:28,943 --> 02:07:32,022
我不擔心，當你回家的時候。
I worry not recognize, when you return home.

936
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,431
你殺了一個軍官，這是真的嗎？
Is it true that you killed an officer?

937
02:07:51,346 --> 02:07:54,520
我殺了一個試圖殺死我兒子的人。
I just killed a man who tried to kill my son.

938
02:08:13,449 --> 02:08:16,972
- 煙。-多近了？
- Smoke. - How close?

939
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:24,285
不超過一公里但是有兩條路
No more kilometer and a half that way.

940
02:08:25,036 --> 02:08:27,984
我去西邊你去東面…
I go to the west and you see the East...

941
02:08:28,412 --> 02:08:32,849
-我們看我們是否發現了一些痕跡。如果是印第安人呢？
- We see if we find some traces. - What if the Reds are?

942
02:08:33,944 --> 02:08:37,604
如果是印第安人，你馬上回到這裏來
If you are red, you turn immediately to be here.

943
02:10:03,063 --> 02:10:04,088
嗨
Hey!

944
02:10:06,284 --> 02:10:08,442
不希望看到他的地位的人…
Not expecting to see a man of his status ...

945
02:10:09,381 --> 02:10:11,218
到目前為止，…
Fort so far, when...

946
02:10:11,253 --> 02:10:13,539
這麼冷的天，船長，你是迷路了嗎？
So cold this morning Captain, are you lost?

947
02:10:14,126 --> 02:10:16,268
我是來帶你回去的。
I'm here to take you back to Fort Kahowa.

948
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:18,740
你將被帶去那裏因為謀殺而得到審判。
Where you will be taken to trial for murder.

949
02:10:19,303 --> 02:10:20,520
是的，先生
Yes, sir?

950
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,121
這不是一個瘋狂的計劃.
I'm not crazy plan.

951
02:10:23,725 --> 02:10:25,553
另外，我只發現了你一個人
In addition, I have one of your own.

952
02:17:54,261 --> 02:17:56,303
格拉斯我已經做的很好了
Glass We had a deal.

953
02:18:00,178 --> 02:18:02,330
我試著去告訴你的孩子。如果？
I tried to tell your kid. If?

954
02:18:02,481 --> 02:18:05,510
試著告訴發生了什麼事，但他沒有聽…
Try telling what was happening, but he did not listen ...

955
02:18:05,558 --> 02:18:09,340
他一直在尖叫。他將把印第安人都引過來。
And still he is screaming. He is going to appeal to everyone.

956
02:18:11,634 --> 02:18:12,727
你和我...
You and I...

957
02:18:13,153 --> 02:18:14,374
得解決
Had a deal.

958
02:18:16,585 --> 02:18:18,242
我不知道你在外面發生了什麼
I do not know what happened out there.

959
02:18:19,362 --> 02:18:21,322
但我欠主的心，
But I owe my soul to the Lord,

960
02:18:21,429 --> 02:18:23,787
上帝知道發生了什麼。
Lord knows what happened out there.

961
02:18:27,082 --> 02:18:28,594
不可能。
No deal.

962
02:18:31,818 --> 02:18:33,392
你殺了我兒子
You killed my son.

963
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:39,176
或許你應該像個男人…
Maybe you should have raised a man...

964
02:18:39,377 --> 02:18:41,526
而不是一個尖叫的小母狗。
Instead of a screaming little bitch.

965
02:18:52,987 --> 02:18:54,514
該死
Damn!

966
02:21:18,005 --> 02:21:21,159
你來只是為了報復。
You came all this way just for your revenge.

967
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:26,108
格拉斯你很享受這一切嗎？
Is the enjoyed Glass?

968
02:21:27,383 --> 02:21:30,284
因為沒有什麼會讓你的孩子回來了。
Because nothing will return to your child.

969
02:21:53,838 --> 02:22:01,285
復仇是在上帝的手中…
Revenge is in God's hands...

970
02:22:01,529 --> 02:22:03,128
不是我
Not mine.
