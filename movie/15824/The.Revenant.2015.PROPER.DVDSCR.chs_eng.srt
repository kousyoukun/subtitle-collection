1
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,846
我的儿
Okay son...

2
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,357
我知道你想让它结束。
I know you want it to end.

3
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,105
我就在这里。
I'm right here.

4
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,496
我就在这里...
I'll be right here...

5
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,108
但不要放弃。
But do not give up.

6
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,090
你听到我的话了吗？
Do you hear me?

7
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:52,652
虽然你仍然可以屏住呼吸，但他仍在战斗。
While you can still hold one breath, still he is fighting.

8
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:56,535
呼吸…保持呼吸。
Breathe... keep breathing.

9
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,808
霍克。
Hawk.

10
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:13,950
卡尔马。
Calma.

11
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:33,990
tmd！
Oh fuck!

12
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:38,606
该死的混蛋。
Damn bastards.

13
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,859
只有我们收到了关于他的。
Only we received shit about him.

14
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,939
你看见库尔特了吗？ 不
- Have you seen Coulter? - No.

15
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,215
嗨，这些肉什么时候能弄干净？
Listen, when meat is clean...

16
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,042
我要你收拾好。
I want you to pack up tight.

17
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,542
请记住，我们包裹里兽皮不是15张…
Remember, we do not get 15 skins on the package...

18
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,714
每个包裹放30张。 菲茨杰拉德。
- Do 30 skins per package. - Fitzgerald.

19
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,073
船长。我们怎样来进行？
- Captain. - How are we to carry?

20
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,687
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

21
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,859
额...
Well...

22
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,882
无论他们在哪里，无论他们在那里打猎…
Think wherever they are, whether they hunt there...

23
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:16,950
我不需要另一个猎人。
I will not need another shot.

24
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,857
我们要赶在黎明前。
Move us ensure dawn.

25
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:20,315
今天上午已经准备好了，
Would have been ready for this morning,

26
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,143
我已经准备好了，如果可以的话…
I'd gone already here if my...

27
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,767
你知道我们现在的处境非常的不安全。
You know that we are not in safe territory.

28
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,244
我想这将是一个难熬的一天。
I think it will be just a few days ahead to Strong.

29
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,628
他们肯定会紧张…
All they have to worry...

30
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:29,332
这是给孩子们准备新鲜的肉。如果,
- It is to give the children fresh meat. - If.

31
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,379
如果…你见到了库尔特吗？
If... Have you seen Coulter?

32
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:36,975
嘿，我们放倒了头驼鹿。
Hey we lay down a moose.

33
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,445
超大的一头。
a big one.

34
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,147
我需要你们去帮我们。
I need help to get him.

35
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,063
让我猜猜什么时候你们剥完了皮
Let me know when to remove the skin.

36
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,350
我到很乐意去帮忙拿过来
I'll be happy to help then.

37
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,941
不，别这样...我需要你的帮助
No, come on... friends need your help.

38
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,709
我们需要休息一下…
We need to rest our butts packing...

39
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,617
弄了这么多的肉…
Took so long eating this damn meat...

40
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,942
我都开始担心我的妻子怎么处理这些了。
As I begin to wonder like cooking my wife.

41
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:56,008
该死，我开始想你的妻子。
Hell, I begin to wonder your wife.

42
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:57,268
闭上你的臭嘴
Shut the hell.

43
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,255
救命-库尔特…
- Help. - Coulter...

44
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,670
该死的.是库尔特吗？
- Fuck. - Is that Coulter?

45
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,086
呆在一起.吉姆，你去找船长。
- Stay together. - Jim, look for the Captain.

46
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,750
基督（祈祷上帝保佑）！
Jesus Christ!

47
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,249
-闭嘴！快来帮我！
- Shut up! - Help me!

48
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,454
安静…-沉默的声音…
- All tuned... - Hagan silence...

49
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:18,937
该死
Damn.

50
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,088
那是什么？
What was that?

51
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,066


52
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,329
我们走
Let's go.

53
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,499
他们在那里。
They are upon us.

54
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,489
我看不到他们
I can not see them.

55
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,509
-趴下，TMD
- Down. - Fuck.

56
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,629
他们到处都是。
they're Everywhere.

57
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,415
我们被包围了
We are surrounded.

58
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,863
-他们到处都是…
- They are everywhere. - Soho...

59
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,361
呆在这儿
Stay here.

60
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,545
不,不,奥,我的天！
No, no, no. Oh no!

61
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,390
待在下面
Stay below.

62
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,625
没有人能离开这…
Nobody leaves outdoors...

63
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,042
有人爬上了这座山！
What someone climb the hill!

64
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,637
没有人动，留在这儿。
Nobody move, stay where you are.

65
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,211
他们想要兽皮
They want skins.

66
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,916
如果不是你现在急着收包…
If you do not collect the packages now...

67
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,048
我们现在什么都没有了
We will lose them all.

68
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,172
去上船。儿子，船。
Go to the boat. The boat, son.

69
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,674
走,走,走.
Move, move, move.

70
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,225
走出这林子，走…
Get out of the forest, leaving the forest...

71
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:29,383
去船那边
Toward the boat.

72
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,974
霍克！
Hawk!

73
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,640
霍克,霍克.
Hawk, Hawk.

74
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,364
拿住那些兽皮.
Grab skins.

75
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,333
来，拿住兽皮。
Come on, grab the skin.

76
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,371
拿好兽皮.
Grab skins.

77
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,077
安.过来。
Agrrenlas. Come on.

78
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,462
过来
Come on.

79
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,061
坚持住，我们会得到帮助…
Hold on, we'll get help...

80
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,308
加油，继续走…
Come on, keep moving...

81
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:39,812
格拉斯
Glass !

82
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,060
快上船
Go into the boat!

83
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,533
该死的孙子
fuck  son ..

84
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,294
起来，去船那边.
Get up, toward the boat.

85
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,217
救命
Help.

86
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:25,537
走，跟上.
Move, come on.

87
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,238
快来
Come on.

88
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,831
-注意-切断绳子.
- Care. - Cut the rope.

89
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:34,414
把绳索切掉.
Cut the rope.

90
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,137
我要去下游.
I going downstream.

91
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,305
快上船.
Get in the boat.

92
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,350
求你们，别走，等等我.
Do not go, please.

93
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,473
我的女儿,颇瓦恰，他不在这儿.（这里伏笔--待会剧情之找女儿）
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

94
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:43,254
快拿上我们所以能带得动的兽皮.
Gather all the skins we can load.

95
00:12:43,747 --> 00:12:47,915
这些兽皮能让我们换到法国种马...
Will change the skins with the French horse...

96
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,957
快继续找.
And we continue searching.

97
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:55,623
尘埃还花…
And the dust returns flowers...

98
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:56,585
阿门
Amen.

99
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,423
当晨星在东方出现，争斗就结束了，我的心智就像黎明那般清净...
When the morning was clear...

100
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:04,460
阿门
Amen.

101
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:18,698
准备好了吗？
Ready?

102
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,689
别动
Do not move.

103
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,215
你从哪而学会的这本事？
Where did you learn that?

104
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,291
我的父亲是一名医生.
My father was a doctor.

105
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:34,571
-布里杰.-船长有一小队人马跟着我们…
- Bridger. - Captain have a small group following us...

106
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:36,037
希望这次能完成这次交易。
Hoping to finish the job.

107
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,326
-按住这儿.-如果
- Hold there. - If.

108
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,859
告诉我你有什么计划。
Tell me you have some sort of plan.

109
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,522
格拉斯
Glass.

110
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,390
密苏里的身体状况不太好。
The Missouri is not good.

111
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,900
它还有口气在。
There is still water running in it.

112
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,586
我们必须离开这条船…
We must get off this boat...

113
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,236
你想让我们下船吗？
Do you want to get off the boat?

114
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,677
我们应该怎么办？
What shall we do?

115
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,787
兽皮...
skins...

116
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,611
我们坐在那里，像一群该死的狗。
And we sat there on the tail, like a bunch of damn dogs.

117
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,142
最稳妥的办法是想到一个新的安排…
The safest thing to do is charting a new course...

118
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,277
我们走陆路
Back to earth.

119
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,591
对于这次“旅程”做好准备
Prepare the trip.

120
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,871
最好现在我们正在下沉，被那些白痴抓住。
Best sinking now, being caught those idiots.

121
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,109
他们现在正在盯着你呢，“乖儿子”.
Already they have eyes on you right now, son.

122
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:20,045
我想说的是我们现在被他们盯上了.
I say follow in the pot.

123
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,761
把船靠向岸边…
Put the course heading to Fort...

124
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,639
和走水路一样有风险。
And risk for water.

125
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,384
格拉斯比我们所有人都了解怎么走.
Glass territory knows this better than the rest of us together.

126
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,192
你的任务是带着我们安全的回去.
Your job is to bring them safely home.

127
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,572
-让他待我们安全的回去？-呵呵
- Take me home safely? - If.

128
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,036
我必须提醒你，我们已经失去了32个人.
Do I have to remind you that we lost 32 men ?

129
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
第33个也快了.
33 already.

130
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,481
他们都是好样的,菲茨杰拉德，不论多少损失。
They were my men Fitzgerald, is how many lost.

131
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,028
我们按照格拉斯说的做，服从命令.
We do what he says Glass, order this.

132
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,165
我们必须放弃水路.
We must release the boat.

133
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,466
如果我们继续这么走下去，这hallaran河就是我们的尽头。
If we track, which Hallaran the end of the river.

134
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,744
最好的方案是沿着斯卡拉走
The best course is scalar field...

135
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,481
去Fort Kahowa（地名）.
To Fort Kahowa.

136
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:03,638
-好吧.-这样的路线安全吗？
- Come on. - Insurance?

137
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:05,805
我一周前去过那里。
A week before arriving there.

138
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,353
至少我们要一些马匹。
At least something to change horses.

139
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:09,908
我到知道有一个地方你可以得到。
I know of no place where you can do that.

140
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,384
了解，船长.
Well, Captain.

141
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:13,900
放弃这艘船，这是个TMD决定。
Losing the boat, it is a fucking mistake.

142
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,989
印第安人也不愚蠢…
Besides the Red Indians are not stupid...

143
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:18,793
如果我们坚持下去，我们就可以穿过山峰。
If we keep it, we can down across the peaks.

144
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,879
你的行为就像你所说的,菲茨杰拉德。
You act like you know what you're talking of Fitzgerald.

145
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,076
你根本没法交流
No one is talking to you.

146
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,031
根本不听建议.
Do not listen anyway.

147
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:27,565
我不相信但我不得不必须忍受这该死的…
I can not believe I have to endure this shit ...

148
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:28,589
我说...
All I say...

149
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:30,720
这是一种方式...
Camp there is a way...

150
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:32,392
但我们会死在这儿.
And we can hang in there.

151
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:34,536
我们走陆路.
We walked.

152
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,120
好吧，你是老大听你的.
Yeah, sure we will.

153
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,522
我不大相信他，因为我都不知道他是做什么的.
Demons can not believe I do not know his work captain.

154
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:43,988


155
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,956
把兽皮藏在岩石中直到我们回来…
Hide packaging in the rocks when we return...

156
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,966
-记住.一定要在藏得地方做上记号。
- Pick. - Be sure to mark the place.

157
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,314
我们为这些岩石留下了一笔财富。
We left a fortune on these rocks.

158
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,490
这里没有更多的地方可以放置，我们就搬到山上。
No more room here, we move to the hills .

159
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,538
格拉斯.
Glass. Charts a course...

160
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:57,880
狭窄的路可能会把我们带到小溪旁。
The narrower may bring us near the stream.

161
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,904
是的
Yes, sir.

162
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:03,769
那不是对的
This is not right.

163
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,538
都知道，当我们返回时这些兽皮还能不能在。
All know that this forest will not here when we return.

164
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:09,359
我们没办法一直带着这些兽皮
There is no way we can take them all the way ...

165
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,261
返回到城堡。
Back to the Fort.

166
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:12,309
我们必须这么做…虽然存在很大的风险…
Not the way we go, well... It's a big risk...

167
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,715
我们将在它的领土上，希望你的双手自由。
We will be in its territory 'll want your hands free.

168
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,493
我试着告诉他不要丢掉这些皮。
I try to tell him not lose these skins.

169
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,290
你想要和这些兽皮待在一起还是活着？
You want to stay with skins or your life?

170
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,314
生活？
Life?

171
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,038
这是什么生活？我都快没命了.
What life is this? I have no life.

172
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,625
我拥有的仅仅是自由和获得这些兽皮而已.
I have just as freedom and get is with these skins.

173
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:28,624
TMD
Fuck!

174
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,341


175
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:33,811
不管如何,我都得回去...
No way, I'm going home...

176
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:36,519
我们一直忙了快六个月了，我累的就像头骡子
I've been six months breaking my back as mule

177
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,250
伸着自己的脖子...
Risking my neck...

178
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:40,015
死了的话
Men dying and why?

179
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,700
即等于失去了一切。
Almost lost everything.

180
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,439
这份活计从一开始就很操蛋.
The work was fucked from the start.

181
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:46,454
我们都会没事的.
We are well screwed.

182
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:50,866
你们想离开这里…
And you guys want to leave it here...

183
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,031
因为格拉斯先生在这儿
Because Mr Glass here

184
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,208
能解决掉这麻烦
Is supposed to fix the damn things.

185
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:58,509
-因为他知道很多山路.-远远超过我们所知道的.
- Because he knows a lot of hills. - Much more than we know.

186
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,397
是吧？
Yes?

187
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,424


188
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,213
带着他的儿子…
Brought his son...

189
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:07,519
我说他看起来像个野人
And it looks like a wild, if you ask me.

190
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,971
让他的儿子一个人.
Leaves his son alone.

191
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,458
我就说说.
I'm just saying.

192
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,589
野人…他们是野蛮人…
Wild... They are savages...

193
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:23,865
嗨，格拉斯
Hey Glass.

194
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,470
他们说的是真的吗？射中了一位中尉…
Is it true what they say? That shot a Lieutenant...

195
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,214
然后他生活在野蛮人中吗？
While living among savages?

196
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,319
菲茨杰拉德。
Fitzgerald.

197
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:37,360
死光了士兵和21人在印第安人…
Soldiers dead and 21 others in Indian...

198
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:39,474
但你和你的儿子是唯一活着的人。
But you and your son were the only ones walk out alive.

199
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,491
这就像是一个奇迹，不是吗？
It's like a miracle, is not it?

200
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:42,974
闭嘴,菲茨杰拉德。
Shut Fitzgerald.

201
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,151
是那样的吗？
Is that you?

202
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,766
射击你的同伴去救这只像狗一样的儿子？
Shoot one of your own to save this dog here?

203
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,313
-闭嘴。你想打孩子吗？
- Shut up. - You want to fight child?

204
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,821
你和那个男孩的妈妈**吗？
You were playing with the boy's mother?

205
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,887
-菲茨杰拉德！-他杀死了她？
- Fitzgerald! - He killed her?

206
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,730
你可以不在擦这枪了吗？我正在跟你说话呢
You can end the rifle, I'm talking about.

207
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:00,738
我正在工作。
I'm working on it.

208
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,562
当我在跟你说话的时候，你就这样做了。
You do it when you finish after talking to you.

209
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,987
-看着人渣.-这已经足够！
- Look slag. - It's enough!

210
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,352
忘了你的孩子。
You forget your kid place.

211
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:14,954
据我所处的地方，这是一支枪。
As far as my place is here, this side rifle.

212
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,055
走开,菲茨杰拉德.
Move Fitzgerald.

213
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,278


214
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:21,876
听我说
Listen to me.

215
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,995
现在只有几个小时的时间留给我们.
We only have a few hours left us light.

216
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,123
我们必须藏好这些兽皮...
We must keep these skins...

217
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,664
并且摆脱船，快点.
And get rid of the boat, come on.

218
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,906
是的,船长.
Yes, Captain.

219
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:32,291
我说过你是看不出来的，孩子。
I told you were invisible, son.

220
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,186
-至少…如果你还想活着…
- At least... - If you want to keep closed survive...

221
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
河口【地名】
Mouth.

222
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:40,709
-至少他听到了我…他们没有听到你的声音！
- At least he heard me... - They do not hear your voice!

223
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,803
只看你皮肤的颜色。
Only see the color of your skin.

224
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:44,862
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

225
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,234
你懂了吗？-是的
- Do you understand? - Yes

226
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,080
你必须听我的，儿子.
You must listen to me, son.

227
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:56,383
你不得不听.
You have to listen.

228
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:10,892
贝克特.
Beckett.

229
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,462
韦斯顿。
Weston.

230
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,181
为什么不跳呢？
Why not jump?

231
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,838
看起来我们似乎摆脱了他们。
It seems that changed their minds.

232
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,893
“聪明”的混蛋。
Clever bastards.

233
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,158
不错…
Astute ...

234
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,626
确实该舍弃那条船。
Should be on that boat.

235
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,930
你是对的
You did right.

236
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:00,312
是时候出发了
It's time to move.

237
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,501
该起了.
Rise.

238
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,780
我们得走了.
Let's go.

239
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,106
我马上来.
I'm coming.

240
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,368
你先躺着吧.
Best lie down.

241
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:18,955
当其他人准备好，我来叫你。
When other men are ready, send them to me.

242
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,355
我去西方.
I go to the West.

243
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,418
你是我的儿子
You're my son.

244
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,580
你是我的儿子
You're my son.

245
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,478
这儿只有两个.
There are only two here.

246
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,178
颇瓦恰不在这儿
Powaqa is not here

247
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,804
可能别人带走了她.
The others probably took her.

248
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,548
他们去了北边.
They went north.

249
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:09,777
我们将翻越这些山。
We'll take the trail in the mountains.

250
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,192
这是正确的决定吗？
Was it the right decision...?

251
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,605
丢下船走陆路?
Leave the boat?

252
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,169
我们不能继续沿着这条河。
We could not continue down the river.

253
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,168
字幕
We had flanked.

254
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:28,092
如果我们继续在地面上，山…
If we continue east on ground, mountains...

255
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,005
我们将节省一周的时间返回到家。
We saved a week to the Fort.

256
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,351
如果我们不改变任何路线的话。
That if we do not change anything on the way.

257
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,239
-你觉得呢
- Do you think you? - If.

258
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,839
菲茨杰拉德说的是真的吗？
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?

259
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,879
你来这儿是为了逃避法律的制裁？
What you came here running from the law?

260
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,836
格拉斯,保持冷静
Glass, just keep quiet.

261
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,179
你的儿子，看到了很多…
Your boy, has seen much...

262
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,726
你觉得有像母亲的权利吗？
Do you have a mother reunite the Right Thing?

263
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,686
他在这儿
There's something here.

264
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,757
格拉斯
Glass !

265
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,647
他在这儿
We have something here.

266
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,529
我的上帝
Christ almighty.

267
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,201
嗨,你
Hey, you.

268
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:24,002
嗨
Hey!

269
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:25,593
他在下面
It is below.

270
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,329
-快来帮我...-睁大你的眼睛
- Help me... - Keep your eyes open.

271
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:31,072
快来,我需要帮助.
Come on, I need help now.

272
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,279
格拉斯
Glass.

273
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,968
我的上帝
Oh my God!

274
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,349
-奥，基督-船长
- Oh Christ! - Captain.

275
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:40,813
给我破布!
Rags need now!

276
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,056
给我布堵住伤口
Press with rags where blood flows.

277
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:45,995
这儿
Prepare things.

278
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:48,212
布里杰，吸起来。
Bridger, suck it up.

279
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,834
-安静-我的天！
- Quiet. - God!

280
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:53,936
你不得不信他杀了那头灰熊。
You have to give him credit for that Grizzly carried with him.

281
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,886
应该是射死的，整个地方都充满了树…
Should shoot, the whole place is full of trees damn...

282
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,097
那足够了！
That's enough!

283
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,679
我们还在他们的领土上…
Continue in their territories...

284
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,642
他是一个像恶魔一样的男人。
It is one of our men, demons.

285
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:07,174
你们去四周警戒.
Aposten a circle around us.

286
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:09,071
你们两个去西边和北面。
North and west, leading to the two you.

287
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,294
比尔，弗里曼你们去南面和南面。

00:38:58,542 --> 00:38:59,633
好吧
Okay.

434
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:03,485
很好，如果布拉杰先生觉得，那我就呆在这儿.
Well, if Mr. Bridger feels the same way, I'll stay.

435
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:04,573
-你？-如果
- You? - If.

436
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,196
我已经丢掉了我的兽皮的收益...
I've lost my share of skins...

437
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,928
所以我不得不找一些额外的收入
So I have no choice but to look for other income .

438
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:13,874
所以多呆在这儿一两天也不会有什么不同
Also be here a day or two most not make a difference.

439
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,697
200美元，带着他回家
$ 200, is bringing something go home.

440
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,660
你需要照顾好格拉斯直到结束.
You need to take care Glass until the time comes.

441
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:19,684
明白了吗？
Understand?

442
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,599
是的，先生，你知道我的
Si. Yes, you have my word.

443
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:27,193
先生们，赶在天黑之前把他放在安全的地方吧
Guys, Lower him to some safer place before nightfall.

444
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:28,607
字幕
Already they have heard guys.

445
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:29,986
-菲茨杰拉德。队长。
- Fitzgerald. - Captain.

446
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:34,152
你必须照顾好格拉斯.
Glass must be careful much time as needed.

447
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,607
当死神来临的时候，给他一个适当的埋葬。
Y a proper burial when the time comes. He earned.

448
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,309
我懂得
Understood.

449
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,950
父亲，你能听到风吗？
Can you hear the wind, Father?

450
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:07,282
你还记得我妈妈过去常常说的什么吗？
Do you remember what my mother used to say wind?

451
00:40:07,834 --> 00:40:15,793
风不可能吹倒一棵有根的树。
Wind can not beat a tree with strong roots.

452
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,685
保持呼吸...
Still breathe...

453
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,129
我非常的想念她
I miss her so much.

454
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:51,920
我就在这里…
I'll be right here...

455
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,233
我就在这里…
I'm right here.

456
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,511
虽然你仍然可以屏住呼吸，但他仍在战斗。
While you can still hold one breath, still he is fighting.

457
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:09,918
吸气，保持呼吸.
Breathe. Keep breathing.

458
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:13,759
当暴风雪来临的时候…
When a storm...

459
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:21,960
你正站在一棵树的前面…
And you're standing in front of a tree...

460
00:41:26,238 --> 00:41:33,289
如果你看见树枝要坠落…
If you see the branches swear to be falling...

461
00:41:43,423 --> 00:41:51,360
但是如果你看到了树干，你会注意到它很稳定。
But if you see the trunk, you notice stability.

462
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,186
300美元是不可忽视的…
$ 300 is something not negligible...

463
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:39,633
我会去德克萨斯，我买一块像样的土地…
I will go to Texas, I buy a decent piece of land ...

464
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,354
我去如厕。
And I will begin to urinate into the wild.

465
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,042
我离开这个鬼地方。
I leave this godforsaken place.

466
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:51,200
你这样做吗？
The Reds you do that?

467
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,401
只是想知道。
Just wondering.

468
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:57,021
他们做了。
They did.

469
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,375
他们生活好了之后就搬进了城市
They took the city in which he was well.

470
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,909
一开始我就一无所有，
At the beginning I felt nothing,

471
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,650
只听到声音…
Only hear the sound...

472
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,253
刀刮我的头骨，你知道…
Knife scraping my skull, you know...

473
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,738
他们笑着，喊着，砰的一声…
They laughed and shouted and banged...

474
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,082
然后是血…
Then came the blood ...

475
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,040
寒冷开始侵袭我的脸和我的眼睛…
Cold started running down my face and my eyes...

476
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:20,369
呼吸…
The breathing...

477
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,290
我差点被淹死了。
I was drowning in it.

478
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,764
那是当我感觉到它。
That's when I felt it.

479
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:28,107
感觉到任何事
I felt everything.

480
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:31,434
我把我的头向后靠。
Toned I had my head backwards.

481
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:33,955
耶稣
Jesus.

482
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:36,050
是的，所以我要去德克萨斯…
Yes, so I'm going to Texas...

483
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,553
抢你，却不拿你的头。
Rob you, but do not take your head.

484
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:41,858
它是怎样的？
How was it?

485
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:48,890
你能停止噪音吗？
Could you please stop that noise?

486
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:51,226
我想说的是...丢掉它
I just... Leave it.

487
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:21,550
那些不能帮助你的人。
I'm full of skin and with guys who can not help you.

488
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:28,911
我们爬上了山，所以他们就不会再继续追了。
We climb the mountains damn so that we do not continue chasing.

489
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,535
如果你准备好了…
If you are ready...

490
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,337
享受这圣餐。
Take the sacrament.

491
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,047
我可以为你做。
I can do for you.

492
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,582
格拉斯你知道什么
What you cling Glass?

493
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:50,655
你想知道？
You know?

494
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,859
这将变得更好...
It would be better...

495
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:56,106
如果你给了那最后的呼吸。
If you gave that last breath now.

496
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:57,869
为了我们
For all of us.

497
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,541


498
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,050
一些事
That's something.

499
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,931
我恳求你格拉斯，
I beg Glass,

500
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,469
印第安人离我们很近，我甚至可以问到他们...
Reds are so close I can smell them now...

501
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:11,645
并且我知道你也可以，所以你不得不去考虑
And I know that you can smell them, and you have to think.

502
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:13,092
为你自己，和你的孩子.
Think of your boy.

503
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:15,846
很好，因为你将要杀了他。
Good, because you're going to kill him.

504
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,534
我们将杀了他们.
We will kill them all.

505
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,764
如果你想要的话我可以帮助你。
I can help if you want.

506
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:29,744
释放痛苦非常快速和容易的…
Quitarte suffering very fast and easy...

507
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,845
我想谁也不知道是你放弃了他。
Nobody has to know that you gave up. I would.

508
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,269
你所要做的只是眨一下眼镜…
All you have to do is blink...

509
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:36,552
如果你想让我这样做的话。
If you want me to do that.

510
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,931
救你的儿子和眨一下眼睛
Save your guy and flashes.

511
00:45:55,123 --> 00:45:56,892
可以的话你就眨下眼。
Just blink.

512
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,362
好的
yeahi.

513
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,452
奥，好的
Oh, yes!

514
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:08,276
愿上帝保佑你.
Hopefully the good Lord, us out of here soon.

515
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:14,900
也许原谅你的罪过，你知道，也许不是…
May forgive your sins, you know, maybe not...

516
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:17,091
你必须向主投降。
You must surrender to the Lord.

517
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:22,391
在基督里，主怜悯…
In Jesus Christ, the Lord have mercy...

518
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:29,095
别动，滚开。
Stay away. Get away.

519
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:32,651
你还好吗？吉姆。吉姆…帮助。
Are you okay? Jim. Jim... Help.

520
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,915
-帮助。平静。好了，不要喊。
- Help. - Calm. Well, do not shout.

521
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,702
-不要尖叫，你这样会杀死我们。让我们走。
- Do not scream, you want to kill us. - Let go.

522
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:54,535
我会告诉你你做了什么，你会死的.
I'll tell you what you did and you will hang.

523
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,012
-你必须明白…
- You have to understand that... - You hang, quotes...

524
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,527
Help. 吉姆快来。
Help. Jim come here.

525
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:01,606
睡吧孩子…
Silence guy...

526
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,266
TMD
Fuck.

527
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:19,826
你得生点火来做食喂他
You have to feed the fire.

528
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:23,562
他的呼吸变了。
His breathing changed.

529
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,810
注意。
Noticed.

530
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:30,193
我的天，他冷得像冰一样。
Hell, is cold as ice.

531
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:35,130
这儿，格拉斯先生...抬起头
Here Mr. Glass... This head...

532
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,154
这将使你感到温暖
Will keep you warm.

533
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:39,094
好的
Okay.

534
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,185
霍克在哪里？
Where is Hawk?

535
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,203
他不是和你在一起吗？
Was not he with you?

536
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:48,492
没有.-没有？
- No. - No?

537
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,762
我懂，格拉斯先生
I understand Mr. Glass.

538
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,520
很好
Good.

539
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,728
我想我会去看看我是否能找到。
I think I'll go see if I can find .

540
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,787
是的，这听起来是个好主意。
Yes, it sounds like a good idea.

541
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:09,768
霍克
Hawk!

542
00:49:10,276 --> 00:49:13,193
…你杀了我的儿子。
... You killed my son.

543
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:14,217
霍克
Hawk!

544
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:40,301
布拉杰，有大约20个人沿着河流走
Bridge, there are about 20 Reds for the stream.

545
00:49:41,038 --> 00:49:42,285
到这儿来。
Come over here.

546
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,387
收拾你的东西，让我们走。
Pick up your shit and let's go.

547
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:48,580
TMD,等等，我们该怎么做？
Fuck. Wait. What do we do?

548
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:50,421
快跑，马上.
Running, now.

549
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:53,494
-霍克怎么办？-这已不再是我们的问题。
- And what about Hawk? - It is no longer our problem.

550
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:55,635
我们不能离开这里。
We can not leave here.

551
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,434
他应该是在找我们
He is supposed browser.

552
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,749
他会找到它吗？
Will she find it?

553
00:49:59,784 --> 00:50:01,469
等等，格拉斯怎么办？
Wait. What about Glass?

554
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:04,170
我们现在有更大的麻烦，还有他的儿子
We have more problems than he, is now on his own.

555
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:07,192
不，不，我们发过誓的，要带他离开…
No, no, we made a promise Captain...

556
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:08,797
你必须给他一个适当的葬礼当时候到来。
You have to give him a proper burial when the time comes.

557
00:50:08,865 --> 00:50:10,141
你需要一支枪。
Well you need a rifle.

558
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,064
你不能做任何事情，你不能用你的手。
You can not do anything with one, you can not use your hands.

559
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:14,859


560
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:16,251
不，不，我们不能这样做。
No, no, we can not do this.

561
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:19,806
-我们别无选择。-我们不能.看。
- We have no fucking choice. - We can not. Look.

562
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,502
-好，葬礼…-你在干什么？
- Well, a funeral... - What are you doing?

563
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,112
你想要带着他？来吧。
Do you want to take? Come on.

564
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,524
不，等等...
No, wait...

565
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,247
冷静，听着……
Calma, Fitz slowly...

566
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,404
冷静
Calma.

567
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,029
-我不能…-该死…
- I can not... - Damn...

568
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:38,998
倒霉
Shit.

569
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:40,326
等等，等等
Wait, wait...

570
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:41,361
等等
Wait!

571
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:46,645
闭嘴
Shut up.

572
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:48,385
等等
Wait.

573
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:52,567
菲茨...
Fitz...

574
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,680
你在干什么？
what are you doing? - Like what do I do?

575
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:56,616
一个适当的埋葬。
A proper burial.

576
00:50:56,706 --> 00:50:57,706
像承诺的那样。
As promised.

577
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:00,337
-不，不。-为什么不呢？
- No, not so. - Why not?

578
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,390
格拉斯仍然活着。它活着。
Glass is still alive. Its alive.

579
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:07,786
那就枪杀了他。
so shoot him.

580
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:22,742
我们不得不走了
I have to go.

581
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,131
抱歉
Sorry.

582
00:51:27,303 --> 00:51:28,558
抱歉，抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

583
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:45,434
船长，在这里…
Captain, over here...

584
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,684
这下面有一条路。
There is a path below.

585
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,815
没办法通过经过。
No way to pass down here.

586
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,322
船长，我们必须爬过去
Captain, we must climb.

587
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:57,117
-穿过去的时候当心点。我们可能会掉下去.
- Cross over carefully. - O may all go to hell.

588
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,082
-地图上说什么？-继续攀登。
- What does the map say? - Keep climbing.

589
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,602
爬上去，船长。
Climbed Captain.

590
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:04,473
我们继续攀登。
We continue climbing.

591
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,225
直到我们到家。
Until we reach Fort.

592
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:11,679
跟上
Come on.

593
00:52:13,606 --> 00:52:14,869
-我们必须离开这里-如果。是的
- We must get out of here. - yeah.

594
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:16,522
我们已经快接近了。
We are already closer.

595
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:18,919
船长
Captain.

596
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:25,200
主…让我把他们带回去吧。
Lord... Let me take this.

597
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,352
跟谁？
Who I follow?

598
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:28,858
跟随你想要跟着的人。
Follow whoever you want.

599
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:30,059
我得到。
I gain.

600
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:35,222
布莱尔，来这儿！
Blair, come here!

601
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:01,674
我不会离开你的，我的儿.
I will not leave you, son.

602
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,830
我在这儿
I'm right here.

603
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:12,968
这火焰即将燃烧殆尽.
The fire is finished.

604
00:57:14,629 --> 00:57:16,136
别睡了...
Should not rest...

605
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,476
我们必须保持印第安人和我们之间的距离。
We must also put distance between the Reds and us.

606
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,309
好的
Well

607
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:24,667
印第安人不可能和我们一样快
A dozen Reds may not be as fast as us.

608
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,234
-20.什么？
- 20. - What?

609
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:30,564
我想说昨天你说你看到了20个印第安人
I thought you said you saw a 20 Reds.

610
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:32,166
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

611
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,787
你把我叫醒了。
you woke me up。

612
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:40,631
你说你在小溪下看到了20个印第安人。
You said you saw 20 Reds down the stream.

613
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:44,013
20或十几，没有问题…
If 20 or a dozen, no matter...

614
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,505
不打算告诉你留下来…
Not going to tell you to stay...

615
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,300
他们穿过了河，对吗？
Their cursed pens in the river, right?

616
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,770
菲茨杰拉德。
Fitzgerald.

617
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:56,178
当时你在河边干什么？
What were you doing by the river by yourself?

618
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,239
那时我们已经有足够的水了。
We already had plenty of water.

619
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:02,366
嗨
Hey!

620
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:05,673
菲茨杰拉德回答我，我在问你话呢
Fitzgerald Answer me, I asked you a question.

621
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:10,127
不要去问那些不重要的事情…
Do not go questioning by things that are not important...

622
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:12,704
回答我，否则我会打爆你的头。
Answer me or I'll blow your fucking head.

623
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:14,540
你可以射任何人
You can shoot everybody.

624
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,958
你现在还是会死在水里了
You'd still be back sunk in the water right now...

625
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:19,116
如果不是我
If it was not for me.

626
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,948
我不会回答这个问题
I do not answer questions...

627
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:25,420
你不需要知道你在问什么
You do not want to know what you're asking.

628
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:30,457
你想要知道为什么丢下格拉斯让他去死？
You want to know why you left Glass back to die?

629
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,246
也许
Maybe...

630
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:37,354
如果你不是一个小男孩你就不会知道他不可能活更久了
If you were not a little boy 'd know he was no longer alive.

631
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:39,836
我撒了谎，因为你还不是一个男人。
I tell lies because you're not a man.

632
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,498
是吗？因为你害怕死亡...
Yes? Because you were afraid of death...

633
00:58:42,522 --> 00:58:44,082
并且现在还在害怕，放下枪
And afraid now, lowers the rifle.

634
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,071
-印第安人。-怎么回事？
- The Reds. - What about it?

635
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,740
告诉我你说的哪句是真的
Tell me now and honest in what you say.

636
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:51,484
-放下枪.-你看到了印第安人了吗？
- Lower your rifle now. - You saw the Reds?

637
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:55,063
不
No.

638
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:57,815
一个都没有
Neither one.

639
00:59:00,755 --> 00:59:02,189
你居然骗我？
You lied to me?

640
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:03,958
我欺骗了我
you lied me.

641
00:59:08,113 --> 00:59:10,314
我不得不选择正确的方式
I had to get into right guy.

642
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:13,404
从现在开始，不再谈论什么…
From now on, no talk more about...

643
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,723
别再说什么了…懂吗？
Do not no point in what is already done... Understand?

644
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:18,741


645
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,313
现在是在上帝的手中…
Is now in God's hands...

646
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:24,654
神所赐的，是神所赐的。
And what God gives, God takes.

647
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,930
倒霉
Shit.

648
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,367
起来，跟上。
Get up, come on.

649
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:36,728
下一次，如果你还想要射击某人...
Next time, if you want to shoot someone...

650
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:39,780
最好使用你自己的
Better than you use... Better use powder...

651
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,527
改进你的步枪。
Improve your rifle.

652
00:59:44,738 --> 00:59:45,738
快
Come on...

653
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:48,492
跟上，快。
Follow. Come on.

654
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:52,592
真血。颇瓦恰。
True Blood. Could Powaqa.

655
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:06,443
一个死掉了小男孩
A dead boy.

656
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:16,839
一个男孩波尼。
A boy Pawnee.

657
01:04:17,837 --> 01:04:18,909
我们走
Let's go.

658
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:34,515
继续向前
Go ahead.

659
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:30,546
-谁做的？我不知道。
- Who did this? - I do not know.

660
01:14:38,783 --> 01:14:41,146


661
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:44,746


662
01:14:45,808 --> 01:14:47,757
他们在这里留下了一些东西。
They put some order around here.

663
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:54,143
这些印第安人从来没有像你想象的那样死去。
These Indians are never as dead as you think.

664
01:14:55,395 --> 01:14:58,608
看看他们，总是像臭狗屎。
Look at them, always reek of shit.

665
01:15:35,682 --> 01:15:37,084
这里有马。
We have horses here.

666
01:15:41,843 --> 01:15:42,954
快
Come on.

667
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:49,818
马

668

我们的抓住他们...

孩子你去另一边抓他们。

670
01:16:15,874 --> 01:16:16,914
你在想你死去的儿子？

671
01:16:17,758 --> 01:16:18,957
你在合适的的地方。
You are in the right place.

672
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,139
我想。

673
01:16:26,754 --> 01:16:29,014
-如果我们不可能帮助…-不

674
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,182
没有地方可以问。
No place to ask.

675
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,450
上帝为我们指引了道路，他们没有选择。
The good Lord puts us in the way, they have not chosen.

676
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,420
我爸爸是个虔诚教徒，你知道吗？
My dad you were a religious man, you know?

677
01:16:41,935 --> 01:16:44,033
我可以做它，杀死它或吃它…
I could do grow it, kill it or eat it...

678
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:46,537
无论他做任何事我都无条件的相信
And just he made it without believing and nothing was it.

679
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:50,855
有一次他去打猎。
And once he went hunting Hills.

680
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:52,402
打猎
Hunting Hills...

681
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:56,848
他遇到了一些过去和他一起打猎的朋友.
He met some friends Texans and went hunting.

682
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:00,572
在这之前他已经有了几百次的经验
It was routine had done hundreds of times before.

683
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:05,603
三天的屠杀，TMD但在星期六结束了…

684
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:08,548

01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:13,327
印第安人偷了他们的马
Comanches stole them horses...

687
01:17:13,704 --> 01:17:15,111
我饿了

688
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,405


689
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,611
他爬进泥里…
And he crawled in the mud...

690
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:23,158
在一组树中间…
In a group of trees in the middle of nowhere...

691
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:25,771
我进入了那该死的“海洋”…
I got into that ocean of shit...

692
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,568
并且在那里他找到了信仰。
And there he found religion.

693
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,218
一直
At that time...

694
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:31,336
他说...
He said...

695
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,206
他见到了上帝.
He found God.

696
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:42,100
它...

697
01:17:42,393 --> 01:17:43,561
“上帝"...

是一只松鼠。
Was a squirrel.

699
01:17:47,617 --> 01:17:49,797
是的，他曾经见过他

700
01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:55,111
他就说我发现
了上帝I found God, he would say.

701
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,759
他坐在那里聊天…
He sat and talked...

702
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:01,129
他光荣与崇高的虔诚…
His glory and sublime piety...

703
01:18:02,953 --> 01:18:05,088
但是我枪杀了个混蛋…
And I shot the motherfucker...

704
01:18:19,148 --> 01:18:21,128
威尔，睡觉吧

705
01:27:06,312 --> 01:27:08,918
我受伤了。
I'm hurt.

706
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:11,095
你遇到了什么事？
What happened to you?

707
01:27:14,012 --> 01:27:17,430
一只灰熊
A bear.

708
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:20,704
灰熊。
A Grizzly.

709
01:27:39,314 --> 01:27:42,752
我的朋友…他们丢下了我。
My men... They left me for dead.

710
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,107
并杀了我的儿子

711

苏人杀了我的人。
The Sioux killed my people.

713

我要去南方找更多的人。

714
01:28:09,067 --> 01:28:10,770
我的心在流血…

715
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:16,945
但复仇是在造物主的手中。
But revenge is in the hands of the creator.

716
01:28:25,765 --> 01:28:26,957
我带着你一起
Will travel with me...

717
01:29:35,062 --> 01:29:36,478
你的身体都快烂了。
Your body is rotten.

718
01:29:37,881 --> 01:29:39,184
你需要赶快处理
You need to heal.

719
01:29:44,914 --> 01:29:45,998
不然的话你可能会死掉
You could die.

720
01:30:01,052 --> 01:30:02,141
是的
Yes!

721
01:30:02,227 --> 01:30:03,913
这儿
There.

722
01:30:05,653 --> 01:30:06,847
我们造的
We made it.

723
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,342
你应该为我们感到自豪孩子
You should be proud of you boy.

724
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,390
是
Si.

725
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:15,735
我们服从命令…只是省略了葬礼的一部分。
Follow orders... Just omit the part of the funeral.

726
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:19,581
不要再问一些关于良心的问题，好吗？
Do not go down there with problems of conscience, right?

727
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:23,039


728
01:30:24,131 --> 01:30:26,050
现在，我们得做我们应该做的
Now, we did what we had to do.

729
01:30:54,692 --> 01:30:57,406
我们会拿出一天时间，所以深入挖掘…
We had an extra day, so dig a little deeper...

730
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,712
放在了野外的石头上..
Put rocks over for wild...

731
01:30:59,782 --> 01:31:01,559
他们将不会对尸体做任何事情。
They will do nothing to the body.

732
01:31:02,646 --> 01:31:04,102
他被埋葬了。
He was well buried.

733
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:07,288
-主…真相就是如此…
- Lord... - The truth is...

734
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:11,597
当霍克消失了，他（格拉斯）担心他被野人抓走了。
When Hawk disappeared he was worried about the savages.

735
01:31:12,027 --> 01:31:16,484
…我马上就要准备去找霍克。
... I was ready to leave immediately.

736
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:19,570
布拉杰这里，要求我留下来。
Bridger here, asked to stay.

737
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:22,242
要我和他待在一起知道他死去
Asked to stay until his death...

738
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:25,252
他至少修建了十字架…
Him at least built the cross with something...

739
01:31:25,991 --> 01:31:29,011
并且他把格拉斯放在了坟墓里，给了他想要的东西…
And he puts over the grave Glass, and gave him what he wanted...

740
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:32,348
-这是我们所做的。布里杰先生在那呆了会。
- It is what we did. - Happy that Mr. Bridger stay.

741
01:31:32,383 --> 01:31:33,356
就会知道他会的。
Would know he would.

742
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:37,376
更重要的是，这个人就是我的伙伴。
More importantly Captain, this man here is my partner.

743
01:31:40,395 --> 01:31:41,480
很好
Good.

744
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,524
我必须假设我们的治疗没有改变吗？
Do I have to assume that our treatment has not changed?

745
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:49,772
我的运气不错。
To my fortune not.

746
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,338
谢谢你们
Thanks.

747
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:16,241
用你们的勇气，荣誉
By their courage, honor...

748
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,031
-和生存
- And services. - If.

749
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:22,671
布拉杰不管你做的还是没有做的，都值得了。
Deal or no deal with Mr Bridger, deserves for what he did.

750
01:32:23,512 --> 01:32:24,512
谢谢
Thanks.

751
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:38,749
这孩子一直都这样.
The boy has torn all the way.

752
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:46,425
他也看到了格拉斯，所以不会作假，对吗？
All saw the way he was Glass, you could not make it, right?

753
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:48,548
是的
Si.

754
01:32:50,172 --> 01:32:51,617
我们都看到了
All we saw.

755
01:33:00,429 --> 01:33:02,026
为什么你不准备呢？
Why do not you prepare?

756
01:33:02,061 --> 01:33:02,605
下次
Next.

757
01:33:02,906 --> 01:33:04,269
一次。
Out at a time.

758
01:36:18,168 --> 01:36:22,040
当暴风雪来的时候...
When a storm...

759
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:30,121
你正站在一棵树的前面…
And you're standing in front of a tree...

760
01:36:31,589 --> 01:36:37,554
如果你看见树枝要坠落…
If you see the branches swear to be falling...

761
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:51,499
但是如果你看到了树干，你会注意到它很稳定。
But if you see the trunk, you notice stability.

762
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,270


763
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:15,431
有一个营地的痕迹…
There are traces of a camp...

764
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:18,346
有一个营地的痕迹…
There are traces of a camp...

765
01:42:20,297 --> 01:42:21,297
哪里
Where?

766
01:42:21,387 --> 01:42:23,819
进入月亮森林的。
Entering the forest moon.

767
01:42:24,857 --> 01:42:29,236
也许离开了两天,他们向东移动了。
Perhaps two days away. They move to the East.

768
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,741
去告诉其他人
Tell the others.

769
01:42:32,344 --> 01:42:35,533
快去. 颇瓦恰可能和他们在一起！
Move fast. Powaqa can be with them!

770
01:42:56,675 --> 01:42:58,188
把那女孩带来…
Bring the girl...

771
01:42:59,435 --> 01:43:01,752
那五匹马不太安静。
Those five horses were not to free.

772
01:44:26,033 --> 01:44:27,408
别出声。
Do not make a sound.

773
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,962
安静
Silence.

774
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:49,448
我要一匹马。
I will seek a horse.

775
01:44:50,037 --> 01:44:53,969
我会把你蛋蛋割掉。
I will cut your balls.

776
01:45:08,789 --> 01:45:11,084
杜桑去哪里了？
Where is Toussaint?

777
01:45:14,513 --> 01:45:15,953
过来...
Come...

778
01:46:07,729 --> 01:46:09,764
我可以加入他们吗？如果。
- Can I join them? - If.

779
01:46:09,799 --> 01:46:11,013
-是的
- Yes? - If.

780
01:46:12,017 --> 01:46:15,195
我担心他什么时候可以支付每笔
I wondered when it would pay per carry.

781
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:19,752
我们收集的兽皮仍然在外面…
We collect skins are still out there...

782
01:46:20,429 --> 01:46:24,174
都是脏兮兮的，但那不是我的错。
Are dirty and snow, but that's not my fault.

783
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:27,780
我希望队长沃斯带着他的军队…
I hope Captain Leavenworth arrives with his army...

784
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,481
和有足够的人…
And then have the sufficient men...

785
01:46:29,545 --> 01:46:31,674
在回到那里，向那些土著展示我们强大的文明…
To back out there and show civilization...

786
01:46:31,702 --> 01:46:35,322
对那些该死的印第安人，并拿回我们的兽皮。
Those damn Reds, and recover our skins.

787
01:46:35,412 --> 01:46:37,124
很好,很好。
Good, good.

788
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:39,843
现在应该是什么时候发生的？
And now when supposed to happen is that?

789
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:41,818
我不知道，但是...
I do not know, but...

790
01:46:42,251 --> 01:46:43,938
不到那个时候，不会有人得到报酬得。
Until then nobody gets paid.

791
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:48,377
听着，好吗？
Listen, okay?

792
01:46:49,265 --> 01:46:52,523
…这份工作真的太艰难了…
... It was hard to get all worked hard...

793
01:46:53,227 --> 01:46:58,106
就像我看到的...的保证安全，
As I see... have a safe,

794
01:46:58,266 --> 01:47:00,809
-全部的钱。-你签了合同的。
- Full of money. - You signed a contract.

795
01:47:01,454 --> 01:47:04,069
保护你的老板的财产和你的老板。
To protect your boss property and your boss.

796
01:47:05,454 --> 01:47:08,404
现在在我的保险柜里，连300美元都没有。
And in my safe is no longer full, $ 300 falls short.

797
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:11,781
这到底是什么意思？
 What the hell does that mean?

798
01:47:12,483 --> 01:47:14,483
根据我的记录现金…
According to my records cash...

799
01:47:14,507 --> 01:47:18,020
由于公司的原因你错过了它
With what you missed in issuing you end up owing the company.

800
01:47:23,629 --> 01:47:25,294
新年快乐，菲茨杰拉德先生。
Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzgerald.

801
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,384
菲茨杰拉德杀死了我的儿子
Fitzgerald killed my son

802
01:56:33,534 --> 01:56:34,739
有个白人在门外
White man at the door.

803
01:56:42,169 --> 01:56:45,710
干什么？你是谁？
What? Who you are?

804
01:56:49,103 --> 01:56:51,488
我没有武器，我没有武器。
I have no arms, I have no weapons.

805
01:56:53,023 --> 01:56:55,303
-多布，去叫队长。-我没有武器。
- Dobb, looking Captain. - I have no weapon.

806
01:56:55,363 --> 01:56:56,580
你有什么事？
What about your men?

807
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,880
-死了，都死了。-谁？
- Dead, all dead. - Who was?

808
01:57:00,144 --> 01:57:02,749
我不知道，有什么吃的东西吗。
I do not know, something to eat please.

809
01:57:02,828 --> 01:57:04,069
那是要价的。
That is priceless.

810
01:57:05,504 --> 01:57:08,277
-我没有钱。—那就别吃了，该死的。
- I have no money. - Then do not eat it, that's that shit.

811
01:57:08,301 --> 01:57:11,248
也许你可以归还被偷得兽皮来改变了印第安人的看法。
Perhaps you can return stolen furs you changed the Indians.

812
01:57:11,372 --> 01:57:13,274
约翰，西尔弗
- Now there Johns. - Silver.

813
01:57:13,309 --> 01:57:14,445


814
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:17,069
奥，真的吗？
Oh, really?

815
01:57:18,077 --> 01:57:19,133
就这些么？
Is that all you got?

816
01:57:21,662 --> 01:57:26,337
9…但我的朋友都在暴风雪中死了…

817
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:27,950

818
01:57:28,998 --> 01:57:32,032
狼…狼…被狼...
By wolves... wolves... By

819
01:57:33,409 --> 01:57:34,945
等等，你从哪儿得到了它（炉石传说的标志，也是醉了）？
Wait where did you get this?

820
01:57:35,863 --> 01:57:37,191
吃饭的地方
The canteen.

821
01:57:37,737 --> 01:57:39,707
他…他摔倒在雪地里。
He... He fell in the snow.

822
01:57:40,232 --> 01:57:43,834
-谁？-我不知道，我没有。我看不见。

823
01:57:46,042 --> 01:57:47,119
可能是霍克
Could Hawk.

824
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:53,099
-是的，可能是。-还会有谁？
- Yeah, it could be. - Who else would?

825
01:57:53,223 --> 01:57:54,983
-也许是西方。离这儿多远？
- Maybe it was the West. - How far from here?

826
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:57,401
离这儿多远？大约20公里…
- How far from here? - Some 20 kilometers...

827
01:57:57,542 --> 01:58:01,076
在东北方向…靠近黄石滩。

828

准备好马。

831
01:58:08,489 --> 01:58:10,061

我要去喝一杯。
I'll get a drink.

833
01:58:25,614 --> 01:58:26,773
把门打开
Open the door.

834
01:59:04,572 --> 01:59:05,719
所有人停留调整。
All stay tuned.

缓慢
Slowly.

838

感谢基督，发生了什么事？
Jesus Christ, what happened?

846

谁在天上…我不能…

闭嘴.

02:02:28,894 --> 02:02:32,300
闭嘴！现在你是一个被指控叛国的囚犯。

Put him in a cage. Put him in a cage.

894
02:03:00,744 --> 02:03:02,221


895
02:03:02,256 --> 02:03:03,900


896
02:03:23,092 --> 02:03:25,389
-怎么样了？-你会很好，没有肿胀…

900
02:03:49,037 --> 02:03:51,142
布里杰说的是真的…

901
02:03:53,438 --> 02:03:57,159
-怎么了？菲茨杰拉德撒谎…
- How is that? - Fitzgerald lied...

902
02:03:57,343 --> 02:03:59,004
他只是在下命令。
He was only following orders.

903
02:04:01,172 --> 02:04:04,646
我是不在在那里当菲茨杰拉德刺伤杀死我的儿子。
I was not there when Fitzgerald stabbed to kill my son.

904
02:04:08,839 --> 02:04:13,775
发生了什么？他杀了霍克？

我需要一匹马和一杆枪。

910
02:04:30,915 --> 02:04:32,312

911
02:04:33,682 --> 02:04:35,077
恐惧

912

02:04:40,374 --> 02:04:44,721
害怕，

02:04:45,807 --> 02:04:47,558
我会把他带到回来的…

02:04:48,323 --> 02:04:51,481
-他还不知道。-你怎么能这么肯定？

我已经没有什么可以失去的了。
I have nothing to lose.

917
02:04:57,375 --> 02:05:00,088
我所有的全部就是霍克…
All I had was that guy...

918
02:05:01,216 --> 02:05:02,943
但他从我身上夺走了他的命。And he took it from me.

919
02:05:07,006 --> 02:05:08,872
我不能让你回去
I can not let you go back out there.

920
02:05:09,403 --> 02:05:12,573
-不能再次,-不行

有马的痕迹。是的

925

没有办法继续行走在夜里。
There is no way to continue overnight.

926
02:06:50,791 --> 02:06:52,159
还有多远？

927
02:06:53,091 --> 02:06:56,658
?中间最大的痕迹，可能是印第安人的。
- Middle maximum day. - Could be the Reds.

928
02:06:57,767 --> 02:06:59,228
如果不是他，我们就找不到了。
If not him, we lose.

929
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:03,713
现实与正义的杀戮。

02:07:16,659 --> 02:07:18,888
我都快记不得我妻子什么样了。
I can not remember the face of my wife.

933
02:07:19,997 --> 02:07:22,208
上周我还和我在一起。

934
02:07:24,183 --> 02:07:25,543
现在就记不住了
Now it is not.

935
02:07:28,943 --> 02:07:32,022
我不担心，当你回家的时候。

936
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,431
你杀了一个军官，这是真的吗？

937
02:07:51,346 --> 02:07:54,520
我杀了一个试图杀死我儿子的人。

938
02:08:13,449 --> 02:08:16,972
- 烟。-多近了？
- Smoke. - How close?

939
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:24,285
不超过一公里但是有两条路
No more kilometer and a half that way.

940
02:08:25,036 --> 02:08:27,984
我去西边你去东面…
I go to the west and you see the East...

941
02:08:28,412 --> 02:08:32,849
-我们看我们是否发现了一些痕迹。如果是印第安人呢？
- We see if we find some traces. - What if the Reds are?

942
02:08:33,944 --> 02:08:37,604
如果是印第安人，你马上回到这里来

943
02:10:03,063 --> 02:10:04,088

不希望看到他的地位的人…
Not expecting to see a man of his status ...

945
02:10:09,381 --> 02:10:11,218
到目前为止，…

946
02:10:11,253 --> 02:10:13,539
这么冷的天，船长，你是迷路了吗？
So cold this morning Captain, are you lost?

947
02:10:14,126 --> 02:10:16,268
我是来带你回去的。
I'm here to take you back to Fort Kahowa.

948
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:18,740
你将被带去那里因为谋杀而得到审判。
Where you will be taken to trial for murder.

949
02:10:19,303 --> 02:10:20,520
是的，先生
Yes, sir?

950
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,121
这不是一个疯狂的计划.
I'm not crazy plan.

951
02:10:23,725 --> 02:10:25,553
另外，我只发现了你一个人
In addition, I have one of your own.

952
02:17:54,261 --> 02:17:56,303
格拉斯我已经做的很好了
Glass We had a deal.

953
02:18:00,178 --> 02:18:02,330
我试着去告诉你的孩子。如果？
I tried to tell your kid. If?

954
02:18:02,481 --> 02:18:05,510
试着告诉发生了什么事，但他没有听…
Try telling what was happening, but he did not listen ...

955
02:18:05,558 --> 02:18:09,340
他一直在尖叫。他将把印第安人都引过来。
And still he is screaming. He is going to appeal to everyone.

956
02:18:11,634 --> 02:18:12,727
你和我...
You and I...

957
02:18:13,153 --> 02:18:14,374
得解决
Had a deal.

958
02:18:16,585 --> 02:18:18,242
我不知道你在外面发生了什么
I do not know what happened out there.

959
02:18:19,362 --> 02:18:21,322
但我欠主的心，
But I owe my soul to the Lord,

960
02:18:21,429 --> 02:18:23,787
上帝知道发生了什么。
Lord knows what happened out there.

961
02:18:27,082 --> 02:18:28,594
不可能。
No deal.

962
02:18:31,818 --> 02:18:33,392
你杀了我儿子
You killed my son.

963
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:39,176
或许你应该像个男人…
Maybe you should have raised a man...

964
02:18:39,377 --> 02:18:41,526
而不是一个尖叫的小母狗。
Instead of a screaming little bitch.

965
02:18:52,987 --> 02:18:54,514
该死
Damn!

966
02:21:18,005 --> 02:21:21,159
你来只是为了报复。
You came all this way just for your revenge.

967
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:26,108
格拉斯你很享受这一切吗？
Is the enjoyed Glass?

968
02:21:27,383 --> 02:21:30,284
因为没有什么会让你的孩子回来了。
Because nothing will return to your child.

969
02:21:53,838 --> 02:22:01,285
复仇是在上帝的手中…
Revenge is in God's hands...

970
02:22:01,529 --> 02:22:03,128
不是我
Not mine.
