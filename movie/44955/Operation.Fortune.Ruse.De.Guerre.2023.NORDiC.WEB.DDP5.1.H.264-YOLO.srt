2
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,209
Nathan!

3
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:45,167
-How are you, old man?
-Very good, thank you, Mr. Knighton.

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,992
You look like the walking dead.

5
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,250
Yes, I'm always a little bit cold
when I've just got out of the bed.

6
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:53,876
Perhaps you can tell me why I've been
summoned 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning?

7
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,834
If you'd care to study the film

8
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,710
you'll see that two nights ago
some heavily guarded cargo

9
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,166
was ambushed outside of facility in Odessa

10
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,651
where 20 security guards
were mercilessly annihilated.

11
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,417
I want you to retrieve what went missing.

12
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,201
And to find out who the seller is,
who the buyer is...

13
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:13,804
and what it is.

14
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,334
So we don't know exactly what it is, sir?

15
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:20,417
No, that is the mystery.

16
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,231
But our analysts and intelligence
reported that very quickly

17
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:26,041
it became extremely popular
with the wrong sort of people.

18
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,576
And with a price tag of around 10 billion

19
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,716
I don't think we can afford
for it to remain a mystery much longer.

20
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:37,417
It's been given a name "The Handle."

21
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:40,459
But why me,
why not the official intelligence branch?

22
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:45,834
<i>Ruse de Guerre</i>, Nathan.
An unorthodox approach to war.

23
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:48,835
I need a creative, cunning
and unconventional vision

24
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:51,451
to retrieve this kind of material threat.*

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,042
A Currier on a bicycle
in congested traffic.

26
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,492
Not the official team.

27
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,839
They take forever
to wave through the administration

28
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,882
and the clock does ticketh.

29
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:06,709
-So, who would be heading up your team?
-The usual chap: Orson Fortune.

30
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:11,167
Oh, fuck!
That man is an administrative nightmare.

31
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,514
He can't fly unless there's a private jet
because of claustrophobia,

32
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,500
then he needs sedating with the finest
claret because of agoraphobia,

33
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:20,014
and then there's a rehabilitation
in the Maldives

34
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,742
because of a clouda bloody -phobia.

35
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:26,367
Yes, I understand, sir,
but when you cut back on his expenses

36
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,833
and created a mental health department
it was a perfect storm.

37
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:32,792
He's trained to exploit
every system presented,

38
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:36,715
which is why he is a very
bicycle Currier you require.

39
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,718
Where is he?

40
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:42,375
That's funny you should say that, sir,
he's on one of his rehabilitation retreats.

41
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:48,292
Yes, you are paying for that, sir,
but don't worry, I think I can pull him in.

42
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,250
-The fuck are you doing here, Nathan?
-Everything alright, Orson?

43
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:54,142
No, it's not.
I'm supposed to be on a holiday.

44
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:57,333
And you're supposed to be
four thousand miles in that direction.

45
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:01,834
Actually it's three thousand miles
in that direction, but whatever.

46
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:05,709
-Mind if I come in?
-Yes, I fucking do.

47
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,153
-Aren't you gonna ask why I'm here?
-No, I'm fucking not.

48
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:09,291
Because you're not staying.

49
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,584
Wouldn't be here if it wasn't serious.

50
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,245
I don't care how fucking serious it is.

51
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:16,208
I'm on holiday and I'm not interested
in working at the moment.

52
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:20,603
There's a price to pay
to possessing a unique set of skills

53
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,875
being as brilliant as you are,

54
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,959
and please don't take this the wrong way,

55
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:30,709
as a private contractor your government
pays you handsomely for.

56
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:34,709
I'm ignoring this apparition.
I'm talking to an empty space.*

57
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:38,876
And I'm gonna meet
my girlfriend at the bar.

58
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,938
Ah, yes, about that girlfriend of yours.

59
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:45,375
It seems as though
she's not just your girlfriend.

60
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,866
But don't worry,
I will fly her home first class.

61
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,333
Have you been spying on me, Nathan?

62
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:54,167
I am sorry, but something
rather nasty has been stolen.

63
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,584
How nasty?

64
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,746
Under File A there's File B.

65
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,166
That's the list of nefarious potential
buyers whose interest has been aroused.

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,876
We don't know what was stolen.
That remains a mystery for you to solve.

67
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:10,542
But we need to stop it
getting onto the open market.

68
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,209
-Threat's imminent.
-How imminent?

69
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:14,491
Imminently imminent.

70
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,958
Put it this way, when you hit the ground
you'll be running, literally.

71
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:21,292
I've got the plane, the BPJ,
this year's model.

72
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:26,083
And all your medicinal requirements:
82, 96, 2004...

73
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:31,000
Marinade, and I'll see you in two minutes.

74
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,542
<i>Fine, so Orson will be heading your team.</i>

75
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,709
<i>-Will you be using John, the comms man?</i>
<i>-Sadly not, sir.</i>

76
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,432
-Isn't he the best?
-He might be good.

77
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:43,291
But he turned out to be
something of duplicitous snake.

78
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:48,916
-He went over to Mike Hook's team.
-Ah, Mike, the competition.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,332
Yes, I do hope we won't be competing
for the same prize

80
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,625
on this mission with Mike?

81
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,701
There is more than one
Security Department in this government.

82
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,375
Mike is on another job.

83
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,959
Very good, sir.

84
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,250
-Afternoon, Lucinda.
-Sir.

85
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,995
-I was starting to worry.
-I had to get changed.

86
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,083
Didn't we all?

87
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,501
-Captain, can we warm the engines up?
-Right away, sir.

88
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,876
-Isn't that the 82?
-It's still drinking well.

89
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,375
-Except this is my medicinal requirement.
-Yes.

90
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:22,000
Thirsty, were you?
Party for one. Like all your parties.

91
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,407
-Is it the usual team?
-Minus John.

92
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:30,999
-Where's John?
-John's got poached.

93
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,459
-By who?
-By <i>whom</i>. Never mind.

94
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:37,709
But I do mind. I know John, I like John,
I trust John, he's a pro.

95
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:40,292
-Someone paying him more?
-Yes.

96
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:43,358
- If I asked, would you pay me more?
- You can ask.

97
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,291
-Would you pay me more?
-No.

98
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,959
You're above that grumpy self interest.
You're a patriot.

99
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,125
And besides, no one gets treated
like you get treated.

100
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,083
When you say "you" you really mean <i>you.</i>

101
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,209
-Anyway, who's my footman?
-I found a splendid replacement.

102
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,167
-What's his name?
-Sarah Fidel.

103
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,626
Strong <i>nom de guerre.</i>
Never heard of him.

104
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,916
-It's because she's an American.
-She...

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,667
Lucinda, bring the 2004 Haut-Brion please.

106
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:14,876
Ah...

107
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:20,626
I'll help myself to a beer.

108
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,398
<i>I have a rather fabulous replacement
for comms John.</i>

109
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,750
An American,
much more versatile and creative.

110
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:31,626
-Sarah Fidel.
-Didn't she work with Mike?

111
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,158
Mike, consistent with his character
abandoned her in Beirut,

112
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:36,500
which is where I picked her up.

113
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,542
-Any other footman?
-Yes, this young man.

114
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,918
JJ Davies. There really isn't
very much he can't do either.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,709
Comms, guns, driving, diving,
wrapping, slapping, you name it.

116
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:51,292
They are both two comprehensive footman,
the perfect all-rounds.

117
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:04,959
-Isn't that JJ? What's he doing there?
-He's joined the team.

118
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:08,273
He's a good kid,
but he's a little bit green.

119
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,792
He's been very busy
since you last saw him.

120
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:15,209
He's what you might call
enthusiastic, hungry, keen.

121
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,250
Don't get your fingers near his mouth.

122
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:19,959
-JJ.
-Sir.

123
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,584
Mr. Fortune, meet Miss Fidel.

124
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:27,125
-Miss Fidel.
-Your Highness.

125
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,059
Probably you're the new John.

126
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:34,834
Not meaning a toilet
or a prostitute's client I take it.

127
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,626
Please don't pee on me,
I don't do that anymore.

128
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:46,083
John didn't have a personality.
I liked John.

129
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,292
You can call her John
if it makes you more comfortable.

130
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,167
-He was reliable.
-Wasn't that reliable.

131
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,584
-Heard he got poached by my old team.
-Your old team?

132
00:08:56,667 --> 00:09:01,083
The other leading private contractor,
favored by your government.

133
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,969
You worked for Mike?
Mike - the competition Mike?

134
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:07,750
You may not like Mike, but Mike is good.

135
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,250
What do we got?

136
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:12,885
A bagman, coming in on a flight
with a hard drive.

137
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,792
We need to track him.
See where he takes it.

138
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,733
I'm gonna keep an eye on you.
Feed you constructive information.

139
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:18,708
Play the right music.

140
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,858
I control the turntables,
you control the dance floor.

141
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,375
You like to dance?

142
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:25,886
I like John.

143
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,746
We'll send him some flowers
on your behalf.

144
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,700
Got anything yet?

145
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:45,708
Okay, I'm getting somewhere very slowly,
still dialing in.

146
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,709
Can you hear it?

147
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:52,292
Do you actually know
how to use a computer?

148
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,501
I'm sure I can find my way
if you just tell me where the on button is.

149
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:59,142
Nathan, we've been here for three hours.*

150
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:01,999
<i>She's your responsibility,
she slips I piss on you.</i>

151
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,584
I hired her. I trust her.

152
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,334
We have a three hour window.
He's gotta be with us soon.

153
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,958
-In fact, on cue, I think I got him.
-About time.

154
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,379
<i>Hiding in that crocodile
should be the drive,</i>

155
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:18,500
<i>what's on the drive we don't know.</i>

156
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,036
<i>Orson, just remember he's a bagman,
a retired professor,</i>

157
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,289
<i>not a threat,
or a black belt in Mogadishu.</i>

158
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,383
<i>I'll try not to frighten him to death.</i>

159
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,750
<i>We just need to know
who he's delivering it to.</i>

160
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,469
<i>Whizz-kid, what am I looking for?</i>

161
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:33,792
Brown hat, spectacles,
crocodile-skin briefcase, upper level.

162
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,000
<i>He should be coming into your peepers now.</i>

163
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,253
<i>I'm in his phone, and I'm gonna send
him a message: "Car is delayed."</i>

164
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:41,875
<i>-You see him, sweetheart?</i>
-Got him.

165
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,542
<i>Sending him to Luigi's coffee bar,
ground floor.</i>

166
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:47,667
-How do you know it's him?
-You dance, I play, remember?

167
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:50,751
-Jane, he's heading your way.
-In position.

168
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,876
JJ, take the B stairs.

169
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,065
He's passing me now.
Heading to coffee shop.

170
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:01,972
<i>He's all yours.</i>

171
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,792
I still see you in position.
Jane, respond.

172
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,542
Jane?

173
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:15,417
-Wakey, wakey, whizz-kid.
-Orson, I'm getting no response from Jane.

174
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,459
JJ, keep your peepers peeled
and your hands out of your pockets.

175
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,125
Peepers peeled, hands flying free.

176
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,542
Marcia, the job is yours,
catch him at the counter.

177
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:28,334
<i>-Confirm when the tracker's in place.</i>
-Moving in now.

178
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,167
-Why do I smell something rhey?
-I smell it too.

179
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,459
Marcia, confirm tracker in place.

180
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:43,626
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!
Confirm tracker in place.

181
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,340
Why do I get the feeling
we're not the only team in town?

182
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>Can't be. I would know.</i>

183
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:54,000
That's odd, either it's a glitch
in the network or someone is very good.

184
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,375
In my experience it's seldom the network.
Who could do that?

185
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,751
John. John could do that.

186
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:06,000
Smells like Team B.
Nathan, what the fuck are they doing here?

187
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:10,959
If that weasel John is here
it means that turd Mike is too. Stand by.

188
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,167
-Nathan.
<i>-Mike isn't on a different job, is he, sir?</i>

189
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,250
Or is it a coincidence that his team
is in Madrid airport?

190
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:22,792
If he's there
it isn't because of my department.

191
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,057
My world works
in a similar fashion to yours.

192
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,473
The government
likes to keep departments competed.

193
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,583
Competition for the best condition.

194
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,488
Mike only has two talents:
Blowing his cover and blowing himself.

195
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:35,572
But thanks for the heads up.

196
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,310
Orson, confirmed.
Mike is here to track the crocodile.

197
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:40,664
Mike's clumsy and predictable,

198
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,958
they're not here to track him,
they're here to pick him up.

199
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,417
I resolved the glitch,
we're going back live.

200
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:49,792
JJ, change of policy.
Not go in, go out. Exit 2F pincer.

201
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,751
On it, boss.

202
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,904
You have two inbound.
Eight and six o'clock.

203
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:58,111
Understood.

204
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:03,916
Just tell me
they haven't tasered the girls.

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,751
<i>-Oh, yes, tasered.</i>
-Let me feel your rhythm, whizz-kid.

206
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:12,626
-Count me in.
<i>-Three, two, one.</i>

207
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,584
Take a deep breath, that's right.

208
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:35,750
<i>Our man is en route to exit.
Main gate departures. Two bees in pursuit.</i>

209
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,959
<i>I'm on it. I'm exiting
through the parallel doors.</i>

210
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,542
Gracias.

211
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:44,131
<i>He's moving to taxi. 49502.</i>

212
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:46,041
-Nathan, you're needed.
-Incoming.

213
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,042
<i>-JJ, your location?
-Exiting through east parallel doors.</i>

214
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,162
<i>Senor? Senor? Hola Senor.
-Mr. Bakker...</i>

215
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,792
No, no, I cannot come with you.

216
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,042
<i>Two more bees buzzing in the car.</i>

217
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,792
-Mr. Bakker.
<i>-Lo siento señor. Lo siento senor.</i>

218
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,583
Heart. Heart.

219
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,709
JJ, wheel.

220
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,751
-What's wrong with him?
-Don't know.

221
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,246
-He keeps saying he's hot.
-No, no, heart.

222
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,527
Loosen his tie.

223
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,960
He doesn't feel very hot.

224
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,494
He's not hot, you idiots,
he has a heart condition.

225
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,125
There's two of them in pursuit.

226
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,262
<i>The drive will be encrypted
but I can clone it remotely.</i>

227
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,645
Connect me to the hard drive.

228
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,954
The road is blocked.

229
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,357
They have my wife. They will kill her.

230
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,417
JJ, lock the doors.

231
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,834
There's dozen of them. Fully armed.

232
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,459
Get out! Get out of the vehicle, now!

233
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:01,375
I need more time.
I need another 20 seconds.

234
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,375
They don't me. My face.

235
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,292
You go to The Duchess.
Table 12 6 p.m. Save my wife!

236
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,125
Four...

237
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:24,459
<i>Three... two...</i>

238
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,000
Open the door!

239
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,626
<i>I've got it. Let it go.</i>

240
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,167
We gonna need a shovel.

241
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,834
-Nathan.
-Mike. Nice of you to knock.

242
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:51,042
-Orson.
-Mike.

243
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,375
That belongs to me.

244
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,876
-What'd you do to our friend here?
-You scared him to death, Mike.

245
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,083
It's good, sir.

246
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,459
It's like a mouse always gets the cheese.

247
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,918
Let's go.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,292
<i>The drive is good but it's scrambled,
without the data key it's useless.</i>

249
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,459
<i>So our best option deliver the drive
and find out who the buyer is.</i>

250
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:41,218
<i>No one interesting has joined the rooftop
in the last 40 minutes, so...</i>

251
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,918
whoever you're there to meet
is already there.

252
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,529
Here we go.

253
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:50,250
Nathan, your file says you're terrible
at accents, so don't talk.

254
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:53,417
Bakker?

255
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,667
Is this for me?

256
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,417
Have a good evening.

257
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:12,417
I think I got him.
He's coming back as Ben Harris.

258
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:18,042
Ben Harris. He's the lawyer/consigliere
to Greg Simmonds.

259
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,080
-Who's Greg Simmonds?
-It's a billionaire arms dealer.

260
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,542
Only plays in the top tier.

261
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,667
Interested in selling 9mm to kids,
he's selling tomahawks to terrorists.

262
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:29,292
He's impossible to catch. Pretty elusive.

263
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,293
He only uses Ben Harris
on his biggest deals,

264
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,686
like if he's turned up in person.

265
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,792
Speaks for itself.

266
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:38,487
Oh, hello. This might be useful.

267
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:40,208
Greg's hosting a charity event in Cannes.

268
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,000
That's convenient,
cause we're also going to Cannes.

269
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:46,502
-Seems he loves an orphan.
-He wants two. He made enough of them.

270
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:56,334
We've picked up some time, so we'll be
arriving into LA in less than four hours.

271
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,334
LA?

272
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,167
When I put my head down,
we were heading to the South of France.

273
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,375
So, can someone please tell me
why are we flying to Los Angeles?

274
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:14,501
-The power of no, Nathan.
-I'm sorry?

275
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,468
Backwards to go forwards.

276
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:18,625
We're going to LA
to pick up our invitation.

277
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,375
-That being?
-Danny Francesco.

278
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,959
Danny Francesco? The movie star?

279
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:35,209
Goddamnit!
I do the stunts, you shoot the money.

280
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:38,774
Wake up, everybody!

281
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,250
Chad, get out of the fucking car!

282
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:44,554
Greg Simmonds'
favorite movie star - Danny Francesco.

283
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,221
And how does that get us in?

284
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:49,083
You can't catch this fish
with conventional lures.

285
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,250
Greg wants what everyone wants -
what they can't have.

286
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,626
There's nothing he can't buy
apart from Danny Francesco,

287
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,259
who recently snubbed
a 10 million dollar offer

288
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,622
to jump out of a cake
and sing him Happy Birthday.

289
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:04,744
He's obsessed with celebrities,
but more obsessed with their partners.

290
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,959
Sarah will be going as Danny's girlfriend.

291
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,140
It's the fish
that can't be caught, Nathan.

292
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:11,231
The power of no.

293
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:15,459
And how do we turn
this movie star's "no" into a "yes"?

294
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:19,626
-I think we've got something.
-Blackmail?

295
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:23,751
-Yeah, blackmail.
<i>-Ruse de guerre...</i>

296
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,792
Very good. Carry on.

297
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,034
So how are you gonna play this?

298
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:28,294
I found some spectacular dirt

299
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,958
on the infamous
movie producer Saul Goldstein,

300
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,637
so I've told him into help us.

301
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:36,208
I asked Saul to lure Danny to Vegas
under the premise of the five picture deal.

302
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,669
But as Greg is hosting
his Charity Fund Raising event

303
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:39,899
that we would like to attend

304
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,583
you're going to ask Danny Francesco
to come with us instead.

305
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:47,209
Creative work.
So what we got on Danny Francesco?

306
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:50,042
He's having an affair
with his sister-in-law.

307
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,209
I told you she was good.

308
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,959
Leave this with me.

309
00:19:56,042 --> 00:20:00,209
Fucking Swedish accent, fucking Swedish...

310
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:06,250
What are you doing, Saul?
Saul, you're a fabulous producer…

311
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,653
I mean you're a piece of shit,
but you're fabulous producer.

312
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:10,867
Everybody wants to work with you.
I wanna work with you.

313
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:15,542
But a Swedish accent, Saul?
Come on, I'm an American.

314
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,458
Hello, Natasha.
Andy's not gonna need you on this fly.*

315
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,501
-Really?
-Yeah, on of those things.

316
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:27,125
I appreciate that, Danny.
But we need you to do this for us.

317
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,417
For us? What, the royal "us"?
What are you talking about?

318
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:38,000
-I mean you have to do this for us.
-I have to?

319
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,450
I don't mean to contradict you, Saul,

320
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,834
but I don't have to do anything
for anybody.

321
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:48,834
And I don't wanna contradict you, Danny,
but we all have to do our bit.

322
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,542
I'm sorry, I though you were here
to serve the coffee.

323
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:57,083
Why do I suddenly feel
like I'm being ganged up on here, Saul?

324
00:20:57,167 --> 00:21:01,876
-Who are you?
-I'm your new manager.

325
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:05,083
I'm sorry, kid,
they had something on me too.

326
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,959
Okay, Saul, where are you going?

327
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm gonna let you converse
with your new manager.

328
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,417
You're gonna do great, Danny.
You're a star.

329
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:17,759
Saul, hey, Saul,
where do you think you... this is---

330
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,083
-See you soon.
-Saul...

331
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,792
Don't you dare to leave-- Natasha!

332
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,626
Where is Natasha?

333
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:28,584
Who let this man on my plane?

334
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,792
Natasha!

335
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,183
This is my plane!

336
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,125
Yes, it is, Danny,
and it's a lovely plane.

337
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,542
But you're gonna have to trust me
for two minutes.

338
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:38,713
Why should I?

339
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,333
Because you're an actor.
You're a movie star.

340
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,312
Because you're a professional.

341
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:48,167
Imagine we're on the scene.
Please, sit down.

342
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,436
Are you a patriot?

343
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,458
I don't vote Republican
if that's what you mean.

344
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:04,507
Okay, let me give it to you
in a different way.

345
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,876
The world needs you
for you greatest role yet.

346
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,626
You and I are going to a party.

347
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:16,667
-Who are you?
-I'm your manager, Charlie Rosewood.

348
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:20,918
You're no longer going to Vegas.
We're going to Cannes.

349
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,873
No, you are getting off of my plane
and Natasha's gonna make you.

350
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,375
Natasha? Natasha?

351
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:31,125
-What the fuck have you done with Natasha?
-Please calm down.

352
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,167
There's a sensitive and awkward situation
between you and your sister-in-law.

353
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:41,042
That you probably
shouldn't have filmed.

354
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:56,000
-I actually love my sister-in-law.
-Yes, Danny, you made that quite evident.

355
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:05,537
Turns out everyone thinks
you're a superstar, Danny.

356
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,750
Once they heard you were in town
they came to us.

357
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,792
Stop.

358
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,364
I don't think I can do this.

359
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,140
-No, no... nope.
-Danny.

360
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:17,916
-Danny.
-Trust yourself.

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,487
No need to be nervous.

362
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:22,125
No reason to be nervous?
They are only killers.

363
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:25,149
We've all seen you handle killers before
on a screen.

364
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:26,750
Fundamentally there's no difference.

365
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:29,513
What do you think an agent does? They act.

366
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:32,458
And no one acts better that you, Danny.

367
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:37,250
The best agents are stars,
the best actors are movie stars.

368
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,769
I guess that's sorta true.

369
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,916
You're an actor. Act.

370
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,859
There's a big difference
between an actor and a movie star.

371
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:47,870
And that is why
they're obsessed with you.

372
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:48,916
Yeah.

373
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,876
That and the fact that I didn't jump out
of a cake for 10 million dollars.

374
00:23:56,417 --> 00:24:00,792
Okay, while I'm busy playing my part
what are you two gonna be doing?

375
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:02,695
We need to get close enough
to Greg Simmonds

376
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,428
to remotely access his cell.

377
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go to work.

378
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:46,916
<i>Walking on set.</i>

379
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,511
Good.

380
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:51,171
Remember, you are not there
to buy anything.

381
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:55,125
I'm sure I don't have to remind you

382
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:59,584
that you spent the entire annual budget
on wine during the flight over.

383
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,492
<i>So lay off the wine,
concentrate on getting into Greg's phone,</i>

384
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:05,661
<i>and identify who's actually buying
this Handle.</i>

385
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:06,728
Understood.

386
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:09,342
Danny, we good?

387
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,875
Good? Is that a joke?

388
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,695
Remember, you're a professional.

389
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,999
-You're playing yourself.
-But I've never played myself--

390
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,573
-You can do this.
-Danny.

391
00:25:18,657 --> 00:25:20,852
<i>Lot number four
from the Quintess Collection</i>

392
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,916
<i>is a pair of diamond
and sapphire earrings.</i>

393
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,336
<i>And a round of applause, please,
sir Jonathan Mendes</i>

394
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,542
<i>for winning the 258,000 dollars--</i>

395
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:33,751
...happy ending,
because he was diagnosed with...

396
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:37,876
-What's that funny cancer?
-Is there a funny cancer?

397
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,637
I can't remember what it was
but it was something like cock cancer.

398
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,602
And he...

399
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,667
-Would someone pinch me, please?
-Pinch you, why?

400
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,661
Because I think I'm dreaming.

401
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,042
Is that...

402
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,326
Is that Danny Francesco?
You know I'm a little bit excited...

403
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:59,334
-I do love Danny Francesco.
-Everyone loves Danny Francesco.

404
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,501
I'm a little bit starstruck.
I am. It's not cool, but I am.

405
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:05,042
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

406
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,912
-Hi.
-Danny, do you like this...

407
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:10,269
Do you like this piece?

408
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,250
Love it.

409
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:17,654
It's one thing utilizing the expense cap
because you have psychological issues,

410
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:19,958
it's another thing
bankrupting the department.

411
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:24,250
What's he doing here?
Is that you, Benjamin bunny?

412
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,959
Not guilty, Mr. Simmonds.

413
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,667
-It was you, wasn't it?
-It's a surprise, sir.

414
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:31,626
How much is that fabulous item?

415
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,834
Lot number 15, 1.5 million dollars.

416
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:38,417
Lot number 15
from the Habsburg collection.

417
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:42,417
-Do you like it, Danny?
-It's wonderful. 1.5 million you say?

418
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,209
Anything Danny buys he can pay
for himself, he can afford it.

419
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:49,876
-He likes it.
-Don't you fucking dare, Orson.

420
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,528
-I'll take it.
-Orson!

421
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:54,250
Sadly he can't, it's no longer available.

422
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:55,301
Shame.

423
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:58,041
It's not a terrible shame,
it now belongs to you.

424
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:01,501
Complements of Mr. Simmonds.
He's a big fan.

425
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:04,167
Mr. Danny Francesco...

426
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,910
Look at you. The one and only. The legend.

427
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:08,951
You're very kind.

428
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,166
I'm Greg Simmonds,
and I wanna thank you very much

429
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,880
for all the entertainment
you've provided us over the years.

430
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:15,875
Thank you.

431
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:20,209
Listen, it's a fantastic gesture,
but I can't accept it.

432
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:23,209
No, you can. And you can for two reasons.

433
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:28,959
One - you deserve it.
Two - it's a fund raiser.

434
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:33,667
Speaking of which,
would you care to meet Trent and Arnold,

435
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:37,042
who are both are in the biotech.
I don't wanna be vulgar, but...

436
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,602
Twenty two billion, 17 billion.

437
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,964
Sorry, boys, I didn't wanna
be indiscreet, but you know...

438
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:43,125
facts are facts.

439
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,450
And they are both sponsoring
tonight's event.

440
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:47,333
-Hey.
-Big fan.

441
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,292
Oh, thank you. Great cause.

442
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,598
We try, you know...

443
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:54,446
Orphans, war...

444
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,100
Let me introduce to you
the lovely Michaela.

445
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:05,167
-What an absolute pleasure.
-The pleasure is all mine.

446
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,459
Can I just say,
are we allowed to say these things now?

447
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,501
Wow. Wow. Wow.

448
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:14,792
-Hello, what's your name?
-Charlie Rosewood.

449
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:18,250
-Hello, Charlie.
-My business manager, Charlie Rosewood.

450
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:21,250
Are you sure?

451
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:24,709
You don't look like a business manager.

452
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:29,125
-Books, covers...
-Oh, yeah, big book, aren't you?

453
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,191
He's doubled my money
in the last three years.

454
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:33,542
Is that right?
You got any tips for me then?

455
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,919
I don't think you need any tips,
do you, Mr. Simmonds?

456
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:38,041
You'd be surprised, I'm very very greedy.

457
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:42,250
But maybe tonight you'll be loosening
the purse strings a bit for us.

458
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:47,417
No tax benefits, so no chance.
And Danny doesn't like kids.

459
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,453
You know, actually we've got two
of the board orphans here tonight,

460
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:59,368
and they're really annoying.

461
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,475
I don't want to be pushy,

462
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,642
but there's a lot of very interesting
people at this party, and I would...

463
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:08,417
Emilia, could you take that
for me, me darling?

464
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,584
I would love you to meet some of them.

465
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,335
Mr. Simmonds, I would love to,
I'm just-- I'm actually quite shy.

466
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,041
Danny, it's the least you can do.

467
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:21,125
Mr. Simmonds here just spent
1.5 million on you.

468
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:26,042
But no, to be accurate, I didn't spend it
on Danny, I spent it on Michaela.

469
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:32,083
Suggestion, why don't we all retire
to the cocktail master?

470
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,596
That's what you usually call me,
right honey?

471
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,883
Minus the tail.

472
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:43,834
I don't think I believe what I just heard.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

473
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:47,074
Come on, over to the bar.
You're gonna wash your mouth out there.

474
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:48,508
Come on, Danny.

475
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,716
So I grabbed him by the balls,
and I say:

476
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,317
"If you'll speak like that to her again

477
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,916
I'm gonna rip off your head
and shit down your neck."

478
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,751
But I feel something,
I feel a little lump,

479
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:14,042
Two days later
he's diagnosed with testicular cancer.

480
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,667
A year later he wins
his first Tour de France.

481
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:21,918
I love that. He's funny, isn't he?
And he's naughty too.

482
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,626
-Yes...
-Go on, Danny, give me some more.

483
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,375
<i>How are we gonna get to his cell?</i>

484
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,958
His guard still has it,
we've been watching her. Go find her.

485
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:34,292
-One for the footman then.
-Really, why can't you do it?

486
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,608
You wanted to be more than a whizz-kid?

487
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:39,958
You wanna get in the field?
Get your shoes dirty.

488
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,595
Go on, everyone, have another cocktail,
keep him busy.

489
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,417
He cost a fortune,
didn't you, Jean-Pierre?

490
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:46,298
Look at that! Look at that! It's magic.

491
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,667
That's it, do with the monkey business.
Flip, flip...

492
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:51,589
I'll get you yours, Michaela,
why don't you go to the powder room.

493
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:52,958
Thank you so much.

494
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,292
Not so much magic, it's just a little bit
of practice, I can do that.

495
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,879
While I'll powder my nose

496
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,875
what would you be doing,
Mr. Charlie Rosewood?

497
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:04,292
The waiter behind you
was also at the Madrid airport.

498
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,961
Nathan, Mike's back again.

499
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:08,208
I heard. You deal with Greg.
I'll handle Mike.

500
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:12,292
You do your thing and I'll do mine.

501
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,876
Okay, sweetheart.

502
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,579
Go on then, give us some more,

503
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:19,313
go back to the dirty ones,
cause I like them best.

504
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:26,250
<i>Lot number six from the Delamont collection
is a one of kind blue sapphire encrusted...</i>

505
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:28,751
-Where am I going?
<i>-She's near his office.</i>

506
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,458
Yes, thank you, I know, where is it?

507
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,375
Keep going, and then turn left at the end.

508
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,501
<i>You must stay in range for a couple
of minutes for me to get a lock.</i>

509
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:39,435
Evening, Nathan.

510
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,291
You got your boys in
to mess things up again?

511
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:45,542
Mike, nobody likes you. Even your wife.

512
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,651
Well, that's what she told me anyway

513
00:31:47,735 --> 00:31:50,375
whilst trying to untangle herself
from my chest hair.

514
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,959
<i>One day you'll grow up, Nathan,
and you'll realize -</i>

515
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:56,951
I've got more money, more men, more Intel.

516
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:58,875
You don't stand a chance.

517
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,256
<i>In which department?</i>

518
00:32:00,346 --> 00:32:03,076
<i>She did whisper you have
an alarmingly small penis.</i>

519
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,076
<i>And I know you have
an incredibly small brain.</i>

520
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,792
<i>Is it me that should be worried?</i>

521
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:10,133
<i>Still running operations
out of the back of your garage?</i>

522
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:11,916
<i>At least I have an operation.</i>

523
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,079
<i>There's a difference between
you needing an operation</i>

524
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,500
<i>and me having the operation.</i>

525
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,465
<i>We're way ahead of you
on this, Nathan.</i>

526
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,041
<i>Outclassed as usual.</i>

527
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,964
<i>You'll only mess this up
like you do all the others, Mike.</i>

528
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:23,634
<i>Stay outta my way.</i>

529
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:29,792
Spew good little buggy.

530
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:33,584
-Okay, what do I do now?
<i>-Stay where you are.</i>

531
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:36,129
Emilia is in the room
the other side of that wall.

532
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:37,708
I can get a lock if you stand there.

533
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:40,042
<i>Keep backing up towards the door.</i>

534
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,125
If I get any closer
my ass is gonna go through it.

535
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:47,780
JJ, who is this guy?

536
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:49,667
<i>With you in a minute,
I'm dealing with Sarah.</i>

537
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,254
Hurry up, cause I'm on him.

538
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:53,281
<i>Okay, the phone's on now.</i>

539
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:02,042
Can I help you?

540
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,250
Hi. I was just looking at this painting.

541
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,834
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-Michaela.

542
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:15,083
I'm here with Danny Francesco.

543
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,459
That's it. I saw you earlier.

544
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:22,501
Greg told me he had this amazing painting,
and he knows I'm an art lover, so...

545
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,640
I actually curate
Mr. Simmonds' collection.

546
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:27,708
-No way.
-Yeah.

547
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:31,542
-This is actually an original Rhed.
-Wow... Rhed with an H.

548
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:37,042
Wow, you really know your stuff,
that's pretty esoteric.

549
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:41,918
-Do you work in the art?
-No, I'm just an enthusiast.

550
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,417
I still need a few minutes.
Keep him talking.

551
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:49,871
I'm always curious
about the philosophical details

552
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:51,834
behind a collector's motivation.

553
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:56,876
-We diving somewhere deep here?
-I don't know, are we?

554
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,577
<i>Orson, you're not gonna like him.
He's a horror story.</i>

555
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,690
<i>He's Vincent Young, ex special forces.</i>

556
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,439
<i>He's good with his feet,
and worse with his hands.</i>

557
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:06,970
<i>Alright, JJ, I didn't need
his life story, I just wanted his name.</i>

558
00:34:07,054 --> 00:34:08,208
<i>Now disconnect his comms.</i>

559
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:12,209
Good evening, sir.
Vincent, is it?

560
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:15,709
-Vincent, can I hear Orson?
<i>-Sorry, how can I help you, sir?</i>

561
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:19,042
Relax, Mike cannot hear
this conversation.

562
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,375
Here you go, Michael, enjoy this.

563
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:26,792
Vincent? Vincent!

564
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:30,167
-Comms disconnected.
-Who's Mike?

565
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,209
We can play that game if you wanna.

566
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:36,751
But one way or another
you gonna swim to the shore.

567
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,501
Vincent!

568
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,042
Please, continue.

569
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:46,042
I am interested in the paradox
of the dualistic motivation.

570
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,459
He will try and bribe you. Don't listen.

571
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:53,125
The only question is,
are you gonna do it with the broken nose...

572
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:59,876
or with your face intact
and this watch on your wrist.

573
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,480
<i>The canvas should be a portal</i>

574
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:06,250
into the abstract
infinite life transcendent,

575
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:10,250
which of course gives creative expression
its inner value.

576
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,222
Mike? Checking, Mike.

577
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,167
Fuck you, Orson!

578
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,083
Checking.

579
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,834
<i>Were is the paradox?</i>

580
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:24,334
The paradox is that there's beauty
in the filth.

581
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,459
-What else have you got?
-Good question.

582
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:32,375
I admire men with a strong sense
of self preservation.

583
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,501
However there is a limit.

584
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:44,125
What was wrong with the watch?

585
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:51,250
The most beautiful roses
come from the ugliest manure.

586
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:56,000
I feel like I'm on the couch.

587
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,042
I still got a minute to go.

588
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,667
Anywhere it's a theory, I have no idea
if it has any credibility.

589
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:07,667
Where did you get that from?
You got one for me?

590
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:32,125
Vincent, one more chance,
while your nose is still straight.

591
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,292
Which hand?

592
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,751
Left or the right?

593
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,398
It was right.

594
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:53,967
Now, if you don't mind
I'll take my watch back.

595
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,834
Yes, Sarah.
Good work. Wrap it up.

596
00:36:56,918 --> 00:37:01,250
Rich people if you hadn't noticed,
they like to show off.

597
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:05,918
-I'm gonna head back.
-Great chatting with you.

598
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:10,167
-What's your name again?
-Michaela.

599
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,292
-Have a great night.
-You too.

600
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:17,591
-What's next for Danny Francesco?
-My next film role?

601
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:18,879
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:23,417
I'm playing a mysterious
self-made billionaire

603
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:28,667
who goes on a transcendental journey
from material genius to spiritual giant.

604
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:31,292
That's a bit spooky, isn't it?

605
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,308
You just described me.

606
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:36,054
Idea, Danny, shush, idea.

607
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:40,167
Why don't you come spend
a little bit of time with me.

608
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,459
And do your research,
find your character, all of that.

609
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,375
Charlie?

610
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:47,595
Michaela. Success?

611
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,851
-Of course. Success?
<i>-Success.</i>

612
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,230
Be with you shortly.

613
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:54,364
<i>I will go rescue the movie star then.</i>

614
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,667
Good luck, Vincent.

615
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:09,313
Michaela, my darling, your boyfriend
wants to use me, don't know why,

616
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:11,375
as an inspiration for his next film.

617
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,462
Gave me an idea.

618
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:15,699
Why don't you both come
and have a little vacation

619
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,583
in my Turkish villa this weekend.

620
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,959
And Danny gets to pick up some tips.

621
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:22,876
Shadow me, you know.

622
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,458
Do whatever I do. Wherever I do do.
What do I do?

623
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:30,542
-We'll find out.
-You will. Is that a good idea?

624
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:35,792
I mean I have a couple things going on
but I think I can rearrange some things.

625
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:40,125
You, Michaela, have a lot going on,
but what about this weekend?

626
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:44,327
-Gregory, how are you?
-Oh, Lord, look who's here.

627
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,501
<i>Privet, za zdorovje.</i>

628
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:50,696
We've been waiting for you
to introduce us to Danny Francesco.

629
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,590
Danny, I'd like you to meet
my very good friends,

630
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:55,970
Alexander, and Natalja,

631
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:59,583
and Big Jev, and sulky Katja

632
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,059
and somewhat scary Dimitry.

633
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:02,916
Dimitry, nice to meet you.

634
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,876
Man, I'm such a fan, you mind if I...

635
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,867
-Selfie? Selfie time.
-Yes.

636
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:10,041
But be gentle with him.

637
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,584
-Go on then.
-Danny please.

638
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,218
This is fantastic.

639
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:21,417
Everyone just-- why don't you
just crowd around a little tighter.

640
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:23,776
-They are piranhas, aren't they?
-Yeah.

641
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,375
Now, that is a feeding frenzy.

642
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:28,334
-Another one.
-Okay...

643
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:30,585
He's gonna come out of there a skeleton.

644
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,250
<i>Just watch where you're putting
your hands, Dimitry.</i>

645
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,000
Why are you looking at me like that, Greg?

646
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:44,751
I think you know
why I'm looking at you like that.

647
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:49,000
And you know that I'm spoken for.

648
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,737
I do, and I respect that. I do.

649
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,797
But will you allow me
to flatter you for a moment?

650
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,250
Danny is a famous actor,
and that is very impressive,

651
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:03,709
but actors all work for someone,
don't they?

652
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:08,626
You strike me as someone
who doesn't take orders.

653
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:11,424
No, shush, cause I'm talking.

654
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:15,098
I think you are a free spirit.

655
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm not sure what that means.

656
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,226
It's been a pleasure.
It's been an absolute--

657
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,052
Do you remember this movie
where you were kicking the bad guy--

658
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:28,125
Come here.

659
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:36,792
The world is a much, much bigger place
than you could possibly imagine.

660
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:43,250
Allow me to show it to you.

661
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,751
-Michaela.
-Hello, Charlie.

662
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,085
Does that superstar need rescuing?

663
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:57,583
Hey, Danny, shall we..?

664
00:40:57,667 --> 00:41:01,042
Michaela, think about what I said, yeah?

665
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,353
Hey, look, Danny,
your manager is here to save you.

666
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:08,633
I gotta take him away before you
three bears chew the meat off his bones.

667
00:41:10,731 --> 00:41:13,102
-Danny, take my hand.
-Danny, come on. Please.

668
00:41:14,444 --> 00:41:16,667
Danny, Danny, stay, come on.

669
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:19,501
We love you so much, Daniel, my man.

670
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,104
I love you, man.

671
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,083
Look, this beautiful pictures. Look.

672
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:26,876
<i>Dimitry, your tongue is hanging out
and you hand is on his cock.</i>

673
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:29,417
Danny, you should be proud of yourself.

674
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:33,959
Yeah, looks like we maybe going away
for the weekend with Greggy.

675
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:36,751
You guys have to stop doing this to me.

676
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:40,135
I don't know if that was
the most exhilarating moment of my life

677
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:42,083
or the most terrifying moment of my life.

678
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:47,167
But Danny Francesco playing
Danny Francesco, that is the way forward.

679
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:07,282
<i>Congratulations team,
a successful evening.</i>

680
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:08,708
<i>Debrief at 07.00.</i>

681
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,709
Good work.

682
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:13,751
<i>-Well, well, Greg...
-Well, Alexander.</i>

683
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:19,959
At your new improved summer sale price,
that is the 10 billion dollars.

684
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,542
-We have a deal.
-Fantastic.

685
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:28,375
So, who's buying?

686
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,501
<i>I'm not telling you that.</i>

687
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:35,959
My job is to protect
every link in this chain.

688
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:40,125
So, I do protect them, yes,
but I'm also protecting you.

689
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:44,501
So, what happens now is that I tell them
that you are delighted,

690
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:47,959
and they will be delighted,
and then we can all be delighted together.

691
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:51,542
-We should celebrate.
-We should.

692
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:55,751
Emilia! Get of them
really stupid bottles of vodka.

693
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:58,398
You know, the one
with a five carat rock in the top.

694
00:42:58,482 --> 00:43:00,162
-You'll love that.
<i>-Da.</i>

695
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:04,669
I do wish you communicate
with your other departments.

696
00:43:04,753 --> 00:43:07,667
Someone is feeding Mike information,
inside information.

697
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,501
<i>It doesn't look like Mike is working
for anyone in this government.</i>

698
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:15,667
I need more time to find out
which government he's working for.

699
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:17,959
Now, tell me what you have.

700
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:20,791
We still can't confirm it's the Handle,

701
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:23,096
what we do know is that Alexander
is selling something

702
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:24,542
for 10 billion dollars.

703
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:28,000
<i>-Greg Simmonds is brokering the deal.</i>
-And who's the buyer?

704
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:33,459
Still a mystery,
but it won't remain one for long.

705
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,042
<i>I think Orson is right.</i>

706
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:43,626
Greg has a thing for stealing girlfriends,
especially from movie stars.

707
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,916
So accept his offer to go away.

708
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,763
That's a vulnerable position.

709
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:50,456
I've dealt with much worse
than Greg Simmonds before, believe me.

710
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:51,626
Vulnerable?

711
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,542
Just be aware if they need to get out
quick it might not be that easy.

712
00:43:54,626 --> 00:43:56,781
At some point the movie star
is gonna melt.

713
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:58,064
I'm sure he'll be fine.

714
00:43:58,148 --> 00:43:59,667
What did you find on Trent and Arnold?

715
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:03,568
Our biotech billionaires are buying up
an awful lot of gold.

716
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:04,916
Other than that not a great deal.

717
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,813
At least we know
the Ukrainians are involved.

718
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:09,976
Whatever they're selling
has now got Greg very excited.

719
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,258
I found out where they're staying,
but their computers are impossible to hack

720
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:15,298
I don't know
how long it's gonna take me to get in.

721
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:17,417
Options?

722
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:20,667
Quickest way is to physically install
software on their computers.

723
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:24,127
You mean break in
and install via thumb drive?

724
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:26,208
Yes, that's the most direct way to do it.

725
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,046
This one's for you then.

726
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,834
Really? I thought I was a footman.

727
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,876
-No, tech-whizz.
-Yeah, and you're the hammer?

728
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:34,490
If there's a problem I'll do it.

729
00:44:34,574 --> 00:44:35,990
No, there's no problem, JJ.

730
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,916
I'll do it.

731
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,225
I can get inside the Ukrainians.

732
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:42,332
I hope you take them to dinner first.

733
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:46,626
Before you get inside of them.

734
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,375
sexually.

735
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,876
<i>You are over the wall. Neatly done.</i>

736
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,959
And we are redirecting air con.

737
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:25,751
And they're all sleeping like babies now.
They're not gonna wake up any time soon.

738
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:28,250
<i>You are safe to enter.</i>

739
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,626
<i>Doors are opening now.</i>

740
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,792
Up the stairs, first floor,
the bedroom on the left.

741
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,669
<i>Once you've installed the thumb drive</i>

742
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:02,667
<i>cover your tracks
and make it look like a robbery.</i>

743
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:07,459
<i>Swag some watches, cracketh the safe
and bag some cash, baby.</i>

744
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:11,042
<i>The more you bag the better it looks.</i>

745
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:31,626
<i>No time to watch TV, sweetheart.
Get to work.</i>

746
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:37,487
sub.T

747
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:22,449
<i>♪ Raindrops keep falling on my head ♪</i>

748
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:27,896
<i>♪ But that doesn't mean
my eyes will soon be turning red ♪</i>

749
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,291
<i>-Did you find the laptop?</i>
-Found.

750
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,667
Now I'd like you to plug in that drive
and slap Enter.

751
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:41,469
Whatever they control,
I can control better.

752
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:44,167
We have full access to their computer.

753
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:49,292
Now that you've sucked it dry,
return to safe.

754
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,667
There are still two guards patrolling.
Exit via the front door.

755
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,959
Nicely done, sweetheart.
We'll pick you up at the front gate.

756
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,751
Don't move!

757
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,792
Don't--

758
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:55,334
-What's that?
-It's a guard dog.

759
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:58,626
Guard. Dog.

760
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:01,959
-I'm good with a dog.
-Lucky them.

761
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:05,876
-What about your mate?
-Power nap. He'll be alright in a minute.

762
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:09,375
Are you guys done? I heard a gun shot.

763
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:14,667
-Is anyone dead?
-Nah, not thanks to you.

764
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,876
-What?
-You said it was clear.

765
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:20,417
-I said the front was clear.
-I came out of a front.

766
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:24,334
They usually keep the Olympic-size
swimming pools in the back of the house.

767
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:36,250
Front, back, right, wrong.

768
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:39,000
Whatever. Anyway, shall we?

769
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,891
-JJ.
-Sir.

770
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:50,333
-Morning.
-Morning.

771
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,375
-Sarah says I didn't miss much last night.
-In and out.

772
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:55,250
-So you weren't seen by anyone?
-Yes.

773
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:57,517
That's a "yes you weren't seen by anyone"?

774
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:58,458
Yes.

775
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,876
Or "yes you were seen by someone"?

776
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,083
-Yes.
-Childish.

777
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,147
Nothing you need to worry about, Nathan.

778
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,517
You just concentrate on your gluten-free
lactose intolerant

779
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:08,667
bunny stroking breakfast.

780
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:12,334
Boys, I pulled this off
the Ukrainian's laptop.

781
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:14,699
Looks like the deal's
all agreed to on their side

782
00:50:14,783 --> 00:50:16,875
and there's an escrow account linked.

783
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,542
-What are they selling?
-We still don't know.

784
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:22,501
-So we could be wasting our time.
-Activity on Greg's phone.

785
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:24,876
<i>-Yes?
-Greg, you're on speaker.</i>

786
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:28,501
I'm with Arnold, enjoying the view
from up here.

787
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:31,701
<i>You're back in Disneyland already?
Didn't know you're there, did you?*</i>

788
00:50:31,785 --> 00:50:33,708
What'd you do, beam yourselves, eh?

789
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:37,292
Don't go mad, darling,
yesterday I looked like a fucking candy.

790
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:41,916
You're lucky we made your party at all.
Your choice of friends is questionable.

791
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,625
You're not wrong, but I'd argue,
that they are acquaintances, not friends.

792
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:50,667
And yes, we did raise a lot of money
for the war orphans, thank you for caring.

793
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,590
Put a load of rich lowbrows
in a room together,

794
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,610
they'll always outbid one another

795
00:50:54,694 --> 00:50:57,542
in the name of egotistical competition
and ostentation.

796
00:50:57,626 --> 00:50:59,834
Which is kind of the point, Trent.

797
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:02,751
<i>Didn't have you down
as an angry anti-capitalist.</i>

798
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:07,292
We are anti-capitalists.
Anti other capitalists.

799
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,703
I'll tell you what, boys,
I've got another call coming in.

800
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:11,840
Thank you, my darling.

801
00:51:11,924 --> 00:51:13,125
<i>You better take it then.</i>

802
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:15,191
So, what was the point of this one?

803
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:18,623
-Just to check we're okay.
<i>-Yes, we are okay.</i>

804
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:22,125
<i>Just remember:
yellow is the color, and gold is the game.</i>

805
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:24,834
And I still love you. Will speak later.

806
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:27,874
-Hello, Qasim.
-Okay to talk?

807
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:28,916
<i>Go on.</i>

808
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,667
-I've just spoken to Aleksander.
-And? Everything set?

809
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,620
<i>It's not easy getting an answer
out of him.</i>

810
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:36,916
<i>-He's in a terrible mood.
-Why?</i>

811
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,518
You know he prides himself
on his security?

812
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:42,417
A lone cat burglar got in last night.

813
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:46,125
<i>Gassed the house.
Cleared out all his cash and jewelry.</i>

814
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:50,584
<i>On leaving, Alexander's personal guards
stopped him.</i>

815
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,459
Don't move!

816
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,834
I will shoot you!

817
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,886
Don't shoot! Don't hurt me.
Here are my hands.

818
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,916
Come on. Take my hands.

819
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,626
Hospitalized two of his guards.

820
00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:05,292
No police. No prison. I've got kids.

821
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,709
One with the broken nose,
three cracked ribs...

822
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,459
He's crying for mama, not a problem.

823
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:14,542
<i>And two fucked nuts.</i>

824
00:52:29,876 --> 00:52:31,751
Another one, a bullet in the foot.

825
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:33,375
You shot my foot!

826
00:52:34,876 --> 00:52:37,459
No cry for mama.

827
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,855
This is the kind of thing
I need to know about.

828
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,750
You dropped your chopsticks.
You got shit on your face.

829
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:47,542
<i>-Should I be worried?
-We are going to carry on.</i>

830
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:49,991
I'm waiting on confirmation.

831
00:52:50,075 --> 00:52:52,625
But they should be flying fowl
in 72 hours.

832
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:55,071
<i>-You keep me informed, Qasim.
-Will do.</i>

833
00:52:55,155 --> 00:52:56,667
<i>Golly, golly then.</i>

834
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:59,571
Flying fowl in 72 hours.
What the cust does that mean?*

835
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,125
I got a location on Qasim's phone.

836
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:03,767
If the Ukrainians are entering
another country illegally

837
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,750
they're gonna need help
avoiding any risks with the authorities.

838
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:11,916
-So where is this Qasim based?
-Antalya, Turkey.

839
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,054
Gobble, gobble.
That's flying fowl with a "w", not a "u."

840
00:53:16,138 --> 00:53:20,557
Turkey borders Ukraine,
hence flying fowl, flying to Turkey.

841
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,041
A bit overreach?

842
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:25,751
You'd think so,
except Qasim Amari is a diplomat,

843
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:28,535
located in the Turkish government
office in Antalya, Turkey.

844
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:29,750
I don't know how I do it.

845
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:34,250
-What a brain.
-Do I have a brain in there? She does.

846
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:37,375
Modern women,
what will they think of next?

847
00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:40,292
So, looks like we're all flying fowl.

848
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:42,583
We'll track Qasim, see where he leads us.

849
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:44,706
Sarah, you go with Danny as planned

850
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,015
and find out from Greg
exactly what it is he's buying.

851
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,375
We need a confirmation on that.

852
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:52,000
Explains why Greggy
is spending his weekend in Turkey.

853
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:02,334
There's a term for being beaten
in four moves, Nathan.

854
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:06,250
-Fool's mate.
-It wasn't four moves.

855
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:09,082
If you can get yourself out
of that little mess I've put you in

856
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,958
you can have a glass of this.

857
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:14,049
What do we got on Qasim, JJ?

858
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:16,375
Libya and therefore
based all over the world.*

859
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:20,125
Met Greg Simmonds in the 2000s,
he put him on a payroll soon after.

860
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:24,292
Qasim's been greasing palms
and burying bodies for Greg ever since.

861
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:28,626
-Nice one, have a glass of this.
-Wine is not really my thing.

862
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:33,542
-Is that the 2004?
-You still in here? Aren't you busy enough?

863
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:37,138
-There's wine, and then there's wine.
-Don't force the poor man.

864
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:48,660
Congratulations, Doctor Frankenstein.
You've created another monster.

865
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:52,584
Nathan, you don't put fish oil
in a Ferrari.*

866
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:18,092
Little Miss Paradox...
She got in your head yet?

867
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,966
-Hey. Good to see you.
-You too.

868
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,291
There they are, my new best friends.

869
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:28,042
<i>Hosgeldiniz</i>, as we say in Turkey.

870
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:32,334
-Thank you for the jet.
-Don't be silly, that's the baby one.

871
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:35,042
-Danny Francesco.
-It's good to see you, Greg.

872
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,522
Excited to be here,
to learn from the master.

873
00:55:37,606 --> 00:55:40,125
No, I'm not the master.

874
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:44,279
Before we do anything else, follow me
cause I have something to show you.

875
00:55:44,363 --> 00:55:45,420
Grab a drink on a way.

876
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:48,695
75 Corniche, Greggy, I love it.

877
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:51,156
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
Present from Elton that one.

878
00:55:53,212 --> 00:55:55,637
What a second, that looks exactly
like the car that I drove--

879
00:55:55,721 --> 00:55:57,251
Do you know why? Do you know why?

880
00:55:58,626 --> 00:56:02,459
-That's not possible.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it is.

881
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:05,584
Lovingly restored with me own hands.

882
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:08,736
It's not really with me own hands,
I'm just joking.

883
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,516
It's nice though, isn't it?

884
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,959
Look at him!

885
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,709
-I drove this car myself.
-I know, honey.

886
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,818
And, Michaela did his own stunts.

887
00:56:19,902 --> 00:56:21,166
-Is that true, Danny?
-Yeah.

888
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,709
-Could you still do them?
-I'm a little rusty, but sure.

889
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:27,792
Right, game on! After lunch, yes?

890
00:56:27,876 --> 00:56:31,334
Okay, I might have to sit that one out,
but you boys have fun.

891
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:34,482
After lunch, Michaela
you are having the pleasure

892
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:38,792
of a four hands hot stones massage
with Suki and Sasha.

893
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:43,136
And they really, really understand
a lady's geography.

894
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,685
-Isn't that right, Emilia?
-Yes, they do.

895
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,209
Sounds fabulous.

896
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:50,542
-She looks nervous.
-Believe me, I'm not.

897
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:52,242
You even have my prop gun!

898
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,606
Yeah, but it's not a prop anymore,
Danny, so steady there...

899
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,466
I cannot believe you got this car.

900
00:56:58,556 --> 00:57:00,798
-I wanted this car so bad.
-Did you?

901
00:57:02,006 --> 00:57:03,334
How much did you want it, Danny?

902
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:08,292
Of all the cars I've driven on screen,
this the only car I wanted to possess.

903
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:11,918
-Is that right, did you crave it?
-Yeah.

904
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,292
-Did you yearn for it?
-Yeah.

905
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:17,918
-Did you dream about it?
-I longed for it.

906
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:21,920
Do you know what? It's yours.
Come, let's have lunch.

907
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:26,959
-What?
-It's yours.

908
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,626
Come on!

909
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,876
-Alright.
-Do you like kebabs?

910
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:39,150
-What's in the bag?
-Nothing.

911
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:41,542
So you're carrying an empty bag?

912
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:44,751
-You nicked the Margaux, didn't you?
-Nicked is a little bit strong.

913
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:47,193
We're leaving half the bottle
of Margaux on a plane?

914
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:48,453
So you're the doggie bag man?

915
00:57:48,537 --> 00:57:49,953
Do you have any idea what it costs?

916
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:53,333
He has no idea how much it costs.
Short arms, long pockets.

917
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,792
Room keys.

918
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:58,209
Be down here in 60 minutes.
We have to track the Libyan.

919
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:01,859
What are you doing? That's my key.

920
00:58:01,943 --> 00:58:04,583
I know it is. I also know
you've given yourself the biggest room.

921
00:58:04,673 --> 00:58:07,391
How do you know
I haven't already switched them?

922
00:58:07,475 --> 00:58:10,664
Fuck off, Nathan.
You haven't got a pair of wits for that.*

923
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:16,458
I can't believe it.
I'm in the car with the actor.

924
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:18,904
Is the back end still bulletproof?
It feels a little squirrly.

925
00:58:18,988 --> 00:58:20,708
Oh, yeah, you need selling points.

926
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:24,667
Tell me, how did the leap from
millionaire to billionaire changed you.

927
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,583
Right, interesting question.

928
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:31,083
And I imagine, my cue to say money
doesn't make you happier.

929
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:34,375
But I'll tell you what, Danny.
It fucking does.

930
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:38,751
It does. I'm really happy now.
And a nicer person too.

931
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:42,292
I worry about things, I worry about
the world, I worry about war orphans.

932
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:45,334
You don't strike me as a worrier, Greg.

933
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:48,709
You don't strike me as someone
who drives like a little girly, but you do.

934
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,375
Oh, is that how it is?

935
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:58,834
Slow down, Danny Francesco!
You're driving me into my dreams!

936
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,459
Everything alright, Michaela?

937
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:29,167
Yeah, oh, my God, this place is massive.

938
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:35,250
And wow, this piece is beautiful.
"Mimar Sinan."

939
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:38,042
-Are you looking for your room?
-Yes!

940
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:42,000
-My room is... that way.
-It's actually the other way.

941
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,482
Of course.

942
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:46,333
Down the corridor turn right
and it's on your left.

943
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,959
That massage was so good, by the way.
You should join us next time.

944
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:53,910
-Turn right.
-Right. Got it.

945
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:55,667
Okay, I'll see you later.

946
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:10,083
-Qasim zapped.*
-Do we follow him?

947
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:12,918
Not yet.

948
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Looks like he's en route for a coffee.

949
01:00:22,709 --> 01:00:26,959
-Oh, hello. How does he do it?*
-Mike?

950
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:29,294
Doesn't matter how he's done it.
He's done it.

951
01:00:29,378 --> 01:00:30,500
It's Mike, isn't it?

952
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:32,501
How's he getting his information?

953
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:35,959
<i>-Ground control.</i>
-Can you hear me, Major Tom?

954
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,918
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

955
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,918
<i>-How are we getting on?</i>
-Looping monitor...

956
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,430
They have some of adolescent firewall.

957
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:47,339
It'll take me
about a minute to perforate it.

958
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:49,631
Done.

959
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,375
It's like he's got enough of that paper.
Qasim's off and Mike's going with him.

960
01:00:57,459 --> 01:01:00,918
-Are we following?
-No, let Mike play that game.

961
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,533
-My money's on the paper.
-Whatever you say, boss.

962
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:05,760
Want an ice cream?

963
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:17,792
-And I am in.
-Great.

964
01:01:17,876 --> 01:01:20,334
-What's he buying?
-Hold on.

965
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:24,792
I've picked up a file sent by Qasim.
He's using RSA encryption.

966
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:29,792
-That's disappointing.
<i>-What?</i>

967
01:01:29,876 --> 01:01:36,125
It looks like Greg's up to no good. But...
Not spectacularly no good, just no good.

968
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:38,469
Don't be mean, Sarah, give me something.

969
01:01:38,553 --> 01:01:41,417
Greg is buying
containers of stolen AK-47s.

970
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:44,055
Yes, very funny.
Now seriously, what is it?

971
01:01:44,149 --> 01:01:45,333
I am serious.

972
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:48,334
We've got it wrong. See for yourself.

973
01:01:56,459 --> 01:01:59,292
Oh, hello. We've seen him before.

974
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:05,459
-Shall we?
-I get the ice creams, you get the wheel.

975
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:10,584
<i>Can't be, Sarah. All that fuss
over 30 million dollars worth of guns?</i>

976
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:12,375
<i>It's too small of a crime
for two bigger players.</i>

977
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:14,371
<i>If it's a cover it's a very good one.</i>

978
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:17,208
<i>It's enough evidence to feel his collar,
but not enough to choke him with it.</i>

979
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:22,167
Understood, but there is nothing
linking this deal to the Handle.

980
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,292
Poo. Alright, get out of there
and get back as soon as you can.

981
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,011
Let me just dig a bit deeper

982
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,958
and find some evidence
we can hold over him for a rainy day.

983
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,209
<i>Okay, but be quick.</i>

984
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:36,375
-Orson, you there?
<i>-What is it?</i>

985
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:38,501
Time to come in. We were wrong.

986
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:41,727
It's not the Handle, it's fire arms.
We're following the wrong rabbit.

987
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,792
You go back to bed, leave this with me.

988
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:47,167
Sarah showed me proof.
Forget it. We're done.

989
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:52,125
I don't think so. We're back
with our old friend, Ben Harris.

990
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:56,584
If Greg has Ben involved, there's no way
that this deal is about guns.

991
01:02:56,667 --> 01:03:01,417
<i>Alright, follow him, but do not engage.
I'll let Sarah know we're still in play.</i>

992
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:16,248
<i>-You got me, JJ?</i>
-I've got a lock on you, boss.

993
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:29,834
<i>-Do we pick him up?</i>
-No, cat follows mouse.

994
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:45,125
<i>-Can you get a lock onto his phone?</i>
-Yeah, if you get close enough.

995
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:49,279
<i>Stay within 50 meters, I can use
your phone to lock onto his signal.</i>

996
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,667
Quicker if he uses it.

997
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:52,727
Get close enough to raise suspicion.

998
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:54,739
<i>But not too close.*</i>

999
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:57,310
<i>That'll initiate him activating his phone.</i>

1000
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:03,584
Are we being followed?

1001
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:08,167
BAD SMELL BEHIND ME

1002
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,083
<i>He's sent a text. I've blocked it.</i>

1003
01:04:13,514 --> 01:04:17,430
I've got him. I've locked on.
I've blocked his call.

1004
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:21,083
Can't get through. No signal.

1005
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:27,334
-Deal with that.
-Yes, sir.

1006
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:32,584
-Are you lost?
-Thank you, sir. Maybe you can help me.

1007
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:36,834
-I'm looking for the harbor.
-This way, sir.

1008
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,584
<i>Hang on,
I've just jammed another message.</i>

1009
01:04:46,209 --> 01:04:50,000
We're burned.
He's recognized you.

1010
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,876
That's strange...

1011
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:57,876
Because according to the map,
it says this way.

1012
01:04:57,959 --> 01:05:00,542
No, this way, sir.

1013
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:08,501
Amazing, you're absolutely right.
Thank you.

1014
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,000
You've gotta pick him up. He's gonna run.

1015
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:41,504
<i>Orson, if he gets out of the range
I can't block his signal.</i>

1016
01:05:41,588 --> 01:05:42,485
<i>Get after him.</i>

1017
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:55,000
<i>He's in the building on the left.</i>

1018
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:06,542
<i>He's 10 meters straight in front of you.</i>

1019
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:18,554
JJ, he's on two wheels, talk to me.

1020
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:20,188
Fifteen meters. Take a right.

1021
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:32,400
-Left or right, JJ?
-Sharp left.

1022
01:06:32,484 --> 01:06:33,718
He's getting out of range.

1023
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:01,035
<i>JJ, speak to me.</i>

1024
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,455
He's stopped moving.
He's right in front of you.

1025
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:12,250
-Missed him. Stairs?
<i>-Take a right.</i>

1026
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,417
Afternoon.

1027
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:33,660
Excuse me, would you take
a picture of me and the view?

1028
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,022
They're only stairs,
go on, move yourself.

1029
01:07:38,106 --> 01:07:40,083
<i>Next time I'll sit in the car,
you do the chase.</i>

1030
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,501
Let me take a look.

1031
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:49,000
Beautiful. Give me your phone,
let me take one for you.

1032
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:52,667
He's still there.

1033
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,720
There's no one here.

1034
01:08:03,804 --> 01:08:07,767
<i>I'm telling you he's right there.
You're on top of his phone now.</i>

1035
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,125
Oh, Jesus, what'd you do that for?

1036
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:13,542
<i>Hold on, I'm just pulling up.</i>

1037
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:18,250
There is a body all over the floor
200 feet below me. It's Harris.

1038
01:08:18,334 --> 01:08:24,042
Get the phone, the paper.
And get the body in the back.

1039
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:33,083
-That's not Ben Harris.
-What you mean that's not Ben Harris?

1040
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:42,542
That's Ben Harris.

1041
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,167
-Is he in the back?
-Yeah, he's in the back.

1042
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,834
<i>So, Nathan, can you confirm?</i>

1043
01:09:04,876 --> 01:09:07,792
The file Sarah extracted
from Greg's computer

1044
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:10,941
was actually the data key
that unlocked the Bakker drive,

1045
01:09:11,025 --> 01:09:12,708
confirming it is the Handle.

1046
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:17,334
-So what is it?
-It's a first of its kind programmable AI.

1047
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:21,083
Our people had hoped
it was still in the post.

1048
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:24,250
Now it seems the post has been delivered.

1049
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:27,834
It can hack any system,
even other AI programs.

1050
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:29,959
-With what end?
<i>-To any end.</i>

1051
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:31,809
It could launch a nuclear strike

1052
01:09:31,893 --> 01:09:35,875
and then cover its own tracks pointing
the finger at whomever it wants to blame.

1053
01:09:35,959 --> 01:09:40,250
<i>Whatever is run by a computer
it can control.</i>

1054
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:44,667
And we still don't know
what they intend to use it for.

1055
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,187
<i>Yes, but we can at least now confirm</i>

1056
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:48,583
<i>that Aleksander
is indeed selling the Handle</i>

1057
01:09:48,674 --> 01:09:52,010
<i>with Greg Simmonds brokering
the deal for 10 billion dollars.</i>

1058
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:53,981
Confirmed.

1059
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:55,500
Sir, what now?

1060
01:09:55,584 --> 01:09:59,083
-When the transaction is gonna take place?
-Deal's set for 9 a.m.

1061
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,000
Between the newspaper
and info extracted from his phone.

1062
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:06,846
<i>Ben Harris was to be picked up
from Hotel Amara's lobby</i>

1063
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,916
<i>by Alexander's representative.</i>

1064
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,626
<i>And taken to the exchange
to transfer the escrow.</i>

1065
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,209
But he still needs to call Greg
to get a 15-digit passcode.

1066
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:20,417
So, inconveniently
we do still need Ben Harris.

1067
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:22,916
Could've done without him dying,
but still.

1068
01:10:23,003 --> 01:10:24,250
Childish.

1069
01:10:24,334 --> 01:10:27,667
-Can we make me Ben Harris?
-Go on.

1070
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:29,700
They don't know what he looks like.

1071
01:10:29,794 --> 01:10:33,041
<i>He guarded his visual identity
very closely.</i>

1072
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,566
<i>-Mr. Harris?</i>
-Yes.

1073
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:39,017
<i>There is a green G-wagon outside.
My men will escort you.</i>

1074
01:10:40,834 --> 01:10:42,659
I'll do the deal myself.

1075
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:45,459
But you'll have to talk
to Greg on the phone.

1076
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:59,667
It's a pleasure to meet with you,
Mr. Harris. Your phone, please.

1077
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:05,667
-Anything else?
-Nothing else.

1078
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:10,000
-Do you mind?
-Please.

1079
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:20,302
I can make you look like him
but I can't make you sound like him.

1080
01:11:20,386 --> 01:11:21,709
Don't we know someone who can?

1081
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:26,876
I'll tell you what, Danny, Michaela,
it's a gift. It is a gift.

1082
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:29,532
My dad had it.
It's like a party trick for him.

1083
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:32,708
Didn't matter what it was.
Could be a toy, could be a pair of shoes.

1084
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:36,208
He could put his hand on it,
shut his eyes and tell you the price.

1085
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,792
He'd do $14.99.

1086
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,442
He could. He could do that.

1087
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:42,143
Please don't stop on my account.
I have to use a little girls room.

1088
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,209
Yes, my darling,
you know where it is, don't you?

1089
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:49,250
Yes, it's straight past Mimar Sinan
and right at Timur.

1090
01:11:50,709 --> 01:11:52,876
-She's funny isn't she?
-She's great.

1091
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:53,989
You are very lucky.

1092
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:56,963
Right, so roof comes down.
Watch this. Roof comes down.

1093
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:01,274
You say: "Relax, relax Mr. Steak."

1094
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:02,934
There, he is all calm now.

1095
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:10,393
<i>Sarah, regrettably
Ben Harris has passed away.</i>

1096
01:12:10,477 --> 01:12:12,041
-When?
<i>-Couple of hours ago.</i>

1097
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:15,056
<i>Orson encouraged him to jump off
an extremely tall building.</i>

1098
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:15,999
Poor guy.

1099
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:17,766
<i>Can you make him sound like Harris?</i>

1100
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,786
Have you sourced
any existing voice recordings?

1101
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,041
<i>Yes.</i>

1102
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:24,222
In which case upload them and send
them to me and I can do that.

1103
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:25,125
<i>How?</i>

1104
01:12:25,209 --> 01:12:27,455
-The vocoder works in real time.
<i>-Clever.</i>

1105
01:12:27,648 --> 01:12:28,817
That's AI for you, Nathan.

1106
01:12:28,901 --> 01:12:29,904
<i>One last thing...</i>

1107
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:33,331
<i>I need you to confirm you still have
full access to Aleksander's network?</i>

1108
01:12:35,459 --> 01:12:36,876
Confirmed.

1109
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:43,334
Make yourself comfortable.
There is water in the door.

1110
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:12,959
-So far, so good.
-Okay. Keep in touch, JJ.

1111
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,698
Now, you two, you're gonna
have to entertain yourselves for an hour.

1112
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:17,166
Cause I gotta make a work call.

1113
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:20,372
That's right. I guess I could use
a little nappy poo myself, so...

1114
01:13:20,456 --> 01:13:22,875
-I'll join you for your nappy poo.
-Yeah?

1115
01:13:22,959 --> 01:13:25,918
Change of plan.
Danny, you make the work call.

1116
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,737
I'll take the nappy poo.
Michaela, you join me.

1117
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,327
Greggy...

1118
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:38,792
They're going off road. I'm parking up.

1119
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:05,626
He's the real deal.
He's supper impressive.

1120
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:08,125
And he's so into you.

1121
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:10,574
I mean, if you're not interested
in him I might be.

1122
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:12,708
Fill your boots.

1123
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:13,944
What are you doing?

1124
01:14:14,028 --> 01:14:16,625
I need to make Orson
sound like Greg's lawyer.

1125
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:18,167
Why?

1126
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,417
Because Ben Harris is dead
and we need him alive for the arms deal.

1127
01:14:21,501 --> 01:14:24,422
Ben Harris is dead? When did that happen?
And who killed him?

1128
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,204
That's not something
you need to worry about.

1129
01:14:26,288 --> 01:14:28,999
What you need to worry is how much
longer we have until we're found out.

1130
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:30,579
Found out?

1131
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:35,042
I know you're having a billionaire
love affair. It's very sweet.

1132
01:14:35,132 --> 01:14:36,244
But we have about 20 minutes

1133
01:14:36,328 --> 01:14:39,396
before Greg's security
blows our fucking brains out.

1134
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:42,779
What do I do?

1135
01:14:42,863 --> 01:14:44,999
I suggest you get ready
for your next scene.

1136
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,501
-Which is?
-The getaway.

1137
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:51,459
Right. I know how to do that. Action time.

1138
01:14:51,543 --> 01:14:52,834
Right.

1139
01:14:52,918 --> 01:14:55,125
-I'll see you in the garage.
-Okay, darling.

1140
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:17,459
They will be here soon.

1141
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:28,792
I'm on.

1142
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:08,000
-Sergi.
-Boss.

1143
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:12,959
<i>I'm in place.</i>

1144
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,918
Mr. Harris, I assume?

1145
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:21,626
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Likewise.

1146
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:28,959
Here we are.

1147
01:16:31,243 --> 01:16:34,085
<i>Your people have confirmed
that the product is authentic.</i>

1148
01:16:34,176 --> 01:16:35,726
<i>I present the Handle.</i>

1149
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,918
I need my phone.

1150
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,726
Yes, Benjamin bunny.

1151
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,546
Mr. Simmonds, we're connected.

1152
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:02,083
-Alright.
-We're good.

1153
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:09,250
The 15-digit passcode.

1154
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:13,501
A moment of privacy please.

1155
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:16,916
-Emilia...
-What is it?

1156
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,959
There seems to be some sort
of break in on our internet security.

1157
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:23,850
<i>Just waiting for the system
to go online.</i>

1158
01:17:23,934 --> 01:17:25,125
Hold in.

1159
01:17:25,209 --> 01:17:27,876
I've been trying to make it for days.*

1160
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:30,751
It's like someone hacked in
but keep dropping in and out.

1161
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:32,580
Who's hacking in?

1162
01:17:32,734 --> 01:17:35,149
The signal is coming
from within the compound.

1163
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,959
Ready for the 15-digit code.

1164
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:42,167
Right, here we go.

1165
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,223
<i>Two, six, two.</i>

1166
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,876
<i>Harris is transferring now, stand by.</i>

1167
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:50,834
-Update.
-It's happening.

1168
01:17:50,918 --> 01:17:52,876
Put it here...*

1169
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,650
Check the monitors, show me where.

1170
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:56,750
The signal's bouncing all around
the server, I can't lock it down.

1171
01:17:56,834 --> 01:18:01,250
<i>Squiggly dash, eight, five...</i>

1172
01:18:01,334 --> 01:18:02,465
<i>Nine.</i>

1173
01:18:02,549 --> 01:18:04,584
Small letter "b" for bullocks...

1174
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:09,167
<i>Five, six...</i>

1175
01:18:10,334 --> 01:18:13,375
<i>Five, five, comma...</i>

1176
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:16,501
Big "c" for clit.

1177
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:24,000
-It happened.
<i>-Ponytail, 11 o'clock.</i>

1178
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:28,000
Show me Greg's office.
I know Greg's in there. Why is it empty?

1179
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,535
-Got it?
<i>-All done.</i>

1180
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:30,750
Transaction complete.

1181
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:34,584
Ben, hurry home,
don't talk to strangers.

1182
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:41,501
Check all communication in and out
of the villa in the past 24 hours.

1183
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:45,417
<i>-He doesn't like you.
-It's the guard from the villa.</i>

1184
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:49,250
<i>-I'm on him.</i>
-Payment confirmed.

1185
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:55,959
-Ten billion. Confirmed.
-Confirmed.

1186
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:59,125
<i>-Mazel tov</i>
-Confirmed.

1187
01:18:59,209 --> 01:19:02,042
Ponytail's lodging a complaint.

1188
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:05,417
<i>-Thank you, Mr. Harris.</i>
-Stop!

1189
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:07,542
This is not Ben Harris!

1190
01:19:07,626 --> 01:19:09,334
Helicopters! Incoming.

1191
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:12,501
-Shoot him!
-JJ?

1192
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:42,125
<i>-Sarah, update.</i>
-I'm just unconfirming their confirmation.

1193
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:46,000
-What's happening?
-It was confirmed!

1194
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:03,375
JJ, who are these people? Find out.

1195
01:20:03,459 --> 01:20:06,125
-Give me a moment.
<i>-Thirty seconds!</i>

1196
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:09,792
-I don't understand...
-What don't you understand?

1197
01:20:09,876 --> 01:20:11,751
It's gone.

1198
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:27,521
Just don't tell me it's Mike.

1199
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:29,775
<i>Understood. Then I won't.</i>

1200
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:34,000
-Who is it?
-I'm not allowed to tell you.

1201
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:37,709
Fuck! Give me that fucking radio!

1202
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:40,515
-I have Orson under control.
-Get that gun out of my face.

1203
01:20:40,599 --> 01:20:42,750
Give me the fucking radio!

1204
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:47,000
-Are you up there in the chopper, Mike?
-Orson, you sound upset.

1205
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:50,292
Don't you worry about me, Mike,
I'm having a lovely time.

1206
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:52,918
What seems to be the problem,
engine trouble?

1207
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,626
<i>Don't concern yourself.
I'll give you the busfare home.</i>

1208
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:58,417
My boys will take over from here.

1209
01:21:03,918 --> 01:21:05,834
Come on...

1210
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:10,709
Who are you?

1211
01:21:12,918 --> 01:21:14,709
Who are you, Michaela?

1212
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,459
How did you do it?

1213
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,417
This thing between us.

1214
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:26,667
Is strong, innit?

1215
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:31,209
Do you know what the Turks call it?
<i>Kivilcim.</i> It means fire.

1216
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,403
<i>They say the gods would be furious
if you put it out.</i>

1217
01:21:35,502 --> 01:21:37,083
<i>But you know what I'm gonna do.</i>

1218
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:40,806
I'm going to put it out, Michaela
because of Danny.

1219
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,999
He's a friend and I respect him.

1220
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:48,250
And it's the right thing to do.
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.

1221
01:21:49,766 --> 01:21:52,792
No, it's fine. I'll see you at dinner.

1222
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:06,209
Find any survivors. Tie them up,
beat them up, bring them here.

1223
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:09,125
I will be back in the air asap.

1224
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:15,918
Orson, you know why I'm here. Let's not
make this any messier than it needs to be.

1225
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,876
So don't be a bad girl.
Just surrender my prize.

1226
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:22,417
You want it so bad, you get your ass
down here and get it yourself.

1227
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:26,585
I have people to do that for me.

1228
01:22:26,669 --> 01:22:30,041
Ah, here he is.
Keeping a safe distance as usual?

1229
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:32,145
You're a spineless, jellyfish Mike.

1230
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:34,417
-Yatom, get the case.
-I'm on it.

1231
01:22:34,501 --> 01:22:39,792
Go on, it's yours. You're not taking it.
I'm giving it to you.

1232
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,959
What the heck? What's this?

1233
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,292
-He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
-It's okay. Relax, relax.

1234
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,042
Oh, it's a selfie! Okay!

1235
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,918
Who is gonna tell me what's going on?

1236
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,439
We think they hacked into
our secure server.

1237
01:22:59,523 --> 01:23:00,999
It's not that secure then, is it?

1238
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,630
It's worse than that I'm afraid.

1239
01:23:02,714 --> 01:23:05,243
Whoever you think you were
on the phone to before you weren't.

1240
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:10,021
<i>-Ready for the 15-digit passcode.</i>
-What are you on about, that's Ben.

1241
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:12,250
<i>Ready for the 15-digit passcode.</i>

1242
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:16,023
You stop Danny Francesco
and whoever the fuck that is. Do it now!

1243
01:23:16,107 --> 01:23:16,958
Do it now!

1244
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:20,542
-Get after that car. Bring them back to me!
<i>-Understood.</i>

1245
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:32,751
-We good?
-Yes, we got it.

1246
01:23:32,834 --> 01:23:34,584
Check the case, John.

1247
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:44,439
You have the case,
so why are we on our knees?

1248
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,333
You won't be on your knees
for long, my friend.

1249
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:50,918
Orson, there's something strange
going on up here.

1250
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,167
-It's good, boss.
-Good.

1251
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,975
The temperature's changed.

1252
01:24:09,059 --> 01:24:12,009
<i>Mike's gone rogue,
he's executed the Ukrainian.</i>

1253
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:17,709
-We got what we need, Connors?
-Yes, boss.

1254
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,250
Kill Orson.

1255
01:24:21,709 --> 01:24:24,501
-They're gonna kill you now.
-Shoot them first then.

1256
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:36,709
I'm not just good with dogs.

1257
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:41,959
Tardy.

1258
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:44,125
There's a chopper
with a dead pilot up here.

1259
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:46,125
-I'll meet you there.
-Incoming.

1260
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:47,958
<i>-Nathan?</i>
-Yes.

1261
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,437
<i>Nathan, we're being chased
by Greg's security.</i>

1262
01:24:50,521 --> 01:24:52,744
Then get unchased.

1263
01:24:54,972 --> 01:24:58,931
Good news, the back is bulletproof,
bad news, I can't control the back end.

1264
01:25:06,626 --> 01:25:10,667
-You any good in one of these?
-It's been a while.

1265
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:14,918
But I'll feel my way. It's only a chopper.

1266
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:21,042
Feeling my way.

1267
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,751
You think you could put your foot down?

1268
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:42,167
-What are you gonna do with that?
-I'm gonna shoot at them, Danny.

1269
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,584
I think I can help you out with that.

1270
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,751
I'm outta bullets.

1271
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:05,167
<i>-Nathan, are you there?</i>
-Yes. What is it?

1272
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:08,100
Your friend Mike appeared again,
but this time he's turned.

1273
01:26:08,184 --> 01:26:09,125
Turned?

1274
01:26:09,209 --> 01:26:12,009
<i>He's executed the Ukrainians
and taken the AI.</i>

1275
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:14,263
Going after him in a chopper.

1276
01:26:19,626 --> 01:26:21,369
<i>Did the other two get out okay?</i>

1277
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:24,551
Don't worry about them.
They can take care of themselves.

1278
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:29,000
The road's closed!

1279
01:26:36,709 --> 01:26:37,642
<i>What happened?</i>

1280
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:40,241
Cover's blown, Greg's security
are in pursuit.

1281
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,291
You just focus on retrieving
the case from Mike.

1282
01:26:42,375 --> 01:26:47,584
-Find out where they are.
-Already on it. Two minutes south west.

1283
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:15,000
They're going in the tunnel.

1284
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:24,688
Do you know how to use
these rocket launchers?

1285
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:26,792
Can't be too complicated.

1286
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:29,459
F for forward, R for rocket.

1287
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:33,334
I think we're in trouble here.

1288
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:36,667
Oops.

1289
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:47,364
I think R is for rear.

1290
01:27:47,448 --> 01:27:50,458
I think I've worked that out now,
thank you, JJ.

1291
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:53,417
Let's hope there's two more seats
in that chopper.

1292
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:04,563
Knighton has confirmed,
Mike is not working for any government.

1293
01:28:04,647 --> 01:28:05,958
He's been working independently.

1294
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:09,792
-Ain't that a surprise?
<i>-You need to track him down.</i>

1295
01:28:09,876 --> 01:28:12,982
You track him down,
we're going back to Greg's.

1296
01:28:13,066 --> 01:28:14,325
-We are?
-You are?

1297
01:28:14,409 --> 01:28:18,250
-We are?
-We are? I can't go back to Greg's.

1298
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:22,786
Danny, nothing to worry about,
JJ is taking care of you.

1299
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:23,834
Sit down, Danny.

1300
01:28:23,918 --> 01:28:26,612
You might wanna see Greg
but I don't think Greg wants to see you.

1301
01:28:26,696 --> 01:28:28,074
<i>That's where you're wrong, Nathan.</i>

1302
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:30,083
I am exactly who he wants to see.

1303
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,666
He knows Sarah downloaded
enough information on him

1304
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,125
to throw away the key.

1305
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:37,209
I'll find some evidence
we can hold over him for a rainy day.

1306
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:40,209
So, Greg now works for us.

1307
01:28:40,292 --> 01:28:44,141
JJ, tell Greg we're coming in.
We have an offer he can't refuse.

1308
01:28:44,225 --> 01:28:45,875
He'd be expecting the call.

1309
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:50,667
-Whatever you say, boss.
-Can we drop me off first?

1310
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:54,417
Nothing to worry about, Danny.
Greg's in love with you.

1311
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:56,890
-Would you buckle up?
-Sit down, Danny.

1312
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:34,166
If you are wondering
whether I'm feeling something of a tit,

1313
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,375
the answer is yes, I am.

1314
01:29:36,459 --> 01:29:39,167
-Is it humiliating, Emilia?
-Yes.

1315
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,767
Do we still think
we can maybe make a deal?

1316
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:43,125
-Yes.
-Yes, we do.

1317
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:46,961
Which is not to take away
from the genius of your plan,

1318
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:48,625
Orson Fortune.

1319
01:29:48,709 --> 01:29:51,209
That is a sexy name. It is.

1320
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:55,334
You must fancy him a bit.
Fake Michaela...

1321
01:29:56,214 --> 01:29:58,918
I still fancy you a bit.

1322
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,532
But what you've done using him as bait.

1323
01:30:03,616 --> 01:30:06,875
Celebrity Trojan horse.
That's brilliant. It's classy.

1324
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:11,292
Not so classy though
is your competitor, Mike,

1325
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:15,083
comes barreling in,
pretending to be mister law in order.

1326
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:19,834
Steals your thunder
and potentially my commission.

1327
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:25,250
-You can keep your commission, Gregory.
-Oh yeah?

1328
01:30:25,334 --> 01:30:29,630
Oh, yeah. You can keep your commission,
you can keep your reputation,

1329
01:30:29,714 --> 01:30:31,125
your liberty...

1330
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:33,545
Because you're gonna donate
your said commission

1331
01:30:33,629 --> 01:30:35,879
to your favorite charity, Orphans of War.

1332
01:30:38,918 --> 01:30:41,125
Oh... Am I?

1333
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:46,584
-Who's your buyer, Greg?
-I never reveal my buyers, Orson.

1334
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:52,125
-Emilia, tell them.
-You remember Trent and Arnold?

1335
01:30:52,209 --> 01:30:55,626
Would you care to meet Trent and Arnold.

1336
01:30:55,709 --> 01:30:58,083
-The biotech billionaire friends?
-Yeah, that's it.

1337
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:03,209
As we speak they are using
your precious programmable AI

1338
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:06,228
the Handle, I believe you call it,

1339
01:31:06,312 --> 01:31:08,625
in conjunction
with a concept of satellites.

1340
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:11,792
Enjoying the view from up here.

1341
01:31:11,876 --> 01:31:15,626
Purpose - to trip up
the world's banking system.

1342
01:31:15,709 --> 01:31:18,411
So that's why they're buying up
40 billion dollars worth of gold

1343
01:31:18,495 --> 01:31:21,875
while simultaneously
trying to cover their tracks?

1344
01:31:21,959 --> 01:31:23,051
That's exactly it, Orson.

1345
01:31:23,135 --> 01:31:24,234
By the time they are finished

1346
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:27,291
gold is the only thing
you'll be able to buy a sticky book with.

1347
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:30,552
-You're taking us there, Greg.
-I could.

1348
01:31:30,636 --> 01:31:32,298
And I reckon
I can get through the door

1349
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:35,317
because I've got something
they can't ignore,

1350
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:38,083
namely a comprehensive insurance policy.

1351
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:41,209
But I do worry about your invitation.

1352
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:45,000
Trent and Arnold have rented themselves
a very nasty little private army.

1353
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:47,042
You let me worry about that.

1354
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,626
Just one last thing.

1355
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:56,584
I would kill to see you in action.

1356
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:00,292
Oh, Danny...

1357
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:03,083
How can I say no?

1358
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:13,918
So, what are they going to do
with this Handle?

1359
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,709
The Handle would be
a financial atomic bomb.

1360
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:22,147
<i>It will create a digital glitch
in a world's banking system.</i>

1361
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,875
<i>May last only a few minutes,</i>

1362
01:32:23,959 --> 01:32:28,042
<i>but that will be enough for trust
to evaporate in conventional markets.</i>

1363
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,681
Gold will, like always...

1364
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:35,547
would be the only remaining currency
with any credibility.

1365
01:32:35,631 --> 01:32:38,209
Its value rising exponentially.

1366
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:42,959
Anarchy would follow
while the world reorganizes itself.

1367
01:32:44,042 --> 01:32:49,209
Well, Nathan... now it's time
for your man to prove his worth.

1368
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:55,792
Clear the room.

1369
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:58,042
-Anita.
-Yes, Mr. Knighton.

1370
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,250
Get the PM on the line.

1371
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:14,209
And the bird is up.
We'll have eyes soon.

1372
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:20,083
<i>And Greg and Danny have arrived.</i>

1373
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:27,459
The floor is yours. Method?

1374
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:31,417
Blitzkrieg.
Get them before they count the first body.

1375
01:33:31,501 --> 01:33:33,626
I like it.

1376
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:38,834
-I'll cover you. There are blind spots.
-That's what the birds for, JJ.

1377
01:33:38,918 --> 01:33:42,417
JJ... shoot straight.

1378
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:49,542
Leave it with me, boss.

1379
01:34:07,918 --> 01:34:10,918
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

1380
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,918
-Nervous?
-No.

1381
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,584
Remember your lines?
You only got two.

1382
01:34:21,459 --> 01:34:24,709
-Did you got the bit about the lights?
-Yes.

1383
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:29,667
One more thing, Danny.
Lose the shades.

1384
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,584
And we are back.

1385
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:43,167
With four guards by the pagoda.
I am blocking their comms.

1386
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,250
Blocked.

1387
01:34:45,334 --> 01:34:48,709
I have the two on the right.

1388
01:34:58,751 --> 01:35:00,959
Hello, boys. Hello.

1389
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:05,626
A lot of very serious faces down here.

1390
01:35:05,709 --> 01:35:08,258
You remember those two, don't you?
Trent and Arnold.

1391
01:35:08,342 --> 01:35:09,750
And one of you...

1392
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:12,250
You are Mike, is that right?

1393
01:35:12,334 --> 01:35:14,269
Well played, Mike.

1394
01:35:14,353 --> 01:35:18,166
A bit naughty for a government contractor,
but we are where we are.

1395
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,417
Moving on.

1396
01:35:21,751 --> 01:35:25,167
Two more ahead.
I'll take one o'clock.

1397
01:35:29,959 --> 01:35:33,417
The purpose of this visit is...
Danny?

1398
01:35:37,334 --> 01:35:40,292
You never paid Mr. Simmonds' commission.

1399
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:44,334
We were paying for you
to deliver but you didn't.

1400
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:48,375
-Mike did. You failed.
-That's a bit weak, isn't it, Trent?

1401
01:35:48,459 --> 01:35:50,030
Because I wasn't paid to deliver

1402
01:35:50,114 --> 01:35:53,250
I was paid to supply and I think
I have supplied, have I, Danny?

1403
01:35:53,334 --> 01:35:57,375
<i>-Orson, take a left through the hedges.</i>
-Two on the j.*

1404
01:35:59,918 --> 01:36:01,584
Now you're clear.

1405
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,453
Do we really have to listen to this?

1406
01:36:09,537 --> 01:36:12,250
You will listen to this,
and here's the reason.

1407
01:36:12,334 --> 01:36:16,125
I don't wanna patronize you.
I'm not a patronizing person.

1408
01:36:16,209 --> 01:36:21,417
But you three, one, two, three,
you are quite new to this game, aren't you?

1409
01:36:21,501 --> 01:36:25,292
And there' is a reason
why no one, and I do mean no one

1410
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:29,542
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Gaddafi, not Mr. Escobar...

1411
01:36:29,626 --> 01:36:33,042
and that's before I start dropping names,

1412
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,792
why none of them
have ever refused to pay me.

1413
01:36:35,876 --> 01:36:37,876
<i>Have you got me?</i>
-Going dark.

1414
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:41,918
-Repositioning, let me find you.
-In the Can-Am.

1415
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,750
Behind me on a horizon I think
you'll see an old derelict 1960s hotel.

1416
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,044
Need demolition.

1417
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:52,467
Now you could do that with, I don't know,
what, 30-40 pounds of Semtex,

1418
01:36:52,551 --> 01:36:54,945
is that about right, Mike?

1419
01:36:56,292 --> 01:37:01,167
Silence and darkness retained.
And you've got two more guards up top.

1420
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:05,209
Or you could do it with,
lights please, Danny.

1421
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:09,334
One AGM-65 Maverick missile.

1422
01:37:09,417 --> 01:37:13,751
Very much like this one,
in three, two, one...

1423
01:37:17,459 --> 01:37:19,959
What happened there then?

1424
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:25,375
Let's do that again.
In three, two, one...

1425
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:32,542
Wait, wait... There's more.

1426
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:48,417
Here we are. I think we're done now.

1427
01:37:49,918 --> 01:37:52,751
Danny, the lights again, please.

1428
01:37:54,542 --> 01:37:59,250
What are you trying to convey
with this illustration, Mr. Simmonds?

1429
01:37:59,334 --> 01:38:04,125
What I'm trying to convey, Mike,
is how little you boys understand

1430
01:38:04,209 --> 01:38:07,918
of the new world
which you find yourselves in.

1431
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,176
I would've thought it was obvious
that I'd have some kind  of insurance.

1432
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,109
And I do. Danny, give them the papers.

1433
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,667
You'll see in the left hand column

1434
01:38:19,751 --> 01:38:22,394
there's a list of names
and addresses of people

1435
01:38:22,478 --> 01:38:24,625
that I believe you hold near and dear.

1436
01:38:24,709 --> 01:38:27,000
<i>Take the service elevator, one level down.</i>

1437
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:29,459
And he's in. Phase two. Let's move.

1438
01:38:29,542 --> 01:38:32,852
In the right hand column
there's a very exact time

1439
01:38:32,936 --> 01:38:35,667
for when those people will be...

1440
01:38:35,751 --> 01:38:39,792
-What's the nice word for it, Danny?
-Uh... eviscerated.

1441
01:38:39,876 --> 01:38:42,267
That's not very nice word, is it?

1442
01:38:42,351 --> 01:38:44,208
But it's not gonna happen

1443
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:48,459
because I'm very confident
that within five minutes...

1444
01:38:48,542 --> 01:38:52,334
And five minutes is all you have
as the countdown has started.

1445
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:55,209
And the only thing that will stop it...

1446
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:03,125
is a phone call
from my business manager...

1447
01:39:05,042 --> 01:39:11,083
telling me that my money
has been transferred to my account.

1448
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,209
<i>So from this point it's out of my hands
and into yours.</i>

1449
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,667
Danny, let's go and have a drink. Come on.

1450
01:39:30,292 --> 01:39:32,334
Bye, boys.

1451
01:39:34,697 --> 01:39:40,918
-I'm giving him the money.
-Mike, that's my mom, there! Jean!

1452
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:45,897
That's the most impressive thing
I've seen a man do.

1453
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:48,208
Really? Really?

1454
01:39:48,292 --> 01:39:50,010
Get the transfer done now!

1455
01:39:50,094 --> 01:39:52,484
-We were set up to make a payment anyway.
-So get it done now!

1456
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:01,186
He's bluffing.

1457
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:03,667
Those explosions
didn't look like a bluff to me.

1458
01:40:03,751 --> 01:40:07,083
Turns out there's a reason they call him
the dark angel of merciless death, Mike.

1459
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:22,918
<i>Listen to me. He's bluffing.</i>

1460
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,709
Easy for you to say.
Do you even have anyone on your list?

1461
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:28,918
You can forget your commission, Mike.
It's going to Simmonds.

1462
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,375
You're a useless pair of silicon tits.
Let me handle this.

1463
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:34,047
Back off!

1464
01:40:34,131 --> 01:40:36,125
You handling it put us in this mess.

1465
01:40:36,209 --> 01:40:38,983
I'm not interested
in what you have to say, Mike!

1466
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:41,290
Now back the fuck off!

1467
01:40:50,501 --> 01:40:52,584
Backing off.

1468
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:55,125
Backing off.

1469
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:59,083
Everybody, calm down. Calm down.

1470
01:40:59,167 --> 01:41:00,804
Mike looks upset.

1471
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:04,458
-Orson, how are you doing?
-Still alive, still moving upwards.

1472
01:41:04,542 --> 01:41:07,834
Greg left with a movie star, seems like
things are getting a bit heated in there.

1473
01:41:07,918 --> 01:41:12,334
-Chris, progress report.
-It's happening. 30 seconds.

1474
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:15,121
They are doing the transferring now.

1475
01:41:15,205 --> 01:41:16,996
That's a billion dollars
to your Orphans of war.

1476
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:19,207
-We'll be okay.
-We won't be okay.

1477
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:21,625
Did you see what happened out there?
You think that's okay?

1478
01:41:21,709 --> 01:41:26,212
I am in their system.
I have all their content details.

1479
01:41:26,296 --> 01:41:27,975
I can move all their money.

1480
01:41:28,076 --> 01:41:32,785
Truth is I am better than them
and you don't need them anymore.

1481
01:41:32,876 --> 01:41:35,594
It was your fucking idea to get involved
with a fucking weapons dealer.

1482
01:41:35,678 --> 01:41:37,875
We have a problem
and we have to deal with it.

1483
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:42,334
There were explosions going off
on the fucking horizon--

1484
01:41:58,542 --> 01:42:03,709
-Is it safe to go in?
-Hard to tell, but there is nobody moving.

1485
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:22,542
Bit of a mess in here, whizz-kid.

1486
01:42:28,167 --> 01:42:30,375
I found the case, JJ.

1487
01:42:33,918 --> 01:42:36,542
Just checking.

1488
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,876
Looks good, boss.

1489
01:42:40,959 --> 01:42:44,667
<i>Orson, behind you.
In three, two, one...</i>

1490
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:56,501
Don't do it, Mike.

1491
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:59,542
Leave it where it lies.

1492
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:08,958
Orson, I need the case.
I need the fucking case!

1493
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:13,292
If you want it so bad, Mike,
you can fucking have it.

1494
01:43:36,292 --> 01:43:39,751
-What's you got in the case?
-Our wages.

1495
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:41,993
Is that Nathan with his army
to get us out of here?

1496
01:43:42,077 --> 01:43:44,041
That's not Nathan you can hear.

1497
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:48,459
That's Knighton's black ops incoming,
a little bit late as usual.

1498
01:43:48,542 --> 01:43:49,716
Nathan abandoned us.

1499
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,788
Apparently he has something
more important to do.

1500
01:43:51,872 --> 01:43:52,916
Of course he did.

1501
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,642
He sent the BPJ.

1502
01:43:54,726 --> 01:43:57,675
He's in Doha.
Apparently there's been another incident.

1503
01:43:57,759 --> 01:43:59,869
But he told me to tell you not to panic,

1504
01:43:59,953 --> 01:44:02,417
he has all of your medicinal
requirements on board.

1505
01:44:02,501 --> 01:44:06,667
-Did you bring a corkscrew?
-I'll be your corkscrew, baby.

1506
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:10,269
Of course you will.
Jump, we're going on a holiday.*

1507
01:44:43,584 --> 01:44:46,876
I suppose you all feeling
quite pleased with yourselves?

1508
01:44:46,959 --> 01:44:50,709
It's impossible to feel pleased
with ourselves on the wages that you pay.

1509
01:44:50,792 --> 01:44:52,371
I have some good news.

1510
01:44:52,455 --> 01:44:55,343
Since your last escapade
was such a success...

1511
01:44:55,427 --> 01:44:56,834
Don't let it go to your heads.

1512
01:44:56,918 --> 01:45:01,792
I have another job for you.
And this time the money is spectacular.

1513
01:45:01,876 --> 01:45:05,777
I don't care how spectacular it is,
I'm going on a holiday.

1514
01:45:05,897 --> 01:45:08,250
-That's yours.
-Where are we going, darling?

1515
01:45:08,334 --> 01:45:10,499
Don't know, and I don't care.

1516
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:13,458
As long as it's hot,
expensive and he's paying.

1517
01:45:13,542 --> 01:45:17,667
-We're taking the jet.
-Take it. Go wherever you want. Go mad.

1518
01:45:17,751 --> 01:45:20,140
Enjoy the snow, enjoy the beaches.
It's all on me.

1519
01:45:20,224 --> 01:45:22,333
As long as you're back in 36 hours.

1520
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:25,417
-Two weeks.
-Orson!

1521
01:45:25,501 --> 01:45:28,044
I'm not great at skiing.
I like the beach.

1522
01:45:28,151 --> 01:45:30,083
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm drunk.

1523
01:45:30,167 --> 01:45:32,501
-Fine, 48 hours!
-Ten days.

1524
01:45:32,584 --> 01:45:35,584
-You're killing me! 96 hours!
-A week.

1525
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:40,083
And Orson, we need the necklaces and
watches you stole from the Ukrainians.

1526
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:42,626
Their government wants them back.

1527
01:45:42,709 --> 01:45:45,865
Too late. I've sold them.
I've invested the money.

1528
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:47,932
We are now in a movie business.

1529
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:51,751
See you next Tuesday.

1530
01:45:51,834 --> 01:45:55,334
Hold on... Orson!

1531
01:45:55,417 --> 01:45:57,542
Wait, what movie business?

1532
01:45:57,626 --> 01:46:02,667
It better not involve Danny Francesco
and his fiance Greg Simmonds.

1533
01:46:30,209 --> 01:46:35,918
You were paying to deliver,
but you didn't. Mike did. You failed.

1534
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,389
Yeah, it's a bit naughty, Mr. Yamamoto.

1535
01:46:38,473 --> 01:46:41,193
I'm not paid to deliver,
I'm paid to supply.

1536
01:46:43,292 --> 01:46:47,584
Now, there's a very good reason
why no one, and I mean no one.

1537
01:46:47,667 --> 01:46:51,042
Not Mr. Hussein, not Mr. Gadaffi,
not Mr. Escobar...

1538
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,292
And that's before I start dropping names.

1539
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:58,158
Behind me on a horizon
there's a derelict monastery,

1540
01:46:58,242 --> 01:47:00,667
in need of demolition.

1541
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:02,417
How are we going to do that?

1542
01:47:02,501 --> 01:47:08,709
We could use 50-60 pounds of Semtex,
does that sound about right, Mr. Yamamoto?

1543
01:47:08,792 --> 01:47:15,209
Or we could use one
single AMG-65 Maverick missile.

1544
01:47:15,292 --> 01:47:17,672
Very much like this.

1545
01:47:17,756 --> 01:47:20,959
Going in three, two, one...

1546
01:47:24,075 --> 01:47:28,326
Fucking amateur.
Maxie, where is the VFX, Maxie?

1547
01:47:28,417 --> 01:47:30,959
-Come on, man, I can't work like this.
-Sorry, I'll get it fixed.

1548
01:47:31,042 --> 01:47:34,709
-Barney, can you get me Guy?
-Cut the camera. Reset everybody.

1549
01:47:37,459 --> 01:47:39,751
What do you think of that one, Greggy?

1550
01:47:39,834 --> 01:47:45,000
I'll be honest with you.
For me it was very very moving.

1551
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:47,250
That was beautiful, Danny.

1552
01:47:47,334 --> 01:47:50,834
-That one?
-That one.

1553
01:47:50,918 --> 01:47:53,456
I don't know, that was not my best take.

1554
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,583
Did you like that one?

1555
01:47:55,667 --> 01:47:59,542
I love that take because you're smiley
but you're scary too.

1556
01:47:59,626 --> 01:48:04,876
Yeah, but look at my hair, it's off.
It just feels like it's off.

1557
01:48:04,959 --> 01:48:08,667
-There. And there. Brilliant.
-I think we can do another one.

1558
01:48:08,751 --> 01:48:10,797
-Go on then. Off you go.
-Guys!

1559
01:48:10,881 --> 01:48:15,083
