2
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,109
Nathan!

3
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:45,067
- How are you, old man?
- Very good, thank you, Mr. Knighton.

4
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,892
You look like the walking dead.

5
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,150
Yes, I'm always a little bit cold
when I've just got out of the bed.

6
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:53,776
Perhaps you can tell me why I've been
summoned 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning?

7
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,734
If you'd care to study the film

8
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:58,610
you'll see that two nights ago
some heavily guarded cargo

9
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:01,066
was ambushed outside of facility in Odessa

10
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,551
where 20 security guards
were mercilessly annihilated.

11
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:07,317
I want you to retrieve what went missing.

12
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:11,101
And to find out who the seller is,
who the buyer is...

13
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,704
and what it is.

14
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:17,234
So we don't know exactly what it is, sir?

15
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:20,317
No, that is the mystery.

16
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,131
But our analysts and intelligence
reported that very quickly

17
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:25,941
it became extremely popular
with the wrong sort of people.

18
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,476
And with a price tag of around 10 billion

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,616
I don't think we can afford
for it to remain a mystery much longer.

20
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:37,317
It's been given a name "The Handle."

21
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:40,359
But why me,
why not the official intelligence branch?

22
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:45,734
<i>Ruse de Guerre,</i> Nathan.
An unorthodox approach to war.

23
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,735
I need a creative, cunning
and unconventional vision

24
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,351
to retrieve this kind of mercurial threat.

25
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,942
A Currier on a bicycle
in congested traffic.

26
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,392
Not the official team.

27
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,739
They take forever
to wave through the administration

28
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,782
and the clock does ticketh.

29
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:06,609
- So, who would be heading up your team?
- The usual chap: Orson Fortune.

30
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:11,067
Oh, fuck!
That man is an administrative nightmare.

31
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,414
He can't fly unless there's a private jet
because of claustrophobia,

32
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,400
then he needs sedating with the finest
claret because of agoraphobia,

33
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,914
and then there's a rehabilitation
in the Maldives

34
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:22,642
because of a clouda bloody -phobia.

35
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,267
Yes, I understand, sir,
but when you cut back on his expenses

36
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:29,733
and created a mental health department
it was a perfect storm.

37
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,692
He's trained to exploit
every system presented,

38
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:36,615
which is why he is a very
bicycle Currier you require.

39
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,618
Where is he?

40
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:42,275
That's funny you should say that, sir,
he's on one of his rehabilitation retreats.

41
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:48,192
Yes, you are paying for that, sir,
but don't worry, I think I can pull him in.

42
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,150
- The fuck are you doing here, Nathan?
- Everything alright, Orson?

43
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:54,042
No, it's not.
I'm supposed to be on a holiday.

44
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:57,233
And you're supposed to be
four thousand miles in that direction.

45
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:01,734
Actually it's three thousand miles
in that direction, but whatever.

46
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:05,609
- Mind if I come in?
- Yes, I fucking do.

47
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:08,053
- Aren't you gonna ask why I'm here?
- No, I'm fucking not.

48
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:09,217
Because you're not staying.

49
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,484
Wouldn't be here if it wasn't serious.

50
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,145
I don't care how fucking serious it is.

51
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:16,108
I'm on holiday and I'm not interested
in working at the moment.

52
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:20,503
There's a price to pay
to possessing a unique set of skills

53
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:22,775
being as brilliant as you are,

54
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:25,859
and please don't take this the wrong way,

55
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:30,509
as a private contractor your government
pays you handsomely for.

56
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,609
I'm ignoring this apparition.
I'm talking to an empty space.

57
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,443
Look at her.
I'm gonna meet my girlfriend...

58
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:38,776
at the bar.

59
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,838
Ah, yes, about that girlfriend of yours.

60
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:45,275
It seems as though
she's not just your girlfriend.

61
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,766
But don't worry,
I will fly her home first class.

62
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,293
Have you been spying on me, Nathan?

63
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:54,067
I am sorry, but something
rather nasty has been stolen.

64
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,484
How nasty?

65
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,646
Under File A there's File B.

66
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,066
That's the list of nefarious potential
buyers whose interest has been aroused.

67
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,776
We don't know what was stolen.
That remains a mystery for you to solve.

68
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:10,442
But we need to stop it
getting onto the open market.

69
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,109
- Threat's imminent.
- How imminent?

70
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,391
Imminently imminent.

71
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,858
Put it this way, when you hit the ground
you'll be running, literally.

72
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,192
I've got the plane, the BPJ,
this year's model.

73
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:25,983
And all your medicinal requirements:
82, 96, 2004...

74
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:30,900
Marinade, and I'll see you in two minutes.

75
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:34,442
<i>Fine, so Orson will be heading your team.</i>

76
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:37,609
<i>- Will you be using John, the comms man?
- Sadly not, sir.</i>

77
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:40,332
- Isn't he the best?
- He might be good.

78
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,191
But he turned out to be
something of duplicitous snake.

79
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:48,816
- He went over to Mike Hook's team.
- Ah, Mike, the competition.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,232
Yes, I do hope we won't be competing
for the same prize

81
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:53,525
on this mission with Mike?

82
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:56,601
There is more than one
Security Department in this government.

83
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,275
Mike is on another job.

84
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,859
Very good, sir.

85
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,150
- Afternoon, Lucinda.
- Sir.

86
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:06,895
- I was starting to worry.
- I had to get changed.

87
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:07,989
Didn't we all?

88
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,401
- Captain, can we warm the engines up?
- Right away, sir.

89
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,776
- Isn't that the 82?
- It's still drinking well.

90
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:17,275
- Except this is my medicinal requirement.
- Yes.

91
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:21,900
Thirsty, were you?
Party for one. Like all your parties.

92
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:29,307
- Is it the usual team?
- Minus John.

93
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,899
- Where's John?
- John's got poached.

94
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,359
- By who?
- By <i>whom</i>. Never mind.

95
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:37,609
But I do mind. I know John, I like John,
I trust John, he's a pro.

96
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,192
- Someone paying him more?
- Yes.

97
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,258
- If I asked, would you pay me more?
- You can ask.

98
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,191
- Would you pay me more?
- No.

99
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,859
You're above that grumpy self interest.
You're a patriot.

100
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,025
And besides, no one gets treated
like you get treated.

101
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:54,983
When you say "you" you really mean <i>you.</i>

102
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,109
- Anyway, who's my footman?
- I found a splendid replacement.

103
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:01,067
- What's his name?
- Sarah Fidel.

104
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,526
Strong <i>nom de guerre.</i>
Never heard of him.

105
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:08,816
- It's because she's an American.
- She...

106
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,567
Lucinda, bring the 2004 Haut-Brion please.

107
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,776
Ah...

108
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:20,526
I'll help myself to a beer.

109
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,298
<i>I have a rather fabulous replacement
for comms John.</i>

110
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:27,650
An American,
much more versatile and creative.

111
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:31,526
- Sarah Fidel.
- Didn't she work with Mike?

112
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:35,058
Mike, consistent with his character
abandoned her in Beirut,

113
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:36,400
which is where I picked her up.

114
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:39,442
- Any other footman?
- Yes, this young man.

115
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,818
JJ Davies. There really isn't
very much he can't do either.

116
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,609
Comms, guns, driving, diving,
wrapping, slapping, you name it.

117
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:51,192
They are both two comprehensive footman,
the perfect all-rounds.

118
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:04,859
- Isn't that JJ? What's he doing there?
- He's joined the team.

119
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,173
He's a good kid,
but he's a little bit green.

120
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:10,692
He's been very busy
since you last saw him.

121
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:15,109
He's what you might call
enthusiastic, hungry, keen.

122
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,150
Don't get your fingers near his mouth.

123
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,859
- JJ.
- Sir.

124
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,484
Mr. Fortune, meet Miss Fidel.

125
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:27,025
- Miss Fidel.
- Your Highness.

126
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:31,959
Probably you're the new John.

127
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,734
Not meaning a toilet
or a prostitute's client I take it.

128
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:38,526
Please don't pee on me,
I don't do that anymore.

129
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:45,983
John didn't have a personality.
I liked John.

130
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,192
You can call her John
if it makes you more comfortable.

131
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:52,067
- He was reliable.
- Wasn't that reliable.

132
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,484
- Heard he got poached by my old team.
- Your old team?

133
00:08:56,567 --> 00:09:00,983
The other leading private contractor,
favored by your government.

134
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:04,869
You worked for Mike?
Mike - the competition Mike?

135
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,650
You may not like Mike, but Mike is good.

136
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,150
What do we got?

137
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,785
A bagman, coming in on a flight
with a hard drive.

138
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,692
We need to track him.
See where he takes it.

139
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:17,633
I'm gonna keep an eye on you.
Feed you constructive information.

140
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:18,608
Play the right music.

141
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,758
I control the turntables,
you control the dance floor.

142
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,275
You like to dance?

143
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,786
I like John.

144
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,646
We'll send him some flowers
on your behalf.

145
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,600
Got anything yet?

146
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:45,608
Okay, I'm getting somewhere very slowly,
still dialing in.

147
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,609
Can you hear it?

148
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:52,192
Do you actually know
how to use a computer?

149
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:56,501
I'm sure I can find my way
if you just tell me where the on button is.

150
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:59,442
Nathan, we've been here for three hours
and my feet hurt.

151
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,899
<i>She's your responsibility,
she slips I piss on you.</i>

152
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:04,484
I hired her. I trust her.

153
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:08,234
We have a three hour window.
He's gotta be with us soon.

154
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,858
- In fact, on cue, I think I got him.
- About time.

155
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:16,279
<i>Hiding in that crocodile
should be the drive,</i>

156
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,400
<i>what's on the drive we don't know.</i>

157
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,936
<i>Orson, just remember he's a bagman,
a retired professor,</i>

158
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:24,189
<i>not a threat,
or a black belt in Mogadishu.</i>

159
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,283
<i>I'll try not to frighten him to death.</i>

160
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,650
<i>We just need to know
who he's delivering it to.</i>

161
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,369
<i>Whizz-kid, what am I looking for?</i>

162
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:33,692
Brown hat, spectacles,
crocodile-skin briefcase, upper level.

163
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:36,900
<i>He should be coming into your peepers now.</i>

164
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:40,153
<i>I'm in his phone, and I'm gonna send
him a message: "Car is delayed."</i>

165
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:41,775
<i>- You see him, sweetheart?</i>
- Got him.

166
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:44,442
<i>Sending him to Luigi's coffee bar,
ground floor.</i>

167
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:47,567
- How do you know it's him?
- You dance, I play, remember?

168
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:50,651
- Jane, he's heading your way.
- In position.

169
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,776
JJ, take the B stairs.

170
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,965
He's passing me now.
Heading to coffee shop.

171
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,872
<i>He's all yours.</i>

172
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,692
I still see you in position.
Jane, respond.

173
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,442
Jane?

174
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:15,317
- Wakey, wakey, whizz-kid.
- Orson, I'm getting no response from Jane.

175
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:18,359
JJ, keep your peepers peeled
and your hands out of your pockets.

176
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:21,025
Peepers peeled, hands flying free.

177
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,442
Marcia, the job is yours,
catch him at the counter.

178
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:28,234
<i>- Confirm when the tracker's in place.</i>
- Moving in now.

179
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:33,067
- Why do I smell something rhey?
- I smell it too.

180
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,359
Marcia, confirm tracker in place.

181
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:43,526
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!
Confirm tracker in place.

182
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,240
Why do I get the feeling
we're not the only team in town?

183
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,400
<i>Can't be. I would know.</i>

184
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:53,900
That's odd, either it's a glitch
in the network or someone is very good.

185
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,275
In my experience it's seldom the network.
Who could do that?

186
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:02,651
John. John could do that.

187
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,900
Smells like Team B.
Nathan, what the fuck are they doing here?

188
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:10,859
If that weasel John is here
it means that turd Mike is too. Stand by.

189
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:16,067
- Nathan.
<i>- Mike isn't on a different job, is he, sir?</i>

190
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,150
Or is it a coincidence that his team
is in Madrid airport?

191
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:22,692
If he's there
it isn't because of my department.

192
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,957
My world works
in a similar fashion to yours.

193
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,373
The government
likes to keep departments competed.

194
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,483
Competition for the best condition.

195
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,388
Mike only has two talents:
Blowing his cover and blowing himself.

196
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,472
But thanks for the heads up.

197
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:39,210
Orson, confirmed.
Mike is here to track the crocodile.

198
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:40,564
Mike's clumsy and predictable,

199
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:42,918
they're not here to track him,
they're here to pick him up.

200
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,317
I resolved the glitch,
we're going back live.

201
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:49,692
JJ, change of policy.
Not go in, go out. Exit 2F pincer.

202
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,651
On it, boss.

203
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,804
You have two inbound.
Eight and six o'clock.

204
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:58,011
Understood.

205
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:03,816
Just tell me
they haven't tasered the girls.

206
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,651
<i>- Oh, yes, tasered.</i>
- Let me feel your rhythm, whizz-kid.

207
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:12,526
- Count me in.
<i>- Three, two, one.</i>

208
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:26,484
Take a deep breath, that's right.

209
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:35,650
<i>Our man is en route to exit.
Main gate departures. Two bees in pursuit.</i>

210
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,859
<i>I'm on it. I'm exiting
through the parallel doors.</i>

211
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,442
Gracias.

212
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:44,031
<i>He's moving to taxi. 49502.</i>

213
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,941
- Nathan, you're needed.
- Incoming.

214
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,942
<i>- JJ, your location?
- Exiting through east parallel doors.</i>

215
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:52,062
<i>- Senor? Senor? Hola Senor.
- Mr. Bakker...</i>

216
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:53,692
No, no, I cannot come with you.

217
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,942
<i>Two more bees buzzing in the car.</i>

218
00:13:56,025 --> 00:14:00,692
- Mr. Bakker.
<i>- Lo siento señor. Lo siento senor.</i>

219
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,483
Heart. Heart.

220
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,609
JJ, wheel.

221
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:17,651
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't know.

222
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:20,146
- He keeps saying he's hot.
- No, no, heart.

223
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,427
Loosen his tie.

224
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:24,860
He doesn't feel very hot.

225
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:27,394
He's not hot, you idiots,
he has a heart condition.

226
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:32,025
There's two of them in pursuit.

227
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:35,162
<i>The drive will be encrypted
but I can clone it remotely.</i>

228
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:36,545
Connect me to the hard drive.

229
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,854
The road is blocked.

230
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,257
They have my wife. They will kill her.

231
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:50,317
JJ, lock the doors.

232
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,734
There's dozen of them. Fully armed.

233
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:58,359
Get out! Get out of the vehicle, now!

234
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:01,275
I need more time.
I need another 20 seconds.

235
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,275
They don't me. My face.

236
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:10,192
You go to The Duchess.
Table 12, 6:00 p.m. Save my wife!

237
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,025
Four...

238
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:24,359
<i>Three... two...</i>

239
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,900
Open the door!

240
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:29,526
<i>I've got it. Let it go.</i>

241
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:44,067
We gonna need a shovel.

242
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,734
- Nathan.
- Mike. Nice of you to knock.

243
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:50,942
- Orson.
- Mike.

244
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:56,275
That belongs to me.

245
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:05,776
- What'd you do to our friend here?
- You scared him to death, Mike.

246
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,983
It's good, sir.

247
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,359
It's like a mouse always gets the cheese.

248
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,818
Let's go.

249
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,192
<i>The drive is good but it's scrambled,
without the data key it's useless.</i>

250
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:27,359
<i>So our best option deliver the drive
and find out who the buyer is.</i>

251
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:41,118
<i>No one interesting has joined the rooftop
in the last 40 minutes, so...</i>

252
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:44,818
whoever you're there to meet
is already there.

253
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:47,429
Here we go.

254
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:50,150
Nathan, your file says you're terrible
at accents, so don't talk.

255
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:53,317
Bakker?

256
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,567
Is this for me?

257
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,317
Have a good evening.

258
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:12,317
I think I got him.
He's coming back as Ben Harris.

259
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:17,942
Ben Harris. He's the lawyer/consigliere
to Greg Simmonds.

260
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:20,980
- Who's Greg Simmonds?
- It's a billionaire arms dealer.

261
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:22,442
Only plays in the top tier.

262
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:26,567
Interested in selling 9mm to kids,
he's selling tomahawks to terrorists.

263
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,192
He's impossible to catch. Pretty elusive.

264
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,193
He only uses Ben Harris
on his biggest deals,

265
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:33,586
like if he's turned up in person.

266
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,692
Speaks for itself.

267
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,387
Oh, hello. This might be useful.

268
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,111
Greg's hosting a charity event in Cannes.

269
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,900
That's convenient,
cause we're also going to Cannes.

270
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:46,402
- Seems he loves an orphan.
- He wants two. He made enough of them.

271
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,234
We've picked up some time, so we'll be
arriving into LA in less than four hours.

272
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,234
LA?

273
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:07,067
When I put my head down,
we were heading to the South of France.

274
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,275
So, can someone please tell me
why are we flying to Los Angeles?

275
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,401
- The power of no, Nathan.
- I'm sorry?

276
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,368
Backwards to go forwards.

277
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:18,525
We're going to LA
to pick up our invitation.

278
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,275
- That being?
- Danny Francesco.

279
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,859
Danny Francesco? The movie star?

280
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:35,109
Goddamnit!
I do the stunts, you shoot the money.

281
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:38,674
Wake up, everybody!

282
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:40,150
Chad, get out of the fucking car!

283
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:44,454
Greg Simmonds'
favorite movie star - Danny Francesco.

284
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,121
And how does that get us in?

285
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:48,983
You can't catch this fish
with conventional lures.

286
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,150
Greg wants what everyone wants -
what they can't have.

287
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:55,526
There's nothing he can't buy
apart from Danny Francesco,

288
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,159
who recently snubbed
a 10 million dollar offer

289
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:00,522
to jump out of a cake
and sing him Happy Birthday.

290
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:04,644
He's obsessed with celebrities,
but more obsessed with their partners.

291
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,859
Sarah will be going as Danny's girlfriend.

292
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:10,040
It's the fish
that can't be caught, Nathan.

293
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:11,131
The power of no.

294
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,359
And how do we turn
this movie star's "no" into a "yes"?

295
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:19,526
- I think we've got something.
- Blackmail?

296
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:23,651
- Yeah, blackmail.
<i>- Ruse de guerre...</i>

297
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:25,692
Very good. Carry on.

298
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,994
So how are you gonna play this?

299
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,194
I found some spectacular dirt

300
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,858
on the infamous
movie producer Saul Goldstein,

301
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,537
so I've told him into help us.

302
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:36,108
I asked Saul to lure Danny to Vegas
under the premise of the five picture deal.

303
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,569
But as Greg is hosting
his Charity Fund Raising event

304
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:39,799
that we would like to attend

305
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,483
you're going to ask Danny Francesco
to come with us instead.

306
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:47,109
Creative work.
So what we got on Danny Francesco?

307
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,942
He's having an affair
with his sister-in-law.

308
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,109
I told you she was good.

309
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,859
Leave this with me.

310
00:19:55,942 --> 00:20:00,109
Fucking Swedish accent, fucking Swedish...

311
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:06,150
What are you doing, Saul?
Saul, you're a fabulous producer…

312
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,594
I mean you're a piece of shit,
but you're fabulous producer.

313
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,827
Everybody wants to work with you.
I wanna work with you.

314
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:15,442
But a Swedish accent, Saul?
Come on, I'm an American.

315
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:19,358
Hello, Natasha.
Andy's not gonna need you on this flight.

316
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:22,401
- Really?
- Yeah, on of those things.

317
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:27,025
I appreciate that, Danny.
But we need you to do this for us.

318
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,317
For us? What, the royal "us"?
What are you talking about?

319
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:37,900
- I mean you have to do this for us.
- I have to?

320
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,350
I don't mean to contradict you, Saul,

321
00:20:42,478 --> 00:20:44,734
but I don't have to do anything
for anybody.

322
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:48,734
And I don't wanna contradict you, Danny,
but we all have to do our bit.

323
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:53,442
I'm sorry, I though you were here
to serve the coffee.

324
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:56,983
Why do I suddenly feel
like I'm being ganged up on here, Saul?

325
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:01,776
- Who are you?
- I'm your new manager.

326
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,983
I'm sorry, kid,
they had something on me too.

327
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,859
Okay, Saul, where are you going?

328
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm gonna let you converse
with your new manager.

329
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,317
You're gonna do great, Danny.
You're a star.

330
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:17,659
Saul, hey, Saul,
where do you think you... this is---

331
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,983
- See you soon.
- Saul...

332
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:21,692
Don't you dare to leave-- Natasha!

333
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,526
Where is Natasha?

334
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:28,484
Who let this man on my plane?

335
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,692
Natasha!

336
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:32,083
This is my plane!

337
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,025
Yes, it is, Danny,
and it's a lovely plane.

338
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:37,442
But you're gonna have to trust me
for two minutes.

339
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:38,613
Why should I?

340
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,233
Because you're an actor.
You're a movie star.

341
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,212
Because you're a professional.

342
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,067
Imagine we're on the scene.
Please, sit down.

343
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,336
Are you a patriot?

344
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,358
I don't vote Republican
if that's what you mean.

345
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:04,407
Okay, let me give it to you
in a different way.

346
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:08,776
The world needs you
for you greatest role yet.

347
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:12,526
You and I are going to a party.

348
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:16,567
- Who are you?
- I'm your manager, Charlie Rosewood.

349
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:20,818
You're no longer going to Vegas.
We're going to Cannes.

350
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,773
No, you are getting off of my plane
and Natasha's gonna make you.

351
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:27,275
Natasha? Natasha?

352
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,025
- What the fuck have you done with Natasha?
- Please calm down.

353
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:36,067
There's a sensitive and awkward situation
between you and your sister-in-law.

354
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,942
That you probably
shouldn't have filmed.

355
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:55,900
- I actually love my sister-in-law.
- Yes, Danny, you made that quite evident.

356
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,437
Turns out everyone thinks
you're a superstar, Danny.

357
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,650
Once they heard you were in town
they came to us.

358
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,692
Stop.

359
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:13,264
I don't think I can do this.

360
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,040
- No, no... nope.
- Danny.

361
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:17,816
- Danny.
- Trust yourself.

362
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,387
No need to be nervous.

363
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:22,025
No reason to be nervous?
They are only killers.

364
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,049
We've all seen you handle killers before
on a screen.

365
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,650
Fundamentally there's no difference.

366
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:29,413
What do you think an agent does? They act.

367
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:32,358
And no one acts better that you, Danny.

368
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:37,150
The best agents are stars,
the best actors are movie stars.

369
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,669
I guess that's sorta true.

370
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,816
You're an actor. Act.

371
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,759
There's a big difference
between an actor and a movie star.

372
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:47,770
And that is why
they're obsessed with you.

373
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:48,854
Yeah.

374
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,776
That and the fact that I didn't jump out
of a cake for 10 million dollars.

375
00:23:56,317 --> 00:24:00,692
Okay, while I'm busy playing my part
what are you two gonna be doing?

376
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,595
We need to get close enough
to Greg Simmonds

377
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,328
to remotely access his cell.

378
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:12,900
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go to work.

379
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,816
<i>Walking on set.</i>

380
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,411
Good.

381
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,071
Remember, you are not there
to buy anything.

382
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:55,025
I'm sure I don't have to remind you

383
00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:59,484
that you spent the entire annual budget
on wine during the flight over.

384
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:03,392
<i>So lay off the wine,
concentrate on getting into Greg's phone,</i>

385
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,561
<i>and identify who's actually buying
this Handle.</i>

386
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:06,645
Understood.

387
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,242
Danny, we good?

388
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:10,775
Good? Is that a joke?

389
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,595
Remember, you're a professional.

390
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,959
- You're playing yourself.
- But I've never played myself--

391
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:18,473
- You can do this.
- Danny.

392
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:20,752
<i>Lot number four
from the Quintess Collection</i>

393
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:23,816
<i>is a pair of diamond
and sapphire earrings.</i>

394
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,236
<i>And a round of applause, please,
sir Jonathan Mendes</i>

395
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,442
<i>for winning the 258,000 dollars--</i>

396
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:33,651
...happy ending,
because he was diagnosed with, um...

397
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,158
What's that-- What's that funny cancer?
Um...

398
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:37,776
Is there a funny cancer?

399
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,540
I can't remember what it was,
but it was something like cock cancer.

400
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:42,502
And he...

401
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:47,567
- Would someone pinch me, please?
- Pinch you, why?

402
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,561
Because I think I'm dreaming.

403
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:50,942
Is that...

404
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,226
Is that Danny Francesco?
You know I'm a little bit excited...

405
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:59,234
- I do love Danny Francesco.
- Everyone loves Danny Francesco.

406
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:02,401
I'm a little bit starstruck.
I am. It's not cool, but I am.

407
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:04,942
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

408
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:08,812
- Hi.
- Danny, do you like this...

409
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,169
Do you like this piece?

410
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:13,150
Love it.

411
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:17,554
It's one thing utilizing the expense cap
because you have psychological issues,

412
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,858
it's another thing
bankrupting the department.

413
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:24,150
What's he doing here?
Is that you, Benjamin bunny?

414
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,859
Not guilty, Mr. Simmonds.

415
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:28,567
- It was you, wasn't it?
- It's a surprise, sir.

416
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:31,526
How much is that fabulous item?

417
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,734
Lot number 15, 1.5 million dollars.

418
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:38,317
Lot number 15
from the Habsburg collection.

419
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:42,317
- Do you like it, Danny?
- It's wonderful. 1.5 million you say?

420
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,109
Anything Danny buys he can pay
for himself, he can afford it.

421
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:49,776
- He likes it.
- Don't you fucking dare, Orson.

422
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,428
- I'll take it.
- Orson!

423
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:54,150
Sadly he can't, it's no longer available.

424
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:55,234
Shame.

425
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:57,941
It's not a terrible shame,
it now belongs to you.

426
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:01,401
Complements of Mr. Simmonds.
He's a big fan.

427
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:04,067
Mr. Danny Francesco...

428
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,810
Look at you. The one and only. The legend.

429
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:08,851
You're very kind.

430
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:12,066
I'm Greg Simmonds,
and I wanna thank you very much

431
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,780
for all the entertainment
you've provided us over the years.

432
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:15,775
Thank you.

433
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:20,109
Listen, it's a fantastic gesture,
but I can't accept it.

434
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,109
No, you can. And you can for two reasons.

435
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:28,859
One - you deserve it.
Two - it's a fund raiser.

436
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:33,567
Speaking of which,
would you care to meet Trent and Arnold,

437
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,942
who are both are in the biotech.
I don't wanna be vulgar, but...

438
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:39,502
Twenty two billion, 17 billion.

439
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:41,867
Sorry, boys, I didn't wanna
be indiscreet, but you know...

440
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:43,025
facts are facts.

441
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,350
And they are both sponsoring
tonight's event.

442
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,233
- Hey.
- Big fan.

443
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:49,192
Oh, thank you. Great cause.

444
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:51,498
We try, you know...

445
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:54,346
Orphans, war...

446
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:01,000
Let me introduce to you
the lovely Michaela.

447
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:05,067
- What an absolute pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine.

448
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,359
Can I just say,
are we allowed to say these things now?

449
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:11,401
Wow. Wow. Wow.

450
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:14,692
- Hello, what's your name?
- Charlie Rosewood.

451
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,150
- Hello, Charlie.
- My business manager, Charlie Rosewood.

452
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:21,150
Are you sure?

453
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:24,609
You don't look like a business manager.

454
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:29,025
- Books, covers...
- Oh, yeah, big book, aren't you?

455
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,091
He's doubled my money
in the last three years.

456
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,442
Is that right?
You got any tips for me then?

457
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:35,819
I don't think you need any tips,
do you, Mr. Simmonds?

458
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:37,941
You'd be surprised, I'm very very greedy.

459
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:42,150
But maybe tonight you'll be loosening
the purse strings a bit for us.

460
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:47,317
No tax benefits, so no chance.
And Danny doesn't like kids.

461
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:57,353
You know, actually we've got two
of the board orphans here tonight,

462
00:28:57,437 --> 00:28:59,268
and they're really annoying.

463
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,375
I don't want to be pushy,

464
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:03,542
but there's a lot of very interesting
people at this party, and I would...

465
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:08,317
Emilia, could you take that
for me, me darling?

466
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,484
I would love you to meet some of them.

467
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:15,235
Mr. Simmonds, I would love to,
I'm just-- I'm actually quite shy.

468
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,941
Danny, it's the least you can do.

469
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:21,025
Mr. Simmonds here just spent
1.5 million on you.

470
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:25,942
But no, to be accurate, I didn't spend it
on Danny, I spent it on Michaela.

471
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:31,983
Suggestion, why don't we all retire
to the cocktail master?

472
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,496
That's what you usually call me,
right honey?

473
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,783
Minus the tail.

474
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:43,734
I don't think I believe what I just heard.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

475
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:46,974
Come on, over to the bar.
You're gonna wash your mouth out there.

476
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:48,408
Come on, Danny.

477
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,616
So I grabbed him by the balls,
and I say:

478
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,260
"If you'll speak like that to her again

479
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,816
I'm gonna rip off your head
and shit down your neck."

480
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,651
But I feel something,
I feel a little lump,

481
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:13,942
Two days later
he's diagnosed with testicular cancer.

482
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:17,567
A year later he wins
his first Tour de France.

483
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,818
I love that. He's funny, isn't he?
And he's naughty too.

484
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,526
- Yes...
- Go on, Danny, give me some more.

485
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,275
<i>How are we gonna get to his cell?</i>

486
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,858
His guard still has it,
we've been watching her. Go find her.

487
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:34,192
- One for the footman then.
- Really, why can't you do it?

488
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,508
You wanted to be more than a whizz-kid?

489
00:30:36,595 --> 00:30:39,858
You wanna get in the field?
Get your shoes dirty.

490
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:42,495
Go on, everyone, have another cocktail,
keep him busy.

491
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,317
He cost a fortune,
didn't you, Jean-Pierre?

492
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:46,198
Look at that! Look at that! It's magic.

493
00:30:46,282 --> 00:30:48,567
That's it, do with the monkey business.
Flip, flip...

494
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:51,489
I'll get you yours, Michaela,
why don't you go to the powder room.

495
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:52,858
Thank you so much.

496
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,251
Not so much magic, it's just a little bit
of practice, I can do that.

497
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:56,779
While I'll powder my nose

498
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:58,775
what would you be doing,
Mr. Charlie Rosewood?

499
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:04,192
The waiter behind you
was also at the Madrid airport.

500
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,861
Nathan, Mike's back again.

501
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:08,108
I heard. You deal with Greg.
I'll handle Mike.

502
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:12,192
You do your thing and I'll do mine.

503
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:14,776
Okay, sweetheart.

504
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:16,479
Go on then, give us some more,

505
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:19,213
go back to the dirty ones,
cause I like them best.

506
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:26,150
<i>Lot number six from the Delamont collection
is a one of kind blue sapphire encrusted...</i>

507
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,651
- Where am I going?
<i>- She's near his office.</i>

508
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,358
Yes, thank you, I know, where is it?

509
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,275
Keep going, and then turn left at the end.

510
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,401
<i>You must stay in range for a couple
of minutes for me to get a lock.</i>

511
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:39,335
Evening, Nathan.

512
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,191
You got your boys in
to mess things up again?

513
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:45,442
Mike, nobody likes you. Even your wife.

514
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:47,551
Well, that's what she told me anyway

515
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:50,275
whilst trying to untangle herself
from my chest hair.

516
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,859
<i>One day you'll grow up, Nathan,
and you'll realize -</i>

517
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:56,851
I've got more money, more men, more Intel.

518
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:58,775
You don't stand a chance.

519
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,156
<i>In which department?</i>

520
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:02,976
<i>She did whisper you have
an alarmingly small penis.</i>

521
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,976
<i>And I know you have
an incredibly small brain.</i>

522
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,692
<i>Is it me that should be worried?</i>

523
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:10,033
<i>Still running operations
out of the back of your garage?</i>

524
00:32:10,147 --> 00:32:11,816
<i>At least I have an operation.</i>

525
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,980
<i>There's a difference between
you needing an operation</i>

526
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:15,400
<i>and me having the operation.</i>

527
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,365
<i>We're way ahead of you
on this, Nathan.</i>

528
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,941
<i>Outclassed as usual.</i>

529
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:21,864
<i>You'll only mess this up
like you do all the others, Mike.</i>

530
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:23,534
<i>Stay outta my way.</i>

531
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:29,692
Spew good little buggy.

532
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:33,484
- Okay, what do I do now?
<i>- Stay where you are.</i>

533
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,029
Emilia is in the room
the other side of that wall.

534
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:37,608
I can get a lock if you stand there.

535
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,942
<i>Keep backing up towards the door.</i>

536
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:43,025
If I get any closer
my ass is gonna go through it.

537
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,680
JJ, who is this guy?

538
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,567
<i>With you in a minute,
I'm dealing with Sarah.</i>

539
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,154
Hurry up, cause I'm on him.

540
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,181
<i>Okay, the phone's on now.</i>

541
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:01,942
Can I help you?

542
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:05,150
Hi. I was just looking at this painting.

543
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,734
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Michaela.

544
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:14,983
I'm here with Danny Francesco.

545
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:18,359
That's it. I saw you earlier.

546
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:22,401
Greg told me he had this amazing painting,
and he knows I'm an art lover, so...

547
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,540
I actually curate
Mr. Simmonds' collection.

548
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:27,624
- No way.
- Yeah.

549
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:31,442
- This is actually an original Rhed.
- Wow... Rhed with an H.

550
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:36,942
Wow, you really know your stuff,
that's pretty esoteric.

551
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:41,818
- Do you work in the art?
- No, I'm just an enthusiast.

552
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,317
I still need a few minutes.
Keep him talking.

553
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,771
I'm always curious
about the philosophical details

554
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:51,734
behind a collector's motivation.

555
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:56,776
- We diving somewhere deep here?
- I don't know, are we?

556
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:59,477
<i>Orson, you're not gonna like him.
He's a horror story.</i>

557
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:01,590
<i>He's Vincent Young, ex special forces.</i>

558
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:03,399
<i>He's good with his feet,
and worse with his hands.</i>

559
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:06,870
<i>Alright, JJ, I didn't need
his life story, I just wanted his name.</i>

560
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:08,108
<i>Now disconnect his comms.</i>

561
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:12,109
Good evening, sir.
Vincent, is it?

562
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:15,609
- Vincent, can I hear Orson?
<i>- Sorry, how can I help you, sir?</i>

563
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:18,942
Relax, Mike cannot hear
this conversation.

564
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,275
Here you go, Michael, enjoy this.

565
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,692
Vincent? Vincent!

566
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:30,067
- Comms disconnected.
- Who's Mike?

567
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,109
We can play that game if you wanna.

568
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:36,651
But one way or another
you gonna swim to the shore.

569
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:39,401
Vincent!

570
00:34:39,484 --> 00:34:40,942
Please, continue.

571
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:45,942
I am interested in the paradox
of the dualistic motivation.

572
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,359
He will try and bribe you. Don't listen.

573
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:53,025
The only question is,
are you gonna do it with the broken nose...

574
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:59,776
or with your face intact
and this watch on your wrist.

575
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:02,380
<i>The canvas should be a portal</i>

576
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:06,150
into the abstract
infinite life transcendent,

577
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:10,150
which of course gives creative expression
its inner value.

578
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:12,122
Mike? Checking, Mike.

579
00:35:13,692 --> 00:35:16,067
Fuck you, Orson!

580
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,983
Checking.

581
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,734
<i>Were is the paradox?</i>

582
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:24,234
The paradox is that there's beauty
in the filth.

583
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:28,359
- What else have you got?
- Good question.

584
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:32,275
I admire men with a strong sense
of self preservation.

585
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,401
However there is a limit.

586
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,025
What was wrong with the watch?

587
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,150
The most beautiful roses
come from the ugliest manure.

588
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,900
I feel like I'm on the couch.

589
00:35:58,609 --> 00:35:59,942
I still got a minute to go.

590
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,567
Anywhere it's a theory, I have no idea
if it has any credibility.

591
00:36:04,942 --> 00:36:07,567
Where did you get that from?
You got one for me?

592
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:32,025
Vincent, one more chance,
while your nose is still straight.

593
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:41,192
Which hand?

594
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:43,651
Left or the right?

595
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:51,298
It was right.

596
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:53,867
Now, if you don't mind
I'll take my watch back.

597
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:56,734
Yes, Sarah.
Good work. Wrap it up.

598
00:36:56,818 --> 00:37:01,150
Rich people if you hadn't noticed,
they like to show off.

599
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:05,818
- I'm gonna head back.
- Great chatting with you.

600
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:10,067
- What's your name again?
- Michaela.

601
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,192
- Have a great night.
- You too.

602
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,491
- What's next for Danny Francesco?
- My next film role?

603
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:18,779
Yeah, yeah.

604
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:23,317
I'm playing a mysterious
self-made billionaire

605
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:28,567
who goes on a transcendental journey
from material genius to spiritual giant.

606
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:31,192
That's a bit spooky, isn't it?

607
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:34,208
You just described me.

608
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,954
Idea, Danny, shush, idea.

609
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:40,067
Why don't you come spend
a little bit of time with me.

610
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,359
And do your research,
find your character, all of that.

611
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:45,275
Charlie?

612
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,495
Michaela. Success?

613
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,751
- Of course. Success?
<i>- Success.</i>

614
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,130
Be with you shortly.

615
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:54,264
<i>I will go rescue the movie star then.</i>

616
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,567
Good luck, Vincent.

617
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:09,213
Michaela, my darling, your boyfriend
wants to use me, don't know why,

618
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:11,275
as an inspiration for his next film.

619
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,362
Gave me an idea.

620
00:38:13,446 --> 00:38:15,599
Why don't you both come
and have a little vacation

621
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:17,483
in my Turkish villa this weekend.

622
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:20,859
And Danny gets to pick up some tips.

623
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:22,776
Shadow me, you know.

624
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,358
Do whatever I do. Wherever I do do.
What do I do?

625
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:30,442
- We'll find out.
- You will. Is that a good idea?

626
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:35,692
I mean I have a couple things going on
but I think I can rearrange some things.

627
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:40,025
You, Michaela, have a lot going on,
but what about this weekend?

628
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,227
- Gregory, how are you?
- Oh, Lord, look who's here.

629
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:46,401
<i>Privet, za zdorovje.</i>

630
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:50,596
We've been waiting for you
to introduce us to Danny Francesco.

631
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,490
Danny, I'd like you to meet
my very good friends,

632
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:55,870
Alexander, and Natalja,

633
00:38:55,954 --> 00:38:59,483
and Big Jev, and sulky Katja

634
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,959
and somewhat scary Dimitry.

635
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,816
Dimitry, nice to meet you.

636
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,776
Man, I'm such a fan, you mind if I...

637
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:07,767
- Selfie? Selfie time.
- Yes.

638
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,941
But be gentle with him.

639
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:12,484
- Go on then.
- Danny please.

640
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,118
This is fantastic.

641
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:21,317
Everyone just-- why don't you
just crowd around a little tighter.

642
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,676
- They are piranhas, aren't they?
- Yeah.

643
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,275
Now, that is a feeding frenzy.

644
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,234
- Another one.
- Okay...

645
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:30,485
He's gonna come out of there a skeleton.

646
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,150
<i>Just watch where you're putting
your hands, Dimitry.</i>

647
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:40,900
Why are you looking at me like that, Greg?

648
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:44,651
I think you know
why I'm looking at you like that.

649
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:48,900
And you know that I'm spoken for.

650
00:39:48,983 --> 00:39:51,637
I do, and I respect that. I do.

651
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:54,697
But will you allow me
to flatter you for a moment?

652
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:59,150
Danny is a famous actor,
and that is very impressive,

653
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:03,609
but actors all work for someone,
don't they?

654
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:08,526
You strike me as someone
who doesn't take orders.

655
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:11,324
No, shush, cause I'm talking.

656
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,998
I think you are a free spirit.

657
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:19,317
I'm not sure what that means.

658
00:40:19,401 --> 00:40:21,161
It's been a pleasure.
It's been an absolute--

659
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,952
Do you remember this movie
where you were kicking the bad guy--

660
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:28,025
Come here.

661
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,692
The world is a much, much bigger place
than you could possibly imagine.

662
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:43,150
Allow me to show it to you.

663
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,651
- Michaela.
- Hello, Charlie.

664
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,985
Does that superstar need rescuing?

665
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:57,483
Hey, Danny, shall we...?

666
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:00,942
Michaela, think about what I said, yeah?

667
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,253
Hey, look, Danny,
your manager is here to save you.

668
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,533
I gotta take him away before you
three bears chew the meat off his bones.

669
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:13,002
- Danny, take my hand.
- Danny, come on. Please.

670
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:16,567
Danny, Danny, stay, come on.

671
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:19,401
We love you so much, Daniel, my man.

672
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:21,004
I love you, man.

673
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:22,983
Look, this beautiful pictures. Look.

674
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:26,776
<i>Dimitry, your tongue is hanging out
and you hand is on his cock.</i>

675
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,317
Danny, you should be proud of yourself.

676
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:33,859
Yeah, looks like we maybe going away
for the weekend with Greggy.

677
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:36,651
You guys have to stop doing this to me.

678
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:40,095
I don't know if that was
the most exhilarating moment of my life

679
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,983
or the most terrifying moment of my life.

680
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:47,067
But Danny Francesco playing
Danny Francesco, that is the way forward.

681
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:07,182
<i>Congratulations team,
a successful evening.</i>

682
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:08,608
<i>Debrief at 07.00.</i>

683
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,609
Good work.

684
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:13,651
<i>- Well, well, Greg...
- Well, Alexander.</i>

685
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:19,859
At your new improved summer sale price,
that is the 10 billion dollars.

686
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:24,442
- We have a deal.
- Fantastic.

687
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:28,275
So, who's buying?

688
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:32,401
<i>I'm not telling you that.</i>

689
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:35,859
My job is to protect
every link in this chain.

690
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:40,025
So, I do protect them, yes,
but I'm also protecting you.

691
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,401
So, what happens now is that I tell them
that you are delighted,

692
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:47,859
and they will be delighted,
and then we can all be delighted together.

693
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:51,442
- We should celebrate.
- We should.

694
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:55,651
Emilia! Get of them
really stupid bottles of vodka.

695
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:58,298
You know, the one
with a five carat rock in the top.

696
00:42:58,382 --> 00:43:00,062
- You'll love that.
<i>- Da.</i>

697
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:04,569
I do wish you communicate
with your other departments.

698
00:43:04,653 --> 00:43:07,567
Someone is feeding Mike information,
inside information.

699
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:11,401
<i>It doesn't look like Mike is working
for anyone in this government.</i>

700
00:43:11,484 --> 00:43:15,567
I need more time to find out
which government he's working for.

701
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:17,859
Now, tell me what you have.

702
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:20,691
We still can't confirm it's the Handle,

703
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:22,996
what we do know is that Alexander
is selling something

704
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,442
for 10 billion dollars.

705
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:27,900
<i>- Greg Simmonds is brokering the deal.</i>
- And who's the buyer?

706
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:33,359
Still a mystery,
but it won't remain one for long.

707
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,942
<i>I think Orson is right.</i>

708
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:43,526
Greg has a thing for stealing girlfriends,
especially from movie stars.

709
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,816
So accept his offer to go away.

710
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,663
That's a vulnerable position.

711
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:50,356
I've dealt with much worse
than Greg Simmonds before, believe me.

712
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,526
Vulnerable?

713
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,442
Just be aware if they need to get out
quick it might not be that easy.

714
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:56,681
At some point the movie star
is gonna melt.

715
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:57,964
I'm sure he'll be fine.

716
00:43:58,048 --> 00:43:59,568
What did you find on Trent and Arnold?

717
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:03,468
Our biotech billionaires are buying up
an awful lot of gold.

718
00:44:03,552 --> 00:44:04,872
Other than that not a great deal.

719
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,713
At least we know
the Ukrainians are involved.

720
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:09,936
Whatever they're selling
has now got Greg very excited.

721
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,158
I found out where they're staying,
but their computers are impossible to hack

722
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:15,242
I don't know
how long it's gonna take me to get in.

723
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:17,317
Options?

724
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:20,567
Quickest way is to physically install
software on their computers.

725
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:24,027
You mean break in
and install via thumb drive?

726
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,108
Yes, that's the most direct way to do it.

727
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:27,946
This one's for you then.

728
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,734
Really? I thought I was a footman.

729
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:32,776
- No, tech-whizz.
- Yeah, and you're the hammer?

730
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:34,390
If there's a problem I'll do it.

731
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:35,890
No, there's no problem, JJ.

732
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:37,816
I'll do it.

733
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,125
I can get inside the Ukrainians.

734
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:42,232
I hope you take them to dinner first.

735
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,526
Before you get inside of them...

736
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:50,075
sexually.

737
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:58,776
<i>You are over the wall. Neatly done.</i>

738
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:05,859
And we are redirecting air con.

739
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:25,651
And they're all sleeping like babies now.
They're not gonna wake up any time soon.

740
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:28,150
<i>You are safe to enter.</i>

741
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,526
<i>Doors are opening now.</i>

742
00:45:46,983 --> 00:45:49,692
Up the stairs, first floor,
the bedroom on the left.

743
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,569
<i>Once you've installed the thumb drive</i>

744
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:02,567
<i>cover your tracks
and make it look like a robbery.</i>

745
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:07,359
<i>Swag some watches, cracketh the safe
and bag some cash, baby.</i>

746
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:10,942
<i>The more you bag the better it looks.</i>

747
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:31,526
<i>No time to watch TV, sweetheart.
Get to work.</i>

748
00:47:17,855 --> 00:47:22,349
<i>♪ Raindrops keep falling on my head ♪</i>

749
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:27,796
<i>♪ But that doesn't mean
my eyes will soon be turning red ♪</i>

750
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,191
<i>- Did you find the laptop?</i>
- Found.

751
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:37,567
Now I'd like you to plug in that drive
and slap Enter.

752
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:41,369
Whatever they control,
I can control better.

753
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:44,067
We have full access to their computer.

754
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:49,192
Now that you've sucked it dry,
return to safe.

755
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,567
There are still two guards patrolling.
Exit via the front door.

756
00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:12,859
Nicely done, sweetheart.
We'll pick you up at the front gate.

757
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,651
Don't move!

758
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:31,692
Don't--

759
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:55,234
- What's that?
- It's a guard dog.

760
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:58,526
Guard. Dog.

761
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:01,859
- I'm good with a dog.
- Lucky them.

762
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:05,776
- What about your mate?
- Power nap. He'll be alright in a minute.

763
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:09,275
Are you guys done? I heard a gun shot.

764
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:14,567
- Is anyone dead?
- Nah, not thanks to you.

765
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,776
- What?
- You said it was clear.

766
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:20,317
- I said the front was clear.
- I came out of a front.

767
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:24,234
They usually keep the Olympic-size
swimming pools in the back of the house.

768
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:36,150
Front, back, right, wrong.

769
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:38,900
Whatever. Anyway, shall we?

770
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,791
- JJ.
- Sir.

771
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:50,233
- Morning.
- Morning.

772
00:49:50,317 --> 00:49:53,275
- Sarah says I didn't miss much last night.
- In and out.

773
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,150
- So you weren't seen by anyone?
- Yes.

774
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:57,417
That's a "yes you weren't seen by anyone"?

775
00:49:57,501 --> 00:49:58,358
Yes.

776
00:49:58,442 --> 00:50:00,776
Or "yes you were seen by someone"?

777
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:02,983
- Yes.
- Childish.

778
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:05,047
Nothing you need to worry about, Nathan.

779
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:07,451
You just concentrate on your gluten-free
lactose intolerant

780
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:08,567
bunny stroking breakfast.

781
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:12,234
Boys, I pulled this off
the Ukrainian's laptop.

782
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:14,599
Looks like the deal's
all agreed to on their side

783
00:50:14,683 --> 00:50:16,775
and there's an escrow account linked.

784
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,442
- What are they selling?
- We still don't know.

785
00:50:19,526 --> 00:50:22,401
- So we could be wasting our time.
- Activity on Greg's phone.

786
00:50:22,484 --> 00:50:24,776
<i>- Yes?
- Greg, you're on speaker.</i>

787
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,401
I'm with Arnold, enjoying the view
from up here.

788
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,601
<i>You're back in Disneyland already?
Didn't know you're there, did you?</i>

789
00:50:31,685 --> 00:50:33,608
What'd you do, beam yourselves, eh?

790
00:50:33,692 --> 00:50:37,192
Don't go mad, darling,
yesterday I looked like a fucking candy.

791
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:41,816
You're lucky we made your party at all.
Your choice of friends is questionable.

792
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,525
You're not wrong, but I'd argue,
that they are acquaintances, not friends.

793
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:50,567
And yes, we did raise a lot of money
for the war orphans, thank you for caring.

794
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,491
Put a load of rich lowbrows
in a room together,

795
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:54,510
they'll always outbid one another

796
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:57,442
in the name of egotistical competition
and ostentation.

797
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:59,734
Which is kind of the point, Trent.

798
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:02,651
<i>Didn't have you down
as an angry anti-capitalist.</i>

799
00:51:02,734 --> 00:51:07,192
We are anti-capitalists.
Anti other capitalists.

800
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:10,603
I'll tell you what, boys,
I've got another call coming in.

801
00:51:10,687 --> 00:51:11,740
Thank you, my darling.

802
00:51:11,824 --> 00:51:13,025
<i>You better take it then.</i>

803
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:15,091
So, what was the point of this one?

804
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:18,523
- Just to check we're okay.
<i>- Yes, we are okay.</i>

805
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:22,025
<i>Just remember:
Yellow is the color, and gold is the game.</i>

806
00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:24,734
And I still love you. Will speak later.

807
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:27,774
- Hello, Qasim.
- Okay to talk?

808
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:28,858
<i>Go on.</i>

809
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,567
- I've just spoken to Aleksander.
- And? Everything set?

810
00:51:32,651 --> 00:51:34,520
<i>It's not easy getting an answer
out of him.</i>

811
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:36,816
<i>- He's in a terrible mood.
- Why?</i>

812
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,418
You know he prides himself
on his security?

813
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:42,317
A lone cat burglar got in last night.

814
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:46,025
<i>Gassed the house.
Cleared out all his cash and jewelry.</i>

815
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:50,484
<i>On leaving, Alexander's personal guards
stopped him.</i>

816
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,359
Don't move!

817
00:51:53,734 --> 00:51:55,734
I will shoot you!

818
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:58,786
Don't shoot! Don't hurt me.
Here are my hands.

819
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,816
Come on. Take my hands.

820
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,526
Hospitalized two of his guards.

821
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,192
No police. No prison. I've got kids.

822
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:08,609
One with the broken nose,
three cracked ribs...

823
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,359
He's crying for mama, not a problem.

824
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:14,442
<i>And two fucked nuts.</i>

825
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:31,651
Another one, a bullet in the foot.

826
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:33,275
You shot my foot!

827
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,359
No cry for mama.

828
00:52:38,942 --> 00:52:41,755
This is the kind of thing
I need to know about.

829
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,650
You dropped your chopsticks.
You got shit on your face.

830
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:47,442
<i>- Should I be worried?
- We are going to carry on.</i>

831
00:52:47,526 --> 00:52:49,891
I'm waiting on confirmation.

832
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:52,525
But they should be flying fowl
in 72 hours.

833
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:54,971
<i>- You keep me informed, Qasim.
- Will do.</i>

834
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:56,267
<i>Golly, golly then.</i>

835
00:52:56,351 --> 00:52:59,371
Flying fowl in 72 hours.
What the cuss does that mean?

836
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,025
I got a location on Qasim's phone.

837
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:03,667
If the Ukrainians are entering
another country illegally

838
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,650
they're gonna need help
avoiding any risks with the authorities.

839
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:11,816
- So where is this Qasim based?
- Antalya, Turkey.

840
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,954
Gobble, gobble.
That's flying fowl with a "w", not a "u."

841
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:20,457
Turkey borders Ukraine,
hence flying fowl, flying to Turkey.

842
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,941
A bit overreach?

843
00:53:22,025 --> 00:53:25,651
You'd think so,
except Qasim Amari is a diplomat,

844
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:28,435
located in the Turkish government
office in Antalya, Turkey.

845
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:29,650
I don't know how I do it.

846
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:34,150
- What a brain.
- Do I have a brain in there? She does.

847
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:37,275
Modern women,
what will they think of next?

848
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,192
So, looks like we're all flying fowl.

849
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:42,483
We'll track Qasim, see where he leads us.

850
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:44,606
Sarah, you go with Danny as planned

851
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,915
and find out from Greg
exactly what it is he's buying.

852
00:53:46,999 --> 00:53:48,275
We need a confirmation on that.

853
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,900
Explains why Greggy
is spending his weekend in Turkey.

854
00:53:59,317 --> 00:54:02,234
There's a term for being beaten
in four moves, Nathan.

855
00:54:02,317 --> 00:54:06,150
- Fool's mate.
- It wasn't four moves.

856
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:08,982
If you can get yourself out
of that little mess I've put you in

857
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:10,858
you can have a glass of this.

858
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:13,149
What do we got on Qasim, JJ?

859
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:16,175
Libya and therefore
based all over the world.

860
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:20,025
Met Greg Simmonds in the 2000s,
he put him on a payroll soon after.

861
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:24,192
Qasim's been greasing palms
and burying bodies for Greg ever since.

862
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:28,526
- Nice one, have a glass of this.
- Wine is not really my thing.

863
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:33,442
- Is that the 2004?
- You still in here? Aren't you busy enough?

864
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:37,038
- There's wine, and then there's wine.
- Don't force the poor man.

865
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:48,360
Congratulations, Doctor Frankenstein.
You've created another monster.

866
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:52,284
Nathan, you don't put fish oil
in a Ferrari.

867
00:55:13,867 --> 00:55:17,992
Little Miss Paradox...
She got in your head yet?

868
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:21,866
- Hey. Good to see you.
- You too.

869
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,191
There they are, my new best friends.

870
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:27,942
<i>Hosgeldiniz,</i> as we say in Turkey.

871
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:32,234
- Thank you for the jet.
- Don't be silly, that's the baby one.

872
00:55:32,317 --> 00:55:34,942
- Danny Francesco.
- It's good to see you, Greg.

873
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:37,422
Excited to be here,
to learn from the master.

874
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:40,025
No, I'm not the master.

875
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:44,179
Before we do anything else, follow me
cause I have something to show you.

876
00:55:44,263 --> 00:55:45,320
Grab a drink on a way.

877
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:48,595
75 Corniche, Greggy, I love it.

878
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,056
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
Present from Elton that one.

879
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:55,537
What a second, that looks exactly
like the car that I drove--

880
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,151
Do you know why? Do you know why?

881
00:55:58,526 --> 00:56:02,359
- That's not possible.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it is.

882
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,484
Lovingly restored with me own hands.

883
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:08,636
It's not really with me own hands,
I'm just joking.

884
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,416
It's nice though, isn't it?

885
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:14,859
Look at him!

886
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:17,609
- I drove this car myself.
- I know, honey.

887
00:56:17,692 --> 00:56:19,718
And, Michaela did his own stunts.

888
00:56:19,802 --> 00:56:21,066
- Is that true, Danny?
- Yeah.

889
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,609
- Could you still do them?
- I'm a little rusty, but sure.

890
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:27,692
Right, game on! After lunch, yes?

891
00:56:27,776 --> 00:56:31,234
Okay, I might have to sit that one out,
but you boys have fun.

892
00:56:31,317 --> 00:56:34,382
After lunch, Michaela
you are having the pleasure

893
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:38,692
of a four hands hot stones massage
with Suki and Sasha.

894
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:43,036
And they really, really understand
a lady's geography.

895
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,585
- Isn't that right, Emilia?
- Yes, they do.

896
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,109
Sounds fabulous.

897
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:50,442
- She looks nervous.
- Believe me, I'm not.

898
00:56:50,526 --> 00:56:52,142
You even have my prop gun!

899
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:55,506
Yeah, but it's not a prop anymore,
Danny, so steady there...

900
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:58,366
I cannot believe you got this car.

901
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,698
- I wanted this car so bad.
- Did you?

902
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:03,234
How much did you want it, Danny?

903
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:08,192
Of all the cars I've driven on screen,
this the only car I wanted to possess.

904
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:11,818
- Is that right, did you crave it?
- Yeah.

905
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,192
- Did you yearn for it?
- Yeah.

906
00:57:14,275 --> 00:57:17,818
- Did you dream about it?
- I longed for it.

907
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:21,820
Do you know what? It's yours.
Come, let's have lunch.

908
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,859
- What?
- It's yours.

909
00:57:28,192 --> 00:57:30,526
Come on!

910
00:57:31,776 --> 00:57:33,776
- Alright.
- Do you like kebabs?

911
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:39,050
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

912
00:57:39,134 --> 00:57:41,442
So you're carrying an empty bag?

913
00:57:41,526 --> 00:57:44,651
- You nicked the Margaux, didn't you?
- Nicked is a little bit strong.

914
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:47,093
We're leaving half the bottle
of Margaux on a plane?

915
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:48,353
So you're the doggie bag man?

916
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:49,853
Do you have any idea what it costs?

917
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:53,233
He has no idea how much it costs.
Short arms, long pockets.

918
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:54,692
Room keys.

919
00:57:54,776 --> 00:57:58,109
Be down here in 60 minutes.
We have to track the Libyan.

920
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:01,759
What are you doing? That's my key.

921
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:04,483
I know it is. I also know
you've given yourself the biggest room.

922
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:07,291
How do you know
I haven't already switched them?

923
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:10,564
Fuck off, Nathan.
You haven't got the bandwidth for that.

924
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:16,358
I can't believe it.
I'm in the car with the actor.

925
00:58:16,442 --> 00:58:18,864
Is the back end still bulletproof?
It feels a little squirrly.

926
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:20,608
Oh, yeah, you need selling points.

927
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:24,567
So, tell me, how did the leap from
millionaire to billionaire changed you.

928
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:26,483
Right, interesting question.

929
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:30,983
And I imagine, my cue to say money
doesn't make you happier.

930
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:34,275
But I'll tell you what, Danny.
It fucking does.

931
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:38,651
It does. I'm really happy now.
And a nicer person too.

932
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:42,192
I worry about things, I worry about
the world, I worry about war orphans.

933
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:45,234
You don't strike me as a worrier, Greg.

934
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:48,609
You don't strike me as someone
who drives like a little girly, but you do.

935
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,275
Oh, is that how it is?

936
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:58,734
Slow down, Danny Francesco!
You're driving me into my dreams!

937
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:24,359
Everything alright, Michaela?

938
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,067
Yeah, oh, my God, this place is massive.

939
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:35,150
And wow, this piece is beautiful.
"Mimar Sinan."

940
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:37,942
- Are you looking for your room?
- Yes!

941
00:59:38,025 --> 00:59:41,900
- My room is... that way.
- It's actually the other way.

942
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:43,382
Of course.

943
00:59:43,466 --> 00:59:46,233
Down the corridor turn right
and it's on your left.

944
00:59:46,317 --> 00:59:49,859
That massage was so good, by the way.
You should join us next time.

945
00:59:49,942 --> 00:59:53,810
- Turn right.
- Right. Got it.

946
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:55,567
Okay, I'll see you later.

947
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:09,883
- Qasim zapped.
- Do we follow him?

948
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:11,818
Not yet.

949
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,900
Looks like he's en route for a coffee.

950
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:26,859
- Oh, hello. How does he do it?
- Mike?

951
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:29,194
Doesn't matter how he's done it.
He's done it.

952
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:30,400
It's Mike, isn't it?

953
01:00:30,484 --> 01:00:32,401
How's he getting his information?

954
01:00:32,484 --> 01:00:35,859
<i>- Ground control.</i>
- Can you hear me, Major Tom?

955
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:37,818
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

956
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,818
<i>- How are we getting on?</i>
- Looping monitor...

957
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,330
They have some of adolescent firewall.

958
01:00:44,414 --> 01:00:47,239
It'll take me
about a minute to perforate it.

959
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:49,531
Done.

960
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,275
It's like he's got enough of that paper.
Qasim's off and Mike's going with him.

961
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,818
- Are we following?
- No, let Mike play that game.

962
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,433
- My money's on the paper.
- Whatever you say, boss.

963
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:05,660
Want an ice cream?

964
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:17,692
- And I am in.
- Great.

965
01:01:17,776 --> 01:01:20,234
- What's he buying?
- Hold on.

966
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:24,692
I've picked up a file sent by Qasim.
He's using RSA encryption.

967
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:29,692
- That's disappointing.
<i>- What?</i>

968
01:01:29,776 --> 01:01:36,025
It looks like Greg's up to no good. But...
Not spectacularly no good, just no good.

969
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,369
Don't be mean, Sarah, give me something.

970
01:01:38,453 --> 01:01:41,317
Greg is buying
containers of stolen AK-47s.

971
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:43,955
Yes, very funny.
Now seriously, what is it?

972
01:01:44,049 --> 01:01:45,233
I am serious.

973
01:01:45,317 --> 01:01:48,234
We've got it wrong. See for yourself.

974
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:59,192
Oh, hello. We've seen him before.

975
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:05,359
- Shall we?
- I get the ice creams, you get the wheel.

976
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:10,484
<i>Can't be, Sarah. All that fuss
over 30 million dollars worth of guns?</i>

977
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:12,335
<i>It's too small of a crime
for two bigger players.</i>

978
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,271
<i>If it's a cover it's a very good one.</i>

979
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,168
<i>It's enough evidence to feel his collar,
but not enough to choke him with it.</i>

980
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:22,067
Understood, but there is nothing
linking this deal to the Handle.

981
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:25,192
Poo. Alright, get out of there
and get back as soon as you can.

982
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:27,911
Let me just dig a bit deeper

983
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:30,858
and find some evidence
we can hold over him for a rainy day.

984
01:02:30,942 --> 01:02:33,109
<i>Okay, but be quick.</i>

985
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:36,275
- Orson, you there?
<i>- What is it?</i>

986
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:38,401
Time to come in. We were wrong.

987
01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:41,627
It's not the Handle, it's fire arms.
We're following the wrong rabbit.

988
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:43,692
You go back to bed, leave this with me.

989
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:47,067
Sarah showed me proof.
Forget it. We're done.

990
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:52,025
I don't think so. We're back
with our old friend, Ben Harris.

991
01:02:52,109 --> 01:02:56,484
If Greg has Ben involved, there's no way
that this deal is about guns.

992
01:02:56,567 --> 01:03:01,317
<i>Alright, follow him, but do not engage.
I'll let Sarah know we're still in play.</i>

993
01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:16,148
<i>- You got me, JJ?</i>
- I've got a lock on you, boss.

994
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:29,734
<i>- Do we pick him up?</i>
- No, cat follows mouse.

995
01:03:42,025 --> 01:03:45,025
<i>- Can you get a lock onto his phone?</i>
- Yeah, if you get close enough.

996
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:49,179
<i>Stay within 50 meters, I can use
your phone to lock onto his signal.</i>

997
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,567
Quicker if he uses it.

998
01:03:50,651 --> 01:03:52,627
Get close enough to raise suspicion.

999
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:54,639
<i>But not too close or we bounce.</i>

1000
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:57,210
<i>That'll initiate him activating his phone.</i>

1001
01:04:00,275 --> 01:04:03,484
Are we being followed?

1002
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:08,067
BAD SMELL BEHIND ME

1003
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,983
<i>He's sent a text. I've blocked it.</i>

1004
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:17,330
I've got him. I've locked on.
I've blocked his call.

1005
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:20,983
Can't get through. No signal.

1006
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:27,234
- Deal with that.
- Yes, sir.

1007
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:32,484
- Are you lost?
- Thank you, sir. Maybe you can help me.

1008
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:36,734
- I'm looking for the harbor.
- This way, sir.

1009
01:04:42,025 --> 01:04:44,484
<i>Hang on,
I've just jammed another message.</i>

1010
01:04:46,109 --> 01:04:49,900
We're burned.
He's recognized you.

1011
01:04:49,983 --> 01:04:52,776
That's strange...

1012
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:57,776
Because according to the map,
it says this way.

1013
01:04:57,859 --> 01:05:00,442
No, this way, sir.

1014
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:08,401
Amazing, you're absolutely right.
Thank you.

1015
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,900
You've gotta pick him up. He's gonna run.

1016
01:05:38,317 --> 01:05:41,404
<i>Orson, if he gets out of the range
I can't block his signal.</i>

1017
01:05:41,488 --> 01:05:42,488
<i>Get after him.</i>

1018
01:05:51,942 --> 01:05:54,900
<i>He's in the building on the left.</i>

1019
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:06,442
<i>He's 10 meters straight in front of you.</i>

1020
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:18,454
JJ, he's on two wheels, talk to me.

1021
01:06:18,538 --> 01:06:20,088
Fifteen meters. Take a right.

1022
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:32,300
- Left or right, JJ?
- Sharp left.

1023
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:33,618
He's getting out of range.

1024
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:00,935
<i>JJ, speak to me.</i>

1025
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:03,355
He's stopped moving.
He's right in front of you.

1026
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:12,150
- Missed him. Stairs?
<i>- Take a right.</i>

1027
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:24,317
Afternoon.

1028
01:07:29,644 --> 01:07:33,560
Excuse me, would you take
a picture of me and the view?

1029
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,922
They're only stairs,
go on, move yourself.

1030
01:07:38,006 --> 01:07:39,983
<i>Next time I'll sit in the car,
you do the chase.</i>

1031
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:42,401
Let me take a look.

1032
01:07:45,442 --> 01:07:48,900
Beautiful. Give me your phone,
let me take one for you.

1033
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,567
He's still there.

1034
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:03,620
There's no one here.

1035
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:07,667
<i>I'm telling you he's right there.
You're on top of his phone now.</i>

1036
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:12,025
Oh, Jesus, what'd you do that for?

1037
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:13,442
<i>Hold on, I'm just pulling up.</i>

1038
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:18,150
There is a body all over the floor
200 feet below me. It's Harris.

1039
01:08:18,234 --> 01:08:23,942
Get the phone, the paper.
And get the body in the back.

1040
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:32,983
- That's not Ben Harris.
- What you mean that's not Ben Harris?

1041
01:08:40,776 --> 01:08:42,442
That's Ben Harris.

1042
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,067
- Is he in the back?
- Yeah, he's in the back.

1043
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:03,734
<i>So, Nathan, can you confirm?</i>

1044
01:09:04,776 --> 01:09:07,692
The file Sarah extracted
from Greg's computer

1045
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,841
was actually the data key
that unlocked the Bakker drive,

1046
01:09:10,925 --> 01:09:12,608
confirming it is the Handle.

1047
01:09:12,692 --> 01:09:17,234
- So what is it?
- It's a first of its kind programmable AI.

1048
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:20,983
Our people had hoped
it was still in the post.

1049
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:24,150
Now it seems the post has been delivered.

1050
01:09:24,234 --> 01:09:27,734
It can hack any system,
even other AI programs.

1051
01:09:27,818 --> 01:09:29,859
- With what end?
<i>- To any end.</i>

1052
01:09:29,942 --> 01:09:31,709
It could launch a nuclear strike

1053
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:35,775
and then cover its own tracks pointing
the finger at whomever it wants to blame.

1054
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:40,150
<i>Whatever is run by a computer
it can control.</i>

1055
01:09:40,234 --> 01:09:44,567
And we still don't know
what they intend to use it for.

1056
01:09:44,651 --> 01:09:46,091
<i>Yes, but we can at least now confirm</i>

1057
01:09:46,171 --> 01:09:48,483
<i>that Aleksander
is indeed selling the Handle</i>

1058
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:51,910
<i>with Greg Simmonds brokering
the deal for 10 billion dollars.</i>

1059
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:53,881
Confirmed.

1060
01:09:53,965 --> 01:09:55,400
Sir, what now?

1061
01:09:55,484 --> 01:09:58,983
- When the transaction is gonna take place?
- Deal's set for 9 a.m.

1062
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:02,900
Between the newspaper
and info extracted from his phone.

1063
01:10:02,983 --> 01:10:06,746
<i>Ben Harris was to be picked up
from Hotel Amara's lobby</i>

1064
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,816
<i>by Alexander's representative.</i>

1065
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,526
<i>And taken to the exchange
to transfer the escrow.</i>

1066
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,109
But he still needs to call Greg
to get a 15-digit passcode.

1067
01:10:15,192 --> 01:10:20,317
So, inconveniently
we do still need Ben Harris.

1068
01:10:20,401 --> 01:10:22,816
Could've done without him dying,
but still.

1069
01:10:22,903 --> 01:10:24,150
Childish.

1070
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:27,567
- Can we make me Ben Harris?
- Go on.

1071
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:29,600
They don't know what he looks like.

1072
01:10:29,694 --> 01:10:32,941
<i>He guarded his visual identity
very closely.</i>

1073
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:34,466
<i>- Mr. Harris?</i>
- Yes.

1074
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,917
<i>There is a green G-wagon outside.
My men will escort you.</i>

1075
01:10:40,734 --> 01:10:42,559
I'll do the deal myself.

1076
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:45,359
But you'll have to talk
to Greg on the phone.

1077
01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:59,567
It's a pleasure to meet with you,
Mr. Harris. Your phone, please.

1078
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:05,567
- Anything else?
- Nothing else.

1079
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:09,900
- Do you mind?
- Please.

1080
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:20,202
I can make you look like him
but I can't make you sound like him.

1081
01:11:20,286 --> 01:11:21,609
Don't we know someone who can?

1082
01:11:22,526 --> 01:11:26,776
I'll tell you what, Danny, Michaela,
it's a gift. It is a gift.

1083
01:11:26,859 --> 01:11:29,432
My dad had it.
It's like a party trick for him.

1084
01:11:29,516 --> 01:11:32,608
Didn't matter what it was.
Could be a toy, could be a pair of shoes.

1085
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:36,108
He could put his hand on it,
shut his eyes and tell you the price.

1086
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:37,692
He'd do $14.99.

1087
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:39,342
He could. He could do that.

1088
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:42,066
Please don't stop on my account.
I have to use a little girls room.

1089
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,109
Yes, my darling,
you know where it is, don't you?

1090
01:11:44,192 --> 01:11:49,150
Yes, it's straight past Mimar Sinan
and right at Timur.

1091
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:52,776
- She's funny isn't she?
- She's great.

1092
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:53,889
You are very lucky.

1093
01:11:53,973 --> 01:11:56,863
Right, so roof comes down.
Watch this. Roof comes down.

1094
01:11:58,275 --> 01:12:01,174
You say: "Relax, relax Mr. Steak."

1095
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:02,834
There, he is all calm now.

1096
01:12:07,234 --> 01:12:10,293
<i>Sarah, regrettably
Ben Harris has passed away.</i>

1097
01:12:10,377 --> 01:12:11,941
- When?
<i>- Couple of hours ago.</i>

1098
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:14,956
<i>Orson encouraged him to jump off
an extremely tall building.</i>

1099
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:15,899
Poor guy.

1100
01:12:15,983 --> 01:12:17,666
<i>Can you make him sound like Harris?</i>

1101
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,686
Have you sourced
any existing voice recordings?

1102
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:20,941
<i>Yes.</i>

1103
01:12:21,025 --> 01:12:24,122
In which case upload them and send
them to me and I can do that.

1104
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:25,025
<i>How?</i>

1105
01:12:25,109 --> 01:12:27,355
- The vocoder works in real time.
<i>- Clever.</i>

1106
01:12:27,548 --> 01:12:28,717
That's AI for you, Nathan.

1107
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:29,804
<i>One last thing...</i>

1108
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:33,231
<i>I need you to confirm you still have
full access to Aleksander's network?</i>

1109
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:36,776
Confirmed.

1110
01:12:39,942 --> 01:12:43,234
Make yourself comfortable.
There is water in the door.

1111
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:12,859
- So far, so good.
- Okay. Keep in touch, JJ.

1112
01:13:12,942 --> 01:13:15,622
Now, you two, you're gonna
have to entertain yourselves for an hour.

1113
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:17,066
Cause I gotta make a work call.

1114
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:20,272
That's right. I guess I could use
a little nappy poo myself, so...

1115
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:22,775
- I'll join you for your nappy poo.
- Yeah?

1116
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:25,818
Change of plan.
Danny, you make the work call.

1117
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,637
I'll take the nappy poo.
Michaela, you join me.

1118
01:13:28,721 --> 01:13:30,227
Greggy...

1119
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,692
They're going off road. I'm parking up.

1120
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:05,526
He's the real deal.
He's supper impressive.

1121
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:08,025
And he's so into you.

1122
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:10,474
I mean, if you're not interested
in him I might be.

1123
01:14:10,558 --> 01:14:12,608
Fill your boots.

1124
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:13,844
What are you doing?

1125
01:14:13,928 --> 01:14:16,525
I need to make Orson
sound like Greg's lawyer.

1126
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:18,067
Why?

1127
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:21,317
Because Ben Harris is dead
and we need him alive for the arms deal.

1128
01:14:21,401 --> 01:14:24,322
Ben Harris is dead? When did that happen?
And who killed him?

1129
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:26,164
That's not something
you need to worry about.

1130
01:14:26,188 --> 01:14:28,959
What you need to worry is how much
longer we have until we're found out.

1131
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:30,479
Found out?

1132
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:34,942
I know you're having a billionaire
love affair. It's very sweet.

1133
01:14:35,032 --> 01:14:36,152
But we have about 20 minutes

1134
01:14:36,228 --> 01:14:39,296
before Greg's security
blows our fucking brains out.

1135
01:14:41,776 --> 01:14:42,679
What do I do?

1136
01:14:42,763 --> 01:14:44,899
I suggest you get ready
for your next scene.

1137
01:14:44,983 --> 01:14:47,401
- Which is?
- The getaway.

1138
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:51,359
Right. I know how to do that. Action time.

1139
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:52,734
Right.

1140
01:14:52,818 --> 01:14:55,025
- I'll see you in the garage.
- Okay, darling.

1141
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:17,359
They will be here soon.

1142
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,692
I'm on.

1143
01:16:05,942 --> 01:16:07,900
- Sergi.
- Boss.

1144
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:12,859
<i>I'm in place.</i>

1145
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:15,818
Mr. Harris, I assume?

1146
01:16:18,567 --> 01:16:21,526
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

1147
01:16:26,609 --> 01:16:28,859
Here we are.

1148
01:16:31,143 --> 01:16:33,985
<i>Your people have confirmed
that the product is authentic.</i>

1149
01:16:34,076 --> 01:16:35,626
<i>I present the Handle.</i>

1150
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,818
I need my phone.

1151
01:16:50,983 --> 01:16:53,626
Yes, Benjamin bunny.

1152
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,446
Mr. Simmonds, we're connected.

1153
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:01,983
- Alright.
- We're good.

1154
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:09,150
The 15-digit passcode.

1155
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:13,401
A moment of privacy please.

1156
01:17:13,484 --> 01:17:16,816
- Emilia...
- What is it?

1157
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,859
There seems to be some sort
of break in on our internet security.

1158
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:23,750
<i>Just waiting for the system
to go online.</i>

1159
01:17:23,834 --> 01:17:25,025
Hold in.

1160
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:27,776
I've been trying to make it for days.

1161
01:17:27,859 --> 01:17:30,651
It's like someone hacked in
but keep dropping in and out.

1162
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:32,480
Who's hacking in?

1163
01:17:32,634 --> 01:17:35,049
The signal is coming
from within the compound.

1164
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:38,859
Ready for the 15-digit code.

1165
01:17:38,942 --> 01:17:42,067
Right, here we go.

1166
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,123
<i>Two, six, two.</i>

1167
01:17:45,234 --> 01:17:47,776
<i>Harris is transferring now, stand by.</i>

1168
01:17:47,859 --> 01:17:50,734
- Update.
- It's happening.

1169
01:17:50,818 --> 01:17:52,776
Put it here...

1170
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:54,550
Check the monitors, show me where.

1171
01:17:54,634 --> 01:17:56,710
The signal's bouncing all around
the server, I can't lock it down.

1172
01:17:56,734 --> 01:18:01,150
<i>Squiggly dash, eight, five...</i>

1173
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:02,365
<i>Nine.</i>

1174
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,484
Small letter "b" for bullocks...

1175
01:18:06,317 --> 01:18:09,067
<i>Five, six...</i>

1176
01:18:10,234 --> 01:18:13,275
<i>Five, five, comma...</i>

1177
01:18:14,401 --> 01:18:16,401
Big "c" for clit.

1178
01:18:19,734 --> 01:18:23,900
- It happened.
<i>- Ponytail, 11 o'clock.</i>

1179
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:27,900
Show me Greg's office.
I know Greg's in there. Why is it empty?

1180
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:29,435
- Got it?
<i>- All done.</i>

1181
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:30,650
Transaction complete.

1182
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:34,484
Ben, hurry home,
don't talk to strangers.

1183
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:41,401
Check all communication in and out
of the villa in the past 24 hours.

1184
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:45,317
<i>- He doesn't like you.
- It's the guard from the villa.</i>

1185
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:49,150
<i>- I'm on him.</i>
- Payment confirmed.

1186
01:18:50,776 --> 01:18:55,859
- Ten billion. Confirmed.
- Confirmed.

1187
01:18:55,942 --> 01:18:59,025
<i>-Mazel tov</i>
-Confirmed.

1188
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,942
Ponytail's lodging a complaint.

1189
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:05,317
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Harris.</i>
- Stop!

1190
01:19:05,401 --> 01:19:07,442
This is not Ben Harris!

1191
01:19:07,526 --> 01:19:09,234
Helicopters! Incoming.

1192
01:19:09,317 --> 01:19:12,401
- Shoot him!
- JJ?

1193
01:19:38,067 --> 01:19:42,025
<i>- Sarah, update.</i>
- I'm just unconfirming their confirmation.

1194
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:45,900
- What's happening?
- It was confirmed!

1195
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:03,275
JJ, who are these people? Find out.

1196
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:06,025
- Give me a moment.
<i>- Thirty seconds!</i>

1197
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:09,692
- I don't understand...
- What don't you understand?

1198
01:20:09,776 --> 01:20:11,651
It's gone.

1199
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:27,421
Just don't tell me it's Mike.

1200
01:20:27,505 --> 01:20:29,675
<i>Understood. Then I won't.</i>

1201
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:33,900
- Who is it?
- I'm not allowed to tell you.

1202
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:37,609
Fuck! Give me that fucking radio!

1203
01:20:37,692 --> 01:20:40,415
- I have Orson under control.
- Get that gun out of my face.

1204
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:42,650
Give me the fucking radio!

1205
01:20:42,734 --> 01:20:46,900
- Are you up there in the chopper, Mike?
- Orson, you sound upset.

1206
01:20:46,983 --> 01:20:50,192
Don't you worry about me, Mike,
I'm having a lovely time.

1207
01:20:50,275 --> 01:20:52,818
What seems to be the problem,
engine trouble?

1208
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:56,526
<i>Don't concern yourself.
I'll give you the busfare home.</i>

1209
01:20:56,609 --> 01:20:58,317
My boys will take over from here.

1210
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,734
Come on...

1211
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:10,609
Who are you?

1212
01:21:12,818 --> 01:21:14,609
Who are you, Michaela?

1213
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:18,359
How did you do it?

1214
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:22,317
This thing between us.

1215
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:26,567
Is strong, innit?

1216
01:21:26,651 --> 01:21:31,109
Do you know what the Turks call it?
<i>Kivilcim.</i> It means fire.

1217
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,303
<i>They say the gods would be furious
if you put it out.</i>

1218
01:21:35,402 --> 01:21:36,983
<i>But you know what I'm gonna do.</i>

1219
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:40,706
I'm going to put it out, Michaela
because of Danny.

1220
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,899
He's a friend and I respect him.

1221
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:48,150
And it's the right thing to do.
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.

1222
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:52,692
No, it's fine. I'll see you at dinner.

1223
01:22:01,818 --> 01:22:06,109
Find any survivors. Tie them up,
beat them up, bring them here.

1224
01:22:06,192 --> 01:22:09,025
I will be back in the air asap.

1225
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:15,818
Orson, you know why I'm here. Let's not
make this any messier than it needs to be.

1226
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,776
So don't be a bad girl.
Just surrender my prize.

1227
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:22,317
You want it so bad, you get your ass
down here and get it yourself.

1228
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:26,485
I have people to do that for me.

1229
01:22:26,569 --> 01:22:29,941
Ah, here he is.
Keeping a safe distance as usual?

1230
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:32,045
You're a spineless, jellyfish Mike.

1231
01:22:32,129 --> 01:22:34,317
- Yatom, get the case.
- I'm on it.

1232
01:22:34,401 --> 01:22:39,692
Go on, it's yours. You're not taking it.
I'm giving it to you.

1233
01:22:44,109 --> 01:22:46,859
What the heck? What's this?

1234
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,192
- He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
- It's okay. Relax, relax.

1235
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:54,942
Oh, it's a selfie! Okay!

1236
01:22:55,025 --> 01:22:56,818
Who is gonna tell me what's going on?

1237
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,339
We think they hacked into
our secure server.

1238
01:22:59,423 --> 01:23:00,899
It's not that secure then, is it?

1239
01:23:00,983 --> 01:23:02,530
It's worse than that I'm afraid.

1240
01:23:02,614 --> 01:23:05,143
Whoever you think you were
on the phone to before you weren't.

1241
01:23:06,275 --> 01:23:09,921
<i>- Ready for the 15-digit passcode.</i>
- What are you on about, that's Ben.

1242
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,150
<i>Ready for the 15-digit passcode.</i>

1243
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:15,923
You stop Danny Francesco
and whoever the fuck that is. Do it now!

1244
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:16,858
Do it now!

1245
01:23:16,942 --> 01:23:20,442
- Get after that car. Bring them back to me!
<i>- Understood.</i>

1246
01:23:29,442 --> 01:23:32,651
- We good?
- Yes, we got it.

1247
01:23:32,734 --> 01:23:34,484
Check the case, John.

1248
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:44,339
You have the case,
so why are we on our knees?

1249
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:46,293
You won't be on your knees
for long, my friend.

1250
01:23:46,317 --> 01:23:50,818
Orson, there's something strange
going on up here.

1251
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,067
- It's good, boss.
- Good.

1252
01:24:07,192 --> 01:24:08,875
The temperature's changed.

1253
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:11,909
<i>Mike's gone rogue,
he's executed the Ukrainian.</i>

1254
01:24:13,692 --> 01:24:17,609
- We got what we need, Connors?
- Yes, boss.

1255
01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:20,150
Kill Orson.

1256
01:24:21,609 --> 01:24:24,401
- They're gonna kill you now.
- Shoot them first then.

1257
01:24:33,983 --> 01:24:36,609
I'm not just good with dogs.

1258
01:24:40,025 --> 01:24:41,859
Tardy.

1259
01:24:41,942 --> 01:24:44,025
There's a chopper
with a dead pilot up here.

1260
01:24:44,109 --> 01:24:46,025
- I'll meet you there.
- Incoming.

1261
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:47,858
<i>- Nathan?</i>
- Yes.

1262
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:50,337
<i>Nathan, we're being chased
by Greg's security.</i>

1263
01:24:50,421 --> 01:24:52,644
Then get unchased.

1264
01:24:54,872 --> 01:24:58,831
Good news, the back is bulletproof,
bad news, I can't control the back end.

1265
01:25:06,526 --> 01:25:10,567
- You any good in one of these?
- It's been a while.

1266
01:25:10,651 --> 01:25:14,818
But I'll feel my way. It's only a chopper.

1267
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:20,942
Feeling my way.

1268
01:25:30,025 --> 01:25:32,651
You think you could put your foot down?

1269
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:42,067
- What are you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna shoot at them, Danny.

1270
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:44,484
I think I can help you out with that.

1271
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,651
I'm outta bullets.

1272
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:05,067
<i>- Nathan, are you there?</i>
- Yes. What is it?

1273
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:08,000
Your friend Mike appeared again,
but this time he's turned.

1274
01:26:08,084 --> 01:26:09,084
Turned?

1275
01:26:09,109 --> 01:26:11,909
<i>He's executed the Ukrainians
and taken the AI.</i>

1276
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,163
Going after him in a chopper.

1277
01:26:19,526 --> 01:26:21,269
<i>Did the other two get out okay?</i>

1278
01:26:21,353 --> 01:26:24,451
Don't worry about them.
They can take care of themselves.

1279
01:26:26,275 --> 01:26:28,900
The road's closed!

1280
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:37,542
<i>What happened?</i>

1281
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:40,141
Cover's blown, Greg's security
are in pursuit.

1282
01:26:40,225 --> 01:26:42,191
You just focus on retrieving
the case from Mike.

1283
01:26:42,275 --> 01:26:47,484
- Find out where they are.
- Already on it. Two minutes south west.

1284
01:27:12,526 --> 01:27:14,900
They're going in the tunnel.

1285
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,588
Do you know how to use
these rocket launchers?

1286
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,692
Can't be too complicated.

1287
01:27:26,776 --> 01:27:29,359
F for forward, R for rocket.

1288
01:27:30,818 --> 01:27:33,234
I think we're in trouble here.

1289
01:27:34,484 --> 01:27:36,567
Oops.

1290
01:27:45,567 --> 01:27:47,264
I think R is for rear.

1291
01:27:47,348 --> 01:27:50,358
I think I've worked that out now,
thank you, JJ.

1292
01:27:50,442 --> 01:27:53,317
Let's hope there's two more seats
in that chopper.

1293
01:28:01,316 --> 01:28:04,463
Knighton has confirmed,
Mike is not working for any government.

1294
01:28:04,547 --> 01:28:05,858
He's been working independently.

1295
01:28:05,942 --> 01:28:09,692
- Ain't that a surprise?
<i>- You need to track him down.</i>

1296
01:28:09,776 --> 01:28:12,882
You track him down,
we're going back to Greg's.

1297
01:28:12,966 --> 01:28:14,225
- We are?
- You are?

1298
01:28:14,309 --> 01:28:18,150
- We are?
- We are? I can't go back to Greg's.

1299
01:28:18,234 --> 01:28:22,686
Danny, nothing to worry about,
JJ is taking care of you.

1300
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:23,770
Sit down, Danny.

1301
01:28:23,818 --> 01:28:26,512
You might wanna see Greg
but I don't think Greg wants to see you.

1302
01:28:26,596 --> 01:28:27,974
<i>That's where you're wrong, Nathan.</i>

1303
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:29,983
I am exactly who he wants to see.

1304
01:28:30,067 --> 01:28:32,566
He knows Sarah downloaded
enough information on him

1305
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,025
to throw away the key.

1306
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:37,109
I'll find some evidence
we can hold over him for a rainy day.

1307
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:40,109
So, Greg now works for us.

1308
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:44,041
JJ, tell Greg we're coming in.
We have an offer he can't refuse.

1309
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:45,775
He'd be expecting the call.

1310
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:50,567
- Whatever you say, boss.
- Can we drop me off first?

1311
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:54,317
Nothing to worry about, Danny.
Greg's in love with you.

1312
01:28:54,401 --> 01:28:56,790
- Would you buckle up?
- Sit down, Danny.

1313
01:29:29,775 --> 01:29:34,066
If you are wondering
whether I'm feeling something of a tit,

1314
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:36,275
the answer is yes, I am.

1315
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:39,067
- Is it humiliating, Emilia?
- Yes.

1316
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:41,667
Do we still think
we can maybe make a deal?

1317
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,025
- Yes.
- Yes, we do.

1318
01:29:43,109 --> 01:29:46,861
Which is not to take away
from the genius of your plan,

1319
01:29:46,945 --> 01:29:48,525
Orson Fortune.

1320
01:29:48,609 --> 01:29:51,109
That is a sexy name. It is.

1321
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:55,234
You must fancy him a bit.
Fake Michaela...

1322
01:29:56,114 --> 01:29:58,818
I still fancy you a bit.

1323
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:03,432
But what you've done using him as bait.

1324
01:30:03,516 --> 01:30:06,775
Celebrity Trojan horse.
That's brilliant. It's classy.

1325
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:11,192
Not so classy though
is your competitor, Mike,

1326
01:30:11,275 --> 01:30:14,983
comes barreling in,
pretending to be mister law in order.

1327
01:30:15,067 --> 01:30:19,734
Steals your thunder
and potentially my commission.

1328
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:25,150
- You can keep your commission, Gregory.
- Oh yeah?

1329
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:29,530
Oh, yeah. You can keep your commission,
you can keep your reputation,

1330
01:30:29,614 --> 01:30:31,025
your liberty...

1331
01:30:31,109 --> 01:30:33,445
Because you're gonna donate
your said commission

1332
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:35,779
to your favorite charity, Orphans of War.

1333
01:30:38,818 --> 01:30:41,025
Oh... Am I?

1334
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:46,484
- Who's your buyer, Greg?
- I never reveal my buyers, Orson.

1335
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:52,025
- Emilia, tell them.
- You remember Trent and Arnold?

1336
01:30:52,109 --> 01:30:55,526
Would you care to meet Trent and Arnold.

1337
01:30:55,609 --> 01:30:57,983
- The biotech billionaire friends?
- Yeah, that's it.

1338
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:03,109
As we speak they are using
your precious programmable AI

1339
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:06,128
the Handle, I believe you call it,

1340
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:08,525
in conjunction
with a concept of satellites.

1341
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:11,692
Enjoying the view from up here.

1342
01:31:11,776 --> 01:31:15,526
Purpose - to trip up
the world's banking system.

1343
01:31:15,609 --> 01:31:18,311
So that's why they're buying up
40 billion dollars worth of gold

1344
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:21,775
while simultaneously
trying to cover their tracks?

1345
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:22,951
That's exactly it, Orson.

1346
01:31:23,035 --> 01:31:24,194
By the time they are finished

1347
01:31:24,218 --> 01:31:27,191
gold is the only thing
you'll be able to buy a sticky book with.

1348
01:31:27,275 --> 01:31:30,452
- You're taking us there, Greg.
- I could.

1349
01:31:30,536 --> 01:31:32,198
And I reckon
I can get through the door

1350
01:31:32,282 --> 01:31:35,217
because I've got something
they can't ignore,

1351
01:31:35,301 --> 01:31:37,983
namely a comprehensive insurance policy.

1352
01:31:38,067 --> 01:31:41,109
But I do worry about your invitation.

1353
01:31:41,192 --> 01:31:44,900
Trent and Arnold have rented themselves
a very nasty little private army.

1354
01:31:44,983 --> 01:31:46,942
You let me worry about that.

1355
01:31:47,025 --> 01:31:49,526
Just one last thing.

1356
01:31:52,317 --> 01:31:56,484
I would kill to see you in action.

1357
01:31:57,567 --> 01:32:00,192
Oh, Danny...

1358
01:32:00,275 --> 01:32:02,983
How can I say no?

1359
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,818
So, what are they going to do
with this Handle?

1360
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:18,609
The Handle would be
a financial atomic bomb.

1361
01:32:18,692 --> 01:32:22,047
<i>It will create a digital glitch
in a world's banking system.</i>

1362
01:32:22,141 --> 01:32:23,775
<i>May last only a few minutes,</i>

1363
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:27,942
<i>but that will be enough for trust
to evaporate in conventional markets.</i>

1364
01:32:28,025 --> 01:32:30,581
Gold will, like always...

1365
01:32:31,878 --> 01:32:35,447
would be the only remaining currency
with any credibility.

1366
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:38,109
Its value rising exponentially.

1367
01:32:38,192 --> 01:32:42,859
Anarchy would follow
while the world reorganizes itself.

1368
01:32:43,942 --> 01:32:49,109
Well, Nathan... now it's time
for your man to prove his worth.

1369
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:55,692
Clear the room.

1370
01:32:55,776 --> 01:32:57,942
- Anita.
- Yes, Mr. Knighton.

1371
01:32:58,025 --> 01:33:00,150
Get the PM on the line.

1372
01:33:10,025 --> 01:33:14,109
And the bird is up.
We'll have eyes soon.

1373
01:33:16,942 --> 01:33:19,983
<i>And Greg and Danny have arrived.</i>

1374
01:33:24,567 --> 01:33:27,359
The floor is yours. Method?

1375
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:31,317
Blitzkrieg.
Get them before they count the first body.

1376
01:33:31,401 --> 01:33:33,526
I like it.

1377
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:38,734
- I'll cover you. There are blind spots.
- That's what the birds for, JJ.

1378
01:33:38,818 --> 01:33:42,317
JJ... shoot straight.

1379
01:33:47,942 --> 01:33:49,442
Leave it with me, boss.

1380
01:34:07,818 --> 01:34:10,818
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

1381
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:13,818
- Nervous?
- No.

1382
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,484
Remember your lines?
You only got two.

1383
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:24,609
- Did you got the bit about the lights?
- Yes.

1384
01:34:25,609 --> 01:34:29,567
One more thing, Danny.
Lose the shades.

1385
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,484
And we are back.

1386
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:43,067
With four guards by the pagoda.
I am blocking their comms.

1387
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,150
Blocked.

1388
01:34:45,234 --> 01:34:48,609
I have the two on the right.

1389
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,859
Hello, boys. Hello.

1390
01:35:02,192 --> 01:35:05,526
A lot of very serious faces down here.

1391
01:35:05,609 --> 01:35:08,158
You remember those two, don't you?
Trent and Arnold.

1392
01:35:08,242 --> 01:35:09,650
And one of you...

1393
01:35:09,734 --> 01:35:12,150
You are Mike, is that right?

1394
01:35:12,234 --> 01:35:14,169
Well played, Mike.

1395
01:35:14,253 --> 01:35:18,066
A bit naughty for a government contractor,
but we are where we are.

1396
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,317
Moving on.

1397
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:25,067
Two more ahead.
I'll take one o'clock.

1398
01:35:29,859 --> 01:35:33,317
The purpose of this visit is...
Danny?

1399
01:35:37,234 --> 01:35:40,192
You never paid Mr. Simmonds' commission.

1400
01:35:40,275 --> 01:35:44,234
We were paying for you
to deliver but you didn't.

1401
01:35:44,317 --> 01:35:48,275
- Mike did. You failed.
- That's a bit weak, isn't it, Trent?

1402
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:49,930
Because I wasn't paid to deliver

1403
01:35:50,014 --> 01:35:53,150
I was paid to supply and I think
I have supplied, have I, Danny?

1404
01:35:53,234 --> 01:35:56,775
<i>- Orson, take a left through the hedges.</i>
- Two on the J.

1405
01:35:59,818 --> 01:36:01,484
Now you're clear.

1406
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,353
Do we really have to listen to this?

1407
01:36:09,437 --> 01:36:12,150
You will listen to this,
and here's the reason.

1408
01:36:12,234 --> 01:36:16,025
I don't wanna patronize you.
I'm not a patronizing person.

1409
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:21,317
But you three, one, two, three,
you are quite new to this game, aren't you?

1410
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:25,192
And there' is a reason
why no one, and I do mean no one

1411
01:36:25,275 --> 01:36:29,442
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Gaddafi, not Mr. Escobar...

1412
01:36:29,526 --> 01:36:32,942
and that's before I start dropping names,

1413
01:36:33,025 --> 01:36:35,692
why none of them
have ever refused to pay me.

1414
01:36:35,776 --> 01:36:37,776
<i>- Have you got me?</i>
- Going dark.

1415
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:41,518
- Repositioning, let me find you.
- In the Can-Am.

1416
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:46,650
Behind me on a horizon, I think
you'll see an old derelict 1960s hotel.

1417
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:47,944
Needs demolition.

1418
01:36:48,028 --> 01:36:52,367
Now you could do that with, I don't know,
what, 30-40 pounds of Semtex,

1419
01:36:52,451 --> 01:36:54,845
is that about right, Mike?

1420
01:36:56,192 --> 01:37:01,067
Silence and darkness retained.
And you've got two more guards up top.

1421
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:05,109
Or you could do it with,
lights please, Danny.

1422
01:37:05,192 --> 01:37:09,234
One AGM-65 Maverick missile.

1423
01:37:09,317 --> 01:37:13,651
Very much like this one,
in three, two, one...

1424
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:19,859
What happened there then?

1425
01:37:19,942 --> 01:37:25,275
Let's do that again.
In three, two, one...

1426
01:37:29,025 --> 01:37:32,442
Wait, wait... There's more.

1427
01:37:46,567 --> 01:37:48,317
Here we are. I think we're done now.

1428
01:37:49,818 --> 01:37:52,651
Danny, the lights again, please.

1429
01:37:54,442 --> 01:37:59,150
What are you trying to convey
with this illustration, Mr. Simmonds?

1430
01:37:59,234 --> 01:38:04,025
What I'm trying to convey, Mike,
is how little you boys understand

1431
01:38:04,109 --> 01:38:07,818
of the new world
which you find yourselves in.

1432
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:11,076
I would've thought it was obvious
that I'd have some kind of insurance.

1433
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,009
And I do. Danny, give them the papers.

1434
01:38:17,275 --> 01:38:19,567
You'll see in the left hand column

1435
01:38:19,651 --> 01:38:22,294
there's a list of names
and addresses of people

1436
01:38:22,378 --> 01:38:24,525
that I believe you hold near and dear.

1437
01:38:24,609 --> 01:38:26,900
<i>Take the service elevator, one level down.</i>

1438
01:38:26,983 --> 01:38:29,359
And he's in. Phase two. Let's move.

1439
01:38:29,442 --> 01:38:32,752
In the right hand column
there's a very exact time

1440
01:38:32,836 --> 01:38:35,567
for when those people will be...

1441
01:38:35,651 --> 01:38:39,692
- What's the nice word for it, Danny?
- Uh... eviscerated.

1442
01:38:39,776 --> 01:38:42,167
That's not very nice word, is it?

1443
01:38:42,251 --> 01:38:44,108
But it's not gonna happen

1444
01:38:44,192 --> 01:38:48,359
because I'm very confident
that within five minutes...

1445
01:38:48,442 --> 01:38:52,234
And five minutes is all you have
as the countdown has started.

1446
01:38:52,317 --> 01:38:55,109
And the only thing that will stop it...

1447
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:03,025
is a phone call
from my business manager...

1448
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:10,983
telling me that my money
has been transferred to my account.

1449
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:24,109
<i>So from this point it's out of my hands
and into yours.</i>

1450
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:27,567
Danny, let's go and have a drink. Come on.

1451
01:39:30,192 --> 01:39:32,234
Bye, boys.

1452
01:39:34,597 --> 01:39:40,818
- I'm giving him the money.
- Mike, that's my mom, there! Jean!

1453
01:39:43,401 --> 01:39:45,797
That's the most impressive thing
I've seen a man do.

1454
01:39:45,881 --> 01:39:48,108
Really? Really?

1455
01:39:48,192 --> 01:39:49,910
Get the transfer done now!

1456
01:39:49,994 --> 01:39:52,514
- We were set up to make a payment anyway.
- So get it done now!

1457
01:39:59,567 --> 01:40:01,086
He's bluffing.

1458
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:03,567
Those explosions
didn't look like a bluff to me.

1459
01:40:03,651 --> 01:40:06,983
Turns out there's a reason they call him
the dark angel of merciless death, Mike.

1460
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:22,818
<i>Listen to me. He's bluffing.</i>

1461
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,609
Easy for you to say.
Do you even have anyone on your list?

1462
01:40:25,692 --> 01:40:28,818
You can forget your commission, Mike.
It's going to Simmonds.

1463
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:32,275
You're a useless pair of silicon tits.
Let me handle this.

1464
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:33,947
Back off!

1465
01:40:34,031 --> 01:40:36,025
You handling it put us in this mess.

1466
01:40:36,109 --> 01:40:38,883
I'm not interested
in what you have to say, Mike!

1467
01:40:38,967 --> 01:40:41,190
Now back the fuck off!

1468
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:52,484
Backing off.

1469
01:40:53,484 --> 01:40:55,025
Backing off.

1470
01:40:56,401 --> 01:40:58,983
Everybody, calm down. Calm down.

1471
01:40:59,067 --> 01:41:00,704
Mike looks upset.

1472
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:04,358
- Orson, how are you doing?
- Still alive, still moving upwards.

1473
01:41:04,442 --> 01:41:07,734
Greg left with a movie star, seems like
things are getting a bit heated in there.

1474
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:12,234
- Chris, progress report.
- It's happening. 30 seconds.

1475
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:15,021
They are doing the transferring now.

1476
01:41:15,105 --> 01:41:16,959
That's a billion dollars
to your Orphans of war.

1477
01:41:16,983 --> 01:41:19,107
- We'll be okay.
- We won't be okay.

1478
01:41:19,191 --> 01:41:21,525
Did you see what happened out there?
You think that's okay?

1479
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:26,112
I am in their system.
I have all their content details.

1480
01:41:26,196 --> 01:41:27,875
I can move all their money.

1481
01:41:27,976 --> 01:41:32,685
Truth is I am better than them
and you don't need them anymore.

1482
01:41:32,776 --> 01:41:35,554
It was your fucking idea to get involved
with a fucking weapons dealer.

1483
01:41:35,578 --> 01:41:37,775
We have a problem
and we have to deal with it.

1484
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:42,234
There were explosions going off
on the fucking horizon--

1485
01:41:58,442 --> 01:42:03,609
- Is it safe to go in?
- Hard to tell, but there is nobody moving.

1486
01:42:19,942 --> 01:42:22,442
Bit of a mess in here, whizz-kid.

1487
01:42:28,067 --> 01:42:30,275
I found the case, JJ.

1488
01:42:33,818 --> 01:42:36,442
Just checking.

1489
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,776
Looks good, boss.

1490
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:44,567
<i>Orson, behind you.
In three, two, one...</i>

1491
01:42:54,776 --> 01:42:56,401
Don't do it, Mike.

1492
01:42:56,484 --> 01:42:59,442
Leave it where it lies.

1493
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:08,858
Orson, I need the case.
I need the fucking case!

1494
01:43:08,942 --> 01:43:13,192
If you want it so bad, Mike,
you can fucking have it.

1495
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:39,651
- What's you got in the case?
- Our wages.

1496
01:43:39,734 --> 01:43:41,893
Is that Nathan with his army
to get us out of here?

1497
01:43:41,977 --> 01:43:43,941
That's not Nathan you can hear.

1498
01:43:44,025 --> 01:43:48,359
That's Knighton's black ops incoming,
a little bit late as usual.

1499
01:43:48,442 --> 01:43:49,616
Nathan abandoned us.

1500
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,688
Apparently he has something
more important to do.

1501
01:43:51,772 --> 01:43:52,816
Of course he did.

1502
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,542
He sent the BPJ.

1503
01:43:54,626 --> 01:43:57,575
He's in Doha.
Apparently there's been another incident.

1504
01:43:57,659 --> 01:43:59,769
But he told me to tell you not to panic,

1505
01:43:59,853 --> 01:44:02,317
he has all of your medicinal
requirements on board.

1506
01:44:02,401 --> 01:44:06,567
- Did you bring a corkscrew?
- I'll be your corkscrew, baby.

1507
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:10,169
Of course you will.
Bludge up, we're going on a holiday.

1508
01:44:43,484 --> 01:44:46,776
I suppose you all feeling
quite pleased with yourselves?

1509
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:50,609
It's impossible to feel pleased
with ourselves on the wages that you pay.

1510
01:44:50,692 --> 01:44:52,271
I have some good news.

1511
01:44:52,355 --> 01:44:55,243
Since your last escapade
was such a success...

1512
01:44:55,327 --> 01:44:56,734
Don't let it go to your heads.

1513
01:44:56,818 --> 01:45:01,692
I have another job for you.
And this time the money is spectacular.

1514
01:45:01,776 --> 01:45:05,677
I don't care how spectacular it is,
I'm going on a holiday.

1515
01:45:05,797 --> 01:45:08,150
- That's yours.
- Where are we going, darling?

1516
01:45:08,234 --> 01:45:10,399
Don't know, and I don't care.

1517
01:45:10,483 --> 01:45:13,358
As long as it's hot,
expensive and he's paying.

1518
01:45:13,442 --> 01:45:17,567
- We're taking the jet.
- Take it. Go wherever you want. Go mad.

1519
01:45:17,651 --> 01:45:20,040
Enjoy the snow, enjoy the beaches.
It's all on me.

1520
01:45:20,124 --> 01:45:22,233
As long as you're back in 36 hours.

1521
01:45:22,317 --> 01:45:25,317
- Two weeks.
- Orson!

1522
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:27,944
I'm not great at skiing.
I like the beach.

1523
01:45:28,051 --> 01:45:29,983
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm drunk.

1524
01:45:30,067 --> 01:45:32,401
- Fine, 48 hours!
- Ten days.

1525
01:45:32,484 --> 01:45:35,484
- You're killing me! 96 hours!
- A week.

1526
01:45:35,567 --> 01:45:39,983
And Orson, we need the necklaces and
watches you stole from the Ukrainians.

1527
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:42,526
Their government wants them back.

1528
01:45:42,609 --> 01:45:45,765
Too late. I've sold them.
I've invested the money.

1529
01:45:45,849 --> 01:45:47,832
We are now in a movie business.

1530
01:45:49,442 --> 01:45:51,651
See you next Tuesday.

1531
01:45:51,734 --> 01:45:55,234
Hold on... Orson!

1532
01:45:55,317 --> 01:45:57,442
Wait, what movie business?

1533
01:45:57,526 --> 01:46:02,567
It better not involve Danny Francesco
and his fiance Greg Simmonds.

1534
01:46:30,109 --> 01:46:35,818
You were paying to deliver,
but you didn't. Mike did. You failed.

1535
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:38,289
Yeah, it's a bit naughty, Mr. Yamamoto.

1536
01:46:38,373 --> 01:46:41,093
I'm not paid to deliver,
I'm paid to supply.

1537
01:46:43,192 --> 01:46:47,484
Now, there's a very good reason
why no one, and I mean no one.

1538
01:46:47,567 --> 01:46:50,942
Not Mr. Hussein, not Mr. Gadaffi,
not Mr. Escobar...

1539
01:46:51,025 --> 01:46:53,192
And that's before I start dropping names.

1540
01:46:53,275 --> 01:46:58,058
Behind me on a horizon
there's a derelict monastery,

1541
01:46:58,142 --> 01:47:00,567
in need of demolition.

1542
01:47:00,651 --> 01:47:02,317
How are we going to do that?

1543
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:08,609
We could use 50-60 pounds of Semtex,
does that sound about right, Mr. Yamamoto?

1544
01:47:08,692 --> 01:47:15,109
Or we could use one
single AMG-65 Maverick missile.

1545
01:47:15,192 --> 01:47:17,572
Very much like this.

1546
01:47:17,656 --> 01:47:20,859
Going in three, two, one...

1547
01:47:23,975 --> 01:47:28,226
Fucking amateur.
Maxie, where is the VFX, Maxie?

1548
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:30,918
- Come on, man, I can't work like this.
- Sorry, I'll get it fixed.

1549
01:47:30,942 --> 01:47:34,609
- Barney, can you get me Guy?
- Cut the camera. Reset everybody.

1550
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:39,651
What do you think of that one, Greggy?

1551
01:47:39,734 --> 01:47:44,900
I'll be honest with you.
For me it was very very moving.

1552
01:47:44,983 --> 01:47:47,150
That was beautiful, Danny.

1553
01:47:47,234 --> 01:47:50,734
- That one?
- That one.

1554
01:47:50,818 --> 01:47:53,356
I don't know, that was not my best take.

1555
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,483
Did you like that one?

1556
01:47:55,567 --> 01:47:59,442
I love that take because you're smiley
but you're scary too.

1557
01:47:59,526 --> 01:48:04,776
Yeah, but look at my hair, it's off.
It just feels like it's off.

1558
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:08,567
- There. And there. Brilliant.
- I think we can do another one.

1559
01:48:08,651 --> 01:48:10,697
- Go on then. Off you go.
- Guys!

1560
01:48:10,781 --> 01:48:14,983
