1
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:40,082
<i>Nathan.</i>

2
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,116
<i>How are you, old man?</i>

3
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,216
<i>Very good.</i>
<i>Thank you, Mr. Knighton.</i>

4
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:47,149
You look like
the walking dead.

5
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,717
Yes. Well, I'm always
a little bit cold

6
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,383
when I've
just got out of bed.

7
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,316
Perhaps you can tell me
why I've been summoned,

8
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,484
8:00 a.m.
on a Sunday morning?

9
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:56,817
Well, if you'd care to
study the film, you'll see
that two nights ago,

10
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:01,216
some heavily guarded cargo
was ambushed outside
a facility in Johannesburg,

11
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,216
<i>where 20 security guards</i>
<i>were mercilessly annihilated.</i>

12
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:08,116
<i>I want you to retrieve</i>
<i>what went missing</i>

13
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,283
<i>and to find out</i>
<i>who the seller is,</i>

14
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:11,517
<i>who the buyer is,</i>

15
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,484
and what it is.

16
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:16,651
So we don't know exactly
what it is, sir?

17
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:20,417
<i>No. That is the mystery.</i>

18
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,651
But our analysts
in intelligence reported

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,116
it very quickly
became extremely popular
with the wrong sort of people.

20
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:28,383
<i>And with a price tag</i>
<i>of around ten billion,</i>

21
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:31,717
I don't think we can afford
for it to remain a mystery
much longer.

22
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:37,417
It's been given the name
"the Handle."

23
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,450
But why me?
Why not the official
intelligence branch?

24
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:43,283
<i>Ruse de guerre,</i> Nathan.

25
00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:45,784
An unorthodox approach to war.

26
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,784
I need a creative, cunning
and unconventional vision

27
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:51,851
to retrieve
this kind of mercurial threat.

28
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:55,116
A courier on a bicycle
in congested traffic,

29
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:56,717
not the official team.

30
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:58,817
They'd take forever to wade
through the administration,

31
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:00,551
and the clock doth ticketh.

32
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,349
So, who will be
heading up your team?

33
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,651
Oh, the usual chap.
Orson Fortune.

34
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,717
Oh, fuck.

35
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,216
That man is
an administrative nightmare.

36
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,450
He can't fly
unless there's a private jet
because of claustrophobia.

37
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:17,484
Then he needs sedating
with the finest claret
because of agoraphobia.

38
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:20,082
And then there's
the rehabilitation
in the Maldives

39
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,116
because
of cloudo-bloody-phobia.

40
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:24,484
Yes, I understand, sir.

41
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:26,484
But when you cut back
on his expenses

42
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:29,484
and created
a mental health department,
it was a perfect storm.

43
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,850
He's trained to exploit
every system presented,

44
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:36,684
which is why he is
the very bicycle courier
you require.

45
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,283
Where is he?

46
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:39,817
<i>Well, it's funny</i>
<i>you should say that, sir.</i>

47
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>He is on one of his, uh,</i>
<i>rehabilitation retreats.</i>

48
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:46,316
<i>Yes, you are paying for that,</i>
<i>sir, but don't worry.</i>

49
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,316
I think I can pull him in.

50
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,751
The fuck are you
doing here, Nathan?

51
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:51,751
Everything all right,
Orson?
No, it's not.

52
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:54,149
I'm supposed to be
on holiday,

53
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:57,350
and you're supposed to be
4,000 miles in that direction.

54
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:02,182
Actually, it's 3,000 miles
in that direction.
But whatever.

55
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:04,317
-Mind if I come in?
-Yes, I fucking do.

56
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:06,850
Aren't you gonna ask
why I'm here?

57
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:09,317
No, I'm fucking not,
because you're not staying.

58
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,551
Wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.

59
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,617
I don't care
how fucking serious it is.

60
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,249
I'm on holiday,
and I'm not interested
in working at the moment.

61
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:20,517
There's a price to pay
for possessing
a unique set of skills,

62
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,717
being as brilliant
as you are,

63
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,783
and please don't take this
the wrong way,

64
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:30,651
as a private contractor,
your government pays you
handsomely for.

65
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:33,384
I'm ignoring this apparition.
I'm talking to an empty space.

66
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,651
You're going home.

67
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,384
And I'm gonna
meet my girlfriend...

68
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,783
at the bar.

69
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:41,816
Ah, yes. About
that girlfriend of yours.

70
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,384
It seems as though she's not
just your girlfriend.

71
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,617
But don't worry,
we'll fly her home first class.

72
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,517
Have you been
spying on me, Nathan?
I am sorry.

73
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:54,216
But something rather nasty
has been stolen.

74
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,049
How nasty?

75
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,350
Under file A is file B.

76
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,816
That's the list
of nefarious potential buyers

77
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,384
whose interests
have been aroused.

78
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,116
We don't know
what was stolen.

79
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,149
That remains a mystery
for you to solve.

80
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:09,216
But we need to stop it
getting onto the open market.

81
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:11,484
Threat's imminent.

82
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:14,182
How imminent?
Imminently imminent.

83
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:17,551
Put it this way.
When you hit the ground,
you'll be running, literally.

84
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,116
We've got the plane.

85
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,182
The BBJ, this year's model.

86
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,450
And all your medicinal
requirements.

87
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:26,149
'82, '96, 2004.

88
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:29,417
Marinate.

89
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,182
And I'll see you
in two minutes.

90
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:34,116
<i>Fine. So Orson</i>
<i>will be heading your team.</i>

91
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,617
Will you be using John,
the comms man?

92
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:39,217
- Ah, sadly not, sir.
- Isn't he the best?

93
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,850
Well, he might be good...

94
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,116
...but he turned out
to be something of
a duplicitous snake.

95
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:47,217
He went over
to Mike Hook's team.

96
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,082
Ah, Mike, the competition.

97
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,450
Yes. Just on that note, sir,
I do hope we won't be competing

98
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,584
for the same prize
on this mission with Mike.

99
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,450
There is more than one
security department
in this government.

100
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:58,384
Mike is on another job.

101
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,783
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

102
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:02,551
-Afternoon, Lucinda.
-Sir.

103
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,683
Oh, I was starting to worry.

104
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:08,116
Had to get changed.
Didn't we all?

105
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:10,250
-Captain, can we
warm the engines up?
-Right away, sir.

106
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:11,384
Isn't that the '82?

107
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:12,783
It's still drinking well.

108
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,683
Isn't this
my medicinal requirement?

109
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,116
Yes.

110
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:19,384
Thirsty, were ya?

111
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,082
Party for one,
like all your parties?

112
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,317
Is it the usual team?

113
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,816
Minus John.
Where's John?

114
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,584
-John got poached.
-By who?

115
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:33,450
By "whom." Never mind.

116
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:35,284
But I do mind. I know John.

117
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,651
I like John.
I trust John. He's a pro.

118
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:39,417
Someone paying him more?
Yes.

119
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,484
If I asked,
would you pay me more?

120
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:43,783
-You can ask.
-Will you pay me more?

121
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,417
No.

122
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,384
You're above
that grubby self-interest.

123
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,217
You're a patriot.

124
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,183
And besides,
no one gets treated
like you get treated.

125
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:54,716
When you say "you,"
you really mean you.

126
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,450
Anyway, who's my footman?

127
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,250
I found
a splendid replacement.

128
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,317
-What's his name?
-Sarah Fidel.

129
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:03,250
Strong nom de guerre.

130
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:05,617
-Never heard of him.
-That's because
she's an American.

131
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,116
"She."

132
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,616
Lucinda, bring
the 2004 Haut-Brion, please.

133
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,551
Ah.

134
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,250
I'll help myself to a beer.

135
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:24,650
<i>I have a rather</i>
<i>fabulous replacement</i>
<i>for Comms John.</i>

136
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:28,750
An American, much more
versatile and creative.
Sarah Fidel.

137
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,584
Didn't she work with Mike?

138
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:35,117
Mike, consistent
with his character,
abandoned her in Beirut,

139
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,484
which is where
I picked her up.

140
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:37,850
Any other footmen?

141
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:40,716
Yes, this young man,
JJ Davies.

142
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,816
There really isn't very much
he can't do either.

143
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,650
Comms, guns, driving,
diving, rapping, slapping,
you name it.

144
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:51,317
They are both
two comprehensive footmen,
the perfect all-rounders.

145
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:03,750
Isn't that JJ?
What's he doing here?

146
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,517
He's joined the team.

147
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,183
He's a good kid,
but isn't he a bit green?

148
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:10,783
He's been very busy
since you last saw him.

149
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:15,183
He's what you might call
enthusiastic, hungry, keen.

150
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,117
Don't put your fingers
near his mouth.

151
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,417
-JJ.
-Sir.

152
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,517
Mr. Fortune, meet Miss Fidel.

153
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,583
Miss Fidel.

154
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,183
Your Highness.

155
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,716
Apparently,
you're the new John.

156
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,750
Not meaning a toilet
or prostitute's client,
I take it?

157
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:38,583
Please don't pee on me.
I don't do that anymore.

158
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,716
John didn't have
a personality.

159
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,550
I liked John.

160
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,150
You can call her "John"
if it makes you
more comfortable.

161
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:50,350
He was reliable.

162
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,217
Wasn't that reliable.

163
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,516
Heard he got poached
by my old team.
Your old team?

164
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,117
The other leading
private contractor
favored by your government.

165
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:02,484
You worked for Mike?

166
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,083
Mike, the competition Mike?

167
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:07,650
You may not like Mike,
but Mike is good.

168
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,284
What we got?

169
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,683
Bagman, coming in
on a flight with a hard drive.

170
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:14,716
We need to track him,
see where he takes it.

171
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,516
I'm gonna
keep an eye on you,

172
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,750
feed you
constructive information,
play the right music.

173
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:21,716
I'll control the turntables,
you control the dance floor.

174
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,284
Like to dance?

175
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,850
I liked John.

176
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:28,317
We'll send him
some flowers
on your behalf.

177
00:09:40,683 --> 00:09:42,550
Got anything yet?

178
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,850
Okay, I'm getting somewhere
very slowly.

179
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,117
Still dialing in.
Can you hear it?

180
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,317
Do you actually know
how to use a computer?

181
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,483
Well, I'm sure I can find
my way if you just tell me
where the on button is.

182
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:59,384
Nathan,
we've been here three hours,
and my feet are hurting.

183
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,384
<i>She's your responsibility.</i>
<i>She slips up, it's on you.</i>

184
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,150
I hired her. I trust her.

185
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,850
We have a three-hour window,
okay?

186
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:07,449
He's gotta be with us soon.

187
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,583
In fact, on cue.

188
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,850
-Think I got him.
-About time.

189
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:16,317
<i>Hiding in that crocodile</i>
<i>should be the drive.</i>

190
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,550
<i>What's on the drive?</i>
<i>We don't know.</i>

191
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,716
<i>Orson,</i>
<i>just remember he's a bagman.</i>

192
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,516
<i>A retired professor,</i>
<i>not a threat</i>
<i>or a black belt in Mogadishu.</i>

193
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,483
<i>I'll try not to</i>
<i>frighten him to death.</i>

194
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,683
<i>We just need to know</i>
<i>who he's delivering it to.</i>

195
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,850
<i>Whiz kid,</i>
<i>what am I looking for?</i>

196
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,716
Brown hat, spectacles,
crocodile-skin briefcase,
upper level.

197
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,616
<i>He should be coming</i>
<i>into your peepers now.</i>

198
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,083
<i>I'm in his phone,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna send him</i>
<i>a message.</i>

199
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,384
<i>"Car is delayed."</i>

200
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,783
<i>You see him, sweetheart?</i>
Got him.

201
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,449
<i>Sending him</i>
<i>to Luigi's Coffee Bar,</i>

202
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,516
<i>ground floor.</i>

203
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,850
How do you know it's him?

204
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:47,616
You dance, I'll play,
remember?

205
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,317
Jane, he's heading your way.

206
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,683
In position.

207
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,516
JJ, take the B stairs.

208
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,083
He passing me now,
heading to coffee shop.

209
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,284
<i>He's all yours.</i>

210
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,716
I still see you in position.
Jane, respond.

211
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,850
Jane?

212
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,416
Wakey-wakey, whiz kid.

213
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,416
Orson, I'm getting
no response from Jane.

214
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:18,516
JJ, keep your peepers peeled
and your hands
out of your pockets.

215
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,183
Peepers peeled.
Hands flying free.

216
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:23,516
Marcia, the job is yours.
Catch him at the counter.

217
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,516
<i>Confirm when</i>
<i>the tracker's in place.</i>

218
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,816
Moving in now.

219
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,716
Why do I smell
something ratty?

220
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,217
I smell it too.

221
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,083
Marcia,
confirm tracker in place.

222
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,716
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

223
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,583
<i>Confirm tracker in place.</i>

224
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,217
Why do I get the feeling
we're not the only team
in town?

225
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,183
<i>Can't be. I would know.</i>

226
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:49,750
Okay, that's odd.

227
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,317
Either it's a glitch
in the network or someone's--

228
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:54,083
someone is very good.

229
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:56,117
In my experience,
it's seldom the network.

230
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,516
<i>Who could do that?</i>

231
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,284
John.

232
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:02,516
John could do that.

233
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,117
Smells like Team B.

234
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,083
Nathan, what the fuck
are they doing here?

235
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:09,550
If that weasel John is here,
it means that toad Mike
is too.

236
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,851
Stand by.

237
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:13,550
Nathan.

238
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,217
<i>Mike isn't</i>
<i>on a different job, is he, sir?</i>

239
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,284
Or is it a coincidence
that his team
is at Madrid Airport?

240
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:22,683
If he's there, it isn't
because of my department.

241
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,783
My world works
in a similar fashion to yours.

242
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:27,416
The government likes to keep
departments competing.

243
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,550
Competition
for the best condition.

244
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,316
Mike only has two talents.

245
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,449
Blowing his cover
and blowing himself.

246
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:35,183
But thanks for the heads-up.

247
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,284
Orson, confirmed.

248
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:39,117
<i>Mike is here</i>
<i>to track the crocodile.</i>

249
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,083
Mike's clumsy and predictable.

250
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:42,851
They're not here to track him.
They're here to pick him up.

251
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,416
I've resolved the glitch.
We're going back live.

252
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,383
<i>JJ, change of policy.</i>

253
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,716
Don't go in, go out.
Exit door F pincer.

254
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,217
On it, boss.

255
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:56,550
You have two inbound,
8:00 and six o'clock.

256
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,750
Understood.

257
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:02,316
Just tell me they haven't
tasered the girls.

258
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:04,851
Uh... Oh, yes, tasered.

259
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,683
Let me feel your rhythm,
whiz kid.

260
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,516
- Count me in.
<i>- Three, two, one.</i>

261
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,083
Take a deep breath.
That's right.

262
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,751
<i>Our man is en route to exit.</i>

263
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,751
<i>Main gate departures.</i>
<i>Two B's in pursuit.</i>

264
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:38,316
<i>I'm on it. I'm exiting</i>
<i>through the parallel doors.</i>

265
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,349
<i>He's moving to taxi 49502.</i>

266
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,117
-Nathan, you're needed.
-Incoming.

267
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,516
<i>JJ, your location?</i>

268
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,117
<i>Exiting through</i>
<i>east parallel doors.</i>

269
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,117
<i>-Señor? Hola, señor.</i>
-Mr. Bakker.

270
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,717
Oh, no, no, no.
I cannot come with you.

271
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,483
<i>Two more B's</i>
<i>posing in the car.</i>

272
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,117
- No, no, please.
- Come with us.

273
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,050
What's going on?

274
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:10,683
Heart. Heart. Heart.

275
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,383
JJ, wheel.

276
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,083
Heart.

277
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,050
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't know.

278
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:20,083
-Keeps saying he's hot.
-No, no. Heart.

279
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:22,150
Loosen his tie.

280
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,616
He doesn't feel very hot.

281
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,150
He's not hot, you idiots.

282
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,349
He has a heart condition.

283
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,182
We have two of them
in pursuit.

284
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:35,117
<i>The drive will be encrypted,</i>
<i>but I can clone it remotely.</i>

285
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,616
Connect me to the hard drive.

286
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,717
We're roadblocked.

287
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,083
They have my wife.
They will kill her.

288
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,817
JJ, lock the doors.

289
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,483
There's a dozen of them,
fully armed.

290
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,449
Get out!
Get out of the vehicle, now!

291
00:14:58,483 --> 00:14:59,717
<i>I need more time.</i>

292
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,383
I need another 20 seconds.

293
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:05,316
They don't know me, my face.

294
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:10,316
You go to the Duchess.
Table 12, 6:00 p.m.!
Save my wife!

295
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,182
Four.

296
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,449
<i>Three... two...</i>

297
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,083
Open the door!

298
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:29,751
<i>I've got it. Let it go.</i>

299
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:42,651
We're gonna need a shovel.

300
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:46,050
-Nathan.
-Mike.

301
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,751
Nice of you to knock.

302
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,116
-Orson.
-Mike.

303
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,149
That belong to me?

304
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,684
What'd he do
to our friend here?

305
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,784
You scared him to death, Mike.

306
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,249
It's good, sir.

307
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,449
Second mouse
always gets the cheese, mmm?

308
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,751
Yeah. Let's go.

309
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:22,116
<i>The drive is good,</i>
<i>but it's scrambled.</i>

310
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,483
<i>Without the data key,</i>
<i>it's useless.</i>

311
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,684
<i>So our best option,</i>
<i>deliver the drive</i>

312
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:27,449
<i>and find out who the buyer is.</i>

313
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:40,483
<i>No one interesting</i>
<i>has joined the rooftop</i>
<i>in the last 40 minutes.</i>

314
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:43,817
So whoever
you're there to meet
is already there.

315
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:50,283
Here we go. Nathan,
your file says you're terrible
at accents. So don't talk.

316
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:52,449
Bakker?

317
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,116
This for me?

318
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:05,717
Have a good evening.

319
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,149
Think I got him.

320
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,416
He's coming back
as Ben Harris.

321
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,684
Ben Harris.

322
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:18,116
He's the lawyer/consigliere
to Greg Simmonds.

323
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:19,383
Who's Greg Simmonds?

324
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,116
He's a billionaire
arms dealer.

325
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:23,383
-Only plays in the top tier.
-Greg Simmonds.

326
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,617
Interested in selling 9-mils
to kids. He's selling
Tomahawks to terrorists.

327
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,283
He's impossible to catch.
Very elusive.

328
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,449
He only uses Ben Harris
on his biggest deals.

329
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,717
And if he's turned up in person,
speaks for itself.

330
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,182
Oh, hello.
This might be useful.

331
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,416
Greg's hosting a charity event
in Cannes.

332
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:43,149
Well,
that's convenient, 'cause
we're also going to Cannes.

333
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:44,584
Seems he loves an orphan.

334
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:46,484
Well, he wants to.
He made enough of them.

335
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,349
Uh, we've picked up some time.
So we'll be arriving into LA
in less than four hours.

336
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:57,584
LA?

337
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:07,216
When I put my head down,
we were heading to
the south of France.

338
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:11,383
So, can someone please tell me
why we're flying to Los Angeles?

339
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,717
The power of "no," Nathan.

340
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,784
I'm sorry?

341
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,383
Backwards to go forwards.

342
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,584
We're going to LA
to pick up our invitation.

343
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:19,817
That being?

344
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:21,383
Danny Francesco.

345
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,851
Danny Francesco?
The movie star?

346
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:32,283
- Goddamn it!
- Stunt failed. Reset.

347
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:35,216
I do the stunts,
you shoot the money.

348
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,551
Wake up, everybody!

349
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,283
Chad, get out
of the fucking car!

350
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:44,551
Greg Simmonds's
favorite movie star,
Danny Francesco.

351
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,450
And how does that get us in?

352
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:49,249
You can't catch this fish
with conventional lures.

353
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:52,283
Greg wants
what everyone wants.
What they can't have.

354
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:55,283
There's nothing he can't buy
apart from Danny Francesco,

355
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:58,316
who recently snubbed
a ten-million-dollar offer

356
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,751
to jump out of a cake
and sing him "Happy Birthday."

357
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:04,651
He's obsessed
with celebrities, but more
obsessed with their partners.

358
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,851
Sarah will be going
as Danny's girlfriend.

359
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:11,283
It's the fish
that can't be caught, Nathan.
Power of "no."

360
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,450
And how do we turn
this movie star's "no"
into a "yes"?

361
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:17,116
I think we've got something.

362
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,049
Blackmail?

363
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:21,182
Yeah, blackmail.

364
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,817
Hmm. <i>Ruse de guerre.</i>

365
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,717
Very good. Carry on.

366
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,283
So, how are you
gonna play this?

367
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,751
I found
some spectacular dirt

368
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,784
on the infamous movie producer
Saul Goldstein,

369
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,517
so I pulled him in to help us.

370
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,316
I asked Saul to lure Danny
to Vegas

371
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,316
under the premise
of a five-picture deal.

372
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,417
But as Greg is hosting
his charity fundraising event

373
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,349
that we would like to attend,

374
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:42,551
you're going to ask
Danny Francesco
to come with us instead.

375
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:45,149
Huh. Creative work.

376
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,182
So what have we got
on Danny Francesco?

377
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,450
He's having an affair
with his sister-in-law.

378
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,617
Told you she was good.

379
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:55,851
Leave this with me.

380
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:58,417
Fucking Jesus.

381
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,049
Fucking Swedish.

382
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,417
You kill me, Saul!

383
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,784
Oh, Saul.
You're a fabulous producer.

384
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:08,484
I mean,
you're a piece of shit, but
you're a fabulous producer.

385
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:10,484
Everybody wants to
work with you.
I want to work with you.

386
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:12,817
But a Swedish accent, Saul?

387
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,517
Come on, I'm an American!

388
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:17,617
I can't do an accent.
Hello, Natasha.

389
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,384
Danny's not gonna
need you on this flight.

390
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,484
Uh, really?
Yeah. One of those things.

391
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:27,182
I appreciate that, Danny,
but we need you
to do this for us.

392
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:29,417
"For us"?

393
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,417
What, the royal "us"?
What are you talking about?

394
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:36,584
I mean, you have
to do this for us.

395
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:37,816
I have to?

396
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:42,450
I don't mean to
contradict you, Saul,

397
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:44,751
but I don't have to do
anything for anybody.

398
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:48,751
And I don't want to
contradict you, Danny,
but we all have to do our bit.

399
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,317
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,517
I thought you were here
to serve the coffee.

401
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:56,850
Why do I suddenly feel like
I'm being ganged up on here,
Saul?

402
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:59,350
-Who are you?
-I'm your new manager.

403
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,484
I'm sorry, kid.

404
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:05,149
They had something on me
too.

405
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:08,850
Okay, Saul,
where are you going? Saul--

406
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,484
I'm gonna let you converse
with your new manager.

407
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,284
You're gonna do great, Danny.
You're a star.

408
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:16,484
Saul. Hey, Saul.

409
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,551
-Where do you think
you're go-- This is--
-See you soon.

410
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,384
Saul,
don't you dare leave the--

411
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:21,717
Natasha!

412
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,417
Where is Natasha?

413
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,517
Who let this man
on my plane?

414
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:30,717
Natasha!

415
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:35,249
-This is my plane!
-Yes, it is, Danny,
and it's a lovely plane.

416
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:37,517
But you're gonna have to
trust me for two minutes.

417
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,783
-Why should I?
-Because you're an actor.
You're a movie star.

418
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,384
Because you're
a professional.

419
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:44,717
Imagine we're in a scene.

420
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,216
Please, sit down.

421
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,350
Are you a patriot?

422
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,450
I don't vote Republican,
if that's what you mean.

423
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:04,617
Okay. Let me give it to you
a different way.

424
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:08,783
The world needs you
for your greatest role yet.

425
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,484
You and I
are going to a party.

426
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:13,783
Who are you?

427
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:16,617
I'm your manager,
Charlie Rosewood.

428
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,750
You're no longer
going to Vegas.
We're going to Cannes.

429
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,284
No. You are getting off
of my plane,

430
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:24,716
and Natasha's
gonna make you.

431
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,384
Natasha! Natasha!

432
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,082
What the fuck
have you done with Natasha?

433
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,284
Please calm down.

434
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:36,217
There's a sensitive
and awkward situation between
you and your sister-in-law...

435
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:39,584
that you probably
shouldn't have filmed.

436
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:53,350
I actually love
my sister-in-law.

437
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,082
Yes, Danny. You've made that
quite evident.

438
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:05,484
It turns out everyone thinks
you're a superstar, Danny.

439
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,617
Once they heard
you were in town,
they came to us.

440
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,484
Uh--
Stop.

441
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,250
I don't think
I can do this.

442
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:14,551
No, no, no.
Danny.

443
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:15,617
Nope.
Danny.

444
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:16,816
Trust yourself.

445
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,417
No need to be nervous.

446
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,183
No reason to be nervous?
They're only killers.

447
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,082
We've all seen you
handle killers before
on-screen.

448
00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:26,683
Fundamentally,
there's no difference.

449
00:23:26,716 --> 00:23:28,584
What do you think
an agent does?

450
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,716
They act. And no one acts
better than you, Danny.

451
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:33,816
The best agents are stars,

452
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,650
and the best actors
are movie stars.

453
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,450
I guess that's sorta true.

454
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,816
You're an actor. Act.

455
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,417
There's a big difference
between an actor
and a movie star.

456
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,816
-And that is why
they're obsessed with you.
-Yeah.

457
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,217
Well, that and the fact that
I didn't jump out of a cake
for $10 million.

458
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:58,150
Okay.

459
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:00,650
While I'm busy playing
my part, what are you two
gonna be doing?

460
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:04,117
We need to get close enough
to Greg Simmonds
to remotely access his cell.

461
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,117
Okay.
I'm ready.

462
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,082
Let's go to work.

463
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,250
<i>Walking on set.</i>

464
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:48,484
Good.

465
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:51,250
Remember, you're not there
to buy anything.

466
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:55,217
I'm sure
I don't have to remind you

467
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,550
that you spent the entire
annual budget on wine
during the flight over.

468
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,450
<i>So lay off the wine,</i>
<i>concentrate on getting</i>
<i>into Greg's phone,</i>

469
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:05,683
<i>and identify who's actually</i>
<i>buying this Handle.</i>

470
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:08,484
Understood.
Danny, we good?

471
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:10,716
Good? Is that a joke?

472
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,517
Remember,
you're a professional.

473
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,250
You're playing yourself.

474
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:16,350
I-- But I've never
played myself.
You can do this.

475
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,117
Ladies and gentlemen...
Danny.

476
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,716
...lot number 4
from the Quintess Collection

477
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,683
is a pair of diamond
and sapphire earrings.

478
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:27,317
And a round of applause,
please, for Sir Jonathan Mendes

479
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,517
for the winning bid
of $258,000.

480
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,583
...happy ending because he--
he was diagnosed with, um--

481
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,850
What's that funny cancer?
Um...

482
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:37,816
Is there a funny cancer?

483
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,417
Can't remember what it was.
It was something
like cock cancer.

484
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,650
And he, uh-- He, uh...

485
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,616
-What?
-Will someone pinch me, please?

486
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,083
Pinch you? Why?
'Cause I think I'm dreaming.

487
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,716
Is that...

488
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,783
Is that Danny Francesco?

489
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:55,350
D'you know what?
I'm a little bit excited.

490
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,484
Oh, I do love
Danny Francesco.

491
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,384
Everyone loves
Danny Francesco.

492
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,484
I am a little bit starstruck.
I am. It's not cool, but I am.

493
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:05,117
Good evening.
Ah, good evening.

494
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,450
- Hi.
- Nah, I'll tell you what...

495
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,083
Danny, you like this--
Do you like this piece?

496
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:13,284
Love it.

497
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:15,250
<i>It's one thing</i>
<i>utilizing the expense account</i>

498
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,816
because you have
"psychological" issues.

499
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,850
It's another thing
bankrupting the department.

500
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:22,083
What's he doing here?

501
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,217
Was that you,
Benjamin Bunny?

502
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,850
Not guilty, Mr. Simmonds.

503
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:27,350
It was you, wasn't it?

504
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:28,616
It's a surprise, sir.

505
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,583
Ah, how much
is that fabulous item?

506
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:33,150
Lot number 15.

507
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:36,083
-$1.5 million.
-Ooh.

508
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:39,516
Lot number 15 from
the Habsburg collection.
You like it, Danny?

509
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,417
It's wonderful.
1.5 million, you say, eh?

510
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:45,250
Anything Danny buys,
he can pay for himself.
He can afford it.

511
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:47,117
He likes it.

512
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,650
Don't you fucking dare,
Orson.

513
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,449
-I'll take it.
<i>-Orson!</i>

514
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:54,284
Sadly, he can't.
It's no longer available.

515
00:26:54,317 --> 00:26:56,516
-Shame.
-It's not a terrible shame.

516
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,150
It now belongs to you.

517
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,117
Compliments of Mr. Simmonds.

518
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,483
He's a big fan.

519
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:04,117
Mr. Danny Francesco.

520
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,616
Look at you.

521
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,150
The one and only,
the legend.

522
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,117
You're very kind.
No, no. I'm Greg Simmonds.

523
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,217
And I wanna thank you
very much

524
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,284
for all the entertainment
you've provided us
over the years.

525
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,483
-Thank you.
-Well, listen.

526
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:20,250
It's a fantastic gesture,
but I can't accept it.

527
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:23,183
No, no, you can,
and you can for two reasons.

528
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:25,083
One, you deserve it.

529
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:27,250
Two, it's a fundraiser.

530
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:32,083
Speaking of which,
would you care to meet

531
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,317
Trent and Arnold,
who are both in biotech?

532
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,183
I don't wanna be vulgar,
but 22 billion, 17 billion.

533
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:43,250
Sorry, boys, I didn't wanna
be indiscreet, but, you know,
facts are facts.

534
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,250
And they're both sponsoring
tonight's event.

535
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:47,350
Hey.
Big fan.

536
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:49,317
Oh, thank you. Great cause.

537
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,050
We try, you know.

538
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,816
Orphans. War.

539
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,350
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, oh, oh.

540
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:01,183
Let me introduce to you
the...
...the lovely Michaela.

541
00:28:01,217 --> 00:28:02,683
Well, what
an absolute pleasure.

542
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:05,217
Pleasure's all mine.

543
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,350
And can I just say--
Are we allowed to
say these things now?

544
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:10,083
Wow. Wow.

545
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:11,483
- Wow.
- Wow.

546
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,217
Hello.
What's your name?

547
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,850
-Ah, Charlie Rosewood.
-Hello, Charlie.

548
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:18,250
My business manager,
Charlie Rosewood.

549
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:20,117
Oh, yeah? Are you sure?

550
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,583
You don't look like
a business manager.

551
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,083
Books, covers.

552
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:29,183
Oh, yeah.
Well, big book, aren't ya?

553
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:31,183
He's doubled my money
in the last three years.

554
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:33,516
Is that right?
You got any tips for me, then?

555
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,117
I don't think
you need any tips,
do you, Mr. Simmonds?

556
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,616
- You'd be surprised.
I'm very, very greedy.

557
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,284
Well, maybe tonight you'll be
loosening the purse strings
a bit for us.

558
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:45,250
Uh, no tax benefits,
so no chance.

559
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:47,383
And, uh,
Danny doesn't like kids.

560
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,250
Oh.

561
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,217
He was kidding.

562
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,750
Well, you're not wrong.

563
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:57,217
Actually, we've got two
of the war orphans
here tonight,

564
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,150
and they're really annoying.

565
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:01,349
I don't want to be pushy,
but there's a lot of

566
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:02,716
very interesting people
at this party,

567
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,683
and I would-- I'd--

568
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:07,449
Emilia, could you
take that for me, me darling?

569
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,217
I would love you
to meet some of them.

570
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,550
Well, I--

571
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,583
Mr. Simmonds,
I would love to.

572
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:15,383
I just--
I'm actually quite shy.

573
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:18,183
Danny,
it's the least you can do.

574
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:21,284
Mr. Simmonds here,
he just spent
1.5 million on you.

575
00:29:21,316 --> 00:29:24,750
Well-- No. To be accurate,
I didn't spend it on Danny.

576
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:26,683
I spent it on Michaela.

577
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:32,150
Suggestion: Why don't we all
retire to the cocktail master?

578
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:35,416
That's what
you usually call me,
right, honey?

579
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:36,550
Minus the "tail."

580
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:40,117
She's--

581
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,316
I don't think I believe
what I just heard.

582
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:43,616
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

583
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,383
Come on, over to the bar.

584
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,750
You are gonna
wash your mouth out.
Come on, Danny.

585
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:49,583
A generous donation of...

586
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,283
So I grab him
by the balls...
Yeah, yeah.

587
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:05,316
...and I say,
"If you speak to her
like that again,

588
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:08,083
I'm gonna rip off your head
and shit down your neck."

589
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:11,083
And I feel something.
I feel a little lump.
Yeah.

590
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:13,083
Two days later, he's diagnosed
with testicle cancer.

591
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:14,550
Oh, my God.

592
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,349
A year later,
he wins his first
Tour de France.

593
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,383
- I love that.
- Yeah?

594
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,817
He's funny, isn't he?
And he's naughty too.

595
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,550
Yeah.
Yes.

596
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,583
Go on, then.
Give us some more.

597
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,383
<i>-How are we gonna</i>
<i>get to his cell?</i>
-His guard still has it.

598
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,851
We've been watching her.
Go find her.

599
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,817
One for the footman then.

600
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:34,316
Really?
Why can't you do it?

601
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,516
You wanted to be
more than a whiz kid.

602
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,050
You wanna get in the field,
get your shoes dirty.

603
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:42,683
Go on, everyone,
have another cocktail.

604
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,550
Keep him busy.
He cost a fortune.
Didn't you, Jean-Pierre?

605
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,616
Look at that.
Look at that! It's magic!

606
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,616
That's it.
Do all the monkey business.
That's it. Flip, flip.

607
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,249
I'll get yours, Michaela,
while you go to the powder room.

608
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,851
Oh, thank you so much.

609
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,616
It's not so much magic.
Just a little practice.

610
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,650
I could do that.
Give me ten minutes...

611
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:58,784
While I powder my nose,
what will you be doing,
Mr. Charlie Rosewood?

612
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:03,216
The waiter behind you was also
at the Madrid Airport.

613
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:06,083
Nathan, Mike's back again.
<i>I heard.</i>

614
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:08,249
You deal with Greg.
I'll handle Mike.

615
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:12,316
You do your thing,
and, uh, I'll do mine.

616
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,583
Okay, sweetheart.

617
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:16,516
Go on, then.
Give us some more.

618
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,516
Go back to the dirty ones,
'cause I like them best.

619
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,316
Well, this is gonna
knock your socks off.

620
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,650
Lot number 6
from the Delamont collection

621
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:25,249
is the one-of-a-kind
blue sapphire...

622
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:27,416
Where am I going?

623
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,283
Yes, thank you. I know.
Where is it?

624
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:32,383
Keep going and then
turn left at the end.

625
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,283
Evening, Nathan.

626
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,316
You got your boys in
to mess things up again?

627
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:45,516
Mike, nobody likes you,
even your wife.

628
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,550
Well, that's what
she told me, anyway,

629
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,283
whilst trying to
untangle herself
from my chest hairs.

630
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:52,216
<i>One day</i>
<i>you'll grow up, Nathan,</i>

631
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:54,717
and you'll realize
I've got more money,

632
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:57,083
more men, more intel.

633
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:58,817
You don't stand a chance.

634
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:00,583
<i>In which department?</i>

635
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:03,117
<i>She did whisper you have</i>
<i>an alarmingly small penis,</i>

636
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:05,616
<i>and I know you have</i>
<i>an incredibly small brain.</i>

637
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,651
<i>Is it me</i>
<i>that should be worried?</i>

638
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:10,182
<i>You still running operations</i>
<i>out of the back of your garage?</i>

639
00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:12,116
<i>At least I have an operation.</i>

640
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:14,083
<i>There's a difference between</i>
<i>you needing an operation</i>

641
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:15,583
<i>and me having an operation.</i>

642
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,249
<i>We're way ahead of you</i>
<i>on this, Nathan.</i>

643
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:19,483
<i>Outclassed as usual.</i>

644
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:21,516
<i>You'll only</i>
<i>mess this up like you do</i>
<i>all the others, Mike.</i>

645
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,182
<i>Stay out of my way.</i>

646
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:28,651
Let's be
a good little buggy.

647
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,083
Okay, what do I do now?

648
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,751
Emilia's in the room
the other side of that wall.

649
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,651
I can get a lock
if you stand there.

650
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:43,182
If I get any closer,
my ass is gonna go through it.

651
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:47,717
JJ, who is this guy?

652
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,283
Hurry up 'cause I'm on him.

653
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,149
<i>Okay, the phone's on now.</i>

654
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:02,149
Can I help you?

655
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:03,449
Oh, hi.

656
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,283
I was just looking
at this painting.

657
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,383
<i>Oh.</i>

658
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:09,550
I'm sorry, who are you?

659
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:10,751
Michaela.

660
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:15,116
I'm here
with Danny Francesco.

661
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,449
That's it.
I, uh-- I saw you earlier.

662
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:22,483
Greg told me he had this
amazing painting, and he knows
I'm an art lover, so...

663
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:26,216
I actually curate
Mr. Simmonds's collection.

664
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:29,416
-No way.
-Yeah. This is actually
an original Rhed.

665
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:31,516
Wow. Rhed with an H.

666
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,551
Wow.

667
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:37,116
You really know your stuff.
That's pretty esoteric.

668
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,516
Do you work in the arts?

669
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:41,817
No, I'm just an enthusiast.

670
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:45,416
Keep him talking.

671
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,684
I'm always curious about
the philosophical details

672
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,751
behind
a collector's motivation.

673
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:54,717
Mmm. We delving
somewhere deep here?

674
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,817
I don't know. Are we?

675
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,784
<i>All right, JJ.</i>
<i>I didn't need his life story.</i>

676
00:34:05,817 --> 00:34:08,216
<i>I just wanted his name.</i>
<i>Now disconnect his comms.</i>

677
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:09,817
Good evening, sir.

678
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:12,249
Vincent, is it?

679
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,182
Vincent, can I hear Orson?

680
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:19,116
Relax. Mike cannot
hear this conversation.

681
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:23,149
-Here you go, Mike.
You'll enjoy this.
-Vincent.

682
00:34:24,717 --> 00:34:26,717
Vincent.

683
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,116
Who's Mike?

684
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:31,684
We can play that game
if you wanna,

685
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:35,216
but one way or another,

686
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:36,684
you're gonna
swim to the shore.

687
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:39,484
Vincent.

688
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:42,449
Please continue.
Well, I'm interested in...

689
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:46,116
...the paradox
of dualistic motivation.

690
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:48,449
He will try and bribe you.
Don't listen.

691
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:52,517
The only question is,
are you gonna do it
with a broken nose...

692
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:56,416
or with your face intact...

693
00:34:58,349 --> 00:34:59,784
and this watch on your wrist.

694
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:02,216
<i>The canvas should be a portal</i>

695
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:06,283
into the abstract,
infinite, life-transcendent,

696
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:10,283
which, of course,
gives creative expression
its inner value.

697
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,249
Mike? Check in, Mi--

698
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:15,383
Fuck you, Orson.

699
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:17,851
Check in.

700
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,751
<i>Where's the paradox?</i>

701
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:24,349
The-- The paradox is that
there is beauty in the filth.

702
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:28,416
What else have you got?
Good question.

703
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,551
I admire a man
with a strong sense
of self-preservation.

704
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:38,417
However, there is a limit.

705
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:43,249
What was wrong
with the watch?

706
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:51,283
The most beautiful roses come
from the ugliest manure.

707
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,216
I feel like I'm on the couch.

708
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:00,082
You still got a minute to go.

709
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,551
Anyway, it's a theory.

710
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:03,617
I have no idea
if it has any credibility.

711
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:07,617
Where'd you get that from?
Have you got one for me?

712
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,417
Vincent.
One more chance...

713
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,182
while your nose
is still straight.

714
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:41,316
What's it in?

715
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,784
Left or the right?

716
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,283
It was the right.

717
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:53,182
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll take my watch back.

718
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,717
- Yes, Sarah.
<i>- Good work. Wrap it up.</i>

719
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:01,283
Rich people, if you,
um, hadn't noticed, they--
they like to show off.

720
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:03,182
I'm gonna head back.

721
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:05,584
Great chatting with you.

722
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:08,182
What's your name again?

723
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:10,149
Michaela. Mm-hmm.
Michaela.

724
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:11,751
Have a great night.
You too.

725
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:16,417
What's next
for Danny Francesco?

726
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,317
My next film role?
Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,384
Well,
I'm playing a mysterious,
self-made billionaire

728
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:28,617
who goes on a transcendental
journey from material genius
to spiritual giant.

729
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:31,317
Well, that's a bit spooky,
isn't it?

730
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,450
You just described me.

731
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,551
I don't--
Idea-- Danny, shush.

732
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:39,717
Idea: Why don't you come spend
a little bit of time with me

733
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:43,450
and, you know, do your research,
find your character, all that?

734
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:45,384
Charlie?

735
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:47,182
Michaela. Success?

736
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:49,617
Of course. Success?
<i>Success.</i>

737
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:51,350
Be with you shortly.

738
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:53,584
<i>Well, I will go rescue</i>
<i>the movie star, then.</i>

739
00:38:02,284 --> 00:38:04,617
Good luck, Vincent.

740
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:08,517
Michaela, my darling,
your boyfriend
wants to use me,

741
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:11,384
don't know why,
as inspiration
for his next film.

742
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,350
Gave me an idea.

743
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:15,751
Why don't you both come
and have a little vacation

744
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,551
in my Turkish villa
this weekend?

745
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:20,850
-Ooh.
-And Danny gets to
pick up some tips.

746
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:22,651
Shadow me, you know.

747
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:24,250
Do whatever I do.

748
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:26,450
Whatever I do do.
What do I do?

749
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:28,082
We'll find out.
You will.

750
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,517
Is that a good idea?

751
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,684
I mean, I have
a couple things going on,

752
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:35,717
but I think
I can rearrange some things.

753
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,850
You, Michaela,
have a lot going on.

754
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,116
- But what about this weekend?
- Oh. Yeah.

755
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:42,517
Gregory, how are you?

756
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,149
Oh, Lord. Look who's here.

757
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:50,116
Well, we've been
waiting for you to introduce us
to Danny Francesco.

758
00:38:50,149 --> 00:38:53,617
Of course you have.
Danny, I'd like you to meet
my very good friends

759
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:55,750
Alexander and Natalya,

760
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:57,584
and big Yiv...
Alexander.

761
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,484
...and the sulky Katya...
Yes.

762
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:01,149
...and somewhat scary Dimitry.

763
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:02,783
Dimitry,
nice to meet you.
Yes.

764
00:39:02,816 --> 00:39:04,684
Man,
I'm such a fan, you know.

765
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:06,317
Uh, you mind if I, uh...
Selfie?

766
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,149
Yes.
Selfie time.
Let's do it.

767
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,250
Yeah. Be gentle with him.
Yes, um...

768
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:11,783
Go on, then.
Danny, please.

769
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,116
-Yes.
-This way. Yeah, good.

770
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:16,384
Wait. Wait, wait. Yes.
Yeah, good.
Good. Uh...

771
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,182
This is fantastic.
Okay. Everyone, just--
Yeah.

772
00:39:19,217 --> 00:39:21,417
Why don't you just crowd
around a little tighter.

773
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,651
They're like piranhas,
aren't they?
Yeah.

774
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,384
Now, that is a feeding frenzy.

775
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,750
Another one. Whoa!
Okay.

776
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,350
Wait. Not finished yet.
No, I think we got it.

777
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:30,551
He's gonna come out of there
a skeleton.

778
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,683
Very, very nice to meet you.

779
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:36,651
Just watch where you're
putting your hands, Dimitry.

780
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:41,082
Why are you looking at me
like that, Greg?

781
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:44,683
I think you know
why I'm looking at you
like that.

782
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,484
And you know
that I'm spoken for.

783
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:51,551
Oh, I do,
and I respect that. I do.

784
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:54,484
But will you allow me
to flatter you for a moment?

785
00:39:55,816 --> 00:39:59,284
Danny is a famous actor,
and that is very impressive.

786
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:03,650
But actors all work
for someone, don't they?

787
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:08,584
You strike me as someone
who doesn't take orders.

788
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:11,116
Well-- No.
 Shush, 'cause I'm talking.

789
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,417
I think you're a free spirit.

790
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm not sure
what that means.

791
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,284
It's been a pleasure.
It's been an absolute--

792
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:23,384
You remember in this movie
when you were
a kick-ass bad guy?

793
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:24,750
You're so good.
I get some--

794
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:27,484
Come here.

795
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:36,716
The world is a much,
much bigger place
than you can possibly imagine.

796
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:41,783
Allow me to show it to you.

797
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,750
Eh?

798
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:50,082
Hmm?

799
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,183
Michaela.

800
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,683
Hello, Charlie.
Yes.

801
00:40:53,716 --> 00:40:55,816
Does our superstar
need rescuing?
Great. Yes.

802
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,417
Hey, Danny. Shall we?

803
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,450
Michaela.
Mmm.

804
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:02,783
Think about
what I said, yeah?
Mmm.

805
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:05,082
Hey, look, Danny.
Your manager is here
to save you.

806
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:07,350
I gotta take him away
before you three birds

807
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,117
chew the meat off his bones.

808
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,350
-Danny, take my hand.
-Danny. Come on, please!

809
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:13,716
Oh!

810
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,384
Hey, Danny, stay! Come on!

811
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,350
- Hey, man. I love you.
- Danny, come back.

812
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:18,750
- We love you so much.
- Come on.

813
00:41:18,783 --> 00:41:21,150
Danny, you're my man.
Man, I love you, man.

814
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:23,150
Look, these
beautiful pictures.
Ah, look.

815
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:25,284
Ha! Dimitry,
your tongue is hanging out,

816
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,783
and your hand
is on his cock.

817
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:29,250
Danny, you should be
proud of yourself.

818
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:32,583
Yeah, looks
like we may be going away
for the weekend with Greggy.

819
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,517
You guys have to stop
doing this to me.

820
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,217
I don't know if that was
the most exhilarating
moment of my life

821
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,117
or the most terrifying
moment of my life,

822
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,217
but Danny Francesco
playing Danny Francesco,

823
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,816
that is the way forward.

824
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,250
<i>Congratulations, team.</i>
<i>A successful evening.</i>

825
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:09,783
Debrief at 0700.
Good work.

826
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:12,217
<i>Well, well, Greg.</i>

827
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,683
<i>Well, Alexander,</i>

828
00:42:13,716 --> 00:42:17,250
at your new, improved
summer sale price

829
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:20,050
that is the $10 billion...

830
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:22,716
we have a deal.

831
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,616
Fantastic!

832
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,384
So, who's buying?

833
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,484
<i>No, not telling you that.</i>

834
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,117
My job is to protect
every link in this chain.

835
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,183
So I do protect them, yes,
but I'm also protecting you.

836
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:44,550
So what happens now
is that I tell them
that you are delighted,

837
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,850
and they will be delighted,
and then we can all
be delighted together.

838
00:42:47,883 --> 00:42:50,083
We should celebrate now.

839
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:52,317
We should. Uh, Emilia.

840
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,450
Get one of them really
stupid bottles of vodka.

841
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:58,384
You know, the one
with the five-carat rock
in the top.

842
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:00,650
You'll love that.

843
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,583
I do wish you'd communicate
with your other departments.

844
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:08,117
Someone is feeding Mike
information, inside information.

845
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,483
<i>It doesn't</i>
<i>look like Mike is working for</i>
<i>anyone in this government.</i>

846
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:14,716
I'll need more time
to find out which government
he's working for.

847
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,850
Now, tell me what you have.

848
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:20,716
We still can't confirm
it's the Handle.

849
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,516
What we do know
is that Alexander is selling
something for $10 billion.

850
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,716
<i>Greg Simmonds</i>
<i>is brokering the deal.</i>

851
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,083
And who's the buyer?

852
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:31,183
Still a mystery.

853
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:35,384
But it won't remain one
for long.

854
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:38,117
Well, I think
Orson is right.

855
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,117
Greg has a thing
for stealing girlfriends,

856
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,583
especially from movie stars.

857
00:43:43,616 --> 00:43:45,716
So accept his offer
to go away.

858
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,716
That's a vulnerable
position.

859
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,449
I've dealt with much worse
than Greg Simmonds before,
believe me.

860
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:53,150
Vulnerable?
Just be aware if they need
to get out quick,

861
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:54,550
it might not be that easy.

862
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,650
At some point,
the movie star's gonna melt.

863
00:43:56,683 --> 00:43:58,183
I'm sure he'll be fine.

864
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,317
What did you find
on Trent and Arnold?

865
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,284
Our biotech billionaires
are buying up
an awful lot of gold.

866
00:44:03,317 --> 00:44:05,107
Other than that,
not a great deal.

867
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:07,771
At least we know
that Alexander and his friends
are involved.

868
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,083
Whatever they're selling
has now got Greg very excited.

869
00:44:10,116 --> 00:44:11,683
Yeah. I found out
where they're staying,

870
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,283
but their computers
are impossible to hack.

871
00:44:13,316 --> 00:44:15,050
I don't know how long
it's gonna take me to get in.

872
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,189
Options?

873
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,050
Quickest way

874
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,816
is to physically install
software on their computers.

875
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:24,083
You mean break in and
install via a thumb drive?

876
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:27,916
-Yes, that's the most
direct way to do it.
-This one's for you, then.

877
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,950
-Really? I thought
I was the footman.
-No, a tech whiz.

878
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,983
-Yeah, and you're the hammer.
-Hammer?

879
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,916
If there's a problem,
I'll do it.

880
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,483
No, there's not a problem, JJ.

881
00:44:37,016 --> 00:44:38,150
I'll do it.

882
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:39,983
I can get
inside Alexander's.

883
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,750
I hope you take him
to dinner first.

884
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:45,617
Before you get
inside of him.

885
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:49,130
S... Se--

886
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:58,950
<i>You are over the wall.</i>
<i>Neatly done.</i>

887
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,550
And we are redirecting
the air con.

888
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,816
And they're all
sleeping like babies now.

889
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,850
They're not gonna
wake up anytime soon.

890
00:45:25,883 --> 00:45:27,916
<i>You are safe to enter.</i>

891
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,783
<i>Doors opening now.</i>

892
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,883
Up the stairs, first floor,
bedroom on the left.

893
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,783
<i>Once you've installed</i>
<i>the thumb drive,</i>

894
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:02,483
<i>cover your tracks</i>
<i>and make it look</i>
<i>like a robbery.</i>

895
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:04,050
<i>Swag some watches,</i>

896
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:07,517
<i>crack the safe</i>
<i>and bag some cash, baby.</i>

897
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,883
<i>The more you bag,</i>
<i>the better it looks.</i>

898
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:31,749
<i>No time</i> <i>to watch TV, sweetheart.
</i> <i>Get to work.</i>

899
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:31,483
<i>Find the laptop?</i>

900
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,483
Found.

901
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:37,783
And now I'd like you
to plug in that drive
and slap enter.

902
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:41,117
<i>Whatever they control,</i>
<i>I can control better.</i>

903
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:44,051
<i>We have full access</i>
<i>to their computer.</i>

904
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,482
Now that you've sucked it dry,
return to safe.

905
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:04,482
There are still
two guards patrolling.

906
00:48:04,516 --> 00:48:06,084
<i>Exit via the front door.</i>

907
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:13,017
Nicely done, sweetheart.
We'll pick you up
at the front gate.

908
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:24,916
Don't move!

909
00:48:29,151 --> 00:48:30,482
Don't--

910
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:53,549
What's that?

911
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:55,516
It's a guard dog.

912
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:58,749
Guard, dog.

913
00:48:58,783 --> 00:49:01,449
-I'm good with a dog.
-Lucky, that.

914
00:49:02,716 --> 00:49:04,583
-What about your mate?
-Power nap.

915
00:49:04,616 --> 00:49:05,951
He'll be all right
in a minute.

916
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,951
Okay, are you guys done?
I heard a gunshot.

917
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:11,117
Shh. Shh.

918
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:13,516
-Is anyone dead?
-No.

919
00:49:13,549 --> 00:49:14,783
No thanks to you.

920
00:49:14,816 --> 00:49:16,951
-What?
-You said it was clear.

921
00:49:16,984 --> 00:49:20,583
-I said the front was clear.
-I came out the front.

922
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:23,051
Yeah, you know, they usually
keep the Olympic-size
swimming pools

923
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:24,516
in the back of the house.

924
00:49:31,816 --> 00:49:33,117
Ah.

925
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:35,084
Front, back, right, wrong.

926
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:36,449
Right, wrong.

927
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:37,716
Whatever.

928
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,051
Anyway, shall we?

929
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:48,917
- JJ.
- Sir.

930
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:50,549
Morning.
Morning.

931
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,449
Sarah says I didn't
miss much last night.

932
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:54,683
- In and out.
 -So you weren't seen by anyone?

933
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:56,984
-Yes.
-That's a yes,
you weren't seen by anyone?

934
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:00,449
-Yes.
-Or a yes,
you were seen by someone?

935
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,117
-Yes.
-Childish.

936
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:04,984
Nothing you need to
worry about, Nathan.

937
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:07,516
You just concentrate
on your gluten-free,
lactose-intolerant,

938
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:08,783
bunny-stroking breakfast.

939
00:50:08,816 --> 00:50:09,733
Boys, done?

940
00:50:09,792 --> 00:50:12,357
I pulled this off
of Alexander's laptop.

941
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:14,792
Looks like the deal's
all agreed to on their side,

942
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:16,959
and there's an escrow account
linked.

943
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:19,624
What are they selling?
We still don't know.

944
00:50:19,658 --> 00:50:20,926
So we could be
wasting our time.

945
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:22,868
Hang on.
Activity on Greg's phone.

946
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:25,216
<i>- Yes?</i>
<i>- Greg, you're on speaker.</i>

947
00:50:25,249 --> 00:50:28,436
I'm with Arnold, enjoying
the view from up here.

948
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:31,816
<i>You're back</i> <i>in Disneyland already?
</i> <i>Didn't hang about, did you?</i>

949
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:33,783
What'd you do,
beam yourselves there?

950
00:50:33,816 --> 00:50:37,251
Don't go mad, darling.
Yesterday I looked
like fucking candy.

951
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,284
You're lucky
we made your party at all.

952
00:50:39,317 --> 00:50:42,783
- Your choice of friends is questionable.
<i>- You're not wrong.</i>

953
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:46,582
But I'd argue that they
are acquaintances, not friends.

954
00:50:46,616 --> 00:50:49,084
And yes,
we did raise a lot of money
for the war orphans.

955
00:50:49,117 --> 00:50:50,749
Thank you for caring.

956
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:52,883
Put a load of rich lowbrows
in a room together,

957
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,883
they'll always outbid
one another

958
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:57,649
in the name of
egotistical competition
and ostentation.

959
00:50:57,682 --> 00:50:59,883
Which is kind of the point,
Trent.

960
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,682
<i>Didn't have you down</i>
<i>as an angry anticapitalist.</i>

961
00:51:02,716 --> 00:51:05,051
No, we are anticapitalist.

962
00:51:05,084 --> 00:51:07,251
Anti-other-capitalists.

963
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:10,251
I'll tell you what, boys.
I've got another call coming in.

964
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,816
Thank you, my darling.
Thank you, sir.

965
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:13,217
<i>You better take it, then.</i>

966
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:14,916
So what was the point
of this one?

967
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,984
Just to check we're okay.

968
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:18,984
<i>Yes, we are okay.</i>

969
00:51:19,017 --> 00:51:21,949
<i>Just remember,</i>
<i>yellow is the color</i>
<i>and gold is the game.</i>

970
00:51:21,984 --> 00:51:24,682
- And I still love you.
- We'll speak later.

971
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:25,949
Hello, Qasim.

972
00:51:27,716 --> 00:51:28,849
<i>Go on.</i>

973
00:51:30,682 --> 00:51:32,184
And? Everything set?

974
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:36,816
<i>Why?</i>

975
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:51,783
Don't move!

976
00:51:53,716 --> 00:51:54,749
I will shoot you.

977
00:51:56,051 --> 00:51:58,849
Don't shoot! Don't hurt me.

978
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,816
Come on. I-- Take my hands!

979
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:05,117
No police. No prison.
I've got kids!

980
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:08,649
Sir. Sorry, sir.

981
00:52:08,682 --> 00:52:11,251
He's crying for mama.
Not a problem.

982
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:33,184
You shot my foot!

983
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:34,849
Shh!

984
00:52:34,883 --> 00:52:36,682
No cry for mama.

985
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:38,351
Psst, psst, psst.

986
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:40,749
This is the kind of thing
I need to know about.

987
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,284
Shh. You dropped
your chopsticks.

988
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:44,682
You got shit on your face.

989
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:45,716
<i>Should I be worried?</i>

990
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:55,017
<i>You keep me informed, Qasim.</i>

991
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:56,616
<i>Goody goody then.</i>

992
00:52:56,649 --> 00:52:58,616
"Flying fowl" in 72 hours?

993
00:52:58,649 --> 00:52:59,950
What the cuss
does that mean?

994
00:52:59,984 --> 00:53:01,950
I got a location
on Qasim's phone.

995
00:53:01,984 --> 00:53:04,849
If Alexander and his team
are entering another country
illegally,

996
00:53:04,884 --> 00:53:07,849
they're gonna need help
avoiding any risks
with the authorities.

997
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,682
So where's this Qasim based?

998
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:14,184
Antalya, Turkey.
Gobble, gobble.

999
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:16,917
That's "flying fowl"
with a W, not a U.

1000
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,816
Hence "flying fowl,"
flying to Turkey.

1001
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,350
Bit of a reach.

1002
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:26,017
You'd think so,
except Qasim Amari
is a diplomat

1003
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:28,582
located in the, uh,
Turkish government's office
in Antalya, Turkey.

1004
00:53:28,616 --> 00:53:29,917
I don't know how I do it.

1005
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,616
What a brain.

1006
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:34,649
Do I have a brain in there?
Oh, she does.

1007
00:53:34,682 --> 00:53:37,616
Modern women.
What will they think of next?

1008
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:40,251
- So, looks like
we're all flying fowl.
- Amazing.

1009
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:42,884
We'll track Qasim,
see where he leads us.

1010
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:44,749
Sarah, you go with Danny
as planned

1011
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:46,950
and find out from Greg
exactly what it is
he's buying.

1012
00:53:46,984 --> 00:53:48,682
We need a confirmation
on that.

1013
00:53:48,716 --> 00:53:52,117
Explains why Greggy's spending
his weekend in Turkey.

1014
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:02,582
There's a term
for being beaten
in four moves, Nathan:

1015
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:06,316
-Fool's Mate.
-Wasn't four moves.

1016
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,284
If you can get yourself
out of that little mess
I put you in,

1017
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,084
you can have a glass of this.

1018
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:13,151
What we got on Qasim, JJ?

1019
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,616
Libyan diplomat based
all over the world.

1020
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:20,217
Met Greg Simmonds
in the 2000s, who put him
on the payroll soon after.

1021
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:24,350
Qasim's been greasing palms
and burying bodies for Greg
ever since.

1022
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:26,649
Nice work.

1023
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:28,817
Have a glass of this.
Wine's not really my thing.

1024
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,316
Is that the 2004?

1025
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,217
Who's talking to you?
Aren't you busy enough?

1026
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:35,251
There's wine
and then there's wine.

1027
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:37,217
Don't force the poor man.

1028
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:44,350
Whoo!

1029
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:47,051
Congratulations,
Dr. Frankenstein.

1030
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,850
You've created
another monster.

1031
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:52,784
Nathan, you don't put
fish fat oil in a Ferrari.

1032
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,884
Whoo!

1033
00:55:14,184 --> 00:55:16,750
Ah, little Miss Paradox.

1034
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:18,151
She got in your head yet?

1035
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:22,084
-Hey, good to see ya.
-You too.

1036
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:25,649
There they are,
my new best friends.

1037
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:28,151
<i>Hosgeldiniz,</i>
as we say in Turkey.

1038
00:55:28,184 --> 00:55:30,117
Mmm. Thank you
for the jet.

1039
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:32,582
Oh, don't be silly.
That's the baby one.

1040
00:55:32,616 --> 00:55:35,151
-Danny Francesco, yeah.
-It's good to see you, Greg.

1041
00:55:35,184 --> 00:55:37,649
Excited to be here,
learn from the master.

1042
00:55:37,682 --> 00:55:40,216
Oh, no, I'm not the master.

1043
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,084
Now, before
we do anything else,

1044
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:44,784
follow me
'cause I have something
to show you.

1045
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:46,850
Grab a drink on the way.

1046
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:48,817
'75 Corniche, Greggy.
I love it.

1047
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:51,549
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
Present from Elton, that one.

1048
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,884
Wait a second.
That looks exactly like
the car that I drove--

1049
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,682
Do you know why?
Do you know why?

1050
00:55:58,582 --> 00:56:01,283
- That's not possible.
- Oh, yeah.

1051
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,750
Oh, yeah, it is.

1052
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:05,283
Lovingly restored
with me own hands.

1053
00:56:05,316 --> 00:56:06,950
It's not really
with me own hands.

1054
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:09,051
I'm just joking.

1055
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:11,117
- It's nice though, isn't it?
- I--

1056
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:14,316
Look at him.

1057
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:16,582
I drove this car myself.

1058
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:17,884
I know, honey.

1059
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,784
And, Michaela,
did his own stunts.

1060
00:56:19,817 --> 00:56:21,683
Is that true, Danny?
Yeah.

1061
00:56:21,717 --> 00:56:24,884
-Could you still do 'em?
-I'm a little rusty, but sure.

1062
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:27,950
Right, game on.
After lunch, yes?

1063
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:31,616
Okay. I might have to
sit that one out,
but you boys have fun.

1064
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:34,817
After lunch, Michaela,
you are having the pleasure

1065
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,051
of a four-hands,
hot stones massage
with Suki and Sasha.

1066
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:43,051
And they really,
really understand
a lady's geography.

1067
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:44,283
Isn't that right, Emilia?

1068
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:45,950
Yes, they do.

1069
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:47,283
Sounds fabulous.

1070
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:48,784
She looks nervous.

1071
00:56:48,817 --> 00:56:50,084
Oh, believe me, I'm not.

1072
00:56:50,117 --> 00:56:52,683
You even have my prop gun!

1073
00:56:52,717 --> 00:56:55,549
Yeah, yeah, it is.
But it's not a prop anymore,
Danny, so steady, yeah?

1074
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:58,650
I cannot believe
you got this car.
Yeah.

1075
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,917
I wanted this car
so bad.
Did you? Did you?

1076
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:03,582
How much did you want it,
Danny?

1077
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:06,216
Of all the cars
I've driven on-screen,

1078
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,350
this is the only car
I wanted to possess.

1079
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:12,051
-Is that right?
Did you crave it?
-Yeah.

1080
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:14,350
-Did you yearn for it?
-Yeah.

1081
00:57:14,383 --> 00:57:16,116
Did you dream about it?

1082
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,017
I longed for it.

1083
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:20,250
Do you know what?

1084
00:57:20,283 --> 00:57:22,051
It's yours.
Come on, let's have lunch.

1085
00:57:23,717 --> 00:57:25,250
-What?
-It's yours.

1086
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,116
Come on!

1087
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,884
All right.

1088
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,017
Do you like kebabs?

1089
00:57:36,683 --> 00:57:37,884
What's in the bag?

1090
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,183
Nothing.

1091
00:57:39,216 --> 00:57:41,717
So you're carrying
an empty bag?

1092
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,150
You nicked the Margaux,
didn't ya?

1093
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:45,017
"Nicked"
is a little bit strong.

1094
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:47,183
Leaving half a bottle
of Margaux on a plane?

1095
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:48,650
So you're
a doggie bag man.

1096
00:57:48,683 --> 00:57:50,150
Do you have any idea
what it costs?

1097
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:52,017
He has no idea
how much it costs.

1098
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,750
Short arms, long pockets.
Room keys.

1099
00:57:54,784 --> 00:57:56,283
Meet down here
in 60 minutes?

1100
00:57:56,316 --> 00:57:57,950
We're off
to track the Libyan.

1101
00:58:00,283 --> 00:58:02,817
-What are you doing?
That's my key.
-I know what it is.

1102
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,784
I also know
you've given yourself
the biggest room.

1103
00:58:04,817 --> 00:58:06,650
How do you know I haven't
already switched them?

1104
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,650
Fuck off, Nathan.

1105
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:10,917
You haven't got
the bandwidth for that.

1106
00:58:12,116 --> 00:58:16,650
I can't believe it.
I'm in the car with the actor.

1107
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:19,017
Is the back end still bulletproof?
 It feels a little squirrelly.

1108
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,283
Oh, yeah.
Unique selling point.

1109
00:58:21,316 --> 00:58:24,784
So, tell me, how did
the leap from millionaire
to billionaire change you?

1110
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:26,750
Right. Interesting question

1111
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:31,183
and, I imagine,
my cue to say money
doesn't make you happier.

1112
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,650
I'll tell you what, Danny,
it fucking does.

1113
00:58:34,683 --> 00:58:38,817
It does.
I'm really happy now and--
and a nicer person too.

1114
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,884
I worry about things.
I worry about the world.

1115
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,617
I worry about
the war orphans.

1116
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,583
You don't strike me
as a worrier, Greg.

1117
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:46,283
Yeah, well,
you don't strike me

1118
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:48,950
as someone who drives like
a little girlie, but you do.

1119
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,650
Oh, is that how it is?

1120
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:53,050
Whoa!

1121
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,950
Slow down,
Danny Francesco.

1122
00:58:54,984 --> 00:58:59,016
You are driving me
into my dreams!

1123
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,683
Everything all right,
Michaela?

1124
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:29,617
Yeah. Oh, my God,
this place is massive.

1125
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,617
And wow,
this piece is beautiful.

1126
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,316
Um, Mimar Sinan.

1127
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,750
-Are you looking for your room?
-Yes.

1128
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:40,617
Mm-hmm.
My room is that way.

1129
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,116
It's actually the other way.

1130
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,950
Of course.

1131
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:46,583
Down the corridor,
turn right,
and it's on your left.

1132
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:49,050
Hey, that massage
was so good, by the way.

1133
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:51,717
-Y-You should join us next time.
-Turn right.

1134
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,983
Right. Got it.

1135
00:59:54,016 --> 00:59:55,583
Okay, I'll see you later.

1136
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:09,016
Qasim's out.

1137
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,817
We following?
Not yet.

1138
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,116
Looks like he's en route
for a coffee.

1139
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:25,350
Oh, hello.
How does he do it?

1140
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:27,116
Mike?

1141
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,216
Doesn't matter
how he's done it. He's done it.

1142
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,717
-It's Mike, isn't it?
-How's he getting
his information?

1143
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,583
<i>Ground control?</i>

1144
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:37,083
- Can you hear me, Major Tom?
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>

1145
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:39,683
<i>How are we getting on?</i>

1146
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:42,050
Looping monitor.

1147
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,316
They have some sort
of adolescent firewall.

1148
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,717
It's taking me about a minute
to perforate it.

1149
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,316
Done.

1150
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,183
Looks like he's had enough
of that paper.

1151
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:57,617
Qasim's off,
and Mike's going with him.

1152
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:58,850
We following?

1153
01:00:58,883 --> 01:01:00,683
No, let Mike play that game.

1154
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:02,083
My money's on the paper.

1155
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,150
Whatever you say, boss.

1156
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:05,650
You want an ice cream?

1157
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,083
And I am in.

1158
01:01:16,116 --> 01:01:17,183
Great.

1159
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,983
What's he buying?

1160
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:20,583
Hold on.

1161
01:01:20,617 --> 01:01:23,083
I picked up a file
sent by Qasim.

1162
01:01:23,116 --> 01:01:24,949
He's using RSA encryption.

1163
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:26,916
Huh.

1164
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,817
- Well, that's disappointing.
<i>- What?</i>

1165
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,983
Well, it looks like
Greg's up to no good.

1166
01:01:33,016 --> 01:01:36,216
But not spectacularly no good,
just no good.

1167
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,849
Don't be mean, Sarah.
Give me something.

1168
01:01:38,883 --> 01:01:41,650
Greg is buying containers
of stolen AK-47s.

1169
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:43,583
Yes, very funny.
Now, seriously, what is it?

1170
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,583
No, I am serious.

1171
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:47,283
<i>We've got it wrong.</i>

1172
01:01:47,316 --> 01:01:48,784
<i>See for yourself.</i>

1173
01:01:56,817 --> 01:01:58,050
Oh, hello.

1174
01:01:58,083 --> 01:01:59,550
We've seen him before.

1175
01:02:02,817 --> 01:02:05,683
Shall we?
I'll get the ice creams,
you get the wheel.

1176
01:02:05,717 --> 01:02:07,683
<i>Can't be, Sarah.</i>

1177
01:02:07,717 --> 01:02:10,116
<i>All that fuss over</i>
<i>30 million dollars'</i>
<i>worth of guns?</i>

1178
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,150
<i>It's too small a crime</i>
<i>for too big a player.</i>

1179
01:02:12,183 --> 01:02:14,583
<i>If it's a cover,</i>
<i>it's a very good one.</i>

1180
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:17,351
<i>It's enough evidence to feel</i>
<i>his collar, but not enough</i>
<i>to choke him with it.</i>

1181
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:19,216
Understood,

1182
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,250
<i>but there's nothing linking</i>
<i>this deal to the Handle.</i>

1183
01:02:22,283 --> 01:02:25,351
Pooh. Get out of there
and get back as soon as you can.

1184
01:02:25,384 --> 01:02:28,016
Let me just dig a bit deeper

1185
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:31,216
and find some evidence
we can hold over him
for a rainy day.

1186
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,550
<i>Okay, but be quick.</i>

1187
01:02:33,384 --> 01:02:36,650
- Orson, you there?
<i>- What is it?</i>

1188
01:02:36,683 --> 01:02:38,916
Time to come in.
We were wrong.

1189
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:41,883
<i>It's not the Handle,</i>
<i>it's firearms. We're following</i>
<i>the wrong rabbit.</i>

1190
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,949
You go back to bed.
Leave this with me.

1191
01:02:43,983 --> 01:02:45,816
<i>Sarah's shown me proof.</i>

1192
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,250
Forget it. We're done.

1193
01:02:47,284 --> 01:02:49,083
I don't think so.

1194
01:02:49,116 --> 01:02:52,216
We're back with
our old friend Ben Harris.

1195
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,083
If Greg has Ben involved,

1196
01:02:54,116 --> 01:02:57,284
there's no way that this deal
is about guns.

1197
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:59,883
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Follow him, but do not engage.</i>

1198
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:01,650
<i>I'll let Sarah know</i>
<i>we're still in play.</i>

1199
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,317
<i>You got me, JJ?</i>

1200
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,317
I've got a lock on you, boss.

1201
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,083
<i>Do we pick him up?</i>
No.

1202
01:03:28,783 --> 01:03:29,983
Cat follows mouse.

1203
01:03:42,183 --> 01:03:43,749
<i>Can you get a lock</i>
<i>onto his phone?</i>

1204
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:45,216
Yeah, if you get close enough.

1205
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,216
<i>Stay within 50 meters.</i>

1206
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:49,617
<i>I can use your phone</i>
<i>to lock onto his signal.</i>

1207
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,849
Quicker if he uses it.

1208
01:03:50,883 --> 01:03:52,683
Get close enough
to raise suspicion,

1209
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:54,916
<i>but not too close so he bolts.</i>

1210
01:03:54,949 --> 01:03:56,949
<i>That will initiate him</i>
<i>activating his phone.</i>

1211
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:02,783
Are we being followed?

1212
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:10,183
<i>He sent a text.</i>
<i>I blocked it.</i>

1213
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,783
I've got him. I've locked on.

1214
01:04:16,317 --> 01:04:17,650
I've blocked his call.

1215
01:04:19,351 --> 01:04:21,183
Can't get through.
No signal.

1216
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:25,883
Deal with that.
Yes, sir.

1217
01:04:28,716 --> 01:04:30,184
Lost?

1218
01:04:30,217 --> 01:04:32,783
Thank you, sir.
Maybe you can help me.

1219
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:34,749
I'm looking for
the, uh, harbor.

1220
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:36,983
This way, sir.
Oh.

1221
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:44,783
<i>Hang on. I've just</i>
<i>jammed another message.</i>

1222
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,284
We're burned.
He's recognized ya.

1223
01:04:50,749 --> 01:04:51,949
That's strange,

1224
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:55,749
'cause, uh,
according to the map,

1225
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:58,116
it says this way.

1226
01:04:58,151 --> 01:05:00,050
No. This way, sir.

1227
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:02,849
Oh.

1228
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,783
Ah! Amazing.

1229
01:05:05,816 --> 01:05:08,151
You're absolutely right.
Thank you.

1230
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:25,116
Got to pick him up.
He's gonna run.

1231
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:42,317
<i>Orson, if he gets</i> <i>out of range, I can't block</i> <i>his signal.
 Get after him.</i>

1232
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:54,083
<i>He's in the building</i>
<i>on the left.</i>

1233
01:06:04,783 --> 01:06:06,749
<i>He's ten meters, straight on.</i>

1234
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:13,284
Hey!

1235
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:18,284
JJ, he's on two wheels.
Talk to me.

1236
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:19,916
Fifteen meters, take a right.

1237
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:31,616
Left or right, JJ?
<i>Sharp left.</i>

1238
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:33,816
He's getting out of range.

1239
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:02,184
- <i>JJ, speak to me.</i>
- He's stopped moving.

1240
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:03,783
<i>He's right in front of ya.</i>

1241
01:07:10,017 --> 01:07:11,151
Missed him.

1242
01:07:11,184 --> 01:07:12,317
- Stairs?
<i>- Take a right.</i>

1243
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,582
Afternoon.

1244
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:31,682
Excuse me.

1245
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:33,849
Can you, uh, take a picture
of me and the view?

1246
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:38,184
They're only stairs.
Go on, move yourself.

1247
01:07:38,217 --> 01:07:40,184
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>I'll sit in the car.</i>
<i>You do the chasing.</i>

1248
01:07:40,217 --> 01:07:42,251
Let me take a look.

1249
01:07:45,883 --> 01:07:47,184
Oh, beautiful.

1250
01:07:47,217 --> 01:07:49,117
Give me your phone.
Let me take one of you.

1251
01:07:50,883 --> 01:07:52,251
<i>He's still there.</i>

1252
01:08:02,384 --> 01:08:03,984
There's no one here.

1253
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:06,051
<i>I'm telling ya,</i>
<i>he's right there.</i>

1254
01:08:06,084 --> 01:08:07,949
<i>You're on top</i>
<i>of his phone now.</i>

1255
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,084
Ah, Jesus.
What did he do that for?

1256
01:08:12,117 --> 01:08:14,716
<i>Hold on,</i>
<i>I'm just pulling up.</i>

1257
01:08:14,749 --> 01:08:18,317
<i>There's a body</i> <i>all over the floor 200 feet</i> <i>below me.
 It's Harris.</i>

1258
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:21,184
Get the phone, the paper...

1259
01:08:22,816 --> 01:08:24,151
...and get the body
in the back.

1260
01:08:29,682 --> 01:08:30,950
That isn't Ben Harris.

1261
01:08:30,984 --> 01:08:33,582
What do you mean
it's not Ben Harris?

1262
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:42,749
That's Ben Harris.

1263
01:08:53,117 --> 01:08:54,984
Is he in the back?

1264
01:08:55,017 --> 01:08:56,582
Yeah, he's in the back.

1265
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:04,950
<i>So, Nathan, can you now confirm?</i>

1266
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:08,084
<i>The file Sarah extracted</i>
<i>from Greg's computer</i>

1267
01:09:08,117 --> 01:09:11,084
<i>was actually the data key</i>
<i>that unlocked the Bakker drive,</i>

1268
01:09:11,117 --> 01:09:12,883
confirming it is the Handle.

1269
01:09:12,917 --> 01:09:14,117
So what is it?

1270
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:17,682
The first of its kind
programmable AI.

1271
01:09:17,716 --> 01:09:21,284
Our people had hoped
it was still in the post,

1272
01:09:21,317 --> 01:09:24,184
but now it seems
the post has been delivered.

1273
01:09:24,217 --> 01:09:27,984
It can hack any system,
even other AI programs.

1274
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:30,084
- With what end?
<i>- To any end.</i>

1275
01:09:30,117 --> 01:09:33,317
It can launch a nuclear strike
and then cover its own tracks,

1276
01:09:33,351 --> 01:09:36,017
pointing the finger
at whomever it wants to blame.

1277
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:40,317
<i>Whatever is run by a computer,</i>
<i>it can control.</i>

1278
01:09:40,351 --> 01:09:43,582
And we still don't know
what they intend
to use it for.

1279
01:09:43,616 --> 01:09:44,849
<i>Yes.</i>

1280
01:09:44,884 --> 01:09:46,749
<i>But we can at least</i>
<i>now confirm</i>

1281
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:48,749
<i>that Alexander is indeed</i>
<i>selling the Handle,</i>

1282
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:52,151
<i>with Greg Simmonds</i>
<i>brokering the deal</i>
<i>for $10 billion.</i>

1283
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:54,051
Confirmed.

1284
01:09:54,084 --> 01:09:55,884
<i>So, what now?</i>

1285
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:57,749
When's the transaction
gonna take place?

1286
01:09:57,783 --> 01:09:59,350
Deal's set for 9:00 a.m.

1287
01:09:59,383 --> 01:10:03,117
Between the newspaper
and info extracted
from his phone,

1288
01:10:03,151 --> 01:10:06,917
<i>Ben Harris was to be picked up</i>
<i>from Hotel Amara's lobby</i>

1289
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,051
<i>by Alexander's representative</i>

1290
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:12,816
<i>and taken to the exchange</i>
<i>to transfer the escrow.</i>

1291
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,284
He still needs to call Greg
to get a 15-digit passcode.

1292
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:19,884
So, inconveniently,
we do still need Ben Harris.

1293
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:23,117
Could've done
without him dying, but still.

1294
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:24,649
Childish.

1295
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:25,984
Can we make me Ben Harris?

1296
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:27,850
Go on.

1297
01:10:27,884 --> 01:10:29,582
They don't know
what he looks like.

1298
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:31,850
<i>He guarded his visual identity</i>
<i>very closely.</i>

1299
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:34,783
<i>Mr. Harris?</i>
Yes.

1300
01:10:34,817 --> 01:10:37,316
<i>There is a green</i>
<i>G-Wagon outside.</i>

1301
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,051
<i>My men will escort you.</i>

1302
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,783
I'll do the deal myself.

1303
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:44,950
But you'll have to talk
to Greg on the phone.

1304
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,151
It's a pleasure
to meet with you,
Mr. Harris.

1305
01:10:58,184 --> 01:10:59,749
Your phone, please.

1306
01:11:02,749 --> 01:11:03,984
Anything else?

1307
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:06,017
Nothing else.

1308
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,950
Do you mind?
Please.

1309
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:19,884
I can make you look like him,
but I can't make you
sound like him.

1310
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,749
Don't we know someone
who can?

1311
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:25,117
I'll tell you what,
Danny, Michaela.

1312
01:11:25,151 --> 01:11:27,051
It's a gift.

1313
01:11:27,084 --> 01:11:29,716
It is a gift. My dad had it.
It's like a party trick
for him.

1314
01:11:29,749 --> 01:11:32,884
Didn't matter what it was.
Could be a toy,
could be a pair of shoes.

1315
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:36,316
He could put his hand on it,
shut his eyes
and tell you the price.

1316
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:39,682
He'd go, "14.99."
No, he could. He could. You--

1317
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:42,616
Don't stop on my account.
I have to use
the little girls' room.

1318
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:44,283
Yes, my darling.
You know where it is,
don't you?

1319
01:11:44,316 --> 01:11:47,917
Uh, yes. It's, uh,
straight past Mimar Sinan

1320
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:49,316
and a right at Timur.

1321
01:11:50,817 --> 01:11:52,084
She's funny, isn't she?

1322
01:11:52,117 --> 01:11:53,850
She's great.
You're very lucky.

1323
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:55,750
Right. So, roof comes down.

1324
01:11:55,784 --> 01:11:58,616
Watch this. Roof comes down.

1325
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:02,716
You say,
"Relax. Relax, Mr. Steak."
There he is all calm now.

1326
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:10,616
<i>Sarah, regrettably,</i>
<i>Ben Harris has passed away.</i>

1327
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:12,216
When?
<i>Couple of hours ago.</i>

1328
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,817
<i>Orson encouraged him to jump off</i>
<i>an extremely tall building.</i>

1329
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,184
Mmm. Poor guy.

1330
01:12:16,216 --> 01:12:17,950
<i>Can you make him</i>
<i>sound like Harris?</i>

1331
01:12:17,984 --> 01:12:21,017
-Have you sourced
any existing voice recordings?
<i>-Yes.</i>

1332
01:12:21,051 --> 01:12:24,184
<i>In which case,</i>
<i>upload them and send them to me,</i>
<i>and I can do that.</i>

1333
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:25,850
<i>How?</i>

1334
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:27,750
The vocoder works
in real time.
<i>Mmm. Clever.</i>

1335
01:12:27,784 --> 01:12:30,084
That's AI for you,
Nathan.
<i>One last thing.</i>

1336
01:12:30,117 --> 01:12:33,616
<i>I need you to confirm</i>
<i>you still have full access</i>
<i>to Alexander's network.</i>

1337
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:37,017
<i>Confirmed.</i>

1338
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:42,950
Make yourself comfortable.
There is water in the door.

1339
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:10,283
- So far, so good.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1340
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:13,084
Keep in touch, JJ.

1341
01:13:13,117 --> 01:13:15,650
Now, you two, you're gonna
have to entertain yourselves
for an hour,

1342
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,717
'cause I've gotta
make a work call.

1343
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,051
It's all right.
I guess I could use a little
nappy-poo myself, so...

1344
01:13:20,084 --> 01:13:23,017
-Ooh. I'll join you
for your nappy-poo.
-Yeah?

1345
01:13:23,051 --> 01:13:24,784
Change of plan.

1346
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,283
Danny, you make the work call.
I'll take the nappy-poo.

1347
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:28,750
Michaela, you join me.

1348
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,117
Greggy.

1349
01:13:36,216 --> 01:13:38,950
They're going off road.
I'm parking up.

1350
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,316
He is the real deal.
It's super impressive.

1351
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:07,683
- And he's so into you!
<i>- You really</i> <i>know your stuff.</i>

1352
01:14:07,717 --> 01:14:09,850
I mean,
if you're not interested,
I know I might be.

1353
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:11,850
Fill your boots.

1354
01:14:11,884 --> 01:14:14,051
<i>Where's the paradox?</i>
What are you doing?

1355
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:17,984
-Well, I need to make Orson
sound like Greg's lawyer.
-Why?

1356
01:14:18,017 --> 01:14:21,183
Because Ben Harris is dead,
and we need him alive
for the arms deal.

1357
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:22,850
Ben Harris is dead?

1358
01:14:22,884 --> 01:14:24,650
When did that happen?
And who killed him?

1359
01:14:24,683 --> 01:14:26,784
That's not something
you need to worry about,
Danny.

1360
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:28,950
You need to worry about
how much longer we have
until we're found out.

1361
01:14:28,984 --> 01:14:31,884
Found out?

1362
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:35,051
I know you're having
a billionaire love affair.
It's very sweet.

1363
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:38,750
But we have about 20 minutes
before Greg's security
blows our fucking brains out.

1364
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:42,884
What do I do?

1365
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:45,116
I suggest you get ready
for your next scene.

1366
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,717
-Which is?
-The getaway.

1367
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,183
Right. I know
how to do that.

1368
01:14:50,216 --> 01:14:52,250
-Action time.
-Right.

1369
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:55,216
I'll see you in the garage.
- Okay, darling.

1370
01:15:15,683 --> 01:15:17,050
They will be here soon.

1371
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:27,850
I'm on.

1372
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:08,116
Sergi.
Boss.

1373
01:16:11,683 --> 01:16:13,083
<i>I'm in place.</i>

1374
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:16,050
Mr. Harris, I assume.

1375
01:16:18,717 --> 01:16:19,983
Pleasure to meet you.

1376
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,817
Likewise.

1377
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,250
Here we are.

1378
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:33,949
<i>Your people have confirmed</i>
<i>our product is authentic.</i>

1379
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:35,884
<i>I present the Handle.</i>

1380
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:39,083
I need my phone.

1381
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,016
Yes, Benjamin Bunny?

1382
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:55,917
Mr. Simmonds, we're connected.

1383
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:57,983
<i>Mr. Simmonds, we're connected.</i>

1384
01:16:58,617 --> 01:16:59,717
All right.

1385
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:00,884
We're good.

1386
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:08,683
The 15-digit passcode.

1387
01:17:10,617 --> 01:17:12,016
A moment of privacy, please.

1388
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,717
<i>A moment of privacy, please.</i>

1389
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,817
Emilia.
What is it?

1390
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:20,083
There seems to be
some sort of break-in
in our Internet security.

1391
01:17:20,116 --> 01:17:22,083
<i>Just waiting</i>
<i>for the system to go online.</i>

1392

<i>Just waiting</i>
<i>for the system to go online.</i>

1393
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,216
Holding.

1394
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:30,916
It's like someone's
hacked in, but it keeps
dropping in and out.

1395
01:17:30,949 --> 01:17:33,016
Who's hacking in?

1396
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:35,116
The signal's coming
from within the compound.

1397
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,116
Ready for
the 15-digit passcode.

1398
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:39,083
<i>Ready for the 15-digit passcode.</i>

1399
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:40,850
Right, here we go.

1400
01:17:41,784 --> 01:17:44,717
Two, six, two...

1401
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,949
<i>Harris is</i>
<i>transferring now. Stand by.</i>

1402
01:17:47,983 --> 01:17:49,183

1403
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,983
It's happening.

1404
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,116
Check the monitors.
Show me where.

1405
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,916
The signal's bouncing
all around the server.
I can't lock it down.

1406
01:17:56,949 --> 01:17:59,550
<i>...squiggly dash, eight...</i>

1412
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:21,216
It happened.

1413
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:23,116
<i>Ponytail, 11 o'clock.</i>

1414
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:26,150
Show me Greg's office.

1415
01:18:26,183 --> 01:18:28,116
I know Greg's in there.
Why is it empty?

1416
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:29,750
- Got it?
<i>- All done.</i>

1417
01:18:29,784 --> 01:18:31,916
- Transaction complete.
<i>- All right, Ben.</i>

1418
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:34,150
You hurry home.
Don't talk to strangers.

1419
01:18:37,316 --> 01:18:41,717
Check all communications
in and out of the villa
in the past 24 hours.

1420
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,583
<i>Doesn't like ya.</i>

1421
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:45,650
<i>It's the guard from the villa.</i>

1422
01:18:45,683 --> 01:18:47,083
I'm on him.

1423
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:49,116
Payment confirmed.

1424
01:18:50,983 --> 01:18:54,816
Ten billion confirmed.

1425
01:18:54,849 --> 01:18:56,083

1430
01:19:05,683 --> 01:19:07,150
This is not Ben Harris.

1431
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:10,650
Kill him!

1432
01:19:11,683 --> 01:19:12,717
JJ.

1433
01:19:38,216 --> 01:19:39,849
<i>Sarah, update.</i>

1434
01:19:39,883 --> 01:19:42,216
I'm just unconfirming
their confirmation.

1435
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:44,949
-What's happening?
-It was confirmed.

1436
01:19:44,983 --> 01:19:46,116
Just confirm again!

1437
01:20:00,116 --> 01:20:01,983
JJ, who are these people?

1438
01:20:02,016 --> 01:20:03,617
<i>I'm scanning.</i>
Find out.

What don't you understand?

1441
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,251
It's gone.

1442
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,683
Just don't tell me it's Mike.

1443
01:20:27,716 --> 01:20:30,116
<i>Understood. Then I won't.</i>

1444
01:20:31,016 --> 01:20:33,251
-Who is it?
-I'm not allowed to tell ya.

1445
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:35,284
Fuck it!

1446
01:20:36,317 --> 01:20:37,883
Give me a fucking break.

1447
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,116
I got Orson under control.

1448
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,849
Get that gun out of my face.

1449
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:42,716
Give me the fucking radio.

1450
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:44,550
Are you up there
in the chopper, Mike?

1451
01:20:45,351 --> 01:20:47,284
Orson, you sound upset.

1452
01:20:47,317 --> 01:20:50,351
Don't you worry
about me, Mike.
I'm having a lovely time.

1453
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:53,050
What seems to be the problem?
Engine trouble?

1454
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:56,816
<i>Don't concern yourself.</i>
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>the bus fare home.</i>

1455
01:20:56,849 --> 01:20:58,650
My boys

1456
01:21:04,716 --> 01:21:05,983
Come on.

1457
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:10,050
Who are ya?

1458
01:21:13,016 --> 01:21:14,317
Who are you, Michaela?

1459
01:21:17,284 --> 01:21:18,682
How'd you do it?

1460
01:21:20,783 --> 01:21:22,650
This thing between us...

1461
01:21:23,949 --> 01:21:25,116
is strong, innit?

1462
01:21:25,983 --> 01:21:27,983
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what the Turks call it?</i>

1463
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,351
It means "fire."

1464
01:21:32,384 --> 01:21:34,883
<i>They say the gods</i>
<i>will be furious</i>
<i>if you put it out.</i>

1465
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,184
<i>But you know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do?</i>

1466
01:21:37,217 --> 01:21:40,883
I'm going to put it out,
Michaela, because of Danny.

1467
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:43,116
He's a friend,
and I respect him.

1468
01:21:43,151 --> 01:21:45,749
And it's the right thing
to do.
Mmm.

1469
01:21:46,849 --> 01:21:48,317
I'm sorry
if that disappoints you.

1470
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:53,083
- No, it's fine.
- I'll see you at dinner.

1471
01:22:02,016 --> 01:22:03,983
Round up any survivors.

1472
01:22:04,016 --> 01:22:06,317
Tie 'em up, beat 'em up,
bring 'em here.

1473
01:22:06,351 --> 01:22:08,682
I wanna be
back in the air ASAP.

1474
01:22:11,783 --> 01:22:13,351
<i>Orson,</i>
<i>you know why I'm here.</i>

1475
01:22:13,384 --> 01:22:16,117
Let's not
make this any messier
than it needs to be.

1476
01:22:16,151 --> 01:22:17,682
So don't be a bad girl.

1477
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:18,916
<i>Just surrender my prize.</i>

1478
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:20,583
You want it so bad,

1479
01:22:20,616 --> 01:22:22,649
you get your arse down here
and get it yourself.

1480
01:22:24,883 --> 01:22:26,583
I have people
to do that for me.

1481
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:27,816
Oh, here he is.

1482
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:30,151
Keeping a safe distance
as usual.

1483
01:22:30,184 --> 01:22:32,251
You're a spineless jellyfish,
Mike.

1484
01:22:32,284 --> 01:22:35,117
- Yatom, get the case.
- I'm on it.

1485
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:37,284
Go on. It's yours.

1486
01:22:37,317 --> 01:22:39,949
You're not taking it.
I'm giving it to ya.

1487
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,816
Okay. What's this?

1488
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,949
Oh, no. He's got a gun.
It's okay, relax. Relax.

1489
01:22:53,716 --> 01:22:55,151
Oh, it's a selfie! Okay!

1490
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:57,716
Who's gonna tell me
what's going on?

1491
01:22:57,749 --> 01:22:59,351
We think they hacked
into our secure server.

1492
01:22:59,384 --> 01:23:01,117
It's not that secure,
then, is it?

1493
01:23:01,151 --> 01:23:03,084
It's worse than that,
I'm afraid.

1494
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:06,284
Whoever you think you were
on the phone to before,
you weren't.

1495
01:23:06,317 --> 01:23:08,151
<i>Ready for</i>
<i>the 15-digit passcode.</i>

That's Ben.

1497
01:23:10,384 --> 01:23:12,317
<i>Ready for</i>
<i>the 15-digit passcode.</i>

1498
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:15,749
You stop Danny Francesco
and whoever the fuck that is.

1499
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:17,084
Do it now. Do it now!

1500
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,749
Get after that car.

1501
01:23:18,783 --> 01:23:20,749
Bring them back to me.
<i>Understood.</i>

1502
01:23:29,716 --> 01:23:32,849
Yatom, we good?
Yes. We got it.

1503
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:34,783
Check the case, John.

1504
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:44,351
You have the case.
So why are we on our knees?

1505
01:23:44,384 --> 01:23:46,582
You won't be on your knees
for long, my friend.

1506
01:23:46,616 --> 01:23:51,051
Orson,
there's something strange
going on up here.

1507
01:23:52,017 --> 01:23:54,251
-It's good, boss.
-Right.

1508
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:08,916
Temperature's changed.

1509
01:24:08,949 --> 01:24:12,084
<i>Mike's gone rogue.</i>
<i>He's executed Alexander's men.</i>

1510
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,251
We've got what we need.
Connors.

1511
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:17,849
Yes, boss?

1512
01:24:18,317 --> 01:24:19,549
Kill Orson.

1513
01:24:21,716 --> 01:24:22,849
They're gonna kill you now.

1514
01:24:22,883 --> 01:24:24,716
Shoot them first, then.

1515
01:24:34,117 --> 01:24:35,682
I'm not just good with dogs.

1516
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:40,984
Tidy.

1517
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:44,151
There's a chopper
with a dead pilot up here.

1518
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:46,217
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>
Incoming.

1519
01:24:46,251 --> 01:24:48,017
<i>Nathan.</i>
Yes?

1520
01:24:48,051 --> 01:24:50,251
<i>Nathan, we're being chased</i>
<i>by Greg's security.</i>

1521
01:24:50,284 --> 01:24:51,916
Then get un-chased.

1522
01:24:55,051 --> 01:24:56,950
Good news,
the back is bulletproof.

1523
01:24:56,984 --> 01:24:59,051
Bad news,
I can't control the back end.

1524
01:25:06,783 --> 01:25:08,849
You any good
in one of these?

1525
01:25:08,883 --> 01:25:12,217
It's been a while.
But I'll feel my way.

1526
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:15,051
It's only a chopper.

1527
01:25:18,849 --> 01:25:21,151
Feeling my way.

1528
01:25:30,184 --> 01:25:32,184
You think you can
put your foot down?

1529
01:25:38,284 --> 01:25:39,984
What are you gonna do
with that?

1530
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:42,251
I'm gonna shoot at them,
Danny.

1531
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:43,816
I think I can
help you out with that.

1532
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:01,549
I'm out of bullets.

1533
01:26:03,184 --> 01:26:05,251
<i>Nathan, are you there?</i>
Yes, what is it?

1534
01:26:05,284 --> 01:26:08,317
Your friend Mike's
appeared again,
but this time he's turned.

1535
01:26:08,351 --> 01:26:11,984
<i>-Turned?</i>
<i>-He's executed Alexander's men</i>
<i>and taken the AI.</i>

1536
01:26:12,017 --> 01:26:13,716
I'm going after him
in a chopper.

1537
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:21,616
<i>Did the other two</i>
<i>get out okay?</i>

1538
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:23,783
Don't worry about them.
They can take care
of themselves.

1539
01:26:25,716 --> 01:26:27,217
The road's closed.

1540
01:26:36,716 --> 01:26:38,317
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>- Cover's blown.</i>

1541
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:40,350
Greg's security
are in pursuit.

1542
01:26:40,383 --> 01:26:42,350
You just focus
on retrieving the case
from Mike.

1543
01:26:42,383 --> 01:26:45,317
Find out where they are.
Already on it.

1544
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:47,749
Two minutes southwest
of this thing.

1545
01:26:52,383 --> 01:26:53,816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1546
01:27:12,783 --> 01:27:14,017
They're going in the tunnel.

1547
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,817
Do you know how to use
these rocket launchers?

1548
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:26,184
Can't be too complicated.

1549
01:27:26,884 --> 01:27:29,682
F for "forward,"
R for "rocket."

1550
01:27:31,051 --> 01:27:32,817
Oh, I think
we're in trouble here.

1551
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,850
Oops.

1552
01:27:45,817 --> 01:27:47,316
I think R's for "rear."

1553
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:50,682
I think
I've worked that out now.
Thank you, JJ.

1554
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:53,649
Let's hope
there's two more seats
in that chopper.

1555
01:28:01,784 --> 01:28:04,682
Knighton has confirmed
Mike was not working
for any government.

1556
01:28:04,716 --> 01:28:06,084
He's been working
independently.

1557
01:28:06,117 --> 01:28:08,084
Ain't that a surprise.

1558
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,984
<i>You need to track him down.</i>

1559
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:12,984
You track him down.
We're going back to Greg's.

1560
01:28:13,017 --> 01:28:14,582
-We are?
-You are?

1561
01:28:14,616 --> 01:28:16,084
We are?
We are?

1562
01:28:16,117 --> 01:28:18,616
I can't go back to Greg's.

1563
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:20,950
Danny, nothing
to worry about.

1564
01:28:20,984 --> 01:28:23,984
JJ's taking care of you.
Sit down, Danny.

1565
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:26,950
You might wanna see Greg,
but I don't think Greg
wants to see you.

1566
01:28:26,984 --> 01:28:30,750
That's where you're wrong,
Nathan. I am exactly
who he wants to see.

1567
01:28:30,784 --> 01:28:34,117
He knows Sarah downloaded
enough information on him
to throw away the key.

1568
01:28:34,151 --> 01:28:37,184
...find some evidence
we can hold over him
for a rainy day.

1569
01:28:37,217 --> 01:28:40,350
- So, Greg now works for us.
- Clever me.
I'm just gonna say it.

1570
01:28:40,383 --> 01:28:42,582
JJ, tell Greg
we're coming in.

1571
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,216
We have an offer
he can't refuse.

1572
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,117
We'll be expecting a call.

1573
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:47,616
Whatever you say, boss.

1574
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:50,682
Uh, can we--
can we drop me off first?

1575
01:28:51,682 --> 01:28:54,582
Nothing to worry about, Danny.
Greg's in love with you.

1576
01:28:54,616 --> 01:28:56,784
Would you buckle up?
Sit down, Danny.

1577
01:29:30,051 --> 01:29:33,717
Well, if you're wondering
whether I'm feeling
something of a tit,

1578
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,616
the answer is yes, I am.

1579
01:29:36,649 --> 01:29:39,250
-Is it humiliating, Emilia?
-Yes.

1580
01:29:39,283 --> 01:29:41,717
Do we still think
we can maybe make a deal?

1581
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,216
Yes.
Yes, we do.

1582
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,151
Which is not to take away

1583
01:29:45,183 --> 01:29:48,817
from the genius of your plan,
Orson Fortune.

1584
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,283
That is a sexy name.
It is.

1585
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:54,084
You must fancy him a bit,
fake Michaela.

1586
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:57,650
Still fancy you a bit.

1587
01:29:59,084 --> 01:30:03,582
But what you done,
using him as bait,

1588
01:30:03,616 --> 01:30:05,750
celebrity Trojan horse,
that's brilliant.

1589
01:30:05,784 --> 01:30:07,117
It's classy.

1590
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:11,350
Not so classy, though,
is your competitor Mike.

1591
01:30:11,383 --> 01:30:15,183
Comes barreling in,
pretending to be
Mr. Law and Order,

1592
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:19,984
steals your thunder and,
potentially, my commission.

1593
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:24,017
You can keep
your commission, Gregory.

1594
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,582
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1595
01:30:26,616 --> 01:30:31,150
You can keep your commission,
you can keep your reputation,
your liberty.

1596
01:30:31,183 --> 01:30:33,717
Because you're gonna donate
your said commission

1597
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,984
to your favorite charity,
Orphans of War.

1598
01:30:39,084 --> 01:30:41,216
Oh. Am I?

1599
01:30:41,817 --> 01:30:43,582
Who's your buyer, Greg?

1600
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,784
I never reveal my buyers,
Orson.

1601
01:30:49,084 --> 01:30:50,717
Emilia, tell them.

1602
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,216
You remember
Trent and Arnold?

1603
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:55,817
...would you care to meet
Trent and Arnold...

1604
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,183
- The biotech billionaire friends.
-  That's it.

1605
01:30:58,216 --> 01:31:03,283
As we speak, they are using
your precious programmable AI,

1606
01:31:03,316 --> 01:31:06,216
the Handle,
I believe you call it,

1607
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,817
in conjunction
with a concert of satellites.

1608
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:11,850
...enjoying the view
from up here.

1609
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:15,784
Purpose: To trip up
the world's banking system.

1610
01:31:15,817 --> 01:31:18,717
So that's why they're
buying up 40 billion dollars'
worth of gold

1611
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:22,017
while simultaneously trying
to cover their tracks.

1612
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:23,150
That's exactly it, Orson.

1613
01:31:23,183 --> 01:31:25,150
By the time they finish,

1614
01:31:25,183 --> 01:31:27,350
gold is the only thing
you'll be able to buy
a sticky book with.

1615
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:29,216
You're taking us there, Greg.

1616
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,717
I could.

1617
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,583
And I reckon
I can get through the door

1618
01:31:32,617 --> 01:31:35,283
because I've got something
they can't ignore.

1619
01:31:35,316 --> 01:31:38,316
Namely, a comprehensive
insurance policy.

1620
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:41,316
But I do worry about
your invitation.

1621
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:43,350
Trent and Arnold
have rented themselves

1622
01:31:43,383 --> 01:31:45,116
a very nasty
little private army.

1623
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:47,150
You let me worry about that.

1624
01:31:47,183 --> 01:31:49,817
Just one last thing.

1625
01:31:52,683 --> 01:31:55,583
I would kill
to see you in action.

1626
01:31:57,884 --> 01:31:59,083
Oh, Danny.

1627
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:01,884
Well, how can I say no?

1628
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:14,050
So, what are they going to do
with this Handle?

1629
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:15,283
The Handle...

1630
01:32:16,617 --> 01:32:18,884
would be
a financial atomic bomb.

1631
01:32:18,917 --> 01:32:22,250
<i>It'll create a digital glitch</i>
<i>in the world's banking system.</i>

1632
01:32:22,283 --> 01:32:24,717
<i>May last only a few minutes,</i>

1633
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:28,150
<i>but that'll be enough</i>
<i>for trust to evaporate</i>
<i>in conventional markets.</i>

1634
01:32:28,183 --> 01:32:31,917
Gold, like always,

1635
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:35,750
would be the only
remaining currency
with any credibility,

1636
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:38,283
<i>its value</i>
<i>rising exponentially.</i>

1637
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:43,083
Anarchy would follow
while the world
reorganizes itself.

1638
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:46,183
Well, Nathan,

1639
01:32:46,216 --> 01:32:49,116
now it's time for your man
to prove his worth.

1640
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,617
Clear the room.

1641
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,150
Anita.
Yes, Mr. Knighton.

1642
01:32:58,183 --> 01:33:00,316
Get the PM on the line.

1643
01:33:10,283 --> 01:33:13,917
And the bird is up.
We'll have eyes soon.

1644
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:20,183
And Greg and Danny
have arrived.

1645
01:33:24,817 --> 01:33:26,784
Floor is yours.

1646
01:33:26,817 --> 01:33:29,150
Method?
Blitzkrieg.

1647
01:33:29,183 --> 01:33:31,617
Hmm.
Get 'em before
they count the first body.

1648
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:32,917
I like it.

1649
01:33:33,683 --> 01:33:36,949
I'll cover ya.
There are blind spots.

1650
01:33:36,983 --> 01:33:38,983
That's what the bird's for,
JJ.

1651
01:33:39,016 --> 01:33:40,216
JJ...

1652
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,650
shoot straight.

1653
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:49,750
Leave it with me, boss.

1654
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,550
How are you feeling?

1655
01:34:10,617 --> 01:34:12,116
Good.
Nervous?

1656
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:14,050
No.

1657
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,784
Remember your lines.
You've only got two.

1658
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,283
<i>You got the bit</i>
<i>about the lights?</i>

1659
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:25,050
Yes.

1660
01:34:25,883 --> 01:34:27,183
One more thing, Danny.

1661
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,050
Lose the shades.

1662
01:34:36,183 --> 01:34:40,583
And we are back
with four guards
by the pagoda.

1663
01:34:40,617 --> 01:34:42,650
I am blocking their comms.

1664
01:34:43,283 --> 01:34:44,617
Blocked.

1665
01:34:45,717 --> 01:34:47,583
I have the two on the right.

1666
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:02,283
Hello, boys. Hello.

1667
01:35:02,316 --> 01:35:05,784
Ooh, a lot of very
serious faces, Danny.

1668
01:35:05,817 --> 01:35:08,283
Now, you remember those two,
don't you? Trent and Arnold.

1669
01:35:08,316 --> 01:35:12,316
And one of you, you,
is Mike. Is that right?

1670
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,183
Well played, Mike.

1671
01:35:14,216 --> 01:35:16,316
A bit naughty
for a government contractor,

1672
01:35:16,351 --> 01:35:18,250
<i>but we are where we are.</i>

1673
01:35:18,283 --> 01:35:19,849
Moving on.

1674
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,550
Two more ahead.
I'll take one o'clock.

1675
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,849
The purpose
of this visit is, Danny?

1676
01:35:37,317 --> 01:35:41,016
You never paid, uh...
Mr. Simmonds's commission.

1677
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,016
We were paying
for you to deliver,
but you didn't.

1678
01:35:44,518 --> 01:35:47,183
Mike did. You failed.

1679
01:35:47,216 --> 01:35:50,183
That's a bit weak,
isn't it, Trent? Because
I wasn't paid to deliver.

1680
01:35:50,216 --> 01:35:53,317
I was paid to supply,
and I think I have supplied.
Have I, Danny?

1681
01:35:53,351 --> 01:35:55,050
<i>Orson, take a left</i>
<i>through the hedges.</i>

1682
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,983
Two on the jetty.

1683
01:36:00,116 --> 01:36:01,783
Now you're clear.

1684
01:36:07,983 --> 01:36:09,650
Do we really
have to listen to this?

1685
01:36:09,683 --> 01:36:12,284
You will listen to this,
and here's the reason.

1686
01:36:12,317 --> 01:36:16,083
I don't wanna patronize you.
I'm not a patronizing person.

1687
01:36:16,116 --> 01:36:19,183
But you three,
one, two, three,

1688
01:36:19,216 --> 01:36:21,617
you are quite new
to this game, aren't you?

1689
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,351
And there is a reason
why no one,
and I do mean no one,

1690
01:36:25,384 --> 01:36:28,150
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Qaddafi,

1691
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:29,750
not Mr. Escobar--

1692
01:36:29,783 --> 01:36:31,983
and that's before
I start dropping names...

1693
01:36:32,016 --> 01:36:35,949
...why none of them
have ever refused to pay me.

1694
01:36:35,983 --> 01:36:38,016
<i>Have you got me?</i>
Going dark.

1695
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:39,717
Repositioning.
Let me find you.

1696
01:36:39,749 --> 01:36:40,783
In the Can-Am.

1697
01:36:41,916 --> 01:36:43,351
<i>Behind me, on the horizon,</i>

1698
01:36:43,384 --> 01:36:46,916
I think you'll see an old,
derelict, 1960s hotel.

1699
01:36:46,949 --> 01:36:50,050
<i>Needs demolition.</i>
<i>Now, you could do that with...</i>

1700
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:53,749
I don't know, what,
30, 40 pounds of Semtex.
About right, Mike?

1701
01:36:56,317 --> 01:36:57,983
<i>Silence</i>
<i>and darkness retained.</i>

1702
01:36:58,016 --> 01:36:59,949
And you've got
two more guards up top.

1703
01:37:01,284 --> 01:37:04,116
Or you could do it with...
Lights, please, Danny.

1704
01:37:05,116 --> 01:37:11,617
One AGM-65 Maverick missile
very much like this one

1705
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:13,683
in three, two, one.

1706
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:19,583
What happened there then?

1707
01:37:20,116 --> 01:37:21,583
Let's do that again.

1708
01:37:22,116 --> 01:37:25,617
In three, two, one.

1709
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:32,749
Wait. Wait. Wait.
There's more.

1710
01:37:46,816 --> 01:37:48,650
There we are.
I think we're done now.

1711
01:37:50,016 --> 01:37:51,849
Danny, the lights again,
please.

1712
01:37:54,816 --> 01:37:59,317
What are you trying to convey
with this... illustration,
Mr. Simmonds?

1713
01:37:59,351 --> 01:38:04,184
What I'm trying to convey,
Mike, is how little
you boys understand

1714
01:38:04,217 --> 01:38:07,583
of the new world
which you find yourselves in.

1715
01:38:07,617 --> 01:38:09,251
I would've thought
it was obvious

1716
01:38:09,284 --> 01:38:11,783
that I'd have some kind
of insurance, and I do.

1717
01:38:11,816 --> 01:38:13,217
Danny, give them the papers.

1718
01:38:17,384 --> 01:38:19,849
You'll see
in the left-hand column

1719
01:38:19,883 --> 01:38:22,184
there's a list
of names and addresses

1720
01:38:22,217 --> 01:38:24,816
of people that I believe
you hold near and dear.

1721
01:38:24,849 --> 01:38:27,116
<i>Take the service elevator</i>
<i>one level down.</i>

1722
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:29,682
And he's in. Phase two.
Let's move.

1723
01:38:29,716 --> 01:38:31,649
In the right-hand column,

1724
01:38:31,682 --> 01:38:35,151
there's a very exact time
for when those people
will be, um...

1725
01:38:35,184 --> 01:38:37,284
What's a nice word for it,
Danny?

1726
01:38:37,317 --> 01:38:39,949
Uh, "eviscerated."

1727
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:41,649
That's not
a very nice word, is it?

1728
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:44,317
<i>But it's not gonna happen,</i>

1729
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:48,749
because I'm very confident
that within five minutes,

1730
01:38:48,783 --> 01:38:52,317
and five minutes is all you have
as the countdown has started,

1731
01:38:52,351 --> 01:38:54,184
and the only thing
that will stop it...

1732
01:39:00,949 --> 01:39:03,217
...is a phone call
from my business manager...

1733
01:39:05,117 --> 01:39:06,783
telling me that my money

1734
01:39:08,251 --> 01:39:11,184
has been transferred
to my account.

1735
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:24,284
<i>So from this point,</i>
<i>it's out of my hands</i>
<i>and into yours.</i>

1736
01:39:24,317 --> 01:39:27,716
Danny, let's go
and have a drink. Come on.

1737
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:32,582
Bye, boys.

1738
01:39:34,384 --> 01:39:36,084
I mean,
give him the money.

1739
01:39:36,117 --> 01:39:38,783
Mike. That's my mom there.

1740
01:39:39,949 --> 01:39:41,050
Jean.

1741
01:39:43,649 --> 01:39:46,016
That's the most
impressive thing
I've ever seen a man do.

1742
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:48,284
Really? Really?

1743
01:39:48,317 --> 01:39:50,217
Get the transfer done now.

1744
01:39:50,251 --> 01:39:52,649
-We were set up
to make the payment anyway.
-So get it done now!

1745
01:39:59,816 --> 01:40:01,251
He's bluffing.

1746
01:40:01,284 --> 01:40:03,849
Those explosions didn't
look like a bluff to me!

1747
01:40:03,883 --> 01:40:07,184
Turns out there's a reason
they call him the Dark Angel
of Merciless Death, Mike!

1748
01:40:21,284 --> 01:40:24,016
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>He's bluffing.</i>
<i>Easy for you to say.</i>

1749
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:26,117
I mean, do you even have
anyone on your list?

1750
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:28,983
You can forget your commission, Mike.
 It's going to Simmonds.

1751
01:40:29,017 --> 01:40:32,616
You useless
pair of Silicon tits.
Let me handle this.

1752
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:34,682
Back off! All right?

1753
01:40:34,716 --> 01:40:36,217
You handling it
put us in this mess.

1754
01:40:36,251 --> 01:40:39,051
I'm not interested
in what you have to say, Mike.

1755
01:40:39,084 --> 01:40:41,051
Now back the fuck off!

1756
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:51,616
Backing off.

1757
01:40:53,682 --> 01:40:54,883
Backing off.

1758
01:40:56,849 --> 01:40:59,184
Everybody calm down.
Calm down.

1759
01:40:59,217 --> 01:41:01,051
Mike looks upset.

1760
01:41:01,084 --> 01:41:03,949
-Orson, how you doing?
-Still alive.
Still moving upwards.

1761
01:41:03,984 --> 01:41:06,117
Okay, well, Greg left
with the movie star.

1762
01:41:06,151 --> 01:41:07,984
It seems like things
are getting a bit heated
in there.

1763
01:41:08,017 --> 01:41:10,317
Chris, progress report.

1764
01:41:10,351 --> 01:41:12,582
It's happening, it's happening.
Thirty seconds.

1765
01:41:13,384 --> 01:41:15,051
They're doing
the transferring now.

1766
01:41:15,084 --> 01:41:17,117
That's a billion dollars
to your Orphans of War.

1767
01:41:17,151 --> 01:41:19,716
Look, we'll be okay.
We won't be okay.

1768
01:41:19,749 --> 01:41:22,351
Did you see
what happened out there?
You think that's okay?

1769
01:41:22,384 --> 01:41:26,184
I am in their system.
I have all their
codes and details.

1770
01:41:26,217 --> 01:41:28,117
I can move all their money.

1771
01:41:28,151 --> 01:41:30,816
Truth is
I am better than them,

1772
01:41:30,849 --> 01:41:32,783
and you don't need them
anymore.

1773
01:41:32,816 --> 01:41:34,749
...idea to get
involved with the fucking
weapons dealers--

1774
01:41:34,783 --> 01:41:36,117
Don't turn this around on me.

1775
01:41:36,151 --> 01:41:38,184
We have a problem,
and we have to deal with it.

1776
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,217
-There are explosions going off
on the fucking horizon.
-Oh, are there?

1777
01:41:40,251 --> 01:41:42,582
You think that's fu--
So, you're just gonna
brush that off?

1778
01:41:42,616 --> 01:41:43,649
No, no. No. No!

1779
01:41:58,666 --> 01:42:00,234
Is it safe to go in?

1780
01:42:00,267 --> 01:42:01,733
It's hard to tell,

1781
01:42:01,766 --> 01:42:03,833
but there is nobody moving.

1782
01:42:20,001 --> 01:42:21,666
Bit of a mess in here,
whiz kid.

1783
01:42:28,167 --> 01:42:29,733
Found the case, JJ.

1784
01:42:33,967 --> 01:42:35,101
Just check it.

1785
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:39,967
We're good, boss.

1786
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:44,799
Orson, behind you.
In three, two, one.

1787
01:42:54,934 --> 01:42:56,666
Don't do it, Mike.

1788
01:42:57,599 --> 01:42:58,934
Leave it where it lies.

1789
01:43:04,766 --> 01:43:07,267
Orson, I need the case.

1790
01:43:07,301 --> 01:43:09,034
I need the fucking case!

1791
01:43:09,067 --> 01:43:12,632
You want it so bad, Mike,
you can fucking have it.

1792
01:43:12,666 --> 01:43:13,967
Orson!

1793
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:39,267
What you got in the case?
Our wages.

1794
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:42,001
Is that Nathan and his army
to get us out of here?

1795
01:43:42,034 --> 01:43:44,134
That's not Nathan
you can hear.

1796
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:48,632
That's Knighton's
black ops incoming,
a little bit late as usual.

1797
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:51,834
Nathan abandoned us.
Apparently, he has something
more important to do.

1798
01:43:51,867 --> 01:43:54,300
Of course he did.
He sent the BBJ.

1799
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:57,834
He's in Doha. Apparently,
there's been another incident.

1800
01:43:57,867 --> 01:44:00,001
Oh, but he told me
to tell you not to panic.

1801
01:44:00,034 --> 01:44:02,599
He has all of your
medicinal requirements
on board.

1802
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:04,666
Did you bring a corkscrew?

1803
01:44:04,699 --> 01:44:06,800
I'll be your corkscrew, baby.

1804
01:44:06,834 --> 01:44:08,067
Course you will.

1805
01:44:08,101 --> 01:44:10,266
Budge up.
We're going on a holiday.

1806
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:46,967
I suppose you're all feeling
quite pleased with yourselves.

1807
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:50,834
It's impossible to feel
pleased with ourselves
on the wages you pay.

1808
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:52,266
I have some good news.

1809
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:55,266
Since your last escapade
was such a success,

1810
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,934
don't let it go to your heads,

1811
01:44:56,967 --> 01:44:58,867
I have another job for you.

1812
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:01,900
And this time,
the money is spectacular.

1813
01:45:01,934 --> 01:45:04,566
I don't care
how spectacular it is.

1814
01:45:04,599 --> 01:45:06,666
I'm going on holiday.
That's yours.

1815
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,566
Ooh, where are we going,
darling?

1816
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:10,599
Don't know,
and I don't care.

1817
01:45:10,632 --> 01:45:13,532
As long as it's hot,
expensive, and he's paying.

1818
01:45:13,566 --> 01:45:15,001
And we're taking the jet.

1819
01:45:15,034 --> 01:45:17,666
Take it, take it.
Go wherever you want.
Go mad.

1820
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:19,632
Enjoy the snow,
enjoy the beaches.

1821
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:22,666
It's all on me, as long
as you're back in 36 hours.

1822
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:25,266
Two weeks.
Orson.

1823
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:26,934
I'm not great at skiing.
Orson.

1824
01:45:26,967 --> 01:45:28,632
I like the beach.

1825
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:30,101
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm drunk.

1826
01:45:30,134 --> 01:45:32,667
-Fine. 48 hours.
-Ten days.

1827
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:35,599
You're killing me!
Ninety-six hours!
A week.

1828
01:45:35,632 --> 01:45:40,067
And, Orson, we need
the necklaces and watches
you stole from Alexander.

1829
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:42,101
Your government
wants them back.

1830
01:45:42,809 --> 01:45:45,742
Too late. I've sold 'em.
I've invested the money.

1831
01:45:45,776 --> 01:45:48,509
We are now
in the movie business.

1832
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:50,908
See you next Tuesday.

1833
01:45:51,742 --> 01:45:52,941
Hold on.

1834
01:45:53,709 --> 01:45:57,609
Orson. Wait.
W-What movie business?

1835
01:45:57,642 --> 01:46:01,475
It better not involve
Danny Francesco
and his fiancé, Greg Simmonds.

1836
01:46:29,975 --> 01:46:32,742
We were paying to deliver,
but you didn't.

1837
01:46:32,775 --> 01:46:35,975
Mike did. You failed.

1838
01:46:36,008 --> 01:46:38,609
Yeah, well, that's
a bit naughty, Mr. Yamamoto.

1839
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:41,308
I'm not paid to deliver.
I'm paid to supply.

1840
01:46:43,241 --> 01:46:45,775
Now, there's a very
good reason why no one...

1841
01:46:45,808 --> 01:46:47,542
...and I mean no one,

1842
01:46:47,575 --> 01:46:50,908
not Mr. Hussein,
not Mr. Qaddafi,
not Mr. Escobar--

1843
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:53,241
and that's before
I start dropping names...

1844
01:46:53,275 --> 01:46:55,609
Behind me on the horizon,

1845
01:46:55,642 --> 01:46:59,542
there's a derelict monastery
in need of demolition.

1846
01:47:00,642 --> 01:47:02,442
Now, how are we going
to do that?

1847
01:47:02,475 --> 01:47:06,642
Well, we could use
50, 60 pounds of Semtex.

1848
01:47:06,676 --> 01:47:08,709
Does that sound about right,
Mr. Yamamoto?

1849
01:47:08,741 --> 01:47:15,207
Or we could use one single
AMG-65 Maverick missile,

1850
01:47:15,242 --> 01:47:17,575
very much like this.

1851
01:47:17,609 --> 01:47:20,908
Going in three, two, one.

1852
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:26,475
Fucking amateur hour. Maxie.

1853
01:47:26,509 --> 01:47:28,409
- Where's the VFX, Maxie?
- Sorry, Danny.

1854
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:30,808
Come on, man.
I can't work like this.
I'll get it fixed.

1855
01:47:30,841 --> 01:47:32,975
- Barney, can you get me Guy?
- Cut the camera.

1856
01:47:33,008 --> 01:47:34,709
Cut the cameras.
Reset, everybody.

1857
01:47:37,275 --> 01:47:39,676
What did you think
of that one, Greggy?

1858
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:41,542
I'll be honest with you.

1859
01:47:41,575 --> 01:47:44,908
For me,
that was very, very moving.

1860
01:47:44,941 --> 01:47:47,275
That was--
That was beautiful, Danny.

1861
01:47:47,308 --> 01:47:48,975
That one?
That one.

1862
01:47:49,008 --> 01:47:50,775
That one.
That one.

1863
01:47:50,808 --> 01:47:53,442
I don't know.
It was not my best take.
I don't...

1864
01:47:53,475 --> 01:47:55,308
Did you like that one?
I don't...

1865
01:47:55,342 --> 01:47:58,242
See, I love that bit
because you're--
you're smiling,

1866
01:47:58,275 --> 01:47:59,676
but you're scary too.

1867
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:03,275
Yeah. But look at my hair.
It's awful.

1868
01:48:03,308 --> 01:48:06,275
I just feel like it's--
There. And there, there.

1869
01:48:06,308 --> 01:48:08,609
Eh, I think
we can do another one.
Brilliant.

1870
01:48:08,642 --> 01:48:10,775
We can do another one. Guy!
Go on. Off you go.
