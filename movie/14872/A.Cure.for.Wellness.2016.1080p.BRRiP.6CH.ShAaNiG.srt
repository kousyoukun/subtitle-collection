1
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,599
Oh.

2
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,195
Son of a bitch!

3
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,719
No, we can't touch the munis.

4
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,977
We'll use them as collateral

5
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,601
for a leveraged
equity position in Cisco.

6
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:58,777
Then I want you
to take everything out of

7
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,937
First National and
move it over to Banyon.

8
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,577
Wait, you mean Delaware?
I thought that was dead.

9
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,601
That's resurrected.

10
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:03,777
We need to clean up
the Reynolds account...

11
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,761
in case those fucks at AML
decide to do their job.

12
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:06,956
Are you sure about this?

13
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,110
Nothing on email.

14
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,839
Move everything back on Monday.

15
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:11,561
You paying attention?

16
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:12,915
Yeah, yeah, I am.

17
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:14,673
Tickets?
I don't know if...

18
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,558
I'm sending the numbers
through now.

19
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:18,949
What about Green?

20
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,177
Uh, stall him.
I don't give a shit.

21
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,321
Call in sick if you have to.

22
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,754
Business or pleasure?

23
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,593
I don't know. I just...

24
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,876
Seriously?

25
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,721
Look, I don't know
if I feel comfortable...

26
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,076
Josh! Josh!
Stop being such a pussy.

27
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,709
Just do what I tell you to do,
and call me when it's done.

28
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,912
To my
fellow members of the board.

29
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,960
A man cannot unsee the truth.

30
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,510
He cannot willingly
return to darkness...

31
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:06,639
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...

32
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:10,275
any more than he can be unborn.

33
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,230
We are the only species
capable of self-reflection.

34
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,793
The only species
with the toxin of self-doubt

35
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,872
written into our genetic code.

36
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,637
Unequal to our gifts, we build,

37
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,633
we buy, we consume.

38
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,719
We wrap ourselves
in the illusion

39
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,393
of material success.

40
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,474
We cheat and deceive
as we claw our way...

41
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,872
to the pinnacle of what
we define as achievement.

42
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,473
Superiority to other men.

43
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,994
Corner office.

44
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,389
Who'd you have to blow?

45
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,598
I heard he closed
the Reynolds account.

46
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,234
How exactly did you do that?

47
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,595
Just that good, I guess.

48
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,280
Don't forget
about us little people.

49
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,915
Oh, how could I?

50
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,279
You know how I take my coffee.

51
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,993
Excuse me, but they wanna
see you upstairs

52
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:18,514
in the partners boardroom.

53
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,960
Tell them I'll be right there.

54
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:24,191
Oh, and tomorrow
is your mother's birthday.

55
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,039
Get her something for me,
would you?

56
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:27,600
Of course.

57
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,915
There is a sickness inside us.

58
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:35,836
Rising like the bile that leaves

59
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,752
that bitter taste
at the back of our throats.

60
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,512
It's there in every one of you
seated around the table.

61
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,275
We deny its existence
until one day

62
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,192
the body rebels
against the mind...

63
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,760
and screams out,

64
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:55,160
"I am not a well man."

65
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,270
No doubt you will think
only of the merger.

66
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:06,197
That unclean melding of two
equally diseased institutions.

67
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,833
But the truth cannot be ignored.

68
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,231
For only when
we know what ails us

69
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,391
can we hope to find the cure.

70
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:16,833
I will not return.

71
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,077
Do not attempt
to contact me again.

72
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,391
Sincerely, Roland E. Pembroke.

73
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,514
Well, Mr. Lockhart...

74
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,838
what do you make of that?

75
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,878
Clearly, he's lost his mind.

76
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,440
Our thoughts exactly.

77
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,791
Man goes for
a two-week spa vacation,

78
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,758
and has a complete
mental breakdown.

79
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:43,550
Who the hell takes the waters
in the 21st century anyway?

80
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:46,235
I trust you understand
the sensitivity

81
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,511
of some of the information
in that letter.

82
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,594
So it's true.

83
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,912
A merger of this kind
will make us...

84
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:54,721
one of the biggest
financial service firms

85
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:56,160
on the Eastern Seaboard.

86
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:58,915
Something that stands to
enrich everyone in this room.

87
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,236
Including you.

88
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:01,720
We hear good things.

89
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,679
Your work on the Reynolds
account was inspired.

90
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,236
Of course, the SEC will want

91
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,881
unfettered access to our books.

92
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,033
Any irregularities
are sure to come out.

93
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,595
You didn't really think
we wouldn't find out?

94
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,798
I don't know
what you're talking about.

95
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:29,473
You think there's a trick
you can pull we haven't tried?

96
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:33,475
This is amateur.

97
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,712
Can I ask you something,
Mr. Lockhart?

98
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,717
You ever have a 12-inch
black dick in your ass?

99
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:45,910
Prison, Mr. Lockhart.

100
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,400
You're in a lot of trouble.

101
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,035
If that were the case,

102
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,271
you would have
already turned me in.

103
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,996
So, my guess is the SEC

104
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,799
is after someone
a little more senior.

105
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:08,478
Someone on the board, perhaps.

106
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,633
Or someone
who's clearly unstable.

107
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:21,152
We'd like you
to go to Switzerland

108
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,277
and bring Mr. Pembroke
back to us.

109
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:24,476
You see...

110
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,672
the merger cannot go through

111
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:28,991
without Mr. Pembroke
signing off...

112
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:32,949
on certain legal matters.

113
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,349
I don't have the relationship

114
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,761
with Mr. Pembroke
that Morris had.

115
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:36,956
Fuck Morris.

116
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,097
Now, Morris was a good salesman,

117
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,156
dependable family man.

118
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,714
God rest his soul.

119
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,076
But he didn't have vision.

120
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,914
Someone has to
take responsibility.

121
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:31,994
Josh, it's me again.

122
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:33,761
In an hour and a half,
the Nikkei closes.

123
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:34,977
When it does,
I want you to empty Banyon

124
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,036
and buy puts in Glenco.

125
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,457
I'm sending
the details over now.

126
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,516
And fucking call me back.

127
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,672
I don't like leaving
messages like this.

128
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,033
You're here for the cure?

129
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,238
No, I'm just visiting.

130
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:52,750
You mind?

131
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,441
Go ahead.

132
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:02,437
You're younger
than most of my passengers.

133
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:05,871
Do a lot of driving
for the sanitarium?

134
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,315
All the driving.

135
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:09,876
Every week, I pick up
rich people from the train...

136
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,759
and take them up the mountain.

137
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,912
Only rich people, huh?

138
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,799
Must be expensive.

139
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:18,350
Well, wealthy people
have wealthy problems.

140
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,512
Me, I'm happy
with a simple life.

141
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,672
That's it? No ambition?

142
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,877
Just drive people
up and down the mountain?

143
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,193
Most people tend to stay.

144
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:29,636
Why's that?

145
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,074
I guess they like it there.

146
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,241
Oh, shit.

147
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,081
I don't go in for spas
and that kind of thing.

148
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:39,193
I work for a living,
like my father before me.

149
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:42,080
A son learns what it is to
be a man from his father.

150
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,310
Am I right?

151
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,435
I wouldn't know.

152
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,671
I didn't grow up with my father.

153
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,951
How long will you be gone?

154
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:55,873
Just a few days.
It's business.

155
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:58,958
You don't look well.

156
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,873
I'm fine. I just haven't been
sleeping much.

157
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,872
You need to rest.

158
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,594
You know, I always
told your father to rest...

159
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,710
but he wouldn't listen.

160
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,109
He was weak.

161
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,115
You didn't know him.

162
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,760
And whose fault is that?

163
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,594
So, are you happy here?

164
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,234
Are they taking
good care of you?

165
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:29,950
People come here to die.
Why would I be happy?

166
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:33,032
I'm getting a promotion.

167
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,280
So, when I get back

168
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,161
I'll be able to move you
to somewhere better.

169
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,317
Somewhere near the beach
or something.

170
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:42,349
You won't come back.

171
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,120
Of course I will.

172
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,194
Another ballerina?

173
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,198
She's not like the others.

174
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,635
Why's that?

175
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,911
She lives in a dream.

176
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,713
But she's dancing.

177
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:14,671
That's because she doesn't
know she's dreaming.

178
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,153
Friendly bunch.

179
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,596
Yeah.

180
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,358
There's always been bad blood

181
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,909
between the villagers
and the people on the hill.

182
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:47,401
Why's that?

183
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,275
History.

184
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,152
How old is this place?

185
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:27,596
Foundations date back
to the time of the barons.

186
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,356
For centuries, all this land
and everyone in it...

187
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:33,000
belonged to one family.

188
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:35,637
The Von Reichmerls.

189
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,314
What happened to them?

190
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:40,679
Hmm. Interesting story.

191
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,838
Apparently, the last baron

192
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:46,754
was so obsessed with
the purity of his bloodline...

193
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,479
he decided only his sister

194
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,677
was clean enough
to carry his child.

195
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:54,833
When the church forbade
the union, he renounced God.

196
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,434
That must have gone over well.

197
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,556
No shit.

198
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,233
So on his wedding night...

199
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,959
the villagers
came up the hill...

200
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:06,111
chased the Baron and his bride
into the catacombs...

201
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,920
and made him watch
while they burned her alive.

202
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,311
Then they burned
the whole place to the ground.

203
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,631
That's a hell of a story.

204
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,310
Yeah.

205
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:25,879
But that was 200 years ago.

206
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,157
A lot's changed since then.

207
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,554
20 minutes max.

208
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,154
No hurry.

209
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,715
Welcome!

210
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:14,961
May I help you?

211
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:17,959
I'm here to see a guest.
Mr. Roland Pembroke.

212
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,161
I'm sorry, but visiting hours
are over for the day.

213
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,915
I've come a long way.

214
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,276
Maybe you could
make an exception.

215
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,079
There are no exceptions.

216
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:36,721
Is there a manager
I could speak to?

217
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,119
Sign here.

218
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,281
Please.

219
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:48,078
Thank you, Mr. Lockhart.

220
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,959
I'll see what I can do.

221
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,592
You won't get any service here.

222
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,080
Part of the treatment.

223
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:02,515
You get used to it.

224
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:05,320
What's a ten-letter word
for amnesty?

225
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,481
No idea.

226
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,756
Exemption.

227
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,713
Nope. That's only nine.

228
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,240
Absolution.

229
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,350
Yes!

230
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,319
You like puzzles?

231
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:18,921
Not really.

232
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:30,996
You mind?

233
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:00,481
Thank you.

234
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,636
I believe the reception nurse
explained...

235
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,998
that visiting hours end
at 3:00 p.m. precisely.

236
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,717
She did. But as I'm sure
you're aware...

237
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,553
Mr. Pembroke remains the CEO

238
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:26,438
of a major financial
institution.

239
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:28,789
Under the circumstances,

240
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,400
I was hoping you can make an...

241
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,354
exception.

242
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:35,921
Vitamins.

243
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,594
If we are to help the people
that come here...

244
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,792
we must keep up our strength.

245
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:45,998
May one ask
what it is concerning?

246
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:47,594
It's a business matter.

247
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:50,881
I'm not at liberty to say
any more than that.

248
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,191
Of course. And I hope
you understand

249
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:55,078
that we also have our rules.

250
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,550
Our treatments here
are most effective...

251
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,234
when exposure to the stresses

252
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,881
of the modern world
is strictly limited.

253
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,679
Director Volmer
is quite firm on that.

254
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,001
Hydrotherapy?

255
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:06,161
That is correct.

256
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,471
That's a long way to come
just for water.

257
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:12,471
The sanitarium is built
over an ancient aquifer...

258
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:16,520
that offers uniquely
rejuvenating qualities.

259
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,230
Rebuilt.

260
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:27,919
After the fire.

261
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:30,750
Yes.

262
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,271
History is full of darkness.

263
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:37,711
If you would like
to leave a note...

264
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:40,759
I'd happily pass it along
to Mr. Pembroke.

265
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:43,560
Mr. Pieterson?

266
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,199
I understand the work
you do here is important...

267
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:50,239
and you're obviously
a very busy man.

268
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:53,676
But if you wouldn't mind
finding time between

269
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,558
administering aqua aerobics
and Jacuzzis...

270
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,677
to inform Mr. Pembroke
he has a visitor...

271
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,157
with information of the utmost
urgency to him personally...

272
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,674
I'd be grateful.

273
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:06,497
On the other hand, if you
want me to write a note...

274
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,617
so you can slip it
under his door

275
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:08,681
with his breakfast tray...

276
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,040
on the off-chance
he notices it

277
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,281
before his morning rubdown...

278
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,199
I'm afraid
that's not gonna cut it.

279
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,750
You see, I just traveled
4,000 miles to get here.

280
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,777
There's a red-eye going back
to New York tonight...

281
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,520
and I intend Mr. Pembroke
and I to be on it.

282
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:28,118
You plan to take Mr. Pembroke
back to New York with you?

283
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:29,634
Is that a problem?

284
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:33,271
Of course, it is entirely
up to Mr. Pembroke.

285
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,399
He's a patient, not a prisoner.

286
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,196
He'll be in treatment
until after 7:00.

287
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,617
If you'd like to come back then,

288
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,869
I'll make sure he's available.

289
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:49,039
Thank you
for your understanding.

290
00:20:58,561 --> 00:20:59,914
Leaving already?

291
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,833
What a nice-looking
young man.

292
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,036
Where's your friend?

293
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,217
What time's the last train
to Zurich?

294
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:05,241
Not till 10:00.

295
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,277
Get me to a hotel.
I gotta make a call.

296
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:49,761
Pretty girl.

297
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:58,870
What the fuck!

298
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,232
How long will you be gone?

299
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,719
Just a few days.

300
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,992
Are we waiting for someone else?

301
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,512
There is no one else.

302
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,440
Sleep well?

303
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:13,841
Uh...

304
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,436
I can't remember
having slept better.

305
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,801
It's the mountain air.

306
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:25,756
Mr. Lockhart...

307
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,439
my name is Henrich Volmer.

308
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:31,432
I am the director
of the sanitarium here.

309
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,840
How long have I been here?

310
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,036
Three days.

311
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:36,790
Oh, Jesus!

312
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:42,277
You can count yourself lucky.
It was a clean break.

313
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,830
Although I do feel
partly responsible.

314
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,070
The locals tell me

315
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,497
I should hunt the deer
on the property...

316
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:48,556
but I can't bring myself

317
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:51,109
to harm the innocent creatures.

318
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,881
After all,
they were here long before us.

319
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,194
I need to call New York.

320
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,916
I took the liberty
of informing your office

321
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,071
of the accident,
if that's your concern.

322
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,152
They agreed with me...

323
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:07,916
that business can wait
and your health cannot.

324
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:10,716
Hank Green said that?

325
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:12,274
Even the acting head

326
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,033
of a major Wall Street
finance firm...

327
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:15,873
can't argue with
the consequences

328
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,992
of a serious car accident.

329
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,674
We don't get many visitors here.

330
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,832
Most of my patients have done
extraordinary things.

331
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,152
Built vast fortunes...

332
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,232
commanded great empires...

333
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:31,879
but at a terrible cost.

334
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,511
They have no one
who cares for them.

335
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:40,673
Mr. Pembroke is lucky.

336
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,115
He has you.

337
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:44,712
So, do your best to relax.

338
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,190
Enjoy yourself.

339
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:49,758
You are at the foot
of the Swiss Alps...

340
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,270
one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

341
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:55,194
Think of it
as an enforced vacation.

342
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:56,497
Although I know you Americans

343
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,716
are not so good
at vacations, are you?

344
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:01,352
And remember,
you're at altitude.

345
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:03,113
It can take a while
to acclimatize...

346
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:06,239
so please make sure
you drink plenty of water.

347
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,874
Believe me,
you're in good hands.

348
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,081
Are you lost?

349
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,077
Uh... Yeah.

350
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:21,595
I guess so.

351
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:23,399
Where is it
you're supposed to be?

352
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,595
I don't know.

353
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,070
Name?

354
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:29,549
Pembroke.

355
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:34,594
Roland Pembroke.

356
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:35,830
Here it is.

357
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,630
Pembroke. Room 609.
Steam bath.

358
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,433
Of course.

359
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,753
Mr. Pembroke...

360
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,912
the steam baths
are in that direction.

361
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:06,113
You can't go in there.

362
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:11,954
Not like that.

363
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:24,194
Pembroke?

364
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,356
It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?

365
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:33,514
Do I know you?

366
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,400
My name is Lockhart.
Mr. Green sent me.

367
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:39,479
I thought they'd send Morris.

368
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,080
Morris is dead.

369
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,549
Heart attack.

370
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,755
Mr. Pembroke, I've come to
bring you back to New York.

371
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:57,669
You want me to leave here?

372
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,240
Just for a few days.

373
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,229
I'm afraid I can't do that.

374
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,401
Why not?

375
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,350
I'm not well.

376
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:06,680
You look all right to me.

377
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:08,240
That's because you are blind.

378
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,600
As I was.

379
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,198
But soon you'll see.

380
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,194
Rest assured, they'll
take good care of you here.

381
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:20,232
I'm not a patient.

382
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,119
What happened to your leg?

383
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,479
Mr. Pembroke,
the situation in New York

384
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:26,636
is really quite serious.

385
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,393
No longer my concern.

386
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:31,590
The director says
I must not involve myself

387
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:33,074
in business matters.

388
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,473
Have you met Director Volmer?

389
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:37,561
This morning.

390
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,632
He is a great man.

391
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:42,440
Kind man.

392
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,557
Not like other doctors.

393
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:45,721
Mr. Pembroke...

394
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:47,917
This obsession with blood.

395
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:49,880
You see, they have it all wrong.

396
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,071
Do you know
the body is 65% water?

397
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:54,072
It's our fluids
that must be purified.

398
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,391
Word that the merger
is in trouble has leaked.

399
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:57,817
The share price is in free fall.

400
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:58,956
Lockhart?

401
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,801
You're not any relation
to Henry Lockhart, are you?

402
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:05,070
My father.

403
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:08,079
You knew him?

404
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:10,238
We started out together.

405
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,432
Terrible, what happened to him.

406
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,594
They said there was a boy
left in the car.

407
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,476
I don't remember much,
to be honest.

408
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,992
He didn't deserve
what we did to him.

409
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,440
What do you mean?

410
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,273
He was an honest man.

411
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,956
And we destroyed him for it.

412
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:42,113
Well, people get fucked over
every day.

413
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,954
Either you have what it takes
to survive, or you don't.

414
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:46,800
And I suppose you do.

415
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,317
Is that why
you came all this way?

416
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:51,840
Ambition?

417
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:56,515
Then you have it
worse than any of us.

418
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,834
What's that?

419
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,110
The sickness.

420
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,830
Your father saw the truth
long before the rest of us.

421
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:09,959
The pointlessness
of the entire endeavor.

422
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:13,470
We've all done terrible things.

423
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:16,797
So many terrible things.

424
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:48,435
What's it trading at?

425
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:50,996
What?

426
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,192
The stock!
What's it trading at?

427
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:56,081
Eight and a half
at close on Friday.

428
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:57,201
Parasites.

429
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,352
It'll be lower by now.

430
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:01,796
We're all concerned for your
well-being, Mr. Pembroke.

431
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,110
Mmm.

432
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,032
Just a few days.

433
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:06,857
There are certain irregularities

434
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:07,996
in some of the accounts...

435
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,514
that need to be clarified before

436
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:10,790
the merger can be completed.

437
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:14,918
And I suppose someone
has to take responsibility.

438
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,040
Something like that.

439
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,037
Then I better get my things.

440
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,030
I need a car
to take me to the station.

441
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:33,393
Will you call one for me,
please?

442
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,119
I'll see what I can do.

443
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,037
That's where the baron
hung the priest.

444
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,032
What's that?
See?

445
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:22,314
The church would have been
right over there...

446
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:24,457
where that funny
little building is now.

447
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:25,516
I'm sure of it.

448
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:28,033
People used to come
from miles around...

449
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:30,157
for the miracles attributed
to the holy water.

450
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,630
Guess some things don't change.

451
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:33,801
How marvelous.

452
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:37,196
Terrible thing, though.
Such violence.

453
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,636
That's what you get
for marrying your sister.

454
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:42,040
Sister?

455
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:44,271
Yeah, it was all about
a pure bloodline, wasn't it?

456
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:46,674
How fascinating!

457
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:47,841
I must look into that.

458
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,681
Glad to see
you're back on your feet!

459
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,793
We heard about the accident.

460
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:55,155
You're American,
aren't you, Mister...

461
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:56,390
Lockhart.

462
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,517
Frank Hill. Stockholm.

463
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:00,672
And this is Mr. Nair
from London.

464
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:02,160
Bombay, originally.

465
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:05,474
I see you've met Mrs. Watkins,
our amateur historian.

466
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:06,915
Yes, of course. How rude.

467
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:08,992
Victoria Watkins.
40 years at Xerox.

468
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:10,537
Why don't you pull up a chair?

469
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,994
We need a fourth.

470
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,072
Careful. Like most Brahmins,
he cheats.

471
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:17,197
Coming from
a venture capitalist,

472
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:18,595
I take that as a compliment.

473
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:20,160
Actually, I was just
on my way back

474
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:21,441
to New York with Mr. Pembroke.

475
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:26,830
Then he's...

476
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:28,910
He's feeling better?

477
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:32,034
Well enough.

478
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,360
I suppose that's wonderful news.

479
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:37,839
Isn't that right, Mr. Nair?

480
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:40,200
Wonderful news.

481
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,555
Mrs. Watkins...

482
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,116
time for your treatment.

483
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,350
Yes, of course.

484
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,236
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Lockhart.

485
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,595
Safe travels.

486
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:36,518
Something in the water?

487
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,193
At the bottom.

488
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:48,430
I don't see anything.

489
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,869
Did it hurt?

490
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,600
Can't remember.

491
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:00,600
Better that way.

492
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:04,994
I saw you.

493
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:07,280
Before.

494
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:11,439
Are you a patient here?

495
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:14,999
It's just,
you're so much younger

496
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,275
than everyone else.

497
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:21,194
Director Volmer says
I'm a special case.

498
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:25,114
What about you?

499
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,594
Are you here for the cure?

500
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:33,235
No.

501
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:34,954
Actually, I was just leaving.

502
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:36,554
No one ever leaves.

503
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,559
What are you talking about?

504
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,512
Why would anyone want to?

505
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,152
Yeah, I see your point.

506
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:58,951
Did you get what you came for?

507
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:05,510
Well, I came to bring
someone back to New York.

508
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:08,634
So, yeah. I did.

509
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,399
Does he want to go?

510
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:16,915
Not really.

511
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,392
That song you were singing.

512
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:27,995
Where did you learn that?

513
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:38,874
I have to go now.

514
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:46,272
What's your name?

515
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,115
Hannah.

516
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:32,514
Mr. Pembroke?

517
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:38,632
Where's Pembroke?

518
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:42,599
The patient that was
in this room, where is he?

519
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,912
I thought you were Pembroke.

520
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:04,031
Do you know
what they used to recommend

521
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:05,793
for the common stomach ailment?

522
00:45:05,961 --> 00:45:08,031
The application of leeches.

523
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:11,671
Based on the diagnosis,
I always pitied the leech.

524
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:17,551
Mmm. Mr. Lockhart...

525
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:19,234
please, won't you join us?

526
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:20,760
The sturgeon is excellent,

527
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:22,797
unless of course
you prefer the venison.

528
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,713
I couldn't let it go to waste.

529
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:26,959
Where's Pembroke?

530
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:30,437
Mr. Pembroke has unfortunately
taken a turn for the worse.

531
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:33,035
I fear your conversation
about business matters...

532
00:45:33,201 --> 00:45:34,953
has set him back somewhat.

533
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:36,952
But, no matter.
We have moved him on

534
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,281
to the next stage of treatment.

535
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,635
He looked all right to me.

536
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:41,115
But you're not a doctor.

537
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,272
Maybe it's time
for a second opinion.

538
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,591
That, of course,
is up to Mr. Pembroke.

539
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:47,393
And he's not available.

540
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:49,233
Ever since I got here...

541
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:51,437
you people have been
giving me the runaround.

542
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:53,481
I would ask you please
to keep your voice down.

543
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:55,950
We wouldn't wanna upset
the clientele, would we?

544
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:57,952
Mr. Lockhart,
giving you the runaround

545
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,713
is the furthest thing
from my mind.

546
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:03,157
My sole concern is for
the welfare of my patients.

547
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,795
It's bad for business if
people start getting better.

548
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:07,519
Am I right?

549
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,512
What are you implying,
Mr. Lockhart?

550
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:12,149
Old people paying through
the teeth for what? Water?

551
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:13,800
What's your overhead anyway?

552
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:15,559
That is not your concern.

553
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,598
I don't wanna have to
get lawyers involved...

554
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:19,592
but I came to get Pembroke
back to New York...

555
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:20,921
and that's what I'm gonna do,

556
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,377
if I have to hit him
over his head...

557
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:24,357
and drag him out by his hair.

558
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:27,833
Are you feeling all right,
Mr. Lockhart? You seem pale.

559
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:30,834
I'm fine.

560
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:34,310
You're bleeding.

561
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:36,670
What?

562
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:59,359
Perhaps you should sit down.

563
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:20,672
No signs of concussion.

564
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:23,392
Any headaches, hallucinations?

565
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:25,996
No.

566
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:28,030
You may dress.

567
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:31,598
Are you drinking the water?

568
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:33,441
Yes.

569
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,829
Good.

570
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,235
Make sure you do.

571
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,790
I took the liberty
of running a few tests

572
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:43,036
after the accident.

573
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:44,161
Hannah.

574
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:46,150
Isn't it?

575
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:47,881
Yes.

576
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:50,199
She's a very special case.

577
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:52,317
What does that mean exactly?

578
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:55,395
She was exposed
to serious trauma

579
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:56,630
when she was very young.

580
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,632
Her development was delayed.

581
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:02,592
Hannah did not utter a word
until she was 11 years old.

582
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,353
Please understand...

583
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:07,920
Mr. Lockhart...

584
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:12,554
she is like a daughter to me.

585
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:18,553
But we're here to discuss you.

586
00:48:20,241 --> 00:48:22,391
An imbalance in your fluids.

587
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:24,552
Strain to the major organs.

588
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:26,473
Depleted immune system.

589
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,518
Many indicators
that you have in common

590
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:29,829
with most of my patients...

591
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:32,401
but I will confess
I have never seen a case...

592
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,950
as advanced as this...

593
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:37,837
in someone so young.

594
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,594
Is that right?

595
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:46,159
Tell me, Mr. Lockhart...

596
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:50,274
when was the last time
that you actually felt well?

597
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,236
Before you came here,
when was the last time...

598
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:55,756
that you even slept
through the night?

599
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,630
The mind may lie...

600
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,633
but the body cannot.

601
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,151
I should like to help you.

602
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:05,321
What we offer here...

603
00:49:05,481 --> 00:49:08,473
is a simple process
of purification.

604
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,079
Away from pressures
of the modern world.

605
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:15,030
A return to a simpler time.

606
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:17,840
Mr. Pembroke will not be ready
to travel for a day or two.

607
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:19,915
And if you're willing...

608
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:22,595
I would like to
recommend a treatment.

609
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:24,913
I can speak to the duty nurse...

610
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:27,641
and we may be able to start
as early as this evening.

611
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:31,757
If you think it's necessary.

612
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:33,161
Good.

613
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:36,881
Greta?

614
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:38,916
Greta?

615
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,032
You're in luck, Mr. Lockhart.

616
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:57,872
We can get you in right away.

617
00:49:58,441 --> 00:49:59,635
"VR."

618
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:04,721
Von Reichmerl.

619
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,191
It was found
during the reconstruction.

620
00:50:09,961 --> 00:50:11,997
Then it belong to the baron?

621
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:14,436
The baroness, actually.

622
00:50:14,601 --> 00:50:16,557
Vanessa Von Reichmerl.

623
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,393
She was sickly.

624
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,237
The Baron was obsessed
with finding a cure.

625
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,951
It was he, in fact,
who first discovered

626
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:28,032
the medicinal properties
of our water.

627
00:50:31,481 --> 00:50:33,597
He sacrificed everything.

628
00:50:34,121 --> 00:50:36,191
He must have
loved her very much.

629
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:38,836
Yes.

630
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,080
Like a sister.

631
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,670
History is right, of course,
to judge him on moral grounds.

632
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,111
But, as a man of science...

633
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:55,198
I can't help but admire him.

634
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:00,837
The duty nurse will escort you
to our isolation wing.

635
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:03,361
Thank you.

636
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,521
Mr. Lockhart...

637
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:11,719
If you wouldn't mind.

638
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:15,319
Just so we can keep an eye
on your progress.

639
00:52:21,761 --> 00:52:23,274
Are you ready, Mr. Lockhart?

640
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,319
Then let us begin.

641
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:37,591
Life on this planet
first came from water.

642
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:45,473
We spend the first nine months
of our existence submerged...

643
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:48,036
our bodies mostly liquid.

644
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:50,795
This sensory deprivation chamber

645
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:52,155
simulates a return...

646
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:54,312
to that embryonic state.

647
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:58,474
Think of it
as a cleansing of the mind...

648
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:00,279
as much as the body.

649
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:06,470
Some patients experience
increased heart rate...

650
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,120
visions...

651
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:11,240
even primal memories.

652
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,481
But rest assured,

653
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:16,121
it's just the toxins
leaving the system.

654
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:21,279
Give yourself over completely
to the process...

655
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,590
and you will see the results.

656
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:27,836
Keep a close eye on him.

657
00:53:28,001 --> 00:53:29,001
Yes, sir.

658
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:35,961
Mr. Lockhart...

659
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,271
the treatment lasts 30 minutes.

660
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,537
I'll be monitoring you
from here.

661
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:40,561
If you have any issues...

662
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:42,393
just tap on the side
of the tank.

663
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:21,716
Get back!

664
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:26,841
In the last five days,

665
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,036
a total collapse.

666
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:31,034
The Dow plunging
over 508 points...

667
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,510
as panic spread
throughout Wall Street...

668
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:34,836
wiping out more than

669
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:36,257
one-third of the gains...

670
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:38,033
from this rare,
five-year bull market.

671
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:40,840
More than half of that
in a single trading day.

672
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:43,799
Chairman of New York
Stock Exchange, John Phelan...

673
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,952
tried to reassure investors.

674
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:58,270
Dad?

675
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:04,956
Dad!

676
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,439
Mr. Lockhart,
are you all right?

677
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:14,601
Get off me.

678
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:15,870
Try to stay calm.

679
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,137
I'm terribly sorry.

680
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,457
Something must have
gone wrong with the machine.

681
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:19,880
There's something in the water.

682
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,912
There's something
in the fucking water.

683
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:45,635
There is nothing in the water,
Mr. Lockhart.

684
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,719
But I saw them.

685
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:00,109
As the Director explained...

686
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:01,999
some patients experience visions

687
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,400
with this particular treatment.

688
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:05,990
Just the toxins
leaving the body.

689
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,152
It's all part of the cure.

690
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:11,671
You need to rest now.

691
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,513
I will help you to your room.

692
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,349
Got you.

693
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:38,190
Morning, Lockhart.

694
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:40,161
Feeling better?

695
01:01:44,561 --> 01:01:46,199
Joining us for breakfast?

696
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:47,840
The kedgeree is excellent.

697
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:49,400
I'm not hungry.

698
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:52,199
You must keep up your strength.

699
01:01:56,681 --> 01:01:57,716
Mrs. Watkins?

700
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:02,071
That building
where the church used to be...

701
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,000
What's it used for now?

702
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:05,960
I couldn't say.

703
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:10,191
You were right about
the baron and his sister.

704
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:11,476
But that's not the reason

705
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,279
the villagers burned
the place down.

706
01:02:13,441 --> 01:02:15,397
It was on account
of the experiments.

707
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:17,521
Some sort of
medical experiments.

708
01:02:20,241 --> 01:02:22,152
Apparently performed
on his own peasants.

709
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,959
People went missing.

710
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:25,190
And then...

711
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:28,751
I'm Jahre 1814...

712
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:33,233
farmers, tilling their fields,
stumbled on human bodies...

713
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:35,596
disfigured and emaciated.

714
01:02:36,161 --> 01:02:39,517
Dried up like
the mummies of Egypt.

715
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,593
He was looking for a cure.

716
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,592
A cure?
For the baroness.

717
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:47,194
She was sick.

718
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:49,200
Oh, I see.

719
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:53,075
I knew you liked puzzles.

720
01:02:58,121 --> 01:02:59,520
Of course.

721
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:01,401
Mrs. Watkins...

722
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:03,474
time for your treatment.

723
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:05,681
Are you certain?

724
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:07,712
I just had one this morning.
I'm sure of it.

725
01:03:10,121 --> 01:03:11,952
I have you on the schedule.

726
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:17,633
I must not
be feeling myself today.

727
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,111
There is
a terrible darkness here.

728
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:51,155
What is this place?

729
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:57,156
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

730
01:03:57,321 --> 01:03:58,834
I thought I saw you
with a patient.

731
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:03,471
No. Patient.

732
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,350
Okay.

733
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:14,510
Thank you.

734
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:25,441
Going for a swim?

735
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:30,192
I'm not supposed to.

736
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:32,681
Why's that?

737
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:35,036
On the account of my condition.

738
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,798
Thought the water
made you better.

739
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:40,831
Told you. I'm a special case.

740
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:43,830
Right.

741
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:47,519
How far is it to town?

742
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,712
A few miles, I think.

743
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:58,392
Are you going to walk
all the way?

744
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:03,757
Unless you wanna
lend me your bike.

745
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,593
What will you give me?

746
01:05:27,481 --> 01:05:29,039
It was my mother's.

747
01:05:36,241 --> 01:05:37,993
Her eyes are closed.

748
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:41,274
Yeah, she's dreaming.
She just doesn't know it.

749
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:46,390
What happens if she wakes up?

750
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:49,836
I don't know.

751
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:52,837
My mother
never finished the story.

752
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:58,875
So, we got a deal?

753
01:06:01,321 --> 01:06:03,516
How will you ride it?

754
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:06,032
Maybe you could come along.

755
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:08,797
I'm not supposed to.

756
01:06:09,201 --> 01:06:11,761
You always do
what you're supposed to do?

757
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:22,956
It's okay.

758
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,350
Coming?

759
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,594
Want a beer or something?

760
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,875
I don't know. Do I?

761
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:25,314
I don't know what you want.

762
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:28,237
All right.
If you're having one.

763
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:39,961
Still here?

764
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,436
Thought you were just visiting.

765
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:45,233
You've looked better.

766
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,440
Same to you.

767
01:08:48,321 --> 01:08:49,436
How's the car?

768
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:51,552
That car was a piece of shit.

769
01:08:51,721 --> 01:08:55,794
Sanitarium offered me enough
to buy a new one.

770
01:08:55,961 --> 01:08:57,314
So, gracias a Dios.

771
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:59,631
Everything happens
for a reason, right?

772
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,116
You drink too much.

773
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:06,031
I hope you're not driving.

774
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:09,591
You two are from up on the hill?

775
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:11,670
That's right.

776
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:14,036
We don't get
many patients down here.

777
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:24,993
Good kids at heart.

778
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,560
Just weren't raised properly.

779
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:29,672
No respect for tradition.

780
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,912
Know if there's
a doctor in town?

781
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:35,712
All the doctors
are up on the hill.

782
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:37,394
A pharmacist?

783
01:09:37,561 --> 01:09:39,074
Something like that?

784
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,709
There's Pieter. Over the road.

785
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:43,919
He a doctor?

786
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,759
Close enough.

787
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:13,035
Don't you like it?

788
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:16,194
No.

789
01:10:16,361 --> 01:10:18,397
What, you never had
a beer before?

790
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:28,717
How long have you
been at the sanitarium?

791
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:31,156
Since I can remember.

792
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:32,834
What about your family?

793
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,475
My mother died in a fire
when I was young.

794
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:38,471
Director Volmer says that
my father will come for me

795
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:39,789
when I'm better.

796
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:42,800
Does he visit?

797
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:45,918
He'll come when I'm better.

798
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,837
Vitamins?
Mmm-hmm.

799
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,354
Can I try?

800
01:10:56,481 --> 01:10:57,481
Um...

801
01:10:59,241 --> 01:11:00,276
Okay.

802
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:08,321
Ugh.

803
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:13,396
Tastes like sweaty seafood.

804
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:17,113
You get used to it.
Eventually.

805
01:11:20,961 --> 01:11:22,838
Will you be okay here
for a few minutes?

806
01:11:25,241 --> 01:11:26,959
I just have to go see
about something.

807
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,872
But I won't be long.

808
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:33,357
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

809
01:11:59,121 --> 01:12:00,395
Hello?

810
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:14,992
Do you know
if there's a doctor here?

811
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:23,280
What's that you're drawing?

812
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:25,959
He won't talk to you.

813
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:30,159
Doesn't know how.

814
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,081
That's the castle...

815
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,832
when they burned it down.

816
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:41,431
My grandson, Wilmosh.

817
01:12:41,601 --> 01:12:43,876
He likes ghost stories.

818
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,633
What can I do for you?

819
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:50,835
Could you take a look at this,
tell me what it says?

820
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:52,481
Human?

821
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:53,875
That's right.

822
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,110
Not my line.

823
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:56,396
I'll pay you.

824
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:02,115
How much is this?

825
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:06,270
Not much.

826
01:13:09,161 --> 01:13:10,560
But enough.

827
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:47,030
Got a tampon?

828
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,678
My friend's time of the month.

829
01:13:57,881 --> 01:13:58,950
Freak.

830
01:13:59,161 --> 01:14:00,674
So is he fit to travel?

831
01:14:01,601 --> 01:14:03,557
He's not a well man.

832
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:05,791
Some of those are
dental records, aren't they?

833
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:08,159
That's right.
What do they mean?

834
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,277
His teeth are falling out.

835
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:14,759
What could cause
something like that?

836
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,996
Barring any pre-existing
condition, I'd say...

837
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,992
chronic dehydration.

838
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,520
Dehydration?

839
01:14:26,481 --> 01:14:28,517
All they do up there
is drink water.

840
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:32,878
I'm not a doctor.

841
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,315
Now, if you'll excuse me...

842
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:35,994
Wait a second.

843
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:38,872
The baron's experiments.

844
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,713
They found bodies
in the fields, right?

845
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:42,792
Dried up like mummies.

846
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:44,872
Maybe there's
some kind of connection.

847
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:47,235
The baron was burned alive

848
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,754
on his wedding night
200 years ago.

849
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:51,600
Yeah, but this is happening now.

850
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:53,035
People come here for the cure.

851
01:14:53,161 --> 01:14:54,217
That's what the baron
was looking for.

852
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:55,241
His wife was sick.

853
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,794
She wasn't sick.

854
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:00,039
She was infertile.

855
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:56,792
They tried for years.

856
01:15:57,281 --> 01:15:59,670
But the baroness could not
carry a child to term.

857
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,353
They say her body
rejected the fetuses

858
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:03,669
because they were deformed.

859
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:08,311
Now, you must excuse me.

860
01:16:09,161 --> 01:16:11,800
I have to put this animal
out of its misery.

861
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:17,072
What's wrong with it?

862
01:16:17,241 --> 01:16:20,358
Wandered off where
it wasn't supposed to be.

863
01:16:20,521 --> 01:16:21,954
Broke its leg.

864
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:24,110
Like you.

865
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,350
Found it trapped
in a drainage ditch...

866
01:16:30,201 --> 01:16:31,554
drinking sewage water.

867
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:19,917
I need to make a phone call.
Long distance.

868
01:18:20,081 --> 01:18:21,309
Your credit card.

869
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,440
Lockhart.

870
01:18:37,601 --> 01:18:38,670
Mr. Green.

871
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:40,194
Where the hell have you been?

872
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:41,675
I have a question.

873
01:18:41,841 --> 01:18:43,797
Did Pembroke have
any pre-existing conditions?

874
01:18:43,961 --> 01:18:45,041
What are you talking about?

875
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,236
Before he got here.

876
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,630
Any medical conditions?
Was he sick?

877
01:18:48,801 --> 01:18:50,632
No. The guy is
a fucking health nut.

878
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:52,632
Drank kale for Christ's sake.

879
01:18:52,801 --> 01:18:53,857
Now what the fuck is going on?

880
01:18:53,881 --> 01:18:55,337
You were supposed to be here
four days ago.

881
01:18:55,361 --> 01:18:56,840
Yeah. But there was
an accident.

882
01:18:57,641 --> 01:18:58,641
What accident?

883
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:00,716
What?

884
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:03,591
I don't understand.
They said they called you.

885
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:05,434
Nobody called.

886
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:13,313
Are you sure about that?

887
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:15,392
Lockhart, do I have to
reiterate to you...

888
01:19:15,601 --> 01:19:17,641
the importance of what
you've been sent there to do?

889
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:20,001
Get Pembroke on a plane
within the next 24 hours...

890
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:22,271
or this whole place
goes ass over tits.

891
01:19:22,481 --> 01:19:23,755
And you with it.
Understand me?

892
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:28,830
Lockhart?

893
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,190
Lockhart!

894
01:19:34,961 --> 01:19:36,599
I need to speak with you
Hey, hey, hey.

895
01:19:36,761 --> 01:19:38,337
You said no one ever leaves.
What does that mean?

896
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:39,396
You're hurting me.

897
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:41,358
What happens to them?
Please let me go.

898
01:19:41,521 --> 01:19:42,954
Why won't they
let me see Pembroke?

899
01:19:43,121 --> 01:19:44,177
You know something, don't you?

900
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:45,236
No.

901
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:48,717
What is this stuff?
What makes you special?

902
01:19:48,841 --> 01:19:50,320
Fuck off, Adolf!

903
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:54,110
Hey!

904
01:19:54,281 --> 01:19:55,475
Come on.
No!

905
01:19:56,081 --> 01:19:57,400
I paid for this dance.
No!

906
01:19:57,601 --> 01:19:58,636
Let her go!

907
01:19:58,721 --> 01:20:00,757
Go back
to the sanitarium, cripple.

908
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:02,236
No!

909
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,758
No! Please, stop!

910
01:20:04,921 --> 01:20:07,355
I am not a patient.

911
01:20:58,761 --> 01:20:59,876
Hannah.

912
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,041
Hannah.

913
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:18,272
She may look like a woman...

914
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,240
but she's just a child.

915
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,398
Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart...

916
01:21:28,161 --> 01:21:30,721
is the great enemy of science.

917
01:21:31,121 --> 01:21:32,839
I wanna see Pembroke.

918
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:35,790
And you will.

919
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:48,879
Coming, Mr. Lockhart?

920
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:53,230
Nothing happened.

921
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:55,121
That's because
I arrived when I did.

922
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:57,319
Lockhart was there.

923
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:59,278
With a knife to his throat.

924
01:21:59,441 --> 01:22:00,556
Hannah...

925
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:02,537
Mr. Lockhart is not able
to look after himself,

926
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:03,630
let alone you.

927
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:05,598
He can't protect you
the way I can.

928
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:06,989
I don't need protecting.

929
01:22:07,121 --> 01:22:08,349
Of course you do.

930
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:11,519
We were just having fun.

931
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:14,033
He's not like the others.

932
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:16,480
He's young.

933
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:22,590
What?

934
01:22:22,761 --> 01:22:24,433
- What is it?
- Nothing.

935
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:25,601
Let me see.
No.

936
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:26,841
I'm your doctor. Come here.

937
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:28,156
No! Don't touch me!

938
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,873
When will I be ready?

939
01:22:39,161 --> 01:22:40,196
Soon.

940
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:46,761
When?

941
01:22:47,441 --> 01:22:48,669
Patience.

942
01:22:51,681 --> 01:22:52,875
Come here.

943
01:22:55,161 --> 01:22:56,719
I said, come here.

944
01:23:03,881 --> 01:23:06,839
Now, haven't I always
looked after you?

945
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:10,916
Soon, I will make you better.

946
01:23:11,881 --> 01:23:13,394
And you will thank me.

947
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:18,399
And my father will come?

948
01:23:21,241 --> 01:23:22,356
Yes.

949
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:29,071
Get some rest, my little lamb.

950
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:31,801
Bitte?

951
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:36,399
I have a problem with my...

952
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:38,994
May I?

953
01:26:43,801 --> 01:26:45,321
I'll just pop it
in some milk, shall I?

954
01:27:10,321 --> 01:27:11,470
There we are.

955
01:31:10,401 --> 01:31:11,401
Mrs. Watkins?

956
01:31:17,361 --> 01:31:18,589
Where's Pembroke?

957
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:21,354
You took him.

958
01:31:22,841 --> 01:31:24,069
Back to New York.

959
01:31:24,241 --> 01:31:26,118
What? No.

960
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,431
They moved him.
He's down here somewhere.

961
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:32,349
You told me about
the experiments, remember?

962
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:34,034
Your puzzle?

963
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:36,032
I like puzzles.

964
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:37,270
Yeah.

965
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,875
I left it for you.

966
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:41,599
You'll see.

967
01:31:42,401 --> 01:31:43,629
Listen to me.

968
01:31:44,561 --> 01:31:46,040
The experiments...

969
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:47,919
I think they're happening again.

970
01:31:48,081 --> 01:31:49,753
The baroness was infertile.

971
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,593
Not experiments.

972
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:54,435
A cure.

973
01:31:55,721 --> 01:31:58,235
She was pregnant
the night of the wedding.

974
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:01,036
Before they burned her...

975
01:32:02,281 --> 01:32:04,476
the villagers cut out
the fetus...

976
01:32:04,641 --> 01:32:06,472
and threw it in the aquifer.

977
01:32:07,641 --> 01:32:09,757
The child survived.

978
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:14,240
She doesn't know.

979
01:35:13,321 --> 01:35:15,232
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

980
01:35:18,121 --> 01:35:19,121
Take it easy.

981
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:21,239
Marcus!

982
01:35:21,441 --> 01:35:23,113
It's all right.

983
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:24,955
Mr. Lockhart...

984
01:35:25,121 --> 01:35:26,395
every time I turn around,

985
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,161
you're somewhere
you're not supposed to be.

986
01:35:28,321 --> 01:35:30,152
I guess I'm lost.

987
01:35:31,121 --> 01:35:33,351
I'm just trying to find
my way back to my room.

988
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:34,937
This is a restricted floor.

989
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:36,110
There are signs everywhere.

990
01:35:36,281 --> 01:35:39,193
Surely you didn't just wander
down here by accident?

991
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:41,869
What is it exactly that
you are looking for?

992
01:35:43,921 --> 01:35:46,993
I had a problem with my tooth.

993
01:35:47,761 --> 01:35:48,989
Your tooth?

994
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:51,994
Actually,
it's feeling much better.

995
01:35:52,161 --> 01:35:54,595
If you could just point me
in the direction of my room.

996
01:35:54,761 --> 01:35:56,160
Nonsense.

997
01:35:56,321 --> 01:35:58,835
We can't let you
get an infection.

998
01:35:59,001 --> 01:36:01,310
You must let us
take care of you.

999
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:02,521
After all...

1000
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:05,151
that's why you're here.

1001
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:13,960
Doctor Brennan takes care

1002
01:36:14,081 --> 01:36:16,197
of all our patients'
dental needs.

1003
01:36:35,881 --> 01:36:37,030
I'm sorry.

1004
01:36:37,561 --> 01:36:38,561
Hmm?

1005
01:36:38,601 --> 01:36:39,636
About Hannah.

1006
01:36:42,041 --> 01:36:43,315
It won't happen again.

1007
01:36:43,441 --> 01:36:44,441
Hmm.

1008
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:48,315
Tell me...

1009
01:36:49,761 --> 01:36:51,114
what were you doing in town?

1010
01:36:53,601 --> 01:36:55,034
Just having a beer.

1011
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:56,310
Ah. Hmm.

1012
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:02,720
What are you doing?

1013
01:37:03,241 --> 01:37:04,310
Get your hands off me!

1014
01:37:04,921 --> 01:37:07,230
It's all for your own safety,
Mr. Lockhart.

1015
01:37:08,081 --> 01:37:11,391
We don't believe in chemical
anesthesia at the institute.

1016
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:14,474
The impurities inhibit the cure.

1017
01:37:14,681 --> 01:37:17,798
But, you will find that
with a proper focus...

1018
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:21,636
the mind can overcome
any amount of pain.

1019
01:37:26,921 --> 01:37:29,913
Trust, Mr. Lockhart. Hmm?

1020
01:37:34,201 --> 01:37:36,431
I mean, if we can't
trust each other...

1021
01:37:37,281 --> 01:37:39,192
then how can I help you?

1022
01:37:56,681 --> 01:37:57,955
Mrs. Abramov...

1023
01:37:59,321 --> 01:38:00,720
so glad that you are here.

1024
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:02,633
How long do we have you with us?

1025
01:38:02,801 --> 01:38:04,200
Just two weeks.

1026
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:05,635
I probably over-packed.

1027
01:38:05,801 --> 01:38:06,836
Nonsense.

1028
01:38:07,001 --> 01:38:10,391
You'll be surprised
how time just slips away

1029
01:38:10,481 --> 01:38:11,800
here at the institute.

1030
01:38:20,801 --> 01:38:21,801
Drive!

1031
01:38:21,881 --> 01:38:22,961
What happened to your face?

1032
01:38:23,001 --> 01:38:24,001
Just drive!

1033
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:33,200
They held me down
and pulled my tooth out.

1034
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:35,352
They threatened me.

1035
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:37,159
Why would they do that?

1036
01:38:37,841 --> 01:38:40,594
Because I know
what they've done.

1037
01:38:41,481 --> 01:38:43,597
There is a room full of bodies

1038
01:38:43,681 --> 01:38:45,831
floating in tanks
like specimens.

1039
01:38:48,441 --> 01:38:51,001
These are
very serious allegations.

1040
01:38:51,401 --> 01:38:52,550
No shit.

1041
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,070
Director Volmer is
a well-respected man.

1042
01:38:56,841 --> 01:38:58,281
The sanatorium
is of great importance

1043
01:38:58,361 --> 01:38:59,396
for the local economy.

1044
01:38:59,561 --> 01:39:02,029
Take me up there,
and I'll show you what I saw.

1045
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:06,679
Do you have
any identification on you?

1046
01:39:07,401 --> 01:39:09,517
No, they have everything.

1047
01:39:09,681 --> 01:39:11,876
Well, then, is there someone
I could speak to...

1048
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:14,874
who might confirm you are
who you say you are? Family?

1049
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:18,360
I hope you understand the need
to verify your identity.

1050
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:20,759
You can call my office.

1051
01:39:23,361 --> 01:39:24,714
All right.

1052
01:39:25,721 --> 01:39:27,712
Can I get you coffee or tea?

1053
01:39:30,561 --> 01:39:32,597
You got anything stronger?

1054
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,110
Of course.

1055
01:39:38,081 --> 01:39:39,230
Rest assured...

1056
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:43,552
we will get
to the bottom of this.

1057
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:46,390
Thank you.

1058
01:40:47,681 --> 01:40:49,797
Mr. Lockhart,
we've been worried about you.

1059
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,314
Stay away from me!

1060
01:40:51,521 --> 01:40:52,657
Is this man a patient of yours?

1061
01:40:52,681 --> 01:40:53,681
Yes, that's right.

1062
01:40:53,841 --> 01:40:56,355
I'm not a patient.
I was in an accident.

1063
01:40:56,521 --> 01:40:59,877
You signed the admission form.
I have it right here.

1064
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,110
That's bullshit.

1065
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:04,552
I did warn you about
possible delusions, remember?

1066
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:06,677
A side effect of the toxins
leaving the body.

1067
01:41:06,841 --> 01:41:08,718
And my leg, is that a delusion?

1068
01:41:08,881 --> 01:41:11,395
Mr. Lockhart has been
a disruptive element

1069
01:41:11,481 --> 01:41:12,550
since he arrived.

1070
01:41:12,721 --> 01:41:14,916
He stole
confidential medical files...

1071
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:17,311
assaulted a member
of our Dental staff...

1072
01:41:17,481 --> 01:41:18,834
and threatened Mr. Pembroke.

1073
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:21,310
I didn't threaten anybody!

1074
01:41:21,481 --> 01:41:24,712
I believe
your exact words were...

1075
01:41:25,321 --> 01:41:28,233
"If I have to,
I'll hit him over the head

1076
01:41:28,321 --> 01:41:30,152
"and drag him out
by his hair."

1077
01:41:30,321 --> 01:41:34,234
I was sent here to bring
Pembroke back to New York!

1078
01:41:34,441 --> 01:41:37,831
According to your employer,
a Mr. Green...

1079
01:41:38,001 --> 01:41:39,195
you're being investigated

1080
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:41,158
by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

1081
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:43,590
You're one of them.

1082
01:41:43,761 --> 01:41:45,558
Listen to yourself,
Mr. Lockhart.

1083
01:41:45,721 --> 01:41:46,836
You're not a well man.

1084
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:49,356
Stop saying that!

1085
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,193
Let us help you.
Get back!

1086
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:54,515
I know about the experiments.

1087
01:41:54,681 --> 01:41:56,194
The baron and his wife.

1088
01:41:56,361 --> 01:42:00,400
He has been spending time
with Mrs. Watkins.

1089
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:01,561
Who is Watkins?

1090
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:04,912
She was institutionalized
before she came to us.

1091
01:42:05,081 --> 01:42:06,514
The others humor her...

1092
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:08,916
but clearly
Mr. Lockhart's condition

1093
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:11,191
has made him susceptible
to her conspiracies.

1094
01:42:11,361 --> 01:42:13,750
I know what you're
trying to do. All of you.

1095
01:42:13,921 --> 01:42:16,196
You're trying to make me
think I'm insane.

1096
01:42:16,401 --> 01:42:18,278
I have seen this before.

1097
01:42:18,481 --> 01:42:19,960
It's not uncommon.

1098
01:42:20,121 --> 01:42:23,716
Some deep-seated childhood
trauma rises to the surface...

1099
01:42:23,881 --> 01:42:25,837
something a patient
has been running from

1100
01:42:25,921 --> 01:42:27,149
their entire life.

1101
01:42:28,281 --> 01:42:29,760
In your case...

1102
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:33,311
I would say misplaced guilt...

1103
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:36,390
over the death of your father.

1104
01:42:37,401 --> 01:42:40,120
How do you know about that?
I never told you that.

1105
01:42:40,841 --> 01:42:42,240
You didn't have to.

1106
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:45,152
That's why you came to us,
isn't it?

1107
01:42:46,921 --> 01:42:48,991
I saw him.

1108
01:42:49,161 --> 01:42:51,231
Pembroke is dead.

1109
01:42:51,401 --> 01:42:53,995
That's what this is all about?

1110
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:57,756
The evil doctor
killing off his patients?

1111
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:58,956
That's right.

1112
01:42:59,121 --> 01:43:03,080
All right. Perhaps we should
consult Mr. Pembroke.

1113
01:43:07,441 --> 01:43:08,999
Do you know this man?

1114
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:12,356
He tried to take me back
against my will.

1115
01:43:14,161 --> 01:43:15,594
Pembroke?

1116
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:16,955
Please keep him away from me.

1117
01:43:17,761 --> 01:43:19,479
You were dead.

1118
01:43:19,641 --> 01:43:21,081
Do you wish press charges?

1119
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:22,401
That won't be necessary.

1120
01:43:22,441 --> 01:43:24,591
Mr. Lockhart
is not a criminal.

1121
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:30,280
He is a patient.

1122
01:45:28,441 --> 01:45:30,750
To the members of the board...

1123
01:45:31,721 --> 01:45:34,030
You sent me here for a purpose.

1124
01:45:36,401 --> 01:45:38,596
To retrieve a man
against his will...

1125
01:45:40,201 --> 01:45:43,079
and bring him back
to your world.

1126
01:45:45,121 --> 01:45:46,440
But I realize now...

1127
01:45:48,641 --> 01:45:51,075
that is not the reason
I am here.

1128
01:45:52,641 --> 01:45:56,429
There is a sickness
inside each of us.

1129
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:59,115
We do our best
to deny its existence...

1130
01:45:59,281 --> 01:46:00,919
dealing in lies...

1131
01:46:01,921 --> 01:46:03,479
and distraction.

1132
01:46:05,321 --> 01:46:07,994
Until one day the body
rebels against the mind

1133
01:46:08,121 --> 01:46:09,236
and screams out...

1134
01:46:11,801 --> 01:46:14,554
"I am not a well man."

1135
01:46:16,641 --> 01:46:19,109
A man cannot unsee the truth.

1136
01:46:25,681 --> 01:46:29,674
A man cannot unsee the truth.

1137
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:43,997
He cannot willingly
return to darkness...

1138
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:49,634
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...

1139
01:46:54,961 --> 01:46:57,521
any more than he can be unborn.

1140
01:54:49,281 --> 01:54:50,350
Fuck.

1141
01:56:18,681 --> 01:56:19,681
Hannah!

1142
01:56:22,881 --> 01:56:23,916
Stay away from me.

1143
01:56:24,441 --> 01:56:25,715
Hannah.
Stay away from me.

1144
01:56:25,881 --> 01:56:27,553
We need to go.
I said stay away!

1145
01:56:32,361 --> 01:56:33,999
There.
Everything is all right.

1146
01:56:34,081 --> 01:56:35,275
Please enjoy your meal.

1147
01:56:37,641 --> 01:56:38,710
Hannah?

1148
01:56:39,441 --> 01:56:41,238
What have you done?

1149
01:56:46,081 --> 01:56:47,753
What's happening to me?

1150
01:56:49,241 --> 01:56:51,072
Here, here, here.

1151
01:56:51,241 --> 01:56:52,959
It's all right.
You're safe now.

1152
01:56:53,081 --> 01:56:54,081
Leave her alone.

1153
01:56:54,241 --> 01:56:56,118
Haven't you upset her enough,
Mr. Lockhart?

1154
01:56:56,321 --> 01:56:58,017
Please, escort the patient
back to his room.

1155
01:56:58,041 --> 01:56:59,269
I am not a fucking patient!

1156
01:57:05,641 --> 01:57:06,641
Come on!

1157
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:08,761
Come on!

1158
01:57:09,241 --> 01:57:10,959
Had enough of cripples
and old people?

1159
01:57:11,081 --> 01:57:12,116
Try it with me!

1160
01:57:12,281 --> 01:57:14,715
That's enough! Mr. Lockhart...

1161
01:57:14,921 --> 01:57:16,434
I can see
you're extremely upset.

1162
01:57:16,601 --> 01:57:18,319
Why don't you come with me
to my office...

1163
01:57:18,481 --> 01:57:20,437
and we can discuss
whatever's on your mind.

1164
01:57:20,921 --> 01:57:21,921
No.

1165
01:57:22,601 --> 01:57:24,432
We're gonna talk about it
right here.

1166
01:57:28,281 --> 01:57:29,281
In front of everybody.

1167
01:57:29,441 --> 01:57:30,760
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1168
01:57:30,921 --> 01:57:32,832
He's making you sick.

1169
01:57:34,321 --> 01:57:37,518
This place is making you sick!

1170
01:57:43,601 --> 01:57:44,954
It's in the water.

1171
01:57:47,001 --> 01:57:48,150
Mr. Lockhart.

1172
01:57:48,321 --> 01:57:50,755
I saw the bodies
dried up like mummies!

1173
01:57:52,641 --> 01:57:53,790
Look at you people!

1174
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:55,480
Your teeth are falling out!

1175
01:57:57,201 --> 01:57:59,112
You're dying,
and you can't even see it.

1176
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:00,680
But I'm here for the cure.

1177
01:58:00,881 --> 01:58:02,075
There is no cure!

1178
01:58:04,521 --> 01:58:05,874
Don't you see?

1179
01:58:06,321 --> 01:58:09,313
He's the one
that is making you sick!

1180
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:11,312
There's nothing wrong
with you people!

1181
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:13,830
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

1182
01:58:15,121 --> 01:58:16,873
There's nothing wrong with you.

1183
01:58:23,481 --> 01:58:24,481
Yes.

1184
01:58:25,721 --> 01:58:26,721
Yes!

1185
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:30,836
That's it!

1186
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:32,315
Stand up!

1187
01:58:36,521 --> 01:58:37,795
Come on!

1188
01:58:38,001 --> 01:58:39,001
Yes!

1189
01:58:39,641 --> 01:58:40,676
Stand up!

1190
01:58:41,881 --> 01:58:43,519
He is making you sick!

1191
01:58:45,081 --> 01:58:46,753
Yes, that's it. Come on.

1192
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:49,515
That's it!

1193
01:58:50,721 --> 01:58:52,996
There's nothing wrong with you!

1194
01:58:54,081 --> 01:58:56,993
I am not well.

1195
01:58:57,161 --> 01:58:58,560
I am not well.

1196
01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:00,875
What are you doing?

1197
01:59:02,401 --> 01:59:03,401
What are you doing?

1198
01:59:08,361 --> 01:59:09,361
Get the fuck off me!

1199
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:11,432
No. No, no!

1200
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:13,076
Get off me.

1201
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:15,239
Help me! Help!

1202
01:59:53,601 --> 01:59:55,114
Pembroke.

1203
01:59:55,761 --> 01:59:57,114
Pembroke.

1204
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:03,558
What have they done to you?

1205
02:00:04,441 --> 02:00:05,920
Done to me?

1206
02:00:07,481 --> 02:00:09,472
I've never felt better.

1207
02:00:13,801 --> 02:00:15,519
Relax, Mr. Lockhart.

1208
02:00:15,681 --> 02:00:17,114
It'll all be over soon.

1209
02:00:18,801 --> 02:00:21,793
Ah, yes. Remarkable creatures.

1210
02:00:24,641 --> 02:00:26,950
Anywhere else on the planet,

1211
02:00:27,081 --> 02:00:29,800
this species lives
a dozen years, at most.

1212
02:00:29,961 --> 02:00:32,156
Here, in our aquifer...

1213
02:00:32,961 --> 02:00:34,155
they can live 300.

1214
02:00:36,321 --> 02:00:38,118
For the human physiology...

1215
02:00:38,281 --> 02:00:40,841
the effect of the water
can be quite toxic

1216
02:00:41,001 --> 02:00:42,514
as you have discovered.

1217
02:00:43,681 --> 02:00:46,673
Unless, of course,
it is properly filtered.

1218
02:00:50,161 --> 02:00:52,038
The baron devised the process.

1219
02:00:53,481 --> 02:00:57,520
Using the bodies of peasants
that belonged to his land...

1220
02:00:58,521 --> 02:01:00,989
he managed
to distill the water...

1221
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:03,712
to its life-giving essence.

1222
02:01:06,041 --> 02:01:07,156
Of course, he paid

1223
02:01:07,321 --> 02:01:09,391
a terrible price
for his ingenuity.

1224
02:01:10,121 --> 02:01:11,121
His only mistake...

1225
02:01:12,201 --> 02:01:14,510
was to use subjects
who were unwilling.

1226
02:01:15,361 --> 02:01:18,239
Luckily, times have changed.

1227
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:22,196
The last 200 years

1228
02:01:22,321 --> 02:01:24,312
have been the most
productive in human history.

1229
02:01:24,481 --> 02:01:26,836
Man rid himself of God...

1230
02:01:27,001 --> 02:01:30,038
of hierarchy, of everything
that gave him meaning...

1231
02:01:30,201 --> 02:01:31,714
until he was left worshiping

1232
02:01:31,841 --> 02:01:34,036
the empty altar
of his own ambition.

1233
02:01:40,561 --> 02:01:42,199
That is why they come.

1234
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:44,156
Men like you.

1235
02:01:47,601 --> 02:01:49,353
You're quite right,
Mr. Lockhart.

1236
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:50,874
No one ever leaves.

1237
02:01:51,361 --> 02:01:54,910
What you fail to understand
is that no one wants to.

1238
02:02:14,041 --> 02:02:17,238
Do you know what the cure
for the human condition is?

1239
02:02:20,081 --> 02:02:21,081
Disease.

1240
02:02:21,761 --> 02:02:25,310
Because only then
is there hope for a cure.

1241
02:03:15,521 --> 02:03:17,273
I don't understand.

1242
02:03:17,841 --> 02:03:20,639
For so many years,
I've tried to protect you...

1243
02:03:20,801 --> 02:03:23,793
from the impurities
of the outside world.

1244
02:03:24,481 --> 02:03:27,154
But ironically, it is
your friend Mr. Lockhart

1245
02:03:27,281 --> 02:03:28,475
who we have to thank.

1246
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:32,994
You're a woman now.

1247
02:03:35,041 --> 02:03:36,474
But I'm not well.

1248
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:44,994
And I will always be here
to take care of you.

1249
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:20,840
She's awake now.

1250
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:30,394
You made me believe
I could leave here one day.

1251
02:04:36,201 --> 02:04:38,237
Why would anybody wanna leave?

1252
02:07:24,281 --> 02:07:25,430
What is it?

1253
02:07:26,561 --> 02:07:27,561
Come.

1254
02:07:39,321 --> 02:07:40,993
What is this place?

1255
02:07:45,761 --> 02:07:47,717
This is where you began.

1256
02:08:09,361 --> 02:08:10,760
I don't want to.

1257
02:08:17,241 --> 02:08:18,754
You know...

1258
02:08:18,961 --> 02:08:22,351
you look just like she did
on her wedding night.

1259
02:08:27,801 --> 02:08:32,079
The night they took her from me.

1260
02:08:39,361 --> 02:08:41,716
The villagers cut out the fetus

1261
02:08:41,801 --> 02:08:43,393
and threw it in the aquifer.

1262
02:08:44,601 --> 02:08:46,717
The child survived.

1263
02:09:18,121 --> 02:09:19,190
Please don't.

1264
02:09:19,321 --> 02:09:20,470
Don't be frightened.

1265
02:09:20,641 --> 02:09:22,677
Soon we'll be a family again.

1266
02:09:23,761 --> 02:09:25,433
The way we were
always meant to be.

1267
02:09:41,201 --> 02:09:42,521
It's all right.

1268
02:09:42,681 --> 02:09:46,196
My sister was also
somewhat resistant, at first.

1269
02:09:46,361 --> 02:09:50,354
But after a while,
she grew to like it.

1270
02:09:53,481 --> 02:09:57,838
We tried so many times
to make something pure.

1271
02:10:03,881 --> 02:10:05,997
That something was you, my love.

1272
02:10:10,361 --> 02:10:11,396
And now...

1273
02:10:13,401 --> 02:10:14,470
we can begin again.

1274
02:10:45,721 --> 02:10:47,916
I've waited so long.

1275
02:11:05,361 --> 02:11:06,760
So long.

1276
02:11:20,401 --> 02:11:22,596
He will have you. Yes?

1277
02:11:22,761 --> 02:11:24,035
Yes.

1278
02:11:38,761 --> 02:11:40,956
You can't keep her here forever.

1279
02:11:42,881 --> 02:11:43,916
No?

1280
02:11:48,921 --> 02:11:51,121
And what do you think would
become of her in your world?

1281
02:11:52,641 --> 02:11:54,313
People like you
come to me in droves

1282
02:11:54,401 --> 02:11:55,993
with your disposable lives.

1283
02:11:56,841 --> 02:11:58,274
She's your daughter.

1284
02:12:03,441 --> 02:12:05,830
And what have you
ever loved, hmm?

1285
02:12:06,841 --> 02:12:09,230
What have you ever sacrificed?

1286
02:12:12,761 --> 02:12:16,310
This is what the outside world
has to offer.

1287
02:12:33,681 --> 02:12:34,796
You're right.

1288
02:12:38,121 --> 02:12:39,121
No.

1289
02:13:23,401 --> 02:13:24,401
No.

1290
02:14:06,521 --> 02:14:08,352
Fire. Fire!

1291
02:15:11,761 --> 02:15:15,197
Everything I have built
has been for her.

1292
02:15:19,361 --> 02:15:23,673
You think I would let someone
like you destroy that?

1293
02:15:23,881 --> 02:15:25,030
Dad?

1294
02:15:34,201 --> 02:15:35,201
Hannah.

1295
02:17:55,681 --> 02:17:57,751
Magnificent, isn't it?

1296
02:18:08,361 --> 02:18:09,361
Lockhart!

1297
02:18:13,041 --> 02:18:14,440
It's time to go.

1298
02:18:32,881 --> 02:18:34,872
Are you okay?
Jesus Christ.

1299
02:18:36,681 --> 02:18:38,990
Easy, easy.

1300
02:18:39,561 --> 02:18:40,835
Lockhart?

1301
02:18:41,041 --> 02:18:42,394
My God.

1302
02:18:42,841 --> 02:18:44,354
What have you done?

1303
02:18:46,521 --> 02:18:48,318
Where's Pembroke?

1304
02:18:50,001 --> 02:18:51,150
He's gone.

1305
02:18:51,321 --> 02:18:52,913
What do you mean "gone"?

1306
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:55,235
Get in the car.

1307
02:18:59,681 --> 02:19:03,310
You came here
to perform a task, remember?

1308
02:19:03,521 --> 02:19:05,671
Now get in the car.

1309
02:19:09,041 --> 02:19:11,032
Did you hear what I said?

1310
02:19:22,561 --> 02:19:24,279
Have you lost your mind?

1311
02:19:27,761 --> 02:19:29,240
Actually...

1312
02:19:31,441 --> 02:19:33,511
I'm feeling much better.

1313
02:19:38,561 --> 02:19:40,517
Where the hell are you going?

1314
02:19:40,721 --> 02:19:44,111
Lockhart! Lockhart!
