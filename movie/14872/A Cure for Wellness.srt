沒問題
Of course.

60
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,880
人的內在充滿病態
There is a sickness inside us.

61
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,720
就像膽汁竄升喉頭的苦澀味
Rising like the bile that leaves that bitter taste at the back of our throats.

我們否認病態存在
We deny its existence

64
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,170
直到有一天 身體背叛心靈
until one day the body rebels against the mind...

65
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,930
大聲呼喊著 我生病了
and screams out, "I am not a well man."

66
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,210
你當然一心只想著並購的事
No doubt you will think only of the merger.

67
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,180
兩個同等病態公司的齪齪結合
That unclean melding of two equally diseased institutions.

68
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,850
但事實不容忽視
But the truth cannot be ignored.

69
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,890
唯有了解病痛的根源
For only when we know what ails us

70
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,360
才有希望找到療法
can we hope to find the cure.

71

拉克哈先生
Well, Mr. Lockhart...

75
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,810
你怎麼看這封信?
what do you make of that?

76
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,810
他顯然是瘋了
Clearly, he's lost his mind.

77
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,420
跟我們想的一模一樣
Our thoughts exactly.

78
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,610
他去參加兩周水療度假後
Man goes for a two-week spa vacation,

79
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,710
就完全精神崩潰了
and has a complete mental breakdown.

80
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,550
21世紀哪有人還在玩水療這套?
Who the hell takes the waters in the 21 st century anyway?

81
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,490
我想你了解信中有些內客不得外泄
I trust you understand the sensitivity of some of the information in that letter.

82
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
所以這是真的
So it's true.

83
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,900
這類並購會讓我們成為
A merger of this kind will make us...

one of the biggest financial service firms on the Eastern Seaboard.

85
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,900
會議室的每個人都會賺很大
Something that stands to enrich everyone in this room.

86
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,230
包括你在內
Including you.

87
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,740
你的風評不錯
We hear good things.

88
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,640
能處理好雷諾斯的帳戶令人驚討
Your work on the Reynolds account was inspired.

89
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,810
證交委員會肯定會想查公司帳簿
Of course, the SEC will want unfettered access to our books.

90
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,980
不法的地方一定會曝光
Any irregularities are sure to come out.

91
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,530
你該不會以為我們不會發現吧?
You didn't really think we wouldn't find out?

92
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
我不曉得你在說什麼
I don't know what you're talking about.

93
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,460
你以為你變得出新把戲嗎?
You think there's a trick you can pull we haven't tried?

94
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,100
“年度績效報告”

95
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,470
這手法也太粗糙了
This is amateur.

96
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,670
拉克哈先生 能請教一件事嗎?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Lockhart?

97
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,680
你被30公分的黑屌插過屁眼嗎?
You ever have a 12-inch black dick in your ass?

98
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,850
拉克哈先生 牢獄之災
Prison, Mr. Lockhart.

99
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,350
你麻煩大了
You're in a lot of trouble.

100
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,220
若是這樣 你早就把我交給警方了
If that were the case, you would have already turned me in.

101
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,730
所以我猜證交會要抓的是更高層的人
So, my guess is the SEC is after someone a little more senior.

102
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,470
可能是董事會的一員
Someone on the board, perhaps.

103
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,640
或精神狀況明顯不穩定的人
Or someone who's clearly unstable.

104
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,220
我們要你去瑞士帶潘柏先生回來
We'd like you to go to Switzerland and bring Mr. Pembroke back to us.

105
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,480
是這樣的...
You see...

106
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,990
沒有潘柏簽名 並購案就不能完成
the merger cannot go through without Mr. Pembroke signing off...

107
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,930
有特定法律問題要處理
on certain legal matters.

108
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,700
我跟潘柏光生的關係不如莫里斯
I don't have the relationship with Mr. Pembroke that Morris had.

109
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,840
莫里斯去死
Fuck Morris.

110
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,100
莫里斯是好業務、可靠的顧家男人
Now, Morris was a good salesman, dependable family man.

111
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,670
願他的靈魂安息
God rest his soul.

112
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,000
可是他沒有遠見
But he didn't have vision.

113
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,840
總得有人負起責任
Someone has to take responsibility.

114
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,990
賈許 又是我
Josh, it's me again.

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
一個半小時後 日經就結束交易了
In an hour and a half, the Nikkei closes.

116
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,090
你到時將拜恩的股票脫手
When it does, I want you to empty Banyon

117
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,060
買下葛蘭柯的賣權
and buy puts in Glenco.

118
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,500
我現在傳細節給你 快回我電話
I'm sending the details over now. And fucking call me back.

119
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,660
我不喜歡留言
I don't like leaving messages like this.

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,000
你是來治療的嗎?
You're here for the cure?

121
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,170
不是 我只是探訪
No, I'm just visiting.

122
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,740
你不介意吧?
You mind?

123
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,400
你抽吧
Go ahead.

124
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,420
你比我大部分載的客人年輕
You're younger than most of my passengers.

125
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,820
你常替療養院載客嗎?
Do a lot of driving for the sanitarium?

126
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,290
全部是我載的
All the driving.

127
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,830
我每星期都去車站接有錢人
Every week, I pick up rich people from the train...

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
載他們上山
and take them up the mountain.

129
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,920
只帶有錢人嗎?
Only rich people, huh?

130
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,800
這裡一定很貴
Must be expensive.

131
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,340
有錢人有富裕的問題
Well, wealthy people have wealthy problems.

132
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,500
我呢 過著簡單的生活就滿足了
Me, I'm happy with a simple life.

133
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,670
就這樣?你都沒有抱負?
That's it? No ambition?

134
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
光是載人上下山就滿足了?
Just drive people up and down the mountain?

135
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,140
大部分的人會留下來
Most people tend to stay.

136
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,610
為什麼?
Why's that?

137
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,020
我想他們喜歡療養院
I guess they like it there.

138
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,180
靠
Oh, shit.

139
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,180
“電池量 0%”

140
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,280
我不來水療這一套
I don't go in for spas and that kind of thing.

141
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,160
我工作謀生 就跟我爸一樣
I work for a living, like my father before me.

142
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,290
兒子會向父親學習如何當男人吧?
A son learns what it is to be a man from his father. Am I right?

143
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,460
這我就不知道了
I wouldn't know.

144
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,630
我沒有父親陪伴長大
I didn't grow up with my father.

145
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,970
你要去多久?
How long will you be gone?

146
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,970
幾天而已 洽公
Just a few days. It's business.

147
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,980
你的氣色很差
You don't look well.

148
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,840
我沒事 只是最近睡眠不足
I'm fine. I just haven't been sleeping much.

149
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,850
你需要休息
You need to rest.

150
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,580
我老是告訴你爸要休息...
You know, I always told your father to rest...

151
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,690
但他就是不聽
but he wouldn't listen.

152
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,090
他太沒用了
He was weak.

153
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,090
你又不認識他
You didn't know him.

154
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,720
那是誰的錯?
And whose fault is that?

155
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,600
你在這輕還開心嗎?
So, are you happy here?

156
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,210
院方有好好照顧你嗎?
Are they taking good care of you?

157
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,940
人是來這裡等死的 我哪會開心?
People come here to die. Why would I be happy?

158
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,010
我要升官了
I'm getting a promotion.

159
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,110
我回來就能幫你換個好環境
So, when I get back I'll be able to move you to somewhere better.

160
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,280
靠近海灘什麼
Somewhere near the beach or something.

161
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,350
你不會回來的
You won't come back.

162
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,100
我當然會
Of course I will.

163
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,200
又做新的芭蕾舞伶?
Another ballerina?

164
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,200
她跟別的不一樣
She's not like the others.

165
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,640
怎麼說?
Why's that?

166
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,870
她生活在夢境裡
She lives in a dream.

167
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,650
可是她在跳舞
But she's dancing.

168
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,610
那是因為她不知道自己在作夢
That's because she doesn't know she's dreaming.

169
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,100
好友善的一群人
Friendly bunch.

170
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,570
對啊
Yeah.

171
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,850
村民跟山上的人一向不和
There's always been bad blood between the villagers and the people on the hill.

172
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,340
為什麼
Why's that?

173
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,250
舊恨
History.

174
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,130
這個地方歷史多久了?
How old is this place?

175
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,630
地基可回溯到男爵時代
Foundations date back to the time of the barons.

176
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,330
幾百年來 這塊土地跟這裡的人
For centuries, all this land and everyone in it...

177
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,970
都屬於一個家族
belonged to one family.

178
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,630
范海克莫
The Von Reichmerls.

179
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,300
他們怎麼了?
What happened to them?

180
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,670
故事很曲折
Hmm. Interesting story.

181
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,710
最後一任男爵對血脈純淨著了魔
Apparently, the last baron was so obsessed with the purity of his bloodline...

182
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,650
他決定只有親妹才能替他生子
he decided only his sister was clean enough to carry his child.

183
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,820
教會禁止他們結合後 他棄絕了上帝
When the church forbade the union, he renounced God.

184
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,650
下場一定很慘
That must have gone over well.

185
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,650
那還用說
No shit.

186
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,190
在他的新婚之夜
So on his wedding night...

187
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,920
村民上山
the villagers came up the hill...

188
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,100
追著男爵跟新娘進了地下墓穴
chased the Baron and his bride into the catacombs...

189
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,860
讓他眼睜睜看著她被燒死
and made him watch while they burned her alive.

190
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,340
接著他們放火燒了這裡 夷為平地
Then they burned the whole place to the ground.

191
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,610
好可怕的故事
That's a hell of a story.

192
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,340
對啊
Yeah.

193
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,850
但那是兩百年前的事
But that was 200 years ago.

194
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,180
現在情況不一樣了
A lot's changed since then.

195
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,480
我最多待20分鐘就出來
20 minutes max.

196
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,120
不急
No hurry.

197
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,720
歡迎
Welcome!

198
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,960
請問有什麼事?
May I help you?

199
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,970
我來找一個客人 羅蘭潘柏先生
I'm here to see a guest. Mr. Roland Pembroke.

200
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,900
抱歉 今天的探訪時間已經過了
I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for the day.

201
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,840
“探訪時間 11至15點”

202
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,840
我長途跋涉
I've come a long way.

203
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,250
可以破個例嗎?
Maybe you could make an exception.

204
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,010
不能破例
There are no exceptions.

205
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,480
我可以找經理談嗎?
Is there a manager I could speak to?

206
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,090
在這裡簽名
Sign here.

207
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,250
麻煩你
Please.

208
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,100
謝謝...拉克哈先生
Thank you, Mr. Lockhart.

209
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,960
我儘量幫你處理
I'll see what I can do.

210
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,600
這裡沒有訊號
You won't get any service here.

211
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,010
這是療程的一部分
Part of the treatment.

212
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,480
久了就習慣了
You get used to it.

213
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,280
特赦10個字母的寫法是啥?
What's a ten-letter word for amnesty?

214
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,440
不曉得
No idea.

215
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,710
免除
Exemption.

216
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,680
不對 那才9個字母
Nope. That's only nine.

217
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,190
赦免
Absolution.

218
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,320
對
Yes!

219
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,290
你喜歡玩字謎嗎?
You like puzzles?

220
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,850
不喜歡
Not really.

221
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,970
麻煩一下好嗎?
You mind?

222
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,540
謝謝
Thank you.

223
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,620
我想櫃檯的護士解釋過了
I believe the reception nurse explained...

224
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,020
探訪時間到3點整結束
that visiting hours end at 3:00 p.m. precisely.

225
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,700
她是說了 但我想你很清楚
She did. But as I'm sure you're aware...

226
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,420
潘柏依舊是某者要金融機構的總栽
Mr. Pembroke remains the CEO of a major financial institution.

227
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,370
在這種情況下 我希望你能開個...
Under the circumstances, I was hoping you can make an...

228
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,360
特例
exception.

229
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,860
維他命
Vitamins.

230
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,580
如果我們要幫助來這療養的人
If we are to help the people that come here...

231
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,710
就得維持體力
we must keep up our strength.

232
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,950
能請教是哪方面的事嗎?
May one ask what it is concerning?

233
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,550
商業機密
It's a business matter.

234
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,890
我無法多說
I'm not at liberty to say any more than that.

235
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,890
沒間題 我希望你能了解
Of course. And I hope you understand

236
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,090
這裡也有自己的規定
that we also have our rules.

237
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,560
我們的療程想發揮最大的效果
Our treatments here are most effective...

238
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,790
就得嚴格限制接觸現代世界的壓力
when exposure to the stresses of the modern world is strictly limited.

239
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,660
沃莫主任對這點頗為堅持
Director Volmer is quite firm on that.

240
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,830
“純淨健康 亨利沃莫”

241
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,130
水療? -是的
Hydrotherapy? That is correct.

242
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,470
就為了水 這路途還真遠
That's a long way to come just for water.

243
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,430
本遼陽院建於古老的含水土層之上
The sanitarium is built over an ancient aquifer...

244
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,480
富有獨特的活化特質
that offers uniquely rejuvenating qualities.

245
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,180
重建
Rebuilt.

246
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,860
在失火以後
After the fire.

247
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,690
是的
Yes.

248
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,290
歷史充滿黑暗面
History is full of darkness.

249
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,700
如果你想留張字條
If you would like to leave a note...

250
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,770
我會轉交給潘柏先生
I'd happily pass it along to Mr. Pembroke.

251
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,500
彼得森先生?
Mr. Pieterson?

252
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,150
我知道你在這裡的工作很重要
I understand the work you do here is important...

253
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,180
你顯然也是大忙人
and you're obviously a very busy man.

254
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,670
但如果你願意在管理水上有氧運動 與按摩浴缸之餘找時間
But if you wouldn't mind finding time between administering aqua aerobics and Jacuzzis...

255
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,660
通知潘柏先生有訪客
to inform Mr. Pembroke he has a visitor...

256
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,120
有緊急要事找他
with information of the utmost urgency to him personally...

257
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,630
我會很感謝
I'd be grateful.

258
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,460
另一方面 如果你要我寫字條
On the other hand, if you want me to write a note...

259
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,500
好隨同早餐托盤塞進門底下
so you can slip it under his door with his breakfast tray...

260
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,230
他在早上按摩前卻不見得能發現
on the off-chance he notices it before his morning rubdown...

261
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,200
那我恐怕不能接受
I'm afraid that's not gonna cut it.

262
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,740
我跑了六千多公里才到了這裡
You see, I just traveled 4,000 miles to get here.

263
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,640
今晚有班紅眼班機回紐約
There's a red-eye going back to New York tonight...

264
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,470
我會帶潘柏先生飛回去
and I intend Mr. Pembroke and I to be on it.

265
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,080
你打算帶潘柏先生跟你回紐約?
You plan to take Mr. Pembroke back to New York with you?

266
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,660
有問題嗎?
Is that a problem?

267
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,230
這當然完全要看潘柏先生的意思
Of course, it is entirely up to Mr. Pembroke.

268
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,360
他是病患 不是囚犯
He's a patient, not a prisoner.

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,160
他的療程到7點結束
He'll be in treatment until after 7:00.

270
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,830
你到時候來 我一定讓你見他
If you'd like to come back then, I'll make sure he's available.

271
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,000
謝謝你的諒解
Thank you for your understanding.

272
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,880
你這麼快離開?
Leaving already?

273
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,030
好帥氣的年輕人 -你的朋友呢
What a nice-looking young man.  - Where's your friend?

274
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,020
到蘇黎世最末班火車幾點?
What time's the last train to Zurich?

275
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,920
10點
Not till 10:00.

276
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,220
帶我找間旅館 我得打個電話
Get me to a hotel. I gotta make a call.

277
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,720
正妹
Pretty girl.

278
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,000
搞什麼
What the fuck!

279
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,420
你要去多久?
How long will you be gone?

280
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,850
幾天而已
Just a few days.

281
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,120
你有在等人嗎?
Are we waiting for someone else?

282
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,630
沒有人了
There is no one else.

283
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,540
睡得好嗎?
Sleep well?

284
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,920
我印象中沒睡得這麼甜過 -山上的空氣很新鮮
I can't remember having slept better.  - It's the mountain air.

285
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,940
拉克哈先生
Mr. Lockhart...

286
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,510
我是亨利沃莫 療養院的主任
my name is Henrich Volmer. I am the director of the sanitarium here.

287
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,960
我在這裡待多久了?
How long have I been here?

288
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,150
三天
Three days.

289
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,960
老天
Oh, Jesus!

290
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,360
你的運氣很好 骨折沒粉碎
You can count yourself lucky. It was a clean break.

291
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,970
不過我覺得我有部分的責任
Although I do feel partly responsible.

292
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,510
居民說我應該射殺這裡的鹿
The locals tell me I should hunt the deer on the property...

293
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,200
但我沒辦法傷害這些無辜的動物
but I can't bring myself to harm the innocent creatures.

294
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,010
畢竟·它們早就在這裡了
After all, they were here long before us.

295
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,310
我得打電話到紐約
I need to call New York.

296
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,700
我逕行通知貴公司你出車禍的事了 如果你擔心的是這個
I took the liberty of informing your office of the accident, if that's your concern.

297
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,220
他們跟我的意見一致
They agreed with me...

298
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,020
生意可以等 但你的健康不能等
that business can wait and your health cannot.

299
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,860
漢克葛林親口說的?
Hank Green said that?

300
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,160
就連華爾街大金融公司的代理總栽
Even the acting head of a major Wall Street finance firm...

301
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,100
對嚴重車禍的後果也無法爭辯
can't argue with the consequences of a serious car accident.

302
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,830
這裡的訪客不多
We don't get many visitors here.

303
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,900
多數病患都有過豐功偉業
Most of my patients have done extraordinary things.

304
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,280
創造大筆財富
Built vast fortunes...

305
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,420
管理偉大的企業
commanded great empires...

306
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,010
卻付出慘痛代價
but at a terrible cost.

307
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,690
他們沒有人照顧
They have no one who cares for them.

308
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,790
潘柏先生運氣很好
Mr. Pembroke is lucky.

309
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,220
他還有你
He has you.

310
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,850
所以你儘管休息吧
So, do your best to relax.

311
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,360
開心享受
Enjoy yourself.

312
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,930
這裡是瑞士阿爾卑斯山腳
You are at the foot of the Swiss Alps...

313
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,050
世上最美的仙境之一 -你就當作是強制放假吧
one of the most beautiful places in the world. Think of it as an enforced vacation.

314
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,810
但你們美國人不懂得放假的情趣吧?
Although I know you Americans are not so good at vacations, are you?

315
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,480
別忘了 這是山上
And remember, you're at altitude.

316
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,210
適應可能要一段時間
It can take a while to acclimatize...

317
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,390
所以務必要多喝水
so please make sure you drink plenty of water.

318
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,060
相信我·我們會好好照顧你
Believe me, you're in good hands.

319
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,230
你迷路了嗎?
Are you lost?

320
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,170
對
Uh... Yeah.

321
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,740
我想是
I guess so.

322
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,510
你要去那裡?
Where is it you're supposed to be?

323
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,750
我不知道
I don't know.

324
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,140
你的名字?
Name?

325
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,650
潘柏
Pembroke.

326
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,690
羅蘭潘柏
Roland Pembroke.

327
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,950
找到了
Here it is.

328
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,790
潘柏 609房 蒸汽浴
Pembroke. Room 609. Steam bath.

329
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,600
對喔
Of course.

330
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,870
潘柏先生...
Mr. Pembroke...

331
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,010
蒸汽浴要往那邊走
the steam baths are in that direction.

332
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,180
你不能進去
You can't go in there.

333
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,130
要換衣服才行
Not like that.

334
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,310
潘柏?
Pembroke?

335
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,490
您是潘柏先生吧?
It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?

336
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,660
我認識你嗎?
Do I know you?

337
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,530
我是拉克哈 葛林先生派我來的
My name is Lockhart. Mr. Green sent me.

338
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,670
我還以為他們會叫莫里斯來
I thought they'd send Morris.

339
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,200
莫里斯死了
Morris is dead.

340
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,670
心臟病發
Heart attack.

341
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,880
潘柏先生 我是來帶你回紐約的
Mr. Pembroke, I've come to bring you back to New York.

342
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,780
你要我離開這裡?
You want me to leave here?

343
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,360
幾天就好
Just for a few days.

344
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,350
我恐怕辦不到
I'm afraid I can't do that.

345
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,520
為什麼不行?
Why not?

346
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,520
我生病了
I'm not well.

347
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,800
你看起來好好的啊
You look all right to me.

348
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,370
那是因為你視而不見
That's because you are blind.

349
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,740
我從前也這樣
As I was.

350
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,300
但你很快就會明白了
But soon you'll see.

351
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,310
放心吧 這裡的人會好好照顧你
Rest assured, they'll take good care of you here.

352
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,380
我不是病人
I'm not a patient.

353
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,210
你的腿怎麼了?
What happened to your leg?

354
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,710
潘柏先生 紐約的情勢很嚴峻
Mr. Pembroke, the situation in New York is really quite serious.

355
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,550
已經跟我與關了
No longer my concern.

356
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,230
主任要我別掛念事業
The director says I must not involve myself in business matters.

357
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,620
你見過沃莫主任了嗎?
Have you met Director Volmer?

358
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,720
今天早上見了
This morning.

359
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,800
他是很好的人
He is a great man.

360
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,370
心地善良 跟其他醫生不一樣
Kind man. Not like other doctors.

361
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,830
潘柏先生
Mr. Pembroke...

362
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,100
大家對血液走火入魔
This obsession with blood.

363
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,740
他們全搞錯了
You see, they have it all wrong.

364
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,140
你知道身體有65％是水嗎?
Do you know the body is 65% water?

365
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,140
我們的體液必須淨化
It's our fluids that must be purified.

366
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,480
並購有問題的消息走漏了
Word that the merger is in trouble has leaked.

367
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,760
股價因此暴跌 拉克哈?
The share price is in free fall. Lockhart?

368
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,910
你該不會跟亨利拉克哈有關係吧?
You're not any relation to Henry Lockhart, are you?

369
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,150
他是我爸
My father.

370
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,150
你認識他?
You knew him?

371
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,360
我們在同時期創業
We started out together.

372
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,520
他的下場可真凄慘
Terrible, what happened to him.

373
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,770
聽說有個男孩被留在車上
They said there was a boy left in the car.

374
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,610
說真的 我不太記得了
I don't remember much, to be honest.

375
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,110
他不應該受到我們那樣的對待
He didn't deserve what we did to him.

376
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,340
什麼意思? -他是正直的人
What do you mean? He was an honest man.

377
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,020
我們卻把他害慘了
And we destroyed him for it.

378
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,180
每天都有人被弄
Well, people get fucked over every day.

379
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,020
就看你有沒有生存的本事
Either you have what it takes to survive, or you don't.

380
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,860
那我想你有咯
And I suppose you do.

381
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,460
這是你大老遠跑來的原因?
Is that why you came all this way?

382
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,970
為了抱負?
Ambition?

383
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,640
那你就比我們都還要嚴重
Then you have it worse than any of us.

384
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,980
什麼東西?
What's that?

385
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,310
病啊
The sickness.

386
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,980
你爸早在我們之前就看清真相
Your father saw the truth long before the rest of us.

387
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,090
這些努力毫無意義
The pointlessness of the entire endeavor.

388
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,590
大家都做過可怕的事
We've all done terrible things.

389
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,920
可怕的事做太多了
So many terrible things.

390
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,590
交易金額是多少?
What's it trading at?

391
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,130
什麼?
What?

392
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,360
股票的交易金額是多少
The stock! What's it trading at?

393
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,500
星期五收盤時每股8.5塊 -寄生蟲
Eight and a half at close on Friday. Parasites.

394
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,880
現在價格會更低
It'll be lower by now.

395
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,940
潘柏先生 大家都很關心你的健康
We're all concerned for your well-being, Mr. Pembroke.

396
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,140
幾天就好
Just a few days.

397
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,040
部分帳戶出現異常
There are certain irregularities in some of the accounts...

398
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,910
釐清後才能完成並購
that need to be clarified before the merger can be completed.

399
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,050
我想總得有人負起責任
And I suppose someone has to take responsibility.

400
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,210
之類的
Something like that.

401
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,160
那我最好去收拾東西
Then I better get my things.

402
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,170
我需要一輛車載我去車站
I need a car to take me to the station.

403
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,170
你能幫我叫車嗎? -我會儘量幫你處理
Will you call one for me, please? I'll see what I can do.

404
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,140
這是男爵吊死神父的地方
That's where the baron hung the priest.

405
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,150
什麼?-你看
- What's that? - See?

406
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,450
教堂原本在那裡
The church would have been right over there...

407
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,650
現在被這怪建築取代了 我確定
where that funny little building is now. I'm sure of it.

408
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,150
從前的人會遠道而來
People used to come from miles around...

409
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,300
求聖水的神奇功效
for the miracles attributed to the holy water.

410
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,690
我想有些事情是不會變的
Guess some things don't change.

411
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,960
真是了不起
How marvelous.

412
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,330
不過這種暴力實在可怕
Terrible thing, though. Such violence.

413
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,700
娶妹妹就會這樣
That's what you get for marrying your sister.

414
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,190
妹妹? -對 一切都為了血統純淨吧?
Sister? Yeah, it was all about a pure bloodline, wasn't it?

415
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,800
好精彩
How fascinating!

416
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,970
我一定要查一查
I must look into that.

417
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,310
很高興你能走路了
Glad to see you're back on your feet!

418
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,870
我們聽說車禍的事了
We heard about the accident.

419
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,210
你是美國人吧?先生貴姓 -拉克哈
You're American, aren't you, Mister... Lockhart.

420
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,660
法蘭克希爾 斯德哥爾摩人
Frank Hill. Stockholm.

421
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,820
這是倫敦來的奈爾先生
And this is Mr. Nair from London.

422
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,220
我原本住在孟買
Bombay, originally.

423
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,380
你見到業餘歷史學者瓦金斯太太了 -沒錯 我真沒禮貌
I see you've met Mrs. Watkins, our amateur historian. Yes, of course. How rude.

424
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,640
維多莉亞瓦金斯 我在全錄待了40年 -你拉張椅子坐吧?
Victoria Watkins. 40 years at Xerox. Why don't you pull up a chair?

425
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,100
我們三缺一
We need a fourth.

426
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,200
小心 他像波羅門的人一樣會作弊
Careful. Like most Brahmins, he cheats.

427
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,000
從創投家的口中說出這句話
Coming from a venture capitalist,

428
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,670
我當是恭維
I take that as a compliment.

429
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,510
其實 我準備跟潘柏先生一起回紐約
Actually, I was just on my way back to New York with Mr. Pembroke.

430
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,010
那麼他...
Then he's...

431
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,080
他的身體好點了?
He's feeling better?

432
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,180
夠好了
Well enough.

433
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,520
我想這是好消息
I suppose that's wonderful news.

434
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,960
奈爾先生 可不是嗎?
Isn't that right, Mr. Nair?

435
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,300
很好的消息
Wonderful news.

436
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,700
瓦金斯太太
Mrs. Watkins...

437
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,230
你該做療程了
time for your treatment.

438
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,530
沒問題
Yes, of course.

439
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,370
拉克哈先生 很高興認識你
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lockhart.

440
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,740
一路平安
Safe travels.

441
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,620
水裡有東西嗎?
Something in the water?

442
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,290
在水底
At the bottom.

443
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,530
我什麼都看不到
I don't see anything.

444
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,000
會痛嗎?
Did it hurt?

445
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,670
我不記得了
Can't remember.

446
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,680
這樣反而好
Better that way.

447
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,120
我有看到你
I saw you.

448
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,350
之前看到過
Before.

449
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,510
你是這裡的病人嗎?
Are you a patient here?

450
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,360
你比其他人都年輕很多
It's just, you're so much younger than everyone else.

451
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,300
沃莫主任說我是特殊案例
Director Volmer says I'm a special case.

452
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,230
那你呢?
What about you?

453
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,710
你是來接受治療的嗎?
Are you here for the cure?

454
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,340
不是
No.

455
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,070
其實我正要離開
Actually, I was just leaving.

456
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,650
沒人離開過這裡
No one ever leaves.

457
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,650
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

458
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,650
為什麼有人會想要離開?
Why would anyone want to?

459
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,230
我懂你的意思
Yeah, I see your point.

460
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,030
你來的目的達到了嗎?
Did you get what you came for?

461
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,570
我來帶一個人回紐約
Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.

462
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,700
所以我的目的達到了
So, yeah. I did.

463
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,510
他想走嗎?
Does he want to go?

464
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,020
不太想
Not really.

465
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,530
你剛剛哼唱那首歌
That song you were singing.

466
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,090
是在哪裡學的?
Where did you learn that?

467
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,940
我得走了
I have to go now.

468
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,380
你叫什麼名字?
What's your name?

469
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,220
漢娜
Hannah.

470
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,000
“今細探訪時間已過”

471
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,630
潘柏先生?
Mr. Pembroke?

472
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,770
潘柏呢?
Where's Pembroke?

473
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,710
原本在這間病房的人去哪了?
The patient that was in this room, where is he?

474
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,010
我還以為你是潘柏
I thought you were Pembroke.

475
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,860
大家知道從前胃痛的建議療法嗎?
Do you know what they used to recommend for the common stomach ailment?

476
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,130
使用水蛭
The application of leeches.

477
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,740
根據診斷 我一向同情水蛭
Based on the diagnosis, I always pitied the leech.

478
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:17,640
拉克哈先生...
Mmm. Mr. Lockhart...

479
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,330
請加入我們吧
please, won't you join us?

480
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,880
鱘魚很好吃 你愛鹿肉也行
The sturgeon is excellent, unless of course you prefer the venison.

481
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,810
我不能浪費那頭鹿
I couldn't let it go to waste.

482
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,080
潘柏呢?
Where's Pembroke?

483
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,520
很不幸 潘柏先生病情加重了
Mr. Pembroke has unfortunately taken a turn for the worse.

484
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,160
恐怕你們談生意的事
I fear your conversation about business matters...

485
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,020
讓他的情況惡化了
has set him back somewhat.

486
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,090
但不重要
But, no matter. We have moved him on

487
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,320
我們送他去做下一階段的療程了
to the next stage of treatment.

488
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,730
我覺得他看來好好的
He looked all right to me.

489
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,190
但你不是醫生
But you're not a doctor.

490
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,360
說不定該徵求第二意見了
Maybe it's time for a second opinion.

491
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,700
要走要留就看潘柏先生的意思
That, of course, is up to Mr. Pembroke.

492
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,500
但他不能見客
And he's not available.

493
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,330
自從我來了以後
Ever since I got here...

494
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,500
你們就一跟我兜圈子
you people have been giving me the runaround.

495
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,510
請你降低音量
I would ask you please to keep your voice down.

496
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,840
我們可不想讓客戶不開心吧
We wouldn't wanna upset the clientele, would we?

497
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,780
拉克哈先生
Mr. Lockhart, giving you the runaround

498
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,850
我並沒有跟你兜圈子
is the furthest thing from my mind.

499
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,280
我只關心我病患的福利
My sole concern is for the welfare of my patients.

500
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,890
病人開始好轉就會影響你們的生意
It's bad for business if people start getting better.

501
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,620
我說得對嗎?
Am I right?

502
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,620
拉克哈先生 你的言下之意是什麼?
What are you implying, Mr. Lockhart?

503
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,230
老人花大錢做什麼?喝水?
Old people paying through the teeth for what? Water?

504
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,920
你的開銷到底是多少?
What's your overhead anyway?

505
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,690
那不關你的事
That is not your concern.

506
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,700
我不想把律師牽扯進來
I don't wanna have to get lawyers involved...

507
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,700
但我是來帶潘柏回紐約的
but I came to get Pembroke back to New York...

508
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,340
我要把人帶走 就算我得敲破他的頭
and that's what I'm gonna do, if I have to hit him over his head...

509
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,440
揪著頭髮把他抱出去也在所不辭
and drag him out by his hair.

510
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,220
拉克哈先生 你還好嗎?你的臉色很蒼白
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Lockhart? You seem pale.

511
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,920
我沒事
I'm fine.

512
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,420
你流血了
You're bleeding.

513
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,780
什麼?
What?

514
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,440
你還是坐下來吧
Perhaps you should sit down.

515
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,790
沒有腦震盪跡拿
No signs of concussion.

516
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,500
你會頭痛、出現幻覺嗎?
Any headaches, hallucinations?

517
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,130
沒有
No.

518
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,170
你可以穿衣服了
You may dress.

519
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,670
你有在喝水嗎?
Are you drinking the water?

520
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:33,500
有
Yes.

521
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,940
很好
Good.

522
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,310
一定要喝水
Make sure you do.

523
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,110
我在車禍後擅自替你做了幾項檢查
I took the liberty of running a few tests after the accident.

524
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,220
漢娜
Hannah.

525
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,220
這是她吧?
Isn't it?

526
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,950
對
Yes.

527
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,290
她是特殊案例
She's a very special case.

528
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,450
什麼意思?
What does that mean exactly?

529
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,700
她小時候遭遇嚴重的創傷
She was exposed to serious trauma when she was very young.

530
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,700
她的發育遲緩
Her development was delayed.

531
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,700
直到11歲才開口說話
Hannah did not utter a word until she was 11 years old.

532
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,470
請你要了解
Please understand...

533
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,010
拉克哈先生...
Mr. Lockhart...

534
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,640
她對我來說 情同女兒
she is like a daughter to me.

535
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,650
但我們要討論的是你的事
But we're here to discuss you.

536
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,490
你的體液不平衡
An imbalance in your fluids.

537
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,650
重大器官損傷
Strain to the major organs.

538
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,590
免疫系統耗竭
Depleted immune system.

539
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,930
許多跡象指出你跟多數病患一樣
Many indicators that you have in common with most of my patients...

540
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,500
但我坦承從來沒看過
but I will confess I have never seen a case...

541
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,040
這麼嚴重的病情
as advanced as this...

542
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,900
發生在這麼年輕的人身上
in someone so young.

543
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,680
是嗎?
Is that right?

544
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,280
拉克哈先生 告訴我
Tell me, Mr. Lockhart...

545
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,350
你最後一次覺得身強體壯是何時?
when was the last time that you actually felt well?

546
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,350
在你來之前
Before you came here, when was the last time...

547
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,860
你最後一次一覺到天亮是何時?
that you even slept through the night?

548
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,730
心理可能會說謊
The mind may lie...

549
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,720
但身體可騙不了人
but the body cannot.

550
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,230
我想幫助你
I should like to help you.

551
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,430
本院提供的是
What we offer here...

552
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,600
簡單的淨化過程

553
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,140
遠離現代世界的壓力

554
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,110
回歸單純的年代
A return to a simpler time.

555
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,910
潘柏先生一兩天內不能出遠門
Mr. Pembroke will not be ready to travel for a day or two.

556
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,980
你願意的話
And if you're willing...

557
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,710
我想推薦一個療程
I would like to recommend a treatment.

558
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,050
我能跟當班的護士說
I can speak to the duty nurse...

559
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,720
今天晚上就能開始進行
and we may be able to start as early as this evening.

560
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,890
你覺得有必要就做吧
If you think it's necessary.

561
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,290
很好
Good.

562
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,100
葛瑞塔
Greta?

563
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,070
葛瑞塔?
Greta?

564
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,300
“羅蘭潘柏”

565
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,110
拉克哈先生 你的運氣真好
You're in luck, Mr. Lockhart.

566
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,960
我們能馬上幫你安排
We can get you in right away.

567
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,680
“VR”
"VR."

568
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,820
范海克莫的意思
Von Reichmerl.

569
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,330
這是重建時發現的
It was found during the reconstruction.

570
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,130
那這就是男爵的墜子咯?
Then it belong to the baron?

571
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,530
其實是男爵夫人的
The baroness, actually.

572
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,640
凡妮莎范海克莫
Vanessa Von Reichmerl.

573
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,470
她體弱多病
She was sickly.

574
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,310
男爵執意要找到療法
The Baron was obsessed with finding a cure.

575
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,870
事實上 他是第一個
It was he, in fact, who first discovered

576
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,110
發現這裡的水有療效
the medicinal properties of our water.

577
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,680
他無所不用其極
He sacrificed everything.

578
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,290
他一定很愛她
He must have loved her very much.

579
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,960
是的
Yes.

580
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,170
當妹妹一樣愛
Like a sister.

581
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,800
歷史以道德角度批判他當然是對的
History is right, of course, to judge him on moral grounds.

582
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,210
但身為科學之人
But, as a man of science...

583
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,310
我對他只有欣賞
I can't help but admire him.

584
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,980
當班護士會帶你去隔離區
The duty nurse will escort you to our isolation wing.

585
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,480
謝謝
Thank you.

586
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,650
拉克哈先生
Mr. Lockhart...

587
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,820
希望你不會介意
If you wouldn't mind.

588
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,430
這樣我們才能監控你的進展
Just so we can keep an eye on your progress.

589
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,020
“維多莉亞瓦金斯”

590
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,390
拉克哈先生 您準備好了嗎?
Are you ready, Mr. Lockhart?

591
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,400
那我們開始吧
Then let us begin.

592
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,680
地球的生物首先從水中出現
Life on this planet first came from water.

593
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,590
我們頭九個月沉浸在液體中
We spend the first nine months of our existence submerged...

594
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,120
身體多數為液體所組成
our bodies mostly liquid.

595
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,290
感官去除室能模擬
This sensory deprivation chamber simulates a return...

596
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,460
讓人回歸胚胎狀態
to that embryonic state.

597
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,600
就當成是淨化心靈...
Think of it as a cleansing of the mind...

598
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,360
與淨化身體吧
as much as the body.

599
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,600
有些病患會心跳加速
Some patients experience increased heart rate...

600
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,180
出現幻覺
visions...

601
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,320
甚至出現早期記憶
even primal memories.

602
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,180
但請放...這只是毒素排出體外
But rest assured, it's just the toxins leaving the system.

603
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,360
完全投入這個過程
Give yourself over completely to the process...

604
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,690
你就會看到成果
and you will see the results.

605
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,960
注意看好他
Keep a close eye on him.

606
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,120
好的
Yes, sir.

607
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,940
拉克哈先生 療程總共30分鐘
Mr. Lockhart... the treatment lasts 30 minutes.

608
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,480
我會從這裡監控 有任何問題
I'll be monitoring you from here. If you have any issues...

609
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,480
此敲水槽
just tap on the side of the tank.

610
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,850
退後
Get back!

611
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,140
過去五天 股市完全崩盤
In the last five days, a total collapse.

612
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,110
道瓊指數狂跌超過508點
The Dow plunging over 508 points...

613
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,610
華爾街彌漫著恐慌
as panic spread throughout Wall Street...

614
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,210
有超過三分之一的獲利
wiping out more than one-third of the gains...

615
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,110
從這罕見的五年牛市蒸發
from this rare, five-year bull market.

616
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,910
其中超過一半發生於單一交易日
More than half of that in a single trading day.

617
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,880
紐約證交所主席約翰菲蘭
Chairman of New York Stock Exchange, John Phelan...

618
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,080
試圖安定投資人信心
tried to reassure investors.

619
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,390
爸
Dad?

620
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,000
爸
Dad!

621
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,510
拉克哈先生 你沒事吧?
Mr. Lockhart, are you all right?

622
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,670
放開我
Get off me.

623
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:15,950
別激動
Try to stay calm.

624
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,420
很抱歉 儀器一定出了問題
I'm terribly sorry. Something must have gone wrong with the machine.

625
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,960
水裡有東西
There's something in the water.

626
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,030
水裡他媽的有東西
There's something in the fucking water.

627
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,710
拉克哈先生 水裡沒東西
There is nothing in the water, Mr. Lockhart.

628
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,790
可是我看到了
But I saw them.

629
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,190
主任解釋過了
As the Director explained...

630
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,490
這套療程會使某些病患出現幻覺
some patients experience visions with this particular treatment.

631
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,140
這只是毒素排出體外
Just the toxins leaving the body.

632
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,300
是療程的一部分
It's all part of the cure.

633
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,800
你得休息了
You need to rest now.

634
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,640
我扶你回去房間
I will help you to your room.

635
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,180
逮到你了
Got you.

636
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,010
拉克哈 早
Morning, Lockhart.

637
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,950
你好點了嗎?
Feeling better?

638
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,990
要一起吃早餐嗎?
Joining us for breakfast?

639
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,630
鱈魚咖哩飯很香
The kedgeree is excellent.

640
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,200
我不餓
I'm not hungry.

641
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,990
你可得好好保持體力
You must keep up your strength.

642
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,510
瓦金斯太太?
Mrs. Watkins?

643
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,870
教堂的原址...
That building where the church used to be...

644
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,810
現在的用途是什麼?
What's it used for now?

645
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,820
我也不曉得
I couldn't say.

646
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,980
男爵跟他妹妹的事你說對了
You were right about the baron and his sister.

647
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,090
但那不是村民燒了這裡的源因
But that's not the reason the villagers burned the place down.

648
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,190
而是實驗的關係
It was on account of the experiments.

649
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,150
某種醫學實驗
Some sort of medical experiments.

650
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,060
“男爵夫人 范海克莫 凡妮莎 實臉”

651
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:19,990
“屍體 妹妹 神父 婚禮 大火”

652
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,000
他用自己的人民當白老鼠
Apparently performed on his own peasants.

653
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,730
有些人失蹤了
People went missing.

654
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,990
後來
And then...

655
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,540
在1814年...
Im Jahre 1814...

656
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:33,010
農夫在耕田時發現死人
farmers, tilling their fields, stumbled on human bodies...

657
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,410
遭到破壞且皮包骨
disfigured and emaciated.

658
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:39,350
就像埃及木乃伊一樣
Dried up like the mummies of Egypt.

659
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,420
他在找療法
He was looking for a cure.

660
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,420
療法? -為了治療男爵夫人
- A cure? - For the baroness.

661
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,020
她病了
She was sick.

662
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,020
我了解了
Oh, I see.

663
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,590
“療法”

664
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,860
我就知道你喜歡字謎
I knew you liked puzzles.

665
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,370
果然沒錯
Of course.

666
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,190
瓦金斯太太
Mrs. Watkins...

667
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,270
你該做療程了
time for your treatment.

668
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,470
你確定嗎?
Are you certain?

669
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,480
我早上才做過一次 我確定
I just had one this morning. I'm sure of it.

670
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,710
時間表上有你
I have you on the schedule.

671
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,450
我今天一定是有問題
I must not be feeling myself today.

672
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:23,950
這裡黑暗又邪惡
There is a terrible darkness here.

673
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,950
這是什麼地方?
What is this place?

674
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,960
抱歉 我不懂
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

675
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,650
我看到你跟一個病人在一起
I thought I saw you with a patient.

676
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,290
不是 病人
No. Patient.

677
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,130
好
Okay.

678
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,300
謝謝
Thank you.

679
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,210
你要去游泳嗎?
Going for a swim?

680
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,990
我不能游
I'm not supposed to.

681
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,450
怎麼說?
Why's that?

682
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:34,830
因為我生病了
On the account of my condition.

683
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,630
我還以為水會讓病情好轉
Thought the water made you better.

684
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,670
跟你說過了 我是特殊案例
Told you. I'm a special case.

685
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,630
對
Right.

686
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,300
從這裡到鎮上有多遠?
How far is it to town?

687
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,510
我想有幾公里吧
A few miles, I think.

688
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,190
你要一路走過去嗎?
Are you going to walk all the way?

689
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,590
除非你想借我腳踏車
Unless you wanna lend me your bike.

690
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:07,420
你要拿什麼來謝我?
What will you give me?

691
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,840
這原本是我媽的
It was my mother's.

692
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,860
她的眼睛閉著
Her eyes are closed.

693
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,090
對 她在作夢·只是她不知道
Yeah, she's dreaming. She just doesn't know it.

694
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:46,200
她醒過來會怎樣?
What happens if she wakes up?

695
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,630
我不知道
I don't know.

696
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,600
我媽一在沒有說到結局
My mother never finished the story.

697
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,640
所以我們說定了嗎?
So, we got a deal?

698
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,310
你要怎麼騎車?
How will you ride it?

699
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,890
你可以一起來啊
Maybe you could come along.

700
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,620
我不能出去
I'm not supposed to.

701
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,590
你一向這麼聽話嗎?
You always do what you're supposed to do?

702
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:22,700
沒關係
It's okay.

703
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,170
要來嗎?
Coming?

704
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,420
你要喝啤酒嗎?
Want a beer or something?

705
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,690
我不知道 我要嗎?
I don't know. Do I?

706
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,120
我不知道你想要什麼
I don't know what you want.

707
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,020
好 你喝我就喝
All right. If you're having one.

708
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:39,700
你還在這裡?
Still here?

709
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,210
我以為你只走訪客
Thought you were just visiting.

710
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,040
你看起來好多了
You've looked better.

711
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,220
你也是
Same to you.

712
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,280
你的車子還好嗎?
How's the car?

713
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,390
我的車全毀了
That car was a piece of shit.

714
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,620
療養院賠的錢夠我買一輛新車
Sanitarium offered me enough to buy a new one.

715
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,120
所以 謝天謝地
So, gracias a Dios.

716
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,460
事出必有因 對嗎?
Everything happens for a reason, right?

717
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:01,960
你喝太多了
You drink too much.

718
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,900
你可別開車
I hope you're not driving.

719
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,430
你們兩個是從山上來的?
You two are from up on the hill?

720
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:11,470
對
That's right.

721
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,800
這裡不常有病人下來
We don't get many patients down here.

722
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,780
這些小孩心地善良
Good kids at heart.

723
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,360
只是沒教好
Just weren't raised properly.

724
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,450
不尊重傳統
No respect for tradition.

725
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,760
你知道鎮上有醫生嗎?
Know if there's a doctor in town?

726
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,530
醫生全都在山上了
All the doctors are up on the hill.

727
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,190
有藥師嗎?
A pharmacist?

728
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,930
之類的人?
Something like that?

729
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,540
可以找彼特 繞過去就到了
There's Pieter. Over the road.

730
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,700
他是醫生嗎?
He a doctor?

731
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,610
夠接近了
Close enough.

732
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,830
你不喜歡?
Don't you like it?

733
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,040
不喜歡
No.

734
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:18,180
怎麼 這輩子沒喝過啤酒?
What, you never had a beer before?

735
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,520
你待在療養院多久了?
How long have you been at the sanitarium?

736
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,980
從我有記憶以來
Since I can remember.

737
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,650
那你的家人呢?
What about your family?

738
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,320
我媽在我小時候被火燒死了
My mother died in a fire when I was young.

739
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,720
沃莫主任說等我好一點
Director Volmer says that my father will come for me

740
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:39,660
我爸就會來接我
when I'm better.

741
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:42,590
他會來看你嗎?
Does he visit?

742
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,700
等我好一點他就會來
He'll come when I'm better.

743
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,670
維他命? -對
- Vitamins? - Mmm-hmm.

744
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,180
我可以試試嗎?
Can I try?

745
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,110
好
Okay.

746
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,190
味道像臭海鮮
Tastes like sweaty seafood.

747
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,930
你最後會習慣的
You get used to it. Eventually.

748
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,640
你在這裡待一下沒關係吧?
Will you be okay here for a few minutes?

749
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,640
我得去處理一件事 不會太久
I just have to go see about something. But I won't be long.

750
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,140
好啊
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

751
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,170
哈囉
Hello?

752
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,790
你知道這裡有醫生嗎?
Do you know if there's a doctor here?

753
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,130
你畫的是什麼?
What's that you're drawing?

754
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,790
他不會跟你說話的
He won't talk to you.

755
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:29,970
他不會說話
Doesn't know how.

756
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,710
那是城堡...
That's the castle...

757
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,640
失火的時候
when they burned it down.

758
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,210
這是我孫子威莫許
My grandson, Wilmosh.

759
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,650
他喜歡鬼故事
He likes ghost stories.

760
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,450
你有什麼事?
What can I do for you?

761
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,100
你可以幫我看一下 這份病歷上面寫什麼嗎?
Could you take a look at this, tell me what it says?

762
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,290
這是人的嗎?
Human?

763
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,660
對
That's right.

764
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:54,960
不是我的專業
Not my line.

765
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,190
我願意付你錢
I'll pay you.

766
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:01,970
這樣是多少錢?
How much is this?

767
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,140
沒多少
Not much.

768
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,350
但是夠了
But enough.

769
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,840
你有棉條嗎?
Got a tampon?

770
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,520
我朋友的大姨媽來了
My friend's time of the month.

771
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:58,790
怪胎
Freak.

772
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,520
所以他能出遠門嗎?
So is he fit to travel?

773
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:03,370
他生病了
He's not a well man.

774
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:05,630
有些是牙科的病歷吧?
Some of those are dental records, aren't they?

775
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,960
對 -那是什麼意思?
- That's right. - What do they mean?

776
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,070
他在掉牙齒
His teeth are falling out.

777
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,540
可能的病因是什麼?
What could cause something like that?

778
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,780
撇開先前的病不說 我認為是...
Barring any pre-existing condition, I'd say...

779
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,780
慢性脫水
chronic dehydration.

780
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,320
脫水?
Dehydration?

781
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,320
山上的人都只會喝水而已啊
All they do up there is drink water.

782
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,730
我不是醫生
I'm not a doctor.

783
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,130
抱歉 我還有事...
Now, if you'll excuse me...

784
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,820
等一下
Wait a second.

785
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,730
男爵的實臉
The baron's experiments.

786
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,560
有人在田裡發現屍體 對嗎?
They found bodies in the fields, right?

787
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,640
跟木乃伊一樣
Dried up like mummies.

788
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,670
說不定事情有關聯
Maybe there's some kind of connection.

789
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:48,760
兩百年前 男爵在新婚之夜 就被活活燒死了
The baron was burned alive on his wedding night 200 years ago.

790
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,410
對 但這是現在的事
Yeah, but this is happening now.

791
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,810
人們會來這裡治療
People come here for the cure.

792
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,980
男爵就是要找療法 他的夫人病了
That's what the baron was looking for. His wife was sick.

793
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,590
她沒生病
She wasn't sick.

794
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,820
她是不能生育
She was infertile.

795
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,650
他們努力了很多年
They tried for years.

796
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,480
但男爵夫人都半途流產
But the baroness could not carry a child to term.

797
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,180
大家說她的身體
They say her body rejected the fetuses

798
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,480
因為胎兒畸形產生排斥
because they were deformed.

799
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,150
抱歉 我真的有事
Now, you must excuse me.

800
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:11,660
我得了結這頭牛的痛苦
I have to put this animal out of its misery.

801
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:16,860
它怎慶了?
What's wrong with it?

802
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:20,160
他溜達去不該去的地方
Wandered off where it wasn't supposed to be.

803
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,740
摔斷了腿
Broke its leg.

804
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:23,900
就像你一樣
Like you.

805
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,180
我發現它困在排水溝
Found it trapped in a drainage ditch...

806
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,350
喝臭溝水
drinking sewage water.

807
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,690
我得打一通長途電話
I need to make a phone call. Long distance.

808
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,120
信用卡拿來
Your credit card.

809
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:37,210
拉克哈
Lockhart.

810
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,470
葛林先生
Mr. Green.

811
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,010
你到底去哪了?
Where the hell have you been?

812
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,470
我有一個問題
I have a question.

813
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,640
潘柏有任何舊疾嗎?
Did Pembroke have any pre-existing conditions?

814
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:44,800
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

815
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:48,470
他來之前有生什麼病嗎?
Before he got here. Any medical conditions? Was he sick?

816
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:49,850
沒有 他是保健狂
No. The guy is a fucking health nut.

817
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:52,180
會喝甘藍汁那種神經病
Drank kale for Christ's sake.

818
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,090
到底是怎麼回事?
Now what the fuck is going on?

819
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,990
你四天前就該回來的
You were supposed to be here four days ago.

820
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,650
對 可是後來我出意外了
Yeah. But there was an accident.

821
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:58,480
什麼意外?
What accident?

822
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,530
什麼?
What?

823
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:03,430
我不懂 他們說有打電話給你
I don't understand. They said they called you.

824
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:05,230
沒人打給我
Nobody called.

825
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,100
你確定嗎?
Are you sure about that?

826
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,210
拉克哈 我得跟你重申
Lockhart, do I have to reiterate to you...

827
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:17,350
你出這趟差的重要性嗎?
the importance of what you've been sent there to do?

828
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,780
24小時內帶潘柏上飛機
Get Pembroke on a plane within the next 24 hours...

829
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:22,110
否則這裡就天下大亂了
or this whole place goes ass over tits.

830
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,580
連你也一樣遭殃 懂嗎?
And you with it. Understand me?

831
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:28,680
拉克哈?
Lockhart?

832
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,020
拉克哈
Lockhart!

833
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,430
我有話跟你說 -喂...
- I need to speak with you - Hey, hey, hey.

834
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,190
你說沒人會離開這裡是啥意思?
You said no one ever leaves. What does that mean?

835
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:39,200
你弄痛我了
You're hurting me.

836
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:41,200
他們會怎樣? -拜託放開我
- What happens to them? - Please let me go.

837
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:42,740
院方為什麼不讓我見潘柏?
Why won't they let me see Pembroke?

838
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,700
你知道內幕 對不對? -不知道
You know something, don't you? No.

839
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,470
這是什麼?你為什麼是特殊案例?
What is this stuff? What makes you special?

840
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,110
阿道失 滾開
Fuck off, Adolf!

841
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,910
嘿
Hey!

842
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,280
快點 -不
- Come on. - No!

843
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,220
我付了錢跳這支舞 -不
- I paid for this dance. - No!

844
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,290
放開她
Let her go!

845
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:00,580
跋腳的滾回療養院吧
Go back to the sanitarium, cripple.

846
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:01,890
不
No!

847
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:04,590
不 拜託住手
No! Please, stop!

848
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:07,160
我不是病人

01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:15,820
漢娜
Hannah.

851
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,130
她或許有女人的外表
She may look like a woman...

852
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,140
但她的內心只是個孩子
but she's just a child.

853
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,170
拉克哈先生 無知...
Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart...

854
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,500
是科學的大敵

855
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:32,640
我要見潘柏

你會見到的
And you will.

857
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:48,660
拉克哈先生 你來不來?
Coming, Mr. Lockhart?

858
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,030
什麼事也沒發生
Nothing happened.

859
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,830
那是因為我及時趕到

拉克哈連自己都照顧不了
Mr. Lockhart is not able to look after himself,

864
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:03,440
更何況是照顧你

865
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,410
他不像我可以保護你
He can't protect you the way I can.

866
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,180
我不需要保護 -你當然需要

867
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:11,350
我們只是出去玩
We were just having fun.

868
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:13,850
他跟別人不一樣
He's not like the others.

869
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,290
他很年輕
He's young.

870
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:22,420
幹嘛?
What?

871
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,230
怎麼了? -沒事
- What is it? - Nothing.

872
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,420
讓我看 -不要

什麼時候?

我叫你過來
I said, come here.

881
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,810
一直都是我照顧你的吧?
Now, haven't I always looked after you?

882

你很快就會好轉

然後我爸就會來了?
And my father will come?

885
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,320
對
Yes.

886
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,090
小寶貝 休息吧
Get some rest, my little lamb.

887
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,810
有事嗎?
Bitte?

888

潘柏呢?
Where's Pembroke?

895
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,330

院方把他移走了 他在下面這區

01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,020
實驗...

村民燒死她之前

913
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:04,480
把胎兒挖出來
the villagers cut out the fetus...

914
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,480
扔進含水土層裡
and threw it in the aquifer.

915

Mr. Lockhart...

不管我走到哪裡
every time I turn around,

923
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:28,150
你總是在不該去的地方
you're somewhere you're not supposed to be.

924
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,150
我想我迷路了

This is a restricted floor. There are signs everywhere.

927
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:39,200
你不是不小心撞進來的吧?
Surely you didn't just wander down here by accident?

928
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,830
你到底在找什麼?

其實 我感覺好多了

932
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:54,510
麻煩你告訴我怎麼回房間
If you could just point me in the direction of my room.

933
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,170
別胡說
Nonsense.

934
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,840
我們可不能讓你感染了
We can't let you get an infection.

935

你一定要讓我們照顧你

936

畢竟...
After all...

937
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,110
這是你來療養院的原因
that's why you're here.

病人的牙齒健康都由布南醫生負責

對不起
I'm sorry.

940
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,620
漢娜的事是我不對

告訴我...
Tell me...

943
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:51,130
你去鎮上做什麼?
what were you doing in town?

944
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,000
只是喝啤酒
Just having a beer.

945
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,680

01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,270
放開我
Get your hands off me!

947
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:07,150
拉克哈先生 這是為了你的安全著想

948
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:11,350
本院不相信化學麻醉
We don't believe in chemical anesthesia at the institute.

949
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,450
它的雜質會抑制療效
The impurities inhibit the cure.

950
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:17,750
但你會發現只要焦點對了
But, you will find that with a proper focus...

951
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,620
心理就能克服所有的痛苦
the mind can overcome any amount of pain.

952
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:28,930
拉克哈先生 懷抱信任吧
Trust, Mr. Lockhart. Hmm?

953
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,440
如果我們不能彼此信任
I mean, if we can't trust each other...

954
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:39,150
我又怎麼幫得了你呢?
then how can I help you?

955
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:57,860
阿伯莫太太...
Mrs. Abramov...

956
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:00,700
很高興你來了

我可能帶太多行李了
I probably overpacked.

960
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:06,800
沒有的事
Nonsense.

961
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:11,710
在本院時間之飛快會讓你驚訝的
You'll be surprised how time just slips away here at the institute.

962
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:21,690
快開車

963
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,990
你的臉怎麼了? -開車就對了
What happened to your face? Just drive!

964
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:33,160
他們壓住我 硬拔表的牙齒

965
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,330
他們威脅我
They threatened me.

966
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:37,100
他們為什麼要這麼做?
Why would they do that?

967
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:40,500
因為我知道他們的勾當
Because I know what they've done.

968
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:45,900
有個房間全部都是屍體 像標本一樣在水缸裡漂浮
There is a room full of bodies floating in tanks like specimens.

969
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:50,940
這可是非常嚴重的指控
These are very serious allegations.

970
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,510
沒錯
No shit.

01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,090
沃莫醫師受人尊敬
Director Volmer is a well-respected man.

972
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:59,350
療養院對地方經濟舉足輕重
The sanatorium is of great importance for the local economy.

973
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:01,960
載我上去 我帶你去看
Take me up there, and I'll show you what I saw.

974
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:06,700
你身上有帶證件嗎?
Do you have any identification on you?

975
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:09,530
沒有 都被他捫扣走了
No, they have everything.

976
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:11,760
那麼我可以跟誰談話
Well, then, is there someone I could speak to...

977
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,810
證實你的身分?你有家人嗎?
who might confirm you are who you say you are? Family?

978
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:18,270
希望你能諒解查證你身分的必要性
I hope you understand the need to verify your identity.

979
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,710
你可以打到我的辦公室
You can call my office.

980
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:24,720
好
All right.

981
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,660
你要喝咖啡或茶嗎?
Can I get you coffee or tea?

982
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,590
你有酒嗎?
You got anything stronger?

983
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,120
當然有
Of course.

984
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,160
放心吧
Rest assured...

985
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,470
我們會查個水落石出
we will get to the bottom of this.

986
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,340
謝謝
Thank you.

987
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:49,800
拉克哈先生 我們一直在擔心你
Mr. Lockhart, we've been worried about you.

988
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:51,300
不要過來
Stay away from me!

989
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:52,460
他是你們的病人嗎?
Is this man a patient of yours?

990
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,630
沒錯
Yes, that's right.

991
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:56,300
我不是病人·我是出了意外
I'm not a patient. I was in an accident.

992
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,850
你簽了住院表了 我有帶來
You signed the admission form. I have it right here.

993
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,140
狗屁
That's bullshit.

994
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,510
記得我警告過你可能會出現幻覺吧
I did warn you about possible delusions, remember?

995
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:06,660
那是毒素排出體外的副作用
A side effect of the toxins leaving the body.

996
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,690
那我的腿是幻覺嗎?
And my leg, is that a delusion?

997
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:12,680
拉克哈先生自從來了以後 就一直搞破壞
Mr. Lockhart has been a disruptive element since he arrived.

998
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,860
他偷走不對外公開的病歷
He stole confidential medical files...

999
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:17,330
攻擊一名牙科人員
assaulted a member of our Dental staff...

1000
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,730
還威脅潘柏先生
and threatened Mr. Pembroke.

1001
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:21,340
我沒有威脅任何人
I didn't threaten anybody!

1002
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,670
我想你的確切字句是
I believe your exact words were...

1003
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,330
就算敲破他的頭
"If I have to, I'll hit him over the head

1004
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:30,180
揪著頭髮把他拖出去也在所不辭
"and drag him out by his hair."

1005
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:34,210
我被派來就是要帶潘柏回鈕約
I was sent here to bring Pembroke back to New York!

1006
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:37,780
根據你的雇主葛林先生的說詞
According to your employer, a Mr. Green...

1007
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:41,190
你遭到證交委員會調查
you're being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

1008
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:43,580
你是他們的人
You're one of them.

1009
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,520
拉克哈先生 聽聽你自己說的話
Listen to yourself, Mr. Lockhart.

1010
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,860
你生病了
You're not a well man.

1011
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,290
別再說我病了
Stop saying that!

1012
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,190
讓我們幫你吧 -別過來
- Let us help you. - Get back!

1013
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:54,470
我知道實驗的事
I know about the experiments.

1014
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,200
男爵跟他夫人的事
The baron and his wife.

1015
01:41:56,370 --> 01:42:00,370
他太常跟瓦金斯太太說話了
He has been spending time with Mrs. Watkins.

1016
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,480
瓦金斯是誰?
Who is Watkins?

1017
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,880
她在來我們這之前住過精神病院
She was institutionalized before she came to us.

1018
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:06,480
別人都會順著她
The others humor her...

1019
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:08,710
很顯然的 拉克哈因為生病
but clearly Mr. Lockhart's condition

1020
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:11,220
被她的除謀論影響了
has made him susceptible to her conspiracies.

1021
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:13,720
我知道你們在玩什麼把戲
I know what you're trying to do. All of you.

1022
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:16,220
想讓我以為我瘋了
You're trying to make me think I'm insane.

1023
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:18,290
我看過這種情況
I have seen this before.

1024
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,950
這很常見
It's not uncommon.

1025
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:23,660
深植內心的童年創傷浮出檯面
Some deep-seated childhood trauma rises to the surface...

1026
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:27,130
病患逃避一輩子就會這樣
something a patient has been running from their entire life.

1027
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,730
就你的情況來說
In your case...

1028
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:33,270
我認為你因為你父親的死
I would say misplaced guilt...

1029
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:36,310
而怪罪自已
over the death of your father.

1030
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:40,390
你怎麼會知道這件事? 我從來沒跟你說過
How do you know about that? I never told you that.

1031
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,180
你不用多說
You didn't have to.

1032
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,120
這是你來本院的原因吧?
That's why you came to us, isn't it?

1033
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:48,950
我看到他了
I saw him.

1034
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,150
潘柏死了
Pembroke is dead.

1035
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,990
鬧成這樣就是為了這件事?
That's what this is all about?

1036
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:57,690
邪惡的醫生殺死病人?
The evil doctor killing off his patients?

1037
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:58,960
沒錯
That's right.

1038
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:03,040
好 那我們就請教潘柏先生吧
All right. Perhaps we should consult Mr. Pembroke.

1039
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:08,970
你認識這個人嗎
Do you know this man?

1040
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,310
他想把我強押回去
He tried to take me back against my will.

1041
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,520
潘柏先生
Pembroke?

1042
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:16,850
拜託別讓他靠近我
Please keep him away from me.

1043
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,450
你死了
You were dead.

1044
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:20,950
你想提告嗎?
Do you wish press charges?

1045
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,220
沒有必要
That won't be necessary.

1046
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,620
拉克哈先生不是壞人
Mr. Lockhart is not a criminal.

1047
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,190
他只是病了
He is a patient.

1048
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,750
致董事會
To the members of the board...

1049
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:34,020
各位派我來此有所目的
You sent me here for a purpose.

1050
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,650
那就是強押一個人
To retrieve a man against his will...

1051
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:43,130
帶回你們的世界
and bring him back to your world.

1052
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,500
但我現在明白了
But I realize now...

1053
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:51,140
那不是我來的原因
that is not the reason I am here.

1054
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:56,440
每個人的內在都有某種病態
There is a sickness inside each of us.

1055
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:59,100
我們竭盡所能否認它的存在
We do our best to deny its existence...

1056
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,980
用逃避
dealing in lies...

1057
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,510
或是謊言來面對
and distraction.

1058
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,150
直到有一天
Until one day the body rebels against the mind

1059
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:09,210
身體對心理反抗吶喊
and screams out...

1060
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:14,630
我生病了
"I am not a well man."

1061
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:19,120
人無法忽視真相
A man cannot unsee the truth.

1062
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:29,700
人無法忽視真相
A man cannot unsee the truth.

1063
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,020
一旦看見光明
He cannot willingly return to darkness...

1064
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,700
就不可能自願回歸黑晴或選擇失明
or go blind once he has the gift of sight...

1065
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,560
就如同他無法回到未出生時
any more than he can be unborn.

1066
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:50,400
肏
Fuck.

1067
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:19,720
漢娜
Hannah!

1068
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:23,970
別過來
Stay away from me.

1069
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:25,770
漢娜 -別過來
- Hannah. - Stay away from me.

1070
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:27,570
我們得走了 -我叫你別過來
- We need to go. - I said stay away!

1071
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:35,320
好了 沒事了 請享用餐點吧
There. Everything is all right. Please enjoy your meal.

1072
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:38,680
漢娜
Hannah?

1073
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:41,250
你做了什麼事?
What have you done?

1074
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:47,790
我怎麼了?
What's happening to me?

1075
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,160
好了...
Here, here, here.

1076
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:53,030
沒事 你安全了
It's all right. You're safe now.

1077
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,170
別碰她
Leave her alone.

1078
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:56,200
拉克哈先生 她已經被你弄得夠煩了
Haven't you upset her enough, Mr. Lockhart?

1079
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:57,860
請送病人回房
Please, escort the patient back to his room.

1080
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:00,670
我不是他媽的病人
I am not a fucking patient!

1081
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:06,670
來啊
Come on!

1082
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,770
來啊
Come on!

1083
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:10,840
受夠這裡的跋腳跟老人了嗎?
Had enough of cripples and old people?

1084
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:12,110
來找我試試看啊
Try it with me!

1085
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:14,720
夠了 拉克哈先生
That's enough! Mr. Lockhart...

1086
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,450
我看得出你非常沮喪
I can see you're extremely upset.

1087
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:18,350
你來我的辦公室吧
Why don't you come with me to my office...

1088
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:20,460
我們可以討論你的疑惑
and we can discuss whatever's on your mind.

1089
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:21,950
不要
No.

1090
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:24,460
我們就在這裡談
We're gonna talk about it right here.

1091
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:29,330
在所有人面前談
In front of everybody.

1092
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,800
我認為這樣不太好
I don't think that's a good idea.

1093
01:57:30,970 --> 01:57:32,870
他在害大家生病
He's making you sick.

1094
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:37,570
這個地方會害你生病
This place is making you sick!

1095
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:44,980
病原在水裡
It's in the water.

1096
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:48,150
拉克哈先生
Mr. Lockhart.

1097
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,810
我看到跟木乃伊一樣的屍體
I saw the bodies dried up like mummies!

1098
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:53,820
看看你們
Look at you people!

1099
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,520
你們在掉牙齒
Your teeth are falling out!

1100
01:57:57,230 --> 01:57:59,170
你們快死了卻不自覺
You're dying, and you can't even see it.

1101
01:57:59,330 --> 01:58:00,730
可是我是來治療的
But I'm here for the cure.

1102
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:02,160
根本沒有療法
There is no cure!

1103
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:05,900
你們看不出來嗎?
Don't you see?

1104
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:09,400
就是他害大家生病的
He's the one that is making you sick!

1105
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:11,410
你們沒有問題
There's nothing wrong with you people!

1106
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:13,880
如果我是你 就不會這這麼做
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

1107
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:16,950
你們沒有問題
There's nothing wrong with you.

1108
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:24,510
對
Yes.

1109
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:26,780
對
Yes!

1110
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:30,860
就是這樣
That's it!

1111
01:58:31,030 --> 01:58:32,360
站起來吧
Stand up!

1112
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:37,800
快點
Come on!

1113
01:58:37,970 --> 01:58:38,960
對
Yes!

1114
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:40,700
站起來
Stand up!

1115
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,540
他在害你們生病
He is making you sick!

1116
01:58:45,110 --> 01:58:46,770
對 這樣就對了 來吧
Yes, that's it. Come on.

1117
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,540
這樣就對了
That's it!

1118
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:53,050
你們沒生病
There's nothing wrong with you!

1119
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,060
我生病了 -我生病了
I am not well.

1120
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:58,620
我生病了
I am not well.

1121
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:00,890
你們要幹嘛?
What are you doing?

1122
01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:03,450
你們要幹嘛?
What are you doing?

1123
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:09,390
他媽的放開我
Get the fuck off me!

1124
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:11,470
不...
No. No, no!

1125
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:13,100
放開我
Get off me.

1126
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,270
救救我 救我
Help me! Help!

1127
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,120
潘柏
Pembroke.

1128
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:57,150
潘柏先生
Pembroke.

1129
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:03,620
他們把你怎麼了?
What have they done to you?

1130
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:05,950
把我怎麼了?
Done to me?

1131
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:09,520
我從來沒感覺這麼好過
I've never felt better.

1132
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,630
拉克哈先生 放輕鬆
Relax, Mr. Lockhart.

1133
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:17,140
療程很快就結束了
It'll all be over soon.

1134
02:00:18,810 --> 02:00:21,800
沒錯 了不起的生物
Ah, yes. Remarkable creatures.

1135
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:29,850
在別的地方 這生物頂多才活十來年
Anywhere else on the planet, this species lives a dozen years, at most.

1136
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:32,150
但在我們的含水土層裡
Here, in our aquifer...

1137
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:34,180
它們能活三百年
they can live 300.

1138
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,150
就人類的生理而言
For the human physiology...

1139
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:42,590
水對人來說挺毒的 你也發現了
the effect of the water can be quite toxic as you have discovered.

1140
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:46,720
但經過適當的過濾就沒問題了
Unless, of course, it is properly filtered.

1141
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:52,070
這是男爵發明的療程
The baron devised the process.

1142
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:57,570
利用他土地所屬的人民實臉
Using the bodies of peasants that belonged to his land...

1143
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:01,000
他設法將水蒸餾至...
he managed to distill the water...

1144
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:03,770
活絡生命的精髓
to its life-giving essence.

1145
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:09,460
他當然為了他的聰明才智 付出慘痛代價
Of course, he paid a terrible price for his ingenuity.

1146
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:11,180
他唯一的錯...
His only mistake...

1147
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:14,590
就是利用了非自願的人當對象
was to use subjects who were unwilling.

1148
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:18,300
幸好 時代不一樣了
Luckily, times have changed.

1149
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:24,180
這兩百年是人類史上 生產力最旺盛的時期
The last 200 years have been the most productive in human history.

1150
02:01:24,470 --> 02:01:26,800
世人擺脫上帝
Man rid himself of God...

1151
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:30,070
擺脫階級以及賦予人類意義的一切
of hierarchy, of everything that gave him meaning...

1152
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:34,080
最後只剩下崇拜自我野心的空虛感
until he was left worshiping the empty altar of his own ambition.

1153
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:42,210
這是他們來此的原因
That is why they come.

1154
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:44,220
他們像你一樣
Men like you.

1155
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:49,390
拉克哈先生 你說得很對
You're quite right, Mr. Lockhart.

1156
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,960
沒有人離開過
No one ever leaves.

1157
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:54,990
但你搞錯了 是沒人想要離開
What you fail to understand is that no one wants to.

1158
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:17,250
知道人類困境的療法是什麼嗎?
Do you know what the cure for the human condition is?

1159
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:21,160
疾病
Disease.

1160
02:02:21,830 --> 02:02:25,430
因為唯有如此才有尋求療法的希望
Because only then is there hope for a cure.

1161
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:17,310
我不懂
I don't understand.

1162
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:20,650
多年來 我一在想保護你
For so many years, I've tried to protect you...

1163
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:23,810
遠離外界的污穢
from the impurities of the outside world.

1164
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:25,360
但諷刺的是
But ironically, it is your friend Mr. Lockhart

1165
02:03:25,490 --> 02:03:28,520
我們反倒得感謝你朋友拉克哈先生
who we have to thank.

1166
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,000
你現在是女人了
You're a woman now.

1167
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,500
可是我生病了
But I'm not well.

1168
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:45,070
我永遠都會在這裡照顧你
And I will always be here to take care of you.

1169
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,810
她醒了
She's awake now.

1170
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:30,420
你讓我以為我有一天會離開這裡
You made me believe I could leave here one day.

1171
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,290
怎麼會有人想要離開?
Why would anybody wanna leave?

1172
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,460
“范海克莫”

1173
02:07:24,430 --> 02:07:25,590
什麼事?
What is it?

1174
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,830
來
Come.

1175
02:07:39,450 --> 02:07:41,110
這是什麼地方?
What is this place?

1176
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,820
這裡就是你生命的起點
This is where you began.

1177
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:11,270
我不想要
I don't want to.

1178
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:18,940
你知道...
You know...

1179
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:22,490
你跟她在新婚之夜一模一樣
you look just like she did on her wedding night.

1180
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:24,120
“她不曉得”

1181
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:32,230
村民在那一晚把她從我身邊奪走
The night they took her from me.

1182
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:43,500
村民挖出胎兒並扔進含水土層
The villagers cut out the fetus and threw it in the aquifer.

1183
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:46,840
那孩子沒死
The child survived.

1184
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:20,610
拜託不要 -別怕
Please don't. Don't be frightened.

1185
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:22,840
我們很快又是一家人了
Soon we'll be a family again.

1186
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:25,580
這是我們永遠的宿命
The way we were always meant to be.

1187
02:09:41,870 --> 02:09:46,560
沒事 我妹一開始也抗拒過
It's all right. My sister was also somewhat resistant, at first.

1188
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,390
但不久之後 她就愛上了
But after a while, she grew to like it.

1189
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:57,980
我們不斷努力想製造純潔之物
We tried so many times to make something pure.

1190
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:06,150
那就是你 我的愛
That something was you, my love.

1191
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:11,560
現在...
And now...

1192
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:14,630
我們可以再度開始
we can begin again.

1193
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:48,100
我等好久了
I've waited so long.

1194
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:06,950
太久了
So long.

1195
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:22,730
他會占據你 好嗎?
He will have you. Yes?

1196
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:23,800
好
Yes.

1197
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:41,150
你不能永遠把她困在這裡
You can't keep her here forever.

1198
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:44,090
不能嗎?
No?

1199
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:51,000
你覺得她到外面會變成什麼樣?
And what do you think would become of her in your world?

1200
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:54,060
一大堆你們這種人
People like you come to me in droves

1201
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:56,160
帶著可有可無的生活來找我
with your disposable lives.

1202
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:58,400
她是你女兒
She's your daughter.

1203
02:12:03,610 --> 02:12:05,440
你又愛過什麼了?
And what have you ever loved, hmm?

1204
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:09,410
你做過什麼犧牲嗎?
What have you ever sacrificed?

1205
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:16,450
這就是外面世界的貢獻
This is what the outside world has to offer.

1206
02:12:33,870 --> 02:12:34,900
你說得對
You're right.

1207
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:39,210
不要
No.

1208
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:24,580
不要
No.

1209
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:08,530
失火了
Fire. Fire!

1210
02:15:11,930 --> 02:15:15,370
我經營的一切都是為了她
Everything I have built has been for her.

1211
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:23,810
你以為我會讓你這種人渣毀了嗎?
You think I would let someone like you destroy that?

1212
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:25,210
爸
Dad?

1213
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:35,410
漢娜
Hannah.

1214
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:59,130
“今日探訪時間已過”

1215
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:57,920
很壯觀吧?
Magnificent, isn't it?

1216
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:09,530
拉克哈
Lockhart!

1217
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:14,580
我們該走了
It's time to go.

1218
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:35,090
你沒事吧? -老天
- Are you okay? - Jesus Christ.

1219
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:39,140
別激動
Easy, easy.

1220
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:40,970
拉克哈?
Lockhart?

1221
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:42,570
不會吧
My God.

1222
02:18:42,980 --> 02:18:44,470
你做了什麼?
What have you done?

1223
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:48,440
潘柏呢?
Where's Pembroke?

1224
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:51,280
他走了
He's gone.

1225
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:53,010
他走了是什麼意思?
What do you mean "gone"?

1226
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:55,350
上車
Get in the car.

1227
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:03,490
你是來辦事的 記得嗎?
You came here to perform a task, remember?

1228
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:05,830
現在給我上車
Now get in the car.

1229
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,170
你聽到我說的話了嗎?
Did you hear what I said?

1230
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:24,450
你發瘋了嗎?
Have you lost your mind?

1231
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,350
其實...
Actually...

1232
02:19:31,630 --> 02:19:33,650
我感覺我好多了
I'm feeling much better.

1233
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:40,690
你搞什麼想去哪?
Where the hell are you going?

1234
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:44,300
拉克哈 拉克哈
Lockhart! Lockhart!

1235
02:26:21,870 --> 02:26:23,800
