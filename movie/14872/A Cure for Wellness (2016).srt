to the time of the barons.

For centuries, all this land

187
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,010
belonged to one family.

The Von Reichmerls.

Hmm. Interesting story.

191
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,840
Apparently, the last baron

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,764
was so obsessed with
the purity of his bloodline...

193
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
he decided only his sister

194
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,688
was clean enough to carry his child.

195
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,844
When the church forbade
the union, he renounced God.

196

That must have gone over well.

No shit.

198
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,244
So on his wedding night...

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,970
the villagers came up the hill...

200
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,122
chased the Baron and his bride
into the catacombs...

201
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,931
and made him watch
while they burned her alive.

202

Then they burned
the whole place to the ground.

I am the director of the sanitarium here.

316
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,850
How long have I been here?

317
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,047
Three days.

318
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,801
Oh, Jesus!

319
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,288
You can count yourself lucky.
It was a clean break.

320
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,841
Although I do feel partly responsible.

321
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,321
The locals tell me I should hunt
the deer on the property...

322
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
but I can't bring myself to harm
the innocent creatures.

323
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,891
After all, they were here long before us.

324
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,205
I need to call New York.

325
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,920
I took the liberty
of informing your office

326
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,082
of the accident, if that's your concern.

327
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,163
They agreed with me...

328
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,927
that business can wait
and your health cannot.

329
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,727
Hank Green said that?

330
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,280
Even the acting head

331
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,044
of a major Wall Street finance firm...

332
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,002
can't argue with the consequences
of a serious car accident.

333
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,685
We don't get many visitors here.

334
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,843
Most of my patients have done
extraordinary things.

335
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,163
Built vast fortunes...

336
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,243
commanded great empires...

337
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,889
but at a terrible cost.

338
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,522
They have no one who cares for them.

339
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,684
Mr. Pembroke is lucky.

340
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,126
He has you.

341
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,722
So, do your best to relax.

342
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,201
Enjoy yourself.

343
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,769
You are at the foot of the Swiss Alps...

344
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,281
one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

345
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,205
Think of it as an enforced vacation.

346
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,440
Although I know you Americans

347
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,727
are not so good at vacations, are you?

348
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,363
And remember, you're at altitude.

349
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,124
It can take a while to acclimatize...

350
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,250
so please make sure
you drink plenty of water.

351
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,885
Believe me, you're in good hands.

I guess so.

358
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,410
Where is it you're supposed to be?

Roland Pembroke.

the steam baths are in that direction.

372

It is Mr. Pembroke, isn't it?

373
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,525
Do I know you?

374
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,411
My name is Lockhart. Mr. Green sent me.

375
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,489
I thought they'd send Morris.

376
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,091
Morris is dead.

377
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,560
Heart attack.

378
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,766
Mr. Pembroke, I've come to
bring you back to New York.

379
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,680
You want me to leave here?

380
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,251
Just for a few days.

381
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm afraid I can't do that.

382
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,401
Why not?

383
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,361
I'm not well.

384
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,691
You look all right to me.

385
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,251
That's because you are blind.

386
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,611
As I was.

387
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,209
But soon you'll see.

388
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,204
Rest assured,
they'll take good care of you here.

389
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,243
I'm not a patient.

390
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,129
What happened to your leg?

391
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,490
Mr. Pembroke, the situation in New York

392
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,647
is really quite serious.

393
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,404
No longer my concern.

394
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,601
The director says
I must not involve myself

395
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,085
in business matters.

396
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,484
Have you met Director Volmer?

397
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,561
This morning.

398
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,643
He is a great man.

399
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,451
Kind man.

400
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,568
Not like other doctors.

401
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,721
Mr. Pembroke...

402
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,928
This obsession with blood.

403
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,890
You see, they have it all wrong.

404
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,082
Do you know the body is 65% water?

405
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,083
It's our fluids that must be purified.

406
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,402
Word that the merger
is in trouble has leaked.

407
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,721
The share price is in free fall.

408
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,966
Lockhart?

409
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,811
You're not any relation
to Henry Lockhart, are you?

410
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,081
My father.

411
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,090
You knew him?

412
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,249
We started out together.

413
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,442
Terrible, what happened to him.

414
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,605
They said there was a boy left in the car.

415
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,487
I don't remember much, to be honest.

416
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,002
He didn't deserve what we did to him.

417
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,451
What do you mean?

418
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,284
He was an honest man.

419
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,967
And we destroyed him for it.

420
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,124
Well, people get fucked over every day.

421
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,965
Either you have what it takes
to survive, or you don't.

422
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,811
And I suppose you do.

423
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,328
Is that why you came all this way?

424
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,851
Ambition?

425
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,526
Then you have it worse than any of us.

426
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,845
What's that?

427
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,121
The sickness.

428
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,841
Your father saw the truth
long before the rest of us.

429
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,970
The pointlessness of the entire endeavor.

430
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,481
We've all done terrible things.

431
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,808
So many terrible things.

432
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,446
What's it trading at?

433
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,006
What?

434
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,202
The stock! What's it trading at?

435
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,091
Eight and a half at close on Friday.

436
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,201
Parasites.

437
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,362
It'll be lower by now.

438

We're all concerned for your
well-being, Mr. Pembroke.

439
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,120
Mmm.

440
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,043
Just a few days.

441
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,000
There are certain irregularities
in some of the accounts...

442
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,525
that need to be clarified before

443
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,801
the merger can be completed.

444
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,929
And I suppose someone
has to take responsibility.

445
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,051
Something like that.

446
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,048
Then I better get my things.

447
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,041
I need a car to take me to the station.

448
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,404
Will you call one for me, please?

449
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,130
I'll see what I can do.

Life on this planet first came from water.

661
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,484
We spend the first nine months
of our existence submerged...

666
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,484
Think of it as a cleansing of the mind...

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,290
as much as the body.

670

it's just the toxins leaving the system.

Give yourself over completely

Using the bodies of peasants

a terrible price for his ingenuity.
