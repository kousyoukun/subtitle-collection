1
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:15,709
THE ODYSSEY

2
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:31,509
We must take her to the palace.

3
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,429
Hurry!

4
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,149
- Master, the baby is coming! 
- Take me home.

5
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:46,349
Tell them make ready.

6
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,709
Just think of us... just you and I...

7
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,909
Lying on the shore ...

8
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,669
Hold tight. Give me the pain.

9
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,949
Master!

10
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,309
Come this way!

11
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,709
The baby is coming!

12
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,509
The baby is coming!

13
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,869
Hold me. Hold me. Hold me in your eyes.

14
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:34,709
A boy!

15
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,589
I love you!

16
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,429
Show him his new home.

17
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,789
Look!

18
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,709
This day was the proudest day of my life.

19
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:47,509
My sweet Penelope and the gods had 
given me a son.

20
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,789
But at the same moment, the 
world we had built together

21
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:53,629
was changed forever.

22
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,829
Dark abord뛯ent my new shores:

23
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:04,749
My beloved Greece entered the war 
against Troy ...

24
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,429
The most powerful of kings,

25
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:17,869
Agamemnon and Menelaus himself, 
came for me.

26
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,749
Bound by my oath of allegiance

27
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,149
and honor me dictating to 
protect my country,

28
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,189
I was forced to leave my home,

29
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,549
not knowing if I would see 
my wife ever ...

30
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:34,229
and my child.

31
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,469
I am Odysseus, king of Ithica.

32
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,829
And this is my story.

33
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,229
No.

34
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,629
You must it leave here.

35
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:08,269
Mother ...

36
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,789
Eurybates!

37
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:30,389
Convene the Masters ... Gather the crew.

38
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,749
We leave for Troy.

39
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,469
The gods are with us!

40
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,349
Athena, my goddess, you 
have always protected me.

41
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:44,309
But today you remain silent.

42
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,309
Is there a way to avoid this war?

43
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,869
Talk to me.

44
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,829
No tears?

45
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:27,709
No tears.

46
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,669
Troy will not fall easily.

47
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,669
I love you!

48
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,949
- If ever I did not return ... 
- You will!

49
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,709
Do not even say the word!

50
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,189
You must allow me to die inside of your memory.

51
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,309
You'll always be my wife.

52
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:24,109
you choose another.

53
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,429
And you will marry.

54
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:31,269
Yes!

55
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,149
I love you!

56
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,389
I will return safe and sound ...

57
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,269
Living like this tree ...

58
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,829
around which we built our world.

59
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,429
I will wait.

60
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,709
Antiphus! Play a song of farewell!

61
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,589
Hoist the sail!

62
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,549
Return with the bodies of 
enemies you have killed!

63
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,549
And my CSUR rejoice.

64
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,589
Penelope gives R the same 
strength you gave me.

65
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:10,989
The gods of heaven and the 
sea we port훾rent jusqu'흻 Trojan

66
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,509
But I was alone.

67
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:22,269
You're sick, Eurylochus! He suffers from 
the disease of lies!

68
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,269
My word, yes!

69
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:27,549
The walls of Troy rise up to the clouds!

70
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:38,789
You are no longer with me, 
Athena. And rightly so ...

71
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,349
I can handle alone.

72
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,389
Is this a way of 
speaking your nearest protective?

73
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:54,629
- Athena! 
- Wine confuse you mind, Ulysses.

74
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,309
Me? I fear nothing!

75
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:05,349
I tease you. You are in anger after me.

76
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:10,269
You could convince Agamemnon, the day of 
the birth of my son!

77
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:14,549
I am a goddess! I have 
other things to nearest!

78
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,549
Remember: I can be seen by which I want.

79
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,149
I do not want you drop nearest the trip,

80
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,349
because I wanted you to leave.

81
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:43,349
I want to be you, brave 
Ulysses, who defeated the Trojans.

82
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,269
No, your destiny is to 
battle to become immortal!

83
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:53,909
Your name will be on the 
lips of all future generations!

84
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,669
Not require that future generations 
will remember my name!

85
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:02,709
You can not lie to me! 
I know your true character!

86
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:08,589
I know your pride ... Your vanity.

87
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,149
Look at them!

88
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:23,709
- Politis the Colossus, a real asshole. 
- What makes ruthless.

89
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,829
- Eurylochus, more lazy than you. 
- It's the best blacksmith in Greece.

90
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,669
Antiklos ... His curiosity always 
am훾nera him into trouble.

91
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,309
You'll have to do with to defeat the Trojans.

92
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:46,749
You should be brave Ulysses.

93
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,389
I will not fear ...

94
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,229
As you will be nearest me.

95
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,589
I stood alongside the mighty Achilles,

96
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,469
The most fierce Trojan warrior, 
and his troops.

97
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,629
Thousands of men died.

98
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:48,789
Mothers and wives pass훾rent hundreds 
of sleepless nights.

99
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,229
Play, play, play!

100
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:00,749
The fight!

101
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:20,909
Achilles! Hear me, Greek!

102
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:26,229
It's me, Hector, defender of Troy, which 
causes you to a duel!

103
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:32,269
Here, before the gods and your people, 
I will crack your chest ...

104
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:36,389
tear out your CSUR exciting ...

105
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,829
your blood and spit in the 
faces of your slaves!

106
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,189
Hector!

107
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,229
Hector is r me!

108
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,549
Headline me!

109
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,509
Headline me ...

110
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:21,989
It is r me!

111
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:25,949
Headline me!

112
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:51,509
I killed Hector! I will make Troy in ashes!

113
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:58,309
fell.

114
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,869
An irreparable loss.

115
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:04,669
Troy had just taken the best of us ...

116
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,469
and was still standing.

117
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,189
A common word on all lips 
Greek soldiers: give up.

118
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,869
But I refused nearest this sad end.

119
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,109
There was a way to get into Troy.

120
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,789
King Priam ...

121
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,189
Built with the wood of 
their ships abandoned ...

122
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:13,909
Let me go!

123
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,909
It was I who persuaded the Greeks to leave.

124
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:35,549
Nobody will ever the walls of Troy!

125
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,829
I convinced them to build the horse, and you 
offer it as a sign of defeat.

126
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,589
In gratitude, they called me a coward

127
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,309
and left me to beg you.

128
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:51,469
Powerful Priam, saving my life! And 
I'll be your slave!

129
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:54,829
Any idiot would understand that he is lying!

130
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,229
Laocoon, the soothsayer ...

131
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:01,949
He will lose!

132
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,309
This man lies as he breathes!

133
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:07,909
Good king, I swear!

134
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,749
Beware of Greeks and their gifts!

135
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:52,949
Warning!

136
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:09,549
It's a sign! Your prophet was 
punished for his lies!

137
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,109
You must accept this the Greeks!

138
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:20,429
Push it to the gates!

139
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:48,629
Place the rope.

140
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:27,269
The Greeks!

141
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:43,309
See, the gods of Heaven and 
the Sea! I conquered Troy!

142
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,949
Me, Odysseus!

143
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,469
I am irresistible!

144
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:04,749
Ulysses, why are you challenging me?

145
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:06,789
Who are you?

146
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:09,909
It's me, Poseidon,

147
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:23,749
For ten years, you played with 
us as with toys.

148
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:28,069
For ten years, you left your 
shores drink the blood!

149
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:32,549
But they are my servants who 
have reduced to silence Laocoon

150
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:35,469
when your horse was doomed.

151
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:39,109
Now you refuse to thank me.

152
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:43,589
You forget that men are 
nothing without the gods.

153
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,669
For this offense, you 
will know suffering.

154
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:54,229
Headline because of your arrogance, you will be 
tossed on the sea for eternity.

155
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:59,229
- You will never see again Ithaca. 
- You can not stop!

156
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,549
You will know pain.

157
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,869
Ulysses!

158
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,309
Look what we have!

159
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,589
Person ...

160
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:58,349
Victorious, confident, I left Troy.

161
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,829
My thoughts flew to my home

162
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,389
I had not seen for ten years.

163
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:14,469
You see, Telemachus is easy!

164
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:15,589
Telemachus?

165
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,869
- Telemachus, where are you? 
- You will not catch me!

166
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,149
You have not caught!

167
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:37,709
Mama, mama, save me!

168
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:38,949
Mother, mother!

169
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:40,669
Mother, mother!

170
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:41,789
Save me!

171
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,509
You, save me!

172
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,269
Telemachus ...

173
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,389
Fields, R tending sheep.

174
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,469
Eumaeus, Telemachus ram훾ne.

175
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,549
Come on boy, come on.

176
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,389
Get out!

177
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,829
It is too early to a man's job.

178
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,309
Because you do not let it grow.

179
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:32,589
- This is my son, not yours! 
- My son was ready nearest everything.

180
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:36,349
Yes, your son had his father.

181
00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:38,789
It's about time.

182
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:41,109
It will never be enough time.

183
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:44,749
Each day passed without Ulysses 
seems an eternity.

184
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:45,909
Yes ...

185
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:47,509
But ...

186
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,629
If Ulysses is dead ...

187
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:02,349
it will bear it and move forward.

188
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:11,389
You must raise a king!

189
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:15,309
You have a CSUR stone!

190
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:20,869
Yes!

191
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:57,149
Ulysses, Ulysses ...

192
00:28:57,189 --> 00:28:58,469
Atonement!

193
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,349
Poseidon did not wait for revenge.

194
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:31,429
For months, he plunged into the sea mist.

195
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,349
Separated from the rest of the fleet ...

196
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:37,149
I was lost.

197
00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:00,789
- Antiklos? 
- Nothing in sight, the fog!

198
00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:05,189
Antiphus!

199
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:09,829
Continue, and your flute and you'll 
end nearest the sea!

200
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:17,589
Earth is the earth!

201
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,589
Headline your benches!

202
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,589
- This is not Ithaca. 
- Ramez!

203
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:39,429
If men live here, they will 
tell us where we are.

204
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,709
Let others go, master, and join 
them if they cross someone.

205
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,789
Sheep or goats.

206
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:16,589
- And I'll be the first r found. 
- Elpenor ...

207
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:19,629
Am훾ne these for our guests.

208
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:23,829
- Stay close to the boat. 
- And let you go alone, master?

209
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:35,469
I won! An empty cave ... No 
wife, but ... lots of cheese!

210
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:41,829
It is good!

211
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,189
They keep the sheep in the cave with them.

212
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:06,709
No tools ...

213
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:09,669
No weapons.

214
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,789
There are a bunch!

215
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,469
No grain or oil ...

216
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,749
That cheese!

217
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,669
Wine!

218
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,429
We will exchange it against water.

219
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:04,509
Small nature!

220
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:09,629
Will you roll like a 
barrel when you're drunk!

221
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:13,789
Hey!

222
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,349
Let's see the shepherds.

223
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:55,629
We are only soldiers ...

224
00:33:58,109 --> 00:33:59,749
We got lost.

225
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,349
- And you used! 
- Why not?

226
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:05,189
Yes, we ...

227
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:07,509
We used ...

228
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,709
As your hosts, we ... We should have ...

229
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:15,229
According to the laws of hospitality.

230
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,469
Here, we have no laws! We do what we want!

231
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:25,629
You ...

232
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:27,749
Are you alone?

233
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:31,829
No, my brothers occupy the large caves.

234
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,149
Where are your parents?

235
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:37,829
Our mother is a nymph. Our 
father is the mighty Poseidon.

236
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:39,549
Poseidon ...

237
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,829
I am the youngest, Polyph훾me. 
What have you brought?

238
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,109
Brought?

239
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,469
We thought that ...

240
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:53,749
If you share a few sheep ... 
we could prepare you a feast.

241
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:55,589
A feast!

242
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,709
Cheese?

243
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,429
I love meat!

244
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:07,709
No!

245
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:09,349
Why not?

246
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:14,069
Because men do not eat them.

247
00:35:14,149 --> 00:35:16,309
The Cyclops, though!

248
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:47,309
Headline Who's next?

249
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,789
No, lower your arms ...

250
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,269
A My turn! Please.

251
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:01,789
Of course, in doing so, as you devour 
the magic contained in my skull.

252
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:09,429
Do you know what magic is lr
-in?

253
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,349
I spit out your head!

254
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:13,509
But you do not understand ...

255
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,189
The son of Poseidon, however, are not stupid!

256
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:17,269
You're not stupid!

257
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,709
If you kill me, you destroy all 
the secrets of the world!

258
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:21,949
What secrets?

259
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:24,189
What secrets?

260
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,149
Antiklos, wine!

261
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:38,629
- What is it? 
- Wine. This is the drink of the gods!

262
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:44,549
Taste!

263
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:12,429
I like that!

264
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:13,549
Another!

265
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:15,789
What is your name?

266
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:16,869
My name?

267
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:18,429
It is the king of ...

268
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:22,469
My name is Nobody.

269
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,669
Per 
- sound 
- no.

270
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:28,389
Well, one ...

271
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,229
Tomorrow morning you will 
trust other secrets,

272
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:35,389
for breakfast.

273
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,309
I'll kill him now!

274
00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:02,269
In silence, push!

275
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:06,669
Come on, push!

276
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,989
There must be another way.

277
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,709
Indeed.

278
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,189
My sil, my sil!

279
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:20,349
My Sil!

280
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:22,549
What have you done?

281
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:24,469
I see nothing!

282
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:27,469
Help! Help me, I can not see!

283
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:31,389
My brothers! He blinded me!

284
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,789
Nobody blinded me!

285
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,269
Wretches!

286
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,389
Where are you?

287
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:44,869
Where are you?

288
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,629
I'll kill you and eat you piece by piece!

289
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,669
Where are you?

290
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,149
Elpenor ...

291
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:07,549
Elpenor!

292
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:14,309
I'll get you! Where are you?

293
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,429
I catch you!

294
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:17,989
I hear you!

295
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:22,469
Where are you?

296
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:25,109
Where are you?

297
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:41,869
What happened?

298
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,549
- Man your oars! 
- What happened?

299
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:49,749
What happened?

300
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:54,109
A monster!

301
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:55,589
Polyphimus!

302
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:57,349
Polyphimus!

303
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,549
You hear me, Poseidon? I'm alive!

304
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:09,669
Odysseus is alive and you can stop it!

305
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:23,589
Father, avenge me!

306
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:34,749
Island of the Cyclops into the sunset.

307
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,749
Be quiet!

308
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:36,189
You're surprised? Admit it! I see 
that you are surprised!

309
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:38,229
Who are you?

310
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:41,269
I Aeolus, god of the winds.

311
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:46,749
This is my island, where gentle 
breezes and storms are rooted.

312
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:52,589
Well, since I am the nearest source ... Why 
do not you allow me to drink?

313
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,509
Advance!

314
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:11,469
Do not be afraid.

315
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:19,509
- Come here! 
- You know me?

316
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:21,869
Everyone knows Odysseus

317
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:25,109
the great hero who built the Trojan horse.

318
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:27,149
But ...

319
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,869
few Greeks know that you're the 
only who can not go home.

320
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:33,909
Poseidon still believes he can stop.

321
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:49,669
Guess who is the keeper of the winds?

322
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,229
It's me.

323
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:57,829
We'll show him! Give me that.

324
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:59,189
Give me that ...

325
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:00,309
Ulysses.

326
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:01,549
Thank you.

327
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:03,789
We'll show him.

328
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,469
I'm up!

329
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:52,469
These winds ...

330
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:57,189
Full of mischief! I left only 
the west wind free.

331
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:00,869
In nine days, he brought thee thy 
ship and you, r Ithaca.

332
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,189
And now ...

333
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,269
Catch!

334
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:11,229
Why do you help me?

335
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:15,669
Because you are the first mortal 
who uses his brain!

336
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:19,509
And who knew there was always 
something to learn nearest!

337
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:21,109
Now go!

338
00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:23,829
Above all, this also does not open!

339
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,549
Ulysses lucky ...

340
00:46:14,669 --> 00:46:18,589
We found water, and he ... he found gold.

341
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,509
Or better yet!

342
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:21,789
Not ...

343
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:41,229
I'll tell you what's inside Once 
we're in Ithaca, not before.

344
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:54,629
Soon, Aeolus had promised me ...

345
00:46:54,829 --> 00:47:00,669
Soon I will see my Penelope, 
my son, my homeland.

346
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:25,149
Tell nearest Penelope I will not sleep 
until you have found our bed.

347
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:30,229
Go!

348
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:57,269
Go get the wood!

349
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:07,749
My heart runaway like ...

350
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:12,589
I'm afraid to say it.

351
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:31,389
He finally fell asleep!

352
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:33,229
Then we must open the sack!

353
00:49:33,509 --> 00:49:35,749
It must be filled with riches!

354
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:37,309
We'll bet.

355
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:38,629
Politis!

356
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:42,869
But I want my share.

357
00:49:43,669 --> 00:49:45,549
- Perimedes? 
- You can open it,

358
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,149
it belongs to the master.

359
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:50,949
- What is the master is ours! 
- Ulysses can keep ...

360
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,549
- I just want to see it. 
- Me too.

361
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:08,669
Ithica!

362
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,309
Ithaca! Ithaca is!

363
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:12,869
Ithaca!

364
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,309
We're home!

365
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:16,949
- I must wake the master! 
- No.

366
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:21,949
Once we're there, we cannot anymore see what's
in the sack!

367
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:39,349
A strange feeling came over me.

368
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,469
Yes ...

369
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,189
It happens.

370
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:45,509
Master!

371
00:50:55,629 --> 00:50:56,749
Hurry!

372
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:01,109
Silence!

373
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,669
- Go! 
- Not easy to open.

374
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,109
What have you done?

375
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:22,189
What have you done?

376
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:23,909
Bring the seil!

377
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:25,869
Bring the seil!

378
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:29,829
I told you not to open prior to Ithaca!

379
00:51:30,229 --> 00:51:31,509
Not before Ithaca!

380
00:51:31,669 --> 00:51:33,109
What have you done?

381
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:50,229
Poor fools! You have betrayed me!

382
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:55,949
Poor fools!

383
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:08,909
You have betrayed me!

384
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,069
Or is it you were?

385
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:36,629
It is a boat?

386
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:52,469
But hope to hold in my 
arms at last Penelope ...

387
00:52:53,509 --> 00:52:56,549
was swept away by the fury 
of the raging winds.

388
00:52:57,629 --> 00:52:59,789
Carried away by the storm ...

389
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:02,589
all our food and our water lost ...

390
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:05,709
Now we were stranded ...

391
00:53:06,229 --> 00:53:08,309
on the far side of the world.

392
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,549
- Food! 
- Stay away!

393
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:49,589
Here, master, all I could find.

394
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:02,829
You will not have a grain of me.

395
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:09,069
You have acted alone, you must starve alone.

396
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:14,789
If there is game here ...

397
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:17,109
I will kill it! But I ...

398
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:20,949
I will share it! with my brothers!

399
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:28,749
Politis go with him.

400
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,469
Eyes open.

401
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:35,949
Perimedes!

402
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:51,749
Of gold and silver!

403
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:54,949
You have also opened and now we're starving!

404
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:04,389
Calm down!

405
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:29,509
Food!

406
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:47,669
Get him!

407
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:48,949
Get him!

408
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:51,549
A pig! Catch the pig!

409
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:52,629
Stop him!

410
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:17,189
No!

411
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:18,709
Stop grumbling!

412
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:21,509
I beg you, stop!

413
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:28,749
Where are the others?

414
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:30,829
- Captured! 
- By whom?

415
00:56:34,469 --> 00:56:39,229
It Politis! Our Politis turned into a pig!

416
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:46,709
- Eurylochus, don't let me kid. 
- It's true! I swear it!

417
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:49,429
This is the island of 
a witch, a sorceress!

418
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:51,389
It has transformed our animal companions,

419
00:56:51,469 --> 00:56:54,509
- I saw with my own eyes! 
- He's lying to protect themselves!

420
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:57,149
What did you, coward? You 
run from the fight?

421
00:56:57,229 --> 00:56:58,229
Master!

422
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:59,229
Let him speak!

423
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:02,229
We followed a trail to the 
summit of the mountain,

424
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:03,749
and suddenly came to the woods,

425
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:07,549
the sweet song of a woman 
invited us to join.

426
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:08,549
the witch.

427
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:12,469
We came nearest to his palace of stone, 
surrounded by animals: lions, wolves ...

428
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:15,349
We saw in the distance from 
a window nearest the other,

429
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:16,429
singing her song ...

430
00:57:16,509 --> 00:57:19,749
She invited us to come and eat and drink 
of his smooth voice, and all entr훾rent.

431
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:25,869
I stayed in the rear, yes! And 
I pretty well made me wary!

432
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:27,389
Continue.

433
00:57:27,469 --> 00:57:29,549
I approached ... And I saw ...

434
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:33,589
There was music. The witch 
has reached out ...

435
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:40,709
Impossible!

436
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:44,189
Only Politis뛱 a success of yourself away!

437
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,069
- Yes, it looks like nearest Politis. 
- Shut up!

438
00:57:49,389 --> 00:57:51,189
Master, you will not believe ...

439
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,749
Are we going to starve because 
of his lies nearest?

440
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:58,229
If you touch the nearest pig, 
I'll strangle nearest bare hands!

441
00:58:00,749 --> 00:58:01,749
Enough!

442
00:58:02,669 --> 00:58:05,829
- You swear it's true? 
- On my life!

443
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:15,829
Master!

444
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:20,349
Master, do not go! It will throw you a lot!

445
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:22,189
I sent them over there.

446
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:23,629
I bring them back.

447
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,149
Stay away!

448
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:37,469
Don't try to get closer!

449
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:44,629
Antiklos?

450
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:49,149
Where are the others?

451
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:42,589
Warning ...

452
01:00:47,709 --> 01:00:50,629
Hermes, the messenger of the gods.

453
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,709
- In person. 
- Finally!

454
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:54,389
Athena sent you.

455
01:00:54,949 --> 01:00:56,229
I beg you ...

456
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:01,189
Catches up with my sword.

457
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:02,269
Sorry.

458
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:04,069
Not allowed to touch.

459
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,669
Only he talk to you. Take my advice:

460
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:11,669
Reach the rock.

461
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:13,149
Which?

462
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:14,669
One!

463
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:29,789
Hey!

464
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:31,429
Swallow this.

465
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:35,589
Not ... It's moly ...

466
01:01:35,669 --> 01:01:36,909
It has poison.

467
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:40,509
It is I who give it to you 
... A god to a mortal.

468
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:42,429
No, I refuse.

469
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:44,909
Good!

470
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:49,309
But it is the only way to 
counter the fate of the witch.

471
01:01:51,429 --> 01:01:53,189
You do not trust me?

472
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:03,389
She knows that you get.

473
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,469
But now

474
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:07,629
when you drink the potion with honey, 
you shall preserve human form.

475
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:10,949
This will disconcert the witch.

476
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:18,389
Frightens her a little! It will make 
you an offer then ...

477
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:20,749
Take her to bed.

478
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:24,589
It does not say she is a goddess!

479
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,909
Only after that it will make you your men.

480
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:38,509
Come on! You're almost there.

481
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:49,869
You must be hungry and thirsty.

482
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:12,109
Again.

483
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:40,189
Very sweet.

484
01:04:59,349 --> 01:05:01,269
You do not change me.

485
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:03,949
No?

486
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:06,829
No.

487
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:12,109
What will you do with that knife?

488
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:13,509
Remove yourself life.

489
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:14,589
Do it.

490
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:18,669
And the more you will never 
again see your men.

491
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:23,269
Ulysses!

492
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:27,549
If you want your soldiers regain 
their human form ...

493
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:44,189
Are you still a man?

494
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,869
Band of assassins without faith! Murderers, 
here what you are!

495
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:11,949
Belly full of assassins!

496
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:16,309
I believe you, Eurylochus, but I 
can not stop them alone!

497
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,829
I'll take your part!

498
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:20,149
Do not cut me, species of idiot!

499
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:32,309
Politis! I told you it was him!

500
01:06:37,149 --> 01:06:40,629
- Politis! 
- You remember Politis!

501
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:47,349
They will remember you!

502
01:07:13,749 --> 01:07:16,349
Bring your men here ...

503
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,709
To eat and rest.

504
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:35,229
Circe ...

505
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:37,429
Music fills our senses ...

506
01:07:37,869 --> 01:07:40,429
and minds with the magic of the lotus petals.

507
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:44,109
His potions weakened our bodies ...

508
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,349
- I'm going hunting. 
- Not with that!

509
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:06,869
Not yet!

510
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,629
But it is mine!

511
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:14,429
If I am old enough to keep cattle 
from my father and hunt his game,

512
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:17,509
- I am old enough to use his bow! 
- If you can string it...

513
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:19,349
then you can hunt with.

514
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:22,389
If you can not,

515
01:08:22,469 --> 01:08:28,269
you will place it to your father's treasury
til I give it to you.

516
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:40,309
It Anticleia mistress! She goes to 
the shore! Come quickly!

517
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:43,149
Anticleia!

518
01:08:45,309 --> 01:08:46,309
Anticleia!

519
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:50,149
I can not wait!

520
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:51,629
If Ulysses is dead ...

521
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:53,829
- I will find in the sea 
- it is alive!

522
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:55,469
We will wait together.

523
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:57,789
- Together! 
- Nooo!

524
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:03,349
Leave me!

525
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:09,349
Anticleia!

526
01:09:20,429 --> 01:09:21,749
I am ashamed ...

527
01:09:21,869 --> 01:09:24,669
But my stone heart have broken.

528
01:09:24,749 --> 01:09:27,229
It only remains for me nothing to be crying!

529
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:34,349
You're not the mother of my 
husband, you're my mother!

530
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,509
You're my father ...

531
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:49,629
You're strong enough!

532
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:54,829
You make me feel ...

533
01:09:55,269 --> 01:09:56,789
nearest your side.

534
01:10:00,389 --> 01:10:01,389
Even ...

535
01:10:01,469 --> 01:10:03,349
since Hades.

536
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:09,229
No!

537
01:10:11,309 --> 01:10:12,509
Please ...

538
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:15,869
You will not stop.

539
01:10:25,629 --> 01:10:27,109
No tears.

540
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:19,509
Yes.

541
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:21,789
Why?

542
01:12:23,429 --> 01:12:26,549
When we shared this bed, you've forgotten.

543
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,709
No.

544
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:32,189
You have given so much, Circe ...

545
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:37,629
but no bed in the world 
will make me forget Penelope.

546
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:40,629
Not in my lifetime ...

547
01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:44,669
let alone in five days.

548
01:12:52,749 --> 01:12:54,749
Poor Ulysses ...

549
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:59,349
who believe they have been here for five 
days, while it has been five years.

550
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:03,349
How do you play?

551
01:13:17,589 --> 01:13:20,629
What you think one day or one hour ...

552
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:23,749
is a year out of these walls.

553
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:27,149
I saw the sun rise and set, it is impossible.

554
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:29,309
If you need proof,

555
01:13:29,389 --> 01:13:33,509
will see your boat, five years 
covered by the tide.

556
01:13:38,429 --> 01:13:43,309
And ask yourself if the memory of your 
wife is as good as yours!

557
01:13:43,429 --> 01:13:47,109
Or has found a new companion!

558
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:39,349
Awake!

559
01:14:40,469 --> 01:14:41,749
Awake!

560
01:14:42,389 --> 01:14:43,389
Up!

561
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:47,829
Awake!

562
01:14:48,589 --> 01:14:50,709
I see that now you believe me.

563
01:14:52,549 --> 01:14:55,109
You have conspired against me with Poseidon!

564
01:14:55,269 --> 01:14:57,229
Do not blame the gods for your actions,

565
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:05,469
Fifteen years ... I have not seen my son ...

566
01:15:06,389 --> 01:15:07,869
and my country.

567
01:15:09,389 --> 01:15:10,389
And my mother ...

568
01:15:10,469 --> 01:15:13,149
Or hit your wife lonely.

569
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:20,589
You will lose more than five years, if 
you do not realize what you are.

570
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:24,789
You, open your eyes and see who I am!

571
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:29,629
Or nearest you to help me go home ...

572
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:40,829
I know a man who knows how to nearest Ithaca.

573
01:15:46,829 --> 01:15:47,829
Speak!

574
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:54,589
- Tiresias, the seer. 
- Tiresias is dead!

575
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:58,909
If you still want to go home,

576
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:07,789
Only LR or you will find 
answers nearest your questions.

577
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:10,389
The Had훾s ...

578
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:13,309
The kingdom of the dead.

579
01:16:15,389 --> 01:16:17,389
You are right to be scared.

580
01:16:22,069 --> 01:16:23,749
How do I find Tiresias?

581
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:27,429
You'll have to cross a river of 
fire and sacrifice a ram.

582
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:32,469
Then you must enter the fire ...

583
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:40,909
Go!

584
01:17:04,789 --> 01:17:08,109
Five years ran away with the tide!

585
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:11,909
Five years of suffering for Penelope!

586
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:14,509
And my son?

587
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:16,589
He has fifteen years!

588
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:18,829
And still ...

589
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:21,189
without his father.

590
01:18:05,949 --> 01:18:07,109
The boy ...

591
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:16,349
Lord Antinous ...

592
01:18:16,429 --> 01:18:18,829
Lord Eurymachus, nobles of Ithaca ...

593
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,509
New?

594
01:18:23,109 --> 01:18:24,109
No.

595
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:26,709
Your father died a long time!

596
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:29,949
You can not say that there is no evidence!

597
01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:34,149
All those who fought nearest Troy 
went home long ago.

598
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:39,109
Or the lord Odysseus is dead, and 
the sea is his tomb,

599
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:40,509
or ...

600
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:42,909
he chose not to return ...

601
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:45,229
and abandon your mother ...

602
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:49,829
and you.

603
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:54,509
and remarry.

604
01:19:08,269 --> 01:19:10,189
Men are in the lobby ...

605
01:19:10,749 --> 01:19:12,229
They say they come for you.

606
01:19:12,309 --> 01:19:15,109
Men ... who say that my father is dead!

607
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:18,589
They brought presents, I receive 
them. And you too!

608
01:19:19,749 --> 01:19:21,509
So is the custom:

609
01:19:21,589 --> 01:19:23,429
welcome our guests, feed them ...

610
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,789
Your father respected these uses, too, 
you will do the same!

611
01:19:26,869 --> 01:19:28,149
No way!

612
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:34,189
Termine, M챕lanth챕e.

613
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,229
Mistress ...

614
01:19:44,589 --> 01:19:46,429
You're still beautiful!

615
01:19:48,669 --> 01:19:51,349
The nobles of Ithaca nearest 
knees begging you!

616
01:19:55,989 --> 01:19:59,749
I receive these men and that's it.

617
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:04,869
They have nothing that 
belongs nearest Ulysses.

618
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:08,869
Neither his wealth ...

619
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:07,749
The river of fire ...

620
01:22:12,269 --> 01:22:13,269
Not ...

621
01:22:14,749 --> 01:22:16,509
I must cross it alone.

622
01:22:25,269 --> 01:22:27,309
Your soul will be washed away by the flames.

623
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:46,589
You have always followed.

624
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,309
You are my warriors.

625
01:22:55,109 --> 01:22:58,669
Your time has not rung in 
arriving at this house ...

626
01:22:58,829 --> 01:23:00,189
The remains of Had훾s.

627
01:23:03,829 --> 01:23:06,629
We have suffered the loss 
of many comrades ...

628
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:07,789
together.

629
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:14,149
together.

630
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,069
And now ...

631
01:23:17,349 --> 01:23:19,829
it may well be that we are together ...

632
01:23:25,109 --> 01:23:26,269
If you get there!

633
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:27,709
You'll get there.

634
01:23:28,469 --> 01:23:30,789
It is I who would be lost without you.

635
01:23:54,269 --> 01:23:56,509
Eventually you will reach Ithaca.

636
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:33,789
Rear!

637
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:35,909
Rear!

638
01:24:41,829 --> 01:24:43,869
This ram is not for you!

639
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:45,629
Rear!

640
01:24:46,309 --> 01:24:47,309
Rear!

641
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:53,789
- Come on! 
- Rear!

642
01:25:02,189 --> 01:25:03,189
Antiphus!

643
01:25:03,909 --> 01:25:05,789
McNee Tiresias nearest me.

644
01:25:08,669 --> 01:25:09,789
Please!

645
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:49,989
to find a blind seer.

646
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:57,789
Am훾ne the ram and sacrificed it.

647
01:26:58,749 --> 01:27:00,589
First, show me the road.

648
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:04,469
You're a cunning man, Odysseus of Ithaca ...

649
01:27:04,549 --> 01:27:06,549
but not very wise.

650
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:10,389
Your eyes are blinded by your own country ...

651
01:27:10,669 --> 01:27:15,349
Can not you see that your journey 
that gives meaning nearest your life.

652
01:27:15,909 --> 01:27:20,709
When you have understood this, you will 
understand the meaning of "wisdom".

653
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:22,229
Not ...

654
01:27:22,789 --> 01:27:24,229
Wisdom ...

655
01:27:24,589 --> 01:27:26,189
I'll find one.

656
01:27:27,629 --> 01:27:29,429
Help me find my nearest way!

657
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:36,789
The answer was in your eyes 
all the nights at sea

658
01:27:37,109 --> 01:27:39,829
From this side of the kingdom of Poseidon ...

659
01:27:39,909 --> 01:27:43,389
is a constellation which is never 
below the horizon ...

660
01:27:43,469 --> 01:27:44,989
crouched like a hunter.

661
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:49,629
Put the cap on its brightest star ...

662
01:27:51,549 --> 01:27:54,309
you will reach the Straits of Scylla ...

663
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:56,189
and Charybdis.

664
01:27:56,749 --> 01:27:58,549
On the one hand ...

665
01:28:04,389 --> 01:28:05,869
Scylla is.

666
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:09,669
Always thirsty for blood, she hides 
in the shadows ...

667
01:28:12,309 --> 01:28:13,549
And the other?

668
01:28:14,109 --> 01:28:16,509
The gulf marine Charybdis?

669
01:28:16,589 --> 01:28:18,509
Its waters seem calm ...

670
01:28:18,589 --> 01:28:20,629
She invites R goes ...

671
01:28:20,749 --> 01:28:25,429
but it is a terrifying creature! When 
she opens her mouth wide open,

672
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:27,789
you and all those who accompany you ...

673
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,229
will be swallowed by his power!

674
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:07,109
This way, my son.

675
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:17,749
- M챔re ... 
- Yes ... I'm here.

676
01:29:20,309 --> 01:29:21,309
Mother ...

677
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:25,269
I ended my day by nearest pain.

678
01:29:25,469 --> 01:29:27,709
I just could not wait for you.

679
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:36,789
- M챔re ... 
- Forgive me.

680
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:43,269
- She's waiting for you. 
- Where?

681
01:29:43,509 --> 01:29:47,549
You must be quick ... Men 
trying to steal your wife.

682
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:32,549
Penelope was alive and waiting for me.

683
01:30:50,429 --> 01:30:53,389
- Who voil흻! 
- Look at that idiot!

684
01:30:53,589 --> 01:30:57,949
- Are you the queen Penelope? 
- I am the wife of King Odysseus.

685
01:30:58,149 --> 01:31:00,149
Humbly, I ...

686
01:31:00,669 --> 01:31:02,269
Humbly ...

687
01:31:02,349 --> 01:31:04,109
- Listen to me ...

688
01:31:05,389 --> 01:31:08,949
I Elatos of Dulikhion.

01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:11,389
I poss훾de sheep ...

690
01:31:11,469 --> 01:31:12,709
and pigs.

691
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:14,709
I came ...

692
01:31:15,349 --> 01:31:16,509
I lr ...

693
01:31:19,789 --> 01:31:22,509
nearest to join the men of noble birth.

694
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:30,149
Play!

695
01:31:55,789 --> 01:31:56,789
Woman!

696
01:31:56,869 --> 01:31:58,549
Bring us the wine!

697
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:08,789
J'esp훾re my father died a hero.

698
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:13,589
If still alive, he has forgotten me.

699
01:32:15,509 --> 01:32:16,509
Come!

700
01:32:16,749 --> 01:32:17,749
Follow me.

701
01:32:48,109 --> 01:32:50,429
he would return safe and sound ...

702
01:32:50,509 --> 01:32:54,829
also what the living tree, around 
which we built our world.

703
01:32:56,189 --> 01:32:58,949
If he is alive ... why did not he return?

704
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:03,949
I know your father. He is alive.

705
01:33:11,829 --> 01:33:13,429
The day your father is gone,

706
01:33:13,509 --> 01:33:18,429
I promised him that if he had not come 
back when you were a man ...

707
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,429
with the beard ...

708
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:23,109
I remarry.

709
01:33:28,589 --> 01:33:30,429
I will keep my promise.

710
01:33:35,389 --> 01:33:37,389
You do not have a beard.

711
01:33:37,469 --> 01:33:38,629
And these men?

712
01:33:39,549 --> 01:33:41,709
I'll wait.

713
01:33:43,509 --> 01:33:46,189
McNee nearest me your mistress, I 
must talk to him.

714
01:33:57,509 --> 01:33:58,509
All of you ...

715
01:33:58,589 --> 01:34:02,109
believe that Odysseus, king of Ithaca, died.

716
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:03,229
Yes.

717
01:34:03,309 --> 01:34:04,309
Not me.

718
01:34:07,269 --> 01:34:10,949
I will start nearest weave a 
shroud for my husband disappeared.

719
01:34:11,269 --> 01:34:14,149
If it does not reappear nearest 
Ithaca before I finished

720
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:17,829
I will choose one of you to 
take his place nearest me.

721
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:20,269
I will send for my servant to help you!

722
01:34:20,829 --> 01:34:23,149
I have to perform this task alone.

723
01:34:23,269 --> 01:34:24,549
Build one!

724
01:34:24,629 --> 01:34:27,269
We will be old when you're done!

725
01:34:33,829 --> 01:34:36,509
You filed this R my door ...

726
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:39,949
I offered you a feast in return.

727
01:34:40,469 --> 01:34:43,789
Now I rely A Your Honor. Go home.

728
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:47,549
- You will know my decision. 
- We ...

729
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:51,149
stay where we are!

730
01:34:51,229 --> 01:34:53,669
We will not leave until you 
have made your choice!

731
01:34:55,509 --> 01:34:58,469
The wine is excellent for your husband ...

732
01:35:27,469 --> 01:35:29,669
Winter gave way to spring

733
01:35:29,749 --> 01:35:33,309
when we reached the Straits 
of Scylla and Charybdis.

734
01:35:34,509 --> 01:35:36,789
After sixteen years of tests,

735
01:35:36,869 --> 01:35:40,469
nothing frightens us, my 
warriors and me.

736
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:48,829
But we had never seen what 
we saw between the rocks.

737
01:36:15,189 --> 01:36:16,229
Antiklos ...

738
01:36:17,549 --> 01:36:18,869
Lights a torch.

739
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:51,509
There is nothing here!

740
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:04,069
A torch! Give me a torch!

741
01:37:05,949 --> 01:37:07,469
Elpenor!

742
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:10,429
Push! Push!

743
01:37:32,309 --> 01:37:34,069

Give the goats.

747
01:38:17,829 --> 01:38:19,429

748
01:38:47,909 --> 01:38:48,949
Come!

749
01:38:53,709 --> 01:38:54,789
Go!

750
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:58,389
Go!

751
01:38:58,669 --> 01:38:59,749
Am훾ne up!

752
01:39:17,829 --> 01:39:18,829
The oars!

753
01:39:18,909 --> 01:39:20,349
Stay on this side!

754
01:39:26,829 --> 01:39:28,749
Ramez if you want to live!

755
01:40:06,909 --> 01:40:08,469
Politis, growing!

756
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:09,949
Climb!

757
01:40:14,589 --> 01:40:16,509
Politis, hold on!

758
01:40:24,629 --> 01:40:25,629
Politis!

759
01:40:27,869 --> 01:40:28,869
Master!

760
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:45,269
Antiklos?

761
01:40:51,229 --> 01:40:52,429
Grab now!

762
01:41:36,269 --> 01:41:37,389
Eurycleia!

763
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:39,429
Can not you see?

764
01:41:40,109 --> 01:41:41,469
The men are thirsty!

765
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:57,469
- The tapestry is never finished. 
- I can continue it if you want.

766
01:41:57,509 --> 01:41:58,509
No!

767
01:42:00,909 --> 01:42:02,189
Close the door.

768
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:04,189
Mistress?

769
01:42:04,709 --> 01:42:05,709
The door!

770
01:42:11,389 --> 01:42:14,269
I will not serve another moment 
the dogs of strangers!

771
01:42:14,349 --> 01:42:16,549
They get drunk, sleep LR or they s'affalent!

772
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:21,309
I have to step over that pig as 
soon as I enter Elatos the cellar!

773
01:42:21,749 --> 01:42:23,869
See men of our own island,

774
01:42:23,949 --> 01:42:26,149
binge on your back and that of Telemachus

775
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:27,309
is too much for me!

776
01:42:27,389 --> 01:42:30,949
- At least, it has become living here. 
- M챕lanth챕e, silence!

777
01:42:32,749 --> 01:42:35,469
I saw how you t'affairais 
around this snake Eurymachus.

778
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:46,229
The guests leave when they are told.

779
01:42:46,309 --> 01:42:48,509
How long will we stand it?

780
01:42:48,589 --> 01:42:50,909
- How long ... 
- Calm down, stop!

781
01:42:51,389 --> 01:42:52,389
Listen to me!

782
01:42:52,469 --> 01:42:53,829
I have given order r Eumaeus!

783
01:42:54,429 --> 01:42:56,269
They will soon have meat!

784
01:42:57,069 --> 01:42:58,469
They will leave ...

785
01:42:58,549 --> 01:43:01,269
We can not chase them, but ... they are men:

786
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:03,949
they listen to their empty stomachs.

787
01:43:04,189 --> 01:43:06,949
Penelope, I won! Me, I won!

788
01:43:15,229 --> 01:43:16,509
Only ...

789
01:43:17,509 --> 01:43:20,469
My men died before my eyes ...

790
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:23,869
I drifted for days on the 
sea of Poseidon ...

791
01:43:25,589 --> 01:43:28,189
wondering when he would take my life.

792
01:44:15,149 --> 01:44:16,149
People ...

793
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:33,189
Where am I?

794
01:44:33,949 --> 01:44:34,949
You're safe.

795
01:44:38,429 --> 01:44:41,589
- I need water. 
- Bring him water!

796
01:44:46,789 --> 01:44:48,269
I need a ship.

797
01:44:54,309 --> 01:44:57,069
No one comes or not proceed from my island.

798
01:45:00,429 --> 01:45:03,149
I have ... I must find the way to go home.

799
01:45:23,309 --> 01:45:26,269
you're the first man they see in their lives.

800
01:45:30,189 --> 01:45:34,749
Myself, I have not seen for 
over a hundred years!

801
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:43,469
You are a goddess ...

802
01:45:45,989 --> 01:45:47,109
I am Calypso.

803
01:45:50,109 --> 01:45:51,109
Come!

804
01:45:51,629 --> 01:45:52,629
Rest.

805
01:46:44,869 --> 01:46:46,909
This is only a dream.

806
01:46:50,829 --> 01:46:51,949
That's true.

807
01:46:54,349 --> 01:46:55,949
My men ...

808
01:47:03,429 --> 01:47:04,949
All dead.

809
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:22,749
- You have to forget. 
- No.

810
01:47:24,589 --> 01:47:25,589
Forget!

811
01:48:14,669 --> 01:48:15,669
Telemachus!

812
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:21,469
I'll kill Antinous ... Others 
too, if need be!

813
01:48:26,109 --> 01:48:29,309
d챕j흻 he fought and killed 
men with his sword!

814
01:48:29,389 --> 01:48:31,629
- The time has come! 
- No!

815
01:48:34,269 --> 01:48:37,469
If you kill him, others will not leave.

816
01:48:37,629 --> 01:48:40,309
You will give them an excuse 
to turn against you.

817
01:48:54,509 --> 01:48:56,229
So tell me ...

818
01:48:56,309 --> 01:48:57,829
what can I do?

819
01:48:57,909 --> 01:48:59,789
Do what your father would have done ...

820
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:04,429
Ask for help those nearest to him loyal.

821
01:49:07,309 --> 01:49:10,429
Call the meeting! Who am I?

822
01:49:12,149 --> 01:49:14,149
You know who you are!

823
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,789
You are the son of Odysseus!

824
01:49:19,629 --> 01:49:21,149
Convene them ...

825
01:49:26,389 --> 01:49:29,669
Ithaca is called!

826
01:49:30,949 --> 01:49:34,629
Meeting called R!

827
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:39,269
Ithaca is called!

828
01:49:41,309 --> 01:49:43,749
Meeting called R!

829
01:49:53,829 --> 01:49:56,549
Hear me, good people!

830
01:49:56,949 --> 01:49:58,549
Hear me!

831
01:50:02,669 --> 01:50:06,709
I waited a long, long time now.

832
01:50:06,789 --> 01:50:08,829
Mentor, let him speak!

833
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:17,349
Good people ...

834
01:50:22,109 --> 01:50:24,549
who have called you in here.

835
01:50:24,789 --> 01:50:27,349
An army of suitors invaded my mouth!

836
01:50:27,589 --> 01:50:31,189
They massacred my ox, my pig, 
my sheep to feast!

837
01:50:31,269 --> 01:50:33,469
Soon I will have nothing to be eating!

838
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:39,869
In front of my mother,

839
01:50:39,949 --> 01:50:43,309
they hit my servants and my handmaidens whip!

840
01:50:45,549 --> 01:50:46,949
I ask you ...

841
01:50:49,629 --> 01:50:51,189
on behalf of my father ...

842
01:50:56,669 --> 01:50:57,829
Good people!

843
01:51:03,149 --> 01:51:05,749
We contenders, have violated any law,

844
01:51:05,829 --> 01:51:09,149
have not taken anything that 
was ours by right!

845
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:12,349
The shame lies in its mother!

846
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:17,229
We offered gifts, she has 
accepted them without question!

847
01:51:17,429 --> 01:51:19,909
Now she must choose between us ...

848
01:51:22,389 --> 01:51:24,829
It's your right.

849
01:51:28,509 --> 01:51:30,389
She must choose.

850
01:51:32,469 --> 01:51:33,589
Good people!

851
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:35,709
Not one of us ...

852
01:51:35,789 --> 01:51:39,069
would think of bloodshed nearest cause 
of sheep or pigs!

853
01:51:44,789 --> 01:51:47,309
We can not do anything more ... Let's go.

854
01:51:49,149 --> 01:51:51,149
- But my father ... 
- He's dead!

855
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:04,429
You would kill me ...

856
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:06,949
Tell me! I see ...

857
01:52:10,069 --> 01:52:13,629
If you do not want me ... so give me a ship!

858
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:20,109
It's not worth it, Telemachus.

859
01:52:21,349 --> 01:52:22,349
Wait!

860
01:52:23,509 --> 01:52:24,509
Wait.

861
01:52:26,749 --> 01:52:28,909
The boy should not be punished ...

862
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:32,549
If he wants a ship ... we 
will give him a ship.

863
01:52:32,669 --> 01:52:33,669
The old?

864
01:52:35,629 --> 01:52:40,069
- You'll have your ship, Telemachus. 
- You'll have your ship, Telemachus!

865
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:42,189
Go and find your father!

866
01:52:44,469 --> 01:52:47,629
- You have a reason to do that? 
- It will end like his father ...

867
01:52:49,349 --> 01:52:52,269
- And if he comes back? 
- We welcome the ...

868
01:52:52,789 --> 01:52:54,589
a spear in the back.

869
01:53:16,909 --> 01:53:20,869
When I touch your skin, I wonder 
Where did you get that scar.

870
01:53:22,469 --> 01:53:24,189
Trojan ...

871
01:53:26,869 --> 01:53:29,269
The day we Achilles was delighted.

872
01:53:32,349 --> 01:53:35,869
- And this lr, during a battle? 
- A wild boar.

873
01:53:38,869 --> 01:53:40,909
and my mother cried ...

874
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:43,429
tears of joy.

875
01:54:02,829 --> 01:54:03,949
This way!

876
01:54:04,309 --> 01:54:05,309
Here!

877
01:54:06,109 --> 01:54:08,549
Hey! Here!

878
01:54:19,829 --> 01:54:21,509
Bring it!

879
01:54:53,909 --> 01:54:57,509
You were going to leave without even 
thank me for my kindness.

880
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:04,589
And everything that lives here are 
only to serve me!

881
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:10,749
In ten years or maybe ever.

882
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:18,269
Ithaca forget!

883
01:55:20,349 --> 01:55:21,909
Your home is here.

884
01:55:31,589 --> 01:55:34,109
You did not say goodbye nearest your mother.

885
01:55:34,429 --> 01:55:37,789
Grief can be read on your face.

886
01:55:38,149 --> 01:55:39,909
She would have tried to stop me.

887
01:55:40,589 --> 01:55:43,909
- You are right to fear the sea 
- I'm not afraid!

888
01:55:48,109 --> 01:55:50,389
I never left Ithaca!

889
01:55:51,349 --> 01:55:56,789
Do not t'inqui훾te: the gods favor you.

890
01:55:56,869 --> 01:55:57,909
Favorable?

891
01:55:59,949 --> 01:56:01,429
The gods cursed me ...

892
01:56:01,909 --> 01:56:03,389
the day I was born.

893
01:56:04,949 --> 01:56:06,189
Leave me alone!

894
01:56:18,829 --> 01:56:21,109
You have the head as hard as your father!

895
01:56:21,589 --> 01:56:22,589
Athena?

896
01:56:26,589 --> 01:56:28,189
You are ... Mentor?

897
01:56:28,949 --> 01:56:30,549
When I want ... Yes!

898
01:56:31,629 --> 01:56:34,149
You spoke very well before the assembly.

899
01:56:34,469 --> 01:56:36,149
You have kept your presence of mind ...

900
01:56:36,269 --> 01:56:39,349
and you have wisely used ... to get the boat.

901
01:56:39,949 --> 01:56:41,509
But you did not help!

902
01:56:44,869 --> 01:56:48,229
Remember this: the gods will never 
do for a man ...

903
01:56:48,309 --> 01:56:50,829
what a man should do by itself.

904
01:56:53,669 --> 01:56:55,709
You must make this journey.

905
01:56:58,549 --> 01:57:00,109
This wind t'emm훾nera.

906
01:57:00,869 --> 01:57:01,869
Go!

907
01:57:01,949 --> 01:57:04,469
Leave before the ship 
n'appareille without you!

908
01:57:08,549 --> 01:57:10,389
- R Sparta! 
- R Sparta.

909
01:57:17,109 --> 01:57:18,109
Sparta ...

910
01:57:18,189 --> 01:57:19,189
Menelaus!

911
01:57:20,109 --> 01:57:22,189
What will I say nearest such a man?

912
01:57:22,429 --> 01:57:24,909
Use your wisdom ... I will guide you.

913
01:57:25,629 --> 01:57:27,109
I can not hear!

914
01:57:49,269 --> 01:57:50,789
I am alone now.

915
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:11,389
Forgotten by the outside world,

916
01:58:11,549 --> 01:58:13,549
abandoned by Athena

917
01:58:14,429 --> 01:58:17,189
I hope to see Penelope ...

918
01:58:17,269 --> 01:58:18,909
nearest began to faint.

919
01:58:48,709 --> 01:58:50,669
- Herm훾s ... 
- In Person!

920
01:58:55,149 --> 01:58:56,229
Get out of here!

921
01:58:56,749 --> 01:58:57,749
Calypso!

922
01:59:01,829 --> 01:59:03,629
You keep a man prisoner.

923
01:59:03,949 --> 01:59:05,429
I gave him a home!

924
01:59:05,509 --> 01:59:09,069
The fate of Ulysses is not to 
end his days on your island.

925
01:59:09,429 --> 01:59:11,909
You have to give him his freedom immediately.

926
01:59:21,149 --> 01:59:24,509
They are outraged to see me openly 
having sex with a mortal ...

927
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:29,749
It was I who shot the sea!

928
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:31,429
Who have dressed his wounds!

929
01:59:31,829 --> 01:59:33,869
You're all jealous of my happiness!

930
01:59:33,949 --> 01:59:36,229
Beware Headline anger of Zeus!

931
01:59:36,549 --> 01:59:38,269
Give this man his freedom r ...

932
01:59:38,309 --> 01:59:41,709
or your island will be engulfed in 
the depths of the sea salt!

933
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:55,829
Stop!

934
01:59:59,549 --> 02:00:01,469
Go find your Penelope.

935
02:00:01,909 --> 02:00:02,909
Why?

936
02:00:03,749 --> 02:00:05,149
A ship docked?

937
02:00:05,669 --> 02:00:06,749
No.

938
02:00:06,909 --> 02:00:08,109
Now go!

939
02:00:08,189 --> 02:00:09,189
Swim!

940
02:00:09,829 --> 02:00:11,269
I do not care!

941
02:00:15,629 --> 02:00:17,469
I do not want to see you!

942
02:00:24,149 --> 02:00:26,109
And now you want me to leave?

943
02:00:27,669 --> 02:00:29,589
You're not worthy of me.

944
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:31,349
Why have woven this?

945
02:00:33,389 --> 02:00:34,909
Someone came to see you?

946
02:00:45,309 --> 02:00:47,389
Nearest you must help me build a boat.

947
02:00:50,589 --> 02:00:51,949
Please.

948
02:00:52,109 --> 02:00:53,309
If you
-like
-...

949
02:01:01,749 --> 02:01:04,109
Build it on the beach or you failed ...

950
02:01:04,709 --> 02:01:06,189
where I found you.

951
02:02:08,469 --> 02:02:09,909
Take it, take it!

952
02:02:12,269 --> 02:02:13,589
Fresh meat ...

953
02:02:19,389 --> 02:02:20,949
Fresh meat ...

954
02:02:22,829 --> 02:02:25,309
I'll find a piece ...

955
02:02:58,589 --> 02:03:00,789
Are not you afraid of me ...

956
02:03:06,349 --> 02:03:08,149
Because you're a woman.

957
02:03:09,309 --> 02:03:12,109
I came to offer you some wine.

958
02:03:14,069 --> 02:03:15,669
Just a few drops.

959
02:03:26,829 --> 02:03:27,869
Tell me ...

960
02:03:27,949 --> 02:03:30,669
What prevents your mistress to 
complete the tapestry?

961
02:03:30,749 --> 02:03:31,749
More ...

962
02:03:38,349 --> 02:03:39,909
It's a secret!

963
02:03:40,629 --> 02:03:42,309
It's a secret ...

964
02:04:05,589 --> 02:04:06,629
M챕lanth챕e?

965
02:04:13,909 --> 02:04:15,349
M챕lanth챕e, where are you?

966
02:04:23,349 --> 02:04:24,349
M챕lanth챕e!

967
02:04:46,429 --> 02:04:49,829
I did not mean to scare you 
into entering your room but ...

968
02:04:49,909 --> 02:04:51,629
I had to track.

969
02:04:55,869 --> 02:04:56,869
Leave me alone.

970
02:05:02,509 --> 02:05:04,629
It's a bad idea ...

971
02:05:05,469 --> 02:05:07,389
All this will draw you into trouble.

972
02:05:07,469 --> 02:05:11,789
I will say nothing, but your servant ...

973
02:05:11,869 --> 02:05:13,229
r could tell others.

974
02:05:13,309 --> 02:05:14,389
M챕lanth챕e!

975
02:05:23,349 --> 02:05:25,909
I have no choice.

976
02:05:38,469 --> 02:05:41,949
For too long a man does not touched thee.

977
02:05:44,429 --> 02:05:45,909
Very long.

978
02:05:55,709 --> 02:05:58,389
The other came to your wealth.

979
02:06:02,589 --> 02:06:03,869
I can not!

980
02:06:04,589 --> 02:06:06,469
I love my husband.

981
02:06:07,829 --> 02:06:09,429
Your husband ...

982
02:06:09,829 --> 02:06:11,949
is no longer alive.

983
02:06:19,149 --> 02:06:21,709
or my son gives me proof.

984
02:06:28,349 --> 02:06:30,589
I'm sorry.

985
02:06:32,109 --> 02:06:35,469
It is I who have no choice.

986
02:07:00,629 --> 02:07:01,909
I'm sorry.

987
02:07:43,509 --> 02:07:45,109
Your wife was old, Odysseus,

988
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:48,709
time was on his work, its 
beauty will not equal mine.

989
02:07:53,789 --> 02:07:56,349
No mortal can match your beauty.

990
02:07:57,789 --> 02:07:59,309
I love Penelope.

991
02:08:01,389 --> 02:08:03,669
She has aged ...

992
02:08:06,749 --> 02:08:09,149
When I joined Ithaca ...

993
02:08:09,749 --> 02:08:11,509
we grow old together.

994
02:08:18,589 --> 02:08:20,629
With me, you never grow old!

995
02:08:20,989 --> 02:08:22,589
You will never die!

996
02:08:23,869 --> 02:08:26,149
I can make you immortal!

997
02:08:34,309 --> 02:08:39,349
I prefers to live my mortal life in 
the arms of my wife ...

998
02:08:39,829 --> 02:08:42,189
rather than live forever without it.

999
02:09:52,629 --> 02:09:55,269
Who is this boy that my son ram훾ne?

1000
02:09:55,629 --> 02:09:58,349
Telemachus of Ithaca Menelaus.

1001
02:10:01,549 --> 02:10:03,829
You are welcome nearest Sparta abroad.

1002
02:10:05,909 --> 02:10:07,309
Here the king ...

1003
02:10:07,389 --> 02:10:08,389
Go!

1004
02:10:13,429 --> 02:10:14,789
Grand King Menelaus ...

1005
02:10:15,469 --> 02:10:18,149
I undertook a long journey to meet you.

1006
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:22,909
You have the prying eyes of your father!

1007
02:10:23,429 --> 02:10:26,549
The same stubborn broad front ...

1008
02:10:29,909 --> 02:10:30,909
Yes ...

1009
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:39,429
Oh, yes!

1010
02:10:40,349 --> 02:10:43,669
You are the son of Odysseus, without a doubt!

1011
02:10:45,909 --> 02:10:48,669
I left the kingdom of Ithaca to find it.

1012
02:10:50,509 --> 02:10:51,949
Can you help me?

1013
02:10:58,589 --> 02:10:59,629
You know ...

1014
02:11:01,149 --> 02:11:04,269
I saw you the day you were born.

1015
02:11:05,349 --> 02:11:09,429
This day
-LR, your father was most proud of 
but also the saddest of men.

1016
02:11:10,349 --> 02:11:14,109
We fought set R Trojan ... rated R side ...

1017
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:18,909
Looking down our brothers ...

1018
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:22,189
Your father stopped the carnage.

1019
02:11:23,549 --> 02:11:26,469
It allowed us to return to Greece.

1020
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:35,589
he will never see his homeland.

1021
02:11:37,269 --> 02:11:38,269
He died.

1022
02:11:43,149 --> 02:11:44,589
How do you know?

1023
02:11:45,629 --> 02:11:47,429
It did not happen one day ...

1024
02:11:49,789 --> 02:11:52,389
while fighting the Trojans ...

1025
02:11:52,589 --> 02:11:55,829
it has no nearest you thought 
your mother and R.

1026
02:11:56,789 --> 02:11:58,349
Only death ...

1027
02:11:58,509 --> 02:12:01,069
could prevent him from 
returning nearest Ithaca.

1028
02:12:01,669 --> 02:12:02,829
But you ...

1029
02:12:03,309 --> 02:12:06,549
You, Telemachus, you must go.

1030
02:12:07,549 --> 02:12:09,069
You must fight!

1031
02:12:11,549 --> 02:12:13,109
And yours!

1032
02:12:14,509 --> 02:12:15,629
Now ...

1033
02:12:16,109 --> 02:12:17,389
pars.

1034
02:13:15,589 --> 02:13:17,309
Poseidon!

1035
02:13:24,269 --> 02:13:25,829
Poseidon!

1036
02:13:32,389 --> 02:13:33,509
Poseidon!

1037
02:13:36,349 --> 02:13:38,069
What do you want?

1038
02:13:46,309 --> 02:13:48,349
Poseidon!

1039
02:13:50,149 --> 02:13:52,509
What do you want from me?

1040
02:13:54,709 --> 02:13:59,509
I want you to suffer!

1041
02:14:05,469 --> 02:14:07,629
It only remains for me nothing!

1042
02:14:08,709 --> 02:14:10,429
I have nothing!

1043
02:14:15,229 --> 02:14:17,829
It remains for me more than life!

1044
02:14:19,629 --> 02:14:24,909
My purpose is not to kill you.

1045
02:14:25,789 --> 02:14:29,589
You must understand.

1046
02:14:34,389 --> 02:14:35,389
What?

1047
02:14:35,509 --> 02:14:36,509
What?

1048
02:14:36,709 --> 02:14:38,829
What? What?

1049
02:14:39,549 --> 02:14:41,469
What do you expect from me?

1050
02:14:42,509 --> 02:14:45,229
What do you want me to understand?

1051
02:14:53,829 --> 02:14:55,149
Talk to me!

1052
02:14:59,949 --> 02:15:03,389
man is nothing.

1053
02:15:24,549 --> 02:15:25,469
Come see!

1054
02:16:05,629 --> 02:16:07,509
I was alive.

1055
02:16:11,269 --> 02:16:13,189
and still far from Ithaca.

1056
02:16:14,269 --> 02:16:15,589
But I was alive!

1057
02:16:17,109 --> 02:16:19,389
I had reached the Phaeacia ...

1058
02:16:22,709 --> 02:16:25,549
Unsure of the reception that 
I would be booked,

1059
02:16:25,629 --> 02:16:28,509
I was taken to the palace 
of the monarch ...

1060
02:16:52,269 --> 02:16:54,829
I shared my food with you ...

1061
02:17:00,149 --> 02:17:01,829
- Your name? 
- I can not.

1062
02:17:07,189 --> 02:17:10,549
Let it pass my lips that 
does not cause you torment.

1063
02:17:12,589 --> 02:17:15,389
I know that a hero is long gone ...

1064
02:17:15,469 --> 02:17:19,269
nearest that could have survived a 
curse from the gods.

1065
02:17:19,709 --> 02:17:22,589
Ulysses is a thousand tricks ...

1066
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:37,469
It's me.

1067
02:17:38,949 --> 02:17:42,869
I never imagined Odysseus meet in person!

1068
02:17:44,469 --> 02:17:45,709
It is an honor!

1069
02:17:45,789 --> 02:17:47,309
For the Phaeacia!

1070
02:17:47,389 --> 02:17:51,189
A hero like Odysseus of Ithaca seat among us!

1071
02:17:51,389 --> 02:17:54,149
I'll give you the best of my ships ...

1072
02:17:54,269 --> 02:17:58,429
with presents and food, and 
the best sailors Phaeacia,

1073
02:17:58,629 --> 02:18:00,629
for you home!

1074
02:18:03,829 --> 02:18:06,669
The Phaeacians led me jusqu'흻 Ithaca.

1075
02:18:14,149 --> 02:18:19,509
I understood that I was a 
man, among many others.

1076
02:18:20,349 --> 02:18:21,749
No more ...

1077
02:18:21,909 --> 02:18:23,309
no less.

1078
02:18:27,109 --> 02:18:29,189
This is his fourth sleepless night.

1079
02:18:30,149 --> 02:18:32,429
His body will abandon nearest Ithaca!

1080
02:18:32,829 --> 02:18:34,149
Pantinos!

1081
02:18:34,389 --> 02:18:35,629
Come see!

1082
02:18:40,909 --> 02:18:42,829
Prepare a potion of sleep.

1083
02:19:07,629 --> 02:19:08,829
Drink this.

1084
02:20:29,909 --> 02:20:31,149
Who is there?

1085
02:21:14,669 --> 02:21:16,189
My cheese ...

1086
02:21:26,349 --> 02:21:27,749
My wine ...

1087
02:21:30,829 --> 02:21:32,669
Master, it's you!

1088
02:21:35,389 --> 02:21:36,389
My bread.

1089
02:21:41,909 --> 02:21:42,909
Master ...

1090
02:21:45,229 --> 02:21:46,269
Eumaeus!

1091
02:21:55,669 --> 02:21:56,669
I ...

1092
02:22:35,349 --> 02:22:36,389
Eumaeus!

1093
02:22:39,709 --> 02:22:40,909
Who is it?

1094
02:22:42,349 --> 02:22:45,109
- Party a year ago to find you. 
- Go, go and am훾ne it!

1095
02:22:45,309 --> 02:22:46,309
Telemachus!

1096
02:22:48,069 --> 02:22:49,269
You've changed!

1097
02:22:49,349 --> 02:22:52,309
- Tell me, how is my mother? 
- She will be happy to see you again.

1098
02:22:52,389 --> 02:22:54,109
But come! Tell me about your trip!

1099
02:22:54,189 --> 02:22:55,789
Later, I must go and see.

1100
02:22:56,389 --> 02:22:57,389
Telemachus!

1101
02:22:59,309 --> 02:23:00,309
Who is it?

1102
02:23:00,389 --> 02:23:02,789
- Who is there? 
- It's your father.

1103
02:23:03,749 --> 02:23:06,749
How dare you say those words? 
Get out of here!

1104
02:23:15,789 --> 02:23:17,709
You can not be my father.

1105
02:23:18,309 --> 02:23:21,909
- Ulysses is dead! 
- Odysseus is alive ...

1106
02:23:23,349 --> 02:23:25,229
and it is before you.

1107
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:26,429
Do not approach!

1108
02:23:26,749 --> 02:23:27,829
I beg you ...

1109
02:23:29,909 --> 02:23:31,069
Look at me!

1110
02:23:32,709 --> 02:23:34,269
Do not you know you ...

1111
02:23:36,469 --> 02:23:37,749
in my face?

1112
02:23:39,869 --> 02:23:43,749
I see a man with no respect 
for the feelings of a son!

1113
02:23:43,829 --> 02:23:45,589
You are my son ...

1114
02:23:48,229 --> 02:23:50,709
who brought thee in the world, here.

1115
02:23:52,149 --> 02:23:53,629
In this field ... right?

1116
02:23:55,949 --> 02:23:57,349
I carried you ...

1117
02:23:59,629 --> 02:24:01,229
to show you the world ...

1118
02:24:05,709 --> 02:24:08,549
And when fate took away my nearest 
you, your mother and r ...

1119
02:24:09,789 --> 02:24:12,549
I asked you in his arms ...

1120
02:24:12,669 --> 02:24:13,949
in bed ...

1121
02:24:14,629 --> 02:24:17,949
I had built with these hands.

1122
02:24:26,629 --> 02:24:28,429
She had to tell you about it.

1123
02:24:51,509 --> 02:24:52,669
Father ...

1124
02:25:00,629 --> 02:25:01,629
My son ...

1125
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:12,109
My soul is sick!

1126
02:25:12,189 --> 02:25:14,909
These men have CSUR stone! 
They respect nothing!

1127
02:25:14,989 --> 02:25:16,789
- They run like dogs. 
- Yes!

1128
02:25:16,869 --> 02:25:18,389
- They deserve death! 
- Yes!

1129
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:25,149
- For their feast. 
- Ah, never!

1130
02:25:25,229 --> 02:25:28,149
You're going to do ...

1131
02:25:28,229 --> 02:25:31,709
as you have always done.

1132
02:25:40,829 --> 02:25:42,589
Do you trust your sailors?

1133
02:25:42,909 --> 02:25:43,909
No.

1134
02:25:45,229 --> 02:25:47,549
They are men of suitors.

1135
02:25:50,309 --> 02:25:52,629
Tell them you join them later ...

1136
02:25:53,429 --> 02:25:55,429
R people do not say that I came back ...

1137
02:25:59,709 --> 02:26:01,389
Especially not your mother nearest.

1138
02:26:15,789 --> 02:26:17,189
Be patient.

1139
02:26:21,109 --> 02:26:22,629
Use your your mind.

1140
02:26:24,189 --> 02:26:26,349
That's why I love you, my Ulysses!

1141
02:26:38,349 --> 02:26:41,789
- You alone have the patience. 
- So tell me ...

1142
02:26:45,229 --> 02:26:47,349
And rid my home of these men?

1143
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:51,869
- The t'effraient as contenders? 
- I'm not afraid of much.

1144
02:26:55,669 --> 02:26:59,909
- But it's rage. 
- You lie still going strong, Ulysses!

1145
02:27:00,509 --> 02:27:04,109
But I know what your head 
ask your nearest CSUR.

1146
02:27:05,549 --> 02:27:09,189
You fear that your Penelope was 
not t'ait infid훾le ...

1147
02:27:23,429 --> 02:27:25,829
I'm afraid I can not help you ...

1148
02:27:26,589 --> 02:27:27,589
But ...

1149
02:27:43,589 --> 02:27:46,309
Only your son as you recognize these traits.

1150
02:27:53,269 --> 02:27:55,629
Find the answers you seek!

1151
02:28:20,069 --> 02:28:23,549
You will not recognize your house. When 
you see what they have done,

1152
02:28:23,629 --> 02:28:25,909
you want to kill you too!

1153
02:28:41,669 --> 02:28:43,909
The hour of battle has not yet come.

1154
02:28:46,389 --> 02:28:48,349
that anger is easy ...

1155
02:28:50,109 --> 02:28:52,549
but turn against a man ...

1156
02:28:57,189 --> 02:28:59,189
and for good reason ...

1157
02:29:01,629 --> 02:29:03,269
is difficult.

1158
02:29:25,309 --> 02:29:26,349
Silence!

1159
02:29:28,589 --> 02:29:31,869
Our prince is back.

1160
02:29:34,469 --> 02:29:37,349
It is r me! I will tear the 
CSUR and give it to dogs!

1161
02:29:37,429 --> 02:29:39,309
Calm down and think.

1162
02:29:43,149 --> 02:29:46,469
- He will not dare, my voice the barn. 
- Prince Telemachus ...

1163
02:29:46,549 --> 02:29:47,549
Welcome!

1164
02:29:49,709 --> 02:29:52,229
The gods have returned safe and sound.

1165
02:29:52,389 --> 02:29:55,549
He went to fetch his father 
and found a lousy beggar!

1166
02:29:57,189 --> 02:29:59,629
Tell us, why have you 
abandoned your research?

1167
02:30:00,229 --> 02:30:03,949
I went to nearest Sparta where 
King Menelaus told me ...

1168
02:30:07,309 --> 02:30:09,229
He finally understood!

1169
02:30:09,509 --> 02:30:11,509
So you see, we ...

1170
02:30:12,869 --> 02:30:14,749
certain rights ...

1171
02:30:15,549 --> 02:30:16,949
in your house.

1172
02:30:18,229 --> 02:30:21,829
The young prince to go home 
is a man of honor!

1173
02:30:24,229 --> 02:30:26,509
His beard has grown!

1174
02:30:27,389 --> 02:30:32,549
- His first beard ... 
- Sparse ... but it's a beard.

1175
02:30:33,909 --> 02:30:37,469
It's time to enter the circle, 
you're a man now!

1176
02:30:37,549 --> 02:30:40,269
I will accept the challenge of your choice.

1177
02:30:40,789 --> 02:30:43,189
- But first I must see my mother. 
- His mother ...

1178
02:30:43,309 --> 02:30:47,429
Meanwhile, this beggar is my guest. 
R its hungry he eats!

1179
02:30:48,229 --> 02:30:49,349
Take a dish.

1180
02:30:49,429 --> 02:30:50,589
They will serve you ...

1181
02:30:58,349 --> 02:31:01,629
You see ... I've just deliver the kid.

1182
02:31:01,949 --> 02:31:04,669
- I can not kill him in battle! 
- Of course it is!

1183
02:31:04,749 --> 02:31:08,509
As long as he tries to kill you first ...

1184
02:31:21,749 --> 02:31:23,589
I did not find.

1185
02:31:37,629 --> 02:31:39,389
Mother ... You must listen to me:

1186
02:31:39,469 --> 02:31:43,869
I met a wise old man, a beggar. 
It can help us find the nearest.

1187
02:31:44,109 --> 02:31:46,389
When the palace sleep, I tell you am훾nerai.

1188
02:31:46,589 --> 02:31:47,789
I must leave you.

1189
02:31:48,109 --> 02:31:49,469
Antinous challenged me.

1190
02:31:57,749 --> 02:31:59,149
Yes ...

1191
02:31:59,829 --> 02:32:02,189
You're a man now.

1192
02:32:14,509 --> 02:32:16,349
Returns nearest your place, begging!

1193
02:32:49,629 --> 02:32:52,269
Do not be humble!

1194
02:32:52,429 --> 02:32:53,589
Take this ...

1195
02:32:54,549 --> 02:32:56,229
Today is the day!

1196
02:32:59,949 --> 02:33:01,589
Antinous!

1197
02:33:03,789 --> 02:33:05,269
You're dead!

1198
02:33:09,269 --> 02:33:10,429
Go!

1199
02:33:10,509 --> 02:33:11,429
Kill me.

1200
02:33:14,109 --> 02:33:17,349
You wait three years it! Are 
you a man or not?

1201
02:33:19,509 --> 02:33:21,869
No!

1202
02:33:23,709 --> 02:33:26,349
The anger is easy!

1203
02:33:26,869 --> 02:33:27,869
Go!

1204
02:33:28,189 --> 02:33:29,269
Kill me!

1205
02:33:34,469 --> 02:33:36,109
The time has not come.

1206
02:33:36,949 --> 02:33:38,269
Come on, coward!

1207
02:33:38,549 --> 02:33:39,549
Attack me!

1208
02:34:05,589 --> 02:34:08,389
- I'm sorry. 
- There is no shame nearest you.

1209
02:34:10,429 --> 02:34:11,909
Heal your wounds.

1210
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:20,349
Tell your mom nearest you've 
defeated your anger.

1211
02:34:35,269 --> 02:34:37,949
My mistress sent me wash your feet.

1212
02:34:41,789 --> 02:34:43,749
Her son told her ...

1213
02:34:51,149 --> 02:34:52,629
You like this boy?

1214
02:34:53,149 --> 02:34:56,269
His father told me the day of his birth.

1215
02:35:11,869 --> 02:35:12,869
Master!

1216
02:35:13,109 --> 02:35:15,149
Do not talk!

1217
02:35:17,829 --> 02:35:19,949
and all would be lost.

1218
02:35:24,589 --> 02:35:25,589
Eurycleia!

1219
02:35:35,189 --> 02:35:36,309
Queen ...

1220
02:35:37,869 --> 02:35:39,349
Penelope ...

1221
02:35:41,629 --> 02:35:43,429
I wanted to thank you.

1222
02:35:46,669 --> 02:35:48,149
And to tell you ...

1223
02:35:49,309 --> 02:35:52,909
I'm sorry that you t'ait treated 
so badly in my house.

1224
02:35:54,709 --> 02:35:56,829
I am only here for one night.

1225
02:36:01,669 --> 02:36:03,629
what should you seem like an eternity.

1226
02:36:03,709 --> 02:36:04,709
Yes.

1227
02:36:06,269 --> 02:36:10,829
I must stop nearest the ordeal, as 
my son is still alive.

1228
02:36:11,869 --> 02:36:12,869
Tomorrow ...

1229
02:36:13,349 --> 02:36:15,869
I propose a test my nearest contenders.

1230
02:36:17,349 --> 02:36:19,389
You're right.

1231
02:36:23,309 --> 02:36:24,949
I have no desire ...

1232
02:36:25,709 --> 02:36:26,709
but ...

1233
02:36:36,149 --> 02:36:38,389
here ... nearest the place ...

1234
02:36:39,269 --> 02:36:40,349
dearly ...

1235
02:36:43,269 --> 02:36:45,389
He made me promise ...

1236
02:36:46,069 --> 02:36:47,669
to do so.

1237
02:36:49,549 --> 02:36:53,149
This is the last sacrifice I can do for him.

1238
02:36:58,829 --> 02:37:01,229
He is alive, your Odysseus.

1239
02:37:02,869 --> 02:37:04,109
He is alive.

1240
02:37:04,189 --> 02:37:05,109
He knows ...

1241
02:37:06,149 --> 02:37:07,749
your grief ...

1242
02:37:08,829 --> 02:37:10,429
your suffering ...

1243
02:37:12,389 --> 02:37:14,869
and dream to take your hands ...

1244
02:37:14,949 --> 02:37:17,429
kissing your eyes ...

1245
02:37:22,469 --> 02:37:24,149
kiss your lips.

1246
02:37:29,149 --> 02:37:31,389
He will return to defend yourself.

1247
02:37:33,149 --> 02:37:34,149
You'll see ...

1248
02:37:36,629 --> 02:37:37,629
he will return.

1249
02:37:42,189 --> 02:37:44,109
If only you were right!

1250
02:37:49,109 --> 02:37:50,309
Good night.

1251
02:37:58,549 --> 02:38:00,269
Tomorrow!

1252
02:38:02,429 --> 02:38:06,189
I will resume my world.

1253
02:38:37,869 --> 02:38:39,389
Go get the spears.

1254
02:39:49,269 --> 02:39:50,349
Philoetios ...

1255
02:39:59,109 --> 02:40:00,429
Tell us, shepherd ...

1256
02:40:00,749 --> 02:40:04,509
- That frame your mistress? 
- You will all know.

1257
02:40:18,589 --> 02:40:20,709
The man who reaches R the bend ...

1258
02:40:20,789 --> 02:40:25,749
and r send an arrow through the rings 
nearest of the twelve axes ...

1259
02:40:26,269 --> 02:40:27,509
take its place.

1260
02:40:27,589 --> 02:40:28,589
What?

1261
02:40:29,749 --> 02:40:31,589
Strange way to choose!

1262
02:40:34,949 --> 02:40:36,829
It is infeasible!

1263
02:40:36,989 --> 02:40:38,549
My father did!

1264
02:40:42,309 --> 02:40:43,309
Wait!

1265
02:40:43,909 --> 02:40:46,149
Wait, or you will not see the winner!

1266
02:40:47,509 --> 02:40:49,309
For me, all you're worth.

1267
02:40:50,909 --> 02:40:52,149
It's not fair!

1268
02:40:53,309 --> 02:40:56,389
I never laid a bow! It's not fair!

1269
02:40:59,309 --> 02:41:00,789
One hundred goats!

1270
02:41:01,149 --> 02:41:04,349
- As present, Dulikhion! 
- So go there, fool!

1271
02:41:04,749 --> 02:41:06,309
That's impossible!

1272
02:41:07,429 --> 02:41:09,469
- It will not make it! 
- Come and help me ...

1273
02:41:11,229 --> 02:41:13,509
Only two trials, Eurymachus!

1274
02:41:14,509 --> 02:41:16,189
- You can do it! 
- Go!

1275
02:41:16,269 --> 02:41:17,629
No, he can not.

1276
02:41:18,389 --> 02:41:20,229
- Go, go! 
- No!

1277
02:41:28,149 --> 02:41:29,829
Farewell, Ulysses.

1278
02:41:30,949 --> 02:41:32,789
I kept my word.

1279
02:41:39,629 --> 02:41:41,109
And we lock up!

1280
02:41:44,949 --> 02:41:45,949
Quick, quick!

1281
02:41:48,549 --> 02:41:50,189
Hide them, hide them!

1282
02:42:11,189 --> 02:42:14,309
I have waited long enough! Pass 
it on me, wimps!

1283
02:42:14,509 --> 02:42:16,109
Now look at that!

1284
02:42:17,149 --> 02:42:19,429
Go ahead, Antinous, show us how!

1285
02:42:19,869 --> 02:42:20,869
Go!

1286
02:42:22,109 --> 02:42:23,109
Go!

1287
02:42:30,589 --> 02:42:33,709
If I can not, then no man living there come!

1288
02:42:42,469 --> 02:42:44,269
And a dead man?

1289
02:43:38,469 --> 02:43:40,069
What are you doing?

1290
02:43:50,069 --> 02:43:51,629
Do not be stupid!

1291
02:43:53,189 --> 02:43:54,629
Who are you, old man?

1292
02:44:13,669 --> 02:44:14,749
Odysseus ...

1293
02:44:17,469 --> 02:44:18,669
Ulysses!

1294
02:44:31,629 --> 02:44:33,109
Telemachus ...

1295
02:44:36,149 --> 02:44:38,789
Now it is time to unleash your anger.

1296
02:45:09,309 --> 02:45:10,549
Wait, wait!

1297
02:45:10,789 --> 02:45:11,789
Wait!

1298
02:45:18,709 --> 02:45:21,789
We have treated your wife like a queen.

1299
02:45:22,669 --> 02:45:25,589
We have lived in your land, 
but it can be repaired,

1300
02:45:25,669 --> 02:45:26,869
we ...

1301
02:45:26,949 --> 02:45:28,589
killed anyone.

1302
02:45:29,829 --> 02:45:33,949
Your crime is to have tried 
to steal my world ...

1303
02:45:35,549 --> 02:45:39,109
The world that I built with my hands ...

1304
02:45:39,429 --> 02:45:40,829
with my sweat ...

1305
02:45:40,949 --> 02:45:43,149
- No ... 
- ... and my blood.

1306
02:45:44,389 --> 02:45:47,389
The world I shared with a woman ...

1307
02:45:48,549 --> 02:45:50,589
who gave me my son ...

1308
02:45:58,149 --> 02:46:00,109
you will all die ...

1309
02:46:01,549 --> 02:46:02,789
in a bloodbath.

1310
02:46:02,869 --> 02:46:03,829
A bloodbath!

1311
02:46:08,229 --> 02:46:09,229
Spears!

1312
02:46:09,309 --> 02:46:11,709
We must not be slaughtered like sheep!

1313
02:46:34,789 --> 02:46:36,309
M챕lanth챕e!

1314
02:46:37,109 --> 02:46:38,949
Open the door!

1315
02:46:39,469 --> 02:46:41,269
M챕lanth챕e!

1316
02:46:42,469 --> 02:46:43,469
M챕lanth챕e!

1317
02:46:44,789 --> 02:46:46,549
Open the door!

1318
02:46:57,749 --> 02:46:58,749
Father!

1319
02:47:53,669 --> 02:47:56,589
Prevents your mother entering the room.

1320
02:47:58,509 --> 02:48:00,309
When everything is purified ...

1321
02:48:01,829 --> 02:48:03,549
tell him that I came back.

1322
02:48:26,909 --> 02:48:27,909
Ulysses!

1323
02:49:50,229 --> 02:49:52,269
I never left.

1324
02:50:10,589 --> 02:50:12,629
I had to change a lot ...

1325
02:50:13,309 --> 02:50:14,309
Not ...

1326
02:50:16,709 --> 02:50:18,549
You're still the same.

1327
02:50:21,229 --> 02:50:23,869
You're still a liar, Ulysses!

1328
02:50:26,709 --> 02:50:29,989
You had not seen for twenty years ...

1329
02:50:30,429 --> 02:50:32,589
No, one day ...

1330
02:50:36,309 --> 02:50:39,469
- You've gone around the Earth. 
- Yes.

1331
02:50:39,949 --> 02:50:43,389
Randomly out of my way, I saw 
the sacred and the beautiful ...

1332
02:50:43,869 --> 02:50:47,189
but nothing can match the treasure 
of a man ...

1333
02:50:47,749 --> 02:50:49,949
A treasure he holds in his hands ...

1334
02:50:50,829 --> 02:50:52,789
and will be hers forever.

1335
02:51:03,589 --> 02:51:05,549
You are my universe.
