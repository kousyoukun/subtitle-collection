1
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,634
Take care
on di road, Nesta.

2
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,093
Is it true
your family has been threatened?

3
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,162
Jamaica is
on the brink of civil war.

4
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,538
They say
Edward Seaga is affiliated
with the CIA.

5
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,002
Do you think this will
impact the election?

6
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,478
Jamaica's been
in turmoil for 14 years.

7
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,282
<i>Why get involved
in politics now?</i>

8
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:47,076
Mr. Marley, please,
tell us whose side are you on?

9
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,720
All right, settle down,
settle down.

10
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:56,690
Smile Jamaica
is a non-political event.

11
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,791
A free concert that Bob Marley
has planned

12
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,727
for all di people dem.

13
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,234
My goal is to unify di people

14
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,962
through the message
of His Imperial Majesty,

15
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:06,700
Emperor Haile Selassie I,

16
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:10,704
King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
Earth's rightful ruler.

17
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,739
Rastafari.

18
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:15,379
Do you really believe music
can end the violence

19
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:17,645
when the government
has been unable?

20
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,614
Well, every government

21
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,386
pon di face of dis earth
is illegal, man.

22
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,652
Not one of dem is legal.

23
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:27,589
That's why mi don't deal
wid no politics.

24
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,328
And, yeah, reggae music
come to feed a revolution

25
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:32,264
that no guns can stop.

26
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,157
You're not concerned you'll
be seen as choosing sides

27
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,060
when you have gang leaders
like Bucky Marshall

28
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,733
and Claudie Massop fomenting
violence on the streets

29
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,702
and both political parties
are involved?

30
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:45,706
Mi tell di people mi a go play,
so mi a go play.

31
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,103

that you doin' this concert

122
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,183
I really don't think you should
go through with this concert.

123
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,691
Chris, listen.
There's no way we back down.

That's Bob's decision though,
isn't it?

Thank you, Don.

126

Let me go help this woman.
Yeah, man.

127

Be right back.
All right.

Oh, yeah? And what dem say?

130
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,198
Apparently I have been
associating with someone

131
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,574
who could destabilize
the country.

132
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:43,839
Who, me?

133
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,843
Bob, listen to me.
This is bigger than Jamaica.

Tell me, what is this big

487
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,562

and go in a different headspace
fi dis one.

489

Mi really need fi add
another sound to di band.

490
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,064
Yu can think of anyone?

491
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,769
Leave it with me.

492
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,672
Just make sure we have
a good engineer

493

and mi will take care
of di rest.

I'll make some calls.

495
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,250
Music will run like river.

496
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,362
Mm-mm.

497
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:44,563

'Cause to mi dat sound like

501
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:51,240

for di last four hours.

502
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:52,637
Yu know what I mean?
Is different

504
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,037
Carly, yu know di meanin'
of dis song?

505
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:58,775
Yeah, man.

506
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,810
"There's a natural mystic
blowin' through di air."

507
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:04,748
"There is a natural mystic
blowin' through di air."

508
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:06,651
Right?
"If yu listen carefully now..."

509
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:09,082
"If yu listen carefully now,
you will hear.

510
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:11,524
Dis could be di first trumpet...

511
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,691
...but it might as well
be di last.

512
00:35:13,726 --> 00:35:15,726
Many more
will have to suffer.

513
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:16,991
Many more will have to die.

514
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:19,400
Don't ask me why."

515
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,534
It's a revelation now!

516
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:24,933
Because di time is now.

517
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,836
We don't want our children
come suffer

518
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,069
inna di streets again
like how we suffered.

519
00:35:29,104 --> 00:35:31,478
Never. True, never.
Nah, man!

520
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,612
And music can lead di way.

521
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,219
And you drinkin' Red Stripe.
Yu giddyheaded.

"Like a fog."

00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,899
All right, come, Tyrone.

<i>What do you say?

551
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:08,344
Why yu ask me dat, Bob?

563
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:52,784
Junior's been recording
with Stevie Wonder.

564
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,788
Big shot, dat.

565

Skippa, what make yu feel

Dem don't hafi like it.

00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,464
Dem just hafi hear it,

568

Mm.

00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:07,337
I agree, Bob. I think this
could be very special.

571
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,471
Where yu born, Junior?

572
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:11,935
Jamaican-born, British-raised.

573
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,971
Jazz, soul and rock and roll,
Junior Marvin's in control.

574
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,303
Rasta is in control.

575
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,711
A lyrics man.

576
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:21,076
English bwoy are different,
yu know, man.

577
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:23,243
"No chains around my feet,
but I'm not free.

578
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:25,982
I know I am bound here
in captivity."

579
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:28,556
It's one of my favorite lyrics
from "Catch a Fire."

580
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:29,821
It's really good.

581
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:30,921
Good.

582
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:33,286

00:38:36,324 --> 00:38:38,258
Di man curl up, curl up.

585
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:40,502
Mi just a joke with yu, brethren.

586
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,473
What yu know about Rasta?
Yeah, tell him now, Skip.

587
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:45,969
Yu know yu Bible?

588
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:48,642
I know Matthew, Mark,
Luke and John.

589
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:50,941
But music is my passion, Bob.

590
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:54,274
For we, di music and di message
are di same thing.

591
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:56,342
Can't separate.

592
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,751
No, man. It's I and I right
to live in unity.

593
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:02,854
Yes, man.
Dis reggae music is di vehicle.

Little less psychedelic.

605
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,163
Yeah, man, make him play.
Him can play.

Yu nuh like it.

820
00:52:27,924 --> 00:52:31,167
No, I, uh-- I do.
It's, uh-- It's striking.

821
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:37,338
I'm a little concerned you can't
read the name of the band.

822
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:40,176
And there's no photo of Bob.
So...

823
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:43,806
Mi not inna dis thing
fi my ego, brethren.

824

Mi in it because, yu know--

825
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:49,515
Mi in it because of a cause.

826
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:51,649
Um...

827
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:54,146
I'm sorry, say again?

828
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:56,357
What do you, um...

829
00:52:56,392 --> 00:52:58,227
What do you think about it, Bob?

830
00:52:59,824 --> 00:53:01,560
Mi love it.
Rastafari.

831
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,530
It's beautiful, man. Beautiful.
Give thanks. Give thanks.

832
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:08,831
Bob, I commend your humility,
but we need to sell records.

833
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,240
Album cover sell record?

834
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:15,134
I mean, Neville, tell 'em
what yu wanna tell 'em.

835
00:53:15,169 --> 00:53:17,202
Finish yu thing
about your artwork.

836
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:20,777
The first cover
was a bit busy, seen?

837
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:22,350
Dis one more simple.

838
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:24,209
<i>"Exodus."</i>

839
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:28,213
The title is derived from
the Ethiopian Amharic script.

840
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,457
Appearing less,

841
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:32,393
but meaning more.

842
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,462
Right.
Know what I mean?

843
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:38,960
But it looks like
a Cecil B. DeMille poster.

844
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:42,337
I mean,
this isn't Sunday school.

845
00:53:42,372 --> 00:53:44,273
We...

846
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:46,638
I've read the Bible.

847
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:48,772
Christ, I had to
memorize half of it

848
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:51,874
and I can tell you
one thing for sure:

849
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:55,207
Young people do not like it.

850
00:53:55,242 --> 00:53:57,616
You know?

851
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:06,053
Thanks, Howard.
Let's move on, shall we? Um...

852
00:54:06,088 --> 00:54:10,189
Let's talk about
the European tour dates.

853
00:54:10,224 --> 00:54:12,224
What yu tell dem
about the Africa tour date dem?

854
00:54:12,259 --> 00:54:14,996
Africa?
Yeah, Africa.

855
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:16,569
It's in di Bible, too,
yu know.

856
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:19,231
Or dat is the half
you never memorize?

857
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:20,738
I leave
for Africa next month,

858
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:22,905
to talk to the promoters,
see what they need,

859
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,710
what they want,
check out the venues.

860
00:54:25,745 --> 00:54:27,272

I'll call you later.

866
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,183
Bob.

867
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,220

868
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:43,629
Yeah, man. Don tell mi you

tour date dem, yu know?

873
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:54,508
We have ten shows
already lined up

874
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:56,477
in the States for after Europe.

875
00:54:56,512 --> 00:54:58,072
It's an important audience.

876
00:54:58,107 --> 00:55:00,844
You'll reach millions
of Black Americans there.

877
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:04,650
Look, I've been to Africa.
There's no infrastructure there.

878
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:07,620
So we build it.

879
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:09,523
Yu know?

880
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:12,152
We can build it.

Yes, man.

883

All right. I hope you're right.

884
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:22,998

I need more
than a house and a car.

01:09:33,685 --> 01:09:35,355

my own opportunities?

You'll kill him, Skip.

Dat's cool, dat's cool.

Put it down.

1211

You're lucky.

1212
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:09,051

Get up, Don. Come on.

1215

01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:25,463
Oh, God.

1220
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,005
Nobody create
no excitement, Chris.

1221
01:15:29,744 --> 01:15:32,338
Bob, you need to see a doctor.

1222
01:15:40,018 --> 01:15:42,051
Two sevens clash.

1223
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,515
I'm sorry?

1224
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:47,595
Two sevens clash.

1225
01:15:48,994 --> 01:15:52,490
Marcus Garvey say on the day
the two sevens clash,

1226
01:15:52,525 --> 01:15:55,834
di ruled will rise up
'gainst di rulers.

1227
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:59,739
Seventh of July 1977.

1228
01:15:59,774 --> 01:16:00,839
Huh.

1229
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:03,743
Mr. Marley,

1230
01:16:05,043 --> 01:16:07,043
did you understand
what I've said?

1231
01:16:08,783 --> 01:16:09,848
Uh-huh.

1232
01:16:12,413 --> 01:16:14,116
You said it's cancer.

1233
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:18,318
Acral Lentiginous Melanoma.

1234
01:16:18,353 --> 01:16:20,056
It's a skin cancer.

1235
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:30,363
Mi can't get skin cancer
from a man stepping on mi toe.

1236
01:16:31,938 --> 01:16:35,973
Well, the injury to your foot
isn't the cause.

1237
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:39,537
But the fact that it won't heal
is the result of the illness.

1238
01:16:39,572 --> 01:16:41,682
It's very rare.

1239
01:16:41,717 --> 01:16:44,047
Do you know
if it runs in your family?

1240
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:47,380
No. My faada
was a white man.

1241
01:16:48,482 --> 01:16:50,350

1254
01:18:51,737 --> 01:18:54,507
Bob, you have to
listen to the doctors.

1255
01:18:55,884 --> 01:18:57,576
This is your health.

1256
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:01,514
And look,
if it heals quick enough,

1257
01:19:01,549 --> 01:19:03,384
then we can make
the American tour.

1258
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,287
You won't have to
miss any of it.
