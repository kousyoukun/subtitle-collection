00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,429
[crowd chanting]
Marley! Marley! Marley!

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,304
Where you want to start?

3
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,434
From the beginning.

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,065
Reggae’s a people music.

5
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:26,275
People coming together.

6
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,234
Ooh yeah.

7
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:34,824
You know you’re a superstar.

8
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,369
I ain’t a superstar.

9
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,089
There's a war going on.

10
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,180
You can't separate the music
and the message.

11
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,766
And what is the message?

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,894
Peace.

13
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:07,023
[gunfire]

14
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:14,530
Bob, they tried to kill you and your wife

15
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,743
and now you're choosing
to return to Jamaica

16
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,744
to play a peace concert?

17
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,832
Don't you fear for your life?

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,389
My life is not important to me.

19
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,771
My life is for people.

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,606
Do you really think this world
will make it?

21
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,651
Yes.

22
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,070
There's no other way.

23
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,742
That's the source of your strength.

24
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:49,585
One love, one heart, one destiny.
