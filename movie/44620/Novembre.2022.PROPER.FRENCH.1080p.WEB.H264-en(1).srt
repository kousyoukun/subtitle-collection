1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,165
This movie is based on true
happened facts but remains fiction.

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:06,607
None of this can be used
be before the court.

3
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:12,678
ATHENS

4
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:23,040
Coffee?
- Yes please. But not too much.

5
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:27,346
Since what time have you been awake?
- Since 08:00.

6
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:29,744
Do you want something too?
- Yes please.

7
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:07,124
You work hard. You must be tired.

8
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,710
I'll be right back.

9
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:38,711
Is this the right floor?

10
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,787
Everything is secured.
Send the French in.

11
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:37,655
He's not here.

12
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,703
Put them on the couch.

13
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,175
Where is he?
- I do not understand you.

14
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,331
Abdelhamid Abaaoud.

15
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,113
I do not understand you.
- Not?

16
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,688
Look closely at the photo.
- Ahmed?

17
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,577
Where is he? Do you know him?

18
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:59,544
I don't know anything about him.
- Where is he?

19
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:03,463
Maybe he's on the roof?

20
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,763
Do you have anything down there?

21
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,346
We have nothing to report.

22
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:43,684
He's not here.
- Not then?

23
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:45,185
This was it.

24
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,000
SDAT 3, Athens. 09:48

25
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,666
Attempt to arrest Abaaoud ended.

26
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,125
Failed.

27
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:11,220
PARIS
10 MONTHS EARLY

28
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,958
Yes?

29
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:05,291
To all units.
Gunfire in the 10th arrondissement.

30
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,208
I repeat: gunshots
in the 10th arrondissement.

31
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,208
We return. Yes Marc?
- Two bombs in the Stade de France?

32
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,500
Héloïse speaks with the prefecture.
Call everyone to the office.

33
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,291
And gunshots in it
10th arrondissement? Where exactly?

34
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,208
Rue Bichat and Rue de la Fontaine au Roi.
So 10th and 11th.

35
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,041
At least two men shoot
from cars to the crowd.

36
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,500
Stay tuned. Are there any injuries?
- You're not high, are you?

37
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,708
Large caliber. Reinforcements requested.

38
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,250
It's a war scene.

39
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,250
Automatic weapons.
- Send reinforcements.

40
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,125
Anti-terrorist unit, I'm listening.

41
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,500
All briefing monitors in room F.

42
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,750
One commando is in the Stade
de France and the other in Paris.

43
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,553
In the 11th, shots were fired at the 'Carillon'.

44
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,791
Rue de la Fontaine au Roi en
Rue de Charonne.

45
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,000
Séverine, to the Stade de France.
Sébastien to the 10th arrondissement.

46
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,625
Terrorists invaded the Bataclan.
In the middle of a concert.

47
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,836
France must remain strong against
this wave of terror.

48
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,916
Marco, are you after the terraces
got into the Bataclan?

49
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,750
How many attackers are there in total?

50
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,291
Is anyone injured?

51
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,041
Marco, I'll call you back. Yes?

52
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,250
Fred, prepare the RAID and the BRI
prepares to storm the Bataclan.

53
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,059
We already know about
the number of victims?

54
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,416
Not exactly yet. About 30 in Paris.
But we know nothing about the Bataclan.

55
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,750
We must mobilize everyone.
- Everyone's on their way.

56
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,580
I have all available powers
advanced and mobilized.

57
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:18,099
We need these terrorists
stop as soon as possible.

58
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,154
We need safety in all
to re-insure affected places.

59
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,492
I also decided to
to close the borders.

60
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,291
Mission canceled in Les Halles.
False alarm.

61
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,000
No, false alarm. How's the situation?

62
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,916
On the rue de la Fontaine au Roi
they search the cellars.

63
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:41,096
Compatriots, my thoughts go out
to all victims.

64
00:10:41,135 --> 00:10:44,288
But also to the families of
those who were injured.

65
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:47,477
There are dozens of deaths.
It's terrible.

66
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,541
I need a schedule.
- How is the situation?

67
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,500
It's two or three commands.

68
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,041
One in the Stade de France and
one in the 10th.

69
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,291
They're in the Bataclan.
One remained on Boulevard Voltaire.

70
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,000
Rue Bichat to Nation and then Bataclan?

71
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,958
We check the timing.
- Who coordinates the emergency calls?

72
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,083
One unit but the network is overloaded.

73
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,958
The hotline 197 has been activated.

74
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,041
The information flow is not allowed
end in chaos.

75
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,458
The Bataclan is stormed.

76
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:21,122
Storm at this very moment
law enforcement a building in Paris.

77
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:29,056
The army is deployed to
prevent new attacks.

78
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,708
I'm in the ministry.
I'll call you back. Good evening.

79
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:37,850
Keep having faith in it
that our security services...

80
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:40,392
do everything for our nation
to guard against terror.

81
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,083
Is there a balance?

82
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,416
From firefighters and hospitals
we expect higher numbers.

83
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,541
The terrorists in the Bataclan are not
who attacked the terraces.

84
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,791
Does that mean they're on the run?

85
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,666
Since we don't know how much
terrorists are on the run and...

86
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,083
others are still taking action
like Coulibaly did in January...

87
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,500
I suggest putting the city in lockdown
place until everything is safe again.

88
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,875
We mustn't panic.

89
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,166
This is not panic.
- A state of emergency is declared.

90
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,583
The first information is
just arrived.

91
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,375
A preliminary assessment of the
fire department in the 11th arrondissement.

92
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,666
There would certainly be 60 to 80
victims are in the Bataclan.

93
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:30,458
The number of victims is increasing. I know
not sure if it has anything to do with Athens.

94
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,208
Yes, I don't know.

95
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:37,208
I'll contact you but I'm coming
not go home while they are on the run.

96
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,883
Give the kids a kiss from me.
I have another phone.

97
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,750
At least, as you know
100 killed in Paris.

98
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,291
It's a massacre.

99
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,250
Doctors take care of the victims and
the fire brigade evacuates.

100
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,458
Our local colleagues secure the city.

101
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,666
We are prepared.

102
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,375
If it's too stressful emotionally,
can you get outside.

103
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,750
Who is one of the victims
thinks you know...

104
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,666
better go home or go
help on site.

105
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,833
There's no room for this
personal emotions, okay?

106
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,142
Marco's team is investigating under my direction
in coordination with Stéphanie's team...

107
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,625
that evaluates the process.

108
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,916
Sarah leads the security where
the research team asks for.

109
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,450
Julien and Mélanie lead the cyber team that
infiltrates and controls the networks.

110
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,958
Track all sympathizers
messages to IS on, okay?

111
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,166
The Margaux team takes care of it
for the victims.

112
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,083
Identification and hospital admissions.

113
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,375
In Paris, two or three
terrorists on the run.

114
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,166
It's 01:17. They disappeared
around 22:00 from the radar.

115
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,791
So they have an edge
of more than three hours.

116
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,175
We're investigating possible whereabouts
and shut down Paris and the suburbs.

117
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:13,166
All informants, undercover agents
and agents must work together.

118
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,083
Anyone who in the past 24
hours is caught, is arrested.

119
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,166
Everyone has to concentrate
on his job.

120
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,416
Like any other day. Okay?

121
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,041
Thank you.

122
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,476
We have the attackers' car
of the terraces in the picture.

123
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,333
A black seat.

124
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,541
That is him.

125
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,966
Here he drives up the Rue de Charonne and
he turns onto the Boulevard Voltaire.

126
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,291
One of them gets out.

127
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,750
So there are only two of them.
- Yes.

128
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,375
OK, and then?
- The car continues to move.

129
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,958
Here he is at Place de la Nation.

130
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,708
Guard. What?

131
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,375
OK, are you sure?
- This is where we lose them.

132
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,208
Next time we'll see them here
on the Rue d'Avron.

133
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,125
After the Rue d'Avron we are on their trail
completely lost.

134
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,541
Check all suburbs to the east.

135
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,250
Vincennes, Saint-Mande,
Montreuil and Bagnolet.

136
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:39,791
Boss, the forensic team has an ID
found in the car in front of the Bataclan.

137
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,208
Salah Abdeslam.
- A Frenchman?

138
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,250
No, a Belgian. Van Molenbeek.
A friend of Abaaoud.

139
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,000
The rest of the news is even worse.

140
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:52,125
He fled to Belgium with two others.

141
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,416
Salah Abdeslam, 26, born
in Brussels is on the run.

142
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,541
He rented the cars
the attacks were used.

143
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,208
The first was left behind
for the Bataclan.

144
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,375
The second, a black Seat, was used
to attack the bars with kalashnikovs.

145
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,583
The occupants are still on the run.

146
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:19,083
Salah Abdeslam became two this morning
men seen at the border with Belgium.

147
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,166
There is no evidence that Abdeslam
was in Syria.

148
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,541
According to the Belgian authorities
is he a childhood friend of Abaaoud.

149
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,809
He could have run the operation from
Belgium or Paris.

150
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,000
But under the supervision of Abaaoud.

151
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,500
Is Abaaoud really in Syria?
- That's almost certain.

152
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,833
From Athens he traveled via Bulgaria
to Raqqa.

153
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,875
We've had no trace since then.

154
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,375
The president speaks at 8:00 PM.
What does SDAT do?

155
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,416
All are working and
follow several directions.

156
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,375
So far there are 214
searches carried out.

157
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,208
There were 37 arrests.

158
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,583
Good. And the domestic
intelligence service?

159
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,750
We are interested in Omar
Alaoui. A drug dealer and...

160
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,500
classified as dangerous.
Radicalized in prison.

161
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,416
That is him.

162
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,416
Three new SIM cards in two weeks.

163
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,083
It has been since early October
three times in Belgium.

164
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,833
He has since escaped our surveillance.

165
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,250
I sent you Alaoui's file.
- I received it.

166
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,833
The DGSI sends its SIM number.
- Good.

167
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,875
Have him keep an eye on it.
- Right away.

168
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,166
Here, from the DGSI.
- What do you have on Omar Alaoui?

169
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,500
He could be involved
are with the terrorists.

170
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,750
We are looking for a black Seat.

171
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,041
An important watch request.
- Will be taken care of.

172
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,458
Djibril and Foued, you love
Watching Omar Alaoui.

173
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,500
Rue du Faubourg 35, Saint Denis.

174
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,416
Come on, grandma.
Come on, my little one.

175
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,208
There it is.

176
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,708
09:30. Alaoui gets out of a black Smart.

177
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:11,000
License plate Bravo, Mike, 547, India, Echo.

178
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,166
That is it. Well done, my friend.

179
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,833
I need the CCTV footage.
- Look at this.

180
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,541
Still no trace of the Seat?
- No.

181
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,416
Is he still in custody?
Okay, thank you.

182
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,791
It's so bad dude. Our brothers
go straight to paradise.

183
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,250
I had celebrated that here on the street.

184
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,291
Mashallah, but not on the phone.
Are you home tonight?

185
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,250
Yes, what can I do for you?

186
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,791
It's about the package I got you
gave three days ago.

187
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,166
But we are not discussing this
on the phone. It's too inconvenient.

188
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,333
Can I come over?
- Whenever you want, brother.

189
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,000
When?
- Like last time.

190
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,583
Then I'll see you later.

191
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,958
I overheard Benkhadra.

192
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,708
Tonight he meets a certain Mokrani.

193
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,291
Do we know Mokrani?
- Doesn't tell me anything.

194
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,458
Me neither.

195
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,125
Here's the SDAT. We need something
check on the Benkhadra case.

196
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm looking for a certain Mokrani.

197
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,791
Benkhadra is known but
we have nothing on Mokrani.

198
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,166
Benkhadra is a criminal.
- Mokrani interests me more.

199
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,750
Why?
- Nobody knows him.

200
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,291
That is interesting.

201
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:55,000
According to the cyber team, he's staying
aloof in Salafist circles.

202
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,083
Great, I'll let him in
keep an eye out. Thank you, Ines.

203
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,541
Thank you.

204
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:08,597
BRUSSELS

205
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,458
Police.

206
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,208
No movement.

207
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,083
Let go, asshole. Damn.

208
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,166
Stand still.

209
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,833
No movement. To the ground.

210
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,416
On the floor, damn it. Lie.

211
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,083
Abdeslam calls you and you go him
drop off 600 kilometers further at night.

212
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,625
And you think that's all normal?

213
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,291
I did not say that.

214
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,500
Salah is like a brother to me.
If he calls, I will always help him.

215
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:29,250
But you don't know where he is?
- No, for the tenth time.

216
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,125
I just had him at the train station
have to turn off.

217
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,750
That's enough. Didn't he tell you anything?
- Eventually, yes.

218
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,583
That he was involved in the attacks.

219
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:42,291
That this was just the beginning and
that it will continue to boom in Paris.

220
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,791
And that he has a bomb belt.

221
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,000
We thought he was lying.
- Did he say anything specific?

222
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,958
No, that's all he said.

223
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,416
What did he say?
- That he would blow everything up.

224
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,458
Okay, you know what we're going to do?
You remain in custody.

225
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,116
I have done nothing.
- In case of terror, even six days.

226
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,385
Danger of second attack.

227
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,766
I cooperated anyway.
- We're accusing you.

228
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,116
I have done nothing.

229
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,666
Wait, he stops. Wait a second.

230
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,291
He gets out.
Djibril, don't go right there.

231
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,166
He goes in.

232
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,958
He is inside. Djibril, go after him.

233
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,958
Can I help you?
- A package for Mr. Alaoui.

234
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,541
End of the corridor on the ground floor.
- Thank you.

235
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,500
Shift change in 30 minutes.

236
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,458
Start the transfer
to the new teams.

237
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,750
Any news about Mokrani?
- Surveillance starts tomorrow morning.

238
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,208
That is too late.
Benkhadra meets him today.

239
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,583
You already have so many pending cases.

240
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,875
We'll do it as soon as possible.

241
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,625
Yes, hello?
Okay, are you with the district attorney?

242
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,041
In the car were three Kalashnikovs,
six magazines, shells and magazines.

243
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:15,791
The fingerprints and DNA tests
are in progress.

244
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,458
The numbers are not archived.
The forensic team is checking them out.

245
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:28,000
Did anyone see you get out?
- No, we'll keep interrogating him.

246
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,041
Is that the Croix de Chavaux station?
- Yes.

247
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,250
Check the security cameras.
- It's up to us now.

248
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,791
Keep me informed.
- Yes.

249
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,666
Fred, Alaoui was tracked to Vitry.

250
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,583
I've asked the RAID to assist
at the arrest.

251
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,208
Police. Omar Aloui.

252
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:08,708
Omar Aloui. To the ground.

253
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,125
No movement.

254
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,541
Stand still.
- Police. No movement.

255
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,000
Stop, stand still.

256
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,958
Hands up. To the ground.

257
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:30,083
13 kilos of cocaine?
- Yes, that's why Alaoui went into hiding.

258
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,750
Has he nothing to do with the commandos?
- No.

259
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,583
Isn't the DGSI allowed to know that?
- What can I say?

260
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:40,666
Is there new about the Seat
in Montreuil and Abdeslam?

261
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,458
Nothing so far.

262
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,875
Yes?

263
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:49,875
We have strategically placed moles
in bars, mosques and prisons.

264
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,708
How are you?
- Boss?

265
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:55,041
The Railway Police has the
video of the subway station.

266
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,458
You see two suspects.
We'll have him in 30 minutes.

267
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,500
That's too long. Mark.

268
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:03,791
Tell the railway police we
need it within 15 minutes.

269
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,583
We've already said it here.
We are at war.

270
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,125
You also talk about war?
- We knew the danger.

271
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:15,416
Now it happened. Only one
few months after 'Charlie Hebdo'.

272
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,750
The government measures are not
enough to protect us.

273
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:23,416
It has been rumored for months
a number of attacks were thwarted.

274
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,383
If we are to believe the press,
they were poorly organized.

275
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,583
The security authorities have
not protect us from that.

276
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,875
Damn.

277
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:10,791
23:04. Benkhadra arrives at the
alleged residence of Tarek Mokrani.

278
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,458
You saw two armed men.

279
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:47,291
Is that correct?
- Yes.

280
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,750
One also said something, but
I don't remember what.

281
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,708
I know it's hard
but try to remember.

282
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,541
He turned to the other and said something.

283
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,708
You were dressed normally.
- He laughed.

284
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:07,125
He turned and laughed.
- Young.

285
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:10,500
I looked one of them in the eye.

286
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,208
It was as if he saw nothing.

287
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,708
He didn't look at anything.

288
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,916
The people they wanted to kill,
meant nothing to them.

289
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,291
Do you remember details of the clothes?

290
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,791
He was wearing a navy blue hoodie.
- Well done.

291
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,041
The same color as your jacket.

292
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,958
How old were they?

293
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,166
23

294
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,583
Was he one of the attackers?

295
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,750
No.

296
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,416
The only one I've seen
wanted to shoot me.

297
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,166
His gun jammed.

298
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,416
So he tried again.

299
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,625
It still didn't work.

300
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,208
I don't know why I'm still alive.

301
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,250
It's fine this way.

302
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,625
I was hiding behind a table and
only saw feet.

303
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,916
One of them wore orange sneakers.

304
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,500
Orange?
- Yes, a bright orange.

305
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,125
And then... just silence.

306
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,583
Yes, that's interesting.

307
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:13,541
I know honey but you would
also say something nice.

308
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,291
I would like that.

309
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:19,125
SDAT16 passes the presumptive
home of Tarek Mokrani.

310
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,291
It's 12:45. We draw up a protocol.

311
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:26,666
Exactly, Enghien-les-Bains, three days.
Just you and me.

312
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,416
The windows are fitted with curtains.

313
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,541
No suspicious movement inside.

314
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,875
Foued, something is moving. Get out of there.
- Exactly, three days.

315
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,708
We also see the movement.

316
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:41,125
One person, North African male,
beard and about 25 years old.

317
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,916
I confirm that.
- I can't hear you anymore.

318
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,958
Turn the camera back on. You are so Beautiful.

319
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,875
Ask for the Belgian number plate
after at EUCARIS.

320
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:53,083
Yes, I'm taking Diego home
and get to work.

321
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,083
Delattre.

322
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,791
Hey, wait. Delattre.

323
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,829
A group of loyal soldiers
of the caliphate...

324
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:21,333
has the capital of Europe where the flag
depends on the monstrous perversion...

325
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:24,433
called crusades, attacked.
Namely Paris.

326
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:28,391
May Allah grant power and victory.

327
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:31,433
Eight brothers have selected
locations in the French capital...

328
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,291
capital attacked with
bomb belts and assault rifles.

329
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:38,583
The Stade de France. The Bataclan, true
hundreds of renegades held a feast.

330
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:45,541
And other destinations in it
10th, 11th and 18th arrondissements.

331
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:49,083
At least the attacks came
200 crusaders killed.

332
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,000
France and supporters must know
that they remain the main target of IS.

333
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,916
This attack was just the beginning
of the storm and a warning.

334
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,833
ISIS is responsible for this
claimed before the attacks.

335
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,000
Do you know why I let you know that?

336
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,833
So you could hear the voice of your friends
hear again.

337
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,291
The prosecution will have enough evidence
that the weapons come from you.

338
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,583
You're going to stay here for years.
Not a few months.

339
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,958
I've been here for two months and
I do not understand...

340
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:20,041
I just want you to understand
who am I talking about.

341
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,875
I have no weapons on
those jerks delivered.

342
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:25,708
The serial numbers on the guns
of the terrorists agree...

343
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:28,041
with the weapons that were yours.

344
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:32,250
Your weapons were found in the
car of the gunman in Montreuil.

345
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,958
If you want this to remain unofficial,
do you have to give me more.

346
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:41,500
Otherwise, I'll write down everything you say.
So say it.

347
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,666
I'm sorry I have nothing to say.
I also have principles.

348
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,416
You have principles.

349
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,958
That includes arms deliveries
to Islamists?

350
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,583
Is that why you have that beautiful cross on your arm?

351
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,916
130 dead, do you realize that?

352
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,291
Mothers, fathers, young people.

353
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:13,083
Kids woke up yesterday
to hear...

354
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,083
that they would never see their parents again.

355
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,708
Do you have children?

356
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:22,166
Do you have children or not?
- Mind your own business.

357
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,750
Where are they?

358
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,750
With your ex? With your mother?

359
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:30,875
I can hand her over tomorrow
to the assistance.

360
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,083
I'll tell her where you are
was involved.

361
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,875
I didn't know who I was selling to.
- What?

362
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:42,833
A year ago...
- I do not hear you.

363
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:46,175
I was commissioned a year ago
to take weapons to a container.

364
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,166
They just said where the key was.
- Okay.

365
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,458
Let's pretend you like us
volunteered.

366
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,000
That will be the prosecutor
like to hear. Your contact?

367
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,208
I was told that
his name was Abu Omar.

368
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,291
Abu Omar. Is that him?
- No, I don't know him.

369
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,416
OK, what else?

370
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,916
What do I have to gain?

371
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
My patience but not for much longer.
Spread the word.

372
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:13,000
Two or three weeks later
I another assignment.

373
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,916
In the greater Paris area.
I don't know if it's related.

374
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,791
Everything is connected. What was his name?
- He didn't say that.

375
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,708
I met him at the fair.
- And?

376
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:29,416
I knew him from Fresnes Prison.
His name is Khalid Ben Ahmet.

377
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:35,375
I sold him the guns
because he's an unimportant fagot.

378
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:39,708
Those 130 deaths were not my weapons
only 50 years of worthless politics.

379
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,000
Is that all?
- No.

380
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:46,000
On Friday, the army consumed napalm
all suburbs must throw.

381
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,541
But you don't have the balls.
- That must be it.

382
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,833
Look closely at my crotch.
It stays where it is.

383
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:57,666
How come this
Ben Ahmet could go into hiding?

384
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,291
That's our fault. We loved him
in sight but lost him.

385
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,833
I know this is difficult.
- And not even a little bit.

386
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:07,166
We don't have enough agents
for the hundreds of threats.

387
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,875
But still enough for someone who
has an arsenal of weapons, right?

388
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,500
Let's not let the authorities
questioning.

389
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:17,583
Finding the fugitives
is now more important.

390
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,500
Why don't we know yet?
It's been three days.

391
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:24,500
Three days, damn it.
- My people have been awake since Friday.

392
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:27,166
We do too. What's your point?

393
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,750
Maybe you don't understand which one
responsibility we have.

394
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,875
Excuse me?
- We have to keep the citizens safe.

395
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:37,375
The minister expects results.
Find that Ben Ahmet.

396
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,875
Check all of Ben Ahmet's recordings
of the past six months.

397
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,208
Khalid, this is Mouss.

398
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,500
Where are you? I can never reach you.

399
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,666
Where is the detention file?

400
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,125
He was on the tape.

401
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:55,916
Call me back. I have a contact person
for instruments and guitars.

402
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,416
Hello, Khalid?

403
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:02,708
Radicalized in Turkey in 2013.
- We're looking for Khalid Ben Ahmet.

404
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:06,666
I need the report in ten minutes.
- The DGSI lost him.

405
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,166
And on the internet?
- Nothing.

406
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,666
Nothing but the confession of IS.

407
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,316
Brethren, who has a car for me?

408
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,791
Guard. Three weeks ago
he bought a Mercedes.

409
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,666
Brilliant. I am coming.
- Okay.

410
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:27,166
State the model and
the license plate of the car.

411
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,833
Send out a witness call
with his description.

412
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:34,375
And the car?
- The emergency services have the license plate.

413
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,833
The helpline?
- We're drowning in information.

414
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,166
Yesterday alone we had
more than 500 calls.

415
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,666
Police.

416
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,625
Tarek Mokrani, you are
arrested at 1:45 p.m.

417
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:18,833
For participating in a criminal
organization with a terrorist motive.

418
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:22,416
Do you want a doctor or a lawyer?
- I want to speak to your boss.

419
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:33,708
Well, as you know...
- Can we talk now?

420
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,791
I want to see Martin Bérieux.

421
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,583
Hello? I work for you.

422
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:44,000
Three years of undercover operations
ruined in one day.

423
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,916
I'm sorry.
- Oh yeah?

424
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Explain that to your people
so they don't mess it up too.

425
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,541
Not in this tone.
- Make sure your service is back in order.

426
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,458
Take it easy.

427
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:58,000
If I go to 20 people for you
send a coke dealer, I'll pull your...

428
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,125
secret service, no doubt.

429
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,208
What do you want to say?
- Do you want to hear more?

430
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,708
What do your undercover agents have
already discovered?

431
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,875
I knew nothing about the DGSI.

432
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,916
That's not the problem.

433
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,791
But the problem is that DGSI didn't clear
that we had found Mokrani.

434
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:18,708
There was no collaboration with
the surveillance and investigation team.

435
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,583
And of course no log.

436
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:24,375
I want to know where you
got the address from.

437
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:29,750
From an internal source.
- The truth, please.

438
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,833
I followed him.
- Who followed you?

439
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,666
Benkhadra.

440
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,583
I knew he was going to meet Mokrani
and followed him.

441
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:46,541
It was urgent. I knew
not that he worked for DGSI.

442
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:49,833
Please wait. You think
the problem lies with the DGSI?

443
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:53,041
No, it's about efficiency
of this device.

444
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,583
You ignored all rules and procedures.

445
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,416
Imagine arresting Abdeslam.

446
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:04,250
His lawyer would have heard
that there was no legal basis whatsoever.

447
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,708
Do you know what would have happened then?

448
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,791
Then he would walk free again.

449
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,875
Is it clear now?
- I felt it my duty.

450
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:17,125
Yes, but this is not Roubaix CID.

451
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,208
No more unauthorized research.
Is that understood?

452
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:25,000
What you considered your duty,
was the worst case scenario.

453
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,000
Same as we those men
would help escape.

454
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,208
I'm sorry.
- Justifiably.

455
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,875
This was the first and last time.

456
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:41,541
You can go. I want in two hours
an update on the calls.

457
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,666
Shit, damn it.

458
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,958
Everything fine?

459
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:41,833
How many testimonials
do we need to process?

460
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:44,791
It was already 1250 calls
since this morning.

461
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,416
Okay.

462
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:42,750
Good day, anti-terrorist unit.
- Good day.

463
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,541
How can I help you?

464
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,666
With more information about Khalid Ben Ahmet.

465
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:54,583
We know that Ben Ahmet this mosque
has visited.

466
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:58,666
Several sources point out
his involvement in the attacks.

467
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,625
Can you tell me something about him?

468
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,833
I wish I knew more.

469
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,375
Khalid was a good boy.

470
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:08,791
It closed down a few months ago
to brothers who had lost their way.

471
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,958
If I knew where he is
i would tell you.

472
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,333
But he hasn't been seen for weeks.

473
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,166
Help him, please.

474
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:55,833
Yes?

475
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,000
I wanted to call you back.

476
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,583
We have Abaaoud for sure.

477
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,125
The Ministry sent Mirages.

478
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:08,875
The French army conducted yesterday
airstrikes on Raqqa.

479
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,166
The IS stronghold in Syria.

480
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,791
Ten fighter-bombers dropped
20 bombs fall on...

481
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,416
weapons depots, training camps
and command posts.

482
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:20,291
It was the largest operation
for France since the…

483
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,000
September 27 attacks began.

484
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:26,458
The target was Abdelhamid Abaaoud. He would
behind Friday's attacks.

485
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:32,375
The jihadist made a name for himself in January then
his arrest in Athens failed.

486
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,666
If his death is confirmed,
Would that be a hard blow to ISIS?

487
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,125
The influence of Abaaoud at
the French jihadists was growing.

488
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,916
There was a possibility...

489
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:29,041
I did athletics.

490
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,750
The high jump came first...

491
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,583
followed by the long jump.

492
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,166
I'll call you back, honey.

493
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,833
Yes?
- The Ben Ahmet file.

494
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,333
Thank you.

495
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:43,166
It was Friday at 10:00 PM
flashed in Montargis.

496
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,291
He was not in Paris during
the attacks.

497
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:48,833
But he was looking on the 14th
to a shelter.

498
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:51,583
And since yesterday 23:00 his mobile has been switched off.

499
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,166
Good thank you.

500
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,916
I may have something.

501
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:10,625
A woman from Saint-Denis says
to see the terrorists.

502
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,375
Under the A86 at Aubervilliers.
Dressed like bums.

503
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,708
She talks about Abaaoud and Abdeslam.
And she's talking about neon orange sneakers.

504
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:23,916
So?
That's what a witness at the hospital said.

505
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,125
That did not leak to the press.

506
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:31,458
She says she is a cousin of Abaaoud
catches. One Hasna Aït Boulahcen.

507
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,250
Is that the explanation?
- Yes.

508
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,458
That's unlikely, right?

509
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,041
It's weird for the sake of it
those neon orange sneakers.

510
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,958
Let's Hasna Aït Boulahcen and the
check the witness's environment.

511
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,125
Hello?
- Am I talking to Samia Khelouf?

512
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,125
Yes.
- Inès Moreaux of the anti-terror unit.

513
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,291
You contacted us today.

514
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:05,375
Why are you only calling back now?
- There were more calls.

515
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,875
I know where the terrorists
hide.

516
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,833
Can you repeat that?

517
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,541
Madam?

518
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,500
I know where the two terrorists are.

519
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,000
Marco, can I talk to you for a minute?

520
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:35,291
Samia, 30 years old, resident
of Saint-Denis, unknown to us.

521
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,241
She harbors a cousin of Abaaoud
which is not in the files.

522
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:45,541
Samia says that the terrorists are located
hide under the A86 at Aubervilliers.

523
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:48,250
One is wearing jeans
and looks like a Roma.

524
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:51,791
The other has a beard and wears
a bomber jacket and orange sneakers.

525
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:56,791
The problem is that they are Abaaoud
and Abdeslam identified.

526
00:48:56,875 --> 00:49:00,083
Abdeslam is in Belgium and Abaaoud
died in the air raids.

527
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:03,250
I know that.
- Doesn't she just want some attention?

528
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:06,166
Only three witnesses knew
of the orange sneakers.

529
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,541
She needs to be heard.
- Good, okay.

530
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:11,458
Let them arrange a meeting.

531
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:17,333
This is BAC26. We follow a wanted black
Mercedes from a distance.

532
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,583
Number plate Bravo,
Charlie, 254, India, Uniform.

533
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,291
One person in the vehicle.
We are waiting for instructions.

534
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,875
After the shock is in France
held a minute's silence.

535
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:02,708
Commemoration in the cities
civilians the 130 victims...

536
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,416
Come here. Stand still.

537
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,416
Staying here.
- Police.

538
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
aside.
- Stand still.

539
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:13,875
Stop. Police.

540
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,375
Get lost. Get out of the car.

541
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,291
To get off.
- Let go of me.

542
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,166
Hands up.
- It is well.

543
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,458
Give me your hands.
- It is well.

544
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:32,791
Khalid ben Ahmet?
Is the name correct?

545
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:35,541
Or shall we call you Abu and something else?

546
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,500
Jackie Delattre, does that mean anything to you?

547
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:47,791
Does that mean nothing to you?

548
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,000
That is him.

549
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,541
They were in prison together.

550
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,708
They bought guns from him.

551
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,458
Where were you on the evening of November 13?

552
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,791
It struck like lightning.

553
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,666
Are you afraid?

554
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,833
I can see that you are scared.

555
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,833
Our brothers will you
kill all.

556
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:21,833
What do you know about the
attackers from the terraces?

557
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:25,083
All I can say
is that the hand that hits you...

558
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,041
not just a hand.

559
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:31,333
It is the hand of Allah
and his prophet Muhammad.

560
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,166
Allah bless him and give him peace.

561
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,333
And it's not over yet.
She will keep hitting.

562
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:43,250
The brothers who are still free will you,
kill your women and children.

563
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,875
Fred.
- Let him go.

564
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,833
It is well. Everything fine.

565
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:52,625
Stop that right now.

566
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,333
What's wrong with you?
Get yourself together.

567
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:58,541
Go home when you feel yourself
cannot control.

568
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:02,375
Get yourself together and think.
I need you.

569
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,708
And let that asshole talk.

570
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,458
Samia Khelouf?

571
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:22,208
Ines Moreaux. We spoke
on the phone yesterday.

572
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,875
Come with me.
Can I look in your bag?

573
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,041
Turn around. Arms aside.

574
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,833
Can you turn back?

575
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,541
I'm sorry, those are the rules.

576
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,375
We go straight ahead.

577
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,708
This way.

578
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:13,416
Your name is Samia Khelouf, born
on August 16, 1983 in Epinay-sur-Seine.

579
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,775
You are a French citizen and resident
at 45 Rue Paul Éluard in Saint-Denis.

580
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:22,750
Hasna Aït Boulahcen is already staying
with you for two months.

581
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,083
We listen.

582
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:30,833
Okay, it was around 9:30 or 10:00 PM.

583
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:35,583
We drove to the A86 interchange
at Aubervilliers.

584
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:38,833
Hasna called.

585
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:43,416
I don't know with whom
it was someone in Belgium.

586
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,250
How do you know it was someone in Belgium?

587
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,416
I saw the number.

588
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,791
She wanted to quit for her 14-year-old
nephew to bring.

589
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,500
He doesn't have an apartment
and lives on the street.

590
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,791
We were at the entrance to the camp.

591
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:09,000
He saw us right away.

592
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,791
He was wearing a black hoodie
and orange sneakers.

593
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:19,833
I couldn't resist asking
whether he had committed those attacks.

594
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:24,291
He looked me straight in the eye and said yes.

595
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,541
He attacked the terraces.

596
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:30,991
He said they have a police station or one
nursery in La Défense wanted to attack.

597
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,550
He told Hasna that she needed him
help to find an apartment.

598
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:45,583
Then we went back to the car.

599
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,775
She immediately started calling people to
to find him a place to sleep.

600
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:54,041
And then we drove home.
That's all.

601
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:04,625
What was in his car?
- Just his fingerprints.

602
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,250
No traces of explosives?
- Nothing.

603
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:10,750
We have the photos from his cell phone.
- Let me have a look.

604
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,625
Go back. Over there.

605
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,458
Further. That there.

606
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,166
Enlarge the building.

607
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,166
Even bigger.

608
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:32,708
We found out about you.

609
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:35,375
It's about a journey
five years ago.

610
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,291
Just fuck yourself, okay?
- Yes.

611
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,166
Fuck you.

612
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,041
Is that you in the picture?

613
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,791
Look ahead.

614
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:50,416
You see? The place was hard to
find but we suspect Isfahan.

615
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,375
I have the right to a private life.

616
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,166
Yes, that's very important.

617
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:59,833
Do we need your IS friends
tell me you were with the Iranians?

618
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,916
I was there with a friend.
I have the right to do that.

619
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,458
A Shiite? That is not good.

620
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,916
Gosh, bitch.
- Listen, asshole.

621
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,226
Tell me who did it and me
don't put it on facebook...

622
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,958
that you are dating a Shia woman.

623
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:17,208
For the wire with it. Forward.

624
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:18,916
Good, it's coming off.

625
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,875
I don't know those guys.

626
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:22,666
You bought weapons.

627
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,916
For my cell. I was not
in Paris on the 13th.

628
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,916
When I heard about the attacks,
I wanted to hide the weapons.

629
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,416
Where?
- In a forest in the countryside.

630
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,625
Where exactly?
- I don't remember exactly.

631
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,166
You talk shit.

632
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,541
It's true.
- Tell me the truth.

633
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:41,500
In the life of the Prophet Muhammad,
it's the truth.

634
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,458
Allah is my witness.

635
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,250
Through the life of the Prophet.

636
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,125
We're going to succeed.

637
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,583
it was him.
- Are you sure?

638
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:33,041
Yes, he lost weight and his face
came in but it's him.

639
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,958
Abaaoud?
- Yes, 100 percent sure.

640
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:38,625
I saw him under the A86.

641
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,916
Let's go back again.

642
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,750
Tell us why you went there.

643
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,625
What does it matter?
- What?

644
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:51,125
Abaaoud's cousin is staying
with you and three days...

645
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,625
after the attacks
you take her to her cousin?

646
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:58,416
Don't you find that strange?
- She said her cousin was 14.

647
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,291
Hasna is virtually homeless.

648
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,041
I didn't know she was lying and that
I would meet this psychopath.

649
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:11,000
I saw his eyes in the rearview mirror
when he said he shot people.

650
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:13,050
In the rearview mirror?
They were outside.

651
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:16,458
No, we were in it first
camp and then in my car.

652
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,958
In your car?
- What was he doing there?

653
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:22,125
Don't know. Maybe he was cold.
- Cold?

654
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:27,375
Do you think I'm lying?

655
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:30,166
Let's take it easy.
It's still unclear.

656
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:34,916
They met him outside and then went
three or four of them to the car.

657
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,750
Yes.
- Three or four?

658
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,166
Why four?
- The second terrorist.

659
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,166
He stayed with the junkies.

660
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,791
But you said it was Salah Abdeslam.

661
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,541
He has not left the camp.
- Eventually Yes.

662
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,583
Outside I caught a glimpse of him.

663
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:53,250
From the car?
- Outside.

664
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:56,041
Are you sure?
- I was in the car... No.

665
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,416
Wait, I was in the car
- In the car?

666
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,833
I was in the car and they were outside.

667
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:03,333
Then I saw her when Hasna...

668
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:07,625
Exactly, Hasna got out with her cousin.

669
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,708
They went to the camp and
the three of them talked.

670
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:15,000
But I didn't see her well.
They stood in the dark.

671
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:17,958
I didn't have time to look closely.
- Shame.

672
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:20,083
Do you think I like this?

673
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:24,708
Do you think I like this?
I don't know what you want.

674
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,291
Take it easy one more time, okay?

675
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,750
The man you identified as
Abdelhamid Abaaoud asked Hasna...

676
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,208
to find shelter, right?

677
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:36,166
Yes, she agreed and he said he
would later give her the money.

678
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:39,666
And did she find an apartment?
- I think so.

679
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:43,875
How does she find one so quickly
if she has no shelter of her own?

680
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:47,208
She called people.
- Which people?

681
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:50,000
She asked people in her family.

682
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,833
Which of her family?

683
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:55,625
Stop me like a criminal
to treat.

684
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:58,291
I have nothing to do with it.
- That is not certain yet.

685
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:03,083
Is this a joke?
- It is important that you are accurate.

686
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:06,475
We try to understand why one
IS leader as Abaaoud sleeps under the bridge.

687
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:13,158
And why he to no one else
then asks his cousin and friend for help.

688
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:25,041
Don't know.
- You don't know much.

689
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:42,958
I'm talking to Fred.

690
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:46,375
Take a discreet look around with your team
under the A86.

691
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:49,166
Inès, just check discreetly.
No more than that, okay?

692
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,958
16:01 At the point mentioned by the witness
building in the Rue des Bergeries.

693
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,375
Nothing to report.

694
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,125
Boss.

695
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,208
I hope it tastes well.
- Thank you.

696
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,000
Look at the license plate.

697
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:34,208
20:16 Enter a Belgian car
near Rue des Bergeries.

698
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:38,041
License plate: 9, Oscar,
Uniform, Yankee, 462.

699
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:40,250
We're going back to Levallois.

700
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:44,833
It's the ideal hideaway.
Isolated and dark.

701
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:48,458
A mix of homeless people, migrants and junkies.

702
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:50,916
A Belgian car came towards us.

703
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,333
The license plate has not yielded anything yet.

704
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,833
Marc, what do you think?

705
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,916
It's unlikely.

706
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:03,208
Samia had correct info but I can
cannot rule out the possibility that it is a trap.

707
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:11,333
It could be a false trail that
leads us away from the shooters.

708
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:14,625
We're exhausted, Fred.
We're at the end.

709
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,375
If she wants to deceive us,
we drive straight into a wall.

710
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:26,041
Ines, your verdict?

711
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,750
I believe her.
- Why?

712
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:37,083
I know many women like
Samia in the suburbs.

713
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:41,208
They often avoid problems.
But she risked a lot.

714
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,666
I think she's telling the truth.

715
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,583
Abaaoud is presumed dead.

716
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,833
His cousin has been living with her for weeks.

717
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:52,250
She says she spoke to him.

718
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:56,583
She mentions orange sneakers.
Abaaoud would plan further attacks.

719
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,458
What do we know about the witness?
- Nothing.

720
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:03,583
Nothing about her connection to
the Abaaoud family or the cousin.

721
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:07,250
Her file is thin.
- What do you think about it?

722
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,708
Don't ignore her statement.

723
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:15,833
But it's dangerous.
- We have no choice.

724
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:18,625
Let's intervene, Fred.
- Okay.

725
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:21,000
I'll inform the investigation team.

726
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:25,291
I'm contacting the people in Morocco
who keep an eye on Abaaoud's uncle.

727
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,750
Okay.

728
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,000
She's on her way.

729
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:01,125
Djibril, she's coming to you.

730
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:09,333
Foued, she's coming.
I'm watching her.

731
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:44,500
Hello.
- My colleagues are listening.

732
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:51,125
Is that your computer?
- No, this is mine.

733
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,958
Do you never use it?
- No.

734
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:56,250
Can I see your room?
- Yes of course.

735
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:59,625
Here it is. Don't mind the mess.

736
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:03,625
Don't touch anything. You do not want
that she knows we were here.

737
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:07,791
Why don't you arrest them under
the highway? We're wasting time.

738
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:09,750
That will happen.
- Good thank you.

739
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:11,708
Go downstairs. I'll do the rest.

740
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,000
It concerns a transfer from Belgium.

741
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:14,500
Yes, Heloise? I'm flying to Morocco.
Abaaoud's uncle was arrested.

742
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,416
He only talks to a representative
of the anti-terror unit.

743
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,208
I'll keep you informed. Bye.

744
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:46,708
Sophia, help me. It's crowded here.
- Go...

745
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,708
It is up to you. You take over.

746
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:16,500
Excuse me. Where is she?

747
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,916
Djib, do you see them?
- No.

748
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,500
It is well. I have her back.

749
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:41,541
No, she's not. Damn.

750
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:45,625
Cadre, Rudy, we lost her.
Maybe she will show up at your place.

751
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,875
Ines, come down.
Hasna is gone.

752
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:50,125
Understood. She is gone.
- What?

753
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,625
You lost Hasna?
Let's clean up quickly.

754
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,833
Do you need help?
- No, it works.

755
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,458
I'll put this away.
- Yes please.

756
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:05,250
Ines, do you hear me? Ines?

757
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,500
Everyone, we've been spotted. Quit the mission.

758
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,500
Damn.

759
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:17,291
Shit.

760
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:21,166
Ines, Hasna is here.
Come down now.

761
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,208
Ines, do you hear me?

762
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:25,791
Ines.
- That's not possible yet.

763
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:27,750
What are you going to do? What is he doing?

764
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:31,500
Framework goes to the building.
- No, let him come back.

765
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,333
He's not wearing his headphones.

766
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:36,666
Sorry, sister. One moment, please.

767
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,500
My friend Aziz Markoum lives
somewhere around here. Do you know him?

768
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,166
No.
- Hold on, please.

769
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,708
I have to pick up something for UNI.

770
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:48,125
Where was that?
- Inès, Kader stops Hasna.

771
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:50,541
Come down. Come on.
- I will.

772
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,250
We have to clean up.
- Go away you.

773
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,791
What do not you understand? Get lost.
- Give me a minute.

774
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:58,333
Fuck off. Keep hands to yourself.
- I know that. Excuse me.

775
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:01,416
Is that good?
- Yes, go now.

776
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,916
Come on, damn it.

777
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,041
Do not touch me.
- Sorry.

778
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,166
I don't have time for this.
- Calm down.

779
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,875
I don't know that man.

780
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,291
Okay Sarah, she's coming out.

781
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,750
Frame too.
- Guys...

782
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,291
Please, Commissioner.
- Thank you.

783
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:38,291
Good day, I am a commissioner
in the anti-terror unit of France.

784
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,416
Inès, the uncle confirms that Abaaoud
was in Belgium two weeks ago.

785
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,875
You called. We checked.

786
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,666
So it's under the A86.

787
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,875
We have Hasna's address
shelter needed.

788
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,791
Get in touch with Samia.

789
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:52,541
I am counting on you.
- Okay.

790
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:57,958
People gathered all over the world
to commemorate the victims.

791
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:01,358
Trafalgar Square in London sparkles
in the national colors of France.

792
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:40,541
If we intervene under the highway,
can they escape.

793
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:45,083
We don't know how many there are or if
they have reinforcements and weapons.

794
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:47,517
We'd have someone in camp
should get, but they should...

795
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:51,583
can be quickly exposed
and innocent people would die.

796
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:55,166
We cannot intervene and
we need the address.

797
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:58,958
I don't have the address.
Why don't you arrest Hasna?

798
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,208
If we arrest her,
we lose our advantage.

799
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,166
I know it's hard.

800
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,583
But you have to help us
and find out the address.

801
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:12,041
That's your job. I have here
not my business.

802
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,250
I know that.
- So?

803
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:16,000
We need you.
There is no other way.

804
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:18,458
Damn.
- You are very brave.

805
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:21,875
I know you can do this.
Finish it.

806
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:26,291
And Hasna? What are you doing with her?

807
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,458
We're not after her.

808
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,958
After that we will help you with everything
What you need.

809
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,000
We'll be there for you.

810
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:36,208
You going to help me?
- I promise.

811
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:38,333
Your name is nowhere to be found.

812
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:40,416
Give us the address and we will intervene.

813
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,708
After that it's a thing of the past for you.

814
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:46,083
Don't worry.
I swear to you, okay?

815
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,708
I swear. Believe me.

816
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:53,291
We are almost there.
- Damn.

817
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:01,625
I will try.

818
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:06,708
Nothing is certain, but I try
to find out the address.

819
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,333
Okay.

820
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,166
What is?

821
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,708
Nothing.

822
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:18,958
Is it because of me?

823
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:22,541
Samia?

824
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,291
We have reason to believe
that another attack is imminent.

825
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:32,625
Hasna Aït Boulahcen got a transfer
through Western Union.

826
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:35,750
A terrorist has received money
from Belgium.

827
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:39,666
According to the witness, he has
case one bomb belt with him.

828
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:43,000
He wants a police station or
attacking a nursery in La Défense.

829
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,833
I'll inform the president.

830
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:52,166
I drive her around 9pm or 10pm
to the apartment.

831
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,333
I have the money and I'll take a taxi.

832
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,458
Can't you go there alone?

833
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:58,666
He is my cousin.
- And then?

834
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,583
Why do you have to go there?

835
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:03,166
Why are you involved?
I do not understand that.

836
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:11,750
Give me the address and I'll pick you up.

837
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:14,125
You are annoying. Stop.
- At midnight.

838
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:17,833
What is that? Do you want to betray me?
- What are you talking about?

839
01:18:17,916 --> 01:18:21,791
You live with me. Do not forget that.
I share everything with you.

840
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:24,125
You meet the most dangerous guys
from France.

841
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:27,291
I want to help you and I trust you
and you doubt me?

842
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,916
Then go away if you doubt me.

843
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,333
Now don't cry.

844
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:38,875
I'm dying.
- No, you're not going to die.

845
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:41,208
You will have a nice life.

846
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,333
What do not you understand?

847
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:46,708
I will never have a nice life.
Don't you get that?

848
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,083
Stop that.
- It's useless.

849
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:52,375
Please stop. Believe me.
Stop. Relax.

850
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:55,958
I will save my cousin.

851
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:59,250
He will do whatever it takes.
He becomes a shahid.

852
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:00,791
And I'm going to paradise.

853
01:19:01,291 --> 01:19:04,666
Hasna, stop that. Stop.

854
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:08,541
Believe me. Only me.

855
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:14,000
Forgive me, my sister.
Forgive me please.

856
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,791
Hasna, stop that, please.

857
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:19,583
Stop.

858
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,666
You must not destroy your life.

859
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:29,500
If I want you to pick me up,
i will send you a message.

860
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,500
I'm sending you a message.

861
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,416
Mouss found the hideout.

862
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:37,583
Rue du Corbillon 8 in Saint Denis.

863
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:41,333
To everyone. Drive to 8 Rue du Corbillon
in Saint-Denis to explore.

864
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:43,375
SDAT95 continues to track Hasna.

865
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,375
Got it, let's go.

866
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,791
Everything is prepared.

867
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:10,291
This is the terrain. Snipers here.

868
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:13,041
Surveillance teams here, here and here.

869
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,666
And here mobile task forces.
- Okay.

870
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,916
A vehicle is approaching.

871
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:33,791
A BMW.
- He's going around the roundabout.

872
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,375
I don't know what he's doing.

873
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,833
Maybe there's a deal going on there.

874
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,208
They talk. I do not know
what's going on.

875
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:51,458
Can you identify someone?
- Negative.

876
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,041
He starts. He drives off.

877
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,916
Yes, he's leaving again.

878
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,875
SDAT52, a taxi is approaching.

879
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:23,875
License plate: Alpha, Delta, 219,
Delta, Oscar.

880
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:26,500
Cab.

881
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:29,041
We found her cell phone.
She's in the taxi.

882
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,458
He goes around the roundabout.

883
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:36,916
Looks like he has to wait.
He stopped.

884
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:42,583
I do not see anything. There are too many people.

885
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:51,291
I see two men in fur coats.
Bomb belt possible.

886
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:54,125
Shots possible.
- Access not authorized.

887
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,708
He's going to drive.

888
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,041
The taxi leaves.

889
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,416
Keep us informed.
Launch the drone.

890
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,791
To all units. The vehicle is located
located 700 meters from the destination.

891
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:33,525
We'll let her go in
in the apartment.

892
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,666
Heloise?
- Yes?

893
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,000
They're here.

894
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:36,416
The suspected terrorists are in it
apartment with Hasna Aït Boulahcen.

895
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,250
The task force is ready.

896
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,833
Good.

897
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,875
The president authorized the raid.

898
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:09,625
Laser 1 for Laser 2 and 3.
We need the element of surprise.

899
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:14,041
We don't know what's in the apartment
and whether the terrorists have explosives.

900
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,708
We are almost there.

901
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,666
To everyone. Shut off the street.

902
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,250
Locking ended.

903
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,791
Laser 2, go ahead.

904
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:51,625
Laser 3, in.

905
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:48,166
Police.
- The door didn't open.

906
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:52,083
Bring it on. Just come in.
In the name of Allah. Die with us.

907
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:09,416
The surprise effect is gone

908
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,833
We keep them at bay.
Explosion risk is too high.

909
01:29:12,916 --> 01:29:15,833
We keep them at bay with continuous fire.

910
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:51,791
Stop! Let me out
come, please.

911
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:54,666
I beg you.

912
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,375
Let me come out.
- Hands up.

913
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:01,500
I have done nothing.
- Palms open, fingers spread.

914
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:04,750
I have done nothing.
Let me come out, please.

915
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:07,750
I beg you.
- Where's your friend?

916
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:09,625
He's not my friend.
- Where is he?

917
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:11,125
He's not my friend.

918
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:14,875
Let me out.
- Show yourself.

919
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,541
Don't mention it.
- Show yourself.

920
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:56,500
Laser 5 for Laser 1. We're in
the apartment. Location secured.

921
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,125
There's nothing here. Everything is destroyed.

922
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:03,375
No visual contact with suspects.
Everything is in ruins.

923
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:05,833
Send Explosive Ordnance Disposal.

924
01:34:05,916 --> 01:34:09,208
End of the storming.
I repeat and confirm:

925
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:11,208
End of the storming.

926
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,250
Okay.

927
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:40,041
It is over.

928
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,958
I'm sorry.
- Get me out of here.

929
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,500
Get me out of here now.

930
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,916
I want to get out of here. Do you understand?

931
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:07,500
You lied to me.
Am I the criminal here?

932
01:35:07,583 --> 01:35:10,958
No.
- I help you and you lock me up?

933
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:13,708
Don't you want to say anything?
- I'll talk to you, I promise.

934
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:17,166
Stop your promises.
You don't even follow them.

935
01:35:22,625 --> 01:35:24,083
Damn.

936
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,666
Where is Hasna? Where is she?

937
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,333
Where is Hasna?

938
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:43,041
Is she safe?

939
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,208
She is dead.

940
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:51,875
I'm sorry.
- No...

941
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:54,375
Before she could get out
he blew himself up.

942
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,250
Her cousin killed her.

943
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:58,750
Are you sorry? Damn.

944
01:36:07,958 --> 01:36:09,458
I'm sorry Samia.

945
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:13,083
I'm sorry.

946
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:17,708
What will become of me now?

947
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:21,166
What will become of me?

948
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,250
I can't tell you now.
Don't know.

949
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,916
I don't know, but we'll...

950
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,458
I do not know anything. I did not think
that you would be arrested.

951
01:36:39,083 --> 01:36:40,583
Don't know.

952
01:36:46,083 --> 01:36:49,500
It's true they're not here
should be.

953
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:52,291
I gave her my word.
- I know that.

954
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,375
But that's the law.

955
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:57,208
We will arrange this. Your case is unique.

956
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:03,750
Star witnesses get a new identity
but there is nothing for ordinary people.

957
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,333
That's disgusting.

958
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:08,333
I understand how you feel.

959
01:37:08,416 --> 01:37:11,291
Nobody likes to break their word.
- Yes.

960
01:37:11,375 --> 01:37:14,666
It's disgusting.
- This is just unreal.

961
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:16,916
I promised her help.

962
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,583
You promised.
I gave her no choice.

963
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:24,291
I told her I'll be there later
would be for her.

964
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:27,083
We used her.
She helped us.

965
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,791
You can't just blame the law.

966
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:33,750
Tell yourself you're doing well
have done.

967
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:37,291
Ines, you should be proud of yourself.

968
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:43,458
No.

969
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:11,958
We have one in five days
unbelievable storm.

970
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:16,041
We paid a horrible
high price.

971
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:21,375
We will be the victims of
never forget this Friday.

972
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:27,875
November 13 has a favour
and one after.

973
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:33,875
Anyone who has the past few days
experienced, will be better prepared.

974
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:40,500
The battle we are fighting is
inexorable and unfair.

975
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,750
As for our fellow citizens,
the investigation is closed.

976
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:50,375
It's only just beginning for us.

977
01:39:05,152 --> 01:39:10,846
In the attacks of November 13, 2015
131 were killed and 494 injured.

978
01:39:10,847 --> 01:39:14,551
The investigation took five years.
Thousands of interrogations were conducted.

979
01:39:14,552 --> 01:39:18,156
The studies were in
4 continents and 25 countries.

980
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:23,954
Salah Abdeslam was born on March 18, 2016
arrested in Belgium.

981
01:39:23,955 --> 01:39:29,977
In France, 37 people were arrested.
In Belgium 27 and in Austria 5.

982
01:39:29,978 --> 01:39:32,770
Samia Khelhouf's case caused concern
for amendment of the law.

983
01:39:32,805 --> 01:39:36,105
From now on, the law will protect citizens
who helped fight terrorism.

984
01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:39,060
It's good to know the character
by Samia Khelouf is fictional.

985
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:42,282
Her character does not represent
the entire Islamic community.

986
01:39:42,316 --> 01:39:45,238
After a process that lasted 9 months
20 suspects were convicted...

987
01:39:45,327 --> 01:39:48,215
to punishments ranging between
2 years and life.

988
01:39:48,216 --> 01:39:51,437
Salah Abdeslam was sentenced to life without
the possibility of ever being released.
