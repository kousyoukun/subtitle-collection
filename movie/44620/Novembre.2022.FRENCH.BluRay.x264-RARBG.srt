ATHENS

5
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,376
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

6
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:23,627
Not too much.

7
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,585
What time were you up?

8
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,876
Eight.

9
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:29,251
- Want some?
- Yes, please.

10
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:06,751
Working long hours, you must be tired.

11
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,293
Be right back.

12
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:38,376
Wrong floor.

13
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:27,376
Situation secured.
Send up the Frenchman.

14
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,876
Abdelhamid Abaaoud.

15
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,834
Take a good look.

16
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,126
Ahmed?

17
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,626
Where is he?

18
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,918
You know him?

19
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,126
I know nothing about him.

20
00:04:58,293 --> 00:04:59,293
Where is he?

21
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,126
Maybe on the roof.

22
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:42,335
We lost him.

23
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:44,335
Nothing.

24
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,126
SDAT3, Athens.

25
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,709
0948 hours.

26
00:05:58,126 --> 00:06:00,377
Abaaoud exfiltration op terminated.

27
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,834
Failed.

28
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,834
<i>Ten months later</i>

29
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,126
Yes?

30
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:36,876
Yup?

31
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,293
<i>TN750 to all units,
gunfire in the 10th precinct.</i>

32
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,501
<i>I repeat, gunfire in the 10th precinct.</i>

33
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:10,751
Turn it around. Yes, Marco?

34
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,210
Two bombs at the game?

35
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,918
I know. Héloïse is with the PP.

36
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:15,501
Sit tight, call everyone in.

37
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:18,875
Gunfire in the 10th?
The streets. Give me street names.

38
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,209
Bichat, Fontaine au Roi.
So, 10th and 11th.

39
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,043
Two men in cars,
shooting into the crowd.

40
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,543
Hold the line. Casualties?

41
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,709
Heavy in Paris.

42
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,918
<i>TN81 for BAC10, on the scene.</i>

43
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,709
<i>- We need backup.
- Heavy weaponry. Request backup.</i>

44
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>It's a war zone! I repeat...</i>

45
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,126
<i>Assault rifle wounds. Rue de Charonne.</i>

46
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,334
<i>Send backup.</i>

47
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,043
Sub-Directorate Anti-Terrorism.

48
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,459
Don't worry, I'll send a team over.

49
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,334
Surveillance units,

50
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,751
initial briefing Room M.

51
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:08,501
Number of shooters unknown.
One group at the game, one in Paris.

52
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:10,751
Gunfire, Rue Bichat.
Fontaine au Roi, TBC.

53
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,793
And Rue de Charonne.

54
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,751
Séverine,
Stade de France with your unit!

55
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,001
Sébastien, 10th precinct!

56
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,835
Terrorists at Le Bataclan.
During a gig.

57
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:31,001
<i>In the face of terror,
France must stand strong.</i>

58
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:34,001
Hold on, Marco, they went from
sidewalk bars to Le Bataclan?

59
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:40,626
How many of them?

60
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
How many?

61
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,085
Casualties?

62
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:52,876
Call you back.

63
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,251
Fred, RAID and BRI units
are ready to go at Le Bataclan.

64
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:00,001
Any estimate on casualties?

65
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:01,501
No precise numbers.

66
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,418
At least 30 in Paris.
Too early to know at Le Bataclan.

67
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,127
Bring up ongoing targets.

68
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,835
Everyone's on their way.

69
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,751
<i>We have, at my request,</i>

70
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:13,251
<i>mobilized all available forces</i>

71
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:17,501
<i>to enable the neutralization
of the terrorists</i>

72
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:21,835
<i>and to secure every district
that may be affected.</i>

73
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:24,292
<i>I have further decided</i>

74
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,376
<i>to seal the nation's borders.</i>

75
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,292
Intervention canceled at Les Halles.
False alarm!

76
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,751
No, false alarm.

77
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,043
So, where we at?

78
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,001
Fontaine au Roi,
they're searching the basements.

79
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,209
<i>My dear compatriots,</i>

80
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,459
<i>my thoughts are with the victims.</i>

81
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:43,501
<i>There are so many of them,
and their families and the wounded.</i>

82
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:47,459
<i>Several dozen gunshots have been fired.
It's sheer horror.</i>

83
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:48,835
I need timings.

84
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:50,584
- Talk.
- Call you back.

85
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,501
Two groups, maybe three.

86
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,127
One at Stade de France,

87
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,002
the other in the 10th,
attacking Le Bataclan right now.

88
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,376
They left one guy here.

89
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,418
So Bichat to Nation,
then back to Le Bataclan?

90
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:03,418
We're checking the timing.

91
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:04,960
Coordinating emergency services?

92
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,085
One unit. Flooded with calls.

93
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:11,584
When the 197 number's up,
it'll be a fucking tsunami.

94
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,543
Assault on Bataclan is go!

95
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,043
<i>At this very moment, our security forces
have launched an assault</i>

96
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,835
<i>at a venue in Paris.</i>

97
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,418
<i>I have called for military reinforcements</i>

98
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:28,043
<i>to prevent further attacks.</i>

99
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,209
<i>My dear compatriots...</i>

100
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,918
At the Ministry, call you back.

101
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:32,793
<i>I ask you to maintain</i>

102
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,668
<i>complete confidence</i>

103
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:37,334
<i>in what we can do
with our security forces</i>

104
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,418
<i>to protect our nation
from terrorist attack.</i>

105
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,085
We have a casualty count?

106
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:45,418
Nothing reliable.
We're waiting on info from the hospitals.

107
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:48,126
We have confirmation, though,
that the Bataclan terrorists

108
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,668
are not those that attacked the bars.

109
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,501
- So some are on the loose?
- Exactly.

110
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:56,668
But seeing as we have no idea
how many are on the loose,

111
00:11:56,835 --> 00:12:00,085
nor if other cells are about to act,
like Coulibaly in January,

112
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:04,501
so I recommend a citywide lockdown
until the situation is under control.

113
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,876
We will not give in to panic.

114
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,626
It's not giving in to panic.

115
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,126
The President will declare
a state of emergency.

116
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:13,085
All services must be back up.

117
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,584
Info coming in.

118
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:17,710
Provisional casualty count
in the 11th precinct

119
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:21,751
suggests 60-80 dead in Le Bataclan.
At least.

120
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,418
The death toll keeps climbing.
Could be linked to Athens.

121
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,126
Most likely, I guess.

122
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:36,835
Sure, but I won't be home
while they're on the loose.

123
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,501
Give the kids my love. I'll call.

124
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,793
We have at least 100 dead in Paris.

125
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,293
It's a massacre.

126
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:07,293
Emergency services treat victims,
firefighters evacuate folks,

127
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,543
and law enforcement
is securing the city.

128
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,710
Naturally, we train for this,

129
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:16,042
but if the emotional burden is too much,
stand down.

130
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,376
You will not be judged.

131
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:22,751
If you know a victim or think you might,
go home or work in the field.

132
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,918
I don't want
personal emotions taking over.

133
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,084
Marco's group leads Investigation,
under my command,

134
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:34,668
with the group led by Stéphanie,
who supervises procedure.

135
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:38,918
Sarah will head up Surveillance,
working on orders from Investigation.

136
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,751
Cyber will be led by Julien and Mélanie.

137
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:44,251
Divide up Infiltration
and Network Monitoring.

138
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:47,960
Track and report
all messages of support for IS, okay?

139
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:50,168
Lastly, Margaux's group handles Victims.

140
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,918
Identification,
hospitalization locations...

141
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:57,710
Latest news is, two maybe three
terrorists on the loose in Paris.

142
00:13:58,126 --> 00:14:01,126
1:17 am. They dropped off the radar
at 10 last night.

143
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,001
They're 3 hours ahead of us.

144
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:06,668
We'll define areas where they may be.

145
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,001
And we lock down Paris and its suburbs.

146
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:13,168
I want informers, undercover operatives
and cops to be coordinated.

147
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:17,084
Any guy acting weird in the last 24 hours
must be in custody.

148
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,793
And I want us all focused on our jobs.

149
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:21,084
Like every day.

150
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:25,710
Thank you.

151
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:30,543
NOVEMBER

152
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,585
NOVEMBER 14

153
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,084
We found the shooters' car.
A black Seat.

154
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,626
That one there.

155
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:56,543
There...

156
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,668
they're leaving Rue de Charonne.

157
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,293
Then they turn onto Boulevard Voltaire.

158
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,376
One of them gets out.

159
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:06,501
So only two in the car now.

160
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,585
All right. And then?

161
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,460
The car sets off again.

162
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:13,418
We pick it up here, at Nation.

163
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:15,293
Hold on.

164
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,710
What?

165
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,752
We're sure of that?

166
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,293
Next time we pick it up is here.

167
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,334
On Rue d'Avron.

168
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:29,001
After Rue d'Avron, done,

169
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,168
we lose them.

170
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,543
All right, so eastern suburbs.

171
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,251
Check tapes in Vincennes,
Saint-Mandé, Montreuil and Bagnolet.

172
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:36,418
Sir...

173
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:39,752
The PTS found an ID card
in the car outside Le Bataclan.

174
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,293
Name of Salah Abdeslam.

175
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:43,959
- French?
- Belgian. From Molenbeek.

176
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:45,376
Associate of Abaaoud.

177
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,917
Yes, and you'll like this even less...

178
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:52,418
He made it back to Belgium last night
with two other men.

179
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,418
<i>Salah Abdeslam, 26, born in Brussels,
is currently on the run.</i>

180
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:02,501
<i>He rented in his own name
both cars used in last night's attacks.</i>

181
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:05,209
<i>One was found outside Le Bataclan.</i>

182
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:10,668
<i>The other, a black Seat, was used
by the two terrorists who attacked bars,</i>

183
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,084
<i>armed with Kalashnikovs,</i>

184
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,585
<i>and are also on the run.</i>

185
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:17,209
<i>Salah Abdeslam was seen this morning
at the Belgian border,</i>

186
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,168
<i>with two other men...</i>

187
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:22,209
There's no trace of Abdeslam
traveling to Syria.

188
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:26,626
Belgian Intelligence says
Abdeslam is a boyhood friend of Abaaoud,

189
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:30,668
so he could easily oversee operations
from Belgium or Paris

190
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,001
under orders from Abaaoud.

191
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,959
Is Abaaoud definitely in Syria?

192
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,501
Almost certainly.

193
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:38,876
After the Athens washout,
he got to Raqqah via Bulgaria.

194
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:40,959
We have no sign of him since.

195
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,959
Pres goes on TV at 8 tonight.

196
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:45,376
What's SDAT got for us?

197
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:48,418
All my units are on it,
following multiple leads,

198
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:53,209
We've racked up 214 searches,
37 people in custody.

199
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,250
Fine. And the DGSI?

200
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:59,667
We have something. Omar Alaoui,
trafficker, jailbird, on our watchlist,

201
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,959
radicalized in prison in the 2000s
by Djamel Bouzihad.

202
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,250
That's him.

203
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:12,084
Changed SIM card 3 times in 2 weeks,
3 trips to Belgium since October,

204
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,501
doing all he can to escape surveillance.

205
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:19,251
- <i>Sent you the file of one Omar Alaoui.
</i>- Got it.

206

208
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:29,168
- Kader, from DGSI.
- What you got on Alaoui?

209
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:31,043
He may be linked to the terrorists.

210

Looking for a black Seat
fleeing the scene.

211

- Sarah, an important Surv request.
- We're on it.

212
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,585
Djibril, Foued, a Surv op for you.

Okay, thanks.

Me neither.

243

SDAT here, to run a check,
after a wiretap in the Benkhadra file,

244

I'm looking for a guy named Mokrani.

245
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:41,876
Benkhadra's everywhere,
but nothing on Mokrani so far.

246
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,502
Benkhadra never gave up on crime.

247
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,251
I'm more on this Mokrani guy.

248
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,834
- How come?
- Nobody's ever heard of him.

249
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:50,543
Interesting.

250
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:54,834
I put Cyber on it.
He's with the Salafists but not really.

you jump in your car,

you drive 600 clicks in one night,

261

bring him home, and that's "normal"?

262
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,293
I didn't say it was normal.

263
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,502
Salah's like my brother.
He needs me, I'm there, period.

264
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,085
Period.
Now you've no idea where he is?

265
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:30,793
I told you
he got out by the station.

- Yeah, we get it.

- Sure.

268

We thought he was bullshitting...

272
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,001
He gave details?

273
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:49,959
No, that's all he said.

274
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,210
What did he say?

275

323
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,085
What can I say?

324
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:40,668
What about the Seat in Montreuil?
And Abdeslam?

325
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:41,835
Nothing for now.

326
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,960
Plants at all strategic locations.

327
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:49,876
Dive bars,
underground mosques, prisons...

328
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:50,835
Talk to me.

329
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,001
Sir...

330
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:55,835
BRF reports
cams at Croix-de-Chavaux show 2 suspects.

331
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,376
Tapes in 30 mins.

332
00:25:57,543 --> 00:25:59,501
30 minutes is too long. Marco...

333
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:03,793
Tell BRF to move their asses.
Get those tapes in under 15.

334
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,168
<i>I agree with other studio guests.
We are at war.</i>

335
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,751
<i>What does "war" mean here?</i>

336
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:12,418
<i>We knew it might happen
and it has happened,</i>

337
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,418
<i>only months
after the Charlie Hebdo attack,</i>

338
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:19,751
<i>The measures currently being taken
are not enough to protect us.</i>

339
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:23,376
<i>We are told that,
in recent months and even days,</i>

340
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:26,793
<i>we succeeded
in heading off various attacks.</i>

341
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,210
<i>From my reading of the press,</i>

342
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,626
<i>it was mainly due
to the bungling of the terrorists,</i>

343
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,668
<i>rather than the security services
actually protecting us.</i>

344
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:37,584
Fuck!

345
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:10,334
2304. Benkhadra arrives
at presumed residence of Tarek Mokrani.

346
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,376
NOVEMBER

347
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:32,002
NOVEMBER 15

348
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,793
You identified two armed men.

349
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,877
Correct?

350
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:51,793
He spoke at one point
but I don't remember what he said.

351
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,293
I know it's hard
but try to remember.

352
00:29:57,585 --> 00:30:00,459
He turned to the other guy,
he said something...

353
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:02,626
- They were dressed...
- One laughed.

354
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:03,793
Normally.

355
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:05,710
He turned to the other guy and laughed.

356
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:06,877
Young.

357
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,585
I briefly caught the eye of one of them.

358
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:13,002
It was like he saw nothing.

359
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,793
He saw nothing.

360
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:24,793
All those people they'd killed
were nothing.

361
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:29,793
Do you remember any other details?
Their clothing?

362
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,877
- His sweatshirt. A navy blue hoodie.
- Great.

363
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,126
Same color as your jacket.

364
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,751
How old are you?

365
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,001
23.

366
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,501
Was he one of the shooters?

367
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:58,835
No.

368
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:00,877
The only one I saw...

369
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,918
tried to shoot me.

370
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:07,793
His gun jammed.

371
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,543
So he tried again.

372
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:13,501
It jammed again.

373
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,168
I don't know why I'm still alive.

374
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,376
He kept firing.

375
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,501
I hid behind a table.

376
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:22,710
I only saw their feet.

377
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:25,501
One was wearing orange sneakers.

378
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:27,501
- Orange, you said?
- Yes.

379
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:28,710
Flashy orange.

380
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,793
After that...

381
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:33,543
Silence.

382
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:10,917
I know, baby.

383
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,626
Call me up to be sweet anytime.

384
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,293
For sure. I love it.

385
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,293
SDAT16 completes walk-by of house

386
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,209
believed to be Tarek Mokrani's.

387
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:22,293
<i>It is 1245. Write it up.</i>

388
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,209
Yup, Enghien-les-Bains, three days.

389
00:32:25,752 --> 00:32:26,752
You and me.

390
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,835
- <i>Happy?
</i>- Windows are curtained.

391
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,626
No suspicious movement inside.

392
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,001
Foued, curtain. Move!

393
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,876
- <i>Move it!
</i>- Three days there...

394
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,501
Note movement.

395
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:39,585
North African individual.

396
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,959
<i>- Bearded, mid-20s.
</i>- Description confirmed.

397
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,917
<i>You're breaking up.</i>

398
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,084
Stop moving.

399
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:46,959
Camera on. Shit, you're beautiful!

400
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:49,876
Run the Belgian plates through Eucaris.

401
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:02,752
Delattre!

402
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:04,418
Yeah, hold on!

403
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:05,585
Delattre!

404
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,876
<i>A group of combatants of the Caliphate,</i>

405
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:20,293
<i>may Allah give it power and victory,</i>

406
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,710
<i>targeted the capital
of abominations and perversion,</i>

407
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,293
<i>which carries the banner of the cross
in Europe. Paris!</i>

408
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,668
<i>Eight brothers</i>

409
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:31,460
<i>wearing explosive vests
and carrying automatic rifles</i>

410
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:35,251
<i>attacked selected targets
in the heart of the French capital.</i>

411
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:36,876
<i>Stade de France.</i>

412
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:41,251
<i>Le Bataclan, where hundreds of idolaters
celebrated perversity,</i>

413
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:45,543
<i>along with other targets
in the 10th, 11th and 18th districts.</i>

414
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:49,084
<i>These attacks killed
at least two hundred crusaders.</i>

415
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,293
<i>France and its disciples must learn</i>

416
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,917
<i>that they are the main targets
of Islamic State.</i>

417
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:58,459
<i>This attack heralds the storm.
It's a warning to...</i>

418
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:01,501
IS has claimed responsibility
for the attacks.

419
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,167
Know why I played it to you?

420
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,376
To hear your little buddies' voices.

421
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:12,293
When we prove you provided the weapons,
we'll inform the Prosecutor.

422
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,501
You'll go down for years, not months.

423
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:16,958
Two months here, and I don't get what...

424
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,752
It's not about what.

425
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:22,876
- It's about who.
- I never sold weapons to those fuckers.

426
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:25,709
Serial numbers on weapons
in the terrorists' car

427
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,126
match guns you had in your possession.

428
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:30,126
See? Those are yours.

429
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,335
Found in the shooters' car in Montreuil.

430
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:37,668
I was happy to chat off the record
but you better talk or else...

431
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,376
she'll take down all the shit you spout.

432
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,710
Go.

433
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:43,668
Sorry, I have nothing to say.

434
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,501
I have principles.

435
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,168
You have principles?

436
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:52,043
Gun-running to Islamist terrorists
is one of them?

437
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,376
That explains the pretty cross
on your forearm?

438
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,126
130 dead. You hear me?

439
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:07,001
Mothers, fathers, teens...

440
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,543
There are kids who woke up yesterday

441
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:15,376
to be told their parents were gone.

442
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:18,585
You got kids?

443
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,126
- Got kids or not?
- Like you give a shit.

444
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:23,585
Where are they?

445
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:25,709
With your ex?

446
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:26,876
Your mother?

447
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,918
Most likely, tomorrow,
they'll be taken into care.

448
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:33,168
Rely on me to tell them
what you did.

449
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:38,585
I didn't know my buyers.

450
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:39,876
Buyers for what?

451
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:41,210
A year ago, I got...

452
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:42,668
Can't hear you!

453
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:45,335
A year ago, I was contacted to...

454
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,792
deposit guns in a container in Charleroi

455
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,043
They just told me
where the keys were.

456
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:54,460
See? Let's pretend
you volunteered the info.

457
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,959
The Prosecutor will like that.
Your contact?

458
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:58,751
He went by Abu Omar.

459
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,376
- Him?
- No, don't know him.

460
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:03,959
What else?

461
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:05,418
What the hell else?

462
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:06,918
What do I get out of it?

463
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,043
My patience, but not for long. Talk.

464
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,043
2-3 weeks later,

465
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,043
I got a call for another delivery in...

466
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:16,918
Near Paris.
I've no idea if it's linked.

467
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,709
It's all linked. Name?

468
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,876
He didn't say.

469
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,585
But he was at the transaction.

470
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:23,959
And?

471
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,418
I knew him from Fresnes prison.

472
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,502
Way back. Khalid Ben Ahmet.

473
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:35,460
I sold to him 'cause he's a damn fairy
and I don't give one fuck.

474
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,293
- Right.
- 130 dead?

475
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,793
Don't blame my Kalashnikovs,
blame pussy politicians.

476
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:42,001
- You done?
- No, I'm not.

477
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,126
Friday night, send in the army.

478
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:47,502
Napalm all over the projects.
But you won't. Limpdicks!

479
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:48,876
Right, that's all.

480
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,585
My cross, take a look and leave it be.

481
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,959
This Ben Ahmet guy?

482
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:57,667
How come he slips the net so easily?

483
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:01,126
Our fault. We put a tail on him,
and lost him.

484
00:37:01,293 --> 00:37:02,335
Sensitive, I know.

485
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:03,834
Sensitive, yes.

486
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:07,168
You realize we can't assign
hundreds of agents to our watchlist?

487
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:11,876
Sure, but a guy on the watchlist
stockpiling weapons, get all over him.

488
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:14,543
Let's save procedural issues for later

489
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,584
and focus on neutralizing the fugitives,
as we are...

490
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:20,210
How come we have nothing 3 days in?

491
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,543
3 fucking days, if I may say so.

492
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:24,502
My guys haven't slept since Friday.

493
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,168
We haven't slept either.
And your point is?

494
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:30,584
Our responsibility to the nation,
which you may not grasp...

495
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,543
Sorry?

496
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,876
Is to ensure
every citizen feels safe.

497
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,043
The minister expects results.
Find Ben Ahmet!

498
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:42,210
Revisit the Ben Ahmet wiretaps,
see what you can turn up.

499
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:44,126
<i>Khalid, it's Mouss. Where you at?</i>

500
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:45,584
<i>You never pick up.</i>

501
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:47,751
The dude in custody, where's his file?

502
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,709
<i>The kid from Montargis
is coming in with us.</i>

503
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:52,168
He's on the watchlist!

504
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:55,126
<i>It's important.
I have a contact for the instruments.</i>

505
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:56,502
<i>Guitars and everything.</i>

506
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:59,460
<i>Khalid? No talking over the phone.</i>

507
00:37:59,626 --> 00:38:01,502
- Top priority.
- Radicalized, Turkey 2013.

508
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,709
Khalid Ben Ahmet?

509
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:05,085
I want that report in 10 minutes, tops.

510
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:06,667
DGSI lost him.

511
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:07,626
And Cyber?

512
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:10,168
Zip. Even in infiltrated Syrian accounts.

513
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:12,751
Nothing. Only the IS communiqué.

514
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,210
<i>URGENT
Brothers, I need a car. Anyone?</i>

515
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:19,377
Marco,

516
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,904
he bought a Mercedes 3 weeks ago.

517
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:21,959
On my way.

518
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,751
Put out the model and registration.

519
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:30,834
We issued an appeal for witnesses
with his description.

520
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:34,377
- And the car?
- Registration sent out to all units.

521
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,709
- Meshing?
- We're swamped with info.

522
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:39,126
Last night alone, over 500 calls.

523
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,542
Tarek Mokrani,

524
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:15,626
at 1345, you are now under arrest

525
00:39:15,793 --> 00:39:18,876
for conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.

526
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,709
You want a doctor or lawyer?

527
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,501
Better. I'll talk to your boss.

528
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,085
- As you know...
- Okay?

529
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:33,251
We can talk?

530
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:35,251
Get me Martin Bérieux.

531
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,584
Hello. I work for you guys.

532
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:44,001
3 years undercover!
1 day for you to screw it up.

533
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:45,918
- I know. I apologize.
- Apologize?

534
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:49,001
Tell it to your kids,
stop them ruining our hard work.

535
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:50,876
Martin, dial it down, please.

536
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,542
When your house is in order.

537
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:53,876
Calm down, all right?

538
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:58,001
When I put 20 guys
on the trail of a coke dealer,

539
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:01,168
do I bawl you out
about your service's incompetence?

540
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,417
Meaning?

541
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:06,709
Want more? Your undercover informers,
3 years for what information?

542
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:09,459
I'd no idea Mokrani worked for the DGSI.

543
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:14,252
No, the problem is, the DGSI had no idea
we'd tracked him down.

544
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,709
No C1 warrant, no Surv op,
no greenlight from Investigation.

545
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,210
And no paper trail!

546
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,459
Question is,
how did you get the address?

547
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,377
Info from an internal source.

548
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,793
Truth, please.

549
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,918
I tailed him.

550
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:36,834
Tailed who?

551
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:38,293
Benkhadra.

552
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:42,584
Surv couldn't cover his Mokrani meeting,
so I tailed him.

553
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:46,501
A state of emergency, a solid lead.
I'd no idea he's with DGSI...

554
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:49,168
You think the issue is the DGSI?

555
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:53,043
The issue is
our service's efficiency, Inès.

556
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,584
You ignored all official procedures.

557
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:59,501
Instead of Mokrani,
imagine you arrested Abdeslam.

558
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,210
If his lawyer finds out,
there's no judicial oversight,

559
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:04,376
know what happens?

560
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,918
Do you know what happens?

561
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,168
Most likely, he walks free.

562
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:14,376
I obeyed the call of duty.

563
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:16,709
You're not a provincial cop now.

564
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,293
We don't do undercover improv.
Get it?

565
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:25,085
Obeying "the call of duty"
is the worst thing you could do.

566
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:28,584
It gives those guys a possible out.

567
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:32,584
- Sorry, sir.
- Damn right.

568
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,501
It's the first time. And the last.

569
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:39,043
Back to work.

570
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,210
Report in 2 hours on 197 calls.

571
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,543
Fucking hell!

572
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:36,543
Okay?

573
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:39,292
Just fine.

574
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,709
How many statements to process?

575
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:44,876
We topped 1,250 calls this morning.

576
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,709
Khalid is linked to them, too?

577
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,835
The Belgian brothers?

578
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:11,334
Khalid, Malik's cousin?
Who used to come here?

579
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:12,668
Yes. Ben Ahmet.

580
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:15,251
Apparently, an emir in Syria called him.

581
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:32,876
<i>Khalid ben ahmet bagnolet mosque</i>

582
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:40,793
Hello, sir.

583
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,751
Sub-Directorate Anti-Terrorism.

584
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:44,543
What can I do for you?

585
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,751
I need information on Khalid Ben Ahmet.

586
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:53,960
We know he attended this mosque.

587
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:58,251
And multiple sources link him
to Friday night's attacks.

588
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,376
Tell me about him.

589
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,793
I wish I had information, sir.

590
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:05,085
Khalid was a good boy.

591
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,418
In recent months, he turned.

592
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:09,876
He joined brothers who'd gone astray.

593
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:12,668
If I knew where he was, I'd say.

594
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:15,418
But no one's seen him for weeks.

595
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:18,043
Help him, please.

596
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:58,543
I planned to call you.

597
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,418
We have a lock on Abaaoud.

598
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:05,793
The minister just called.
Mirages are on the way.

599
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,960
<i>French air raids on Raqqah,</i>

600

<i>the IS terrorists' stronghold in Syria.</i>

601

<i>Ten fighter-bombers
dropped twenty bombs,</i>

602
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:17,501
<i>targeting arms dumps,
training camps and command posts.</i>

603
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:20,376
<i>France has not conducted
such massive raids</i>

604
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:23,002
<i>since airstrikes started on September 27.</i>

605
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,501
<i>The target, Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud,</i>

606
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:29,085
<i>is suspected
of planning Friday's attacks from Syria.</i>

607
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:31,876
<i>The jihadist made the news in January,</i>

608
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:34,668
<i>when he narrowly escaped
arrest in Athens.</i>

609
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:38,626
<i>Abaaoud's death, if confirmed,
would be a major blow to IS,</i>

610
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:43,209
<i>since he was increasingly influential
among French-speaking jihadists.</i>

611
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:28,543
<i>I did track and field and...</i>

612
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,710
<i>One event we did was long jump.</i>

613
00:46:31,877 --> 00:46:32,918
<i>Then...</i>

614
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:34,585
<i>we threw...</i>

615
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,251
I'll call you back, honey.

616
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:38,960
The Ben Ahmet file.

617
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:40,167
Thanks.

618
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:43,209
Caught on speed camera
in Montargis, Friday at 10.

619
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:45,835
So he wasn't in Paris for the attacks.

620
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:48,835
On the 14th, though,
he actively sought a hideout.

621
00:46:49,002 --> 00:46:50,418
His phone stopped pinging

622
00:46:50,585 --> 00:46:51,585
at 11 last night.

623
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,877
Good, thanks.

624
00:47:05,209 --> 00:47:06,835
I might have something.

625
00:47:08,168 --> 00:47:11,042
A girl in Saint-Denis
says the two terrorists are laying low

626
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:13,334
under an interchange near Aubervilliers.

627
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:15,001
Dressed like hoboes.

628
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:20,501
Abaaoud and Abdeslam blah blah,
then a curious detail. Orange sneakers.

629
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:21,626
So?

630
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,793
A casualty mentioned orange sneakers
and it never leaked out in the press.

631
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:31,334
She says Abaaoud's cousin
is at her place. Hasna Aït Boulhacen.

632
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:34,626
The transcript?

633
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:39,334
Sounds pretty implausible.

634
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:41,668
The sneakers are weird, though.

635
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:46,042
See what we dig up on Boulhacen
and the witness's environment.

636
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:57,710
<i>- Evening. Is this Samia Kelhouf?
</i>- Yes.

637

<i>You called the hotline earlier?</i>

639
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,251
What took you so long?
I called multiple times.

640
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,710
I know where the terrorists are hiding.

641
00:48:07,877 --> 00:48:09,168
<i>Please repeat that, ma'am.</i>

642
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:15,251
I know where the two terrorists are.

643
00:48:18,168 --> 00:48:19,376
NOVEMBER

644
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:21,835
NOVEMBER 16

645
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:30,460
Marco, you got a minute?

646
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:34,959
Samia, 30, Saint-Denis resident,
no police record.

647
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,710
Has Abaaoud's distant cousin staying.
Not on our files.

648
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,293
Hasna Aït Boulhacen.

649
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,376
Samia claims that the two terrorists

650
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:45,543
are hiding under an A86 interchange
near Aubervilliers.

651
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:46,710
She saw them.

652
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:48,418
One, in jeans, like a Rom.

653
00:48:48,585 --> 00:48:51,710
The other, shaggy,
bomber jacket and orange sneakers.

654
00:48:51,877 --> 00:48:53,543
Trouble is, she identified two people.

655
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,793
Abaaoud for sure,
and Abdeslam at first before retracting.

656
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:00,168
Abdeslam's in Belgium
and Abaaoud was killed by an air strike.

657
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:03,251
- I know.
- Is she just making it about her?

658
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:06,168
3 witnesses cited the sneakers.
It never leaked.

659
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,001
She's worth listening to.

660
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:11,251
Bring her in and get her statement.

661
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:17,293
This is BAC26,
following a black Mercedes.

662
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,251
Vehicle flagged on file.
Discreetly shadowing.

663
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:21,543
Plates Bravo Charlie

664
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,626
<i>2-5-4 India Uniform. Single occupant.</i>

665
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:26,126
<i>Awaiting instructions.</i>

666
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:54,585
<i>First shock, then prayer.</i>

667
00:49:54,752 --> 00:49:55,876
<i>In a few moments,</i>

668
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:59,001
<i>France will come to a halt
for a minute's silence.</i>

669
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:02,752
<i>Citizens will pay tribute
to the 130 victims slain...</i>

670
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:04,126
Come here!

671
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:05,418
Freeze! Stop!

672
00:51:05,585 --> 00:51:07,418
- Come here!
- Police! Stop!

673
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:09,043
Move! Out the way!

674
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:10,293
Stop!

675
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,418
Stop! Police!

676
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:22,376
Get out of the car!

677
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,710
Get out!

678
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,043
Get off me!

679
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,335
Okay, I'm clean!

680
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,293
- Hands.
- Cool it.

681
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:31,460
Khalid Ben Ahmet,

682
00:51:32,376 --> 00:51:35,376
You confirm the name
or you go by Abu whatever?

683
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:41,084
Jackie Delattre? Ring a bell?

684
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:47,501
Don't know him?

685
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:51,376
This guy.

686
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,001
You were in prison together.

687
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:56,418
You bought guns from him.

688
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:02,543
Where were you on November 13?

689
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:05,709
They struck with lightning, right?

690
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:09,043
You're scared.

691
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:14,709
I can tell you're scared.

692
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:18,876
Brothers will slit your throats...

693
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,792
Tell us about the two men
who attacked the bars.

694
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:23,376
All I can tell you is,

695
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:25,126
the hand that strikes you

696
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:27,335
is not just any hand.

697
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:30,043
It's the hand of Allah

698
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:32,001
and of his prophet, Muhammad.

699
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:35,585
And it's not over.

700
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,418
They'll strike you again.

701
00:52:38,251 --> 00:52:40,543
My brothers at large will kill you all,

702
00:52:40,709 --> 00:52:43,335
one after the other.
You, your infidel wives and kids...

703
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:45,834
Fred!

704
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,918
Okay, okay. It's okay, guys.

705
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,460
Stop that right now!

706
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:54,084
What's gotten into you?

707
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:55,251
Get a grip!

708
00:52:55,418 --> 00:52:58,627
If you're gonna lose your cool,
you're no use. Go home!

709
00:52:59,084 --> 00:53:01,084
Pull yourself together. Think.

710
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:02,376
I need you.

711
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:04,709
Make that asshole talk somehow.

712
00:53:18,043 --> 00:53:19,210
Samia Kelhouf?

713
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:22,210
Capt. Moreau.
We spoke yesterday on the phone.

714
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:26,210
Follow me.
I'll take a look inside your bag.

715
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,709
Turn around, arms out wide.

716
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,460
Okay, turn back.

717
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,959
Sorry, standard procedure.

718
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:02,834
Straight on.

719
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,709
This way.

720
00:54:09,126 --> 00:54:12,376
You are Samia Kelhouf,
born 16th August, 1983,

721
00:54:12,543 --> 00:54:14,001
in Epinay-sur-Seine.

722
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,709
Nationality, French.

723
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:19,043
You live at 45, Rue Paul Eluard,
in Saint-Denis,

724
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,834
with Hasna Aït Boulhacen,
who has lived with you for 2 months.

725
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:24,793
Go ahead.

726
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:30,667
Okay, so it was 9:30-10 in the evening.

727
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:35,667
In the car, we reached Aubervilliers,
the roundabout under the A86,

728
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:38,126
and Hasna was on the phone.

729
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:41,126
I couldn't tell you who was calling

730
00:54:41,293 --> 00:54:43,377
but it was from Belgium.

731
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:45,751
How do you know
the caller was in Belgium?

732
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:52,502
I saw the number.

733
00:54:56,335 --> 00:55:00,502
She said she had to get out
to wait for her 14-year-old cousin,

734
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:03,918
who was homeless,
living on the streets.

735
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,793
We approached the camp entrance.

736
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:08,751
He spotted us right away.

737
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:11,834
He was wearing a black hoodie

738
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:14,001
and orange sneakers.

739
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:18,043
I couldn't help it. I was like,

740
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,001
"The attacks, that was you?"

741
00:55:21,335 --> 00:55:22,959
He looked me in the eye

742
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,751
and said, "Yes."

743
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,335
He said, "Yes, I did the bars."

744
00:55:27,668 --> 00:55:30,293
Then he said, "We'll keep going.

745
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,876
"We'll attack a police station
or kindergarten in La Défense."

746
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:37,751
He kept telling Hasna she should help.

747
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,335
He needed a place to stay and stuff...

748
00:55:41,793 --> 00:55:45,293
We left and went back to the car.

749
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:48,377
On the way, she called people up

750
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,293
to find him a place to sleep.

751
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:54,168
And then, we just drove home.

752
00:55:59,418 --> 00:56:00,542
That's it.

753
00:56:01,918 --> 00:56:03,793
The search of his car, anything?

754
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:05,043
Only his prints.

755
00:56:05,168 --> 00:56:07,335
- No traces of explosives?
- None.

756
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:10,834
- We're in his phone's photo galleries.
- Let's see.

757
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:18,085
Back up. There.

758
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:22,085
Keep going.

759
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:23,542
There.

760
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:24,834
Enlarge that building.

761
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:27,709
More.

762
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:32,043
Stuff came up on you, Ben Ahmet.

763
00:56:32,876 --> 00:56:34,751
A trip five years ago. Ring a bell?

764
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:38,043
Fuck you, okay.

765
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:40,126
Fuck you!

766
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:42,126
Is that you in the photo?

767
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:43,626
Look.

768
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:45,542
Look!

769
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
See that?

770
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:50,335
Took us a while
but we figure it's Isfahan.

771
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,377
And my right to a private life?

772
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,252
Sure, it's very important.

773
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:59,834
We'd be rude to tell your IS buddies
about your trip to see the Iranians.

774
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:02,918
Not the Iranians, a girl I know.
It's my right...

775
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:04,252
A Shiite?

776
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:06,459
Ouch, not a good look.

777
00:57:06,626 --> 00:57:07,793
Shut it, you whore!

778
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,626
Listen up, you prick.

779
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:13,834
Tell me who did it
and I won't post your Shiite on Facebook.

780
00:57:15,126 --> 00:57:16,126
Talk!

781
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:18,918
Good, let it out.

782
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:21,459
I don't know the guys you want.

783
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:22,668
And Delattre's hardware?

784
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:24,918
For my cell.
The 13th, I wasn't in Paris.

785
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:28,918
With the attacks, I knew I'd get heat,
so I stashed the weapons.

786
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,417
- Really? Where?
- A forest in the provinces.

787
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:33,626
- Where?
- I can find it on a map.

788
00:57:33,793 --> 00:57:35,168
You're bullshitting me.

789
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:36,126
It's true.

790
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,584
Tell me the truth. The truth!

791
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,085
By the prophet Muhammad,
I'm telling the truth!

792
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,876
As God is my witness.

793
00:57:45,626 --> 00:57:47,085
By the life of the prophet.

794
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,334
We'll get there.

795
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,584
That's him.

796
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:26,751
You're sure?

797
00:58:28,293 --> 00:58:29,293
Yes, that's him.

798
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:32,835
He's thinner, his face is gaunt,
but that's him.

799
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,334
Him? Abaaoud?

800
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:35,960
I'm 100% sure.

801
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:37,876
I saw him under the A86.

802
00:58:38,793 --> 00:58:41,210
I'd like to back this up, if I may.

803
00:58:41,626 --> 00:58:43,835
Can you tell us why you went there?

804
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:47,626
- What does that change, why I went?
- What does it change?

805
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:51,043
You take in Abaaoud's cousin,
and 3 days after the attacks,

806
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,459
she asks you to visit her cousin,
and you go.

807
00:58:53,626 --> 00:58:55,376
That doesn't seem strange to you?

808
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:58,793
She said
her cousin was 14 years old so...

809
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:01,376
Hasna's practically homeless.

810
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,459
I'd no idea she was lying.

811
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:05,751
That I'd run into a psychopath.

812
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,210
We made eye contact, in the rearview,

813
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:11,001
when he was saying
he'd opened fire on people...

814
00:59:11,168 --> 00:59:12,835
The rearview?
You said you met outside.

815
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:16,459
We met outside near the camp,
then got in my car.

816
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:18,835
- Your car?
- Why'd he get in your car?

817
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:19,793
I don't know.

818
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:22,210
- Maybe he was cold or didn't...
- Cold?

819
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:27,292
You seriously think I'm lying?

820
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:30,251
Walk us through it again.
It's not clear.

821
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:32,168
First you met outside,

822
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:34,501
and then all three of you...

823
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:36,168
Or four of you?

824
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:37,709
- Walked to your car.
- Yes.

825
00:59:37,876 --> 00:59:38,876
Three or four?

826
00:59:38,918 --> 00:59:41,168
- Four? Why four?
- The second terrorist.

827
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:43,793
He stayed with the junkies. Keep up!

828
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,835
We're trying.
You claim that person was Salah Abdeslam.

829
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,501
- And he never left the camp.
- Sure he did.

830
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:51,584
He came out, I glimpsed him...

831
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:53,251
- From the car or outside?
- Outside.

832
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:54,418
You're sure?

833
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:55,960
I was in the car, no...

834
00:59:56,127 --> 00:59:57,584
Hold on, I was in the car.

835
00:59:57,751 --> 00:59:59,251
- You were in the car?
- I was.

836
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:00,751
They were outside.

837
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:03,001
And I saw them when Hasna...

838
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:07,668
That's it, when Hasna got out of the car
with her cousin.

839
01:00:07,835 --> 01:00:10,710
I saw all three of them talking
outside the camp,

840
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:12,918
but I hardly saw them. It was dark.

841
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:17,459
- I didn't get time to see them.
- Too bad.

842
01:00:18,127 --> 01:00:20,168
You think I'm enjoying this?

843
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,543
Do you or not?

844
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,710
I don't get
where you're going with this.

845
01:00:24,876 --> 01:00:26,292
Let's take it from the top.

846
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:28,418
The man you say is Abdelhamid Abaaoud,

847
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:32,209
you heard him ask Hasna
to find him a place to lay low?

848
01:00:32,543 --> 01:00:36,168
Very clearly. A place to lay low
in return for money later.

849
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:38,459
You know if she's found him a place?

850
01:00:38,626 --> 01:00:40,251
She hasn't said but I guess.

851
01:00:40,418 --> 01:00:43,876
So easily?
You took her in because she had nowhere.

852
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:45,127
She called people.

853
01:00:45,543 --> 01:00:47,209
- Which people?
- I don't know.

854
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:50,002
I know she called people,
she asked her family...

855
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,835
Her family? Who in her family?

856
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:54,710
Please don't talk to me
as if I'm a criminal.

857
01:00:55,793 --> 01:00:57,209
I've done nothing wrong.

858
01:00:57,543 --> 01:00:58,543
Perhaps.

859
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:01,418
- Is this a joke?
- It's very important.

860
01:01:01,584 --> 01:01:03,668
You need to be as precise as possible.

861
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:08,626
To clarify why Abaaoud, an IS big wheel,
might be sleeping under an expressway.

862
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:11,418
And the only person he can call for help

863
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,334
is a loser cousin
and her do-gooder friend.

864
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,376
I don't know.

865
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:24,876
You don't know much.

866
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:42,835
I'll talk to Fred.

867
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:46,043
You and your team
discreetly check out the A86.

868
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:47,459
Inès.

869
01:01:47,543 --> 01:01:49,002
Discreetly, nothing more.

870
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:10,085
1601 hours.

871
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:13,043
Arrival at location given by witness.
Rue des Bergeries.

872
01:02:13,918 --> 01:02:15,126
Nothing to report.

873
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:16,501
Boss...

874
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,668
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

875
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:30,293
Look, the plates.

876
01:03:31,751 --> 01:03:34,251
2016 hours. Car with Belgian plates
on Rue des Bergeries.

877
01:03:34,418 --> 01:03:36,960
Registration 9 Oscar Uniform Yankee

878
01:03:37,126 --> 01:03:38,126
4-6-2.

879
01:03:38,168 --> 01:03:39,835
We're headed back to base.

880
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,209
An ideal hideout.

881
01:03:43,793 --> 01:03:44,918
Remote, sleazy.

882
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:47,877
A mix of homeless, migrants and junkies.

883
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:50,960
As we were leaving,
a car with Belgian tags arrived.

884
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:53,418
We're running checks. Nothing so far.

885
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,126
Marco, thoughts?

886
01:03:56,001 --> 01:03:58,001
It's fragile. Unlikely even.

887
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:03,209
Samia, the witness, gave us
some interesting info that checks out.

888
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:06,710
But I can't put aside the idea
it's a trap.

889
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:09,459
Maybe she was manipulated
to mislead us.

890
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,084
Away from the shooters.

891
01:04:12,626 --> 01:04:14,668
We're exhausted, Fred. Frazzled.

892
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:15,835
So...

893
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:20,501
For whatever reason, if she's lying,
manipulating or bullshitting us,

894
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:21,918
we're toast.

895
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:24,418
Inès?

896
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:26,543
Your gut feeling?

897
01:04:29,751 --> 01:04:30,751
I believe her.

898
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:31,918
Why?

899
01:04:34,084 --> 01:04:36,668
I met lots of Samias in the projects.

900
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:41,001
Usually, they duck these issues.
She took a huge risk coming here.

901
01:04:43,543 --> 01:04:45,460
I think she's telling the truth.

902
01:04:45,835 --> 01:04:47,585
But Abaaoud's presumed dead.

903
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:49,877
She took in
his distant cousin weeks ago,

904
01:04:50,042 --> 01:04:52,251
and claims she talked to him
at the hideout.

905
01:04:52,585 --> 01:04:54,751
She also mentions orange sneakers,

906
01:04:54,918 --> 01:04:56,585
and says Abaaoud plans another strike.

907
01:04:56,751 --> 01:04:58,543
- Any intel on the witness?
- None.

908
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:02,959
A big blank on the witness,
her links to Abaaoud and the cousin.

909
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:05,877
The slenderest of leads.

910
01:05:06,251 --> 01:05:07,543
What do you think?

911
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,543
I think we can't ignore this witness.

912
01:05:13,418 --> 01:05:15,793
- I also think it's dangerous.
- We have no choice.

913
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:17,668
We're going for it, Fred.

914
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:20,710
I'll put Investigation on it.

915
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,877
And I'll go see the Moroccans.

916
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:25,585
They have Abaaoud's uncle
under surveillance.

917
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:33,959
NOVEMBER

918
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:35,959
NOVEMBER 17

919
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:57,585
<i>Movement.</i>

920
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:00,752
<i>Djibril, headed your way.</i>

921
01:06:06,626 --> 01:06:09,126
Foued, to you.
Keeping eyes on her.

922
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:44,585
We'll wire up the apartment.
Won't take long.

923
01:06:48,209 --> 01:06:50,335
- She uses this computer?
- It's mine.

924
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:51,959
Yours? She never touches it?

925
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:53,876
- No.
- Show me her room?

926
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,585
<i>- Please.
- Yes, of course.</i>

927
01:06:56,418 --> 01:06:57,418
<i>There.</i>

928
01:06:57,959 --> 01:06:59,626
<i>Sorry, it's a mess.</i>

929
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:02,710
Don't touch a thing,
it tips her off we were here.

930
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:06,376
I don't get why you don't arrest them
under the expressway.

931
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:07,792
Why waste time?

932
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:09,668
- All done.
- Great, thanks.

933
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:11,418
I've got it from here.

934
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:22,542
For a transaction. From Belgium.

935
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:36,543
MOROCCO

936
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:10,667
Yes, Héloïse?

937
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:13,708
I'm flying to Morocco.
Abaaoud's uncle was arrested.

938
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:17,293
He says he'll only talk
to French anti-terrorism.

939
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:18,708
I'll keep you posted.

940
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:45,084
Sofia, get on it. It's busy.

941
01:09:46,084 --> 01:09:47,627
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

942
01:09:57,168 --> 01:09:58,626
Benoit, coming your way.

943
01:09:58,793 --> 01:10:00,001
<i>Take over, good job.</i>

944
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,210
Sorry, ma'am.

945
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:16,585
Where is she?

946
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:18,585
- <i> Djib, anything?
</i>- No sign of her.

947
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:22,834
Got her.

948
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:41,626
It's not her. Fuck it!

949
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:42,834
<i>Kader, Rudy...</i>

950
01:10:43,126 --> 01:10:45,584
<i>We've lost her.
Could be headed your way.</i>

951
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:47,876
Inès, get down here.
We've lost Hasna.

952
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:48,834
Copy.

953
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:50,126
- They lost her.
- What?

954
01:10:50,293 --> 01:10:51,335
<i>They lost Hasna.</i>

955
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:52,626
Shit.

956
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:53,918
<i>Can I help?</i>

957
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:55,502
<i>No, I've got it.</i>

958
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:58,667
- I'll clear these up.
- Please.

959
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:03,502
<i>You read me?</i>

960
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:04,709
<i>Inès?</i>

961
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:11,584
<i>All units, we're screwed.</i>

962
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:12,584
<i>Stop, stop!</i>

963
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:14,251
Fuck it!

964
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,918
Shit, shit, shit.

965
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,335
Inès, Hasna incoming. Get out now!

966
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:22,502
<i>You hear me?</i>

967
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:25,876
<i>I can't right away.</i>

968
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:27,751
What the fuck's he doing?

969
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:29,751
SDAT6 for SDAT28, Kader approaching.

970
01:11:30,251 --> 01:11:31,502
Tell him to back off.

971
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,335
Can't. He's without earbuds.

972
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:34,502
Excuse me!

973
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:36,667
Excuse me, sister, just a second.

974
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,502
My friend Aziz Melkoum lives here.

975
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,876
- But no mailbox. Know him?
- I don't.

976
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:42,251
Please, help me.

977
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:44,709
He has my assignment for college...

978
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:46,126
Where was that?

979
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:49,751
<i>Kader's accosted Hasna
in the lobby. Get out!</i>

980
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:52,085
- I'll finish up. Go!
- Gotta finish.

981
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:53,251
Get the hell out!

982
01:11:53,418 --> 01:11:55,793
Don't you get it?
No time. Beat it!

983
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:58,335
- I know, I'm sorry...
- Get lost, yo!

984
01:11:58,501 --> 01:11:59,584
- We good?
- Yeah.

985
01:12:00,085 --> 01:12:01,418
Go on, go.

986
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:03,001
Get the fuck out!

987
01:12:08,793 --> 01:12:10,043
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry!

988
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,460
I don't have time.

989
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:13,959
I don't know the guy. Piss off!

990
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:17,210
Sarah, we're good. Inès is out.

991
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:19,626
Kader too.

992
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:21,834
Jeez, guys.

993
01:12:31,126 --> 01:12:33,043
- Go ahead, commander.
- Thanks.

994
01:12:34,126 --> 01:12:35,126
Hello.

995
01:12:35,876 --> 01:12:38,377
I'm a commander
with France's SDAT.

996
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,335
Get out of here, you.

997
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:41,668
Shut it.

998
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:43,001
Why should he?

999
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,960
I want no Moroccans listening.

1000
01:12:45,126 --> 01:12:47,085
Talk to me and you'll be fine.

1001
01:12:47,668 --> 01:12:50,043
- I'll talk when I get guarantees.
- No.

1002
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,751
If you refuse to talk,

1003
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:53,793
I get back on the plane.

1004
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,335
My nephew is still alive.

1005
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:00,876
Convince me.

1006
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:02,918
I want residency.

1007
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:05,293
And immunity.

1008
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,293
I can't promise it.

1009
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:09,709
But if you want,

1010
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:13,210
I can help you move to France.

1011
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:17,501
Promise me
my nephew won't be killed.

1012
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,417
Your nephew likely died in Syria.

1013
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:23,459
No.

1014
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:30,960
Tell me everything.

1015
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:37,252
Inès?

1016
01:13:37,377 --> 01:13:40,542
The uncle confirms
Abaaoud was in Belgium two weeks ago.

1017
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:43,417
They spoke on the phone.
It checks out.

1018
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,542
Must be him under the A86.

1019
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:48,709
We need the address
of the crib Hasna's found.

1020
01:13:49,043 --> 01:13:50,793
Pick up contact with Samia.

1021
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,626
- I'm relying on you.
- <i>Copy</i>.

1022
01:13:53,126 --> 01:13:57,834
<i>Crowds all over the world pay tribute
to the victims of the Paris attacks.</i>

1023
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:00,459
<i>In London,
Trafalgar Square is packed...</i>

1024
01:14:14,168 --> 01:14:16,918
<i>Meet me in the garbage room.
Delete this message.</i>

1025
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:22,543
<i>Delete</i>

1026
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:38,543
If we go in under the expressway,

1027
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:40,459
it's 50-50 they get away.

1028
01:14:40,626 --> 01:14:44,751
We don't know how many are in there.
With backup? Heavy weapons?

1029
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:47,376
We'd need
to enter the camp to find out,

1030
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:50,085
but most likely
he'd blow himself up right away,

1031
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:51,668
claiming innocent lives.

1032
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:55,126
That's why
we need that address, Samia.

1033
01:14:55,293 --> 01:14:57,001
I don't have the address.

1034
01:14:57,168 --> 01:14:58,960
Arrest Hasna. She knows it.

1035
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:02,293
Arresting her shows we're onto them.
We lose our advantage.

1036
01:15:03,168 --> 01:15:05,210
I know it's hard,
all you're going through.

1037
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,626
Help us one more time.

1038
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,584
You must get that address.

1039
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:12,043
It's your job, not mine.
It's nothing to do with me.

1040
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,210
- I know.
- So?

1041
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:16,001
You need to see this through.
It's the only way.

1042
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:17,168
Fuck!

1043
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:20,126
You're very brave, you can do it.

1044
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:21,960
See this through.

1045
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:26,292
Hasna? What happens to Hasna?

1046
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:28,085
Relax, she's not our target.

1047
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:30,668
After, we can help any way you want.

1048
01:15:31,043 --> 01:15:32,417
We'll be there for you.

1049
01:15:34,085 --> 01:15:36,210
- You want to help me?
- I promise.

1050
01:15:36,376 --> 01:15:38,292
No names, no links to you.

1051
01:15:38,459 --> 01:15:40,417
Get me the address, we go in...

1052
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:42,543
and all this is history for you.

1053
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:44,918
Don't worry, I swear.

1054
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:48,459
I swear. Truly. Trust me.

1055
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:52,168
We're almost there.

1056
01:15:52,334 --> 01:15:53,334
Shit.

1057
01:16:00,168 --> 01:16:01,292
I'll try.

1058
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:04,334
I can't guarantee it, I'll try.

1059
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:06,376
I'll try to get the address.

1060
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:12,584
What's wrong?

1061
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:15,418
Nothing.

1062
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:18,668
Is it because of me?

1063
01:17:25,085 --> 01:17:28,376
We have reason to believe
another attack is imminent.

1064
01:17:28,751 --> 01:17:32,543
Evidence is a Western Union transfer
by Hasna Aït Boulhacen,

1065
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:35,710
supplying a terrorist
with money from Belgium.

1066
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:39,668
Witness indicates he's armed,
at least with an explosive vest,

1067
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:44,167
and in the coming hours, he'll strike
in La Défense, a police station,

1068
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:45,710
or a kindergarten.

1069
01:17:47,085 --> 01:17:48,543
I'll inform the Elysée.

1070
01:17:49,793 --> 01:17:52,085
<i>I'll take them
to the apartment at 9-10 pm.</i>

1071
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,751
<i>I have cash for a taxi now.</i>

1072
01:17:54,376 --> 01:17:56,584
<i>Can't they go alone? They need you?</i>

1073
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:58,668
<i>- He's my cousin.
- So he's your cousin!</i>

1074
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:01,960
Why do you have to go?
Why get mixed up in this?

1075
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:03,251
I don't get it, Hasna.

1076
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:12,376
Don't sleep over.
What's the address? I'll pick you up.

1077
01:18:12,543 --> 01:18:14,251
- You're acting weird.
- I'll pick you up.

1078
01:18:14,376 --> 01:18:16,918
What you blabbing about?
You gonna rat me out?

1079
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:20,376
Are you for real?
You live in my home, remember.

1080
01:18:20,543 --> 01:18:21,793
I share all I have,

1081
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,043
you take me
to France's most wanted men.

1082
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:27,293
I help and trust you,
and you doubt me?

1083
01:18:27,459 --> 01:18:29,960
Get out of my house if you doubt me.

1084
01:18:31,876 --> 01:18:33,126
Stop crying.

1085
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:36,584
I'm gonna die.

1086
01:18:37,043 --> 01:18:40,626
You're not gonna die. Trust me.
You'll have a beautiful life.

1087
01:18:40,793 --> 01:18:43,251
- You won't die...
- What is it you don't get?

1088
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,126
I'll never have a beautiful life.

1089
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:46,793
Don't you get it?

1090
01:18:48,002 --> 01:18:50,751
<i>- It's pointless.
- Stop, please. Trust me.</i>

1091
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,543
<i>Stop. Calm down.</i>

1092
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:54,334
<i>I'll save my cousin.</i>

1093
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,918
<i>I'll save my cousin.</i>

1094
01:18:56,084 --> 01:18:58,876
<i>He'll do what he has to do
and become a shahid.</i>

1095
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,876
<i>Inshallah, I'll go to paradise.</i>

1096
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:02,626
<i>Hasna, stop it.</i>

1097
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:04,751
<i>Stop talking like that.</i>

1098
01:19:05,251 --> 01:19:08,293
Show me some trust.
Just me, trust me.

1099
01:19:11,002 --> 01:19:12,251
Forgive me, sister.

1100
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:13,710
Please forgive me.

1101
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,793
Hasna, please stop.

1102
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,167
Stop it.

1103
01:19:20,376 --> 01:19:21,626
Stop it, come on.

1104
01:19:22,501 --> 01:19:24,126
You can't ruin your life.

1105
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:28,668
If I want you to pick me up,
I'll text you.

1106
01:19:29,585 --> 01:19:30,751
I'll text you.

1107
01:19:32,585 --> 01:19:34,084
Mouss found the crib.

1108
01:19:34,918 --> 01:19:36,334
<i>It's 8, Rue du Corbillon</i>

1109

<i>SDAT95,

1114
01:19:43,877 --> 01:19:45,459
Copy. We're on our way.

1115
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:06,460
We're good to go.

1116
01:22:07,959 --> 01:22:09,084
That's the site.

1117
01:22:09,334 --> 01:22:10,334
Sniper here.

1118
01:22:10,418 --> 01:22:13,001
Surveillance teams here, here and here.

1119
01:22:13,168 --> 01:22:14,626
Here, intervention units.

1120
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,001
Vehicle approaching.

1121
01:22:30,752 --> 01:22:33,876
<i>- BMW.
</i>- Going around the roundabout.

1122
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:41,460
What's he doing? There's soliciting.

1123
01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:43,168
<i>And dealing shit.</i>

<i>Yeah, some chatter.
Unclear what's going on.</i>

1125
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:49,917
Are you able to identify?

1126
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:51,543
<i>Negative.</i>

1127
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,626
There's movement.

1128
01:22:54,084 --> 01:22:55,084
They're dipping.

1129
01:22:55,543 --> 01:22:57,001
They're taking off.

1130
01:23:15,752 --> 01:23:17,876
SDAT52, taxi approaching.

1131

<i>Registration Alpha Delta 2-1-9.</i>

<i>Delta Oscar. Over.</i>

1133
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:29,126
<i>Her phone's pinged.
It's her in the cab.</i>

1134
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:31,917
<i>Going around the roundabout.</i>

1135
01:23:33,293 --> 01:23:34,668
<i>Looks like it's stopping.</i>

1136

<i>Taxi has stopped.</i>

1137
01:23:39,626 --> 01:23:41,460
Can't see. Too many people.

1138

No sightline.

1139
01:23:46,876 --> 01:23:49,460
Eyes on two men,
wearing down jackets.

1140
01:23:49,627 --> 01:23:51,293
Possible explosive vests.

1141

<i>Clear line of fire.</i>

1142

No intervention authorized.

1143
01:24:00,876 --> 01:24:01,959
Movement.

1144
01:24:03,084 --> 01:24:04,460
Taxi headed off.

1145
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:05,792
Taxi headed off.

1146
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:09,501
Let's go. Drone launch authorized.

1147
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:30,876
To all units,
vehicle is 700 meters from site.

1148
01:24:31,418 --> 01:24:33,209
Let them enter the apartment.

1149
01:25:28,918 --> 01:25:29,918
Héloïse?

1150
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:31,751
They're in.

1151
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,668
The two presumed terrorists

1152
01:25:33,834 --> 01:25:36,585
entered the apartment,
accompanied by Hasna Aït Boulhacen.

1153
01:25:36,751 --> 01:25:38,251
Units are in place.

1154
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:39,418
Fine.

1155
01:25:41,876 --> 01:25:43,959
We have the President's go
for intervention.

1156
01:25:44,126 --> 01:25:45,418

<i>Explosive load

<i>Arrival imminent.
I repeat, arrival imminent.</i>

1163
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:31,751
All units, lockdown requested.

1164
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:42,335
<i>Lockdown completed.</i>

1165

Fuck, door intact. Back up!

Come on in!

1170

In the name of Allah, come die with us!

1171
01:29:07,918 --> 01:29:11,085
Element of surprise gone.
Don't let them get near!

1172
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:12,834
Risk of explosion acute.

1173

<i>Saturation fire

1174

Stop!

01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,876
Let me out, please!

1176
01:30:52,793 --> 01:30:54,751
Please, I'm begging you.

1177
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:56,543
Let me out!

1178
01:30:56,709 --> 01:30:58,376
Hands up! Both hands up!

1179
01:30:58,543 --> 01:30:59,834
I've done nothing wrong.

1180
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:01,501
Palms visible, fingers spread.

1181
01:31:01,668 --> 01:31:04,751
I've done nothing wrong.
Let me out, sir!

1182
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:06,252
I'm begging you.

1183
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:07,709
Where's your boyfriend?

1184
01:31:07,876 --> 01:31:09,001
He's not my boyfriend!

1185
01:31:09,168 --> 01:31:11,210
- Where is he?
- He's not my boyfriend!

1186
01:31:11,626 --> 01:31:13,043
Let me out!

1187
01:31:13,793 --> 01:31:14,876
Show yourself.

1188
01:31:15,043 --> 01:31:16,043
Please!

1189
01:33:52,584 --> 01:33:56,584
Laser 1 for Laser 5, we're inside.
Situation stable and secured.

1190
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,209
Nothing left, total destruction.

1191

<i>No visual contact with hostile elements,

01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:56,543
Sorry...

1197
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,960
Get me out of here.

1198
01:34:58,126 --> 01:34:59,584
Get me out now!

1199
01:35:00,251 --> 01:35:01,626
I want to get out.

1200
01:35:01,793 --> 01:35:03,085
Do you understand?

1201
01:35:04,376 --> 01:35:06,209
You lied.
I'm arrested like a criminal.

1202
01:35:06,376 --> 01:35:07,501
Am I the criminal?

1203
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:08,668
No.

1204
01:35:09,002 --> 01:35:11,960
I give information, get arrested,
and you say nothing?

1205
01:35:12,293 --> 01:35:13,710
I'll talk to them, I promise.

1206
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:17,251
Quit promising everything and nothing.
You never keep your promises!

1207
01:35:22,668 --> 01:35:23,668
Fuck!

1208
01:35:30,293 --> 01:35:31,459
Where's Hasna?

1209
01:35:32,334 --> 01:35:33,626
Where's Hasna?

1210
01:35:41,043 --> 01:35:42,334
Is she safe?

1211
01:35:46,918 --> 01:35:48,126
She's dead.

1212
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:50,084
I'm sorry.

1213
01:35:52,084 --> 01:35:54,418
We tried to let her out
but they detonated first.

1214
01:35:54,585 --> 01:35:56,043
Her cousin killed her.

1215
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,710
Fucking sorry!

1216
01:36:08,084 --> 01:36:09,334
I'm sorry, Samia.

1217
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,668
What happens to me?

1218
01:36:19,334 --> 01:36:20,835
Me? What happens now?

1219
01:36:22,126 --> 01:36:24,835
I can't say right now, I don't know.

1220
01:36:26,585 --> 01:36:28,459
I don't know but we'll...

1221
01:36:30,126 --> 01:36:33,251
I have no answer.
I didn't expect them to arrest you.

1222
01:36:39,167 --> 01:36:40,251
I don't know.

1223
01:36:46,126 --> 01:36:47,960
I agree. She shouldn't be there.

1224
01:36:48,126 --> 01:36:50,877
- Witness protection...
- I gave her my word.

1225
01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:54,293
I know you did but it's the law.
I can't change it.

1226
01:36:54,459 --> 01:36:57,293
We'll try our best.
Her case is unique, a first.

1227
01:36:58,668 --> 01:37:02,084
Informers are given a new identity
through a program,

1228
01:37:02,251 --> 01:37:03,877
but regular citizens, zip.

1229
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:05,334
It's outrageous.

1230
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,251
What you're feeling is only natural.

1231
01:37:08,418 --> 01:37:10,376
Going back on your word is unfair.

1232
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:12,626
It's despicable.

1233
01:37:13,001 --> 01:37:14,668
Seriously, there's no way.

1234
01:37:14,835 --> 01:37:17,001
- I promised I'd help her.
- Yes but...

1235
01:37:17,168 --> 01:37:19,918
- You said, go all-in on her.
- I know.

1236
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:21,084
I kept on her.

1237
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:24,042
I told her,
we'll help and be there for you.

1238
01:37:24,459 --> 01:37:26,710
We used her. She really helped us.

1239
01:37:28,376 --> 01:37:30,042
We can't just say it's the law.

1240
01:37:30,209 --> 01:37:33,835
- That's irrelevant.
- Inès, you did a remarkable job.

1241
01:37:39,251 --> 01:37:40,793
You can be proud of yourself.

1242
01:37:42,585 --> 01:37:43,585
No.

1243
01:38:08,293 --> 01:38:10,668
In five days, we've been through a storm

1244
01:38:11,001 --> 01:38:12,376
no one could imagine.

1245
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,334
With a terrible price to pay.

1246
01:38:17,835 --> 01:38:19,460
We'll never forget the...

1247
01:38:19,959 --> 01:38:21,668
The victims of that Friday.

1248
01:38:24,752 --> 01:38:27,460
There'll be a before
and after 13th November.

1249
01:38:30,543 --> 01:38:33,376
After these five days,
we'll be better armed...

1250
01:38:36,209 --> 01:38:38,501
The battle we are waging
is remorseless.

1251
01:38:39,668 --> 01:38:40,752
Unscrupulous.

1252
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:46,209
For our compatriots,
this investigation is over.

1253
01:38:48,209 --> 01:38:50,126
