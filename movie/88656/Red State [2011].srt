1
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,578
What are you gonna do this weekend?

2
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:42,776
- I don't know. What are you doing?
- It's none of your business.

3
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:44,877
Did you finish that thing
for your Lit class?

4
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:48,014
No. It's due in like two weeks
or something.

5
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,284
Oh, sweet Jesus in the morning.

6
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:56,555
Again with these people?

7
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,838
He's burnin' in hell!

8
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:28,128
Because, if what the framers
of our constitution mean...

9
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:34,295
What, Travis? Fifteen minutes?

10
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:36,702
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

11
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:38,706
Where you been?

12
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,106
I was dropping my grandma off
at the airport...

13
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:45,170
and on the way back the Five-Pointers
blocked up Lennox Hill.

14
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:47,806
Oh, so Abin Cooper's after you too now?

15
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,215
Yeah, and I ain't even gay.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,720
Nah, you're not gay. You're just curious.

17
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,847
If anybody would know,
it would be Jarod.

18
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,425
What?

19
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:57,993
All right, all right, all right.

20
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:02,929
So every once in a while
we add amendments to the Constitution...

21
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:07,696
to expand, or more importantly, define,
the parameters of our rights.

22
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:09,271
Like the First Amendment...

23
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:12,899
which Abin Cooper practiced this morning
on Lennox, making Travis late.

24
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,806
Those people are such assholes.

25
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:18,403
Okay. I'm gonna let that ride
because this is a passionate issue...

26
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,813
and because, yes, they are assholes.

27
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,949
Wait. Who's Abin Cooper?

28
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:26,487
He's that creepy church guy...

29
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,319
that's always saying
how God's all pissed off at everybody.

30
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,892
Yeah, him and his family are the ones...

31
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:33,258
that are always holding up signs
outside of funerals and stuff.

32
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:35,490
This was they were
protesting the funeral...

33
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,725
of the gay kid who
got killed two weeks ago.

34
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,301
Yeah. Jacob Harlow.

35
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:41,370
He went here.
I didn't teach him, but he went here.

36
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,938
It was all over the news, right?

37
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,098
Jessie, I am both happy and sad...

38
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,268
that you don't know
who Abin Cooper is...

39
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:50,243
but, I mean, come on.

40
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:51,938
Abin Cooper
and the Five Points Trinity Church...

41
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,913
they're like right in our own backyard.

42
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,713
Come on, Mrs. Vasquez,
Cooper's Dell is like 30 minutes away.

43
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,753
Yeah. Too close.

44
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:01,688
Abin Cooper holds
our entire state up for ridicule.

45
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,453
All right?
Ultraconservatives avoid this guy.

46
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:10,124
Did you know last year the head of the
largest neo-Nazi faction in this country...

47
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,929
issued a statement
distancing his politics...

48
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:15,971
from Cooper's and Five Points'?

49
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,041
Even the Nazis think this guy
is "nuckin' futs."

50
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:24,306
All right, let's just hope that the Cooper
clan sticks with the First Amendment...

51
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:27,941
- Why?
- And stays away from the Second Amendment.

52
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:32,214
- What is the Second Amendment?
- We get guns.

53
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:39,421
What is this, man?

54
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,327
It's like Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

55
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,923
I thought Craigslist was Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

56
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:47,559
What kinda dirty shit you lookin' at, boy?

57
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,131
Fuck, faggot!

58
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,938
Touch my dick again and see what happens.

59
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,143
- Such an animal.
- They're all the same, man.

60
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:01,513
- You can't see any faces.
- Oh, shit. You showin' him?

61
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,813
Dude, get your fuckin' flappers
outta here.

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,751
Yeah, look, it doesn't matter.
You can see the tits.

63
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,789
You can see the fuckin' pussy, man.
Fuck the faces.

64
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,654
How we know we wanna fuck the face
unless we can see what they look like?

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,490
- Right, thank you.
- You fuckin' bag their head, man. All right?

66
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,257
Look, these bitches wanna fuck.

67
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,560
Even if they do wanna fuck,
they're all in New York and LA.

68
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,134
Lots more in LA Look...

69
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,203
New York. LA.

70
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,635
- Road trip.
- LA.

71
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,707
- LA...
- I get the point, all right, but look.

72
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,434
This one's a little closer to home.

73
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:31,111
Holy shit! Cooper's Dell?

74
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:32,442
- Let me see.
- No fuckin' way!

75
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,209
We're gettin' laid, boys.

76
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,308
How do we know she's gonna fuck us,
or even one of us?

77
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,512
I've been talking back and forth with one
for two weeks now.

78
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,213
She says she's interested.

79
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,790
Fuckin'...

80
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:43,791
I just got a little hard.

81
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,453
I don't wanna fuckin' fuck
some chick that he just stuck his dick in.

82
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:49,156
- Look, look...
- His greasy-assed fuckin' dick.

83
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:50,732
It's not greasy.

84
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,028
There ain't gonna be no sloppy seconds,
boy, okay?

85
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:57,197
She wants to fuck
all three of us at the same time.

86
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,671
- Jesus Christ.
- I call the ass.

87
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:02,506
You're not gettin' the fuckin' ass.

88
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:05,843
What if this turns out to be one of them
Catch a Predator deals?

89
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,415
Who we preyin' on?

90
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:10,884
We're the fuckin' minors here.
She's the one who says she's 38.

91
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:14,184
Jesus. It's gonna be like fucking my mom.

92
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,225
I ain't sure it ain't
your mom, motherfucker.

93
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,352
- Fuck you.
- I don't think I should go, man.

94
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:21,589
I'm having some doubts over here.

95
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,165
Oh, you're going.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,166
You don't think the three of us
balling this woman in the same room...

97
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:27,998
is a little faggoty?

98
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,937
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't be so fuckin' middle-class.

99
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,072
I'm gonna take the car out, all right?

100
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:37,908
No, no, no. Hey, we're gonna be
on TV in a minute. Watch.

101
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:41,609
This was the scene this morning
outside the funeral of Jacob Harlow...

102
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,845
the 19-year-old whose body
was found last week...

103
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:47,411
in a Dumpster behind a well-known gay bar
on Slattery Drive...

104
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,684
bound head-to-toe in plastic wrap.

105
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:52,556
Harlow is the latest victim
in a rash of hate crimes...

106
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:54,323
that have rocked the city this year.

107
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,594
Pastor Abin Cooper and the members
Of his Five Points Trinity Church...

108
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:03,263
staged their 432nd
funeral demonstration since 2001.

109
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:05,307
- This is Catherine Carlyle...
- Oh, oh, oh! There we are.

110
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,239
There we are.

111
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:10,744
- I'm sleeping with a TV star tonight.
- Yeah, you are.

112
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,371
How'd you know
we were gonna be on there?

113
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:14,973
Barbara called me.
She saw it on the 5:00 news.

114
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,484
So you gonna tell your friends
we're famous?

115
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,885
- Probably not.
- Smart ass.

116
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,650
Where you off to tonight?

117
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:24,750
I don't know. Just gonna drive around
with Jarod and Billy-Ray.

118
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,829
Probably go see a movie or something.

119
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,954
Fill up the tank before you bring it back.

120
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,057
- Can I get some money for gas?
- No.

121
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,760
Later.

122
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:49,879
So how are we gonna do this?

123
00:06:52,822 --> 00:06:54,289
How do you mean?

124
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,483
Talkin' about how are you
gonna get under us.

125
00:06:56,592 --> 00:07:00,187
- What are you talking about?
- Me and the lady.

126
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,025
You fuckin'...

127
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,763
This is what happens when fuckin' parents
block porn sites, man.

128
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,700
They make socially backwards kids.

129
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:11,330
How about you just pull over
and let me out.

130
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,341
Come on, man. You're being...
Oh, fuck!

131
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,574
- You hit it.
- Fuck.

132
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,149
You fuckin' hit it.

133
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,684
Why the fuck are we gettin' out?

134
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:28,188
It's so fuckin' dark out
no one could see us if they were looking.

135
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:32,057
Holy shit! Look at your fuckin' car.

136
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,823
Your fuckin' car!

137
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:37,092
- Are you kidding me?
- Holy shit, man.

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,896
Dude, that's, like, a lot of... damage.

139
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,129
That sucks, man.

140
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:46,265
Who the fuck parks their car
on the side of the road like that?

141
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,842
You think there's somebody in there?

142
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,809
I don't know, man. Nobody's here.

143
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:51,573
Why the fuck did you stop?

144
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,979
Oh, fuck. You got 'em real good.

145
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:56,216
- Holy fuck!
- Fuck!

146
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,651
- Fuck!
- Get in the car! Get in the car!

147
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,152
They ain't following us.

148
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:09,231
Why in the fuck was that guy
on the side of the road?

149
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:11,766
Who cares, man?
Let's just keep fuckin' going.

150
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,564
- My car's fucked up, man!
- Well, guess what.

151
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,900
Your car's gonna be fucked up
when you get home too.

152
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,530
So why don't we just keep going?

153
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:20,233
We're in Cooper's Dell already.

154
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,311
We'll hate ourselves tomorrow
if we don't do this.

155
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:25,847
- I'm not gonna hate myself.
- I'm gonna hate not getting that pussy...

156
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:28,917
so let's not take this little
fender-bender as a bad omen, boys.

157
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,680
Let's fucking do this!

158
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,791
Lasso me some pussy!

159
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,161
She lives in a trailer?

160
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,500
You live in a trailer, motherfucker.

161
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:52,900
I was just askin'. Damn.

162
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:16,631
You Jarod?

163
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:25,601
This here is Travis, and that's Billy-Ray.

164
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,947
I bet you boys wanna get up
to the devil's business, don't you?

165
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:42,081
Well, devil's right in here.

166
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,565
You look lovely.

167
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,000
How 'bout a beer, boys?

168
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,966
Hey, Pete. Can you believe it?
I got sideswiped tonight.

169
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,535
- You get 'em?
- No.

170
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:31,437
I was parked and they kept movin'.

171
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:35,209
Why were you parked?

172
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:41,739
Oh, I was makin' a reservation for Helen,
tomorrow night for our 19th.

173
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,978
I'm thinking about taking Darla
someplace special...

174
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:46,247
for our fifth next month.

175
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,983
Someplace overseas, you know?

176
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:52,219
Like maybe Italy.

177
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:54,319
Soon as I win enough off these doggies.

178
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,730
Well, win enough to do this damn body work
on my car, would ya?

179
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:01,870
Dumb-ass kids.

180
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,006
How you know they was kids?

181
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:07,735
I don't know.
They was in some kind of Mom-mobile.

182
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:11,870
Suppose that's mighty keen
detecting skills there, Sheriff.

183
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,710
Yeah, well...

184
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:17,547
I'm gonna need you
to go out there and find 'em.

185
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:21,755
You kiddin' me?
I'm off the clock 10 minutes now.

186
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:24,155
The only reason I'm still here
is 'cause you're so damn late.

187
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,661
Jesus Christ. Just go out
and find the damn car, will ya?

188
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:30,960
It's a blue Volvo station wagon.

189
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:50,085
Geez.

190
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:52,654
This is nice.

191
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,987
You boys finished your beers yet?

192
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,286
- I'm workin' on it.
- Almost. Almost.

193
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:05,162
Takes me a few beers
to work up to the sex.

194
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:11,635
So get drinkin',
'cause I ain't drinkin' alone.

195
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:17,576
And I don't let no man in me
unless he's got at least two beers in him.

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,271
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,847
Makes sense.

198
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:29,691
This is nice.

199
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,487
Will you close your fuckin' legs?

200
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,765
It's like a shag.

201
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:42,037
So how's about you head back
into the bedroom...

202
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:46,097
start strippin' down
so we can get this thing started.

203
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:49,911
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,675
Almost don't even fit in here.

205
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:02,785
Get them beers drunk.

206
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,121
This bitch wants my dick, don't she?

207
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:09,288
She is a lot better looking.

208
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,834
Them tits ain't nothin'
to write home about.

209
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:14,561
Those tits are...

210
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,805
Fuck!

211
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,700
What the fuck?

212
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:29,880
Fuckin' roofies.

213
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,773
Hello?

214
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,243
Guys?

215
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,846
Is that you, Travis? Billy-Ray?

216
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:14,428
On a hill far away

217
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,361
All right, guys, come on.
Seriously, let me outta here.

218
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:19,923
Can you just let me outta here, please?

219
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:23,402
The emblem of suffering...

220
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:26,702
Guys, this isn't fuckin' funny, all right?
Will you let me outta here, please!

221
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,777
What the fuck is going on?

222
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,211
Let me the fuck outta here,
please, all right?

223
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,748
This isn't funny anymore.

224
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,478
This isn't fuckin' funny anymore.
This isn't funny anymore, man.

225
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,747
Come on, let me the fuck out!

226
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:41,550
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

227
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:43,056
Let me out!

228
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:46,423
If you guys don't let me
the fuck outta here, I'm gonna kill you!

229
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,928
I will cherish

230
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:53,024
The old rugged cross

231
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,062
Will you find somebody to...

232
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,970
Can somebody please let me outta here?
Please?

233
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:02,134
- Lucas, sit down.
- Fuckin' bitch.

234
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:03,711
Hey, you fuckin' bitch!

235
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,973
Let me the fuck outta here,
you fuckin' bitch!

236
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,140
The old rugged cross

237
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,717
Fuck!

238
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,923
And exchange it someday

239
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:20,894
For a crown

240
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,961
Well, how about that?

241
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,229
That was lovely.

242
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:31,135
Just lovely.

243
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,732
Y'all give that Mormon Tabernacle Choir
a run for their money.

244
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,506
You know what this is?

245
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,508
That's a printout of what we done today.

246
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:44,711
That's an article that appears
in tomorrow's Post.

247
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,617
You know what that's called?

248
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,482
National coverage.

249
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,720
- Sure was.
- Indeed, it was.

250
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,225
Abigail...

251
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,493
TiVo'd the segment on the 5:00 news.

252
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,702
Y'all can watch it later if you want to...

253
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:04,204
and see yourselves on the TV.

254
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,876
Yeah, tell you what
we gonna do next week.

255
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,470
We gonna paint the garage.

256
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,549
I know how you love that,
but we gonna paint.

257
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,379
Someone, please!
Come on, please!

258
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,817
I need big, strong volunteers.
How about you?

259
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:23,156
How about you? You big and strong?

260
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,856
RJ?

261
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:30,090
Show me how Popeye do.

262
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,601
Popeye!

263
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,331
Yeah, oh, wow! Don't hurt me, Popeye.

264
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,339
Oh, Popeye, don't hurt me.

265
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:42,410
Will somebody please
let me the fuck outta here!

266
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:46,003
Caleb, come on, now.
That's a bit much. Now, come on, come on.

267
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,450
No! Fuck! Fuck!

268
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,522
- Welcome, family.
- Good evenin'.

269
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:06,897
- Good evenin', Granddaddy.
- Good evenin', Grandpa.

270
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,629
Good evening.

271
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,898
But what's so good about it?

272
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:15,306
Psalms 117, verse 24.

273
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:19,245
"This is the day which the Lord hath made.

274
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:22,784
We will rejoice and be glad in it."

275
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,477
Glad in it.

276
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,952
"Oh, woe is me
if I preach not the gospels."

277
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:29,923
Corinthians 9:16.

278
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,390
Amen, Grandpa.

279
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:36,323
Oh, well, I think
I'm gonna preach that holy word.

280
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,899
- Preach it, Daddy.
- Yes.

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,935
We read in Hebrews 11...

282
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,167
By faith... by faith...

283
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:50,371
Noah, being warned by God
of things not seen as yet...

284
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,172
prepared an ark...

285
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,611
for the savin' of his house...

286
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:58,447
by which he condemned all others.

287
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:01,022
For there was multitudes
upon multitudes of people...

288
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,591
and God drowned them
all except Noah and his flock.

289
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:06,217
Drowned them all.
All sinners gone to hell.

290
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:07,795
Praise his name.

291
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:11,992
I'm good at climbing.
I'm good at climbing.

292
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:19,269
You talk to some of them maudlin,
touchy-feely preachers out there...

293
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:22,002
peddlin' their soft faith...

294
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,806
they gonna tell you what you wanna hear.

295
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:27,378
They ain't gonna tell you
what you need to know.

296
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,883
They can't. Can't tell you the truth.

297
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:34,319
Why, it might be politically incorrect.

298
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,991
But they'll tell you...

299
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:39,526
this nation and the world
is goin' to hell.

300
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:42,461
They won't tell you why.
Can't tell you why.

301
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:45,095
They'll tell you...

302
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,134
"God loves you.

303
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,933
God loves everybody."

304
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:56,475
Does a God that drowned the entire world,
exception of Noah and his flock...

305
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:59,911
sound like a God that loves you?

306
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:00,982
No.

307
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,643
That sound like a God
that forgives your sins?

308
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:05,219
- No!
- No, sir.

309
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,151
Your carnal desires?

310
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,390
That's not God's love.

311
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:12,551
That's a God that abhors the wicked.

312
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:15,596
He abhors those
that ignore his righteous teaching...

313
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,023
and forsake his covenant...

314
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,897
and scoff at his acts.

315
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:24,529
God doesn't love you...

316
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,131
unless you fear him.

317
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,643
We talk about a fear we have
of certain snakes.

318
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:36,376
Well, that'd be a righteous fear.

319
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,578
We talkin' about a fear we have
of takin' a cookie...

320
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:40,848
Grandma's cookie jar...

321
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,753
'fraid of being caught?

322
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,220
I don't believe so.

323
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:49,127
Talkin' about the fear of God. I fear God.

324
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,461
You better believe I fear God.

325
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:55,295
But my fear is born out of respect...

326
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,372
- Oh, fuck.
- Admiration...

327
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,303
devotion...

328
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,205
sacrifice...

329
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:03,867
adoration...

330
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,946
and knowledge of the scripture...

331
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:10,575
that I preach.

332
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:13,484
Give us some knowledge, Daddy.
Give us some knowledge.

333
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,114
But I preach knowledge,
and I preach to this...

334
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:19,991
and I preach, and I preach...

335
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.

336
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:27,558
I preach like my daddy before me,
and his daddy before him.

337
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:32,135
My granddaddy built this church
goin' on a hundred years ago.

338
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:34,004
He used to minister up there...

339
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:38,239
at the 12th St. Baptist
up there in the city...

340
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:44,145
till he couldn't stomach
what he called the deviltry anymore.

341
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:48,121
So he abandoned that modern-day Gomorrah
and settled Cooper's Dell...

342
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:51,021
June, 1917.

343
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:55,693
But if he thought people
were depraved back then...

344
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,090
I mean, his head'd nearly burst...

345
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,999
if he saw how wicked
this country's become.

346
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,072
I hate the wickedness of America...

347
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:07,674
and all the sin-worshippers
who populate it.

348
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:10,506
"Do I not hate them, O Lord,
that hate thee?"

349
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:12,170
Says in Psalms 138...

350
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,875
"Am I not grieved by those
that rise up against thee?"

351
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,952
I hate them with a perfect hatred.

352
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:22,045
"I count them mine enemies."

353
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,920
Twenty-one, 22.

354
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:28,326
And who's the greatest enemy
of God, Cheyenne?

355
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,398
- Satan.
- Satan.

356
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,062
- That's right, baby.
- Satan.

357
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,161
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:40,173
And who's Satan's instrument
on earth, Fiona May?

359
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:41,640
The homosexuals.

360
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:46,406
That's right, baby. The homosexuals.

361
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:52,749
The homosexuals have run amok
in this nation over 30 years now.

362
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,651
Let's see what it's brought us.

363
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,985
Rampant fornication...

364
00:21:58,093 --> 00:21:59,560
adultery...

365
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:01,527
abortion...

366
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,495
flagrant sexuality...

367
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:07,125
in every corner of media...
movies, TV, et cetera.

368
00:22:07,235 --> 00:22:09,726
Schools, malls, books...

369
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:13,865
clothes, toys, music...

370
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:15,704
Everywhere.

371
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,608
Everywhere!

372
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:22,173
You can't turn on the TV without seeing
some jackass wavin' his privates.

373
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:27,320
That's because the moral spine
of this country has been weakened...

374
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:29,754
by permissive attitudes...

375
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:33,555
and an unabashed tolerance
for homosexuals.

376
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:35,630
Godlessness.

377
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,057
Godlessness.

378
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:43,429
The casual acceptance of the gay...

379
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:45,403
has hastened our demise as a species.

380
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:49,375
Fact. Why? Because they do not procreate.

381
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:51,776
They do not procreate.

382
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,976
Now, they solicit. Yeah, boy.

383
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,574
They recruit.

384
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:59,153
Yeah, boy.

385
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:01,883
But they do not procreate.

386
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,117
Is there anyone...

387
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,626
anyone... who can look at the news...

388
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:10,789
and deny these are our end times?

389
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:14,801
Outside our fence lays a world at waste.

390
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:19,304
They's famine, such as in Africa...

391
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:22,377
pestilence, such as the gay AIDS.

392
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:29,479
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes and the
ensuing floods, such as New Orleans...

393
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:32,109
New Orleans is number one sin city.

394
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,654
Thailand... Thailand!

395
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,984
Thailand...

396
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:42,325
where pederasts travel
thousands of miles...

397
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:45,059
spend untold amounts of money...

398
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,701
to sodomize a child.

399
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:52,638
A baby.

400
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:01,108
Thousands upon thousands
dead in that tsunami.

401
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:05,619
I never saw the hand of God
so clearly in all my born days.

402
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:09,618
And the Lord's bore witness
to this apostasy.

403
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,920
Apostasy... The leaving of faith,
the denying of religion...

404
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,997
denying of morality.

405
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:19,099
He's done with it.

406
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:21,735
He's done with it.

407
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:24,829
The end is nigh.

408
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,908
- The end is nigh.
- Yes, it is.

409
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:32,970
Cheyenne, bunny rabbit...

410
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,647
do you mind taking
the children out now for the lesson...

411
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:40,881
'cause it's gonna get grown up in here.

412
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,582
You ready?

413
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,922
Come on, babies. Grandpa loves you.

414
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,517
Come on.

415
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:49,756
Gimme your hand there. Come on.

416
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:51,992
Come here. Come on, sweetie.

417
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,466
When you get finished today in school...

418
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,730
I want you to tell me
all about it, will ya?

419
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:58,635
Will you tell me about it later?

420
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:02,207
I wish you'd talk to me sometime.

421
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:16,954
Would y'all like to see
who we have to thank...

422
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,993
for the extinction of the human race?

423
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,520
It.

424
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,530
Y'all know about that Worldwide Web.

425
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:32,704
Yeah, that's the devil's playground.

426
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:35,139
We harnessed the devils' technology...

427
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,406
went out like sheep amongst wolves...

428
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:41,778
into them homosexually oriented
chat rooms...

429
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,713
and we promised them boys
what they wanted to hear.

430
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:49,247
Just like an insect...

431
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:54,962
just like moths to a flame,
like flies to horseshit.

432
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,962
Insects. Insects...

433
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:01,092
that are easily trapped
in that snare of God...

434
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:03,102
on that there Web.

435
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:06,799
And we gonna deal with 'em
the way God taught us to deal with 'em...

436
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:09,809
the way we dealt
with little Jacob Harlow...

437
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,539
who burns in hell as we speak.

438
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,283
Now...

439
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:22,282
there's a commandment
talks against killin', isn't it?

440
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,382
There's a commandment
speaks against killin'.

441
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,461
God's talking about your fellow man.

442
00:26:27,562 --> 00:26:30,122
He's not talking about this... insect.

443
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:34,133
I mean, you don't mourn the death
of a germ when it's been cured.

444
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:37,000
And a homosexual...

445
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:39,437
won't stop sinnin' of its own volition...

446
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:44,137
and it's up to the righteous
to curb the spread of its disease.

447
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:47,339
"If a man also lie with mankind..."

448
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,212
as he lies with a woman...

449
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,615
they both have committed an abomination...

450
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,814
"and they shall surely be put to death."

451
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:58,518
- That is the scripture.
- No. No!

452
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:01,653
That is scripture.

453
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:06,132
Well, the wrath of God...

454
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,035
is revealed from heaven...

455
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,332
against all ungodliness.

456
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,240
No! Please, help!

457
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,812
Help!

458
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:26,049
Now tape him up good, boys.
Now you watch that gay saliva.

459
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:28,850
If it gets on ya, it can turn ya.

460
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:31,892
Don't get it near his orifices, now.

461
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,396
- Shut up!
- Send the sinner straight to hell.

462
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,366
Come on, baby.
Send the sinner straight to hell.

463
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:41,765
Shut your mouth!

464
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:49,202
Send him off wrapped like a package.

465
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,355
Come on, Caleb.

466
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,297
Burn in hell, cocksucker.

467
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:16,731
No!

468
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:18,100
Caleb, head hole.

469
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:28,615
Let us out of here!
We didn't do anything!

470
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:30,480
Let us the fuck out of here!

471
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,075
Oh, man!

472
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,744
Let us out! Let us out of here, please!

473
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,621
All right. Get that other one.

474
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:39,057
Oh, fuck.

475
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,321
Oh, God. I ain't gay! Please!

476
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,192
Don't! No! No!

477
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:45,129
No, look, I ain't even gay!

478
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,928
Please, no! No!

479
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:49,128
Please! I ain't even gay!

480
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:51,967
I ain't even gay. I ain't even gay!

481
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:53,506
Please!

482
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,803
Stop. I ain't even gay! Please!

483
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,468
Let me go! Please!

484
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,980
- Jarod!
- Travis! Billy-Ray!

485
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:05,678
What the fuck are you doing? God!

486
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,255
- Take it easy, kid.
- I ain't even gay! I ain't even gay!

487
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:09,914
You might be worse.

488
00:29:10,024 --> 00:29:14,620
Came to these woods to share a woman
with other men in the same bed.

489
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,788
Will somebody please fuckin' help me!

490
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:22,700
Fornicatin' ways, they caused the
destruction of both Sodom and Gomorrah.

491
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,294
I don't wanna die!

492
00:29:24,405 --> 00:29:26,100
You already did, sinner.

493
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:28,266
You destroyed your spirit...

494
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:30,867
in a waste of shame.

495
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:03,167
Hey, Billy-Ray.

496
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,337
Fuck.

497
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:07,038
Hey, Billy-Ray.

498
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:16,548
They gonna do us like they did that guy.

499
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,421
Not if we can get outta here first, man.

500
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,586
- They gonna kill us!
- Listen. Listen to me.

501
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,995
I think a bone snapped out of this dead
guy's skin when they dropped him...

502
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:27,761
because I feel something stabbing my leg.

503
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,429
What the fuck, man? What the fuck?

504
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,701
I think I can fuckin'
tear through this paper...

505
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,537
if you can just fuckin'
lean back a little bit.

506
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:37,372
Just work with me here a little bit.

507
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:38,945
Just tell me what I gotta do.

508
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,210
Lean back a little bit
so I can lean forward. Just work with me.

509
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:44,080
Oh, no. No.

510
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:45,880
Really, no. Fuckin' lean into me, man.

511
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:47,852
Do you wanna fuckin' die?
Do you wanna fuckin' die?

512
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:50,015
Then fuckin' listen to me
and we'll go home, all right?

513
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:52,524
Stop being a fuckin' baby
and let's fucking get outta here, man.

514
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:54,925
Just lean back a little bit.

515
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:56,519
All right?

516
00:30:56,631 --> 00:31:01,432
Just relax and lean back
just a little bit so I can lean forward.

517
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:04,232
If I can get the bone on the thing...

518
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,897
Just can't see straight.

519
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:07,634
Hurry, Trav.

520
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:11,071
It's only tape, man.

521
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,979
I just want my mom.
I really want my mom.

522
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,456
Oh, you can't do it.

523
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:36,696
Electronic gate.
It's got one of them magnetic locks on it.

524
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,268
- That's why I couldn't...
- Yeah.

525
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:41,274
I'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor.

526
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:42,968
That's all right.

527
00:31:43,077 --> 00:31:46,604
You're a man of the law.
What can I do for you, Officer?

528
00:31:46,714 --> 00:31:48,841
I'm following up on a report
of a traffic accident.

529
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,408
Station wagon sideswiped a car
out on Route 9.

530
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,148
Oh, my Lord. Anybody hurt?

531
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:58,657
No, sir. There was no one
in the car at the time...

532
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:03,424
but I see you got a wagon over there
with some damage...

533
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,931
that matches the description.

534
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:09,001
Fuck!

535
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,593
Oh, fuck. I'm free. I'm free.

536
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,672
I'm free.

537
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:18,335
- I tell 'em and I tell 'em and I tell 'em.
- Sir?

538
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:20,710
That's my granddaughters'.

539
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:23,978
Once in a while they go into town,
you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.

540
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:27,782
Whatever. I believe they're your culprits.

541
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,380
You know, it's not
politically correct to say...

542
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,652
but women and cars...

543
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,228
Not a good mix.

544
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,737
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- Oh, fuck!

545
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:51,540
Go.

546
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:55,806
Go, man! Hurry!

547
00:32:56,918 --> 00:32:59,352
It's too fuckin' tight, Trav.

548
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:01,183
I can't fuckin' do it. It's too tight.

549
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,257
Billy-Ray! Where are you goin'?

550
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,849
Billy-Ray, don't fuckin' go.
Where the fuck are you goin'?

551
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,427
I can't fuckin' do it!

552
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,158
I'm sorry!

553
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:13,256
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:17,065
If I could, I'd like to keep
them insurance devils out of it.

555
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:19,537
You know, rates are high as it is...

556
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,041
and I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity around here.

557
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:25,111
Well, no, I guess not.

558
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,773
So if you can put me in touch
with whoever it is, you know...

559
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:31,318
that owns the car that they scraped up...

560
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:33,046
why I can talk to 'em personal.

561
00:33:33,154 --> 00:33:35,987
Maybe get him some financial restitution.

562
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,718
Make up for it, you know.

563
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:40,794
I mean, if you could.

564
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:44,965
I mean, there's only cosmetic damage,
you know. Nobody was hurt.

565
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,604
I guess that'd be fine.
I'll just phone it in to y'all in the morning.

566
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,646
I thank you so much for that.
I'm much obliged.

567
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,578
- Hey, you have a good night.
- You too.

568
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:02,649
Oh, fuck!

569
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:10,090
Pastor, excuse me.

570
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:12,216
Sorry. I got one last thing.

571
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:16,092
I remember you went over to the Vatican
to protest that dead pope's funeral...

572
00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:17,960
a few years back.

573
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,830
And I guess what I'm saying is...

574
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:24,629
is Italy nice?

575
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:39,115
Oh, my God.

576
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,686
- Italy?
- Yeah.

577
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,385
I was thinking about taking my wife
someplace exotic for our five-year...

578
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:49,952
and, well, Italy was at
the top of the list.

579
00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:53,033
Well, it's full of Italians.
There is that.

580
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,329
Full of Italians, huh?

581
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:58,428
Yeah, I suppose that stands to reason.

582
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:01,099
- All right, you have a good night.
- Thank you.

583
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,504
Oh, fuck.

584
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,012
Let's fuckin' do this!

585
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,237
Motherfucker.

586
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,830
Sheriff, I got shots fired
inside of Five Points. Repeat. I have...

587
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:35,408
Shots fired.

588
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,343
Repeat, shots fired inside of Five Points.

589
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:41,506
Wait a minute. In Cooper's church?

590
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:43,208
Immediate backup requested.

591
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,911
- Repeat, immediate backup requested.
- I got him, Daddy.

592
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,749
Jesus.

593
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,425
Pete!

594
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,518
Was that a gunshot, Pete?

595
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:56,426
Pete, you still there?

596
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,160
Pete!

597
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:04,170
Is this that obese queer,
likes to sodomize wetbacks out on Route 9?

598
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:12,404
Who is this? Where's my deputy?

599
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:15,243
Yeah, God sees all, Mr. Queer.

600
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:17,579
God takes pictures too...

601
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:20,085
unseemly photographs of men on men...

602
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:23,521
backwards, sweaty,
lust-filled carnal knowledge.

603
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:26,889
That fun for you, Mr. Queer...

604
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:30,794
have a man in your mouth not a mile
from my house of worship?

605
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:35,130
Now, there was some
unpleasantness out here tonight.

606
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,828
You just let us clean it up...

607
00:36:36,938 --> 00:36:40,032
and I won't send
any pictures of you to the missus...

608
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,608
or the Courier...

609
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:43,904
those images of how you like
to use that mouth.

610
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:47,708
And I don't means stuffin' it
with Moon Pies and Coca-Cola.

611
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:49,282
I tell you what.

612
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:52,147
What about that picture of you
wiping the feces of that wetback...

613
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,982
off of your scrotum and genitalia?

614
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,749
I think the missus would like that one.

615
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:57,687
She'd put it on the mantel
at Christmastime...

616
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,260
right between them two stockings.

617
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,230
Yeah, you keep your queerhole shut,
Sheriff...

618
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,393
everything gonna be just fine.

619
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,135
What happened in there?

620
00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:17,973
Them kids was cuttin'
themselves loose downstairs.

621
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,071
Caleb went to deal with it.

622
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:24,583
Shootin' 'em up while I'm out there
with this law dog.

623
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:27,245
You want me to move his car
on the property?

624
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,557
No.

625
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:33,126
Take him on across town.

626
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:36,321
Other side of the tracks,
dump him off there.

627
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,389
Them Feds get rather investigative
when it comes to killin' one of their own.

628
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:22,374
Hello?

629
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:23,943
This is Keenan.

630
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,106
I'm sorry. Who now?

631
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,550
Yes, sir.

632
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:33,415
That case is under
preliminary investigation.

633
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:42,453
Report was members of the church
were seeking semiautomatic firearms...

634
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:46,226
mid-2004, before AWB expired.

635
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:49,132
We have unconfirmed reports
they got a few.

636
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,907
Well, the intelligence suggests
that they were modifying the weapons.

637
00:38:58,012 --> 00:39:01,209
At least that was the testimony
of the guy who sold 'em some shotguns.

638
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:04,751
He said they made inquiries
about modifications.

639
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:10,487
No, sir. Undercover infiltration
was unsuccessful.

640
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:12,058
Can you...

641
00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:15,327
I'm sorry. Sir?

642
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,057
Can I call you back?

643
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,091
Yes, sir. Thank you.
It'll just be a few minutes.

644
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,437
Oh, shit.

645
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:37,278
If you loved me,
you'd make me some coffee.

646
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,617
Caleb?

647
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:45,851
Darlin'?

648
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:51,095
Oh, no!

649
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:53,462
No, Caleb!

650
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:57,594
Come on, baby doll. Come on.

651
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:59,195
Come on. Come on.

652
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:01,740
I know. I know, baby. I know.

653
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,267
Timothy 4, baby doll.

654
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:05,845
Timothy 4.

655
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:09,949
Timothy 4, baby. Timothy 4.

656
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,076
"I am now ready to be offered."

657
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:17,021
The time for my departure is at hand.

658
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,285
I have fought a good fight.

659
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,827
I have fought a good fight.

660
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,956
I have finished my course.

661
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,795
"I have kept the faith."

662
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:33,039
He's on the lovin' breast of Jesus, baby.

663
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,376
He's gone to Jesus.

664
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:40,512
I know, baby. I know. I know.

665
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:42,081
Come on.

666
00:40:42,183 --> 00:40:43,810
Let me show you something, sweetie.

667
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:45,852
Let me show you something. Come on.

668
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,222
I want you to see something with me now.

669
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,449
- Lookee here.
- What?

670
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:52,150
Lookee here.

671
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,318
Caleb did not die in vain.

672
00:40:54,428 --> 00:40:57,226
He sent them two devils to hell
before they killed him.

673
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:01,967
Probably saved us all
with his last dyin' breath.

674
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,841
You go rot in hell, you filthy, filthy...

675
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:16,849
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

676
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:18,782
Come on. We got one upstairs.

677
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:20,513
Save it for him.

678
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:24,318
- Save it for him. Am I right?
- Oh, Daddy, you're always right.

679
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:26,757
There's a land

680
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:30,490
Beyond the river

681
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:32,691
That they call

682
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,736
The sweet forever

683
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:40,967
And you only reach that shore

684
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:44,875
By fate's decree

685
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:50,918
By and by we'll cross the portal

686
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:57,150
Where we'll dwell with thee, immortal

687
00:41:57,258 --> 00:42:01,024
When they ring those golden bells

688
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:04,063
They're a pretty tight-knit group.

689
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:08,658
Approximately 20, 25 members...

690
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:12,102
all related by blood or marriage.

691
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:17,337
Makes it impossible
to get any coverts inside.

692
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:19,241
No, sir.

693
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:23,112
You're thinking of Fred Phelps
and his family up in Kansas.

694
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:25,777
"God hates fags."

695
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:29,049
They're irritating,
but they're not gun nuts like the Coopers.

696
00:42:32,026 --> 00:42:33,960
They're suers, not doers.

697
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:36,689
Last April someone at Five Points...

698
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:40,927
reported an I ED setup
on church property.

699
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:44,232
No injuries sustained
and minimal damage done to a tree...

700
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:46,898
but in an interview
with the local media...

701
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:51,239
Cooper claimed that if a bomb had gone off
in a synagogue, a black church...

702
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:53,836
or a homo-friendly Unitarian coven...

703
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,279
there'd have been an uproar.

704
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:57,373
No suspects, no arrests.

705
00:42:57,484 --> 00:43:00,476
Local law enforcement
chalked it up to townie kids...

706
00:43:00,588 --> 00:43:02,647
having fun at the church's expense.

707
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:06,783
But it spooked the Coopers into tearing
down all the barns on their property...

708
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:09,454
turning 'em into barricade fences.

709
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:12,191
Locals call it "the great
wall of bullshit."

710
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:16,263
Yes, sir, after the one in China.

711
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:20,399
What made 'em persons of interest...

712
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:24,841
was an interview Cooper gave
to the Patriot Times right about then.

713
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:27,379
He said that
"If the law won't protect us...

714
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:29,745
from the Philistines and sodomites...

715
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,715
"we'll protect ourselves."

716
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,448
You couple that comment with the
allegations, and you can see why...

717
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:39,422
We've had 'em on surveillance off and on.

718
00:43:39,526 --> 00:43:41,118
They're pretty easy to keep track of.

719
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:43,662
When they're not protesting gay bars
or chasing headlines...

720
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:45,789
they mostly stick to their compound...

721
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:47,526
hold their daily services.

722
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,173
I know I'm low man
on the totem pole...

723
00:43:57,277 --> 00:43:59,802
but are you sure that's wise
at this juncture, sir?

724
00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:05,210
Why? Because if you give us
a few more days...

725
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:08,777
I'm sure we can dig up something
more substantial than the sheriff's...

726
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:15,418
That's how you wanna play it.

727
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:18,225
No, sir, I'm not questioning
your call at all, sir.

728
00:44:18,332 --> 00:44:22,291
I'm saying that our history with
situations like this hasn't been exactly...

729
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,405
Yes, sir. It's dawn here now...

730
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:34,379
but we can be fully mobilized
and on site in an hour.

731
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:37,483
I understand.

732
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:12,318
Fuck!

733
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:20,558
Tempted and tried

734
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:24,324
We're oft made to wonder

735
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:28,162
Why it should be

736
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:31,396
All the day long

737
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:36,465
While there are others

738
00:45:36,577 --> 00:45:40,104
Living about us

739
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:43,706
Never molested

740
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:47,412
Doing wrong

741
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:51,721
When death has come

742
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:55,454
And taken our loved one

743
00:45:55,562 --> 00:45:59,259
It makes our hearts

744
00:45:59,366 --> 00:46:03,427
So weary and drear

745
00:46:04,338 --> 00:46:08,604
Then do we wonder

746
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:12,543
Why others prosper

747
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:16,980
Living so wicked

748
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:21,453
Year after year

749
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:27,721
Farther along we'll know all about it

750
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:35,933
Farther along we'll understand why

751
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:40,496
Cheer up, my brother

752
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:44,065
Live in the sunshine

753
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:49,639
We'll understand it all by and by

754
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,741
Come, sweetie. Come. Come.

755
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,287
Farther along

756
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,759
We'll know all about it

757
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:06,965
Farther along
we'll understand why

758
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:27,217
All by and by

759
00:47:47,774 --> 00:47:48,741
Fuck!

760
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:55,042
Fast little monkey!

761
00:48:14,301 --> 00:48:17,065
Who fired? Who fired, goddamn it!

762
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,501
Local Agent 3.

763
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,344
Goddamn it!

764
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,640
- What are you...
- Who the fuck are you?

765
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:29,443
Did he fire at us?

766
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:31,779
- No, he was armed.
- Did he open fire at us?

767
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:34,251
- Son of a bitch had a machine gun!
- They got kids in there, asshole!

768
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:37,118
- Sorry! I'm sorry.
- Kids you just turned into hostages!

769
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:38,589
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Asshole!

770
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:42,025
You can't talk to me, you son of a bitch.
I am a King's County elected official!

771
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:45,223
Sit your ass back in your vehicle!

772
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:47,800
Now!

773
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:09,317
How much you think
a cross like that costs?

774
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:13,225
You mean in dollars or common sense?

775
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,056
Zing!

776
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:23,828
We get the spike mic set up?

777
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:27,338
Well, we were about to,
and then Barney Fife happened.

778
00:49:28,442 --> 00:49:30,307
Well...

779
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,811
Let's go old-school.
We get any blueprints or whatnot?

780
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,710
- 1922.
- It's all county had.

781
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,257
They haven't built an addition to the original
structure for the last 50 years. No permits.

782
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:48,089
They got anything on four legs
except horses we gotta look out for?

783
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:50,425
Isn't this a stable?

784
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,498
No, that's Home Depot.

785
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,728
It was a stud farm. Belonged to the
last neighbors the Coopers ever had...

786
00:49:56,837 --> 00:49:58,896
before Abin drove 'em off
and bought the land.

787
00:49:59,006 --> 00:50:03,773
That's where they load up with all the lumber
so they can build this elegant fucking fence.

788
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:08,576
Million-dollar views from three directions
and then, bam! "Casa de Bat Shit."

789
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:11,845
Do you know how you get
a valley this beautiful all to yourself?

790
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:15,012
Put a giant fucking cross
on your front lawn.

791
00:50:15,122 --> 00:50:16,749
Give me the horn.

792
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:26,764
This is Special Agent
Joseph Keenan of the ATF.

793
00:50:27,534 --> 00:50:30,662
We're here to execute
a search warrant on the premises...

794
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:34,707
on suspicion of violation
of the National Firearms Act.

795
00:50:34,808 --> 00:50:40,246
Put down any weapons, come out with
your hands up, and you will not be harmed.

796
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:44,374
Repeat: You will not be harmed.

797
00:50:53,727 --> 00:50:57,424
I think it's the use of the word "repeat"
that makes this work every time.

798
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:18,675
You wanna breach?

799
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:23,987
No.

800
00:51:25,158 --> 00:51:26,625
Give 'em a minute.

801
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,255
Get a line opened up.

802
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,357
Yeah, that's gonna...

803
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,105
Come on!

804
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,870
Goddamn it!

805
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:45,672
Get down! Agent, get down!

806
00:51:54,888 --> 00:51:55,855
Right now!

807
00:51:58,158 --> 00:51:59,716
This is Special Agent Keenan, sir.

808
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,954
Cooper's Dell has escalated
into a firefight.

809
00:52:03,063 --> 00:52:05,031
Requesting backup.

810
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:07,225
Get the fuck outta here. Go grab a rifle.

811
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:11,393
The local sheriff shot
and killed an armed assailant.

812
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,997
We C-C'd. They opened fire.

813
00:52:15,108 --> 00:52:17,008
They shot Brooks.

814
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,600
The fucking church people!

815
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,377
They're heavy with AK's and TECs.

816
00:52:22,482 --> 00:52:23,972
I need backup now!

817
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,851
You said this was gonna be
a simple in-and-out, sir.

818
00:52:34,828 --> 00:52:36,659
Simple just shit itself.

819
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,564
Media, sir?

820
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:44,265
The closest TV station's
a hundred miles away.

821
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,066
The local paper prints once a week.

822
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:47,834
Media's not a factor, sir.

823
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:56,482
Sir, that sounds like...

824
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,384
With all due respect, sir...

825
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:04,616
maybe we should get the deputy
assistant director on this call.

826
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:07,952
Jesus Christ, there's kids in there, sir!

827
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,757
Just give me another 10 minutes.
I can open up a line...

828
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,862
I'm gonna want something in writing
to protect myself and my field office.

829
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,771
No, I'm gonna need something more
substantial than your word for this.

830
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,008
Either I get a text,
or an e-mail, or something official...

831
00:53:30,116 --> 00:53:32,380
I can stand behind or it's no-go.

832
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,157
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

833
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,601
Down! Who else
is coming out that door, huh?

834
00:53:50,704 --> 00:53:52,604
- It's just me.
- Bullshit!

835
00:53:52,706 --> 00:53:54,833
There's kids in there
and I wanna get 'em out.

836
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,648
Is that Group 2?
Are they sending us more agents?

837
00:54:08,755 --> 00:54:11,053
The situation's been reclassified.

838
00:54:11,758 --> 00:54:14,784
We're to take down
this domestic terrorist cell.

839
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:17,260
- We fired on them first, Joe.
- We didn't.

840
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,355
That fat fucking asshole local.

841
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:21,800
What are the orders?

842
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:27,163
Hold on a second. We don't even know
what the goddamn situation is in there.

843
00:54:27,274 --> 00:54:30,573
Our intel is limited. We've had
no fucking communication with them!

844
00:54:30,677 --> 00:54:32,838
"Our investigation
of the Five Point Church..."

845
00:54:32,946 --> 00:54:35,847
at Cooper's Dell
has uncovered an extremely hostile...

846
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:38,679
domestic terrorist cell, heavily armed...

847
00:54:38,785 --> 00:54:41,720
"with intentions of bombing
a local shopping mall this morning."

848
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,288
You're fucking kidding me!

849
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,551
"When we came with arrest warrants,
they opened fire on us..."

850
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:47,854
killing the assistant
special agent in charge...

851
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:51,727
"leaving us no choice but to take
the premises with deadly force."

852
00:54:53,066 --> 00:54:54,829
Jesus Christ.

853
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:57,960
There are women,
and there are kids inside there, man.

854
00:54:58,071 --> 00:55:01,939
"In the resulting firefight,
all suspects were killed."

855
00:55:06,546 --> 00:55:09,037
Give 'em the gas, then dynamic entry.

856
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:11,082
Joe, the suits ain't here.

857
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:15,079
We're here, Joe.
You're here. You can call this.

858
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:17,486
And then what, Harry?

859
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,820
The FBI takes over,
and we look like assholes...

860
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:22,053
who can't do our jobs... again.

861
00:55:22,162 --> 00:55:25,029
That's what happens the minute
a single news van rolls up...

862
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:27,895
and any one of these people
walks out of there alive...

863
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:30,902
goes on CNN and says we're the bad guys.

864
00:55:31,004 --> 00:55:33,768
Doesn't matter who the fuck's around
to tell it to the goddamn news.

865
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:37,070
That's exactly what we're gonna be...
the fucking bad guys!

866
00:55:37,177 --> 00:55:39,145
I got 18 years in.

867
00:55:39,245 --> 00:55:41,805
I'm not telling my wife she's gotta
clip coupons till we're dead...

868
00:55:41,915 --> 00:55:44,850
'cause I couldn't follow a simple order,
shitty as that order is.

869
00:55:44,951 --> 00:55:46,919
And we're not talking about Gandhi here.

870
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,215
I got a piece of Brooks's skull
in my fucking knee.

871
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:51,381
They're shooting at us
with military ordnance.

872
00:55:51,491 --> 00:55:53,652
These ain't a bunch of tweakers
in a motel meth lab.

873
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,455
They are big bad eggs.

874
00:55:59,966 --> 00:56:02,196
Get your men ready for a breach.

875
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:04,699
Sir, I've apprehended one of the suspects.

876
00:56:04,804 --> 00:56:06,271
Unarmed girl, early 20s.

877
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:08,864
She's says she's the caretaker
of the kids in the house.

878
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:12,877
She says she wants to get the kids
out the back without her people knowing.

879
00:56:12,979 --> 00:56:14,446
I think she's legit, sir.

880
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:16,412
Requesting instructions. Over.

881
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:24,081
This is a hostile domestic terrorist cell.

882
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,748
Use of deadly force is permitted.

883
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,926
- She's not even armed. Over.
- We're not terrorists.

884
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:32,361
Those are your goddamn orders.

885
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:35,860
It's the wrong move, Joe.

886
00:56:39,372 --> 00:56:42,569
We're not terrorists.
We're not. You can't do this. Please.

887
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:52,946
- No! We're not terrorists!
- Stay back! Stay back!

888
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:56,112
Please, don't! Please! Oh, God.

889
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:04,087
You need to take this gun
and go back to the house, ma'am.

890
00:57:04,197 --> 00:57:06,028
- Run back to the house.
- I don't want it.

891
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,759
Take the gun and head back
into the house!

892
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:08,891
No! You're gonna shoot me!

893
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:11,163
Take the fucking gun, bitch,
and go to the house!

894
00:57:11,271 --> 00:57:13,171
No! Oh, God!

895
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:17,406
Get in there!

896
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:23,010
Your daddy's dead.

897
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:25,709
This is how you respect his memory?

898
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:28,880
By trying to run out on your family?

899
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:32,185
No. Mama, they think we're terrorists.
They're gonna kill us all.

900
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:33,987
Good.

901
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:36,857
Then I'll be in heaven with Caleb.

902
00:57:36,963 --> 00:57:39,158
Isn't that what you want?

903
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:41,130
To be with your daddy and Jesus?

904
00:57:41,234 --> 00:57:44,362
But, Mama, what about
Melanie and the babies?

905
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:46,803
Me and the babies, Mama.

906
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:50,808
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth
to have a thankless child"!

907
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:56,212
You get down on your knees
and pray for God's forgiveness!

908
00:57:58,218 --> 00:58:00,186
When you get done with that...

909
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:03,346
you take this,
come join your family up front.

910
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:06,682
Come on, come on.

911
00:58:15,268 --> 00:58:18,328
- Like a good Christian.
- Yeah.

912
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,217
They're trying to kill
the children, Daddy.

913
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:35,446
They're trying to kill us all, baby.

914
00:58:38,258 --> 00:58:40,283
I don't wanna live in this world no more.

915
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:43,758
I wanna go to Jesus.

916
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,267
Well, baby...

917
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:50,836
if you die...

918
00:58:52,272 --> 00:58:56,766
fighting an army
of sodomite-protecting idolaters...

919
00:58:56,876 --> 00:59:00,710
I suspect the good Lord's
gonna give you a mansion in his kingdom.

920
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:05,943
You always know what to say
to make me feel better, Daddy.

921
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:12,580
"Now learn ye the parable of a fig tree."

922
00:59:13,326 --> 00:59:14,793
Yes.

923
00:59:14,894 --> 00:59:17,362
Such as Matthew 24.

924
00:59:17,463 --> 00:59:19,795
"When his branch is yet tender..."

925
00:59:19,899 --> 00:59:21,298
and putteth forth leaves...

926
00:59:22,569 --> 00:59:24,298
"know that summer is nigh."

927
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:26,805
Well, baby...

928
00:59:28,675 --> 00:59:31,906
looks like summer's about as nigh
as it ever gonna get.

929
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,642
Let's go.

930
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:08,976
I shall see the face of the Lord...

931
01:00:09,082 --> 01:00:10,549
and the Lord's glory shall surely...

932
01:00:22,629 --> 01:00:24,893
You're gonna be quiet, okay?

933
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:26,659
I don't wanna shoot you, but I will.

934
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:30,364
Okay?

935
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:34,530
Okay.

936
01:00:43,216 --> 01:00:45,207
Are Travis and Billy-Ray dead?

937
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,992
So what? You gonna fucking kill me?

938
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,727
If you help me, I won't.

939
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:05,065
Else I will, I swear.

940
01:01:13,646 --> 01:01:15,978
There's government agents outside...

941
01:01:16,082 --> 01:01:18,448
and they wanna come in here
and kill my family.

942
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,178
- Fucking good!
- Will you shut up?

943
01:01:20,286 --> 01:01:22,379
I'm trying to save your life.

944
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:28,718
Those government people...
they're gonna kill you too.

945
01:01:28,828 --> 01:01:31,661
They already shot your friend...

946
01:01:31,764 --> 01:01:34,232
and they are gonna kill everyone
in this house...

947
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:36,733
'cause they screwed up
what they came here to do.

948
01:01:36,836 --> 01:01:40,795
They're gonna kill us
so that we can't tell on 'em.

949
01:01:42,108 --> 01:01:44,099
They don't want any witnesses...

950
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:48,977
so they're gonna bust in here
and shoot all of us...

951
01:01:49,082 --> 01:01:52,813
even my little brothers
and my sister and my cousins.

952
01:01:53,853 --> 01:01:56,413
But I can't let the babies get killed.

953
01:01:56,522 --> 01:01:58,615
I've done some bad things.

954
01:01:58,725 --> 01:02:02,024
But if I let them babies get killed...

955
01:02:06,733 --> 01:02:09,793
They don't know what
we've been up to in here.

956
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:14,202
If they did, they could just arrest us.

957
01:02:14,307 --> 01:02:16,172
They could put us on trial...

958
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:20,507
and then the Zionist media
would make heroes out of 'em.

959
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:23,081
But they are gonna need witnesses...

960
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:26,446
and that's you.

961
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:29,447
That's you.

962
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:34,815
So, if you and me...

963
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:38,693
we can get out there
without gettin' killed...

964
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:41,790
we can tell 'em
what's really goin' on in the chapel.

965
01:02:41,901 --> 01:02:45,098
We do that, and they can't
kill the babies.

966
01:02:56,182 --> 01:02:57,149
Sara, baby.

967
01:02:58,785 --> 01:03:00,446
Gimme some sweet tea, will you?

968
01:03:18,905 --> 01:03:20,896
- You want me to save your life?
- No, no.

969
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,976
You want me to save your life?

970
01:03:28,548 --> 01:03:30,413
You killed my fucking friends.

971
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:34,179
It's not me I care about
so much as I care about the kids.

972
01:03:35,755 --> 01:03:39,885
My cousin's kid ain't
but three years old and my little sis...

973
01:03:43,095 --> 01:03:46,155
My little sister's only eight.

974
01:03:56,075 --> 01:03:57,406
Fuck you.

975
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,877
You think they're gonna believe
that you weren't one of us?

976
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,007
They won't even give you the chance to
tell 'em before they put one in your head.

977
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:10,612
'Cause once they get inside here
that is exactly what they're gonna do.

978
01:04:12,491 --> 01:04:14,083
You think I give a shit?

979
01:04:18,197 --> 01:04:20,188
Fuck you...

980
01:04:20,299 --> 01:04:22,062
and your stupid family.

981
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:25,331
My two best friends are fucking dead.

982
01:04:25,438 --> 01:04:28,202
So you know what?
Why don't you just go on and kill me too?

983
01:04:28,307 --> 01:04:31,708
You can take that gun
and just fucking kill me too.

984
01:04:31,811 --> 01:04:33,472
Just put a bullet in my fucking head...

985
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:37,140
because that's what I've been waiting for
since you tied me to a fucking cross!

986
01:04:38,684 --> 01:04:40,345
Cheyenne!

987
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:43,154
Please.

988
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:46,391
Yeah, I bet Billy-Ray said please too.

989
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,151
And they still killed him.

990
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:52,894
So fuck you.

991
01:04:52,999 --> 01:04:55,126
And if you wanna save
your precious fucking babies...

992
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:57,759
why don't you suck a fucking rescue
outta my dick, bitch?

993
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:01,005
What?

994
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:03,132
You get away from her, you heathen!

995
01:05:03,242 --> 01:05:05,904
- Get the fuck off me!
- You!

996
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:08,446
Mama, please! Mama, stop it!

997
01:05:08,547 --> 01:05:11,573
- Mama, please! Mama!
- Get off!

998
01:05:13,419 --> 01:05:16,616
- You damn heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!

999
01:05:16,722 --> 01:05:18,485
What are you trying to do to her?

1000
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,458
Trying to get what you came for?
What did you do to my girl?

1001
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,686
Mama!

1002
01:05:24,196 --> 01:05:26,187
What's the matter with you, girl?

1003
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,625
What's got over you?

1004
01:05:29,735 --> 01:05:33,102
Will you put that gun down?
His friends killed your daddy.

1005
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:35,469
If we just confess,
they can't kill the babies.

1006
01:05:59,098 --> 01:06:01,032
No, don't go anywhere!

1007
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,910
There's men outside
and they aim to kill us.

1008
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,478
So you take everybody
up to the attic, okay?

1009
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:27,855
You barricade the door. Okay?

1010
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,552
What'd you do?

1011
01:06:29,662 --> 01:06:32,256
You do it!
You get 'em up there, goddamn it!

1012
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:35,163
- You do it right now!
- What did you do, Cheyenne?

1013
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:38,430
- Go!
- Mama!

1014
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:41,005
Mommy! Mommy!

1015
01:06:43,642 --> 01:06:45,234
Is Mama dead?

1016
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:50,815
Listen.

1017
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:57,650
You go on with Maggie
and the other kids upstairs now, okay?

1018
01:06:57,757 --> 01:07:01,955
You go up to the attic
and you stay there until I come get you.

1019
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:06,896
You don't open that door for nobody else
but me, okay? You understand?

1020
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:09,293
Okay, you go on now.

1021
01:07:09,402 --> 01:07:10,869
Quick, like a bunny.

1022
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,048
Stevie, go!

1023
01:07:30,656 --> 01:07:32,214
Go, go, go!

1024
01:07:44,403 --> 01:07:46,132
Cocksuckers!

1025
01:08:10,529 --> 01:08:11,791
Mordechai!

1026
01:08:11,897 --> 01:08:15,162
Top of the crown! Top of the crown!

1027
01:08:27,313 --> 01:08:29,042
The Lord is our shepherd.

1028
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:31,973
The Lord is my shepherd.

1029
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:03,747
Team, get ready to flank!

1030
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:29,101
No!

1031
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:05,209
- Freeze! Drop your weapon!
- Look, don't shoot. I'm a hostage, okay?

1032
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,542
- We need to talk to who's in charge.
- Drop the fucking gun!

1033
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,615
You don't have to do this.

1034
01:10:10,716 --> 01:10:11,978
Get back.

1035
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,609
There's enough evidence
to put us all away for life.

1036
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,153
- Don't move!
- Get back, all right?

1037
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,746
There's babies in the attic!

1038
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:23,028
No!

1039
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,166
You all right?

1040
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:43,106
What the fuck was that?

1041
01:11:04,737 --> 01:11:07,365
Yes, sir!

1042
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:11,204
Yes, sir! He's calling us home!

1043
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,834
Come on, come on!

1044
01:11:12,945 --> 01:11:16,437
Come on, children! Come on!

1045
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:23,513
Everywhere, everywhere

1046
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:26,680
Drop the artillery!

1047
01:11:50,316 --> 01:11:53,046
There be no need for that anymore.

1048
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:55,245
Where's that sound coming from?

1049
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:57,652
"And the four angels were loosed..."

1050
01:11:57,756 --> 01:12:01,783
which were prepared
for an hour and a day...

1051
01:12:01,894 --> 01:12:04,385
and a month and a year...

1052
01:12:04,496 --> 01:12:06,862
"to slay a third of men."

1053
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:11,062
Hear ye!

1054
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:14,105
His sacred call to arms!

1055
01:12:14,206 --> 01:12:17,698
The heavenly trumpets sound his name!

1056
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:20,438
The one true God comes to rapture!

1057
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:23,106
His faithful slay the wicked...

1058
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:27,549
and send this evil world straight to hell!

1059
01:12:29,655 --> 01:12:32,249
Enough! Enough, goddamn it! Enough!

1060
01:12:32,358 --> 01:12:34,622
Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute, everybody.

1061
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:39,923
No more fire and brimstone, preacher!

1062
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,195
What does that sound mean?

1063
01:12:43,302 --> 01:12:45,031
Well, boy...

1064
01:12:46,472 --> 01:12:50,738
there ain't nothing left
but fire and brimstone.

1065
01:12:51,343 --> 01:12:52,810
Can't you hear?

1066
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:54,902
Can't you hear?

1067
01:12:57,182 --> 01:13:00,242
This is the Lord's day of judgment.

1068
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,681
Four trumpet blasts.

1069
01:13:03,789 --> 01:13:05,814
The seals have been opened...

1070
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:08,586
and the horsemen dispatched.

1071
01:13:08,694 --> 01:13:10,662
Three more blasts...

1072
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:16,224
and he closes the book
on this wicked, wicked world!

1073
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:19,600
- Praise His name!
- Praise His name!

1074
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:21,229
So come on!

1075
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:24,141
Come on, G-man.

1076
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:26,942
"G" for "Godless."

1077
01:13:27,045 --> 01:13:29,104
"G" for "government."

1078
01:13:29,214 --> 01:13:30,909
Come on.

1079
01:13:31,016 --> 01:13:32,916
Come on. Shoot me.

1080
01:13:33,018 --> 01:13:35,452
Shoot me, you bootlicking...

1081
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:39,183
flag-worshipping heathen!

1082
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:43,352
Shoot me!
It only hastens my reward in eternity.

1083
01:13:43,462 --> 01:13:47,796
Shoot me! Shoot me!

1084
01:13:55,674 --> 01:13:58,165
And then what happened?

1085
01:13:58,277 --> 01:14:00,370
Special Agent Keenan?

1086
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,371
Special Agent Keenan?

1087
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:04,949
What happened?

1088
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:09,753
I subdued the suspect...

1089
01:14:09,855 --> 01:14:11,447
with a head butt.

1090
01:14:12,057 --> 01:14:15,720
- A head butt?
- Yes, sir. The suspect was standing...

1091
01:14:16,728 --> 01:14:18,855
unnaturally close.

1092
01:14:19,665 --> 01:14:24,068
And then the trumpet blast sounded
three more times, and a fourth and a fifth.

1093
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:26,603
By then it was pretty clear
the rapture wasn't going to happen.

1094
01:14:26,705 --> 01:14:30,835
So we rounded up
the remaining Five Pointers.

1095
01:14:30,943 --> 01:14:32,570
On the record, Agent Keenan...

1096
01:14:32,678 --> 01:14:35,078
this inquiry commends you
for peaceably containing...

1097
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,011
a potentially explosive situation.

1098
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:39,583
But, off the record...

1099
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:42,483
you disobeyed a direct order
from a superior, Joe.

1100
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:45,650
I did.

1101
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:49,989
And I have no excuse
that's gonna mean anything here.

1102
01:14:53,832 --> 01:14:55,561
Yeah. Yeah.

1103
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:12,844
Well, it is the finding of this inquiry...

1104
01:15:12,951 --> 01:15:15,010
that Special Agent
Joseph Keenan be relieved...

1105
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,588
as head of Field Office 263.

1106
01:15:17,689 --> 01:15:20,351
He's to be placed
on one-week leave without pay...

1107
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,256
after which time he'll report
to the Washington office...

1108
01:15:22,361 --> 01:15:24,761
for reassignment in the District.

1109
01:15:26,965 --> 01:15:28,432
I'm getting promoted?

1110
01:15:33,105 --> 01:15:34,663
You're still gonna kill him.

1111
01:15:34,773 --> 01:15:37,173
The United States government
doesn't kill people, Agent Keenan...

1112
01:15:37,276 --> 01:15:39,244
in or out of custody.

1113
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:47,347
Of course we're gonna kill him, Joe.

1114
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:48,919
We're gonna kill him with kindness.

1115
01:15:49,021 --> 01:15:52,218
- You're gonna let him go to trial?
- Oh, come on.

1116
01:15:52,324 --> 01:15:55,452
- What is this, September 10, 2001?
- Patriot Act, bitch.

1117
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:58,655
We can plant him forever, okay?
Without a trial.

1118
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:01,927
Never show him the light of day,
let alone a TV camera or a microphone.

1119
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,058
How...

1120
01:16:03,168 --> 01:16:05,398
What do you think
we've been doing the last 10 years?

1121
01:16:05,504 --> 01:16:08,496
Yeah. It's terrorism, Joe. Okay?

1122
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:12,338
If you kill an American because of a
religious belief, you are a terrorist...

1123
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:14,742
and terrorists get locked the fuck up.

1124
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:17,940
If it's all so easy
to put these people away for life...

1125
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,847
why was I given those orders?

1126
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:23,578
Truth?

1127
01:16:25,223 --> 01:16:27,691
- 'Cause fuck people like this.
- They're animals.

1128
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:29,420
I mean, don't get me wrong. Jesus saves.

1129
01:16:29,528 --> 01:16:33,191
He ain't gonna save Abin Cooper
from a fuck-load of prison rape.

1130
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:36,267
Daily shtuppings by Coke-can cocks.

1131
01:16:36,368 --> 01:16:38,097
Savor that irony, Joe.

1132
01:16:41,907 --> 01:16:43,374
Hey, what was it?

1133
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,242
- The trumpet blast.
- Pardon?

1134
01:16:47,346 --> 01:16:50,042
The trumpet blast... What was it really?

1135
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,048
Oh, that.

1136
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,640
Some new neighbors...

1137
01:16:53,752 --> 01:16:57,449
these eco kids from the university
with a compost collective...

1138
01:16:57,556 --> 01:17:02,550
they got an acre off the ass end of the Five
Point property, other side of the hill.

1139
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:05,858
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff
because of the smell of the compost.

1140
01:17:05,964 --> 01:17:08,956
- Was it bad?
- Gets so you can taste it.

1141
01:17:10,035 --> 01:17:12,560
But Abin's been harassing these kids...

1142
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:14,468
sending some of his bigger boys over...

1143
01:17:14,573 --> 01:17:16,473
to bitch at first...

1144
01:17:16,575 --> 01:17:18,668
maybe break a window or two.

1145
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:20,608
Then I guess they went old-school...

1146
01:17:20,712 --> 01:17:24,910
Lots of sugar in gas tanks,
burning bags of dog shit.

1147
01:17:25,017 --> 01:17:27,645
- College kids.
- No, that was Cooper and his church.

1148
01:17:27,753 --> 01:17:30,688
The eco kids never so much
as called the cops.

1149
01:17:30,789 --> 01:17:32,347
They...

1150
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,426
They got creative instead.

1151
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:39,327
They thought it'd be funny
to take a page out of Revelations...

1152
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:42,423
and get Cooper and his family's hopes up
with the trumpets.

1153
01:17:43,735 --> 01:17:49,230
So they got this big-ass,
rusty old siren...

1154
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:51,935
from a firehouse that just got a new one.

1155
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:56,845
The fire chief said they could have the
damn thing as long as they carted it off.

1156
01:17:56,948 --> 01:17:58,711
It's big as a Mini Cooper.

1157
01:17:58,817 --> 01:18:01,911
So they truck this thing down
to their compost collective...

1158
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:05,786
they put it in a barn,
they hook it up to an iPod of all things...

1159
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:08,359
and they played these
single-note trumpet blasts...

1160
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,291
that they pulled off the Internet.

1161
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,727
And they had no idea
that you were even there.

1162
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,767
It was just dumb luck.

1163
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:27,109
Oh, those eco kids
with the compost collective?

1164
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,905
Turns out it was a cover
for a marijuana grow-house.

1165
01:18:31,016 --> 01:18:32,916
They're being booked right now.

1166
01:18:33,018 --> 01:18:35,486
But considering how
they probably saved a bunch more lives...

1167
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:37,384
Yeah, yeah. I'll write a letter.

1168
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:39,814
Yeah.

1169
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,259
Hey, Joe.

1170
01:18:44,496 --> 01:18:46,293
Really...

1171
01:18:46,398 --> 01:18:48,332
why did you shine the direct?

1172
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:58,004
My grandma on my mother's side...

1173
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:01,773
she had these two dogs,
pure bloodhounds...

1174
01:19:03,215 --> 01:19:05,206
both came up the same litter.

1175
01:19:05,317 --> 01:19:10,414
She kept them
and gave the rest away to the neighbors.

1176
01:19:10,522 --> 01:19:13,980
Both known each other
since they had shit in their eyes.

1177
01:19:14,092 --> 01:19:17,653
Neither one ever treated any better
than the other one.

1178
01:19:17,763 --> 01:19:20,254
Gentlest dogs you'd ever care to meet.

1179
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,163
So anyway...

1180
01:19:24,269 --> 01:19:27,636
Thanksgiving of my ninth year, these
two old dogs are trailing me around...

1181
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:32,802
'cause they know the score... I'm a
animal lover who never finishes his supper.

1182
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:35,402
So right before I get up from the table...

1183
01:19:35,514 --> 01:19:38,642
I toss these two old-timers
a turkey leg...

1184
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,615
attached to a hunk of cartilage.

1185
01:19:43,255 --> 01:19:45,780
And it was like they'd never met.

1186
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:48,155
They went at each other so ferociously...

1187
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:52,094
all tooth and claw and jugular...

1188
01:19:52,197 --> 01:19:54,825
They forgot anything
they ever had in common...

1189
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:59,393
and scrapped like that discard
decided between their standing and dying.

1190
01:20:06,812 --> 01:20:10,748
People just do the strangest things
when they believe they're entitled.

1191
01:20:14,152 --> 01:20:17,610
But they do even stranger things
when they just plain believe.

1192
01:20:19,157 --> 01:20:21,853
I see the face of Jesus

1193
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,054
On my way tonight

1194
01:20:29,434 --> 01:20:34,838
He says to me
Old sinner, come on in

1195
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:41,001
I see the face of Jesus

1196
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:45,081
In that great white light

1197
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,821
And my savior
makes me whole again

1198
01:20:54,826 --> 01:20:57,795
In his shining eyes...

1199
01:20:59,464 --> 01:21:02,024
In his shining eyes...

1200
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:05,066
I see the promise...

1201
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:10,208
of all forgiveness that sets you free.

1202
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,810
I see the face of Jesus...

1203
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:17,682
on my way this night.

1204
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:27,018
And my savior's light to comfort me

1205
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:28,888
Shut the fuck up!
