1
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,586
What are you gonna do this weekend?

2
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,794
- I don't know. What are you doing?
- It's none of your business. 

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,878
Did you finish that thing for your Lit class?

4
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,057
No. It's due in like two weeks or something.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,304
Oh, sweet Jesus in the morning.

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,602
Again with these people?

7
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,860
He's burnin' in hell!

8
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,175
Because, if what the framers of our constitution mean-

9
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,303
What, Travis? Fifteen minutes?

10
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,730
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

11
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,728
Where you been?

12
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,105
I was dropping my grandma off at the airport...

13
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,189
and on the way back the Five-Pointers blocked up Lennox Hill.

14
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,821
Oh, so Abin Cooper's after you too now?

15
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,243
Yeah, and I ain't even gay.

16
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,742
Nah, you're not gay. You're just curious.

17
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,869


18
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,450
What?

19
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,001
All right, all right, all right.

20
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:02,957
So every once in a while we add amendments to the Constitution...

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,716
which Abin Cooper practiced this morning on Lennox, making Travis late.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,296
Like the First Amendment-

23
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,929
which Abin Cooper practiced this morning on Lennox, making Travis late.

24
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,806
Those people are such assholes.

25
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,435
Okay. I'm gonna let that ride because this is a passionate issue...

26
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,857
and because, yes, they are assholes.

27
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,985
Wait. Who's Abin Cooper?

28
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,484
He's that creepy church guy...

29
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,316
that's always saying how God's all pissed off at everybody.

30
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,901
Yeah, him and his family are the ones...

31
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,282
that are always holding up signs outside of funerals and stuff.

32
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,490
This was they were protesting the funeral...

33
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,745
of the gay kid who got killed two weeks ago.

34
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,326
Yeah. Jacob Harlow.

35
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,377
He went here.
I didn't teach him, but he went here.

36
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,955
It was all over the news, right?

37
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,132
Jessie, I am both happy and sad...

38
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,302
that you don't know who Abin Cooper is...

39
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,254
but, I mean, come on.

40
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,964
Abin Cooper and the Five Points Trinity Church...

41
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,924
they're like right in our own backyard.

42
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,726
Come on, Mrs. Vasquez, Cooper's Dell is like 30 minutes away.

43
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,770
Yeah. Too close.

44
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,689
Abin Cooper holds our entire state up for ridicule.

45
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,484
All right?
Ultraconservatives avoid this guy.

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,157
Did you know last year the head of the largest neo-Nazi faction in this country...

47
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,951
issued a statement distancing his politics...

48
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,996
from Cooper's and Five Points'?

49
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,075
Even the Nazis think this guy is “nuckin' futs."

50
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:24,338
All right, let's just hope that the Cooper clan sticks with the First Amendment-

51
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,963
- Why?
- and stays away from the Second Amendment.

52
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,263
- What is the Second Amendment?
- We get guns.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,428
What is this, man?

54
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,355
It's like Craigslist for people who want to get fucked.

55
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,934
I thought Craigslist was Craigslist for people who want to get fucked.

56
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,610
What kinda dirty shit you lookin' at, boy?

57
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,157
Fuck, faggot!

58
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,989
Touch my dick again and see what happens.

59
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,160
- Such an animal.
- They're all the same, man.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,537
- You can't see any faces.
- Oh, shit. You showin' him?

61
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,835
Dude, get your fuckin' flappers outta here.

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,753
Yeah, look, it doesn't matter.
You can see the tits.

63
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,797
You can see the fuckin' pussy, man.
Fuck the faces.

64
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,672
How we know we wanna fuck the face unless we can see what they look like?

65
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,504
- Right, thank you.
- You fuckin' bag their head, man. All right?

66
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,260
Look, these bitches wanna fuck.

67
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,591
Even if they do wanna fuck, they're all in New York and LA.

68
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,142
Lots more in LA Look-

69
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,219
New York. LA.

70
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,646
- Road trip.
- LA.

71
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,723
- LA-
- I get the point, all right, but look.

72
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,479
This one's a little closer to home.

73
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,105
Holy shit! Cooper's Dell?

74
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,440
- Let me see.
- No fuckin' way!

75
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,240
We're gettin' laid, boys.

76
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,318
How do we know she's gonna fuck us, or even one of us?

77
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,529
I've been talking back and forth with one for two weeks now.

78
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,239
She says she's interested.

79
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,790
Fuckin'-

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,788
I just got a little hard.

81
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,461
I don't wanna fuckin' fuck some chick that he just stuck his dick in.

82
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,164
- Look, look-
- His greasy-assed fuckin' dick.

83
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,749
It's not greasy.

84
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,051
There ain't gonna be no sloppy seconds, boy, okay?

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,222
She wants to fuck all three of us at the same time.

86
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,676
- Jesus Christ.
- I call the ass.

87
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,511
You're not gettin' the fuckin' ass.

88
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,848
What if this turns out to be one of them ‘Catch a Predator’ deals?

89
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,433
Who we preyin' on?

90
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,895
We're the fuckin' minors here.
She's the one who says she's 38.

91
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,231
Jesus. It's gonna be like fucking my mom.

92
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,241
I ain't sure it ain't your mom, motherfucker.

93
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,411
- Fuck you.
- I don't think I should go, man.

94
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,618
I'm having some doubts over here.

95
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,198
Oh, you're going.

96
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,160
You don't think the three of us balling this woman in the same room...

97
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,995
is a little faggoty?

98
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,957
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't be so fuckin' middle-class.

99
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,089
This was the scene this morning outside the funeral of Jacob Harlow...

100
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,921
No, no, no. Hey, we're gonna be on TV in a minute. Watch.

101
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,634
This was the scene this morning outside the funeral of Jacob Harlow...

102
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,844
The 19 year-old whose body was found last week...

103
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,431
in a Dumpster behind a well-known gay bar on Slattery Drive...

104
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,687
bound head-to-toe in plastic wrap.

105
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,565
Harlow the latest victim in a rash of hate crimes...

106
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,362
- This is Caterine Carlyle-
- Oh, oh, oh! There we are.

107
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,613
Pastor Abin Cooper and the members of his Five Points Trinity Church...

108
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:03,289
staged their 432nd funeral demonstration since 2001.

109
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,331
- This is Caterine Carlyle-
- Oh, oh, oh! There we are.

110
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,250
There we are.

111
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,750
- I'm sleeping with a TV star tonight.
- Yeah, you are.

112
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,376
How'd you know we were gonna be on there?

113
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,004
Barbara called me.
She saw it on the 5:00 news.

114
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,506
So you gonna tell your friends we're famous?

115
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,884
- Probably not.
- Smart ass.

116
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,681
Where you off to tonight?

117
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,760
I don't know. Just gonna drive around with Jarod and Billy-Ray.

118
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,845
Probably go see a movie or something.

119
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,976
Fill up the tank before you bring it back.

120
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,059
- Can I get some money for gas?
- No.

121
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,815
Later.

122
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,911
So how are we gonna do this?

123
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,297
How do you mean?

124
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,500
Talkin' about how are you gonna get under us.

125
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,213
- What are you talking about?
- Me and the lady.

126
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,047
You fuckin'-

127
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,760
This is what happens when fuckin' parents block porn sites, man.

128
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,720
They make socially backwards kids.

129
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,352
How about you just pull over and let me out.

130
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,354
Come on, man. You're being-
Oh, fuck!

131
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,611
- You hit it.
- Fuck.

132
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,191
You fuckin' hit it.

133
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,694
Why the fuck are we gettin' out?

134
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,203
It's so fuckin' dark out no one could see us if they were looking.

135
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,081
Holy shit! Look at your fuckin' car.

136
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,834
Your fuckin' car!

137
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,132
- Are you kidding me?
- Holy shit, man.

138
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,926
Dude, that's, like, a lot of... damage.

139
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,129
That sucks, man.

140
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46,308
Who the fuck parks their car on the side of the road like that?

141
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,851
You think there's somebody in there?

142
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,803
I don't know, man. Nobody's here.

143
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,604
Why the fuck did you stop?

144
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,024
Oh, fuck. You got 'em real good.

145
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,230
- Holy fuck!
- Fuck!

146
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,687
- Fuck!
- Get in the car! Get in the car!

147
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,160
They ain't following us.

148
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,240
Why in the fuck was that guy on the side of the road?

149
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,791
Who cares, man?
Let's just keep fuckin' going.

150
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,585
- My car's fucked up, man!
- Well, guess what.

151
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,914
Your car's gonna be fucked up when you get home too.

152
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,544
So why don't we just keep going?

153
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,250
We're in Cooper's Dell already.

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,335
We'll hate ourselves tomorrow if we don't do this.

155
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,844
- I'm not gonna hate myself.
- I'm gonna hate not getting that pussy...

156
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,926
so let's not take this little fender-bender as a bad omen, boys.

157
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,728
Let's fucking do this!

158
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,816
Lasso me some pussy!

159
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,197
She lives in a trailer?

160
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,530
You live in a trailer, motherfucker.

161
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,953
I was just askin'. Damn.

162
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,640
You Jarod?

163
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,649
This here is Travis, and that's Billy-Ray.

164
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,995
I bet you boys wanna get up to the devil's business, don't you?

165
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,124
Well, devil's right in here.

166
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,591
You look lovely.

167
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,020
How 'bout a beer, boys?

168
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,964
Hey Pete. Can you believe it?
I got sideswiped tonight.

169
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,544
- You get 'em?
- No.

170
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,473
I was parked and they kept movin'.

171
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,226
Why were you parked?

172
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:41,775
Oh, I was makin' a reservation for Helen, tomorrow night for our 19th.

173
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,978
I'm thinking about taking Darla someplace special...

174
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,279
for our fifth next month.

175
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,982
Someplace overseas, you know?

176
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,239
Like maybe Italy.

177
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,320
Soon as I win enough off these doggies.

178
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,750
Well, win enough to do this damn body work on my car, would ya?

179
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,912
Dumb-ass kids.

180
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,002
How you know they was kids?

181
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,755
I don't know.
They was in some kind of Mom-mobile.

182
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,884
Suppose that's mighty keen detecting skills there, Sheriff.

183
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,715
Yeah, well-

184
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,598
I'm gonna need you to go out there and end 'em.

185
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,769
You kiddin' me?
I'm off the clock 10 minutes now.

186
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,192
The only reason I'm still here is 'cause you're so damn late.

187
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,692
Jesus Christ. Just go out and find the damn car, will ya?

188
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,990
It's a blue Volvo station wagon.

189
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,126
Geez.

190
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,671
This is nice.

191
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,009
You boys finished your beers yet?

192
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,312
- I'm workin' on it.
- Almost. Almost.

193
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,188
Takes me a few beers to work up to the sex.

194
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,652
So get drinkin', 'cause I ain't drinkin' alone.

195
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,579
And I don't let no man in me unless he's got at least two beers in him.

196
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,280
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,865
Makes sense.

198
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,708
This is nice.

199
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,506
Will you close your fuckin' legs?

200
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,799
It's like a shag.

201
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,054
So how's about you head back into the bedroom...

202
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,141
start strippin' down so we can get this thing started.

203
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,936
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,695
Almost don't even Ht in here.

205
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,828
Get them beers drunk.

206
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,124
This bitch wants my dick, don't she?

207
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,331
She is a lot better looking.

208
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,839
Them tits ain't nothin' to write home about.

209
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,589
Those tits are-

210
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,839
Fuck!

211
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,721
What the fuck?

212
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,897
Fuckin' roofies.

213
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,799
Hello?

214
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,263
Guys?

215
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,895
Is that you, Travis? Billy-Ray?

216
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,446
The emblem of suffering-

217
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,363
All right, guys, come on.
Seriously, let me outta here.

218
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,943
Can you just let me outta here, please?

219
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,405
The emblem of suffering-

220
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,742
Guys, this isn't fuckin' funny, all right?
Will you let me outta here, please!

221
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,786
What the fuck is going on?

222
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,213
Let me the fuck outta here, please, all right?

223
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,757
This isn't funny anymore.

224
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,506
This isn't fuckin' funny anymore.
This isn't funny anymore, man.

225
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,758
Come on, let me the fuck out!

226
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,555
I swear to God, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

227
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,053
Let me out!

228
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,432
If you guys don't let me the fuck outta here, I'm gonna kill you!

229
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,934
I will cherish

230
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,063
The old rugged cross

231
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,071
Will you find somebody to...

232
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,990
Can somebody please let me outta here?
Please?

233
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,160
- Lucas, sit down.
- Fuckin' bitch.

234
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,737
Hey, you fuckin' bitch!

235
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,993
Let me the fuck outta here, you fuckin' bitch!

236
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,166
The old rugged cross

237
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,743
Fuck!

238
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:15,920
And exchange it someday

239
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:20,925
For a crown

240
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,009
Well, how about that?

241
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,263
That was lovely.

242
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,143
Just lovely.

243
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,772
Y'all give that Mormon Tabernacle Choir a run for their money.

244
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,526
You know what this is?

245
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,525
That's a printout of what we done today.

246
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,736
That's an article that appears in tomorrow's Post.

247
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,662
You know what that's called?

248
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,492
National coverage.

249
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,749
- Sure was.
- Indeed, it was.

250
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,255
Abigail...

251
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,549
TiVo'd the segment on the 5:00 news.

252
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,715
Y'all can watch it later if you want to-

253
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,217
and see yourselves on the TV.

254
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,887
Yeah, tell you what we gonna do next week.

255
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,472
We gonna paint the garage.

256
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,557
I know how you love that, but we gonna paint.

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,392
Someone, please!
Come on, please!

258
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,854
I need big, strong volunteers.
How about you?

259
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,199
How about you? You big and strong?

260
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,870
RJ?

261
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,118
Show me how Popeye do.

262
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,623
Popeye!

263
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,330
Yeah, oh, wow! Don't hurt me, Popeye.

264
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,336
Oh, Popeye, don't hurt me.

265
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,419
Will somebody please let me the fuck outta here!

266
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,052
Caleb, come on, now.
That's a bit much. Now, come on, come on.

267
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,472
No! Fuck! Fuck!

268
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,524
- Welcome, family.
- Good evenin'.

269
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,905
- Good evenin', Granddaddy.
- Good evenin', Grandpa.

270
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,657
Good evening.

271
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,907
But what's so good about it?

272
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,334
Psalms 117,verse 24.

273
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,255
“This is the day which the Lord hath made.

274
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,800
We will rejoice and be glad in it.”

275
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,502
Glad in it.

276
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,963
“Oh, woe is me if I preach not the gospels.”

277
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,925
Corinthians 9:16.

278
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,429
Amen, Grandpa.

279
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,348
Oh, well, I think I'm gonna preach that holy word.

280
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,898
- Preach it, Daddy.
- Yes.

281
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,978
We read in Hebrews 11-

282
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,198
By faith- by faith-

283
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:50,404
Noah, being warned by God of things not seen as yet...

284
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,198
prepared an ark...

285
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,626
for the savin' of his house...

286
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,453
by which he condemned all others.

287
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,039
For there was multitudes upon multitudes of people...

288
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,591
and God drowned them all except Noah and his flock.

289
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,260
Drowned them all.
All sinners gone to hell.

290
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,803
Praise his name.

291
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:12,008
I'm good at climbing.
I'm good at climbing.

292
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:19,270
You talk to some of them maudlin, touchy-feely preachers out there...

293
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,022
peddlin' their soft faith...

294
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,853
they gonna tell you what you wanna hear.

295
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,402
They ain't gonna tell you what you need to know.

296
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,904
They can't. Can't tell you the truth.

297
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,364
this nation and the world is goin' to hell.

298
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,999
But they'll tell you...

299
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,543
this nation and the world is goin' to hell.

300
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,498
They won't tell you why.
Can't tell you why.

301
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,132
They'll tell you...

302
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,175
“God loves you.

303
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,963
God loves everybody.”

304
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,477
Does a God that drowned the entire world, exception of Noah and his flock...

305
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,931
sound like a God that loves you?

306
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:00,981
No.

307
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,651
That sound like a God that forgives your sins?

308
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,228
- No!
- No, sir.

309
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,188
Your carnal desires?

310
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,399
That's not God's love.

311
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,577
That's a God that abhors the wicked.

312
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,622
He abhors those that ignore his righteous teaching...

313
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,040
and forsake his covenant...

314
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,914
and scoff at his acts.

315
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,588
God doesn't love you...

316
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,170
unless you fear him.

317
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,671
We talk about a fear we have of certain snakes.

318
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,384
Well, that'd be a righteous fear.

319
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,595
We talkin' about a fear we have of takin' a cookie...

320
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,851
Grandma's cookie jar...

321
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,773
afraid of being caught?

322
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,234
I don't believe so.

323
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,155
Talkin' about the fear of God. I fear God.

324
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,483
You better believe I fear God.

325
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,320
But my fear is born out of respect-

326
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,371
- Oh, fuck.
- admiration...

327
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,323
devotion...

328
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,250
sacrifice...

329
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,915
adoration...

330
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,966
and knowledge of the scripture...

331
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,588
that I preach.

332
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,512
Give us some knowledge, Daddy.
Give us some knowledge.

333
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,136
But I preach knowledge, and I preach to this...

334
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,015
and I preach, and I preach-

335
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,480
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.

336
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,606
I preach like my daddy before me, and his daddy before him.

337
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,148
My granddaddy built this church goin' on a hundred years ago.

338
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,029
He used to minister up there...

339
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:38,284
at the 12th St. Baptist up there in the city...

340
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:44,164
till he couldn't stomach what he called the deviltry any more.

341
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,123
So he abandoned that modern-day Gomorrah and settled Cooper's Dell...

342
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,049
June, 1917.

343
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,717
But if he thought people were depraved back then-

344
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,095
I mean, his head had nearly burst...

345
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,019
if he saw how wicked this country's become.

346
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,096
I hate the wickedness of America...

347
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,687
and all the sin-worshippers who populate it.

348
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,520
“Do I not hate them, O Lord, that hate thee?"

349
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,196
Says in Psalms 138...

350
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,899
“Am I not grieved by those that rise up against thee?

351
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,986
I hate them with a perfect hatred.

352
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,077
I count them mine enemies.”

353
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,954
Twenty-one, 22.

354
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,334
And who's the greatest enemy of God, Cheyenne?

355
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,414
- Satan.
- Satan.

356
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,092
- That's right, baby.
- Satan.

357
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,171
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,178
And who's Satan's instrument on earth, Fiona May?

359
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,679
The homosexuals.

360
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,434
That's right, baby. The homosexuals.

361
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,771
The homosexuals have run amok in this nation over 30 years now.

362
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,696
Let's see what it's brought us.

363
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,984
Rampant fornication...

364
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,569
adultery...

365
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,529
abortion...

366
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,489
flagrant sexuality...

367
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,167
in every corner of media, movies, TV, etc.

368
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,746
Schools, malls, books...

369
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,879
clothes, toys, music-

370
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,710
Everywhere.

371
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,636
You can't turn on the TV without seeing some jackass wavin' his privates.

372
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:22,217
You can't turn on the TV without seeing some jackass wavin' his privates.

373
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,350
That's because the moral spine of this country has been weakened...

374
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,773
by permissive attitudes...

375
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,570
and an unabashed tolerance for homosexuals.

376
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,646
Godlessness.

377
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,116
Godlessness.

378
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,446
The casual acceptance of the gay...

379
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,406
has hastened our demise as a species.

380
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,369
Fact. Why? Because they do not procreate.

381
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,795
They do not procreate.

382
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:56,001
Now, they solicit. Yeah, boy.

383
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,585
They recruit.

384
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,170
Yeah, boy.

385
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,885
But they do not procreate.

386
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,137
Is there anyone...

387
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,639
anyone... who can look at the news...

388
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,815
and deny these are our end times?

389
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,815
Outside our fence lays a world at waste.

390
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,315
There is famine, such as in Africa...

391
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,402
pestilence, such as the gay AIDS.

392
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:29,493
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes and the ensuing floods, such as New Orleans...

393
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,124
New Orleans is number one sin city.

394
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,671
Thailand- Thailand!

395
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,004
Thailand...

396
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,338
where pederasts travel thousands of miles...

397
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,095
A baby.

398
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,718
to sodomize a child.

399
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,689
A baby.

400
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,107
Thousands upon thousands dead in that tsunami.

401
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,661
I never saw the hand of God so clearly in all my born days.

402
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,661
And the Lord's bore witness to this apostasy.

403
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,954
Apostasy- The leaving of faith, the denying of religion...

404
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,038
denying of morality.

405
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,125
He's done with it.

406
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,752
He's done with it.

407
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,843
The end is nigh.

408
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,924
- The end is nigh.
- Yes, it is.

409
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,018
Cheyenne, bunny rabbit...

410
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,646
do you mind taking the children out now for the lesson...

411
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,901
'cause it's gonna get grown up in here.

412
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,616
You ready?

413
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,944
Come on, babies. Grandpa loves you.

414
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,528
Come on.

415
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,784
Gimme your hand there. Come on.

416
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,991
Come here. Come on, sweetie.

417
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,497
When you get finished today in school...

418
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,749
I want you to tell me all about it, will ya?

419
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,672
Will you tell me about it later?

420
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,255
I wish you'd talk to me sometime.

421
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,974
Would y'all like to see who we have to thank...

422
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,027
for the extinction of the human race?

423
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,568
It.

424
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,569
Y'all know about that Worldwide Web.

425
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,698
Yeah, that's the devil's playground.

426
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,159
We harnessed the devils' technology...

427
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,416
went out like sheep amongst wolves...

428
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,795
into them homosexually oriented chat rooms...

429
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,758
and we promised them boys what they wanted to hear.

430
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,298
Just like an insect...

431
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,978
just like moths to a flame, like flies to horseshit.

432
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,981
Insects. Insects...

433
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,106
that are easily trapped in that snare of God...

434
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,108
on that there Web.

435
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,817
And we gonna deal with 'em the way God taught us to deal with 'em...

436
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,823
the way we dealt with little Jacob Harlow...

437
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,576
who burns in hell as we speak.

438
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,326
Now...

439
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,290
there's a commandment talks against killin', isn't it?

440
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,421
There's a commandment speaks against killin'.

441
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,469
God's talking about your fellow man.

442
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,138
He's not talking about this... insect.

443
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:34,185
I mean, you don't mourn the death of a germ when it's been cured.

444
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,016
And a homosexual...

445
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,440
won't stop sinnin' of its own volition...

446
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:44,146
and it's up to the righteous to curb the spread of its disease.

447
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,357
“If a man also lie with mankind...

448
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,237
as he lies with a woman...

449
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,614
they both have committed an abomination...

450
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,822
and they shall surely be put to death.”

451
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,535
- That is the scripture.
- No. No!

452
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,712
That is scripture.

453
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,174
Well, the wrath of God...

454
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,046
is revealed from heaven...

455
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,342
against all ungodliness.

456
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,268
No! Please, help!

457
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,846
Help!

458
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,066
Now tape him up good, boys.
Now you watch that gay saliva.

459
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,864
If it gets on ya, it can turn ya.

460
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,909
Don't get it near his orifices, now.

461
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,410
- Shut up!
- Send the sinner straight to hell.

462
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,368
Come on, baby.
Send the sinner straight to hell.

463
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,793
Shut your mouth!

464
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,256
Send him off wrapped like a package.

465
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,389
Come on, Caleb.

466
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,325
Burn in hell, cocksucker.

467
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,745
No!

468
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,117
Caleb, head hole.

469
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,628
Let us out of here!
We didn't do anything!

470
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,505
Let us the fuck out of here!

471
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,086
Oh, man!

472
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,797
Let us out! Let us out of here, please!

473
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,640
All right. Get that other one.

474
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,059
Oh, fuck.

475
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,353
Oh, God. I ain't gay! Please!

476
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,226
Don't! No! No!

477
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,148
No, look, I ain't even gay!

478
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,942
Please, no! No!

479
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,145
Please! I ain't even gay!

480
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,981
I ain't even gay. I ain't even gay!

481
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,532
Please!

482
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,826
Stop. I ain't even gay! Please!

483
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,494
Let me go! Please!

484
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,993
- Jarod!
- Travis! Billy-Ray!

485
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:05,704
What the fuck are you doing? God!

486
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,255
- Take it easy, kid.
- I ain't even gay! I ain't even gay!

487
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,923
You might be worse.

488
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:14,629
Came to these woods to share a woman with other men in the same bed.

489
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,805
Will somebody please fuckin' help me!

490
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,728
Fornicatin' ways, they caused the destruction of both Sodom and Gomorrah.

491
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,305
I don't wanna die!

492
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,106
You already did, sinner.

493
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,275
You destroyed your spirit...

494
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,899
in a waste of shame.

495
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,184
Hey, Billy-Ray.

496
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,354
Fuck.

497
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,056
Hey, Billy-Ray.

498
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,573
They gonna do us like they did that guy.

499
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,446
Not if we can get outta here first, man.

500
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,620
- They gonna kill us!
- Listen. Listen to me.

501
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,995
I think a bone snapped out of this dead guy's skin when they dropped him...

502
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,792
because I feel something stabbing my leg.

503
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,462
What the fuck, man? What the fuck?

504
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,711
I think I can fuckin' tear through this paper...

505
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,542
if you can just fuckin' lean back a little bit.

506
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,377
Just work with me here a little bit.

507
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,963
Just tell me what I gotta do.

508
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,220
Lean back a little bit so I can lean forward. Just work with me.

509
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,097
Oh, no. No.

510
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,894
Really, no. Fuckin' lean into me, man.

511
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,846
Do you wanna fuckin' die?
Do you wanna fuckin' die?

512
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,023
Then fuckin' listen to me and we'll go home, all right?

513
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,521
Stop being a fuckin' baby and let's fucking get outta here, man.

514
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,945
Just lean back a little bit.

515
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,522
All right?

516
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:01,452
Just relax and lean back just a little bit so I can lean forward.

517
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,245
If I can get the bone on the thing...

518
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,914
just can't see straight.

519
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,662
Hurry, Trav.

520
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,078
It's only tape, man.

521
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:15,007
I just want my mom.
I really want my mom.

522
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,478
Oh, you can't do it.

523
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,732
Electronic gate.
It's got one of them magnetic locks on it.

524
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,277
- That's why I couldn't-
- Yeah.

525
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,279
I'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor.

526
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,985
That's all right.

527
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,618
You're a man of the law.
What can I do for you, Officer?

528
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,869
I'm following up on a report of a traffic accident.

529
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,419
Station wagon sideswiped a car out on Route 9.

530
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,168
Oh, my Lord. Anybody hurt?

531
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,672
No, sir. There was no one in the car at the time...

532
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,430
but I see you got a wagon over there with some damage...

533
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,974
that matches the description.

534
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,014
Fuck!

535
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,596
Oh, fuck. I'm free. I'm free.

536
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm free.

537
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,354
- I tell 'em and I tell 'em and I tell 'em.
- Sir?

538
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,735
That's my granddaughters'.

539
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:23,988
Once in a while they go into town, you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.

540
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,788
Whatever. I believe they're your culprits.

541
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,412
You know, it's not politically correct to say...

542
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,709
but women and cars...

543
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,245
Not a good mix.

544
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,759
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- Oh, fuck!

545
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,557
Go.

546
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,857
Go, man! Hurry!

547
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,361
It's too fuckin' tight, Trav.

548
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,188
I can't fuckin' do it. It's too tight.

549
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,273
Billy-Ray! Where are you goin'?

550
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,859
Billy-Ray, don't fuckin' go.
Where the fuck are you goin'?

551
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,444
I can't fuckin' do it!

552
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,160
I'm sorry!

553
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,287
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:17,087
If I could, I'd like to keep them insurance devils out of it.

555
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,540
You know, rates are high as it is...

556
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,093
and I'm not exactly Mr. Popularity around here.

557
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,129
Well, no, I guess not.

558
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,806
So if you can put me in touch with whoever it is, you know...

559
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,351
that owns the car that they scraped up...

560
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,053
why I can talk to 'em personal.

561
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,015
Maybe get him some financial restitution.

562
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,771
Make up for it, you know.

563
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,811
I mean, if you could.

564
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,982
I mean, there's only cosmetic damage, you know. 
Nobody was hurt.

565
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,626
I guess that'd be fine.
I'll just phone it in to y'all in the morning.

566
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,671
I thank you so much for that.
I'm much obliged.

567
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,589
- Hey, you have a good night.
- You too.

568
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,666
Oh, fuck!

569
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,098
Pastor, excuse me.

570
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,267
Sorry. I got one last thing.

571
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,101
I remember you went over to the Vatican to protest that dead pope's funeral...

572
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,977
a few years back.

573
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,855
And I guess what I'm saying is...

574
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,646
is Italy nice?

575
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,168
Oh, my God.

576
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,714
- Italy?
- Yeah.

577
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,418
I was thinking about taking my wife someplace exotic for our Eve-year...

578
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,971
and, well, Italy was at the top of the list.

579
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,050
Well, it's full of Italians.
There is that.

580
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,349
Full of Italians, huh?

581
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,430
Yeah, I suppose that stands to reason.

582
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,141
- All right, you have a good night.
- Thank you.

583
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,519
Oh, fuck.

584
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,029
Let's fuckin' do this!

585
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,255
Motherfucker.

586
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,841
Sheriff, I got shots fired inside of Five Points. 
Repeat. I have-

587
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,425
Shots fired

588
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,352
Repeat, shots fired inside of Five Points.

589
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,523
Wait a minute. In Cooper's church?

590
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,225
Immediate backup requested.

591
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,936
- Repeat, immediate backup requested.
- I got him, Daddy.

592
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,771
Jesus.

593
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,442
Pete!

594
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,527
Was that a gunshot, Pete?

595
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,454
Pete, you still there?

596
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,158
Pete!

597
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,212
Is this that obese queer, likes to sodomise wetbacks out on Route 9?

598
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,428
Who is this? Where's my deputy?

599
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,257
Yeah, God sees all, Mr. Queer.

600
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,593
God takes pictures too...

601
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,099
unseemly photographs of men on men-

602
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,523
backwards, sweaty lust-filled carnal knowledge.

603
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,898
That fun for you, Mr. Queer...

604
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,822
have a man in your mouth not a mile from my house of worship?

605
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,152
Now there was some unpleasantness out here tonight.

606
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,862
You just let us clean it up...

607
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,040
and I won't send any pictures of you to the missus...

608
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,617
or the Courier-

609
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,919
those images of how you like to use that mouth.

610
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,714
And I don't means stuffin' it with Moon Pies and Coca-Cola.

611
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,291
I tell you what.

612
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,173
What about that picture of you wiping the feces of that wetback...

613
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,004
I think the missus would like that one.

614
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,760
I think the missus would like that one.

615
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,716
She'd put it on the mantel at Christmastime...

616
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,302
right between them two stockings.

617
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:06,229
Yeah, you keep your queerhole shut, Sheriff...

618
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,435
everything gonna be just fine.

619
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,158
What happened in there?

620
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,986
Them kids was cuttin' themselves loose downstairs.

621
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,073
Caleb went to deal with it.

622
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,581
Shootin' 'em up while I'm out there with this law dog.

623
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,287
You want me to move his car on the property?

624
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,582
No.

625
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,134
Take him on across town.

626
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,338
Other side of the tracks, dump him off there.

627
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,426
Them Feds get rather investigative when it comes to killin' one of their own.

628
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,387
Hello?

629
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,969
This is Keenan.

630
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,143
I'm sorry. Who now?

631
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,559
Yes, sir.

632
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,441
That case is under preliminary investigation.

633
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:42,495
Report was members of the church were seeking semi-automatic firearms...

634
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,245
mid-2004, before AWB expired.

635
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,168
We have unconfirmed reports they got a few.

636
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:57,923
Well, the intelligence suggests that they were modifying the weapons.

637
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,222
At least that was the testimony of the guy who sold 'em some shotguns.

638
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,767
He said they made inquiries about modifications.

639
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:10,515
No, sir. Undercover infiltration was unsuccessful.

640
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,100
Can you-

641
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,357
I'm sorry. Sir?

642
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,110
Can I call you back?

643
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,109
Yes, sir. Thank you.
It'll just be a few minutes.

644
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,446
Oh, shit.

645
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,293
If you loved me, you'd make me some coffee.

646
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,637
Caleb?

647
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,888
Darlin'?

648
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,098
Oh, no!

649
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,478
No, Caleb!

650
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,608
Come on, baby doll. Come on.

651
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,234
Come on. Come on.

652
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,783
I know. I know, baby. I know.

653
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,277
Timothy 4, baby doll.

654
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,862
Timothy 4.

655
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,958
Timothy 4, baby. Timothy 4.

656
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,082
“I am now ready to be offered.

657
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:17,041
The time for my departure is at hand.

658
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,342
I have fought a good fight.

659
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,838
I have fought a good fight.

660
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,970
I have finished my course.

661
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,847
I have kept the faith.”

662
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,056
He's on the lovin' breast of Jesus, baby.

663
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,392
He's gone to Jesus.

664
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,526
I know, baby. I know. I know.

665
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,107
Come on.

666
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,817
Let me show you something, sweetie.

667
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,868
Let me show you something. Come on.

668
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,246
I want you to see something with me now.

669
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,448
- Look here.
- What?

670
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,158
Look here.

671
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,335
Caleb did not die in vain.

672
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,254
He sent them two devils to hell before they killed him.

673
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,009
Probably saved us all with his last dyin' breath.

674
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:14,848
You go rot in hell, you filthy, filthy-

675
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,854
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

676
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,810
Come on. We got one upstairs.

677
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,520
There's a land

678
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,324
- Save it for him. Am I right?
- Oh, Daddy, you're always right.

679
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,777
There's a land

680
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,489
Beyond the river

681
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,699
That they call

682
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:36,753
By fate's decree

683
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:41,004
And you only reach that shore

684
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,882
By fate's decree

685
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:50,934
By and by we'll cross the portal

686
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:57,187
Where we'll dwell with thee, immortal

687
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:01,020
When they ring those golden bells

688
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:04,072
They're a pretty tight-knit group.

689
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:08,698
Approximately 20, 25 members...

690
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,121
all related by blood or marriage.

691
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:17,373
Makes it impossible to get any coverts inside.

692
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,250
No, sir.

693
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:23,128
You're thinking of Fred Phelps and his family up in Kansas.

694
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,801
“God hates fags.”

695
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,097
They're irritating, but they're not gun nuts like the Coopers.

696
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,976
They're suers, not doers.

697
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,726
Last April someone at Five Points...

698
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,934
reported an IED setup on church property.

699
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:44,237
No injuries sustained and minimal damage done to a tree...

700
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,906
but in an interview with the local media...

701
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:51,236
Cooper claimed that if a bomb had gone off in a synagogue, a black church...

702
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,868
or a homo-friendly Unitarian coven...

703
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,323
there'd have been an uproar.

704
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,412
No suspects, no arrests.

705
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,496
Local law enforcement chalked it up to townie kids...

706
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,672
having fun at the church's expense.

707
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,797
But it spooked the Coopers into tearing down all the barns on their property...

708
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,470
turning 'em into barricade fences.

709
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,219
Locals call it “the great wall of bullshit.”

710
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,303
Yes, sir, after the one in China.

711
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,436
What made 'em persons of interest...

712
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:24,861
was an interview Cooper gave to the Patriot Times right about then.

713
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,405
He said that “If the law won't protect us...

714
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,778
from the Philistines and sodomites...

715
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,734
we'll protect ourselves.”

716
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:35,493
You couple that comment with the allegations, and you can see why...

717
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,458
we've had 'em on surveillance off and on.

718
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,127
They're pretty easy to keep track of.

719
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,671
When they're not protesting gay bars or chasing headlines...

720
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,794
they mostly stick to their compound...

721
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,546
hold their daily services.

722
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,180
I know I'm low man on the totem pole...

723
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,854
but are you sure that's wise at this juncture, sir?

724
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,234
Why? Because if you give us a few more days...

725
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,813
I'm sure we can dig up something more substantial than the sheriff's-

726
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,449
That's how you wanna play it.

727
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,247
No, sir, I'm not questioning your call at all, sir.

728
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,327
I'm saying that our history with situations like this hasn't been exactly-

729
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,427
Yes, sir. It's dawn here now...

730
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,426
but we can be fully mobilized and on site in an hour.

731
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,509
I understand.

732
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,335
Fuck!

733
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,559
Tempted and tried

734
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,356
We Te oft made to wonder

735
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,185
Why it should be

736
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,396
All the day long

737
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:36,485
While there are others

738
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,117
Living about us

739
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,746
Never molested

740
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,454
Doing wrong

741
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,757
When death has come

742
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,462
And taken our loved one

743
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,265
It makes our hearts

744
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,470
So weary and drear

745
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:08,600
Year after year

746
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,563
Why others prosper

747
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:16,991
Living so wicked

748
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:21,446
Year after year

749
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:27,753
Farther along we'll know all about it

750
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,969
Farther along we'll understand why

751
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:40,514
Cheer up, my brother

752
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,093
Live in the sunshine

753
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:49,649
We'll understand it all by and by

754
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,772
Come, sweetie. Come. Come.

755
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,318
Farther along

756
00:46:56,397 --> 00:47:00,777
We'll know all about it

757
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:06,996
Farther along we'll understand why

758
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:27,270
All by and by

759
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:48,783
Fuck!

760
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,081
Fast little monkey!

761
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,061
Who fired? Who fired, goddamn it!

762
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,521
Local Agent 3.

763
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,369
Goddamn it!

764
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,663
- What are you-
- Who the fuck are you?

765
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,456
Did he fire at us?

766
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,785
- No, he was armed.
- Did he open ire at us?

767
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,245
- Son of a bitch had a machine gun!
- They got kids in there, asshole!

768
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,127
- Sorry! I'm sorry.
- Kids you just turned into hostages!

769
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,583
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Asshole!

770
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:42,045
You can't talk to me, you son of a bitch.
I am a King's County elected official!

771
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,257
Sit your ass back in your vehicle!

772
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,842
Now!

773
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,371
How much you think a cross like that costs?

774
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,242
You mean in dollars or common sense?

775
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,077
Zing!

776
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,836
We get the spike mic set up?

777
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,389
Well, we were about to, and then Barney Fife happened.

778
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,301
Well-

779
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,854
Let's go old-school.
We get any blueprints or whatnot?

780
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,735
- 1922.
- It's all county had.

781
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:44,281
They haven't built an addition to the original structure for the last 50 years. No permits.

782
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:48,111
They got anything on four legs except horses we gotta look out for?

783
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,447
Isn't this a stable?

784
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,531
No, that's Home Depot.

785
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,748
It was a stud farm. 
Belonged to the last neighbors the Coopers ever had...

786
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,921
before Abin drove 'em off and bought the land.

787
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,797
That's where they load up with all the lumber so they can build this elegant fucking fence.

788
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:08,598
Million-dollar views from three directions and then, bam! 
“Casa de Bat Shit.”

789
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,846
Do you know how you get a valley this beautiful all to yourself?

790
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:15,021
Put a giant fucking cross on your front lawn.

791
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,768
Give me the horn.

792
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:26,775
This is Special Agent Joseph Keenan of the ATF.

793
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,699
We're here to execute a search warrant on the premises...

794
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,703
on suspicion of violation of the National Firearms Act.

795
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:40,255
Put down any weapons, come out with your hands up, and you will not be harmed.

796
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:44,425
Repeat: You will not be harmed.

797
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,472
I think it's the use of the word “repeat” that makes this work every time.

798
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,709
You wanna breach?

799
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,006
No.

800
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,667
Give 'em a minute.

801
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,262
Get a line opened up.

802
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,388
Yeah, that's gonna-

803
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,138
Come on!

804
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,892
Goddamn it!

805
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,694
Get down! Agent, get down!

806
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,863
Right now!

807
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,750
This is Special Agent Keenan, sir.

808
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,954
Cooper's Dell has escalated into a firefight.

809
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,039
Requesting backup.

810
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,250
Get the fuck outta here. Go grab a rifle.

811
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,424
The local sheriff shot and killed an armed assailant.

812
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:15,007
We C-C'd. They opened fire.

813
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,013
They shot Brooks.

814
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,639
The fucking church people!

815
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,397
They're heavy with AK's and TECs.

816
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,020
I need backup now!

817
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,905
You said this was gonna be a simple in-and-out, sir.

818
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,695
Simple just shit itself.

819
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,575
Media, sir?

820
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,287
The closest TV station's a hundred miles away.

821
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,088
The local paper prints once a week.

822
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,881
Media's not a factor, sir.

823
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,507
Sir, that sounds like-

824
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,387
With all due respect, sir...

825
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,644
maybe we should get the deputy assistant director on this call.

826
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,977
Jesus Christ, there's kids in there, sir!

827
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,779
Just give me another 10 minutes.
I can open up a line-

828
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,904
I'm gonna want something in writing to protect myself and my field office.

829
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,795
No, I'm gonna need something more substantial than your word for this.

830
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,044
Either I get a text, or an e-mail, or something official...

831
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,422
I can stand behind or it's no-go.

832
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,185
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

833
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,606
Down! Who else is coming out that door, huh?

834
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,609
- It's just me.
- Bullshit!

835
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,861
There's kids in there and I wanna get 'em out.

836
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,671
Is that Group 2?
Are they sending us more agents?

837
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,090
The situation's been reclassified.

838
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,798
We're to take down this domestic terrorist cell.

839
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,255
- We fired on them first, Joe.
- We didn't.

840
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,385
That fat fucking asshole local.

841
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,842
What are the orders?

842
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,185
Hold on a second. 
We don't even know what the goddamn situation is in there.

843
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,609
Our intel is limited. We've had no fucking communication with them!

844
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,857
“Our investigation of the Five Point Church...

845
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,860
at Cooper's Dell has uncovered an extremely hostile...

846
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,692
domestic terrorist cell, heavily armed...

847
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,746
with intentions of bombing a local shopping mall this morning.”

848
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,288
You're fucking kidding me!

849
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,582
“When we came with arrest warrants, they opened fire on us...

850
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,876
killing the assistant special agent in charge...

851
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,751
leaving us no choice but to take the premises with deadly force.”

852
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,838
Jesus Christ.

853
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,966
There are women, and there are kids inside there, man.

854
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,970
“In the resulting firefight, all suspects were killed.”

855
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,056
Give 'em the gas, then dynamic entry.

856
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,108
Joe, the suits ain't here.

857
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:15,112
We're here, Joe.
You're here. You can call this.

858
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,485
And then what, Harry?

859
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,817
The FBI takes over, and we look like assholes...

860
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,073
who can't do our jobs- again.

861
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,031
That's what happens the minute a single news van rolls up...

862
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,912
and any one of these people walks out of there alive...

863
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,915
goes on CNN and says we're the bad guys.

864
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,793
Doesn't matter who the fuck's around to tell it to the goddamn news.

865
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:37,092
That's exactly what we're gonna be- the fucking bad guys!

866
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,169
I got 18 years in.

867
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,847
I'm not telling my wife she's gotta clip coupons till we're dead...

868
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,846
'cause I couldn't follow a simple order, shitty as that order is.

869
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,927
And we're not talking about Gandhi here.

870
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,229
I got a piece of Brooke's skull in my fucking knee.

871
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,398
They're shooting at us with military ordnance.

872
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,692
These ain't a bunch of tweakers in a motel meth lab.

873
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,485
They are big bad eggs.

874
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,238
Get your men ready for a breach.

875
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,699
Sir, I've apprehended one of the suspects

876
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,280
Unarmed girl, early 20s.

877
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,866
She's says she's the caretaker of the kids in the house.

878
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,874
She says she wants to get the kids out the back without her people knowing.

879
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,455
I think she's legit, sir.

880
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,461
Requesting instructions. Over.

881
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,097
This is a hostile domestic terrorist cell.

882
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,799
Use of deadly force is permitted.

883
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,929
- She's not even armed. Over.
- We're not terrorists.

884
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,390
Those are your goddamn orders.

885
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,897
It's the wrong move, Joe.

886
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,608
We're not terrorists.
We're not. You can't do this. Please.

887
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,959
- No! We're not terrorists!
- Stay back! Stay back!

888
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:56,164
Please, don't! Please! Oh, God.

889
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,096
You need to take this gun and go back to the house, ma'am.

890
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,048
- Run back to the house.
- I don't want it.

891
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,758
Take the gun and head back into the house!

892
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,933
No! You're gonna shoot me!

893
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,182
Take the fucking gun, bitch, and go to the house!

894
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,184
No! Oh, God!

895
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,434
Get in there!

896
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,023
Your daddy's dead.

897
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,735
This is how you respect his memory?

898
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,912
By trying to run out on your family?

899
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,207
No. Mama, they think we're terrorists.
They're gonna kill us all.

900
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,000
Good.

901
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,875
Then I'll be in heaven with Caleb.

902
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,173
Isn't that what you want?

903
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,124
To be with your daddy and Jesus?

904
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,382
But, Mama, what about Melanie and the babies?

905
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,805
Me and the babies, Mama.

906
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,805
“How sharper than a serpent's tooth to have a thankless child”!

907
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:56,232
You get down on your knees and pray for God's forgiveness!

908
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,193
When you get done with that...

909
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,397
you take this, come join your family up front.

910
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,738
Come on, come on.

911
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,371
- Like a good Christian.
- Yeah.

912
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,226
They're trying to kill the children, Daddy.

913
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,474
They're trying to kill us all, baby.

914
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,313
I don't wanna live in this world no more.

915
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,778
I wanna go to Jesus.

916
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,283
Well, baby...

917
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,861
if you die...

918
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:56,785
fighting an army of sodomite-protecting idolaters...

919
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,747
I suspect the good Lord's gonna give you a mansion in his kingdom.

920
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,963
You always know what to say to make me feel better, Daddy.

921
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,637
“Now learn ye the parable of a fig tree.”

922
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,802
Yes.

923
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,388
Such as Matthew 24.

924
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,815
“When his branch is yet tender...

925
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,312
and putteth forth leaves...

926
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,311
know that summer is nigh.”

927
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,813
Well, baby...

928
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,948
looks like summer's about as nigh as it ever gonna get.

929
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,645
Let's go.

930
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,981
I shall see the face of the Lord...

931
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,566
and the Lord's glory shall surely-

932
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,917
You're gonna be quiet, okay?

933
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,714
I don't wanna shoot you, but I will.

934
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,381
Okay?

935
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,556
Okay.

936
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,225
Are Travis and Billy-Ray dead?

937
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,991
So what? You gonna fucking kill me?

938
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,747
If you help me, I won't.

939
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,079
Else I will, I swear.

940
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,006
There's government agents outside...

941
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,467
and they wanna come in here and kill my family.

942
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,177
- Fucking good!
- Will you shut up?

943
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,433
I'm trying to save your life.

944
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:28,732
Those government people- they're gonna kill you too.

945
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,689
They already shot your friend...

946
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,240
and they are gonna kill everyone in this house...

947
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,739
'cause they screwed up what they came here to do.

948
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,823
They're gonna kill us so that we can't tell on 'em.

949
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,117
They don't want any witnesses...

950
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:49,002
so they're gonna bust in here and shoot all of us...

951
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,835
even my little brothers and my sister and my cousins.

952
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,429
But I can't let the babies get killed.

953
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,632
I've done some bad things.

954
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,060
But if I let them babies get killed-

955
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,818
They don't know what we've been up to in here.

956
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:14,239
If they did, they could just arrest us.

957
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,191
They could put us on trial...

958
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:20,529
and then the Zionist media would make heroes out of 'em.

959
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:23,115
But they are gonna need witnesses...

960
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,497
and that's you.

961
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,503
That's you.

962
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,835
So, if you and me...

963
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:38,718
we can get out there without gettin' killed...

964
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,801
we can tell 'em what's really goin' on in the chapel.

965
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,137
We do that, and they can't kill the babies.

966
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,190
Sara, baby.

967
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,493
Gimme some sweet tea, will you?

968
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,926
- You want me to save your life?
- No, no.

969
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,017
You want me to save your life?

970
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,432
You killed my fucking friends.

971
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:34,236
It's not me I care about so much as I care about the kids.

972
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,905
My cousin's kid ain't but three years old and my little sis-

973
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,198
My little sister's only eight.

974
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,425
Fuck you.

975
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,879
You think they're gonna believe that you weren't one of us?

976
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:05,058
They won't even give you the chance to tell 'em before they put one in your head.

977
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:10,644
'Cause once they get inside here that is exactly what they're gonna do.

978
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,101
You think I give a shit?

979
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,190
Fuck you...

980
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,071
and your stupid family.

981
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,370
My two best friends are fucking dead.

982
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,198
So you know what?
Why don't you just go on and kill me too?

983
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,706
You can take that gun and just fucking kill me too.

984
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,503
Just put a bullet in my fucking head...

985
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:37,173
because that's what I've been waiting for since you tied me to a fucking cross!

986
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,384
Cheyenne!

987
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,171
Please.

988
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,425
Yeah, I bet Billy-Ray said please too.

989
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,185
And they still killed him.

990
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,897
So fuck you.

991
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,145
And if you wanna save your precious fucking babies...

992
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,819
why don't you suck a fucking rescue outta my dick, bitch?

993
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,023
What?

994
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,154
You get away from her, you heathen!

995
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,907
- Get the fuck off me!
- You!

996
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,454
Mama, please! Mama, stop it!

997
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,625
- Mama, please! Mama!
- Get off!

998
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,630
- You damn heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!

999
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,502
What are you trying to do to her?

1000
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,460
Trying to get what you came for?
What did you do to my girl?

1001
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,715
Mama!

1002
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,218
What's the matter with you, girl?

1003
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,638
What's got over you?

1004
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:33,096
Will you put that gun down?
His friends killed your daddy.

1005
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,523
If we just confess, they can't kill the babies.

1006
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,048
No, don't go anywhere!

1007
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,944
There's men outside and they aim to kill us.

1008
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:24,489
So you take everybody up to the attic, okay?

1009
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,864
You barricade the door. Okay?

1010
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,569
What'd you do?

1011
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,280
You do it!
You get 'em up there, goddamn it!

1012
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,162
- You do it right now!
- What did you do, Cheyenne?

1013
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,461
- Go!
- Mama!

1014
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,039
Mommy! Mommy!

1015
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,252
Is Mama dead?

1016
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:50,841
Listen.

1017
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:57,689
You go on with Maggie and the other kids upstairs now, okay?

1018
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:01,985
You go up to the attic and you stay there until I come get you.

1019
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,941
You don't open that door for nobody else but me, okay? 
You understand?

1020
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,322
Okay, you go on now.

1021
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,902
Quick, like a bunny.

1022
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,082
Stevie, go!

1023
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,257
Go, go, go!

1024
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,146
Cocksuckers!

1025
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,800
Mordechai!

1026
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:15,179
Top of the crown! Top of the crown!

1027
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,064
The Lord is our shepherd.

1028
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,029
The Lord is my shepherd.

1029
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,769
Team, get ready to flank!

1030
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,124
No!

1031
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,205
- Freeze! Drop your weapon!
- Look, don't shoot. I'm a hostage, okay?

1032
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,538
- We need to talk to who's in charge.
- Drop the fucking gun!

1033
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,623
You don't have to do this.

1034
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,004
Get back.

1035
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,632
There's enough evidence to put us all away for life.

1036
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,179
- Don't move!
- Get back, all right?

1037
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,803
There's babies in the attic!

1038
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,052
No!

1039
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,183
You all right?

1040
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,160
What the fuck was that?

1041
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,393
Yes, sir!

1042
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:11,227
Yes, sir! He's calling us home!

1043
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,856
Come on, come on!

1044
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,485
Come on, children! Come on!

1045
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,530
Everywhere; everywhere

1046
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,700
Drop the artillery!

1047
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,059
There be no need for that any more.

1048
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,270
Where's that sound coming from?

1049
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,651
“And the four angels were loosed...

1050
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,826
which were prepared for an hour and a day...

1051
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,404
and a month and a year...

1052
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,910
to slay a third of men.”

1053
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,081
Hear ye!

1054
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,130
His sacred call to arms!

1055
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:17,709
The heavenly trumpets sound his name!

1056
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,466
The one true God comes to rapture!

1057
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,139
His faithful slay the wicked...

1058
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:27,594
and send this evil world straight to hell!

1059
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,265
Enough! Enough, goddamn it! Enough!

1060
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,646
Wait a minute!
just wait a minute, everybody.

1061
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,939
No more fire and brimstone, preacher!

1062
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,200
What does that sound mean?

1063
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,074
Well, boy...

1064
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:50,791
there ain't nothing left but fire and brimstone.

1065
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,827
Can't you hear?

1066
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:54,958
Can't you hear?

1067
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:00,293
This is the Lord's day of judgment.

1068
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,721
Four trumpet blasts.

1069
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,844
The seals have been opened...

1070
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:08,597
and the horsemen dispatched.

1071
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,678
Three more blasts...

1072
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:16,234
and he closes the book on this wicked, wicked world!

1073
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:19,609
- Praise His name!
- Praise His name!

1074
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,280
So come on!

1075
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,157
Come on, G-man.

1076
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,944
“G” for “Godless.”

1077
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,122
“G” for “government”

1078
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,914
Come on.

1079
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,913
Come on. Shoot me.

1080
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,461
flag-worshipping heathen!

1081
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:39,211
flag-worshipping heathen!

1082
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:43,386
Shoot me!
It only hastens my reward in eternity.

1083
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:47,841
Shoot me! Shoot me!

1084
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,184
Ana' then what happened?

1085
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,395
Special Agent Keenan?

1086
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,402
Special Agent Keenan?

1087
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:04,983
What happened?

1088
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,787
I subdued the suspect...

1089
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,489
with a head butt.

1090
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:15,752
- A head butt?
- Yes, sir. The suspect was standing...

1091
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,875
unnaturally close.

1092
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:24,090
And then the trumpet blast sounded three more times, and a fourth and a fifth.

1093
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,637
By then it was pretty clear the rapture wasn't going to happen.

1094
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:30,842
So we rounded up the remaining Five Pointers.

1095
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,598
On the record, Agent Keenan...

1096
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,100
this inquiry commends you for peaceably containing...

1097
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,022
a potentially explosive situation.

1098
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,601
But, off the record...

1099
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:42,528
you disobeyed a direct order from a superior, Joe.

1100
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,652
I did.

1101
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:50,032
And I have no excuse that's gonna mean anything here.

1102
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,575
that Special Agent Joseph Keenan be relieved...

1103
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,850
Well, it is the finding of this inquiry...

1104
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,019
that Special Agent Joseph Keenan be relieved...

1105
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:17,597
after which time he'll report to the Washington office...

1106
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,354
He's to be placed on one-week leave without pay...

1107
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,276
after which time he'll report to the Washington office...

1108
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,774
for reassignment in the District.

1109
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,441
I'm getting promoted?

1110
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,705
You're still gonna kill him.

1111
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,203
Of course we're gonna kill him, Joe.

1112
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,285
in or out of custody.

1113
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,381
Of course we're gonna kill him, Joe.

1114
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,928
We're gonna kill him with kindness.

1115
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,223
- You're gonna let him go to trial?
- Oh, come on.

1116
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,472
- What is this, September 10, 2001?
- Patriot Act, bitch.

1117
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,680
We can plant him forever, okay?
Without a trial.

1118
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,937
Never show him the light of day, let alone a TV camera or a microphone.

1119
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,063
How-

1120
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,395
What do you think we've been doing the last 10 years?

1121
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,527
Yeah. It's terrorism, Joe. Okay?

1122
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:12,361
If you kill an American because of a religious belief, you are a terrorist...

1123
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,741
and terrorists get locked the fuck up.

1124
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,949
If it's all so easy to put these people away for life...

1125
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,875
why was I given those orders?

1126
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,628
Truth?

1127
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,709
- 'Cause fuck people like this.
- They're animals.

1128
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,419
I mean, don't get me wrong. Jesus saves.

1129
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:33,223
He ain't gonna save Abin Cooper from a fuck-load of prison rape.

1130
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,267
Daily shtuppings by Coke-can cocks.

1131
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,140
Savor that irony, Joe.

1132
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:43,391
Hey, what was it?

1133
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,270
- The trumpet blast.
- Pardon?

1134
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,072
The trumpet blast- What was it really?

1135
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,070
Oh, that.

1136
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,651
Some new neighbors-

1137
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,455
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff because of the smell of the compost.

1138
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:02,582
they got an acre off the ass end of the Five Point property, other side of the hill.

1139
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,880
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff because of the smell of the compost.

1140
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:09,004
- Was it bad?
- Gets so you can taste it.

1141
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,591
But Abin's been harassing these kids...

1142
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,468
sending some of his bigger boys over...

1143
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,470
to bitch at first...

1144
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,677
maybe break a window or two.

1145
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,636
The eco kids never so much as called the cops.

1146
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,940
Lots of sugar in gas tanks, burning bags of dog shit.

1147
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:27,643
- College kids.
- No, that was Cooper and his church.

1148
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,696
The eco kids never so much as called the cops.

1149
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:32,398
They-

1150
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,442
They got creative instead.

1151
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:39,326
They thought it'd be funny to take a page out of Revelations...

1152
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,454
and get Cooper and his family's hopes up with the trumpets.

1153
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:49,249
So they got this big-ass, rusty old siren...

1154
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,959
from a firehouse that just got a new one.

1155
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:56,843
The Ere chief said they could have the damn thing as long as they carted it off.

1156
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,720
It's big as a Mini Cooper.

1157
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,928
So they truck this thing down to their compost collective...

1158
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:05,811
they put it in a barn, they hook it up to an iPod of all things...

1159
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,359
and they played these single-note trumpet blasts...

1160
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,311
that they pulled off the Internet.

1161
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,772
And they had no idea that you were even there.

1162
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,776
It was just dumb luck.

1163
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:27,120
Oh, those eco kids with the compost collective?

1164
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,919
Turns out it was a cover for a marijuana grow-house.

1165
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,921
They're being booked right now.

1166
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,503
But considering how they probably saved a bunch more lives-

1167
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,429
Yeah, yeah. I'll write a letter.

1168
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:39,844
Yeah.

1169
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,301
Hey, Joe.

1170
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,313
Really...

1171
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,356
why did you shine the direct?

1172
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:58,026
My grandma on my mother's side-

1173
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,828
she had these two dogs, pure bloodhounds...

1174
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,245
both came up the same litter.

1175
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:10,421
She kept them and gave the rest away to the neighbors.

1176
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:14,000
Both known each other since they had shit in their eyes.

1177
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,678
Neither one ever treated any better than the other one.

1178
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,302
Gentlest dogs you'd ever care to meet.

1179
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,181
So anyway-

1180
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,639
Thanksgiving of my ninth year, these two old dogs are trailing me around...

1181
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:32,818
'cause they know the score- I'm an animal lover who never finishes his supper.

1182
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,442
So right before I get up from the table...

1183
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,650
I toss these two old-timers a turkey leg...

1184
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,655
attached to a hunk of cartilage.

1185
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,786
And it was like they'd never met.

1186
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:48,162
They went at each other so ferociously-

1187
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:52,122
all tooth and claw and jugular-

1188
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,832
They forgot anything they ever had in common...

1189
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:59,421
and scrapped like that discard decided between their standing and dying.

1190
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:10,773
I see the face of Jesus

1191
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:17,647
But they do even stranger things when they just plain believe.

1192
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,863
On my way tonight

1193
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:25,071
On my way tonight

1194
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:34,881
He says to me 
Old sinner, come on in

1195
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:41,049
I see the face of Jesus

1196
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,098
In that great white light

1197
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,854
And my savior makes me whole again

1198
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,812
In his shining eyes-

1199
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:02,066
In his shining eyes...

1200
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,110
I see the promise...

1201
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:10,241
of all forgiveness that sets you free.

1202
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,832
I see the face of Jesus...

1203
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,706
on my way this night.

1204
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:27,058
And my savior's light to comfort me

1205
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,930
Shut the fuck up!
