1
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,568
What are you going to do this weekend?

2
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,766
- I don't know. What are you doing?
- It's none of your business.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,867
Did you finish that thing
for your Lit class?

4
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,004
No. It's due in like two weeks
or something.

5
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:53,274
Oh, sweet Jesus in the morning.

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,545
Again with these people?

7
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,828
He's burning' in hell!

8
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,118
Because, if what the framers
of our constitution mean...

9
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,285
What, Travis? Fifteen minutes?

10
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,692
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

11
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,696
Where you been?

12
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,096
I was dropping my grandma off
at the airport...

13
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:45,160
and on the way back the Five-Pointers
blocked up Lennox Hill.

14
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,796
Oh, so Abin Cooper's after you too now?

15
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,205
Yeah, and I isn’t even gay.

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,710
Nah, you're not gay. You're just curious.

17
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,837
If anybody would know,
it would be Jarod.

18
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,415
What?

19
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,983
All right, all right, all right.

20
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:02,919
So every once in a while
we add amendments to the Constitution...

21
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:07,686
to expand, or more importantly, define,
the parameters of our rights.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,261
Like the First Amendment...

23
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,889
which Abin Cooper practiced this morning
on Lennox, making Travis late.

24
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,796
Those people are such assholes.

25
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,393
Okay. I'm going to let that ride
because this is a passionate issue...

26
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,803
and because, yes, they are assholes.

27
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,939
Wait. Who's Abin Cooper?

28
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,477
He's that creepy church guy...

29
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,309
that's always saying
how God's all pissed off at everybody.

30
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,882
Yeah, him and his family are the ones...

31
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,248
that are always holding up signs
outside of funerals and stuff.

32
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,480
This was they were protesting the funeral...

33
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,715
of the gay kid who
got killed two weeks ago.

34
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,291
Yeah. Jacob Harlow.

35
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,360
He went here.
I didn't teach him, but he went here.

36
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,928
It was all over the news, right?

37
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,088
Jessie, I am both happy and sad...

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,258
that you don't know
who Abin Cooper is...

39
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,233
but, I mean, come on.

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,928
Abin Cooper
and the Five Points Trinity Church...

41
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,903
they're like right in our own backyard.

42
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,703
Come on, Mrs. Vasquez,
Cooper's Dell is like 30 minutes away.

43
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,743
Yeah. Too close.

44
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,678
Abin Cooper holds
our entire state up for ridicule.

45
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,443
All right?
Ultraconservatives avoid this guy.

46
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:10,114
Did you know last year the head of the
largest neo-Nazi faction in this country...

47
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,919
issued a statement
distancing his politics...

48
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,961
from Cooper's and Five Points'?

49
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,031
Even the Nazis think this guy
is "nuckin' futs. "

50
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:24,296
All right, let's just hope that the Cooper
clan sticks with the First Amendment...

51
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,931
- Why?
- And stays away from the Second Amendment.

52
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,204
- What is the Second Amendment?
- We get guns.

53
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,411
What is this, man?

54
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,317
It's like Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

55
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,913
I thought Craigslist was Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

56
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,549
What kind of dirty shit you looking' at, boy?

57
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,121
Fuck, faggot!

58
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,928
Touch my dick again and see what happens.

59
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,133
- Such an animal.
- They're all the same, man.

60
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,503
- You can't see any faces.
- Oh, shit. You showing' him?

61
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,803
Dude, get your fucking' flappers
outta here.

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,741
Yeah, look, it doesn't matter.
You can see the tits.

63
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,779
You can see the fucking' pussy, man.
Fuck the faces.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,644
How we know we want to fuck the face
unless we can see what they look like?

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,480
- Right, thank you.
- You fucking' bag their head, man. All right?

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,247
Look, these bitches want to fuck.

67
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,550
Even if they do want to fuck,
they're all in New York and LA.

68
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,124
Lots more in LA Look...

69
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,193
New York. LA.

70
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,625
- Road trip.
- LA.

71
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,697
- LA...
- I get the point, all right, but look.

72
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,424
This one's a little closer to home.

73
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,101
Holy shit! Cooper's Dell?

74
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,432
- Let me see.
- No fucking' way!

75
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,199
We're getting' laid, boys.

76
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,298
How do we know she's going to fuck us,
or even one of us?

77
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,502
I've been talking back and forth with one
for two weeks now.

78
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,203
She says she's interested.

79
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,780
Fucking'...

80
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,781
I just got a little hard.

81
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,443
I don't want to fucking' fuck
some chick that he just stuck his dick in.

82
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,146
- Look, look...
- His greasy-assed fucking' dick.

83
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,722
It's not greasy.

84
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,018
There isn’t going to be no sloppy seconds,
boy, okay?

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,187
She wants to fuck
all three of us at the same time.

86
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,661
- Jesus Christ.
- I call the ass.

87
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,496
You're not getting' the fucking' ass.

88
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,833
What if this turns out to be one of them
Catch a Predator deals?

89
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,405
Who we preying' on?

90
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,874
We're the fucking' minors here.
She's the one who says she's 38.

91
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,174
Jesus. It's going to be like fucking my mom.

92
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,215
I isn’t sure it isn’t
your mom, motherfucker.

93
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,342
- Fuck you.
- I don't think I should go, man.

94
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,579
I'm having some doubts over here.

95
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,155
Oh, you're going.

96
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,156
You don't think the three of us
balling this woman in the same room...

97
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,988
is a little faggoty?

98
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,927
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't be so fucking' middle-class.

99
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,062
I'm going to take the car out, all right?

100
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,898
No, no, no. Hey, we're going to be
on TV in a minute. Watch.

101
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,599
This was the scene this morning
outside the funeral of Jacob Harlow...

102
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,835
the 19-year-old whose body
was found last week...

103
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,401
in a Dumpster behind a well-known gay bar
on Slattery Drive...

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,674
bound head-to-toe in plastic wrap.

105
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,546
Harlow is the latest victim
in a rash of hate crimes...

106
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,313
that have rocked the city this year.

107
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,584
Pastor Abin Cooper and the members
Of his Five Points Trinity Church...

108
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:03,253
staged their 432nd
funeral demonstration since 2001.

109
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,297
- This is Catherine Carlyle...
- Oh, oh, oh! There we are.

110
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,229
There we are.

111
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,734
- I'm sleeping with a TV star tonight.
- Yeah, you are.

112
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,361
How'd you know
we were going to be on there?

113
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,963
Barbara called me.
She saw it on the 5:00 news.

114
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,474
So you going to tell your friends
we're famous?

115
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,875
- Probably not.
- Smart ass.

116
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,640
Where you off to tonight?

117
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,740
I don't know. Just going to drive around
with Jarod and Billy-Ray.

118
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,819
Probably go see a movie or something.

119
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,944
Fill up the tank before you bring it back.

120
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,047
- Can I get some money for gas?
- No.

121
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,750
Later.

122
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,869
So how are we going to do this?

123
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,279
How do you mean?

124
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,473
Talking' about how are you
going to get under us.

125
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,177
- What are you talking about?
- Me and the lady.

126
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,015
You fucking'...

127
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,753
This is what happens when fucking' parents
block porn sites, man.

128
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,690
They make socially backwards kids.

129
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,320
How about you just pull over
and let me out.

130
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,331
Come on, man. You're being...
Oh, fuck!

131
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,564
- You hit it.
- Fuck.

132
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,139
You fucking' hit it.

133
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,674
Why the fuck are we getting' out?

134
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,178
It's so fucking' dark out
no one could see us if they were looking.

135
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,047
Holy shit! Look at your fucking' car.

136
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,813
Your fucking' car!

137
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,082
- Are you kidding me?
- Holy shit, man.

138
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,886
Dude, that's, like, a lot of... damage.

139
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,119
That sucks, man.

140
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,255
Who the fuck parks their car
on the side of the road like that?

141
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,832
You think there's somebody in there?

142
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,799
I don't know, man. Nobody's here.

143
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,563
Why the fuck did you stop?

144
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,969
Oh, fuck. You got 'em real good.

145
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,206
- Holy fuck!
- Fuck!

146
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,641
- Fuck!
- Get in the car! Get in the car!

147
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,142
They isn’t following us.

148
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,221
Why in the fuck was that guy
on the side of the road?

149
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,756
Who cares, man?
Let's just keep fucking' going.

150
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,554
- My car's fucked up, man!
- Well, guess what.

151
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,890
Your car's going to be fucked up
when you get home too.

152
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,520
So why don't we just keep going?

153
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,223
We're in Cooper's Dell already.

154
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,301
We'll hate ourselves tomorrow
if we don't do this.

155
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,837
- I'm not going to hate myself.
- I'm going to hate not getting that pussy...

156
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,907
so let's not take this little
fender-bender as a bad omen, boys.

157
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,670
Let's fucking do this!

158
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,781
Lasso me some pussy!

159
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,151
She lives in a trailer?

160
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,490
You live in a trailer, motherfucker.

161
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,890
I was just asking'. Damn.

162
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,621
You Jarod?

163
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,591
This here is Travis, and that's Billy-Ray.

164
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,937
I bet you boys want to get up
to the devil's business, don't you?

165
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,071
Well, devil's right in here.

166
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,555
You look lovely.

167
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,990
How 'bout a beer, boys?

168
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,956
Hey, Pete. Can you believe it?
I got sideswiped tonight.

169
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,525
- You get 'em?
- No.

170
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,427
I was parked and they kept moving'.

171
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,199
Why were you parked?

172
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:41,729
Oh, I was making' a reservation for Helen,
tomorrow night for our 19th.

173
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,968
I'm thinking about taking Darla
someplace special...

174
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,237
for our fifth next month.

175
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,973
Someplace overseas, you know?

176
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,209
Like maybe Italy.

177
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,309
Soon as I win enough off these doggies.

178
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,720
Well, win enough to do this damn body work
on my car, would ya?

179
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,860
Dumb-ass kids.

180
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,996
How you know they was kids?

181
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,725
I don't know.
They was in some kind of Mom-mobile.

182
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,860
Suppose that's mighty keen
detecting skills there, Sheriff.

183
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,700
Yeah, well...

184
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,537
I'm going to need you
to go out there and find 'em.

185
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,745
You kidding' me?
I'm off the clock 10 minutes now.

186
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,145
The only reason I'm still here
is 'cause you're so damn late.

187
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,651
Jesus Christ. Just go out
and find the damn car, will ya?

188
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,950
It's a blue Volvo station wagon.

189
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,075
Geez.

190
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,644
This is nice.

191
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,977
You boys finished your beers yet?

192
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,276
- I'm working' on it.
- Almost. Almost.

193
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,152
Takes me a few beers
to work up to the sex.

194
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,625
So get drinking',
'cause I isn’t drinking' alone.

195
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,566
And I don't let no man in me
unless he's got at least two beers in him.

196
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,261
Thank you, ma'am.

197
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,837
Makes sense.

198
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,681
This is nice.

199
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,477
Will you close your fucking' legs?

200
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,755
It's like a shag.

201
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,027
So how's about you head back
into the bedroom...

202
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,087
start stripping' down
so we can get this thing started.

203
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,901
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,665
Almost don't even fit in here.

205
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,775
Get them beers drunk.

206
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,111
This bitch wants my dick, don't she?

207
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,278
She is a lot better looking.

208
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,824
Them tits isn’t nothing'
to write home about.

209
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:14,551
Those tits are...

210
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,795
Fuck!

211
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,690
What the fuck?

212
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,870
Fucking' roofies.

213
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,763
Hello?

214
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,233
Guys?

215
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,836
Is that you, Travis? Billy-Ray?

216
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,418
On a hill far away

217
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,351
All right, guys, come on.
Seriously, let me outta here.

218
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,913
Can you just let me outta here, please?

219
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,392
The emblem of suffering...

220
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,692
Guys, this isn't fucking' funny, all right?
Will you let me outta here, please!

221
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,767
What the fuck is going on?

222
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,201
Let me the fuck outta here,
please, all right?

223
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,738
This isn't funny anymore.

224
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,468
This isn't fucking' funny anymore.
This isn't funny anymore, man.

225
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,737
Come on, let me the fuck out!

226
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,540
I swear to God,
I'm going to fucking' kill you!

227
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,046
Let me out!

228
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,413
If you guys don't let me
the fuck outta here, I'm going to kill you!

229
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,918
I will cherish

230
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:53,014
The old rugged cross

231
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,052
Will you find somebody to...

232
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,960
Can somebody please let me outta here?
Please?

233
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,124
- Lucas, sit down.
- Fucking' bitch.

234
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,701
Hey, you fucking' bitch!

235
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,963
Let me the fuck outta here,
you fucking' bitch!

236
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,130
The old rugged cross

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,707
Fuck!

238
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,913
And exchange it someday

239
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,884
For a crown

240
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,951
Well, how about that?

241
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,219
That was lovely.

242
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,125
Just lovely.

243
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,722
Y'all give that Mormon Tabernacle Choir
a run for their money.

244
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,496
You know what this is?

245
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,498
That's a printout of what we done today.

246
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,701
That's an article that appears
in tomorrow's Post.

247
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,607
You know what that's called?

248
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,472
National coverage.

249
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,710
- Sure was.
- Indeed, it was.

250
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,215
Abigail...

251
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,483
TiVo'd the segment on the 5:00 news.

252
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,692
Y'all can watch it later if you want to...

253
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,194
and see yourselves on the TV.

254
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,866
Yeah, tell you what
we going to do next week.

255
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,460
We going to paint the garage.

256
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,539
I know how you love that,
but we going to paint.

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,369
Someone, please!
Come on, please!

258
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,807
I need big, strong volunteers.
How about you?

259
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,146
How about you? You big and strong?

260
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,846
RJ?

261
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,080
Show me how Popeye do.

262
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,591
Popeye!

263
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,321
Yeah, oh, wow! Don't hurt me, Popeye.

264
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,329
Oh, Popeye, don't hurt me.

265
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,400
Will somebody please
let me the fuck outta here!

266
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,993
Caleb, come on, now.
That's a bit much. Now, come on, come on.

267
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,440
No! Fuck! Fuck!

268
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,512
- Welcome, family.
- Good evening'.

269
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,887
- Good evening', Granddaddy.
- Good evening', Grandpa.

270
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,619
Good evening.

271
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,888
But what's so good about it?

272
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:15,296
Psalms 117, verse 24.

273
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,235
"This is the day which the Lord hath made.

274
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,774
We will rejoice and be glad in it. "

275
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,467
Glad in it.

276
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,942
"Oh, woe is me
if I preach not the gospels. "

277
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,913
Corinthians 9:16.

278
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,380
Amen, Grandpa.

279
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,313
Oh, well, I think
I'm going to preach that holy word.

280
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,889
- Preach it, Daddy.
- Yes.

281
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,925
We read in Hebrews 11...

282
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,157
By faith... by faith...

283
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:50,361
Noah, being warned by God
of things not seen as yet...

284
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,162
prepared an ark...

285
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,601
for the saving' of his house...

286
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,437
by which he condemned all others.

287
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,012
For there was multitudes
upon multitudes of people...

288
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,581
and God drowned them
all except Noah and his flock.

289
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,207
Drowned them all.
All sinners gone to hell.

290
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,785
Praise his name.

291
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,982
I'm good at climbing.
I'm good at climbing.

292
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:19,259
You talk to some of them maudlin,
touchy-feely preachers out there...

293
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,992
peddling' their soft faith...

294
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,796
they going to tell you what you want to hear.

295
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,368
They isn’t going to tell you
what you need to know.

296
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,873
They can't. Can't tell you the truth.

297
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,309
Why, it might be politically incorrect.

298
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,981
But they'll tell you...

299
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,516
this nation and the world
is going' to hell.

300
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,451
They won't tell you why.
Can't tell you why.

301
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,085
They'll tell you...

302
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,124
"God loves you.

303
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,923
God loves everybody. "

304
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,465
Does a God that drowned the entire world,
exception of Noah and his flock...

305
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,901
sound like a God that loves you?

306
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:00,972
No.

307
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,633
That sound like a God
that forgives your sins?

308
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,209
- No!
- No, sir.

309
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,141
Your carnal desires?

310
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,380
That's not God's love.

311
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,541
That's a God that abhors the wicked.

312
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,586
He abhors those
that ignore his righteous teaching...

313
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,013
and forsake his covenant...

314
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,887
and scoff at his acts.

315
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,519
God doesn't love you...

316
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,121
unless you fear him.

317
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,633
We talk about a fear we have
of certain snakes.

318
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,366
Well, that'd be a righteous fear.

319
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,568
We talking' about a fear we have
of taken' a cookie...

320
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,838
Grandma's cookie jar...

321
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,743
'fraid of being caught?

322
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,210
I don't believe so.

323
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,117
Talking' about the fear of God. I fear God.

324
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,451
You better believe I fear God.

325
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,285
But my fear is born out of respect...

326
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,362
- Oh, fuck.
- Admiration...

327
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,293
devotion...

328
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,195
sacrifice...

329
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,857
adoration...

330
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,936
and knowledge of the scripture...

331
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,565
that I preach.

332
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,474
Give us some knowledge, Daddy.
Give us some knowledge.

333
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,104
But I preach knowledge,
and I preach to this...

334
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,981
and I preach, and I preach...

335
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,450
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.

336
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,548
I preach like my daddy before me,
and his daddy before him.

337
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,125
My granddaddy built this church
going' on a hundred years ago.

338
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,994
He used to minister up there...

339
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:38,229
at the 12th St. Baptist
up there in the city...

340
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:44,135
till he couldn't stomach
what he called the deviltry anymore.

341
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,111
So he abandoned that modern-day Gomorrah
and settled Cooper's Dell...

342
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:51,011
June, 1917.

343
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,683
But if he thought people
were depraved back then...

344
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,080
I mean, his head'd nearly burst...

345
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,989
if he saw how wicked
this country's become.

346
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,062
I hate the wickedness of America...

347
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,664
and all the sin-worshippers
who populate it.

348
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,496
"Do I not hate them, O Lord,
that hate thee?"

349
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,160
Says in Psalms 138...

350
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,865
"Am I not grieved by those
that rise up against thee?

351
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,942
I hate them with a perfect hatred.

352
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,035
I count them mine enemies. "

353
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,910
Twenty-one, 22.

354
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:28,316
And who's the greatest enemy
of God, Cheyenne?

355
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,388
- Satan.
- Satan.

356
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,052
- That's right, baby.
- Satan.

357
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,151
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,163
And who's Satan's instrument
on earth, Fiona May?

359
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,630
The homosexuals.

360
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,396
That's right, baby. The homosexuals.

361
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,739
The homosexuals have run amok
in this nation over 30 years now.

362
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,641
Let's see what it's brought us.

363
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,975
Rampant fornication...

364
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,550
adultery...

365
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,517
abortion...

366
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,485
flagrant sexuality...

367
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,115
in every corner of media...
movies, TV, et cetera.

368
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,716
Schools, malls, books...

369
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,855
clothes, toys, music...

370
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,694
Everywhere.

371
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,598
Everywhere!

372
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:22,163
You can't turn on the TV without seeing
some jackass waving' his privates.

373
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,310
That's because the moral spine
of this country has been weakened...

374
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,744
by permissive attitudes...

375
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,545
and an unabashed tolerance
for homosexuals.

376
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,620
Godlessness.

377
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,047
Godlessness.

378
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,419
The casual acceptance of the gay...

379
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,393
has hastened our demise as a species.

380
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:49,365
Fact. Why? Because they do not procreate.

381
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,766
They do not procreate.

382
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,966
Now, they solicit. Yeah, boy.

383
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,564
They recruit.

384
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,143
Yeah, boy.

385
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,873
But they do not procreate.

386
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,107
Is there anyone...

387
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,616
anyone... who can look at the news...

388
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,779
and deny these are our end times?

389
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,791
Outside our fence lays a world at waste.

390
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,294
They's famine, such as in Africa...

391
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,367
pestilence, such as the gay Al DS.

392
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:29,469
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes
and the ensuing floods, such as New Orleans...

393
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,099
New Orleans is number one sin city.

394
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,644
Thailand... Thailand!

395
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,974
Thailand...

396
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,315
where pederasts travel
thousands of miles...

397
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,049
spend untold amounts of money...

398
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,691
to sodomize a child.

399
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,628
A baby.

400
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:01,098
Thousands upon thousands
dead in that tsunami.

401
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,609
I never saw the hand of God
so clearly in all my born days.

402
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,608
And the Lord's bore witness
to this apostasy.

403
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,910
Apostasy... The leaving of faith,
the denying of religion...

404
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,987
denying of morality.

405
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,089
He's done with it.

406
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,725
He's done with it.

407
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,819
The end is nigh.

408
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,898
- The end is nigh.
- Yes, it is.

409
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,960
Cheyenne, bunny rabbit...

410
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,637
do you mind taking
the children out now for the lesson...

411
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,871
'cause it's going to get grown up in here.

412
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,572
You ready?

413
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,912
Come on, babies. Grandpa loves you.

414
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,507
Come on.

415
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,746
Gimme your hand there. Come on.

416
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,982
Come here. Come on, sweetie.

417
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,456
When you get finished today in school...

418
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
I want you to tell me
all about it, will ya?

419
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,625
Will you tell me about it later?

420
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,197
I wish you'd talk to me sometime.

421
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,944
Would y'all like to see
who we have to thank...

422
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,983
for the extinction of the human race?

423
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,510
It.

424
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,520
Y'all know about that Worldwide Web.

425
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,694
Yeah, that's the devil's playground.

426
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,129
We harnessed the devils' technology...

427
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,396
went out like sheep amongst wolves...

428
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,768
into them homosexually oriented
chat rooms...

429
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,703
and we promised them boys
what they wanted to hear.

430
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,237
Just like an insect...

431
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:54,952
just like moths to a flame,
like flies to horseshit.

432
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,952
Insects. Insects...

433
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,082
that are easily trapped
in that snare of God...

434
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,092
on that there Web.

435
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,789
And we going to deal with 'em
the way God taught us to deal with 'em...

436
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,799
the way we dealt
with little Jacob Harlow...

437
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,529
who burns in hell as we speak.

438
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,273
Now...

439
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,272
there's a commandment
talks against killing', isn't it?

440
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,372
There's a commandment
speaks against killing'.

441
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,451
God's talking about your fellow man.

442
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,112
He's not talking about this... insect.

443
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:34,123
I mean, you don't mourn the death
of a germ when it's been cured.

444
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,990
And a homosexual...

445
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,427
won't stop sinning' of its own volition...

446
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:44,127
and it's up to the righteous
to curb the spread of its disease.

447
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,329
"If a man also lie with mankind...

448
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,202
as he lies with a woman...

449
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,605
they both have committed an abomination...

450
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,804
and they shall surely be put to death. "

451
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,508
- That is the scripture.
- No. No!

452
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,643
That is scripture.

453
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,122
Well, the wrath of God...

454
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,025
is revealed from heaven...

455
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,322
against all ungodliness.

456
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,230
No! Please, help!

457
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,802
Help!

458
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,039
Now tape him up good, boys.
Now you watch that gay saliva.

459
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,840
If it gets on ya, it can turn ya.

460
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,882
Don't get it near his orifices, now.

461
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,386
- Shut up!
- Send the sinner straight to hell.

462
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,356
Come on, baby.
Send the sinner straight to hell.

463
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,755
Shut your mouth!

464
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,192
Send him off wrapped like a package.

465
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,345
Come on, Caleb.

466
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,287
Burn in hell, cocksucker.

467
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,721
No!

468
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,090
Caleb, head hole.

469
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,605
Let us out of here!
We didn't do anything!

470
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,470
Let us the fuck out of here!

471
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,065
Oh, man!

472
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,734
Let us out! Let us out of here, please!

473
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,611
All right. Get that other one.

474
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,047
Oh, fuck.

475
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,311
Oh, God. I isn’t gay! Please!

476
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,182
Don't! No! No!

477
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,119
No, look, I isn’t even gay!

478
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,918
Please, no! No!

479
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,118
Please! I isn’t even gay!

480
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,957
I isn’t even gay. I isn’t even gay!

481
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,496
Please!

482
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,793
Stop. I isn’t even gay! Please!

483
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,458
Let me go! Please!

484
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,970
- Jarod!
- Travis! Billy-Ray!

485
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,668
What the fuck are you doing? God!

486
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,245
- Take it easy, kid.
- I isn’t even gay! I isn’t even gay!

487
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,904
You might be worse.

488
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,610
Came to these woods to share a woman
with other men in the same bed.

489
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,778
Will somebody please fucking' help me!

490
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:22,690
Fornicating' ways, they caused the destruction
of both Sodom and Gomorrah.

491
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,284
I don't want to die!

492
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,090
You already did, sinner.

493
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,256
You destroyed your spirit...

494
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,857
in a waste of shame.

495
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,157
Hey, Billy-Ray.

496
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,327
Fuck.

497
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,028
Hey, Billy-Ray.

498
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,538
They going to do us like they did that guy.

499
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,411
Not if we can get outta here first, man.

500
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,576
- They going to kill us!
- Listen. Listen to me.

501
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,985
I think a bone snapped out of this dead guy's
skin when they dropped him...

502
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,751
because I feel something stabbing my leg.

503
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,419
What the fuck, man? What the fuck?

504
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,691
I think I can fucking'
tear through this paper...

505
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,527
if you can just fucking'
lean back a little bit.

506
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,362
Just work with me here a little bit.

507
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,935
Just tell me what I got to do.

508
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,200
Lean back a little bit
so I can lean forward. Just work with me.

509
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,070
Oh, no. No.

510
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,870
Really, no. Fucking' lean into me, man.

511
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,842
Do you want to fucking' die?
Do you want to fucking' die?

512
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,005
Then fucking' listen to me
and we'll go home, all right?

513
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,514
Stop being a fucking' baby
and let's fucking get outta here, man.

514
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,915
Just lean back a little bit.

515
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,509
All right?

516
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:01,422
Just relax and lean back
just a little bit so I can lean forward.

517
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,222
If I can get the bone on the thing...

518
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,887
Just can't see straight.

519
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,624
Hurry, Trav.

520
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,061
It's only tape, man.

521
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,969
I just want my mom.
I really want my mom.

522
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,446
Oh, you can't do it.

523
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,686
Electronic gate.
It's got one of them magnetic locks on it.

524
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,258
- That's why I couldn't...
- Yeah.

525
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,264
I'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor.

526
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,958
That's all right.

527
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,594
You're a man of the law.
What can I do for you, Officer?

528
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,831
I'm following up on a report
of a traffic accident.

529
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,398
Station wagon sideswiped a car
out on Route 9.

530
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,138
Oh, my Lord. Anybody hurt?

531
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,647
No, sir. There was no one
in the car at the time...

532
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,414
but I see you got a wagon over there
with some damage...

533
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,921
that matches the description.

534
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,991
Fuck!

535
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,583
Oh, fuck. I'm free. I'm free.

536
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,662
I'm free.

537
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,325
- I tell 'em and I tell 'em and I tell 'em.
- Sir?

538
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,700
That's my granddaughters'.

539
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,968
Once in a while they go into town,
you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.

540
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,772
Whatever. I believe they're your culprits.

541
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,370
You know, it's not
politically correct to say...

542
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,642
but women and cars...

543
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,218
Not a good mix.

544
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,727
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- Oh, fuck!

545
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,530
Go.

546
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,796
Go, man! Hurry!

547
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,342
It's too fucking' tight, Trav.

548
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,173
I can't fucking' do it. It's too tight.

549
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,247
Billy-Ray! Where are you going'?

550
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,839
Billy-Ray, don't fucking' go.
Where the fuck are you going'?

551
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,417
I can't fucking' do it!

552
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,148
I'm sorry!

553
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,246
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:17,055
If I could, I'd like to keep
the insurance devils out of it.

555
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,527
You know, rates are high as it is...

556
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,031
and I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity around here.

557
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,101
Well, no, I guess not.

558
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,763
So if you can put me in touch
with whoever it is, you know...

559
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:31,308
that owns the car that they scraped up...

560
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,036
why I can talk to 'em personal.

561
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,977
Maybe get him some financial restitution.

562
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,708
Make up for it, you know.

563
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
I mean, if you could.

564
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,955
I mean, there's only cosmetic damage,
you know. Nobody was hurt.

565
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,594
I guess that'd be fine.
I'll just phone it in to y'all in the morning.

566
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,636
I thank you so much for that.
I'm much obliged.

567
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,568
- Hey, you have a good night.
- You too.

568
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,639
Oh, fuck!

569
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,080
Pastor, excuse me.

570
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,206
Sorry. I got one last thing.

571
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:16,082
I remember you went over to the Vatican
to protest that dead pope's funeral...

572
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,950
a few years back.

573
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,820
And I guess what I'm saying is...

574
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,619
is Italy nice?

575
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,105
Oh, my God.

576
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,676
- Italy?
- Yeah.

577
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,375
I was thinking about taking my wife
someplace exotic for our five-year...

578
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,942
and, well, Italy was at the top of the list.

579
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,023
Well, it's full of Italians.
There is that.

580
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,319
Full of Italians, huh?

581
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,418
Yeah, I suppose that stands to reason.

582
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,089
- All right, you have a good night.
- Thank you.

583
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,494
Oh, fuck.

584
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,002
Let's fucking' do this!

585
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,227
Motherfucker.

586
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,820
Sheriff, I got shots fired
inside of Five Points. Repeat. I have...

587
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,398
Shots fired.

588
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,333
Repeat, shots fired inside of Five Points.

589
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,496
Wait a minute. In Cooper's church?

590
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,198
Immediate backup requested.

591
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,901
- Repeat, immediate backup requested.
- I got him, Daddy.

592
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,739
Jesus.

593
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,415
Pete!

594
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,508
Was that a gunshot, Pete?

595
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,416
Pete, you still there?

596
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,150
Pete!

597
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:04,160
Is this that obese queer,
likes to sodomize wetbacks out on Route 9?

598
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,394
Who is this? Where's my deputy?

599
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,233
Yeah, God sees all, Mr. Queer.

600
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,569
God takes pictures too...

601
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,075
unseemly photographs of men on men...

602
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,511
backwards, sweaty,
lust-filled carnal knowledge.

603
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,879
That fun for you, Mr. Queer...

604
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:30,784
have a man in your mouth not a mile
from my house of worship?

605
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:35,120
Now, there was some
unpleasantness out here tonight.

606
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,818
You just let us clean it up...

607
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,022
and I won't send
any pictures of you to the missus...

608
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,598
or the Courier...

609
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,894
those images of how you like
to use that mouth.

610
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,698
And I don't means stuffing' it
with Moon Pies and Coca-Cola.

611
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,272
I tell you what.

612
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,137
What about that picture of you
wiping the faces of that wetback...

613
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,972
off of your scrotum and genitalia?

614
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,739
I think the missus would like that one.

615
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,677
She'd put it on the mantel
at Christmastime...

616
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,250
right between them two stockings.

617
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,220
Yeah, you keep your queer hole shut,
Sheriff...

618
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,383
everything going to be just fine.

619
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,125
What happened in there?

620
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,963
The kids was cutting'
themselves loose downstairs.

621
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,061
Caleb went to deal with it.

622
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,573
Shooting' 'em up while I'm out there
with this law dog.

623
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,235
You want me to move his car
on the property?

624
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,547
No.

625
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,116
Take him on across town.

626
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,311
Other side of the tracks,
dump him off there.

627
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,379
The Feds get rather investigative
when it comes to killing' one of their own.

628
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,364
Hello?

629
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,933
This is Keenan.

630
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,096
I'm sorry. Who now?

631
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,540
Yes, sir.

632
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,405
That case is under
preliminary investigation.

633
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:42,443
Report was members of the church
were seeking semiautomatic firearms...

634
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:46,216
mid-2004, before AWB expired.

635
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,122
We have unconfirmed reports
they got a few.

636
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,897
Well, the intelligence suggests
that they were modifying the weapons.

637
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,199
At least that was the testimony
of the guy who sold 'em some shotguns.

638
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,741
He said they made inquiries
about modifications.

639
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,477
No, sir. Undercover infiltration
was unsuccessful.

640
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,048
Can you...

641
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,317
I'm sorry. Sir?

642
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,047
Can I call you back?

643
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,081
Yes, sir. Thank you.
It'll just be a few minutes.

644
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,427
Oh, shit.

645
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,268
If you loved me,
you'd make me some coffee.

646
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,607
Caleb?

647
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,841
Darling'?

648
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,085
Oh, no!

649
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,452
No, Caleb!

650
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,584
Come on, baby doll. Come on.

651
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,185
Come on. Come on.

652
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,730
I know. I know, baby. I know.

653
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,257
Timothy 4, baby doll.

654
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,835
Timothy 4.

655
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,939
Timothy 4, baby. Timothy 4.

656
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,066
"I am now ready to be offered.

657
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:17,011
The time for my departure is at hand.

658
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,275
I have fought a good fight.

659
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,817
I have fought a good fight.

660
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,946
I have finished my course.

661
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,785
I have kept the faith. "

662
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,029
He's on the loving' breast of Jesus, baby.

663
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,366
He's gone to Jesus.

664
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,502
I know, baby. I know. I know.

665
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,071
Come on.

666
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,800
Let me show you something, sweetie.

667
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,842
Let me show you something. Come on.

668
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,212
I want you to see something with me now.

669
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,439
- Lookee here.
- What?

670
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,140
Lookee here.

671
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,308
Caleb did not die in vain.

672
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,216
He sent them two devils to hell
before they killed him.

673
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,957
Probably saved us all
with his last dying' breath.

674
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,831
You go rot in hell, you filthy, filthy...

675
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,839
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

676
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,772
Come on. We got one upstairs.

677
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,503
Save it for him.

678
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,308
- Save it for him. Am I right?
- Oh, Daddy, you're always right.

679
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,747
There's a land

680
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,480
Beyond the river

681
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,681
That they call

682
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,726
The sweet forever

683
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,957
And you only reach that shore

684
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,865
By fate's decree

685
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:50,908
By and by we'll cross the portal

686
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:57,140
Where we'll dwell with thee, immortal

687
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:01,014
When they ring those golden bells

688
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,053
They're a pretty tight-knit group.

689
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:08,648
Approximately 20, 25 members...

690
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,092
all related by blood or marriage.

691
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:17,327
Makes it impossible
to get any coverts inside.

692
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,231
No, sir.

693
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:23,102
You're thinking of Fred Phelps
and his family up in Kansas.

694
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,767
"God hates fags. "

695
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,039
They're irritating,
but they're not gun nuts like the Coopers.

696
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,950
They're suers, not doers.

697
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,679
Last April someone at Five Points...

698
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,917
reported an I ED setup
on church property.

699
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,222
No injuries sustained
and minimal damage done to a tree...

700
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,888
but in an interview
with the local media...

701
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:51,229
Cooper claimed that if a bomb had gone off
in a synagogue, a black church...

702
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,826
or a homo-friendly Unitarian coven...

703
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,269
there'd have been an uproar.

704
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,363
No suspects, no arrests.

705
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,466
Local law enforcement
chalked it up to townie kids...

706
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,637
having fun at the church's expense.

707
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,773
But it spooked the Coopers into tearing down
all the barns on their property...

708
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,444
turning 'em into barricade fences.

709
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,181
Locals call it "the great wall of bullshit. "

710
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,253
Yes, sir, after the one in China.

711
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,389
What made 'em persons of interest...

712
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:24,831
was an interview Cooper gave
to the Patriot Times right about then.

713
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,369
He said that
"If the law won't protect us...

714
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,735
from the Philistines and sodomites...

715
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,705
we'll protect ourselves. "

716
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:35,438
You couple that comment
with the allegations, and you can see why...

717
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,412
We've had 'em on surveillance off and on.

718
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,108
They're pretty easy to keep track of.

719
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,652
When they're not protesting gay bars
or chasing headlines...

720
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,779
they mostly stick to their compound...

721
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,516
hold their daily services.

722
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,163
I know I'm low man
on the totem pole...

723
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,792
but are you sure that's wise
at this juncture, sir?

724
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,200
Why? Because if you give us
a few more days...

725
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,767
I'm sure we can dig up something
more substantial than the sheriff's...

726
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,408
That's how you want to play it.

727
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,215
No, sir, I'm not questioning
your call at all, sir.

728
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,281
I'm saying that our history with
situations like this hasn't been exactly...

729
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,395
Yes, sir. It's dawn here now...

730
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,369
but we can be fully mobilized
and on site in an hour.

731
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,473
I understand.

732
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,548
Tempted and tried

733
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,314
We're oft made to wonder

734
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:28,152
Why it should be

735
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,386
All the day long

736
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:36,455
While there are others

737
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,094
Living about us

738
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,696
Never molested

739
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,402
Doing wrong

740
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,711
When death has come

741
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:55,444
And taken our loved one

742
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:59,249
It makes our hearts

743
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:03,417
So weary and drear

744
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:08,594
Then do we wonder

745
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,533
Why others prosper

746
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:16,970
Living so wicked

747
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:21,443
Year after year

748
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:27,711
Farther along we'll know all about it

749
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,923
Farther along we'll understand why

750
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:40,486
Cheer up, my brother

751
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:44,055
Live in the sunshine

752
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:49,629
We'll understand it all by and by

753
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,731
Come, sweetie. Come. Come.

754
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,277
Farther along

755
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,749
We'll know all about it

756
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:06,955
Farther along
we'll understand why

757
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:27,207
All by and by

758
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,731
Fuck!

759
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,032
Fast little monkey!

760
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,055
Who fired? Who fired, goddamn it!

761
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,491
Local Agent 3.

762
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,334
Goddamn it!

763
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,630
- What are you...
- Who the fuck are you?

764
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,433
Did he fire at us?

765
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,769
- No, he was armed.
- Did he open fire at us?

766
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,241
- Son of a bitch had a machine gun!
- They got kids in there, asshole!

767
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,108
- Sorry! I'm sorry.
- Kids you just turned into hostages!

768
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,579
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Asshole!

769
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:42,015
You can't talk to me, you son of a bitch.
I am a King's County elected official!

770
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,213
Sit your ass back in your vehicle!

771
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:47,790
Now!

772
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,307
How much you think
across like that costs?

773
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,215
You mean in dollars or common sense?

774
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,046
Zing!

775
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,818
We get the spike mic set up?

776
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:27,328
Well, we were about to,
and then Barney Fife happened.

777
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,297
Well...

778
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,801
Let's go old-school.
We get any blueprints or whatnot?

779
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,700
- 1922.
- It's all county had.

780
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:44,247
They haven't built an addition to the original
structure for the last 50 years. No permits.

781
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:48,079
They got anything on four legs except horses
we got to look out for?

782
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,415
Isn't this a stable?

783
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,488
No, that's Home Depot.

784
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,718
It was a stud farm. Belonged
to the last neighbours the Coopers ever had...

785
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,886
before Abin drove 'em off
and bought the land.

786
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,763
That's where they load up with all the lumber
so they can build this elegant fucking fence.

787
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:08,566
Million-dollar views from three directions
and then, bam! "Casa de Bat Shit. "

788
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,835
Do you know how you get
a valley this beautiful all to yourself?

789
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,002
Put a giant fucking cross
on your front lawn.

790
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,739
Give me the horn.

791
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,754
This is Special Agent
Joseph Keenan of the ATF.

792
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,652
We're here to execute
a search warrant on the premises...

793
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,697
on suspicion of violation
of the National Firearms Act.

794
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:40,236
Put down any weapons, come out with
your hands up, and you will not be harmed.

795
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:44,364
Repeat: You will not be harmed.

796
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,414
I think it's the use of the word "repeat"
that makes this work every time.

797
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,665
You want to breach?

798
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:23,977
No.

799
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,615
Give 'em a minute.

800
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,245
Get a line opened up.

801
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,347
Yeah, that's going to...

802
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,095
Come on!

803
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,860
Goddamn it!

804
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,662
Get down! Agent, get down!

805
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:55,845
Right now!

806
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,706
This is Special Agent Keenan, sir.

807
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,944
Cooper's Dell has escalated
into a fire fight.

808
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:05,021
Requesting backup.

809
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,215
Get the fuck outta here. Go grab a rifle.

810
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,383
The local sheriff shot
and killed an armed assailant.

811
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:14,987
We C-C'd. They opened fire.

812
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,998
They shot Brooks.

813
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,590
The fucking church people!

814
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,367
They're heavy with AK's and TECs.

815
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,962
I need backup now!

816
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,841
You said this was going to be
a simple in-and-out, sir.

817
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,649
Simple just shit itself.

818
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,554
Media, sir?

819
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,255
The closest TV station's
a hundred miles away.

820
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,056
The local paper prints once a week.

821
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,824
Media's not a factor, sir.

822
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,472
Sir, that sounds like...

823
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,374
With all due respect, sir...

824
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:04,606
maybe we should get the deputy
assistant director on this call.

825
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,942
Jesus Christ, there's kids in there, sir!

826
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,747
Just give me another 10 minutes.
I can open up a line...

827
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,852
I'm going to want something in writing
to protect myself and my field office.

828
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,761
No, I'm going to need something more
substantial than your word for this.

829
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,998
Either I get a text,
or an e-mail, or something official...

830
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,370
I can stand behind or it's no-go.

831
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,147
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

832
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,591
Down! Who else
is coming out that door, huh?

833
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,594
- It's just me.
- Bullshit!

834
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,823
There's kids in there
and I want to get 'em out.

835
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:08,638
Is that Group 2?
Are they sending us more agents?

836
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,043
The situation's been reclassified.

837
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,774
We're to take down
this domestic terrorist cell.

838
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,250
- We fired on them first, Joe.
- We didn't.

839
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,345
That fat fucking asshole local.

840
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:21,790
What are the orders?

841
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,153
Hold on a second. We don't even know
what the goddamn situation is in there.

842
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,563
Our Intel is limited. We've had
no fucking communication with them!

843
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,828
"Our investigation
of the Five Point Church...

844
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,837
at Cooper's Dell
has uncovered an extremely hostile...

845
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,669
domestic terrorist cell, heavily armed...

846
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,710
with intentions of bombing
a local shopping mall this morning. "

847
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,278
You're fucking kidding me!

848
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,541
"When we came with arrest warrants,
they opened fire on us...

849
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,844
killing the assistant
special agent in charge...

850
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,717
leaving us no choice but to take
the premises with deadly force. "

851
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,819
Jesus Christ.

852
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,950
There are women,
and there are kids inside there, man.

853
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,929
"In the resulting fire fight,
all suspects were killed. "

854
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,027
Give 'em the gas, then dynamic entry.

855
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,072
Joe, the suits isn’t here.

856
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,069
We're here, Joe.
You're here. You can call this.

857
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,476
And then what, Harry?

858
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,810
The FBI takes over,
and we look like assholes...

859
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,043
who can't do our jobs... again.

860
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,019
That's what happens the minute
a single news van rolls up...

861
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,885
and any one of these people
walks out of there alive...

862
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,892
goes on CNN and says we're the bad guys.

863
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,758
Doesn't matter who the fuck's around
to tell it to the goddamn news.

864
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,060
That's exactly what we're going to be...
the fucking bad guys!

865
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,135
I got 18 years in.

866
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,795
I'm not telling my wife she's got to
clip coupons till we're dead...

867
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,840
'cause I couldn't follow a simple order,
shitty as that order is.

868
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,909
And we're not talking about Gandhi here.

869
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,205
I got a piece of Brooks’ skull
in my fucking knee.

870
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,371
They're shooting at us
with military ordnance.

871
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,642
These isn’t a bunch of tweakers
in a motel meth lab.

872
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,445
They are big bad eggs.

873
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,186
Get your men ready for a breach.

874
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,689
Sir, I've apprehended one of the suspects.

875
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,261
Unarmed girl, early 20s.

876
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,854
She's says she's the caretaker
of the kids in the house.

877
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,867
She says she wants to get the kids
out the back without her people knowing.

878
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,436
I think she's legit, sir.

879
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,402
Requesting instructions. Over.

880
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,071
This is a hostile domestic terrorist cell.

881
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,738
Use of deadly force is permitted.

882
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,916
- She's not even armed. Over.
- We're not terrorists.

883
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,351
Those are your goddamn orders.

884
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,850
It's the wrong move, Joe.

885
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,559
We're not terrorists.
We're not. You can't do this. Please.

886
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,936
- No! We're not terrorists!
- Stay back! Stay back!

887
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:56,102
Please, don't! Please! Oh, God.

888
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,077
You need to take this gun
and go back to the house, ma'am.

889
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,018
- Run back to the house.
- I don't want it.

890
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,749
Take the gun and head back
into the house!

891
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:08,881
No! You're going to shoot me!

892
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,153
Take the fucking gun, bitch,
and go to the house!

893
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,161
No! Oh, God!

894
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,396
Get in there!

895
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,000
Your daddy's dead.

896
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,699
This is how you respect his memory?

897
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,870
By trying to run out on your family?

898
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:32,175
No. Mama, they think we're terrorists.
They're going to kill us all.

899
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,977
Good.

900
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,847
Then I'll be in heaven with Caleb.

901
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,148
Isn't that what you want?

902
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,120
To be with your daddy and Jesus?

903
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,352
But, Mama, what about
Melanie and the babies?

904
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,793
Me and the babies, Mama.

905
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,798
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth
to have a thankless child"!

906
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,202
You get down on your knees
and pray for God's forgiveness!

907
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,176
When you get done with that...

908
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:03,336
you take this,
come join your family up front.

909
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,672
Come on, come on.

910
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:18,318
- Like a good Christian.
- Yeah.

911
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,207
They're trying to kill
the children, Daddy.

912
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,436
They're trying to kill us all, baby.

913
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,273
I don't want to live in this world no more.

914
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,748
I want to go to Jesus.

915
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,257
Well, baby...

916
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,826
if you die...

917
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:56,756
fighting an army
of sodomite-protecting idolaters...

918
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,700
I suspect the good Lord's
going to give you a mansion in his kingdom.

919
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,933
You always know what to say
to make me feel better, Daddy.

920
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,570
"Now learn ye the parable of a fig tree. "

921
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,783
Yes.

922
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,352
Such as Matthew 24.

923
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,785
"When his branch is yet tender...

924
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,288
and putteth forth leaves...

925
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,288
know that summer is nigh. "

926
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:26,795
Well, baby...

927
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,896
looks like summer's about as nigh
as it ever going to get.

928
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,632
Let's go.

929
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,966
I shall see the face of the Lord...

930
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,539
and the Lord's glory shall surely...

931
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,883
You're going to be quiet, okay?

932
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,649
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

933
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,354
Okay?

934
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,520
Okay.

935
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,197
Are Travis and Billy-Ray dead?

936
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:00,982
So what? You going to fucking kill me?

937
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,717
If you help me, I won't.

938
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,055
Else I will, I swear.

939
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,968
There's government agents outside...

940
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,438
and they want to come in here
and kill my family.

941
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,168
- Fucking good!
- Will you shut up?

942
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,369
I'm trying to save your life.

943
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,708
Those government people...
they're going to kill you too.

944
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,651
They already shot your friend...

945
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,222
and they are going to kill everyone
in this house...

946
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,723
'cause they screwed up
what they came here to do.

947
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,785
They're going to kill us
so that we can't tell on 'em.

948
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,089
They don't want any witnesses...

949
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,967
so they're going to bust in here
and shoot all of us...

950
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:52,803
even my little brothers
and my sister and my cousins.

951
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:56,403
But I can't let the babies get killed.

952
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,605
I've done some bad things.

953
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,014
But if I let them babies get killed...

954
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,783
They don't know what
we've been up to in here.

955
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,192
If they did, they could just arrest us.

956
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,162
They could put us on trial...

957
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:20,497
and then the Zionist media
would make heroes out of 'em.

958
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:23,071
But they are going to need witnesses...

959
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,436
and that's you.

960
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,437
That's you.

961
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:34,805
So, if you and me...

962
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,683
we can get out there
without getting' killed...

963
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,780
we can tell 'em
what's really going' on in the chapel.

964
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:45,088
We do that, and they can't
kill the babies.

965
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,139
Sara, baby.

966
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,436
Gimme some sweet tea, will you?

967
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,886
- You want me to save your life?
- No, no.

968
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,966
You want me to save your life?

969
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,403
You killed my fucking friends.

970
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:34,169
It's not me I care about
so much as I care about the kids.

971
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:39,875
My cousin's kid isn’t
but three years old and my little sis...

972
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:46,145
My little sister's only eight.

973
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,396
Fuck you.

974
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,867
You think they're going to believe
that you weren't one of us?

975
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,997
They won't even give you the chance
to tell 'em before they put one in your head.

976
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:10,602
'Cause once they get inside here
that is exactly what they're going to do.

977
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,073
You think I give a shit?

978
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,178
Fuck you...

979
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,052
and you’re stupid family.

980
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:25,321
My two best friends are fucking dead.

981
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:28,192
So you know what?
Why don't you just go on and kill me too?

982
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:31,698
You can take that gun
and just fucking kill me too.

983
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,462
Just put a bullet in my fucking head...

984
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:37,130
because that's what I've been waiting for
since you tied me to a fucking cross!

985
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,335
Cheyenne!

986
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,144
Please.

987
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:46,381
Yeah, I bet Billy-Ray said please too.

988
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,141
And they still killed him.

989
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,884
So fuck you.

990
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,116
And if you want to save
your precious fucking babies...

991
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,749
why don't you suck a fucking rescue
outta my dick, bitch?

992
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,995
What?

993
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,122
You get away from her, you heathen!

994
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,894
- Get the fuck off me!
- You!

995
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:08,436
Mama, please! Mama, stop it!

996
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,563
- Mama, please! Mama!
- Get off!

997
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,606
- You damn heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!

998
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,475
What are you trying to do to her?

999
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,448
Trying to get what you came for?
What did you do to my girl?

1000
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,676
Mama!

1001
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,177
What's the matter with you, girl?

1002
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,615
What's got over you?

1003
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:33,092
Will you put that gun down?
His friends killed your daddy.

1004
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,459
If we just confess,
they can't kill the babies.

1005
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,022
No, don't go anywhere!

1006
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,900
There's men outside
and they aim to kill us.

1007
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,468
So you take everybody
up to the attic, okay?

1008
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,845
You barricade the door. Okay?

1009
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,542
What'd you do?

1010
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,246
You do it!
You get 'em up there, goddamn it!

1011
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,153
- You do it right now!
- What did you do, Cheyenne?

1012
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,420
- Go!
- Mama!

1013
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,995
Mommy! Mommy!

1014
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,224
Is Mama dead?

1015
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:50,805
Listen.

1016
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:57,640
You go on with Maggie
and the other kids upstairs now, okay?

1017
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:01,945
You go up to the attic
and you stay there until I come get you.

1018
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:06,886
You don't open that door for nobody else
but me, okay? You understand?

1019
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,283
Okay, you go on now.

1020
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,859
Quick, like a bunny.

1021
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,038
Stevie, go!

1022
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,204
Go, go, go!

1023
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,122
Cocksuckers!

1024
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:11,781
Mordechai!

1025
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,152
Top of the crown! Top of the crown!

1026
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,032
The Lord is our shepherd.

1027
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,963
The Lord is my shepherd.

1028
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,737
Team, get ready to flank!

1029
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,091
No!

1030
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:05,199
- Freeze! Drop your weapon!
- Look, don't shoot. I'm a hostage, okay?

1031
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,532
- We need to talk to who's in charge.
- Drop the fucking gun!

1032
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:10,605
You don't have to do this.

1033
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,968
Get back.

1034
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,599
There's enough evidence
to put us all away for life.

1035
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,143
- Don't move!
- Get back, all right?

1036
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,736
There's babies in the attic!

1037
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,018
No!

1038
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,156
You all right?

1039
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,096
What the fuck was that?

1040
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,355
Yes, sir!

1041
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:11,194
Yes, sir! He's calling us home!

1042
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,824
Come on, come on!

1043
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:16,427
Come on, children! Come on!

1044
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:23,503
Everywhere, everywhere

1045
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,670
Drop the artillery!

1046
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,036
There be no need for that anymore.

1047
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,235
Where's that sound coming from?

1048
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,642
"And the four angels were loosed...

1049
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:01,773
which were prepared
for an hour and a day...

1050
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:04,375
and a month and a year...

1051
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,852
to slay a third of men. "

1052
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,052
Hear ye!

1053
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,095
His sacred call to arms!

1054
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:17,688
The heavenly trumpets sound his name!

1055
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,428
The one true God comes to rapture!

1056
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:23,096
His faithful slay the wicked...

1057
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:27,539
and send this evil world straight to hell!

1058
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,239
Enough! Enough, goddamn it! Enough!

1059
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,612
Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute, everybody.

1060
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,913
No more fire and brimstone, preacher!

1061
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,185
What does that sound mean?

1062
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,021
Well, boy...

1063
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,728
there isn’t nothing left
but fire and brimstone.

1064
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,800
Can't you hear?

1065
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:54,892
Can't you hear?

1066
01:12:57,172 --> 01:13:00,232
This is the Lord's day of judgment.

1067
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,671
Four trumpet blasts.

1068
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,804
The seals have been opened...

1069
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,576
and the horsemen dispatched.

1070
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,652
Three more blasts...

1071
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:16,214
and he closes the book
on this wicked, wicked world!

1072
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,590
- Praise His name!
- Praise His name!

1073
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,219
So come on!

1074
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:24,131
Come on, G-man.

1075
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,932
"G" for "Godless. "

1076
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,094
"G" for "government. "

1077
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,899
Come on.

1078
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:32,906
Come on. Shoot me.

1079
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,442
Shoot me, you bootlicking...

1080
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:39,173
flag-worshipping heathen!

1081
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:43,342
Shoot me!
It only hastens my reward in eternity.

1082
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:47,786
Shoot me! Shoot me!

1083
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,155
And then what happened?

1084
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,360
Special Agent Keenan?

1085
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,361
Special Agent Keenan?

1086
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,939
What happened?

1087
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,743
I subdued the suspect...

1088
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,437
with a head butt.

1089
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,710
- A head butt?
- Yes, sir. The suspect was standing...

1090
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,845
unnaturally close.

1091
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:24,058
And then the trumpet blast sounded
three more times, and a fourth and a fifth.

1092
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,593
By then it was pretty clear
the rapture wasn't going to happen.

1093
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:30,825
So we rounded up
the remaining Five Pointers.

1094
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,560
On the record, Agent Keenan...

1095
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:35,068
this inquiry commends you
for peaceably containing...

1096
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,001
a potentially explosive situation.

1097
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,573
But, off the record...

1098
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,473
you disobeyed a direct order
from a superior, Joe.

1099
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,640
I did.

1100
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:49,979
And I have no excuse
that's going to mean anything here.

1101
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,551
Yeah. Yeah.

1102
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,834
Well, it is the finding of this inquiry...

1103
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,000
that Special Agent
Joseph Keenan be relieved...

1104
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,578
as head of Field Office 263.

1105
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,341
He's to be placed
on one-week leave without pay...

1106
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,246
after which time he'll report
to the Washington office...

1107
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,751
for reassignment in the District.

1108
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,422
I'm getting promoted?

1109
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,653
You're still going to kill him.

1110
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:37,163
The United States government
doesn't kill people, Agent Keenan...

1111
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,234
in or out of custody.

1112
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,337
Of course we're going to kill him, Joe.

1113
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,909
We're going to kill him with kindness.

1114
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:52,208
- You're going to let him go to trial?
- Oh, come on.

1115
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:55,442
- What is this, September 10, 2001?
- Patriot Act, bitch.

1116
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,645
We can plant him forever, okay?
Without a trial.

1117
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:01,917
Never show him the light of day,
let alone a TV camera or a microphone.

1118
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,048
How...

1119
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,388
What do you think
we've been doing the last 10 years?

1120
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,486
Yeah. It's terrorism, Joe. Okay?

1121
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:12,328
If you kill an American because
of a religious belief, you are a terrorist...

1122
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:14,732
and terrorists get locked the fuck up.

1123
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,930
If it's all so easy
to put these people away for life...

1124
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,837
why was I given those orders?

1125
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,568
Truth?

1126
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:27,681
- 'Cause fuck people like this.
- They're animals.

1127
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,410
I mean, don't get me wrong. Jesus saves.

1128
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:33,181
He isn’t going to save Abin Cooper
from a fuck-load of prison rape.

1129
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:36,257
Daily stopping’s by Coke-can cocks.

1130
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,087
Savour that irony, Joe.

1131
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,364
Hey, what was it?

1132
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,232
- The trumpet blast.
- Pardon?

1133
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,032
The trumpet blast... What was it really?

1134
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,038
Oh, that.

1135
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,630
Some new neighbours...

1136
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:57,439
these eco kids from the university
with a compost collective...

1137
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:02,540
they got an acre off the ass end of
the Five Point property, other side of the hill.

1138
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:05,848
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff
because of the smell of the compost.

1139
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,946
- Was it bad?
- Gets so you can taste it.

1140
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:12,550
But Abin's been harassing these kids...

1141
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,458
sending some of his bigger boys over...

1142
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,463
to bitch at first...

1143
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,658
maybe break a window or two.

1144
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,598
Then I guess they went old-school...

1145
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:24,900
Lots of sugar in gas tanks,
burning bags of dog shit.

1146
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,635
- College kids.
- No, that was Cooper and his church.

1147
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,678
The eco kids never so much
as called the cops.

1148
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,337
They...

1149
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,416
They got creative instead.

1150
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:39,317
They thought it'd be funny
to take a page out of Revelations...

1151
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,413
and get Cooper and his family's hopes up
with the trumpets.

1152
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:49,220
So they got this big-ass,
rusty old siren...

1153
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,925
from a firehouse that just got a new one.

1154
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:56,835
The fire chief said they could have
the damn thing as long as they carted it off.

1155
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,701
It's big as a Mini Cooper.

1156
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,901
So they truck this thing down
to their compost collective...

1157
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,776
they put it in a barn,
they hook it up to an iPod of all things...

1158
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:08,349
and they played these
single-note trumpet blasts...

1159
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,281
that they pulled off the Internet.

1160
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,717
And they had no idea
that you were even there.

1161
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,757
It was just dumb luck.

1162
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:27,099
Oh, those eco kids
with the compost collective?

1163
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,895
Turns out it was a cover
for a marijuana grow-house.

1164
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,906
They're being booked right now.

1165
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,476
But considering how
they probably saved a bunch more lives...

1166
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,374
Yeah, yeah. I'll write a letter.

1167
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,804
Yeah.

1168
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,249
Hey, Joe.

1169
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,283
Really...

1170
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,322
why did you shine the direct?

1171
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,994
My grandma on my mother's side...

1172
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,763
she had these two dogs,
pure bloodhounds...

1173
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,196
both came up the same litter.

1174
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:10,404
She kept them
and gave the rest away to the neighbours.

1175
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:13,970
Both known each other
since they had shit in their eyes.

1176
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,643
Neither one ever treated any better
than the other one.

1177
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,244
Gentlest dogs you'd ever care to meet.

1178
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,153
So anyway...

1179
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:27,626
Thanksgiving of my ninth year,
these two old dogs are trailing me around...

1180
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:32,792
'cause they know the score... I'm a
animal lover who never finishes his supper.

1181
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,392
So right before I get up from the table...

1182
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,632
I toss these two old-timers
a turkey leg...

1183
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,605
attached to a hunk of cartilage.

1184
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,770
And it was like they'd never met.

1185
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:48,145
They went at each other so ferociously...

1186
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:52,084
all tooth and claw and jugular...

1187
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,815
They forgot anything
they ever had in common...

1188
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:59,383
and scrapped like that discard
decided between their standing and dying.

1189
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:10,738
People just do the strangest things
when they believe they're entitled.

1190
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:17,600
But they do even stranger things
when they just plain believe.

1191
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,843
I see the face of Jesus

1192
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,044
On my way tonight

1193
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:34,828
He says to me
Old sinner, come on in

1194
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,991
I see the face of Jesus

1195
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:45,071
In that great white light

1196
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,811
And my savoir
makes me whole again

1197
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,785
In his shining eyes...

1198
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:02,014
In his shining eyes...

1199
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,056
I see the promise...

1200
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,198
of all forgiveness that sets you free.

1201
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,800
I see the face of Jesus...

1202
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,672
on my way this night.

1203
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:27,008
And my saviour’s light to comfort me

1204
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:28,878
Shut the fuck up!
