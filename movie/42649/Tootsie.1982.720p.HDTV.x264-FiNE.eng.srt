1
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,816
That's right.
Come on. No, don't stop.

2
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:10,489
Keep looking!

3
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,913
You don't feel so good now, do you?

4
00:01:15,997 --> 00:01:17,998
See, you let it out. Out!

5
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,095
I feel like an idiot.

6
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:31,764
Not so fast, not so fast. Slower.

7
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,515
Slower.

8
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:35,893
Good, good.

9
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:38,896
Keep it specific.

10
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,314
Still a little tension in the mouth.

11
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:43,026
Good, good.

12
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,904
Okay, make her work peripherally.

13
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:52,911
Michael...

14
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:53,996
...Dorsey, is it?

15
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:55,999
Yes, that's right.

16
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,212
Mr. Dorsey, would you turn
to page 23, please?

17
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:03,923
Yes, I believe you mean
the first scene...

18
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,800
Sorry, the second scene
of the first act.

19
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,514
Second scene of the first act. Right.
Begin when you're ready.

20
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,806
Yes, of course.

21
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,524
Oh, sweetheart, do you know what
it was like waking up in Paris...

22
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,319
...seeing the empty pillow where...

23
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:28,200
Wait! Cover your breasts. Kevin is
downstairs! My God, what are you?

24
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,993
I'm a woman. Not Felicia's mother.
Not Kevin's wife.

25
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,623
Thanks very much.
We need someone a little older.

26
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,795
Mom! Dad! Uncle Pete, come quick!

27
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:43,299
Something's wrong with Biscuit!
I think he's dead!

28
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,633
We're looking for someone younger.

29
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:49,930
"They have dinner..." Can I start again?
I didn't get kicked off right.

30
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,100
The reading was fine.
You're the wrong height.

31
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,811
I can be taller.

32
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,314
No. We're looking
for somebody shorter.

33
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,902
Look. I don't have to be this tall.

34
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,030
See, I'm wearing lifts.
I can be shorter.

35
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:07,617
I know, but we're looking
for somebody different.

36
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:08,619
I can be different.

37
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:11,538
We're looking for somebody else.

38
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,623
What do you care more
about than working?

39
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,128
The part's the most important thing.
But love sometimes is too.

40
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,216
With improvisation, you're the writer.
When somebody writes a play...

41
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:26,219
...they decide where the highs are,
where the lows are. Now you do it.

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,515
And you may not be high where
they're high in the writing.

43
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,726
You may not be low where they're low.

44
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,815
You may be high on "but."
You may be high on "and."

45
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,128
Of course, they were doing it
for dough...

46
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,025
...the same as everybody
does it for dough.

47
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,321
But the question is in
the last analysis.

48
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:46,116
What were they doing for dough?

49
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,203
You and me were advancing our
little non-Prussian careers.

50
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,708
So when all hell broke loose,
and the Germans ran out of soap...

51
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,505
...and figured, "What the hell?
Let's cook up Mrs. Greenwald!"...

52
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,717
...who the hell do you
think stopped them?

53
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:11,101
Pardon me, is my acting
interfering with your talking?

54
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,812
Don't play a part that's not in you.

55
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,525
Don't say "he" or "she" like you did
last week when you were doing Kitty.

56
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,112
When you were doing
Time Of Your Life.

57
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:23,532
If you can't make the part yourself,
you can't play it.

58
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:25,534
Sergeant.

59
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:27,201
Quick! Get a priest!

60
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,168
No, sergeant, no priest.

61
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:31,539
- But you're dying, Count Tolstoy.
- I know.

62
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:34,417
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost...

63
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,838
...I commit your soul to God.

64
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:40,924
- My friends...
- That's super, Michael.

65
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:45,930
But I wonder if you could move center
stage on that speech, and then die.

66
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:49,141
Why?

67
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:51,645
The left side of the house
can't see you.

68
00:04:55,815 --> 00:05:00,029
You want me to stand up and walk
to the center of the stage...

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,905
...while I'm dying?

70
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:06,118
I know it's awkward,
but we'll just have to do it.

71
00:05:06,243 --> 00:05:09,330
- Why?
- I just told you. Now do it!

72
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:10,915
Because you say so?

73
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,917
Yes, love.

74
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:15,835
Not with me as Tolstoy.

75
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:18,339
You gotta work.

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,219
There's no excuse for not working.

77
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,513
There's no excuse.
There's unemployment.

78
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:27,140
There was unemployment when
my friends and I started acting.

79
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,516
And it's not changed.

80
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,730
You got 90-95% unemployment.
It's never going to change.

81
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,942
You're an actor.
You're in New York.

82
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,612
There is no work.
But you gotta find ways to work.

83
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,032
Two tortellinis,
a gazpacho with two salads.

84
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:46,119
Ordering: Veal chop, medium,
two scrods, an order of chicken!

85
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:47,913
One scrod underdone.

86
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,332
- What's the rest?
- Baked potato.

87
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,211
- How'd it go?
- Terrible.

88
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:55,129
- Did you rewrite the last scene?
- I did the necktie scene.

89
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,339
How is it?

90
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,050
It'll change theatre as we know it.

91
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,636
We'll work on it
when we get home tonight.

92
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:02,929
That's my flounder.

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,350
- That is my flounder.
- Robber!

94
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,851
- Ordering: One flounder...
- That's for the customer!

95
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:12,314
I eat these things so if the
customers ask if I eat his food...

96
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,318
...I can say, "Yeah, I eat his food."

97
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,740
You rewrote the necktie scene? Good.

98
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:22,325
- Without the necktie?
- With the necktie.

99
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,619
- With the necktie?
- Yeah, with the necktie.

100
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:29,125
The necktie's wrong. You take the
necktie out, you got something.

101
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,337
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

102
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,548
What's wrong is it's depressing
to be disagreed with.

103
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:37,131
It's depression.

104
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:41,136
Today's your birthday,
and you haven't mentioned it.

105
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:45,225
Don't start. I'm a character actor.
Age has no effect on me.

106
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,728
- That's very good.
- How does one not be depressed?

107
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:53,150
Instead of trying to be Michael Dorsey,
the great actor or the great waiter...

108
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,444
...why not just try to be
Michael Dorsey?

109
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:58,155
I am Michael Dorsey.
What's the payoff?

110
00:06:58,446 --> 00:07:02,451
- Say it like you mean it.
- I am Michael Dorsey. Fine. Okay?

111
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:04,828
Surprise!

112
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,547
Speech! Speech! Speech!

113
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,717
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute.

114
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:17,842
First a toast.

115
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:22,223
To Michael Dorsey, who makes you
remember what acting's all about!

116
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,934
Being unemployed!

117
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,228
To Michael...

118
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:30,022
...who's been my friend for six years.

119
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Was it that long?

120
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,443
And who is my coach.
And he's just great.

121
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:38,157
He's a great coach, a great actor.
He's a great guy and...

122
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:40,827
This is a really dumb speech.
Let's get drunk.

123
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:42,827
Happy birthday!

124
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:08,356
- How you doing? Michael.
- Patty.

125
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,941
You an actress? Terrific face.
Nice blouse. Who'd you come with?

126
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,947
I don't want a full house
at the Winter Garden Theatre.

127
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:20,661
I want 90 people who just came out
of the worst rainstorm in history.

128
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:24,749
These are people who are alive
on the planet...

129
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,459
...until they dry off.

130
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:31,130
I wish I had a theatre that
was only open when it rained.

131
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,844
Strasberg said you create
your opportunities.

132
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:38,429
- Uta said that.
- I don't care.

133
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,726
The point is, Sandy and I are raising
$8,000 to do Jeff's play in Syracuse.

134
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,854
We're going to do it.
You could do the same.

135
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,649
Look at Emily!
Look who's here.

136
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,236
You can do it in the Poconos.

137
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:56,239
You're sitting around saying,
"I can't work." Create your own...

138
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:57,741
Isn't she cute?

139
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,328
He loves children.
He really does.

140
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:03,247
You make it!
You find a way to raise it.

141
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:07,044
I was looking at you.
Terrific face. Are you an actress?

142
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,630
- Sometimes.
- You were in Dames At Sea!

143
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,049
- You saw that?
- Good work. Really!

144
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,551
You have a great singing voice.

145
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,846
I felt there was an aura
between us when I saw it.

146
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:19,931
I'm not kidding.
I don't know you, but I know you.

147
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,561
I'll tell you about yourself.
You like to run barefoot on the beach.

148
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:27,565
- Why are you so wired?
- It's my birthday. I'm out of work.

149
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,443
That's it? Nothing more?

150
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:33,654
Yeah, it hurts me. Be the last one
to take your coat tonight. We'll talk.

151
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,366
Fine. All right.

152
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:36,742
Will you? Serious?

153
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,159
Give me a hug.

154
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,247
Thank you for liking me.

155
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,957
I don't like it when people say...

156
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,751
..."I really dug your message, man."

157
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,548
Or, "I really dug your play, man.
I cried."

158
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,257
You know?

159
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,261
I like it when people come up to me...

160
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,763
...the next day...

161
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,349
...or a week later and they say...

162
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,142
..."I saw your play.

163
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,063
What happened?"

164
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:06,858
I've got it under control. I'll feed
my cats and be back in an hour.

165
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:10,154
I can't make it. My roommate
wants to work on the third act.

166
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:13,364
- You can't make it?
- He wants to work.

167
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,866
- Give me your phone number.
- I already did.

168
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,869
- I thought you changed it.
- Since an hour ago?

169
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:22,458
Good point.
Let me talk to him. I'll call you.

170
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,171
- Didn't anybody hear me?
- Guess not.

171
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,547
I've been trapped for half an hour.

172
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,260
What kind of a party is this?

173
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,970
God, you guys are having
a good time, huh?

174
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,262
Sorry.

175
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:39,433
I'll remember that if I ever
do a scene where I'm trapped.

176
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:43,062
- It's nice, Michael.
- Thanks.

177
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,112
Who is that?

178
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:48,943
- Mallory. She's married to John.
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:58,370
I did a thing about suicides
of the American Indian.

180
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,749
And nobody cared. Nobody showed.

181
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:06,171
And I think the American Indian
is as American...

182
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:08,757
...as John and Ethel Barrymore...

183
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:11,135
...and Donny and Marie Osmond.

184
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,137
I think it's really sad...

185
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:16,473
...but I think that, nowadays,
when people dream...

186
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,061
...they don't even dream in their
own country anymore.

187
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,064
And that's sick.

188
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,649
I had a good time.
I just didn't know half the people.

189
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,277
It was late, and I wanted it
to be a surprise.

190
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,071
I invited 10 people.
They all invited 10 people.

191
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,658
You met 40 new people.
They all liked you.

192
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,847
I heard nice things about you.

193
00:11:34,884 --> 00:11:36,453
- Thanks, Jeff.
- Good night.

194
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,539
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

195
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,875
- One of the five people I knew.
- Great party.

196
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,377
Thank you.

197
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,842
Excuse me, Miss Right?
Miss Right?

198
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,061
Good night.
It was a wonderful party.

199
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:03,941
My date left with someone else.
I had fun. Do you have any Seconal?

200
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,942
Come on, I'll take you home.

201
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,448
I did have a good time.
I really did.

202
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,159
You didn't.
Wait. Money for cab fare.

203
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,743
That's okay. It's cheaper to
get mugged. Let's walk.

204
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:17,455
The fares are really
insane now anyway.

205
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:20,750
- Why didn't you have a good time?
- I did have a good time.

206
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,962
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

207
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:24,671
What?

208
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:28,676
- What?
- Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.

209
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,760
I just cry like this, like a tic.

210
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,972
Tell me what's wrong,
or I'll kill you.

211
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:37,269
Nothing's wrong, Michael.
I'm really very up.

212
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,980
You're worried about your audition.
Why?

213
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:43,275
- Because I'm not going to get it.
- Why not?

214
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:47,653
- Because I'm completely wrong for it.
- What kind of a part is it?

215
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,282
A woman!

216
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:52,953
You don't have a man,
so you act like one.

217
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:55,664
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm proud of being a woman.

218
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,583
Wait a minute.
This guy treats you like dirt...

219
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,669
...because he's a big doctor, right?

220
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:03,172
But don't take that.
Talk to him on his level.

221
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:04,756
Show me.

222
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,052
You're doing a Southern accent?

223
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,054
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm very proud of being a woman!

224
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,347
I can't do it as good as you.

225
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:16,059
You can! Just turn the tables
on him. Come on, now.

226
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,063
You're wrong.
I'm proud of being a woman.

227
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:20,236
Where am I off?

228
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:23,985
- I don't know what you're playing.
- I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.

229
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:27,656
You told me to turn the tables.
I'm playing rage.

230
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:28,572
This is rage?

231
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:31,868
I have a problem with anger.

232
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:35,165
You do. But there's 100 other
actresses reading...

233
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:37,667
...who don't, who aren't
afraid of working.

234
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,252
Who aren't afraid to stick
everything on the line and do it!

235
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,880
- Don't get mad!
- Stop being a doormat!

236
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,758
- I'm not a doormat!
- Act right now! Do it!

237
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,886
You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...

238
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:49,227
Go on.

239
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,472
- You're wrong, Dr. Brewster...
- Must I hit you with a stick?

240
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:55,352
You're wrong.
I am very proud to be a woman.

241
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:56,979
And I'm proud of this hospital.

242
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:59,648
And before I see it destroyed
by your petty tyrannies...

243
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,150
Have the anger. Don't show it to me.

244
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,070
...I'll recommend you be
thrown out into the street.

245
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,071
- Don't lose it.
- Good day.

246
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,283
- Don't whine like you're second-rate.
- I said good day!

247
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:11,750
Not bad.

248
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:13,579
Did you feel how much I hated you?

249
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,248
- You really felt it?
- That's why I'm going.

250
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,253
How can I get it back tomorrow?
How can a total stranger enrage me?

251
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,881
I'll pick you up at 10:00
and enrage you.

252
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,682
Bruce Fortune to Telecine.
Bruce Fortune to Telecine.

253
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,060
- Bennett?
- Right here.

254
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,480
Stanz?

255
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,068
I'm supposed to look like this?

256
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,155
- That is what you look like.
- It's not funny.

257
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:45,656
Good.
Don't lose that.

258
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:48,868
No sequins, Alfred.
She's attending her husband's funeral.

259
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:52,372
Jacqui? As soon as Ron gets here, in.

260
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:53,872
Lester.

261
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:55,667
Lester. Sandy Lester?

262
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,294
Yes, here.

263
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,171
Stop it!

264
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:04,092
Bye-bye. Good morning, ladies.

265
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:06,971
Please bring your résumés
and follow me.

266
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:08,180
Wish me luck.

267
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,057
- Fuck you.
- Thank you.

268
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:12,059
- Go.
- God bless you.

269
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:17,065
Here you'll recognize your favorite
characters from Southwest General...

270
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:21,068
...including John Van Horn,
who has played Dr. Medford Brewster...

271
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,864
...since the first episode aired
20 years ago.

272
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:28,993
Now we'll head into Studio B,
where the episodes are actually taped.

273
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,375
Andrew Donovan,
report to Wardrobe, please.

274
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,875
I didn't get it.

275
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,878
- What?
- They wouldn't let me read.

276
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:42,465
- They wouldn't let you read?
- They said I wasn't right physically.

277
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,595
They want somebody tougher.
So I'm going home.

278
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,764
I'll walk you.

279
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:47,765
To San Diego?

280
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:51,060
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going home!

281
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:52,561
I hate it here!

282
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,980
God! I'm 34!
I paid $24 for these glasses.

283
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,775
All I do is buy things...
I want to be a waitress.

284
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:02,072
I wasn't gonna resort to this,
but you're gonna read.

285
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,330
Excuse me, is Terry Bishop here?

286
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:08,077
No, Mr. Bishop is rehearsing
The Iceman Cometh for Broadway.

287
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:09,287
He's what?

288
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:12,873
He's rehearsing The Iceman Cometh
for Broadway.

289
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:15,669
That was my part.
I was supposed to be up...

290
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,590
I got to see somebody.
Don't do anything rash.

291
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:21,467
Will he be back?

292
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,957
- Is George Fields in?
- Yes, he is.

293
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:48,789
Now, wait a minute.
You can't just go in there!

294
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:59,674
Michael, he's tied up right now.
I swear!

295
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:04,387
Hang on. Will you wait outside?
I'm talking to the Coast.

296
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,472
This is a coast.
New York is a coast too.

297
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:07,939
Oh, boy.

298
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:09,603
Sy, are you...

299
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:12,272
God... Look what you...
Margaret?

300
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,398
Get him back.
I cut myself off.

301
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,692
What is it, Michael?

302
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,405
Terry Bishop's doing Iceman.
You promised to send me up for that.

303
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,992
You told me I'd get a reading for that.
Aren't you my agent?

304
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,870
- Stuart Pressman wants a name.
- Terry Bishop is a name?

305
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:30,874
Michael Dorsey is a name,
when you want to send a steak back.

306
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,377
Wait, wait, wait!
You always do this to me.

307
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:37,089
It was a rotten thing to say.
Let me start again.

308
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,593
Terry Bishop is on a soap.
Millions watch him every day.

309
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,806
That qualifies him to ruin Iceman?
I can act circles around him.

310
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,479
- I played that part in Minneapolis.
- lf he wants a name, that's his affair.

311
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:52,773
People are in this business
to make money.

312
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:55,484
- I'm in it to make money too.
- Really?

313
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,988
The Harlem Theatre for the Blind?
The People's Workshop at Syracuse?

314
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,573
Wait a minute.
I did nine plays up at Syracuse.

315
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:05,495
I got great reviews from the critics.
Not that that's why I did it.

316
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,499
God forbid you should lose
your standing as a cult failure.

317
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:10,584
You think I'm a failure?

318
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,504
I will not get sucked
into this conversation.

319
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:14,880
I will not.

320
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:18,884
I sent you my roommate's play to read.
It had a great part in it for me.

321
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:22,388
Where do you come off sending me
a play for you to star in?

322
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:25,682
I'm not your mother.
I don't find plays for you to star in.

323
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:27,977
I field offers.
That's what I do.

324
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:29,897
Who told you that?
The agent fairy?

325
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,982
I could be terrific in that part.

326
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:35,276
- Nobody's going to do that play.
- Why?

327
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,781
It's a downer about a couple
that move back to Love Canal.

328
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:39,990
But that actually happened.

329
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:43,786
Nobody wants to watch people
living next to chemical waste!

330
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:45,580
They can see that in Jersey.

331
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:50,002
I don't want to argue about it.
I'll raise $8,000 and produce his play.

332
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,086
Send me up for anything.
I don't care.

333
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:55,674
I'll do dog commercials.
I'll do radio voice-overs.

334
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,010
- I can't put you up for that.
- Why not?

335
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:00,680
Because no one will hire you.

336
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,473
I bust my ass to get a part right!

337
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,976
And you bust everybody else's ass too!

338
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:09,104
Who wants to argue about
whether Tolstoy can...

339
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:12,108
...walk when he's dying
or walk when he's talking..?

340
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,112
That was two years ago,
and that guy's an idiot!

341
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,490
They can't all be idiots.
You argue with everybody!

342
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,994
You've got one of the worst
reputations in this town.

343
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,789
Nobody will hire you.

344
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,877
Are you saying that nobody
in New York will work with me?

345
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:33,213
Nobody in Hollywood will either.
I can't even get you a commercial.

346
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,803
You played a tomato, and they went over
schedule because you wouldn't sit.

347
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,560
Yes, it wasn't logical.

348
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,308
You were a tomato! A tomato
doesn't have logic. It can't move!

349
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,603
So if he can't move,
how's he going to sit down?

350
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,106
I was a stand-up tomato.
A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!

351
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,611
Nobody does vegetables like me!
I did vegetables off-Broadway!

352
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,614
I did the best tomato,
the best cucumber!

353
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:59,784
I did an endive salad that knocked
the critics on their ass!

354
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,913
I'm trying to stay calm here.

355
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:05,582
You are a wonderful actor.

356
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,501
Thank you.

357
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,879
But you're too much trouble.

358
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,798
Get some therapy.

359
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:16,094
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise
$8,000 to do Jeff's play.

360
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:19,514
Michael, you're not
gonna raise 25 cents.

361
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:22,600
No one will hire you.

362
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:24,310
Oh, yeah?

363
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,217
Dorothy Michaels?

364
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:57,512
- Yes.
- George Fields is your agent?

365
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,390
- Yes.
- Okay, ladies.

366
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:02,017
Please bring your pages
and follow me.

367
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:08,815
I hate this line,
"You have every right to happiness."

368
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,693
This is Dorothy Michaels.
Our director, Ron Carlysle.

369
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,115
That's our producer, Rita Marshall.
George Fields is Dorothy's agent.

370
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:17,785
That's impressive.

371
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:24,416
I'm afraid you're not right for
this role. Thanks for coming by.

372
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:26,919
Page 205, you want camera one or two?

373
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:30,424
- Camera two, and tell Art.
- Why am I not right?

374
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,217
I'm trying to make
a certain statement...

375
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:36,804
...and I'm looking for
a specific physical type.

376
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:42,102
Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress.
I can play it any way you want.

377
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:44,689
I'm sure you're a very good actress.

378
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:47,608
It's just that you're not
threatening enough.

379
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:48,900
Not threatening enough?

380
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:52,404
Take your hands off me or
I'll knee you in the balls!

381
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,201
- Is that enough of a threat?
- It's a start.

382
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:59,204
I think I know what you want.
You want a caricature of a woman.

383
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:02,998
To prove some point like
power makes a woman masculine...

384
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,918
...or masculine women are ugly.

385
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:08,590
Well, shame on any woman
that lets you do that.

386
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:10,716
And that means you, Miss Marshall.

387
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:14,303
Shame on you, you macho shithead.

388
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:16,512
Jesus!

389
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:21,896
What is idiotic about power
making a woman masculine?

390
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:25,900
Not that that was my point.

391
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:30,402
Miss Michaels, just a minute.

392
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,701
Was that for real
or were you auditioning?

393
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,619
Which answer will get me
a reading, Miss Marshall?

394
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,705
Well, good for you.

395
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,916
Come.

396
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,920
- Miss Michaels.
- Yes. Oh, thank you.

397
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:50,592
You really think she's worth testing?

398
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:55,222
She told me no director had ever
communicated a part to her so fast.

399
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:56,807
She said that?

400
00:22:58,391 --> 00:22:59,395
I like her...

401
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,894
...accent.

402
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,494
- I gotta get these back in order.
- They won't know the difference.

403
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,711
I'm a little nervous.

404
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,297
Just think of them
as something friendly.

405
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,298
Like a firing squad.

406
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:36,600
Miss Michaels, we're going to
do a camera test now.

407
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:41,229
Let me have a right profile, camera 1.
Camera 3, a left profile.

408
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:42,231
What side?

409
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:43,733
Left side.

410
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,609
Which way for your left?

411
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:48,613
- What?
- Is that my left or your left?

412
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:51,532
Wait. What are you talking about?
My left.

413
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:53,373
Your left.

414
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,036
Miss Michaels, nobody's talking to you.

415
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,331
I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted my profile.

416
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,627
- Not so close on camera 3.
- Camera 3, back off.

417
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,713
Make her look a little more attractive.
How far can you pull back?

418
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:07,800
- How do you feel about Cleveland?
- Knock it off.

419
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,635
That's good right there, Herbie.

420
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:13,515
Dorothy, honey, we're going
to try one. Okay?

421
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:16,934
Let me see exactly
what you showed us a while ago.

422
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:18,437
Cue her, Jo.

423
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,732
"I know the kind of woman
you are, Emily.

424
00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:26,819
You're getting older. You don't have
a man, so you want to act like one."

425
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:30,699
Shut your mouth right now. When you
talk to me, talk professionally.

426
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:35,037
You don't get personal.
That is inappropriate behavior.

427
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:37,625
I'm proud of being a woman,
Dr. Brewster.

428
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,334
I'm proud of this hospital,
and you should be too.

429
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:45,715
And I must tell you, before I let it
be destroyed by your petty tyrannies...

430
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:48,803
...by your callous inhumanities, sir...

431
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:52,723
...I'm going to recommend
you be turned out into the street.

432
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:56,727
Good day, Dr. Brewster.

433
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,814
I said good day, sir.

434
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:08,115
Thank you.
Hold it a minute.

435
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:09,825
Tough cookie.

436
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,534
I gave her that direction.

437
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,328
Something more, though.

438
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:18,417
I don't know. It's your decision,
but something about her bothers me.

439
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:20,210
I like it.

440
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,213
We'll send the contracts to George.

441
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:34,516
Excuse me. Could you help me?
I'm looking for the Russian Tea Room.

442
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:38,605
This is the Russian Tea Room.
You're in front of it.

443
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:40,732
Oh, well, my stars! So it is.

444
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:43,027
Well, this is very embarrassing.

445
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,530
Yeah, well, this is it.

446
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,406
Thanks very much.

447
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:57,917
Good afternoon, Mr. Fields.
Nice to see you. Please sit down.

448
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:03,633
- The waiter will be just a minute.
- George, how are you?

449
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:06,219
Hey, Ronnie. How are you?

450
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,645
- Hi.
- Wait a minute...

451
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,941
I'm new in town, and I'm lonely.
Would you buy me lunch?

452
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:22,026
You can't come...
Gregory, this woman...

453
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,320
Don't. It's okay.

454
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:27,116
George. George. George.
It's Michael Dorsey, okay?

455
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:31,912
Your favorite client. How are you?
Last job you got me was a tomato.

456
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:33,916
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Yeah.

457
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:36,543
- Swear to God.
- Michael?

458
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:39,337
Oh, God! I begged you to get therapy.

459
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:44,051
- You also said no one would hire me.
- And this'll make a difference?

460
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,927
I got a soap.

461
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:49,347
I'm the new woman administrator on
Southwest General.

462
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:52,643
Congratulate me! They thought
I almost looked too feminine.

463
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:57,024
- Something from the bar?
- A double vodka right away, please.

464
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,442
For the lady?

465
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,528
How about a Dubonnet with a twist?

466
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,528
- Thank you. Lovely blouse.
- Thank you.

467
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:06,448
- Welcome.
- You won't get away with this.

468
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:09,536
- I got away with it. Look around.
- I don't believe this.

469
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,039
I mean, I just don't
believe anybody else will.

470
00:27:13,124 --> 00:27:15,125
- You want to bet?
- Don't sit...

471
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:19,130
- You know Joel Spector.
- Hello, Joel. How are you?

472
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,551
I talked to Stuart yesterday.

473
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:26,638
He'll be one more week in London.
Then he definitely...

474
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:29,104
- I missed you!
- Then he definitely...

475
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,936
You're such a tickly-wickly. You
never were before. We go back years.

476
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:36,940
- We haven't been introduced.
- Joel Spector.

477
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:38,735
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Weintraub.

478
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:42,446
- Sorry. This is Michael...
- Dorothy Michaels. Nice to meet you.

479
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:45,450
May I say that you are
the best director...

480
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,534
- Producer.
- Sorry. Producer...

481
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:49,330
...on the Broadway scene today.

482
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:51,623
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Michaels.

483
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,836
- Hope to see you again.
- Let's have lunch.

484
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:57,545
- Fine.
- Call you.

485
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,923
He's handsome.
You should represent him.

486
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:02,344
- You are psychotic!
- No, I'm employed.

487
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:04,637
- I got the whole world...
- Don't!

488
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:08,224
- I won't make fun of you.
- Don't get close to me!

489
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:11,018
- Loan me $1000 till payday.
- For what?

490
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:14,939
For what? I gotta have something
to wear besides this.

491
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:34,753
I won't let you not buy it.
It's the best dress you've had on.

492
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,920
I think it makes me look dumpy.

493
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:40,926
Because you're wearing ankle straps.
With a few alterations...

494
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:44,054
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

495
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,223
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,351
What are you doing?
I was here first!

497
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,155
Thank you.

498
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,742
Those women were like animals.
I saw this beautiful handbag.

499
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,455
I was afraid to fight for it.
They're vicious. They kill their own.

500
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,545
The woman that finally bought
this handbag, I know did time.

501
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,754
Now I don't have a decent handbag.

502
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,340
You know what this lingerie cost?
And the makeup?

503
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,346
How does a woman keep herself
attractive and not starve?

504
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,430
Can I have more cottage cheese?

505
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:26,559
- You wore this today?
- I gotta set that before I go to bed.

506
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,144
Easy, easy, easy.
Please!

507
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,436
I'm dieting. Please.

508
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,439
I gotta get up at 4:30,
do a close shave.

509
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,943
I told the studio I do my own makeup
because I'm allergic.

510
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,738
I appreciate your doing this,
but it's for the money, isn't it?

511
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:43,033
It's not so you can wear
these little outfits?

512
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:47,956
I'm not even gonna answer that.
It's a great acting challenge.

513
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:50,460
You know what my problem is?

514
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,045
Cramps.

515
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,756
No, not cramps.

516
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:56,047
Sandy.

517
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:00,636
How can I tell her they cast a man
instead of her? She'll be suicidal.

518
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,846
Don't tell her.

519
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:04,140
Where will I say I got the money?

520
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:08,563
What am I going to do? Tell her
somebody died and left it to me?

521
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:10,856
- My God! When did she die?
- Last week.

522
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:12,148
Of what?

523
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:13,732
A disease.

524
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:16,236
Gee, what a coincidence.

525
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:20,741
I mean, your needing $8000 and
her leaving you exactly that much.

526
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,910
- Isn't it?
- It's, well...

527
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,454
- All right, kid.
- It's mine?

528
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,664
- Learn your lines.
- I'm excited!

529
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:28,749
This is the greatest part!

530
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:32,462
I want to take you to dinner.
It's time we celebrated something.

531
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:35,341
- To Return to the Love Canal.
- Hurry up.

532
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:39,052
- I'll jump in the shower.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!

533
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,942
Why, yes.

534
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:29,565
You know, we can stay here
if you want to, and...

535
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:32,443
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God! I'm...

536
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:38,740
Sandy, I want you.

537
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:40,598
You want me?

538
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:41,744
I want you.

539
00:31:42,872 --> 00:31:44,039
I want you.

540
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:51,338
- Will I ever see you again?
- We've known each other six years.

541
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:54,675
I know. But sex changes things.

542
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:58,262
I've had relationships where I
know a guy, then have sex with him...

543
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:01,473
...and then I bump into him and
he acts like I loaned him money.

544
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:04,143
That's not me.
I'll call you tomorrow.

545
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:08,648
I know there's pain in every
relationship. I just want my pain now.

546
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:11,152
Otherwise, I'll wait by the phone...

547
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:13,863
...and then I'll have pain
and wait by the phone.

548
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,071
It's a waste of time.

549
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:17,574
Let's make it definite.
Dinner tomorrow.

550
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:21,267
Mom?

551
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:27,148
What do you think?
Hurry. I'm late.

552
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:28,944
Turn around.

553
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:32,447
Smile.

554
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:36,367
- Say something.
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.

555
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:38,474
You look very nice. Nice.

556
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,870
But the hair's not right.

557
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,750
You got a Howard Johnson's thing going.

558
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:46,170
Do something. I can't be late
my first day. Come on.

559
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:50,258
- Easy, easy!
- It's not your head.

560
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:52,175
- Okay?
- Let's see.

561
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:54,344
Well, it works.

562
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:57,057
But what?

563
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,976
Don't play hard to get.

564
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,979
Taxi! Taxi!

565
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:03,979
Taxi!

566
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:16,785
- Dorothy Michaels. Southwest General.
- Oh, yeah.

567
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:18,954
TV 2.
Straight ahead, first right.

568
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,164
Is that clock right?

569
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:21,957
- Yes.
- I couldn't get a cab.

570
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,378
Hi, Bobby. This is Miss Michaels.

571
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:30,049
You'll be in Room 4. We'll need you
on set in about 15 minutes.

572
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,515
- I'm sorry.
- That's ok...

573
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:34,556
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's quite all right.

574
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:38,058
- I'm April Paige.
- My, what a nice-looking table.

575
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,478
- Really?
- Yes, it's very smooth.

576
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:43,648
And that's a very good idea.
A socket for a plug.

577
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,651
- Yeah, well, we got everything.
- Yes, I see.

578
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:50,656
Just push all that out of the way.
Make yourself at home.

579
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:54,869
Yes?

580
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,372
One more thing, Miss Michaels.
I forgot to give you these.

581
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,375
Oh, are these for today?

582
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:03,585
They always throw stuff
at you in the last minute.

583
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:05,462
- My goodness!
- What's wrong?

584
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:08,883
- I have to kiss Dr. Brewster!
- He kisses all the women.

585
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:11,761
We call him "The Tongue."

586
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:17,058
Okay, quickly. Now, the tubes
have pulled out of Rick's nose.

587
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,686
Julie, there's an alert
at your station.

588
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,857
Rick, get on the floor.
That's why the tubes pulled out.

589
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:26,275
When Julie starts stuffing
the tubes back up your nose...

590
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:29,362
...you grab her hard.
- In his condition?

591
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,284
Yes. He's been crazy
since he fell through the ice.

592
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:34,786
You're delirious.
You think she's Anthea.

593
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:37,289
- Mr. Carlysle, I...
- Jesus Christ!

594
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:40,291
Could I have
a little more hammering here?!

595
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:46,965
Now, when you grab her,
maybe you even say, "Anthea! Anthea!"

596
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:49,594
Good. Is my violin somewhere
in the room?

597
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:52,971
Your violin sunk.
It's at the bottom of the lake.

598
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,059
The violin fell through the ice.

599
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:58,562
He was playing during the thaw.

600
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:01,272
You're Dorothy Michaels, aren't you?

601
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,567
I'm John Van Horn.

602
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:05,777
We're up next.

603
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,495
When he grabs you,
you've got to be torn, to struggle.

604
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:18,291
You know you've got to get those
tubes stuck back up his nose.

605
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,086
But you also realize
you're in the arms of a man...

606
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:25,466
...whose music was everything to Anthea.
It was her whole life.

607
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:28,970
This is a man who stood by you
after Ted's breakdown.

608
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:31,179
Get me a bagel and cream cheese.

609
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,556
- Julie, you want anything?
- No. She's fine, thanks.

610
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:39,271
So it's a struggle, but you're
struggling with yourself as well.

611
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,067
- And I lose, right?
- Get down here a minute.

612
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:45,862
Now, then, Rick, it says when she
comes down to her knees...

613
00:36:46,696 --> 00:36:48,572
...it inflames your desire.

614
00:36:48,697 --> 00:36:50,367
God knows, it inflames mine.

615
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:52,285
Okay, Big John.

616
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:54,579
Dorothy, come in here.

617
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:58,459
This is Dorothy Michaels,
the new hospital administrator.

618
00:36:58,667 --> 00:36:59,794
Hello, Dorothy.

619
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:03,590
Hi! We met the other day.
Julie Nichols, hospital slut.

620
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,591
No! Now, Mr. Carlysle...

621
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:08,970
I'm sorry, but we have so little time,
we can't even rehearse.

622
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:13,391
I'm gonna show you your marks,
and then we'll go straight to tape.

623
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:17,271
Big John, you'll enter from here,
you see them struggling...

624
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:21,566
...you cross to here and cry loudly,
"Nurse Charles! Are you insane?"

625
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:25,570
Yes, I see. Will it be
on the teleprompter? "Loudly?"

626
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:27,490
And who do I say that to?

627
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,576
Nurse Charles.

628
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:32,370
I thought when Dr. Brewster...

629
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:35,499
You will enter from here,
cross to this mark.

630
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,501
I know my mark.
But I thought...

631
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:41,588
The corridor scene will be played
right here. Right?

632
00:37:41,797 --> 00:37:44,591
See, I just wanted to ask
concerning the doctor...

633
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:47,094
Places, please.
Stand by, tape is rolling.

634
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:52,100
Five, four, three...

635
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:55,269
Anthea!

636
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,236
Oh, Anthea!

637
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:58,898
Freeze up.
One twenty-five.

638
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,989
Nurse Charles! Are you insane?

639
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,866
I'm Emily Kimberly,
the new hospital administrator.

640
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:12,287
Nurse Charles, what on earth
is going on here, dear?

641
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:15,083
Help me get her to her feet,
Miss Kimberly.

642
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,167
John's going.

643
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:23,090
Nurse Charles, tend to your patient
and faint on your own time!

644
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,677
- Yes, Miss...
- Kimberly.

645
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,178
Dr. Brewster...

646
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,389
...you and I must talk.

647
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:32,185
- Rita, you want to keep rolling?
- It's okay. The girl saved it.

648
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,270
- You haven't changed, Emily.
- But I have, Medford.

649
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,983
You know, Emily, there's no reason
for us to be in opposite camps.

650
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,779
We can rule Southwest General together.

651
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,908
I admire people with power.

652
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,995
Women with power, especially.

653
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,790
God, she hit him on the head.
Rita, she hit him.

654
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,168
- and not consider it a threat?

655
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm afraid that you have
underestimated me.

656
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,092
If you want to win me over,
you'll deal with my mind...

657
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:03,800
...and not my lips.

658
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:05,679
- Cut it.
- And stop tape.

659
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,598
- I was supposed to kiss her.
- It was just an instinct.

660
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:11,685
Remember what you said about
being more threatening?

661
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:14,479
It was a good instinct.
It would've been mine.

662
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:17,190
Wait. I'll handle the instincts here.

663
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,610
It happened to be a good
instinct, toots.

664
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,905
But next time you want to change
something, discuss it with me first.

665
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:27,578
Yes. I was wrong not to.

666
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:28,912
Good girl.

667
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:30,643
Big John, wonderful!

668
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,872
All right, people.

669
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:34,710
Item seven. In the corridor.

670
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:37,213
Thanks for catching me.

671
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,799
You saved my ass. Literally.

672
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:42,677
Dorothy...

673
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:46,806
...I just want to say I loved what you
did in our scene. Welcome aboard!

674
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,476
Well, you know, you were good too...

675
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:02,196
Can I have your autograph?
I've always watched the show.

676
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:03,574
You're so great.

677
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,701
Wonderful! Oh, thank you!

678
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:08,079
Thank you. That was an
exhilarating first day.

679
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:10,998
- Tell me about it next week.
- Good night.

680
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:12,583
Julie, come on, baby.

681
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:16,378
Can we drop you?
Maybe you'd like to join us for a drink.

682
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,882
- No, thanks. I feel like walking.
- Okay, bye.

683
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,398
She's a very attractive girl.

684
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,276
And no dummy.
But for the life of me...

685
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:40,780
...I cannot understand why she
hangs around with that director.

686
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,907
He treats her like she's just...

687
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,284
...nothing!

688
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,577
I think you're right.

689
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,206
I'm rewriting the necktie scene
without the necktie.

690
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:51,291
He's condescending.
He calls me "sweetheart."

691
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,209
He doesn't even know my name.

692
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,004
He calls her "baby."

693
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:59,591
He pushed me around. If not for
the dress, I'd have kicked his ass.

694
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:01,887
How'd you communicate with him?

695
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:04,889
He told me what he wanted.
I didn't say anything.

696
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:09,518
I did it my way. He bawled me out.
I apologized. That was that.

697
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:14,190
I think Dorothy's smarter than I am.

698
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:17,612
I just wish I looked prettier.
I look in the mirror and...

699
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:19,781
Maybe I can just get a softer...

700
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:23,200
...hair or something,
because she deserves it.

701
00:41:24,995 --> 00:41:26,996
- Don't answer that!
- Why not?

702
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:31,084
- It could be for Dorothy. Please.
- Why'd you give them this number?

703
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:34,504
The show has to contact me
in case they change the schedule.

704
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:36,299
I'll find out.

705
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:39,719
They can't think Dorothy lives
with a man! It's wrong for her.

706
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,096
It could be for me.
Answer as Dorothy.

707
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,515
I can't!
What if it's Sandy?

708
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:47,309
If it's Diane, how do I
explain there's a woman here?

709
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:49,187
I'll get a service tomorrow.

710
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:55,694
When you were playing Cyrano and you
stuck a saber in my armpit...

711
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:57,321
...I didn't say anything.

712
00:41:57,487 --> 00:42:00,407
When you were hopping around,
ranting about your hump...

713
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,285
...saying this was a bell tower,
I didn't say anything.

714
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:06,706
But I don't see why I should
pretend I'm not home...

715
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:09,292
...just because you're not
that kind of girl.

716
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:10,793
That's weird.

717
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:14,296
- Where are you going?
- To Diane's.

718
00:42:14,504 --> 00:42:18,302
That way if anybody wants to reach me,
they can talk to me.

719
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:23,891
What do you think I'm doing this for?
For you, for the play, for Sandy...

720
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:28,312
I told you to give me
the pain yesterday.

721
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:31,107
Sandy, I'm sorry.
I can't talk long.

722
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:33,609
I just don't have the energy.

723
00:42:34,027 --> 00:42:36,322
I didn't forget.
I just may have the flu.

724
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:38,198
Do you have a fever?

725
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,408
How much? Go right to bed
and take two aspirin...

726
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:43,496
...bundle up, sweat, and drink liquids.

727
00:42:43,997 --> 00:42:47,625
Above all, take 1000 units of
vitamin C every hour with milk only.

728
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,113
Did you give Melanie
an overdose on purpose?

729
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:18,116
I don't know.
I don't write the shit, you know.

730
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:22,327
Don't be so hard on Dr. Brewster.
He's insecure.

731
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,915
I have to be tough.
He just wants my body.

732
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:27,417
Dorothy, you're so bad.

733
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:32,506
- You look just the way you look.
- Thank you. You're very attractive too.

734
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,508
I want you to meet my dad, Les.

735
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:37,427
- It's nice to meet you.
- I feel I know you already.

736
00:43:38,096 --> 00:43:40,305
I just love your daughter to pieces.

737
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:56,033
I can't write any clearer
than I can write. It's in English.

738
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:58,327
- What about those?
- For Sandy?

739
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:01,995
For me, for Dorothy. Not exactly,
but that kind of idea.

740
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,497
- A little overstated.
- Really? Wait a minute!

741
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,209
Jesus!

742
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,795
- That's her.
- Mr. Earl!

743
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:18,430
You got it.
Thursday, what time?

744
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:22,018
8:30.

745
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,811
I will not forget.
Okay, bye-bye.

746
00:44:36,116 --> 00:44:39,036
"Things are better since you
came to Southwest General."

747
00:44:39,704 --> 00:44:41,496
- "We're so grateful to you."
- For?

748
00:44:41,622 --> 00:44:46,502
- "For your help and advice."
- "I think of you all as my daughters."

749
00:44:47,212 --> 00:44:50,424
"What kind of mother wouldn't
give her girls tits?"

750
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:52,801
"Tips."
It's "tips."

751
00:44:53,635 --> 00:44:54,635
Tips.

752
00:44:54,718 --> 00:44:57,722
You'll find you picked
the wrong man to challenge.

753
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:01,226
It was you who pro...
Look at me when I talk to you.

754
00:45:01,726 --> 00:45:03,569
I don't trust a man
who won't meet my eye.

755
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:06,315
I don't trust it in a bank teller
or a salesman.

756
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:10,027
And I certainly don't trust it
in a chief surgeon.

757
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:12,320
You provoked this confrontation.

758
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,907
You're an incredibly
insensitive woman.

759
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,703
Stop thinking of me as a woman
and start thinking of me as a person.

760
00:45:19,203 --> 00:45:21,915
That's what Southwest General
is made of, people.

761
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:26,126
And have Nurse Charles
see me immediately.

762
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,341
- Push in for a close-up.
- Not too close!

763
00:45:30,715 --> 00:45:32,509
Okay, hold it there.

764
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:35,011
- And cut it!
- Stop tape.

765
00:45:36,722 --> 00:45:39,808
Dorothy, it was wonderful
the way you held my face.

766
00:45:40,226 --> 00:45:42,019
You controlled me completely.

767
00:45:42,227 --> 00:45:44,606
Thank you, but you had
some great moments.

768
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:46,607
Hold it. Good news, children.

769
00:45:46,732 --> 00:45:50,321
Our brilliant engineers have
again erased a reel of the show.

770
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:54,324
So we have to retape
14, 15 and 16.

771
00:45:56,242 --> 00:45:58,412
It's either that
or do it live, tomorrow.

772
00:45:58,704 --> 00:46:00,415
I think we should tape it.

773
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:04,544
That's a wrap. See you bright
and early, 6:30 tomorrow.

774
00:46:19,225 --> 00:46:21,813
- Good night, Dorothy.
- Good night, Ben.

775
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:27,235
That's some day, huh?

776
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,614
What? Oh, you mean about
doing it over again.

777
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,616
Tell me, does that happen often?

778
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:36,827
Every once in a while.
We actually had to do it live once.

779
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,121
Live!

780
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:42,043
You should have seen Van Horn's face.
He was so panicked...

781
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:44,544
...we had to shoot him from the back.

782
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,005
- Want some wine?
- No, thanks. I better go home.

783
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:52,137
I have to wash my hair.
Thanks anyway.

784
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:53,930
- Dorothy?
- Yes?

785
00:46:54,347 --> 00:46:57,809
Listen, I know this is exactly
what you want to hear now...

786
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:00,936
...but we've got 26 pages,
and I was wondering...

787
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:05,109
...if you could come over and
run some lines with me tonight.

788
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:07,944
I could make you something to eat.

789
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,532
Night, Fay.

790
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,240
I'm a born defroster.

791
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:13,410
You don't have a thing to wear?

792
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:16,621
- She's seen me in all these.
- Not in the white thing.

793
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,126
What, this? You cannot wear white
to a casual dinner. It's too dressy.

794
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:24,545
- You couldn't wear pants?
- No. Pants? I can't.

795
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,549
- What about this?
- No shoes for it.

796
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,718
The lines make me look hippy...

797
00:47:29,843 --> 00:47:31,719
...and it cuts me across the bust.

798
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:35,350
We're getting into a weird area.

799
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:37,436
This is smart.
What about this?

800
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:40,021
Looks like you should
ring a school bell.

801
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,733
This may seem silly to you,
but this is our first date.

802
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:45,527
I want to look pretty for her.

803
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,824
Hi.
What a pretty outfit.

804
00:47:50,324 --> 00:47:51,741
- Glad you like it.
- Come on in.

805
00:47:51,826 --> 00:47:54,036
- Brought you something.
- You didn't have to.

806
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,038
It wasn't nothing.

807
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,125
Come in.
I'll put them in water.

808
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,253
What a big apartment.

809
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:04,423
- What a lovely, lovely room.
- Is it?

810
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,551
- Yes, it's yummy.
- I had a decorator do it.

811
00:48:08,426 --> 00:48:10,346
Before, no money.
Now, no time.

812
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,141
- Amy is asleep. Finally.
- Scared the daylights out of me.

813
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:19,648
Miss Nichols, that child is never
going to learn anything if you keep...

814
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,649
Thank you, Mrs. Crawley.

815
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,318
- Dorothy, Mrs. Crawley.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

816
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,446
Nice meeting you.

817
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,240
- Scares the shit out of me.
- Scared me to death.

818
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,118
Drop your coat here.

819
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,747
- Who is it?
- Amy's nanny.

820
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,122
And she hates me.

821
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:37,332
Who's Amy?

822
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,543
My daughter.

823
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,754
She was 14 months old last week.

824
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:43,631
I didn't know you had a baby.

825
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,842
You got any kids, Dorothy?

826
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:50,847
- Were you ever married?
- I haven't been that fortunate.

827
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:55,144
I was engaged once, though,
to a brilliant young actor...

828
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:58,940
...whose career was cut short by
the theatrical establishment.

829
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,338
- They killed him?
- So to speak.

830
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:05,237
Sutton gave up acting, and me as well.

831
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:09,825
He's working now as a waiter
in a disreputable restaurant.

832
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:11,828
I don't want to talk about it.

833
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:13,246
Maybe you'd like some wine?

834
00:49:13,955 --> 00:49:17,249
No, I think I'd better keep sharp
when we work, you know?

835
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:20,628
You mind if I ask you a question?

836
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:24,342
Do you worry about using so much
heavy makeup on your skin?

837
00:49:24,926 --> 00:49:26,344
I don't worry.

838
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:27,720
I have a little...

839
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:31,139
...moustache problem I'm sensitive to.

840
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:34,351
Probably just too many
male hormones or something.

841
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:38,858
Some men find that attractive.

842
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:42,860
I know, I know. I just don't like
the men that find it attractive.

843
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:48,325
So you're divorced?

844
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:50,744
I've never been married.

845
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,124
Perhaps I'll have
one little drink.

846
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,135
Tell me about Ron.

847
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:08,555
- How much time have you got?
- Go on.

848
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:10,932
Well, Ron...

849
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:14,644
Ron is, hands down, the best
director of daytime drama.

850
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:17,357
Did they tell you
not to call it a soap yet?

851
00:50:18,024 --> 00:50:21,527
If anybody calls it a soap opera,
Rita fines them a quarter.

852
00:50:21,944 --> 00:50:23,363
It's how she got her car.

853
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,656
You're not telling me
about you and Ron.

854
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:30,037
That's nighttime drama.
He's interesting there too.

855
00:50:30,538 --> 00:50:32,247
Oh, you mean he's...

856
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:36,335
You mean you have a good relationship.

857
00:50:37,045 --> 00:50:40,965
What's a good relationship, Dotty?
Can I call you Dotty?

858
00:50:41,465 --> 00:50:44,927
- Oh, please do.
- Ron's smart and he's funny.

859
00:50:45,553 --> 00:50:46,930
We got things in common.

860
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:49,933
You know a guy who wants a woman
who eats at four...

861
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:52,143
...is unconscious by nine
and works at dawn?

862
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,230
But how does he treat you?

863
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:57,651
Oh, that!

864
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:01,362
- You think I do this without a plan?
- What do you mean?

865
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:06,241
There are a lot of men out there.
I'm selective. I look around carefully.

866
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,329
When I find the one who can
give me the worst time...

867
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:11,666
...that's when I make my move.

868
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:23,552
My lines sound like subtitles
for a Czech movie.

869
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:27,265
Try answering as if the question
took you by surprise.

870
00:51:27,557 --> 00:51:28,434
What do you mean?

871
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:30,853
I'll ask a question.
You just answer it.

872
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:33,562
Why do you drink so much?

873
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:39,443
When you grow up as I did, an orphan
raised by a sister 16 years older...

874
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,363
...you have few illusions.

875
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,865
- There you go.
- It made a difference?

876
00:51:44,032 --> 00:51:44,868
You got it.

877
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:46,952
Thanks, Dorothy.

878
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:50,955
Why do you drink so much?

879
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,167
Because it's not fattening...

880
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:57,047
...and it's not good for me.
How many things can you say that about?

881
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:00,049
You telling me to mind
my own business.

882
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:02,552
I just don't think you
should worry about it.

883
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,767
- It's nice of you, but...
- But I should mind my own business.

884
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,772
It's all so complicated, isn't it?

885
00:52:13,646 --> 00:52:15,441
- What?
- All of it.

886
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,945
Don't you find being a woman
in the '80s complicated?

887
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:20,863
Extremely.

888
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:24,368
- You know what I wish, just once?
- What?

889
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,956
That a guy could be honest enough
to walk up to me and say...

890
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:31,166
..."Hey, I'm confused about this too.

891
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:35,045
I could lay a big line on you,
we could do lots of role-playing...

892
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:39,258
...but the simple truth is,
I find you very interesting...

893
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:43,138
...and I'd really like to make love
with you." Simple as that.

894
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:46,057
- Wouldn't that be a relief?
- Heaven.

895
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:47,767
Sheer heaven.

896
00:52:49,145 --> 00:52:53,273
Ron was supposed to come over
last night. I had dinner all ready.

897
00:52:53,649 --> 00:52:55,067
He never showed up.

898
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:56,945
Oh, my Lord!
What time is it?

899
00:52:57,652 --> 00:52:58,736
It's 10:30.

900
00:52:59,155 --> 00:53:00,156
I gotta go.

901
00:53:00,656 --> 00:53:04,576
Listen, forgive me for rushing off.
It was a wonderful dinner.

902
00:53:22,138 --> 00:53:23,103
The dinner is burned.

903
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:26,058
I'm sorry I'm late.
But I was taking a shower...

904
00:53:26,642 --> 00:53:28,269
...and the water turned off...

905
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:30,940
...and I got soap in my eyes.

906
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:34,942
I had to go to five stores to get
chocolate-chocolate chip.

907
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,445
Michael, I saw her.

908
00:53:37,153 --> 00:53:38,446
What? You saw who?

909
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:41,450
When you were late,
I went by your place.

910
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:45,370
I waited outside and I saw that
fat woman go into your apartment.

911
00:53:45,747 --> 00:53:47,247
Fat woman?

912
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,875
The one in the raincoat.

913
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:53,880
Oh, that woman!
That's a friend of Jeff's.

914
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:56,967
She came over to help him
with the play.

915
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,554
They've known each other for years.

916
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:02,144
You think she's fat?

917
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,267
Well, it was dark but, yes,
I thought she was fat.

918
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:08,145
When did Jeff start
collaborating on his play?

919
00:54:08,772 --> 00:54:10,648
She's an excellent typist.

920
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:14,068
Look, I'm not having
an affair with that woman.

921
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:16,154
It's impossible.

922
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,657
I don't want to make trouble.

923
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:22,368
I shouldn't have people over.
They never show up.

924
00:54:22,744 --> 00:54:25,665
I'm sorry. I feel guilty.
You feel guilty. I'm sorry.

925
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:30,084
Don't do that. Don't apologize
because I'm three hours late.

926
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:32,464
You should be furious.

927
00:54:32,754 --> 00:54:34,172
You've been great to me.

928
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:38,762
You helped me with the audition
for that soap. It's that soap!

929
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:41,556
That soap!

930
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:45,352
Did you see that cow they hired?

931
00:54:45,768 --> 00:54:46,644
Cow?

932
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:49,273
They must've gone a different way.

933
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:50,982
She is awful.

934
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:56,280
Well, I heard she was pretty good.

935
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:57,280
Baloney!

936
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:00,763
She's supposed to be tough, right?

937
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,662
She's not tough.
She's a wimp!

938
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:06,250
Maybe it's the lines.
She doesn't make them up.

939
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,459
Well, I think she should.

940
00:55:08,877 --> 00:55:10,341
They couldn't be any worse.

941
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:12,464
I can't move out, Miss Kimberly.

942
00:55:12,757 --> 00:55:14,550
I have no place to go.

943
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:17,470
I don't know what to do.

944
00:55:20,848 --> 00:55:24,310
Don't tell me your husband beats you,
but you can't move out.

945
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:27,230
- Why should you move?
- What is she saying?

946
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:28,481
Three's up. Ready one.

947
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:31,318
You know what I'd do
if somebody did this to me?

948
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:35,781
I'd pick up the biggest thing
around and I'd just...

949
00:55:36,823 --> 00:55:38,658
...bash their brains
right through...

950
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:42,454
...the top of their skull before
I'd let them beat me up again.

951
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:47,002
Well, I can't afford therapy,
Miss Kimberly.

952
00:55:47,253 --> 00:55:49,378
Who said anything about therapy?

953
00:55:49,755 --> 00:55:51,088
- Cut it, Ron.
- Cut it!

954
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:54,425
Wait a minute. Her line is
"Your husband..."

955
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:55,759
Wait a second.

956
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:57,763
May I say in my own defense...

957
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:00,934
...to tell a woman
with two children, no money...

958
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:04,102
...and a husband who beats
her up like this...

959
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,774
...to move into a welfare center
to get therapy is a lot of...

960
00:56:08,357 --> 00:56:10,860
...horseshit!
I wouldn't do it, would you?

961
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:13,364
- I can't act with this.
- Oh, shut up.

962
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:14,657
Ron?

963
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:34,718
I'm partially to blame, Miss Kimberly.

964
00:56:35,386 --> 00:56:38,098
I know I'm pretty, and I use it.

965
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:41,894
I guess I shouldn't have gone
to Dr. Brewster's office so late.

966
00:56:42,393 --> 00:56:43,563
No, that's not true.

967
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:47,817
Dr. Brewster has tried to seduce
several nurses on this ward...

968
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:51,737
...claiming to be in the throes
of an uncontrollable impulse.

969
00:56:51,905 --> 00:56:53,405
Do you know what?

970
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:59,078
I'm going to give every nurse
on this floor an electric cattle prod...

971
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,665
...and instruct them to just zap
him in his "badubies."

972
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:04,381
Cattle prod?

973
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:07,420
Ruby. Hi, do you want to
open up the yellow pages...

974
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:10,466
...under the section
of Farm Equipment...

975
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:24,836
I am Dorothy. Nobody's writing her.
It's coming out of me.

976
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,506
You're Michael acting Dorothy.

977
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:29,843
It's the same thing.
I'm experiencing these feelings.

978
00:58:30,595 --> 00:58:35,431
Why can't you get me a special?
I feel I have something to say to women.

979
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:39,645
- You have nothing to say to women.
- I have plenty to say to women.

980
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,940
I've been an unemployed
actor for 20 years!

981
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:46,109
I know what it's like to wait
for the phone to ring!

982
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:50,240
Then when I finally get a job,
I have no control! I got zip!

983
00:58:50,615 --> 00:58:52,824
If I could impart that experience
to other women...

984
00:58:53,117 --> 00:58:56,037
There are no other women
like you. You're a man!

985
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,416
Yes, I realize that, of course.
But I'm also an actress.

986
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:03,630
- We shouldn't argue about this.
- I'm a potentially great actress.

987
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:08,633
I could do Medea, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth.
Just like in Shakespeare's day.

988
00:59:09,217 --> 00:59:10,887
Get the writers at the agency...

989
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:13,013
I could do a great Eleanor Roosevelt.

990
00:59:13,138 --> 00:59:14,932
We can do the
Eleanor Roosevelt story!

991
00:59:15,141 --> 00:59:17,143
The Eleanor Roosevelt story?

992
00:59:17,644 --> 00:59:19,437
What's the matter with that?

993
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:22,232
Phil Weintraub's party is Saturday.
Let's just go.

994
00:59:22,648 --> 00:59:25,236
Have a good time.
Don't take yourself so seriously.

995
00:59:25,568 --> 00:59:28,239
- He never invited me to a party.
- I'm inviting you.

996
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:31,742
He did a fabulous job on your eyes.

997
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:34,244
I can't blink for a week. Really.

998
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,831
- I don't like it here.
- Stand up straight.

999
00:59:45,132 --> 00:59:47,551
- What do you want?
- A double champagne.

1000
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:52,680
What is this?
Just serve yourself?

1001
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:55,142
Hi. What would you like?

1002
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,018
Give me two...

1003
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,023
- Two what?
- Of anything.

1004
01:00:05,737 --> 01:00:07,823
- I'm sorry...
- A couple of champagnes.

1005
01:00:13,745 --> 01:00:17,249
- Can I get you something?
- Vodka on the rocks with a twist.

1006
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:19,335
You don't remember me?

1007
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:22,630
When I came in, I thought
you looked familiar.

1008
01:00:23,213 --> 01:00:25,800
- What's your name again?
- Suzanne.

1009
01:00:26,216 --> 01:00:27,634
Call Pamela Green, my agent.

1010
01:00:27,718 --> 01:00:30,429
Paramount's interested.
I'll know after the first.

1011
01:00:31,223 --> 01:00:32,515
I'll read it after the first.

1012
01:00:32,725 --> 01:00:35,434
Actually, I'm not that crazy
about the script.

1013
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:39,523
I'm having a rewrite done.
Maybe we could have dinner.

1014
01:00:40,231 --> 01:00:42,151
Call Pamela.
She handles me for dinner.

1015
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:43,819
Do you have a light?

1016
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:46,155
- How've you been?
- Great.

1017
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:48,116
- Good.
- You look wonderful.

1018
01:00:50,243 --> 01:00:52,120
Silly me, I already had dinner.

1019
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:54,955
I didn't know there'd be so much food.

1020
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:56,249
It's for my dog.

1021
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:57,750
He likes fruit.

1022
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:01,547
Mike Dorsey.

1023
01:01:02,756 --> 01:01:03,925
Great view, huh?

1024
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:07,552
Only Phil could afford all those lights.

1025
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,723
You know...

1026
01:01:10,724 --> 01:01:13,644
...I could lay a big line on you...

1027
01:01:13,727 --> 01:01:17,146
...and we could do a lot of
role-playing, but the simple truth...

1028
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:20,650
...is that I find you
very interesting.

1029
01:01:20,734 --> 01:01:22,527
And I'd like to make love to you.

1030
01:01:23,238 --> 01:01:25,030
You know?
It's as sim...

1031
01:01:28,242 --> 01:01:29,827
As simple as that.

1032
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:43,550
I understand who you really are.

1033
01:01:43,842 --> 01:01:47,346
And I'll no longer submit to your
petty insults and humiliations.

1034
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:50,141
It's not necessary now that
Emily Kimberly's here.

1035
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,226
Now that someone who sees
the truth is your equal.

1036
01:01:53,351 --> 01:01:56,939
Listen, doctor, I've filed charges
against you with the AMA.

1037
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,857
You'll be notified tomorrow.

1038
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,527
- And cut it.
- Cut.

1039
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:02,945
It's a good one.

1040
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,948
Perfect.

1041
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,536
- That was great.
- Thanks, John.

1042
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:11,162
- Lovely job. First-rate.
- You were wonderful.

1043
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:12,622
Thanks to my coach.

1044
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:14,542
No, you did it yourself.

1045
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,543
- Was it okay?
- I loved the middle...

1046
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:18,964
So much for the
mutual-admiration society.

1047
01:02:19,338 --> 01:02:22,342
Let's move on to item 17.
Jo, clear this set.

1048
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:25,927
I'll need Alan, Tom and John.

1049
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:27,765
Tootsie, take 10.

1050
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:29,140
Ron?

1051
01:02:29,348 --> 01:02:30,349
My name is Dorothy.

1052
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,644
It's not Tootsie or Toots
or Sweetie or Honey or Doll.

1053
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:36,565
- Oh, Christ.
- No, just Dorothy.

1054
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:39,860
Alan's always Alan, Tom's always Tom
and John's always John.

1055
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,448
I have a name too. It's Dorothy,
capital D-O-R-O-T-H-Y.

1056
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:45,742
Dorothy.

1057
01:02:47,826 --> 01:02:49,246
Excuse me, doctor.

1058
01:03:03,844 --> 01:03:04,930
Did somebody die?

1059
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:08,057
- Violinist.
- I didn't know he was that sick.

1060
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:10,559
He wasn't.
He asked for a raise.

1061
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:16,358
I'm sorry about what
happened out there.

1062
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:20,361
- I was upset.
- What're you doing for the holidays?

1063
01:03:20,861 --> 01:03:22,031
Why?

1064
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:27,160
Well, the baby and I are gonna
go up to my dad's farm upstate.

1065
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:31,249
It's not exactly the fast lane,
but it's kind of fun.

1066
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,543
Maybe you'd like to come along?

1067
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:39,632
You know, since my dad met you,
he's your biggest fan.

1068
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:42,344
Is Ron coming too?

1069
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:45,764
Would that make a difference?

1070
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:48,266
Actually...

1071
01:03:48,432 --> 01:03:51,060
...I think he has to stay
in town and work.

1072
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:55,733
If it matters...

1073
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,237
...I've always hated women who treat
other women as stand-ins for men.

1074
01:04:00,948 --> 01:04:02,531
It's not that, really.

1075
01:04:03,951 --> 01:04:05,243
I'd just like you to come.

1076
01:04:05,952 --> 01:04:09,957
I just don't want to get up too soon
or I'll have another relapse.

1077
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:14,252
Isn't there some way we could rehearse
in the same room together?

1078
01:04:14,462 --> 01:04:17,674
We will. Right after the weekend.
I'll call you Monday.

1079
01:04:17,966 --> 01:04:19,132
Thanks. Bye-bye.

1080
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:22,762
You know where my pink nightgown is?
With the flow...

1081
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,055
- Listen to me.
- What?

1082
01:04:24,473 --> 01:04:25,640
Stop packing.

1083
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:26,767
Don't do this.

1084
01:04:26,933 --> 01:04:28,768
- Why?
- You should not do this.

1085
01:04:29,435 --> 01:04:32,772
In two weeks, if I ever see Julie again,
it'll be as Michael...

1086
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:35,567
...and she'll probably
throw a drink in my face.

1087
01:04:35,943 --> 01:04:38,946
- How can you keep lying to Sandy?
- It's for her own good.

1088
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:43,075
I never told Sandy I wouldn't
see other women. Come on.

1089
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,662
If I told her, it would hurt her
and I don't want to do that.

1090
01:04:47,037 --> 01:04:49,874
Especially since Julie and I
are just girlfriends.

1091
01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:52,252
I'm just afraid you'll
burn in hell for this.

1092
01:04:52,961 --> 01:04:55,754
I don't believe in hell.
I believe in unemployment.

1093
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,167
- Wait! Let me get those.
- Oh, well, thank you.

1094
01:05:31,545 --> 01:05:33,963
- Strong little thing, aren't you?
- Well, no.

1095
01:05:36,548 --> 01:05:39,178
Come on, Dorothy.
I'll show you the house.

1096
01:05:39,552 --> 01:05:43,140
- Careful coming up here.
- It really is old, isn't it?

1097
01:05:44,976 --> 01:05:46,061
Here we are.

1098
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:50,940
I'll set up the crib in a second.

1099
01:05:51,065 --> 01:05:52,566
Unpack your bags and we'll...

1100
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:54,776
Wait. Are we sharing?

1101
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,572
The upstairs is shut off.
And I know you girls.

1102
01:05:58,073 --> 01:06:02,161
No matter what, you'll sneak back
together and spend the night giggling.

1103
01:06:03,078 --> 01:06:05,372
He still thinks I'm 12.

1104
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:07,248
Which side do you want?

1105
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,253
I think the one closest
to the bathroom.

1106
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:12,464
I won't take up much room.

1107
01:06:23,058 --> 01:06:25,267
Take it between your thumb
and forefinger.

1108
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:29,064
Let every finger roll down
individually. That's it, yes.

1109
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:31,149
My goodness.

1110
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,444
You'll be all right.

1111
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,060
Special up here, isn't it?

1112
01:08:22,686 --> 01:08:24,187
I'm glad you came.

1113
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,567
Can I tell you something?

1114
01:08:28,692 --> 01:08:29,486
Sweetheart?

1115
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:32,488
Ron is on the phone.

1116
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:34,864
Hi. I'm sorry.

1117
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,159
- What, Dorothy?
- Nothing.

1118
01:08:38,662 --> 01:08:40,663
- I think I'll put her down.
- Good.

1119
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:43,875
Gets a little chilly out here.

1120
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:47,252
- No, I was just...
- I brought this sweater for you.

1121
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:49,464
Thank you.
Very nice of you, Les.

1122
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:50,673
Thank you.

1123
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:02,562
I wonder if we're going to get
any stars out of the sky tonight?

1124
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:04,064
I've got my stars.

1125
01:09:04,771 --> 01:09:06,567
You and Julie.

1126
01:09:36,264 --> 01:09:38,766
- It's beautiful.
- I should've transposed it.

1127
01:09:39,268 --> 01:09:41,186
It's wonderful for a lady
to play piano.

1128
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:42,896
Quit. Mama insisted.

1129
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:45,983
- Who wants another drink?
- You better take it easy.

1130
01:09:46,275 --> 01:09:47,694
- Remember Injun Joe.
- What's that?

1131
01:09:47,778 --> 01:09:49,195
Don't you tell that story.

1132
01:09:49,778 --> 01:09:52,365
- This bar Daddy hangs out in...
- I don't.

1133
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:55,159
He and Injun Joe threw back
a few too many.

1134
01:09:55,284 --> 01:09:56,077
Hard liquor.

1135
01:09:56,285 --> 01:09:57,871
They thought they saw this elk.

1136
01:09:58,288 --> 01:09:59,998
They stalked it for a couple hours.

1137
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,584
They cornered it up
against Charlie's barn.

1138
01:10:02,793 --> 01:10:05,796
About the time they were ready
to blast it, it mooed.

1139
01:10:06,296 --> 01:10:07,799
It was a cow?

1140
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:10,468
Enough laughing at your old man.

1141
01:10:10,802 --> 01:10:12,095
You know this one?

1142
01:10:15,765 --> 01:10:16,600
Wait a minute.

1143
01:10:45,297 --> 01:10:47,883
- Bravo!
- That was Julie's mother's name.

1144
01:10:48,299 --> 01:10:50,301
Mary Juliet Cooper.

1145
01:10:52,388 --> 01:10:53,764
Well, I'm going to bed.

1146
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:57,268
Do you wanna hit the hay,
as they say on the farm?

1147
01:10:57,768 --> 01:11:01,689
I think I'll... You and...
Both of you go to bed.

1148
01:11:01,898 --> 01:11:03,566
- I'll stay up.
- I'll stay with you.

1149
01:11:05,277 --> 01:11:06,487
Well, I'm going.

1150
01:11:06,902 --> 01:11:08,697
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.

1151
01:11:08,905 --> 01:11:09,991
Good night, Dad.

1152
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:11,868
Sleep well.

1153
01:11:12,785 --> 01:11:14,369
Be good.

1154
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:19,292
- Nice girl, isn't she?
- Very sweet.

1155
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:21,293
I'm kind of glad Ron didn't come up.

1156
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,879
You know I am too, actually.

1157
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,508
Really?

1158
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:28,677
- I'm sorry. Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

1159
01:11:28,886 --> 01:11:32,389
I thought you'd be more like
one of them "liberators."

1160
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:35,894
You know, I'm not really
like the woman on the show.

1161
01:11:36,394 --> 01:11:38,979
I mean, it's just a part.
I'm not that militant.

1162
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:41,481
Don't get me wrong.
I'm all for equality.

1163
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:45,486
Women ought to be entitled to
everything and all, et cetera.

1164
01:11:45,904 --> 01:11:46,988
Except...

1165
01:11:47,488 --> 01:11:50,784
...sometimes I think
what they really want is to be men.

1166
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:54,288
Like men are all equal
in the first place. We're not.

1167
01:11:54,996 --> 01:11:56,707
Can I get you another drink?

1168
01:11:56,874 --> 01:11:58,291
I must keep my wits tonight.

1169
01:11:58,374 --> 01:11:59,794
Tonight?

1170
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:01,169
Well, always.

1171
01:12:01,378 --> 01:12:02,587
I remember years ago...

1172
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,008
...there wasn't talk about
what a woman was, what a man was.

1173
01:12:06,385 --> 01:12:08,177
You just were what you were.

1174
01:12:08,886 --> 01:12:12,181
Now they have all this stuff about
being like the other sex...

1175
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:16,978
...so you can all be the same.
Well, I'm sorry, but we're just not.

1176
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,271
Not on a farm, anyway.

1177
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:22,610
Bulls are bulls,
and roosters don't try to lay eggs.

1178
01:12:22,902 --> 01:12:24,277
Never.

1179
01:12:27,907 --> 01:12:30,410
My wife and I, we were
married a lot of years.

1180
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,078
People got it all wrong.

1181
01:12:32,494 --> 01:12:34,790
They say your health
is the most important thing.

1182
01:12:34,998 --> 01:12:38,001
But I can lift this house off the
ground. What good is it?

1183
01:12:38,376 --> 01:12:39,710
Being with someone.

1184
01:12:40,002 --> 01:12:41,296
Sharing.

1185
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:44,384
That's what it's all about.

1186
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:48,305
- Julie says you're not married.
- No.

1187
01:12:49,012 --> 01:12:50,013
Like another drink?

1188
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:51,682
- No.
- You sure?

1189
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:56,186
Yes. Well, you know what?
I think it is about that time.

1190
01:12:56,979 --> 01:13:00,984
- Thanks for staying up and talking.
- Don't you mention it.

1191
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:05,780
You have beautiful eyes.

1192
01:13:05,988 --> 01:13:07,491
Oh, well, thank you.

1193
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:10,284
Good night, Les.

1194
01:13:57,795 --> 01:14:00,214
Daddy's a little out of
touch, isn't he?

1195
01:14:00,297 --> 01:14:02,091
No. Very sweet, very sweet.

1196
01:14:03,801 --> 01:14:06,387
He sees things pretty simply.

1197
01:14:07,805 --> 01:14:09,809
You're either happy or unhappy.

1198
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:11,684
Married or not married.

1199
01:14:13,312 --> 01:14:15,313
There's nothing in between.

1200
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:28,494
I tried to get him to take out
other women after Mama died but...

1201
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:32,581
You know, she must have been
a very special person.

1202
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:37,422
I guess so.
I don't remember her very well.

1203
01:14:38,297 --> 01:14:42,592
I remember her helping me
pick out this wallpaper.

1204
01:14:44,886 --> 01:14:48,515
I'd chosen one with great big,
purple flowers on it.

1205
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:50,684
And she said to me...

1206
01:14:50,894 --> 01:14:53,604
..."Just remember that once
you choose it...

1207
01:14:54,397 --> 01:14:58,610
...it's gonna cover the walls
of your room for a long, long time."

1208
01:14:59,903 --> 01:15:04,825
So I tried to imagine what those big,
purple flowers would look like...

1209
01:15:05,325 --> 01:15:07,619
...on all the walls of my room...

1210
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:10,707
...every night when I was
falling asleep...

1211
01:15:10,915 --> 01:15:13,418
...and every morning
when I was getting dressed.

1212
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:19,591
So I said to her,
"Which one would you choose, Mom?"

1213
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:26,221
And she said, "The one with
the daisies and the little rosebuds...

1214
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:31,188
...because daisies
are such homey flowers...

1215
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:37,108
...and rosebuds are so cheerful
and always waiting to bloom."

1216
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:39,987
That's lovely.

1217
01:15:41,907 --> 01:15:45,994
I made a million plans
looking at this wallpaper.

1218
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:53,710
I was always waiting
for these rosebuds to open.

1219
01:16:13,898 --> 01:16:15,693
That's nice.

1220
01:16:17,903 --> 01:16:21,615
My mother used to do that too,
sometimes.

1221
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:30,624
- Good night, Julie.
- Good night, Dottie.

1222
01:16:46,517 --> 01:16:48,393
Cathy Campbell,
please call your office.

1223
01:16:48,519 --> 01:16:50,604
It says "cool."

1224
01:16:51,522 --> 01:16:54,401
Don't you think I should be angry?
Doesn't it play better?

1225
01:16:54,525 --> 01:16:56,110
Yes. Why don't you try that?

1226
01:16:57,528 --> 01:17:00,532
This just came to
our dressing room for you.

1227
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:03,703
- I think it's from Julie's father.
- Oh, my!

1228
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:07,999
Now don't you dare eat any.
You don't want to ruin your cute figure.

1229
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,917
What a thoughtless present
to give a woman.

1230
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:11,793
Chocolates!

1231
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,130
Dorothy Michaels,
Rita Marshall's office.

1232
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:17,632
You're a complicated lady.

1233
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:21,429
On the one hand,
you're a real pain in the ass.

1234
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:25,224
I've got one of the most
expensive directors in soaps...

1235
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:27,311
I owe myself a quarter.

1236
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,316
And you've got him
defensive and hostile.

1237
01:17:30,523 --> 01:17:31,731
I don't mean to.

1238
01:17:32,024 --> 01:17:34,736
However, we're getting
2000 letters a week...

1239
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,906
...and we've picked up
three share points.

1240
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,826
And it's largely due to you.

1241
01:17:41,034 --> 01:17:44,205
You are the first woman character
who is her own person.

1242
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:47,834
Who asserts her own personality
without robbing someone of theirs.

1243
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,002
You're a breakthrough lady for us.

1244
01:17:50,502 --> 01:17:54,216
We're picking up your option for
another year. Congratulations.

1245
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:59,219
Come on, Mike. What do you mean,
get you out of it?

1246
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:01,932
There's no way out.
It's their option.

1247
01:18:02,139 --> 01:18:03,808
What? Who gave them that?

1248
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,019
You signed the standard contract.

1249
01:18:06,601 --> 01:18:10,315
But I didn't know I'd be working
for the rest of my life as a woman!

1250
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:12,108
You gotta make it work.

1251
01:18:12,608 --> 01:18:15,404
They'll pay. They'll go from
650 to 850 an episode.

1252
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:18,825
You get me out of this,
or I'll go in and tell them.

1253
01:18:19,116 --> 01:18:20,034
Tell them what?

1254
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:22,536
That you put a network on the spot?

1255
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:25,332
You're making a fool out of women?
They'll kill you!

1256
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,627
My secretary wants to be like
Dorothy Michaels. I want to fire her.

1257
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:34,424
We're talking major fraud here.
Major fraud! You can't tell them.

1258
01:18:35,135 --> 01:18:38,430
What about me? You think anybody
will believe I wasn't in on this?

1259
01:18:38,638 --> 01:18:42,518
It's not just ruining yourself.
This is ruining me too.

1260
01:18:43,017 --> 01:18:45,603
You can't do it.
You gotta make it work.

1261
01:18:46,603 --> 01:18:49,523
- Can you take that many Valium?
- We'll see.

1262
01:18:49,608 --> 01:18:51,943
Maybe your contract has
a morals clause.

1263
01:18:52,612 --> 01:18:56,615
If Dorothy did something filthy or
disgusting, they'd let you go.

1264
01:18:57,615 --> 01:19:02,538
But you've already done everything
filthy and disgusting on your show.

1265
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,922
Dorothy, it's Julie.

1266
01:19:12,132 --> 01:19:16,428
There's sort of an emergency.
Well, it's not really an emergency...

1267
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:19,516
...but if you get a chance,
would you call me?

1268
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,311
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- No, but I'm going to.

1269
01:19:23,643 --> 01:19:27,231
I've been fooling myself about Ron
for too long now.

1270
01:19:28,106 --> 01:19:31,527
I guess I really wanted you here
for moral support.

1271
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,822
Although I did fire Mrs. Crawley today.
I really did.

1272
01:19:35,615 --> 01:19:38,534
- Want a drink?
- I'm not the one breaking up with Ron.

1273
01:19:38,618 --> 01:19:40,120
I'd buy a ticket to that.

1274
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:44,207
You have influenced me though.
I've seen Ron through your eyes.

1275
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:47,045
Julie, I don't want
that responsibility.

1276
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:48,919
Why shouldn't you influence me?

1277
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,840
You wouldn't compromise your
feelings like I have...

1278
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:53,717
...or live this kind of lie.

1279
01:19:54,216 --> 01:19:55,599
Well, no, I wouldn't.
But...

1280
01:19:55,635 --> 01:19:58,013
Of course not. And you're right.
It's just...

1281
01:19:58,638 --> 01:20:01,934
I deserve something better.
I don't have to settle for this.

1282
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:06,523
But I've always been too lazy
or too scared or too something.

1283
01:20:07,232 --> 01:20:09,109
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1284
01:20:09,234 --> 01:20:11,320
What the hell?
I'll live, won't I?

1285
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:14,948
Maybe not happily, but honestly.

1286
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:16,617
Sounds like something you'd say.

1287
01:20:17,243 --> 01:20:22,039
You mustn't idealize me. Honesty,
in many ways, is a relative term.

1288
01:20:22,247 --> 01:20:23,625
My father's coming.

1289
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,419
If he calls, don't say
anything about this.

1290
01:20:26,712 --> 01:20:29,130
He's coming tonight.
He'll want to see you.

1291
01:20:29,213 --> 01:20:30,550
Me?

1292
01:20:31,216 --> 01:20:32,217
Oh, God!

1293
01:20:32,717 --> 01:20:33,927
It's Ron.

1294
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,722
Oh, Dorothy, God bless you.

1295
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:38,515
Wish me luck now.

1296
01:20:38,724 --> 01:20:40,016
Always.

1297
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:43,731
I feel that little moustache.
You should put some makeup on it.

1298
01:20:49,735 --> 01:20:51,238
How're you doing?

1299
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:54,705
What's going on?

1300
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:56,451
Dorothy's gonna sit with Amy.

1301
01:20:56,743 --> 01:20:58,830
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1302
01:21:00,748 --> 01:21:02,332
Hi, honey.

1303
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:06,420
You don't mind if I call you honey
when we're not working?

1304
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,138
Nice dress.

1305
01:21:15,722 --> 01:21:17,015
Thank you.

1306
01:21:18,225 --> 01:21:20,226
You don't like me, do you?

1307
01:21:20,727 --> 01:21:22,146
I can respect that...

1308
01:21:22,854 --> 01:21:26,650
...but there's not many women
I can't make like me.

1309
01:21:26,734 --> 01:21:28,527
Why don't you like me?

1310
01:21:29,237 --> 01:21:31,240
I don't like
the way you treat Julie.

1311
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,532
Oh?

1312
01:21:32,825 --> 01:21:37,037
I don't like the way you patronize her,
deceive her and lie to her.

1313
01:21:37,829 --> 01:21:38,623
What do you mean?

1314
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:39,957
You want me to go on?

1315
01:21:40,748 --> 01:21:42,751
No, I know what you mean.

1316
01:21:44,336 --> 01:21:49,134
Look, I never promised Julie I'd be
exclusive and not see other women.

1317
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:52,428
But I know she doesn't want
me to see them...

1318
01:21:52,846 --> 01:21:55,056
...so I lie to her
to keep from hurting her.

1319
01:21:55,724 --> 01:21:57,724
That's very convenient.

1320
01:21:58,225 --> 01:22:01,438
No, wait a minute.
Look at it from my side.

1321
01:22:01,855 --> 01:22:04,857
See, if a woman
wants me to seduce her...

1322
01:22:05,735 --> 01:22:06,736
...I usually do.

1323
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:12,159
But then she pretends I promised her
something. Then I pretend I did.

1324
01:22:12,325 --> 01:22:14,326
In the end, I'm the one
that's exploited.

1325
01:22:14,827 --> 01:22:16,454
Bullshit, Ron!

1326
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,456
You know what?

1327
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:21,543
I understand you a lot better
than you think I do.

1328
01:22:21,835 --> 01:22:22,919
Really?

1329
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,337
I'm ready.

1330
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,844
- Julie's ready.
- She sure is.

1331
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:33,932
Dorothy, she never wakes up.

1332
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:37,142
But if she does,
there's applesauce in the fridge.

1333
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,645
Give her a couple spoonfuls.

1334
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:42,440
I'm sure she...
Are you sure you'll be okay?

1335
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:46,027
Don't be silly. How much trouble
can a baby be? Go on.

1336
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,657
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.

1337
01:22:51,323 --> 01:22:54,245
Oh, please don't cry.
Please don't cry.

1338
01:22:55,829 --> 01:22:57,040
Oh, I love you.

1339
01:22:57,332 --> 01:22:59,124
Look how much fun we're having.

1340
01:23:02,961 --> 01:23:04,693
It's all right. It's all right.

1341
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,423
It's okay.
It's Uncle Dorothy.

1342
01:23:06,841 --> 01:23:09,843
Please don't cry.
Please don't cry. Please.

1343
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:13,724
Oh, come on.
Oh, here's funny clown.

1344
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:15,727
Funny clown's talking to...
Look.

1345
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:18,436
Come on, Amy.
Hello, Amy.

1346
01:23:18,853 --> 01:23:21,566
Amy...
Give me a break, will you?

1347
01:23:21,856 --> 01:23:25,153
Here, come on.
Will you eat some more now?

1348
01:23:25,444 --> 01:23:28,656
You told me to open up this one.
Now this is apri...

1349
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:35,454
Gotcha! Gotcha!

1350
01:23:35,829 --> 01:23:37,540
You want a little more apricot?

1351
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:40,754
Don't do that anymore.
Don't do that to Aunt Dorothy.

1352
01:23:40,837 --> 01:23:42,630
You'll go to sleep after this.

1353
01:23:42,964 --> 01:23:45,257
Just try this one,
and then I'll put you...

1354
01:23:47,426 --> 01:23:50,637
I don't like you.
It's not funny.

1355
01:23:51,348 --> 01:23:53,641
Amy, look at this.

1356
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:55,816
She'll have to paint the kitchen.

1357
01:23:55,852 --> 01:23:59,438
Here, look at yourself.
You see what a bad girl looks like?

1358
01:24:23,965 --> 01:24:25,343
Dorothy?

1359
01:24:27,468 --> 01:24:29,054
I'll be right there.

1360
01:24:33,433 --> 01:24:34,644
How's Amy? Any trouble?

1361
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:37,146
Oh, not at all.
She was an angel.

1362
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:39,149
Are you all right?

1363
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:40,858
Fine.

1364
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:54,664
What's the matter?

1365
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:11,559
Tell the truth now.
Are you sure you're all right?

1366
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,560
No.

1367
01:25:14,437 --> 01:25:15,437
Why?

1368
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,566
Who am I going to have dinner with?

1369
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:23,070
Oh, God! I hate myself
for being like this.

1370
01:25:28,034 --> 01:25:29,744
- You know something funny?
- What?

1371
01:25:30,037 --> 01:25:33,165
And I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

1372
01:25:33,957 --> 01:25:37,545
But since I met you, I'm so grateful
to have you as a friend.

1373
01:25:38,044 --> 01:25:39,672
And yet, at the same time...

1374
01:25:40,548 --> 01:25:43,467
...I've never felt lonelier
in my whole life.

1375
01:25:45,969 --> 01:25:50,349
It's as though I want something
that I just can't have.

1376
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:51,976
You know what I mean?

1377
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:00,654
Do you?

1378
01:26:08,578 --> 01:26:09,578
- Dorothy?
- Julie!

1379
01:26:10,037 --> 01:26:11,748
- My God!
- Let me explain.

1380
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:13,165
Don't say anything.

1381
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,377
- There's a reason.
- I understand.

1382
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:18,380
That's not the reason.
I'm not who you think I am.

1383
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:21,175
- Just wait a minute.
- Nobody is.

1384
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:22,800
- It's me.
- No, it's me.

1385
01:26:22,837 --> 01:26:24,054
- No, it's me.
- No, it's me.

1386
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,347
I'm not well-adjusted enough.

1387
01:26:26,555 --> 01:26:29,850
I'm sure I've got the same impulses.
Obviously, I did.

1388
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:32,978
Don't jump to conclusions about
that impulse.

1389
01:26:33,562 --> 01:26:36,274
If you could just see me
out of these clothes...

1390
01:26:36,565 --> 01:26:37,651
What? What?

1391
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:40,154
That's my father!
You've got to tell him.

1392
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,406
- Tell him.
- Tell him what?

1393
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:44,156
That I...
That's a corncob.

1394
01:26:46,575 --> 01:26:47,660
Hi, Dad.

1395
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,043
Fine.

1396
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,457
I'm here with Dorothy.

1397
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:54,877
I can't tonight, Daddy.
But wait.

1398
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:59,257
You've got to see him.
Just don't lead him on.

1399
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:02,678
- Please don't make me do this.
- You gotta let him down gently.

1400
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:05,348
- I can't.
- You owe me that.

1401
01:27:14,064 --> 01:27:17,151
Hi, Les.
I'm fine. How are you?

1402
01:27:18,152 --> 01:27:20,155
Tonight, sure.
Tonight?

1403
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,577
- What'll you have?
- Just water.

1404
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:28,078
- Water and bourbon.
- Make that a straight scotch.

1405
01:27:28,578 --> 01:27:30,249
Scotch and bourbon.

1406
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:32,752
I'd like to...

1407
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:34,545
- Let's dance.
- What?

1408
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,464
- It's my favorite dance.
- Oh, really, I don't dance.

1409
01:27:38,172 --> 01:27:39,175
- You'll love it.
- What?

1410
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:43,054
- Follow me. Follow me.
- Please, I don't...

1411
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:48,268
You know what? I'd...
Really, I'd rather not.

1412
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:52,773
- Just relax.
- You're very good.

1413
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:56,486
- My wife and I took a course.
- I could tell at once.

1414
01:27:57,652 --> 01:28:00,156
- Emily, we love you.
- You're fabulous!

1415
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:01,949
- Just wonderful.
- Wonderful.

1416
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:04,785
- You're even prettier in person.
- Thank you.

1417
01:28:08,665 --> 01:28:11,460
I'm sorry. I forgot that
you're on your feet all day.

1418
01:28:11,668 --> 01:28:14,588
- Come on, sit down.
- Yes, I think we should stop.

1419
01:28:16,173 --> 01:28:17,883
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1420
01:28:18,257 --> 01:28:20,386
I was happy you could
come out tonight.

1421
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:23,265
I know you usually
got a lot of lines to learn.

1422
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:27,268
- There's something I'd better say.
- I want to say something too.

1423
01:28:27,686 --> 01:28:30,481
Wouldn't it be funny
if we both said the same thing?

1424
01:28:30,771 --> 01:28:32,565
It'd be hilarious.
But I doubt it.

1425
01:28:32,773 --> 01:28:37,571
Well, mine's pretty simple.
I'm not too good with words anyway.

1426
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:40,991
I only took two pictures in my life...

1427
01:28:41,158 --> 01:28:43,952
...my high-school graduation
and my wedding.

1428
01:28:44,662 --> 01:28:46,580
My wife stood next to me in both.

1429
01:28:46,663 --> 01:28:50,167
I never thought I'd want anybody
to fill her place.

1430
01:28:50,752 --> 01:28:52,168
That changed last weekend.

1431
01:28:52,205 --> 01:28:52,962
- Lester.
- Lesley.

1432
01:28:53,253 --> 01:28:54,757
- Lesley...
- Don't interrupt me.

1433
01:28:55,257 --> 01:28:57,466
I gotta do this in one go
or I won't do it.

1434
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,679
I know this is kind of quick,
but that's how I am.

1435
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:04,058
Never did believe in
not getting down to it.

1436
01:29:04,767 --> 01:29:06,183
Don't say anything now...

1437
01:29:06,685 --> 01:29:09,480
I know it's fast.
But take time to think about it.

1438
01:29:09,771 --> 01:29:12,774
If you say no, at least I'll feel
you took me seriously.

1439
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:15,362
Would you mind?
I just need to be alone.

1440
01:29:15,778 --> 01:29:18,658
I'd like to start thinking it over
as soon as possible.

1441
01:29:24,287 --> 01:29:25,455
Dorothy?

1442
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:29,168
This is a nightmare.

1443
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:31,879
Don't be angry.
I had to talk to you.

1444
01:29:32,255 --> 01:29:34,464
- How'd you know where I live?
- I followed you.

1445
01:29:34,757 --> 01:29:38,886
- What? Followed me home?
- I didn't have the courage to phone you.

1446
01:29:39,262 --> 01:29:43,182
- Could I come up for a drink?
- No, you can't! I have a headache.

1447
01:29:43,265 --> 01:29:46,979
Please! I'll only take
a tiny moment of your time.

1448
01:29:47,771 --> 01:29:51,859
I'll see you on the set tomorrow
and we'll talk about it.

1449
01:29:53,276 --> 01:29:55,196
Go home.
Have you been drinking?

1450
01:30:24,269 --> 01:30:27,772
Shh! Are you out of your
cotton-picking mind?

1451
01:30:28,397 --> 01:30:30,483
Come on up!
I'm on the third floor!

1452
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:33,486
Hurry before someone
calls the cops!

1453
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:35,195
Jesus!

1454
01:30:38,783 --> 01:30:40,787
Come in, but you can
just stay a minute.

1455
01:30:41,287 --> 01:30:45,082
Can I have a drink?
Anything alcoholic will do.

1456
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:49,671
- Just one drink and I'll go.
- Oh, all right, but I...

1457
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,173
Nice mirror.

1458
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,267
Here.

1459
01:31:02,392 --> 01:31:04,769
What is it that couldn't wait?

1460
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:09,275
I'm just an untalented
old has-been.

1461
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:11,241
Were you ever famous?

1462
01:31:11,277 --> 01:31:14,572
- No.
- Then how can you be a has-been?

1463
01:31:14,864 --> 01:31:18,201
I love the way you never let me
get away with anything.

1464
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:22,998
- Dorothy...
- Yes?

1465
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:25,292
- I want you.
- Pardon?

1466
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:29,963
- I've never wanted a woman this much!
- Please! Perhaps another time.

1467
01:31:30,381 --> 01:31:31,883
Turn me away, it'll kill me!

1468
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:35,177
- I don't want emotional involvement.
- I'll take sex.

1469
01:31:35,386 --> 01:31:37,306
- I don't want to hurt you.
- I don't mind.

1470
01:31:37,389 --> 01:31:38,474
Oh, shit!

1471
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:49,192
John Van Horn, Jeff Slater.

1472
01:31:50,403 --> 01:31:52,697
Jeff Slater, John Van Horn.

1473
01:31:53,489 --> 01:31:54,282
How do you do?

1474
01:31:54,406 --> 01:31:55,366
How do you do?

1475
01:31:56,866 --> 01:32:00,078
- I'll be going.
- I think it's best.

1476
01:32:04,877 --> 01:32:07,795
- Gee, I hope I haven't...
- No, I hope I haven't...

1477
01:32:08,881 --> 01:32:11,801
I want you to know, for the record...

1478
01:32:12,385 --> 01:32:15,095
...that nothing happened here tonight.

1479
01:32:18,892 --> 01:32:20,768
Thank you, John.

1480
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:25,690
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

1481
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,903
I didn't understand.
I'm really sorry.

1482
01:32:30,987 --> 01:32:32,407
Please don't talk about this.

1483
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:33,990
My lips are sealed.

1484
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,792
You slut!

1485
01:32:44,002 --> 01:32:47,005
Look, don't start in with me.
Don't do that.

1486
01:32:47,505 --> 01:32:49,799
Rape is not a laughing matter.

1487
01:32:51,008 --> 01:32:52,177
That guy wanted me.

1488
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,598
You cannot believe
the night I have had tonight!

1489
01:32:55,973 --> 01:32:58,183
- I think I can imagine.
- No, you can't.

1490
01:32:58,475 --> 01:33:00,103
I saw his eyes.
I was in trouble.

1491
01:33:00,477 --> 01:33:03,605
If you don't come in,
I'm in the Daily News the next day.

1492
01:33:03,897 --> 01:33:05,398
How did you ever let him in?

1493
01:33:05,482 --> 01:33:08,193
What do you mean?
He was singing.

1494
01:33:08,902 --> 01:33:11,196
- Is he that good a singer?
- What do you..?

1495
01:33:11,405 --> 01:33:12,407
That's him!

1496
01:33:12,491 --> 01:33:14,992
Say I'm in the bedroom crying.
Don't let him in!

1497
01:33:15,494 --> 01:33:16,411
Michael.

1498
01:33:16,995 --> 01:33:17,959
It's Sandy.

1499
01:33:17,996 --> 01:33:19,706
Sandy?
It's Sandy?

1500
01:33:19,998 --> 01:33:22,083
I can't let her see me like this.

1501
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,878
I hear you in there.

1502
01:33:25,003 --> 01:33:27,798
Open the door. It's me, Sandy.
Open the door!

1503
01:33:28,507 --> 01:33:29,883
- Sandy, is that you?
- Yes!

1504
01:33:30,008 --> 01:33:33,013
What time is it?
I fell asleep, I guess.

1505
01:33:33,513 --> 01:33:35,974
I was having a nightmare
and you were in it.

1506
01:33:36,475 --> 01:33:37,601
Mike's in the shower.

1507
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:40,688
I'm in the shower!
I got soap in my eyes!

1508
01:33:41,104 --> 01:33:44,400
I'm not dressed.
I was asleep. I was dreaming.

1509
01:33:44,483 --> 01:33:46,695
You were in my dream.
You had big teeth.

1510
01:33:47,486 --> 01:33:48,485
I had big what?

1511
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:51,199
- I gotta get something on.
- Are you having a party?

1512
01:33:52,492 --> 01:33:54,412
I'm in the shower!
Turn on the water!

1513
01:33:54,494 --> 01:33:59,205
It's stuck! I got soap in my eyes
and there's no water coming out!

1514
01:33:59,498 --> 01:34:01,501
I can't come out
with soap in my eyes!

1515
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,877
Open the door!

1516
01:34:05,004 --> 01:34:08,093
I can hear you in there, you guys.
Open the door!

1517
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:12,804
- Open this door.
- The door was open.

1518
01:34:13,096 --> 01:34:14,891
You must think I'm really stupid.

1519
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:16,808
No one would say it to your face.

1520
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:20,981
I've been out there for 10 minutes.
It sounded like a party in here.

1521
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:24,110
Well, Mike was in the shower.
You know.

1522
01:34:24,484 --> 01:34:27,279
- Hi, I was taking a shower.
- He was in the shower.

1523
01:34:27,613 --> 01:34:29,197
- Good shower?
- Good shower.

1524
01:34:29,489 --> 01:34:31,701
Why haven't you returned
my phone calls?

1525
01:34:31,993 --> 01:34:34,120
I'll go do some writing.
Excuse me.

1526
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:37,580
Wait, I'll be back.
I got a present for you.

1527
01:34:38,082 --> 01:34:38,963
Pigs!

1528
01:34:38,999 --> 01:34:42,586
I'm glad you came over.
I've been meaning to give this to you.

1529
01:34:43,087 --> 01:34:46,507
- I suppose this means nothing's wrong?
- Nothing is. Is it?

1530
01:34:47,091 --> 01:34:50,011
I've called you all week
and you haven't called back.

1531
01:34:50,095 --> 01:34:52,014
- You treat me like I'm a jerk.
- What?

1532
01:34:52,598 --> 01:34:55,183
- I called and you didn't call back!
- No, it's...

1533
01:34:55,601 --> 01:34:59,106
My new answering machine is no good.
I'll answer my own calls.

1534
01:34:59,605 --> 01:35:04,402
- I went to six stores for your favorite.
- Chocolate-covered cherries?

1535
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:06,612
That's sweet.
Oh, and a card.

1536
01:35:07,112 --> 01:35:09,616
Oh, yeah. No, no!
Don't, don't read it!

1537
01:35:10,115 --> 01:35:11,994
I was very angry when I wrote that!

1538
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:14,788
"Thank you for the lovely night
in front of the fire.

1539
01:35:15,122 --> 01:35:16,707
Missing you, Les."

1540
01:35:19,585 --> 01:35:21,920
This isn't for me.
It's another girl's candy.

1541
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:25,007
I wouldn't give you
another girl's candy.

1542
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:26,717
- Then, whose is it?
- Mine.

1543
01:35:28,093 --> 01:35:29,805
A guy named Les sends you candy?

1544
01:35:30,097 --> 01:35:33,807
Yes. He's a friend of mine.
He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.

1545
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:37,604
Why is he thanking you for
a lovely night in front of the fire?

1546
01:35:39,106 --> 01:35:40,398
My mind's a blank.

1547
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:45,321
Are you gay?

1548
01:35:47,114 --> 01:35:48,615
In what sense?

1549
01:35:48,698 --> 01:35:51,993
Just be honest with me.
For once in your life tell the truth!

1550
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:55,916
Because these stories
are very demeaning to me.

1551
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,501
No matter how bad the truth is...

1552
01:35:59,085 --> 01:36:01,921
...it doesn't tear you apart inside
like dishonesty.

1553
01:36:02,589 --> 01:36:06,009
At least it leaves you with
some self-respect and some dignity.

1554
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:08,011
You're right.

1555
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,392
Okay. Okay.

1556
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,313
I'm not gonna lie to you anymore.

1557
01:36:18,188 --> 01:36:20,525
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Sandy...

1558
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,612
I'm in love with another woman.

1559
01:36:25,698 --> 01:36:26,989
What are you saying?!

1560
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,200
- Sandy, please. Don't...
- You liar!

1561
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:30,994
We never said "I love you."

1562
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:33,206
- We went to bed one time.
- I don't care.

1563
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:37,210
You're a dear friend. But let's not
pretend it was something else!

1564
01:36:37,711 --> 01:36:39,091
We're gonna lose everything!

1565
01:36:39,128 --> 01:36:42,213
I don't care about "I love you!"
I read The Second Sex...

1566
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,510
...and The Cinderella Complex!
I'm responsible for my own orgasms!

1567
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:48,512
I just don't like to be lied to!

1568
01:36:49,097 --> 01:36:51,392
You asked me
to be straight with you.

1569
01:36:51,601 --> 01:36:53,519
I didn't say
how I'd feel about it.

1570
01:36:53,727 --> 01:36:56,729
- What can I do?
- There's nothing you can do for me.

1571
01:36:57,231 --> 01:36:59,024
I just have to feel like this...

1572
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:01,820
...and you have to know
you made me feel this way!

1573
01:37:02,194 --> 01:37:03,822
- Aren't we still friends?
- No!

1574
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:07,201
I don't take this shit from friends,
only from lovers.

1575
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:10,119
- Wait, what about the play?
- What about it?

1576
01:37:10,202 --> 01:37:12,414
I should tell you to shove your play.

1577
01:37:12,705 --> 01:37:15,709
But I won't, because
I never allow personal despair...

1578
01:37:16,293 --> 01:37:18,212
...to ruin my
professional commitments.

1579
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,505
I am a professional actress!

1580
01:37:22,216 --> 01:37:25,720
So, are these real
chocolate-covered cherries?

1581
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,306
I think so.

1582
01:37:29,723 --> 01:37:31,894
- See you at rehearsal.
- Oh, Sandy...

1583
01:37:32,227 --> 01:37:33,896
Don't call me.

1584
01:37:35,522 --> 01:37:37,524
It's 2 a.m.
Can't this wait?

1585
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:40,318
I don't care.
Get me off this show in 10 days.

1586
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:43,613
- It's impossible.
- Then I'm getting a new agent.

1587
01:37:44,197 --> 01:37:46,201
You hurt my feelings.
What happened?

1588
01:37:46,326 --> 01:37:49,329
I told her about Julie.
She thinks I'm gay.

1589
01:37:49,704 --> 01:37:52,207
- Julie thinks your gay?
- No, my friend Sandy.

1590
01:37:52,707 --> 01:37:53,917
Well, sleep with her.

1591
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:57,503
- I did and she still thinks I'm gay.
- Oh, that's not so good.

1592
01:37:57,795 --> 01:38:00,924
I gotta get back to my life.
You got lots of lawyers...

1593
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,802
...there must be a way to get
me out of this show.

1594
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:07,597
- We've been through this.
- Why can't Dorothy have an accident?

1595
01:38:07,806 --> 01:38:10,435
We can use our imaginations.
This isn't too tough.

1596
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:14,313
Kill somebody and bring back the stiff,
but she'd better look like you.

1597
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:18,233
- They don't miss a trick.
- These are nice, good people.

1598
01:38:18,818 --> 01:38:22,532
Since when do you care so much
about what other people feel?

1599
01:38:22,822 --> 01:38:26,410
You should have seen Julie's face
when she thought I was a lesbian.

1600
01:38:27,328 --> 01:38:29,038
Lesbian?
You just said "gay."

1601
01:38:29,204 --> 01:38:31,622
Sandy thinks I'm gay.
Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.

1602
01:38:31,707 --> 01:38:34,002
- I thought Dorothy was straight.
- She is.

1603
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:37,630
Les, the sweetest man in the world,
asked me to marry him.

1604
01:38:38,339 --> 01:38:40,133
A guy named Les
wants to marry you?

1605
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,134
Yeah.
No, wants to marry Dorothy.

1606
01:38:42,301 --> 01:38:44,511
- He knows she's a lesbian?
- She's not!

1607
01:38:44,803 --> 01:38:46,932
- I know that, but does he?
- Know what?

1608
01:38:47,307 --> 01:38:49,309
That...
Well, I don't know.

1609
01:38:49,811 --> 01:38:53,231
You know he gave me a ring?
He gave me a diamond ring.

1610
01:38:53,314 --> 01:38:54,816
What did you say?

1611
01:38:55,316 --> 01:38:56,733
"I got to think it over."

1612
01:38:56,817 --> 01:39:00,237
I went in the ladies' room
and almost pissed in the sink.

1613
01:39:01,405 --> 01:39:03,408
Thirteen's up.
Ready 14.

1614
01:39:03,445 --> 01:39:05,409
Widen E.
Pull three to 130.

1615
01:39:06,412 --> 01:39:08,204
- Cut it.
- Stop tape.

1616
01:39:08,913 --> 01:39:11,416
We're gonna take
a short break, people.

1617
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:15,504
Hold it, hold it!
Slight change of plans, children.

1618
01:39:15,837 --> 01:39:19,132
Our future ex-tape editor spilled
a bottle of celery tonic...

1619
01:39:19,841 --> 01:39:22,428
...on the second reel
of the show airing today.

1620
01:39:22,805 --> 01:39:25,223
So we have to redo
Emily's party scene, live.

1621
01:39:25,306 --> 01:39:27,141
- Live?
- Quick, like bunnies.

1622
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:29,309
You have 26 minutes.
Get into wardrobe.

1623
01:39:29,811 --> 01:39:32,230
- But Rita...
- You've only got a few lines.

1624
01:39:32,313 --> 01:39:35,026
Well, I don't see
why we can't use the tape.

1625
01:39:35,316 --> 01:39:37,735
Just because it's a little sticky.

1626
01:39:44,828 --> 01:39:48,832
Explain to them that
the hours have to be flexible.

1627
01:39:49,331 --> 01:39:53,544
No...
And I would...

1628
01:39:57,926 --> 01:40:00,720
Can I call you back?
Thank you.

1629
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:08,227
My God, Dorothy! I just...
Really, I can't.

1630
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:09,811
It's for Amy.

1631
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:12,731
Oh, thanks.

1632
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:14,444
That's nice.

1633
01:40:14,944 --> 01:40:17,821
- I don't know how to say this...
- I wish you wouldn't.

1634
01:40:18,947 --> 01:40:23,243
I understand that you weren't able
to tell my dad last night.

1635
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:28,333
So it'd be better for all of us
if I tried to explain it to him.

1636
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:31,835
Look, I wouldn't be honest
if I didn't tell you...

1637
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:36,049
...how much you've meant to me
these past couple weeks.

1638
01:40:36,424 --> 01:40:41,346
You taught me how to stand up
for myself because you always do.

1639
01:40:42,432 --> 01:40:45,934
You taught me to stop hiding
and just be myself...

1640
01:40:46,435 --> 01:40:48,520
...because you're always yourself.

1641
01:40:49,939 --> 01:40:51,148
I'm grateful to you.

1642
01:40:54,026 --> 01:40:55,027
But...

1643
01:40:56,529 --> 01:40:58,447
Well, I just...

1644
01:40:59,031 --> 01:41:02,119
I just can't see you anymore,
you know?

1645
01:41:05,414 --> 01:41:10,337
I just feel it would be leading you on.
It wouldn't be fair to you.

1646
01:41:12,421 --> 01:41:14,923
I really love you, Dorothy.

1647
01:41:15,423 --> 01:41:17,219
But I can't...

1648
01:41:17,926 --> 01:41:19,722
I can't love you.

1649
01:41:19,929 --> 01:41:22,015
Places, everybody.
Immediately!

1650
01:41:22,933 --> 01:41:25,435
Fifteen seconds to commercial.

1651
01:41:26,936 --> 01:41:28,729
I don't care how you get there.

1652
01:41:29,022 --> 01:41:31,648
This is the most important night
in Emily's life.

1653
01:41:31,941 --> 01:41:36,322
We're all going to be there
to honor her, including you.

1654
01:41:42,619 --> 01:41:44,747
Stand by.
Quiet, please, on the floor.

1655
01:41:45,331 --> 01:41:46,122
Stand by.

1656
01:41:46,247 --> 01:41:49,125
Twenty-two and 23
come down to 18.

1657
01:41:49,754 --> 01:41:51,046
Hold it.
That's good.

1658
01:41:51,255 --> 01:41:54,133
Five, four, three...

1659
01:41:59,221 --> 01:42:03,852
Let's raise our glasses to our
guest of honor, Ms. Emily Kimberly.

1660
01:42:06,729 --> 01:42:10,734
We're looking forward to having
you grace us with your presence...

1661
01:42:11,235 --> 01:42:13,737
...for many years to come.

1662
01:42:18,242 --> 01:42:21,536
Thank you, Gordon.
I can't tell you all how moved I am.

1663
01:42:21,745 --> 01:42:23,330
I never in my wildest dreams...

1664
01:42:23,746 --> 01:42:28,419
...imagined that I would be the object
of so much genuine affection.

1665
01:42:35,717 --> 01:42:39,722
It makes it more difficult for
me to say what I'm now going to say.

1666
01:42:42,352 --> 01:42:45,355
I do feel it's time
to set the record straight.

1667
01:42:45,731 --> 01:42:48,357
I didn't come here
just as an administrator.

1668
01:42:48,732 --> 01:42:51,152
I came to this hospital
to settle a score.

1669
01:42:51,319 --> 01:42:52,153
What score?

1670
01:42:52,819 --> 01:42:54,739
My father built
this hospital.

1671
01:42:54,823 --> 01:42:56,448
But to his family...

1672
01:42:56,824 --> 01:43:00,036
...he was an unmerciful tyrant.
An absolute dodo bird.

1673
01:43:00,329 --> 01:43:01,329
Oh, no! Not live.

1674
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:03,227
Let's see where she goes.

1675
01:43:03,263 --> 01:43:04,625
He drove my mother to drink.

1676
01:43:04,833 --> 01:43:07,836
In fact, she went riding one time
and lost all her teeth.

1677
01:43:08,253 --> 01:43:09,631
What? What?

1678
01:43:10,337 --> 01:43:13,844
- the oldest daughter, the pretty,
charming one, became pregnant...

1679
01:43:14,344 --> 01:43:16,928
...at 15 and was driven
out of the house.

1680
01:43:17,346 --> 01:43:22,143
She was so terrified that her daughter
would bear the stigma of illegitimacy...

1681
01:43:22,352 --> 01:43:26,440
...she changed her name and contracted
a disfiguring disease...

1682
01:43:30,861 --> 01:43:34,823
...after moving to Tangiers, where
she raised the girl as her sister.

1683
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:37,242
But her one ambition...

1684
01:43:37,326 --> 01:43:39,246
Any preference of shots
on this one?

1685
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:41,956
- was to become a nurse.

1686
01:43:42,332 --> 01:43:45,962
So she returned to the States
and joined the staff right here...

1687
01:43:46,336 --> 01:43:47,836
...at Southwest General.

1688
01:43:48,838 --> 01:43:50,757
She worked here
and had to speak out...

1689
01:43:50,841 --> 01:43:53,428
...wherever she saw injustice
and inhumanity.

1690
01:43:53,845 --> 01:43:56,263
Don't you understand that,
Dr. Brewster?

1691
01:43:56,347 --> 01:43:57,555
I never laid a hand on her.

1692
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:00,727
Yes, you did. She was shunned
by all you nurses too.

1693
01:44:01,351 --> 01:44:03,063
Give me something, one.
Not backs.

1694
01:44:03,354 --> 01:44:05,648
Two and three go left and right.

1695
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:07,733
No, two go left!
Three go right!

1696
01:44:07,942 --> 01:44:10,445
Her outspokenness threatened
you doctors.

1697
01:44:10,862 --> 01:44:14,532
But she was deeply, deeply,
deeply loved...

1698
01:44:14,949 --> 01:44:16,661
...by her brother.
- Her brother?

1699
01:44:16,953 --> 01:44:19,329
This brother,
on the day of her death...

1700
01:44:19,454 --> 01:44:22,958
...swore to the good Lord above
he'd follow in her footsteps.

1701
01:44:23,334 --> 01:44:25,544
And, and, and...

1702
01:44:27,463 --> 01:44:29,631
...just, just, just...

1703
01:44:31,343 --> 01:44:33,052
Don't, don't, don't panic.

1704
01:44:33,346 --> 01:44:36,556
...owe it all up to her!
But on her terms!

1705
01:44:36,931 --> 01:44:37,933
Here come the terms.

1706
01:44:37,969 --> 01:44:39,559
As a woman...

1707
01:44:39,935 --> 01:44:42,938
...and just as proud to be a woman...

1708
01:44:43,939 --> 01:44:45,231
...as she ever was...

1709
01:44:47,945 --> 01:44:50,529
...for I am not Emily Kimberly...

1710
01:44:50,863 --> 01:44:53,659
...the daughter of Dwayne...

1711
01:44:54,450 --> 01:44:56,827
...and Alma Kimberly.

1712
01:44:57,954 --> 01:44:58,956
No, I'm not.

1713
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,960
I'm Edward Kimberly,
Anthea's reckless brother.

1714
01:45:04,962 --> 01:45:06,046
Holy Christ!

1715
01:45:07,965 --> 01:45:11,552
Edward Kimberly, who's finally
vindicated his sister's good name.

1716
01:45:11,969 --> 01:45:13,054
I'm Edward Kimberly.

1717
01:45:13,929 --> 01:45:15,395
Edward Kimberly.

1718
01:45:15,431 --> 01:45:18,559
- I'll be damned.
- I'm not mentally ill, but proud...

1719
01:45:18,935 --> 01:45:22,855
...and lucky to be the woman
that was the best part of my manhood.

1720
01:45:24,442 --> 01:45:25,735
The best part of myself.

1721
01:45:26,943 --> 01:45:29,738
That is one nutty hospital.

1722
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:33,032
I knew there was a reason
she didn't like me!

1723
01:45:33,451 --> 01:45:34,242
Cut it!

1724
01:45:34,952 --> 01:45:35,745
Cut!

1725
01:45:53,055 --> 01:45:54,348
Does Jeff know?

1726
01:46:47,571 --> 01:46:48,865
Hey, Robert.

1727
01:46:58,540 --> 01:46:59,543
Hi, Les.

1728
01:47:01,045 --> 01:47:02,046
Get him!

1729
01:47:04,049 --> 01:47:05,174
All right!

1730
01:47:07,552 --> 01:47:10,680
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Oh, come on.

1731
01:47:52,682 --> 01:47:55,563
- I thought you'd want it back.
- Outside.

1732
01:47:56,062 --> 01:47:58,065
Give it to me outside.

1733
01:48:09,659 --> 01:48:11,245
Why'd you do it?

1734
01:48:12,662 --> 01:48:14,249
I needed the work.

1735
01:48:17,167 --> 01:48:20,753
The only reason you're still living is
because I never kissed you.

1736
01:48:23,173 --> 01:48:25,469
I hope you enjoyed the chocolates.

1737
01:48:27,179 --> 01:48:29,055
I gave them to a girl.

1738
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:31,266
So did I. I thought.

1739
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,477
Do you like them?

1740
01:48:34,685 --> 01:48:36,271
- Chocolates?
- Girls!

1741
01:48:37,647 --> 01:48:39,777
I like Julie.

1742
01:48:41,652 --> 01:48:43,570
I think I love Julie.

1743
01:48:44,154 --> 01:48:46,366
Wearing a dress is
a funny way to show it.

1744
01:48:46,658 --> 01:48:48,868
I know. I apologize.

1745
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:57,960
The truth is,
you were okay company.

1746
01:48:59,171 --> 01:49:00,672
So were you.

1747
01:49:00,756 --> 01:49:02,884
I could have done
without the dancing.

1748
01:49:03,677 --> 01:49:05,679
You know, you're very good.

1749
01:49:07,179 --> 01:49:10,476
- I'm seeing a real nice woman now.
- Oh, really?

1750
01:49:11,683 --> 01:49:13,561
You think I didn't check her out?

1751
01:49:16,689 --> 01:49:18,483
Can I buy you a beer?

1752
01:49:21,153 --> 01:49:22,987
You got six bits.
Yeah.

1753
01:49:24,656 --> 01:49:26,450
Can I have a couple of beers?

1754
01:49:31,663 --> 01:49:33,876
Does Julie ever mention me?

1755
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:47,892
Taxi!

1756
01:49:54,772 --> 01:49:55,856
Thank you.

1757
01:50:29,769 --> 01:50:30,769
Hi.

1758
01:50:33,271 --> 01:50:35,274
I saw your father.

1759
01:50:37,275 --> 01:50:40,695
I drove up to see him
in that bar he hangs out at.

1760
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:42,657
He doesn't hang out there.

1761
01:50:42,781 --> 01:50:45,368
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

1762
01:50:46,786 --> 01:50:48,872
- How's Amy?
- Fine.

1763
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:54,587
Your dad and I had a couple of beers
and shot a good game of pool.

1764
01:50:54,795 --> 01:50:57,798
We had a really good time together.

1765
01:51:00,258 --> 01:51:01,469
How's it going?

1766
01:51:04,765 --> 01:51:06,683
Terry Bishop's back on the show.

1767
01:51:06,766 --> 01:51:08,268
April lost her license...

1768
01:51:08,768 --> 01:51:11,563
- I meant with you.
- I know what you meant.

1769
01:51:16,775 --> 01:51:19,197
So you're pretty hot
after your unveiling.

1770
01:51:19,779 --> 01:51:21,197
What's your next triumph?

1771
01:51:21,282 --> 01:51:23,284
I'm going to do this play with...

1772
01:51:23,367 --> 01:51:24,994
Good. I've gotta catch a cab.

1773
01:51:27,287 --> 01:51:31,000
Can I call you sometime?

1774
01:51:35,882 --> 01:51:37,966
Look, I don't want to hold you up.

1775
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,972
I just did it for the work.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1776
01:51:43,764 --> 01:51:45,265
Especially you.

1777
01:51:57,361 --> 01:51:59,281
I miss Dorothy.

1778
01:52:01,866 --> 01:52:03,870
You don't have to.

1779
01:52:04,369 --> 01:52:05,495
She's right here.

1780
01:52:08,372 --> 01:52:09,792
And she misses you.

1781
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:16,801
Look, you don't know me from Adam.

1782
01:52:17,384 --> 01:52:21,387
But I was a better man with you,
as a woman...

1783
01:52:21,887 --> 01:52:24,475
...than I ever was with a woman,
as a man.

1784
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:26,477
You know what I mean?

1785
01:52:29,396 --> 01:52:33,276
I just gotta learn to do it
without the dress.

1786
01:52:37,906 --> 01:52:41,201
At this point, there might be
an advantage to my wearing pants.

1787
01:52:47,374 --> 01:52:50,502
The hard part's over,
you know?

1788
01:52:51,379 --> 01:52:53,589
We were already...

1789
01:52:54,382 --> 01:52:56,007
...good friends.

1790
01:53:05,977 --> 01:53:08,979
Will you loan me
that little yellow outfit?

1791
01:53:10,483 --> 01:53:11,401
Which one?

1792
01:53:12,985 --> 01:53:14,986
- The Halston.
- The Halston?

1793
01:53:15,487 --> 01:53:16,987
Oh, no!

1794
01:53:17,489 --> 01:53:19,198
You'll ruin it.

1795
01:53:19,992 --> 01:53:22,287
- You'll spill wine all over it.
- I will not.

1796
01:53:22,995 --> 01:53:27,292
I'll loan it to you, but you gotta
give it back. It's my favorite...

1797
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,085
What are you gonna use it for?
