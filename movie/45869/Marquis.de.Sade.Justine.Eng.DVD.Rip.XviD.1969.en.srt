1
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,375
This is the story of Justine...

2
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:03,072
...and misfortunes of virtue.

3
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:17,016
JUSTINE DE SADE.

4
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,187
Poor children.
- Poor Juliet.

5
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,287
Poor Justine.

6
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,347
Were they preventable?

7
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,307
Bring Justine and Juliette.

8
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,407
Yes, Mother.

9
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,307
Justine. Juliet.

10
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,707
The Mother Superior do it talk to you.

11
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,807
Go see it immediately.

12
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:55,877
I wonder what happens.

13
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,427
It has done nothing wrong.

14
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:01,147
Speak for yourself.
You're too good to be true.

15
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,027
To do evil is not dangerous as long as
is not found.

16
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:06,227
Juliet.

17
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:08,853
Do not be offended,
it's true.

18
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:13,458
They lived in a convent.
Two Sisters.

19
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:17,267
Totally opposite in appearance, character...

20
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,187
...and expectations.

21
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:21,287
In truth,

22
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,695
Not meet the virtuous but briars...

23
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,747
...when the wicked...

24
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:29,009
...only gather as roses.

25
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:32,371
My children, I very sad news.

26
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:33,557
A week ago, its...

27
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,427
...usurers drove your father
out of the country...

28
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:40,437
...and yesterday in your
mother died of grief.

29
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,167
You must be courageous.

30
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,867
You mean we are without parents...

31
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,267
...or fortune?

32
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,227
Not quite.

33
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:54,987
Some friends of your family you leave each
hundred crowns.

34
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:58,572
A sum that should help you in this event.

35
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:03,322
When will we get money?
- With immediate effect.

36
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:06,707
Alas, my poor child,
it will not be enough...

37
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,731
...to allow you to stay with us.

38
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:12,147
You must leave today.

39
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,330
Go? But where will we go?

40
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,487
Do not worry,

41
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,362
I have a friend who will help us.

42
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:23,347
Do not forget what we've learned.

43
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,867
I promise, my Mother.

44
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,707
The only thing I've learned
is to take care of myself...

45
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,667
...because nobody else will.

46
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,532
Come on.

47
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:41,112
For the Blessed Virgin,
what will they become?

48
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,787
Oyez, citizens.
Any person infringing this law...

49
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:48,049
...be put to death.

50
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:51,627
It is granted the right to
all beggars and destitute...

51
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:53,587
...to stay...

52
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,816
...or to freely the city walls.

53
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,027
Violators will be publicly whipped,

54
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:03,256
taken to the gallows and executed.

55
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,827
Can I help you, ladies?

56
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:10,187
We seek the house of Madame de Buisson.

57
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:12,067
On your right.

58
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,167
Are you sure?

59
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,867
This is one of the most famous houses
Paris.

60
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,967
What he meant?

61
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,787
I am Madame de Buisson?

62
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,174
Yes, come, my darlings.

63
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,177
Ladies two new boarders.

64
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:45,602
A little shy, but it will pass.

65
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,467
My name is Juliet...

66
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,457
...and this is my sister, Justine.

67
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:52,847
Looks like a virgin.

68
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,987
I'm not staying here.

69
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:04,002
As you please, but you will
not find more comfortable...

70
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,102
...layer.

71
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,327
I'm leaving right away.

72
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,952
Why, my dear?
Here, you can...

73
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:14,677
...to remain a virgin forever.

74
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,293
For men, at least.

75
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,792
I,
I was a virgin every night.

76
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,847
Return.
- Let her go.

77
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,657
I agree,
it has no place here.

78
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:51,336
A soup,
that's all I ask.

79
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:55,574
soup for a poor blind.

80
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,827
Come, my pretty, I'll do your education.

81
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,732
Let her. You see it's not a lady?

82
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,827
Where are you, my child?

83
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:08,627
I have to find shelter for the night.

84
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,787
You have money?

85
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:12,787
Hundred crowns, Father.
This is all my fortune.

86
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,947
So we must take care.
Where are they?

87
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,047
Here, Father.

88
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,895
I'll keep it for you.

89
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:25,147
Monsieur du Harpin
goes to church every morning.

90
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:28,347
Come with him and I give
them to you tomorrow.

91
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,847
It houses nearby,
his house is very nice.

92
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,107
A house, Father?

93
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:34,907
In any virtue.

94
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:37,707
Go, my child,
is the end of the street.

95
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,807
Thank you Father.

96
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,447
God bless you.

97
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,207
Your attention, ladies.

98
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,787
Hurry. Claudine,
teach him the ropes.

99
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,967
Come on, baby.

100
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,207
Ladies.

101
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:37,707
Who goes there?

102
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,807
Monsieur du Harpin?

103
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,227
I was told that you could accommodate me.

104
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,067
You can pay?

105
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,947
Yes, sir.

106
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:50,209
All right, then enter.

107
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,847
Come, come.

108
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,207
It will make you...

109
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:08,137
A crown for the night. That you...

110
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:13,907
Where is the money?

111
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,707
In an abbot in safety.

112
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,347
I will make it to church tomorrow.

113
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:20,147
What Father?

114
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:22,727
He said you go every morning.

115
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,693
Poor little fool.

116
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:27,827
You lie.

117
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,927
No, I swear no.

118
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,812
But, finally... you do not have an agent.

119
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,822
Looks like I have no money,

120
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,769
no friends and no roof.
- Listen.

121
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:49,728
I have no servant,
then maybe we can.

122
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,087
Finding a.

123
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:55,987
I will be working.

124
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,087
It's not all.

125
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,374
You eat a lot?
- No.

126
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,847
Bread and soup.

127
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,287
Soup.

128
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,487
I,

129
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,449
I eat once a week.

130
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,167
This is bread and water.

131
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,327
That's all.

132
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,627
I do not care,
long as I have a roof.

133
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:30,256
You will sleep in another room.

134
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:32,607
Come.

135
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:38,378
Well, that's pretty, right?

136
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,447
You like?

137
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,690
This dress is far too beautiful...

138
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,167
...for a servant.

139
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:07,607
Active up.

140
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,967
But...

141
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:12,607
I will take...

142
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,694
Great care for you.

143
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,087
Hurry.

144
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,497
Do not be shy, do see the rest.

145
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,407
Turn around.

146
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,207
Exquisite.

147
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,087
Magnificent...

148
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,807
...this stuff.

149
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:19,047
It'll search...

150
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,767
...3 in the ECU.

151
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,614
Men can be insatiable.

152
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,812
Do you know satisfy them?

153
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,847
I will try.

154
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:56,296
Do not forget.
At six o'clock tomorrow morning,

155
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,807
home do it to be perfect,

156
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:03,613
tured and stairs.

157
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:09,962
Know that in this house,
there are other people.

158
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,207
People vain.

159
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,507
Is it true that prosperity...

160
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:15,092
...may accompany the more bad behavior...

161
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,332
...while the misfortune...

162
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:21,138
...tirelessly heels virtue?

163
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,973
How many torments Justine
should it endure?

164
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:12,547
His innocence-even prevented
him from understanding...

165
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,452
...infamy quijalonnaient his way.

166
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:48,327
Be careful, of course.

167
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,397
I'm sorry.

168
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:51,987
But who are you?

169
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,087
The good news, sir.

170
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,867
And what's your name, little turkey?

171
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,967
Justine, sir.

172
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:09,328
Mr. Desroches,
I rent the first floor.

173
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:15,827
He do it to be cleaned every day, including
?

174
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:19,648
Sometimes at night,
clean it again.

175
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:20,507
Yes, sir.

176
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:24,089
In this case, I'll call you.

177
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,167
Yes, sir.

178
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,992
I want to go here and here and there.

179
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:46,333
All around the world.

180
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,447
My dear child...

181
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,371
I want to go here and there...

182
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:30,614
Approach.
- Yes, sir?

183
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,847
Come.

184
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:38,727
Tell me...

185
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,407
Do you like it?

186
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,107
I find beautiful.

187
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:46,654
I spoke with Mr.
of Harpin.

188
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:49,907
In your subject.

189
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:53,582
We agreed that in future it
would be more convenient...

190
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,682
...

191
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:04,732
You to sleep on the floor.

192
00:24:06,687 --> 00:24:08,427
But you sleep.

193
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:10,527
Exactly.

194
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,890
This pretty bauble will be yours.

195
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:38,547
But not right away.

196
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:41,810
In two or three months, say.

197
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:44,818
Not here, not here...

198
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:48,047
But here.

199
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,533
Little Demon.
- Get off me.

200
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,567
Come back.

201
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,247
What has happened?

202
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:16,175
He wanted me to sleep with him.

203
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,887
And why not?

204
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,568
Poor woodcock.

205
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:25,367
This is exactly my plan.

206
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:29,370
Up there, there is a box...

207
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:31,847
...filled jewelry.

208
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,867
Here is my plan.

209
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:38,256
At night, when he is asleep, you can...

210
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,687
...you take it.

211
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,507
Little bitch.

212
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,607
Species of...

213
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:56,087
Poor fool.

214
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:03,627
For sale. Pretty dress.
In perfect condition.

215
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:04,787
Lovely, no?

216
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:07,208
How?
- ECU 3 and a half.

217
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,807
How do you offer me?

218
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:12,747
Come and buy this beautiful dress.

219
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:14,907
Guaranteed in perfect condition.

220
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,347
A real bargain for your lady.

221
00:26:17,447 --> 00:26:21,347
You will not find better,
is the bargain of the century.

222
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,427
5 No, not four, but three miserable
crowns and a half.

223
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:26,667
A stunning dress in perfect condition.

224
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:30,422
A case unexpected.
The chance of a lifetime.

225
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:34,847
This is the house.

226
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,487
And here's the girl.

227
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:47,847
Come here, you.

228
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:00,649
Mr. Desroches.

229
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:05,576
What brings you here so early?

230
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:09,370
Well, when I got home,
this morning,

231
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:12,427
I opened my tape and I discovered...

232
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:15,531
...a gold brooch had disappeared.

233
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:17,787
How?

234
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:22,017
Do not hold me still not responsible?

235
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,178
Not you, sir. But.

236
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:30,467
Yesterday
after drinking the wine you have served me,

237
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,827
I slept more deeply than usual.

238
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:35,533
I had to sleep like a log.

239
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,812
When she cleaned my room.

240
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:44,027
This is the only one that could have
steal my pin.

241
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,127
I did not fly.

242
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:49,448
See for yourself, sir,

243
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,169
everything she has...

244
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:56,137
...is on his back...

245
00:27:56,567 --> 00:28:00,458
...and in this room...

246
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:04,248
...which serves as bedroom.

247
00:28:04,407 --> 00:28:06,407
Dig it.

248
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,454
Not there.
- Or hidden.

249
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,609
I arrest you for theft.

250
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:32,928
The sentence incurred is death.

251
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,667
I did not fly.

252
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,767
Take her.

253
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:53,207
Sad end to a life of debauchery.

254
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,769
And I'll have to find...

255
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,767
Another good.

256
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,787
Hey, you.

257
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,887
This way.

258
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,247
Welcome, treasure.

259
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,187
The pittance is sad but not the company.

260
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,497
You planning to stay long?

261
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,607
I do not know.

262
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,130
Explain to me what brings you here.

263
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:38,812
You breathe innocence.
- But I'm innocent.

264
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:41,472
I have been accused unjustly.

265
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:43,767
I know, my dear.

266
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,931
A we hear, we are all innocent.

267
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,011
Finally, all except her.

268
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:56,212
Who is she?
- It is called Dubois.

269
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,327
Cite me a crime.

270
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,767
Any,

271
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,467
she has committed.

272
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:04,987
Vol.

273
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:07,087
With violence.

274
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,489
Hijacking children.

275
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:14,207
Murder.

276
00:30:16,287 --> 00:30:18,582
Prouvé half a dozen times.

277
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:22,267
Without proof, a good dozen.

278
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:26,512
It will be hanged high and short
tomorrow morning.

279
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:30,648
They are building the scaffold.

280
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,467
There will host tomorrow to see pass away.

281
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,567
Thousands.

282
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,962
This is what I want for myself.

283
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,637
Come,
this is the last night of Dubois.

284
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,447
Celebrate.

285
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:00,892
Go, Dubois,
opens the festivities.

286
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,734
What do you want?

287
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:58,767
I do not want you there.

288
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:04,138
I need you, your help.

289
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:08,975
But how?
They say that tomorrow you...

290
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,289
Tomorrow, nothing.

291
00:34:16,207 --> 00:34:20,451
I will leave this place.
Tonight.

292
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,367
And you too.

293
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:29,934
Four men building the scaffold...

294
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:32,212
...which is meant for me.

295
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:35,367
These are my friends.

296
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:39,772
They have planned for me
a more pleasing output.

297
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:45,452
What do you expect of me?

298
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,607
Before nightfall,

299
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:53,327
they will light the torches in the yard.

300
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:57,507
It will take you to scream,
with all your might, right?

301
00:34:57,607 --> 00:35:00,690
This will create confusion,

302
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:04,376
they'll throw a rope over Wall...

303
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,657
...hello and company.

304
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,967
You and I heard?

305
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,727
Why me?

306
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,927
Because...

307
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,088
You seem so innocent.

308
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,047
Little Thief.

309
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:42,130
You can get off, that's fine.
Rest.

310
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,677
You know the story of two small birds?

311
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:06,127
It's a bird that says to another: 'idiot' and...

312
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,967
You ready?

313
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,047
Silence.

314
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,887
Help. With the help.

315
00:36:58,977 --> 00:37:01,811
Fire. It's raining fire.

316
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:10,087
With the help.

317
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:40,651
Help. We're all gonna burn.

318
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,467
Who is it?
- Come on, let's.

319
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:03,567
It's coming with us.

320
00:38:03,887 --> 00:38:06,507
Go rot in hell.
She's coming with us.

321
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:08,787
What are you waiting?
- Veins.

322
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,652
Come Dubois, follow us.

323
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,127
Meanwhile,

324
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,267
Juliet took advantage of their learning.

325
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,707
She felt that, for the crime born,

326
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:31,612
at least she would go to great...

327
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:35,757
...and refused any limits
to his debaucheries.

328
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,782
This is the same young man.

329
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,809
Why is he with her?

330
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,127
I had a preference.

331
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,568
When he could pay, my dear.

332
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,447
The bitch.

333
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:12,814
Say it uses our money.

334
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:31,093
Remember,
virtue leads only to disaster.

335
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:34,467
Just as poverty,
which should be prohibited.

336
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:37,810
How do if you are young and impatient?

337
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,707
But the crime, see.

338
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,782
The worse the better,
duly rewarded.

339
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:58,727
Do as I say.

340
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:43,227
Soldiers await you at the gates of the city.

341
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:47,187
What other news from Paris?

342
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:51,027
The prison was burned, condemned
20 perished.

343
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,369
You only have survived.

344
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,087
It's awful.

345
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:57,907
What is awful?

346
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:01,090
Whether dead or that you're alive?

347
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,927
Other instructions?

348
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:09,447
What do you want?

349
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:14,607
What I serve you on a platter...

350
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,167
...as a delicacy?

351
00:46:23,087 --> 00:46:25,892
Yesterday, they've saved my life.

352
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:28,997
Expresses them your gratitude.

353
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,007
I'm going.

354
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:44,047
Wait.

355
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:51,009
We'll give him the choice.

356
00:46:55,527 --> 00:46:57,527
So, my pretty...

357
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,547
Here, before you...

358
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:03,197
...four beautiful stallions...

359
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,447
...all eager...

360
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:10,815
...to get your favors.

361
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,729
The choice is yours.

362
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,567
What are we waiting?

363
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:35,127
Enough.

364
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,527
Back.

365
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:52,653
Why saving me,
if that was why?

366
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:57,087
How, why?

367
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:03,570
I know thousands of women in Paris...

368
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:07,892
...who would give everything
to be in your shoes.

369
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,288
Beautiful big boys.

370
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,567
Well.

371
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:19,607
I give you the choice.

372
00:48:21,887 --> 00:48:25,334
You'll join us,
you become one of us,

373
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:28,947
you fly with us,
you fight with us...

374
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:33,717
...you live with us and, if necessary,
you die with us.

375
00:48:37,607 --> 00:48:39,607
Here.

376
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:43,007
It is our company.

377
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:45,807
I will get the,

378
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:48,327
I settled there.

379
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:51,027
Do him the point violence.

380
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:53,971
And hold you in awe.

381
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:57,692
See for yourself as innocent...

382
00:48:58,047 --> 00:49:00,095
...can be helpful.

383
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:05,632
Let us use in,
do not sacrifice our pleasures.

384
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:08,852
It's better for business.

385
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:14,307
It's one of us.
- Did you hear the Dubois.

386
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:17,552
If it's ours,
what are we waiting for?

387
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,245
And why you would be the first?

388
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:29,567
And you, then?

389
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:01,647
Enough.

390
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:03,927
Stop.

391
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:13,447
You stay there.

392
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:17,687
I will massacre you.

393
00:51:28,327 --> 00:51:30,327
Do not be afraid.

394
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,687
How do you feel?

395
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:54,467
Do not touch me.

396
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:56,567
What do you fear?

397
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,207
I will do you no harm.

398
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:05,247
Where am I?

399
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:06,947
Who are you?

400
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:10,107
My name is Raymond.
I am passionate about painting.

401
00:53:10,207 --> 00:53:11,907
You are at home here.

402
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:12,787
I live alone.

403
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:15,352
I've been here long?
- 5 days.

404
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:19,087
Until yesterday,
I was worried about you.

405
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:23,387
Do not know anything about me.

406
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:25,487
What is your name?

407
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:27,687
Justine.

408
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:29,847
It is enough for me.

409
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:33,607
Do not worry.

410
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:38,307
You made me afraid.
I am going away.

411
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:40,407
Stop, please.

412
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:45,450
I have no money.
I can not pay you.

413
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,527
But if.

414
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:51,127
You can ask for me.

415
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,247
Do not move.

416
00:54:26,207 --> 00:54:28,417
Raymond, dinner is served.

417
00:54:48,647 --> 00:54:50,647
You like?

418
00:54:51,327 --> 00:54:53,327
Yes, I like.

419
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,089
You wanted me to paint.

420
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:44,977
Of course I want to paint.

421
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:50,967
But as you know.

422
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,807
You love.

423
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,729
I mean you no harm.

424
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:01,694
You had to suffer so much.

425
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:04,767
You do not mention it...

426
00:56:04,857 --> 00:56:07,067
...but I see in your eyes.

427
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:10,855
I want to love you truly.

428
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:14,727
Tenderly.

429
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:23,091
You have nothing to fear,
now.

430
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:12,847
I gotta go.
- Why?

431
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:15,248
It must be.
- Justine.

432
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:22,747
Excuse me, sir.
- What do you want?

433
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:25,347
Two convicted have escaped 8 days ago.

434
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:28,252
Condemned?
- For theft and murder.

435
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,267
What can I do?
They are not here.

436
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,512
They could be without your knowledge.

437
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:34,987
Do not enter.

438
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:37,087
Who goes there?

439
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,087
Who's there?
This is one of them.

440
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:45,576
Go away.
- Help.

441
00:57:52,447 --> 00:57:54,447
Catch it.

442
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:31,292
I'll get you, Jasmine,
you can not escape.

443
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:35,267
I told you that I'll get you.

444
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:37,367
Wait a minute.

445
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,927
Who goes there?

446
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:03,867
My pretty. Who are you
and what do you house?

447
00:59:04,687 --> 00:59:06,387
You watched us?

448
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:08,487
Let me go.

449
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,147
I have done nothing wrong.
- Do not lie.

450
00:59:14,247 --> 00:59:16,614
You watched us.
- No.

451
00:59:22,047 --> 00:59:24,047
Jasmin, come and see...

452
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,327
...that's the spy.

453
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:56,568
You have been convicted and sentenced.

454
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:59,847
And here's the verdict.

455
01:00:00,407 --> 01:00:02,407
I do not understand.

456
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:05,987
I am the Chevalier de Bressac.
These woods belong to me.

457
01:00:06,087 --> 01:00:09,232
I would have killed you for poaching.

458
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,922
But I decided to spare the lives you...

459
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,672
...because you could help me.

460
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:20,207
You are young...

461
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:25,302
...and you have a certain air of innocence.

462
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:26,827
To see your bet,

463
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:30,932
you're running someone or something.
Maybe both.

464
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:36,847
Good.

465
01:00:38,047 --> 01:00:40,172
If you can earn my trust,

466
01:00:42,327 --> 01:00:45,490
I can offer you a roof...

467
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,167
...and employment.

468
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,167
Hello, ma'am.

469
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:51,687
Me.

470
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,407
You know, my dear...

471
01:02:03,477 --> 01:02:06,367
...you're there for only 3 months.

472
01:02:06,607 --> 01:02:09,072
And I can not do without you.

473
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,567
Thank you, Madame.

474
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:14,887
This week in Paris...

475
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:18,197
...you got me terribly missed.

476
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:22,448
Why do you refuse to come?

477
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:25,167
I'm sorry, ma'am.

478
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:32,367
Come, Justine.

479
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:34,797
You'll help me take my bath.

480
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:50,997
My husband did not tell you
molested during my absence?

481
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:56,867
He did not try anything more?
- No, ma'am.

482
01:02:56,967 --> 01:02:58,967
Course.

483
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:14,027
You have to trust me with all your secrets.

484
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:15,787
Remember,

485
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:18,049
we all share.

486
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:25,567
Any.

487
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:16,167
What do you want?

488
01:04:17,247 --> 01:04:20,854
Not you, my dear.
Simply a favor.

489
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:23,467
Your wife will hear.

490
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,567
It is next.
- I know.

491
01:04:25,967 --> 01:04:31,067
It is this proximity that makes
you so valuable to my plans.

492
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:34,369
But why?

493
01:04:35,047 --> 01:04:37,342
You do not know it perhaps,

494
01:04:37,727 --> 01:04:41,187
But the whole fortune of the family,
all this,

495
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:45,027
houses of Paris, mine,
in a word, everything.

496
01:04:45,087 --> 01:04:46,747
Everything belongs to my wife.

497
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,482
I only have 5000 crowns a year,

498
01:04:49,687 --> 01:04:52,293
until the death of my wife.

499
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:00,887
Every morning at sunrise,

500
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:03,107
thou bringest him...

501
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:05,027
...a cup of chocolate.

502
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:09,887
This is the work of a moment
to decorate this beverage...

503
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,097
...a pinch of this powder.

504
01:05:12,607 --> 01:05:15,133
Remember that I have saved.

505
01:05:17,807 --> 01:05:19,807
I ask little in return.

506
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:23,547
Dreams about it.

507
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,187
This is your wife.

508
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:27,107
It takes courage.

509
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:29,207
What if I refuse?

510
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:33,167
I will tell him that you are
planning to assassinate...

511
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:34,267
.

512
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:36,367
Good night.

513
01:05:42,367 --> 01:05:44,367
Do sweet dreams.

514
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:12,527
Tell me, mirror...

515
01:06:13,047 --> 01:06:15,971
Who can be prettier than me?

516
01:06:19,487 --> 01:06:21,487
Hello, Justine.

517
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:23,787
Hello, ma'am.

518
01:06:23,887 --> 01:06:25,935
Verse me my chocolate.

519
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,367
What's going on?

520
01:06:39,087 --> 01:06:41,087
Madame...

521
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,177
What has he?

522
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,307
This is your husband.

523
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:48,407
My husband?

524
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,207
What has he done?

525
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:00,175
It asks me for help...

526
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:03,727
...to assassinate you.

527
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:08,127
This is a joke.

528
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:10,647
It makes you walk.

529
01:07:11,087 --> 01:07:14,827
He gave me this,
to pour into your chocolate.

530
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:18,137
This is ridiculous.
Give me that. Look.

531
01:07:22,927 --> 01:07:24,927
Cyril.

532
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:36,969
See how he likes.

533
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:14,447
I was expecting you.

534
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:18,167
Really?

535
01:08:20,127 --> 01:08:23,507
Every afternoon,
I allow myself to dream that one day...

536
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,292
...any of us will be as before.

537
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:31,136
I take a bath, I lay...

538
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,967
...and waiting for you.

539
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:37,207
Poor Emily.

540
01:08:38,567 --> 01:08:42,856
I know why,
you looking for other pleasures.

541
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:45,007
But now.

542
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,167
I'm here.

543
01:08:49,927 --> 01:08:51,927
And I want you.

544
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:37,177
Your favorite wine, and mine.

545
01:09:39,767 --> 01:09:42,088
As in the early days.

546
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:47,312
And if everything changed that night?

547
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:21,507
My friend,

548
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:23,769
you are passionate again.

549
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:29,867
Because
excitement has never been more intense.

550
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:31,967
Why?

551
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:35,467
I find it exciting to make love...

552
01:11:35,567 --> 01:11:38,650
...someone about to die.

553
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:42,372
What do you mean by that?

554
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,453
Death awaits you, my dear.

555
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:48,613
Your cheeks already pale.

556
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:52,167
Your eyes...

557
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:58,413
You have drunk my wine.
My favorite wine.

558
01:12:29,487 --> 01:12:31,728
Bitch. Traitor. Criminal.

559
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:34,367
Oh, yes.

560
01:12:34,847 --> 01:12:37,667
The wine that my wife drank was poisoned,

561
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:40,168
she died in agony...

562
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:42,027
...pronouncing your name.

563
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:44,127
You killed her.

564
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,927
Who will believe you?

565
01:12:57,647 --> 01:13:02,832
Who will believe you
with the seal of the murder on his chest?

566
01:13:31,687 --> 01:13:33,687
Detach the.

567
01:13:53,087 --> 01:13:54,907
Do not forget,

568
01:13:55,007 --> 01:13:58,152
any police France is looking for you.

569
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:00,407
Hide yourself...

570
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:02,927
If you can.

571
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:09,647
Get up.

572
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:11,974
Come on, clear off.

573
01:14:16,647 --> 01:14:18,647
Come.

574
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:00,567
Poor Justine...

575
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:05,787
...destined by Providence to
fall into the hands of cruel...

576
01:15:05,887 --> 01:15:07,889
...and to be the prey.

577
01:15:09,887 --> 01:15:13,050
Nature does not leave our hands...

578
01:15:13,207 --> 01:15:15,502
...free to commit crimes...

579
01:15:15,585 --> 01:15:17,867
...which would defeat its needs.

580
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:20,772
The balance be preserved do it...

581
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,930
...and it can not be by crime.

582
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,467
Further claims in words,

583
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:30,367
crime serves Nature.

584
01:15:39,407 --> 01:15:43,190
And in this same forest
# where Justine fled,

585
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,787
sister Juliette was about to collect...

586
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:50,097
...fruits of his vice of choice.

587
01:15:54,727 --> 01:15:56,467
Sweet Juliette,
recent days...

588
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:59,947
...our crimes
allowed us to amass a tidy fortune.

589
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:03,872
Do not you think also that vice is a delight?

590
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,547
Besides profit drawn from it.

591
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:07,647
I am sure.

592
01:16:08,007 --> 01:16:09,667
You've learned well.

593
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:12,402
I could not dream best student.

594
01:16:18,087 --> 01:16:20,087
How about a bath?

595
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:23,127
We are alone.

596
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:26,367
Charming idea.

597
01:16:32,207 --> 01:16:34,207
Give me your hand.

598
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,967
Come where it is deeper.

599
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:53,027
A pretty fortune thanks to you,

600
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:55,127
I do not want to share.

601
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:13,227
You've taken everything in the house?

602
01:18:13,327 --> 01:18:15,327
Any. And Claudine?

603
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,567
She left us.

604
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,127
Forever.

605
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:51,607
Hello.
- Hello, Miss.

606
01:18:51,967 --> 01:18:53,967
Can you tell me...

607
01:18:54,127 --> 01:18:57,256
...if it is a church you see there?

608
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:58,347
No, Mademoiselle.

609
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:00,447
It was a monastery.

610
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:02,767
Devois Castle.

611
01:19:03,647 --> 01:19:05,647
Is it inhabited?

612
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,827
4 By pious men who say...

613
01:19:07,927 --> 01:19:10,787
...have abandoned all their worldly goods...

614
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:13,012
...to spend their days...

615
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,375
...to study and meditation.

616
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:19,347
Do you think they would welcome me?

617
01:19:19,447 --> 01:19:23,102
These four men under
never leave the castle.

618
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:26,137
But you can talk to the guard.

619
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:29,927
Thank you.

620
01:20:24,847 --> 01:20:26,847
What do you want?

621
01:20:29,127 --> 01:20:31,129
Asylum, sir.

622
01:20:32,927 --> 01:20:34,927
Are you alone?

623
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,862
I have nobody in the world.

624
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:46,609
I implore you,

625
01:20:47,207 --> 01:20:51,212
behalf of men who live here,
let me stay.

626
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:53,767
Have mercy on me.

627
01:21:21,687 --> 01:21:23,687
Approach.

628
01:21:33,687 --> 01:21:35,187
Your name?

629
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:37,287
Justine.

630
01:21:41,967 --> 01:21:43,967
What brings you here?

631
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:46,087
Sir,

632
01:21:46,157 --> 01:21:49,307
I suffered all the cruelties,
I was stripped,

633
01:21:49,407 --> 01:21:52,092
Falsely accused, imprisoned,

634
01:21:52,247 --> 01:21:55,410
assaulted, beaten and chased.

635
01:21:57,207 --> 01:21:59,653
I lost everything.
- All?

636
01:22:00,327 --> 01:22:02,327
Do not be shy, answer.

637
01:22:04,407 --> 01:22:07,616
Are you still a girl of virtue?

638
01:22:16,127 --> 01:22:18,127
In this case,

639
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:20,227
'm welcome.

640
01:22:20,327 --> 01:22:22,489
Devois the castle.

641
01:22:24,327 --> 01:22:26,327
My name is Clement.

642
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:30,210
Emmanuel,
I entrust this young woman.

643
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,847
Gives him new clothes,

644
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:36,614
and it refresh the body and mind.

645
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:40,587
You'll join us for dinner tonight...

646
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:45,177
...and you will meet of our guests,

647
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:47,767
and our master,

648
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:50,367
founding of our fraternity.

649
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:55,735
Thank you for your kindness.

650
01:22:57,287 --> 01:23:00,857
Can I ask the name of one I have to thank?

651
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:07,607
His name.

652
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:10,574
Brother Antoninus.

653
01:23:39,007 --> 01:23:41,007
We have a guest?

654
01:23:41,127 --> 01:23:43,252
She expected to be cited.

655
01:24:29,207 --> 01:24:31,207
Here is Justine?

656
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:35,528
Approach, my child.

657
01:24:36,727 --> 01:24:38,727
Come near me.

658
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:06,752
Let me introduce your new companions.

659
01:25:09,727 --> 01:25:11,147
Olivia.

660
01:25:11,247 --> 01:25:13,247
Emilia.

661
01:25:13,527 --> 01:25:15,527
Cordelia.

662
01:25:17,047 --> 01:25:19,047
Florette.

663
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:28,132
As the other members of our brotherhood
: Raphael.

664
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:31,527
Manual,

665
01:25:32,847 --> 01:25:34,847
Ezekiel...

666
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:38,367
...and Clement.

667
01:25:42,607 --> 01:25:44,607
My Friends.

668
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,867
We were waiting for a new recruit...

669
01:25:51,967 --> 01:25:55,282
...and Providence sent us this young...

670
01:25:55,927 --> 01:25:57,927
...and desirable...

671
01:26:00,607 --> 01:26:02,607
...fruit.

672
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:06,374
Your companions arrived here like you.

673
01:26:06,687 --> 01:26:08,812
Only and without friends.

674
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,667
It is only an occupation:

675
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:16,567
We serve as we please.

676
01:26:16,807 --> 01:26:18,809
Get ready to join them.

677
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:23,007
Type it.

678
01:26:27,887 --> 01:26:30,352
I was told you were good men.

679
01:26:30,407 --> 01:26:32,987
And that you are dedicated to meditation...

680
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,467
...and study.

681
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:36,267
Right.

682
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:39,852
And the object of our study is another...

683
01:26:41,687 --> 01:26:44,492
...that the conquest of pleasure.

684
01:26:48,687 --> 01:26:50,547
With the help.

685
01:26:50,647 --> 01:26:53,014
The supreme pleasure.

686
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:04,973
Our cruelty terrified you?
Why?

687
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:10,587
A pleasure shared is not...

688
01:27:10,687 --> 01:27:13,167
...necessarily more pleasure.

689
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:15,107
Better,

690
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:19,178
we are concerned that our own pleasure.

691
01:27:22,647 --> 01:27:25,253
He only flatters our ego.

692
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:32,427
And the more we satisfy our ego and
our inclinations,

693
01:27:32,527 --> 01:27:36,896
more they ask to be.

694
01:31:00,527 --> 01:31:02,907
Thus our search is progressing.

695
01:31:03,007 --> 01:31:05,007
Again and again...

696
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:11,887
Perhaps...

697
01:31:14,767 --> 01:31:16,769
Perhaps it is endless.

698
01:31:17,287 --> 01:31:19,582
No matter, we are pursuing.

699
01:31:27,447 --> 01:31:29,654
For what?
We do not know.

700
01:31:50,767 --> 01:31:54,089
For what?
We do not know.

701
01:32:23,727 --> 01:32:25,727
How long have I slept?

702
01:32:27,327 --> 01:32:29,327
Two days.

703
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:31,967
Time does not matter.

704
01:32:41,207 --> 01:32:43,207
How long are you here?

705
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:47,007
I took her there...

706
01:32:47,727 --> 01:32:49,727
...there one year.

707
01:32:56,527 --> 01:33:00,009
He do it well be a way to escape.

708
01:33:00,887 --> 01:33:02,887
This is obvious.

709
01:33:03,087 --> 01:33:05,087
Occasionally,

710
01:33:05,607 --> 01:33:07,607
girls go...

711
01:33:09,647 --> 01:33:11,647
...and more are coming.

712
01:33:13,807 --> 01:33:15,807
How do they leave?

713
01:33:16,327 --> 01:33:19,297
Suddenly and without a trace.

714
01:33:21,487 --> 01:33:23,489
It has never new.

715
01:33:26,447 --> 01:33:28,912
Maybe they are just returned.

716
01:33:29,847 --> 01:33:31,707
After what they saw,

717
01:33:31,807 --> 01:33:35,037
do you think the monks they be spared?

718
01:33:36,047 --> 01:33:38,047
I want to die.

719
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:41,047
Do not lose hope.

720
01:33:44,567 --> 01:33:46,567
What time is it?

721
01:33:47,887 --> 01:33:49,887
It's getting late.

722
01:33:50,887 --> 01:33:52,887
The day will soon rise.

723
01:34:56,087 --> 01:34:59,375
I made you call, Justine...

724
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:02,777
...because I see in you...

725
01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:06,051
...signs of a true faith.

726
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:09,287
I believe.

727
01:35:09,527 --> 01:35:11,227
I am right...

728
01:35:11,327 --> 01:35:15,067
...and you are wrong.
If you hear it as well.

729
01:35:18,767 --> 01:35:20,767
Behold, my dear,

730
01:35:21,167 --> 01:35:24,296
where the path of virtue led you.

731
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:29,927
The agonies you have endured,
suffering you have endured.

732
01:35:31,367 --> 01:35:34,257
If these are the fruits of virtue,

733
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,647
do not you think...

734
01:35:39,087 --> 01:35:41,488
...they represent for you...

735
01:35:42,807 --> 01:35:44,807
...ultimate enjoyment?

736
01:35:48,007 --> 01:35:50,007
I do not understand.

737
01:35:51,007 --> 01:35:53,007
Really?

738
01:35:55,127 --> 01:35:58,017
Is it not possible that for you...

739
01:35:58,102 --> 01:36:00,102
...enjoyment Supreme...

740
01:36:02,607 --> 01:36:04,607
...lies in suffering?

741
01:36:07,087 --> 01:36:09,087
But,

742
01:36:09,407 --> 01:36:12,217
if what you say is correct,

743
01:36:14,007 --> 01:36:16,007
so I am the sinner,

744
01:36:16,767 --> 01:36:19,062
and you, the man of virtue?

745
01:36:23,927 --> 01:36:25,927
Finally.

746
01:36:33,847 --> 01:36:35,929
Do you understand.

747
01:37:10,327 --> 01:37:12,327
Companions.

748
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:18,387
Tonight we celebrate the anniversary of our
brotherhood.

749
01:37:18,487 --> 01:37:21,632
Brother Antoninus. Brother Antoninus.

750
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:25,688
One of us has managed like wildfire,

751
01:37:27,327 --> 01:37:30,557
achieve the essence of our philosophy.

752
01:37:33,607 --> 01:37:35,607
Justine.

753
01:37:36,887 --> 01:37:38,887
Exactly.

754
01:37:39,487 --> 01:37:43,737
This is why I decided to shorten his stay
among us.

755
01:37:45,007 --> 01:37:47,007
Tonight...

756
01:37:48,767 --> 01:37:50,767
...she leaves...

757
01:37:51,447 --> 01:37:53,447
...forever.

758
01:37:57,167 --> 01:37:59,295
But, Brother Antoninus...

759
01:38:01,687 --> 01:38:03,687
This is my will.

760
01:39:52,567 --> 01:39:54,569
Brother Antoninus.

761
01:39:56,127 --> 01:39:58,127
Justine.

762
01:40:02,607 --> 01:40:04,667
It is now up to you to know...

763
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:08,307
...the ultimate sacrifice for our search...

764
01:40:08,407 --> 01:40:10,853
...fun.

765
01:41:25,567 --> 01:41:27,567
Come
- No.

766
01:41:46,687 --> 01:41:50,682
Justine, where are you?
- You will not find her.

767
01:42:38,127 --> 01:42:41,527
What is it, check?
- A woman on the road.

768
01:43:59,887 --> 01:44:03,050
Wonders that come from Africa.

769
01:44:03,207 --> 01:44:04,707
They dance, wiggle...

770
01:44:04,807 --> 01:44:07,811
Gentlemen,
you leave your wives.

771
01:44:07,967 --> 01:44:08,787
And Ladies.

772
01:44:08,887 --> 01:44:12,369
You will discover things never seen...

773
01:44:15,767 --> 01:44:17,815
You'll see...

774
01:44:26,527 --> 01:44:29,417
Quiet, please.
Calm, my friends.

775
01:44:29,567 --> 01:44:32,969
The show will begin.
Please be seated.

776
01:44:33,887 --> 01:44:35,587
Innkeeper.

777
01:44:35,687 --> 01:44:38,213
Sir?
- A room for the lady.

778
01:44:39,247 --> 01:44:41,667
It's market day, I am complete.

779
01:44:41,767 --> 01:44:44,338
See what state she is.

780
01:44:44,927 --> 01:44:47,214
He has my parlor.
- Go.

781
01:44:47,647 --> 01:44:49,647
Yes, sir.

782
01:45:04,567 --> 01:45:06,567
Excuse me, sir.

783
01:45:07,007 --> 01:45:09,007
Apologies.

784
01:45:09,407 --> 01:45:11,407
I have friends in town.

785
01:45:13,087 --> 01:45:15,613
I will return soon.

786
01:45:17,687 --> 01:45:19,687
Raymond...

787
01:45:27,607 --> 01:45:29,607
I love you.

788
01:46:37,887 --> 01:46:39,887
Hello.

789
01:46:40,527 --> 01:46:44,012
A friend of mine came
with a young woman.

790
01:46:44,327 --> 01:46:46,327
He asked me...

791
01:46:46,527 --> 01:46:48,527
...take care of it.

792
01:46:49,807 --> 01:46:53,887
You made quickly.
It is in the parlor. Follow me.

793
01:47:01,367 --> 01:47:03,227
My dear.

794
01:47:03,327 --> 01:47:06,536
What a joy to see you.

795
01:47:08,727 --> 01:47:11,936
That's all.
You can book, I took him.

796
01:47:12,327 --> 01:47:14,327
Well, ma'am.

797
01:47:15,207 --> 01:47:17,207
As we meet again.

798
01:47:17,327 --> 01:47:19,327
Let me go.

799
01:47:22,167 --> 01:47:24,747
You're not so innocent, finally,

800
01:47:24,847 --> 01:47:28,215
does not it?
Innocent little thief.

801
01:47:30,007 --> 01:47:33,648
You're coming with me.
Immediately.

802
01:47:34,887 --> 01:47:36,107
My God.

803
01:47:36,207 --> 01:47:38,813
Your God? What God?

804
01:47:40,047 --> 01:47:42,047
Evil exists on Earth.

805
01:47:42,727 --> 01:47:45,147
If God permits,
is that it is necessary...

806
01:47:45,247 --> 01:47:47,107
...or can not fight it.

807
01:47:47,207 --> 01:47:49,289
Your God to impress me.

808
01:47:50,767 --> 01:47:52,767
Come with me.

809
01:48:01,727 --> 01:48:04,362
Us once again our young friend.

810
01:48:04,487 --> 01:48:06,487
Hello, my dear.

811
01:48:34,727 --> 01:48:36,809
I would not say no.

812
01:48:54,087 --> 01:48:56,087
Come to your seats.

813
01:49:02,367 --> 01:49:04,367
You will do that later.

814
01:49:15,727 --> 01:49:17,727
Get up.

815
01:49:22,327 --> 01:49:25,472
You're so sick that you can not work?

816
01:49:26,367 --> 01:49:28,495
You're not a kid.

817
01:49:37,087 --> 01:49:40,062
Off your clothes like the others...

818
01:49:41,287 --> 01:49:43,287
...and climbs on it.

819
01:49:53,967 --> 01:49:55,307
How is she?

820
01:49:55,407 --> 01:49:58,411
But she's gone.
- Part?

821
01:49:59,047 --> 01:50:00,387
How so?

822
01:50:00,487 --> 01:50:02,569
Your friends took her.

823
01:50:02,727 --> 01:50:05,277
My Friends? But they are here.

824
01:50:05,372 --> 01:50:07,582
There had to be a mistake.

825
01:50:08,887 --> 01:50:11,128
I swear, it's a mistake.

826
01:50:25,287 --> 01:50:27,688
A long time ago,

827
01:50:28,127 --> 01:50:30,107
2 children were abducted by monkeys...

828
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,147
...and taken into the jungle.

829
01:50:32,247 --> 01:50:36,545
They joined a tribe living
on top of a waterfall...

830
01:50:36,645 --> 01:50:38,814
...that was so high...

831
01:50:39,687 --> 01:50:42,611
...that the sun never shone there.

832
01:50:43,327 --> 01:50:45,707
This is why they were white.

833
01:50:49,847 --> 01:50:52,054
And their awful...

834
01:50:53,127 --> 01:50:57,132
...descent, here,
Palamita.

835
01:50:58,047 --> 01:51:00,682
He was applauded.
I'll reveal...

836
01:51:08,607 --> 01:51:10,607
Silence.

837
01:51:12,087 --> 01:51:15,487
You have not seen it all, she will turn,

838
01:51:15,687 --> 01:51:18,237
to show you behind the scenes.

839
01:51:19,607 --> 01:51:23,687
And you will see that his
whiteness is spotless.

840
01:51:26,447 --> 01:51:29,849
Let, Palamita.
Unveils us your charms.

841
01:51:31,327 --> 01:51:33,327
Turn around, slut.

842
01:51:44,847 --> 01:51:46,847
This is a killer.

843
01:52:32,447 --> 01:52:34,447
Come here.
- Servant.

844
01:52:35,327 --> 01:52:38,297
What is it?
- We caught a criminal.

845
01:52:39,687 --> 01:52:42,736
Who was she killed? A commoner?

846
01:52:42,887 --> 01:52:46,287
No, Excellency, the Marquise de Bressac.

847
01:52:54,447 --> 01:52:56,447
What's going on?

848
01:52:59,127 --> 01:53:02,893
They arrested a criminal, a murderer.

849
01:53:19,807 --> 01:53:22,128
I refer to this woman.
Only.

850
01:53:22,807 --> 01:53:25,102
This is dangerous, my love.

851
01:53:25,487 --> 01:53:29,737
You are a minister of the King.
There is no danger.

852
01:53:31,927 --> 01:53:34,373
Stop. On behalf of the King.

853
01:53:35,367 --> 01:53:37,662
I am the Count of Corville.

854
01:53:40,207 --> 01:53:43,522
Release the girl,
I want to talk to him.

855
01:53:48,007 --> 01:53:50,007
Can you explain?

856
01:53:50,077 --> 01:53:52,209
This girl is my sister.

857
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:32,967
My poor child,

858
01:54:33,207 --> 01:54:36,387
everything you told me you predicted
arrived.

859
01:54:36,487 --> 01:54:39,218
While I unleashing my vice,

860
01:54:39,367 --> 01:54:42,172
I have experienced that pleasure.

861
01:54:42,447 --> 01:54:44,107
Up...

862
01:54:44,207 --> 01:54:48,053
Here I am mistress of an aristocrat wealthy.

863
01:54:48,767 --> 01:54:50,767
Minister of the King,

864
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:53,107
with my own home in Paris...

865
01:54:53,207 --> 01:54:55,672
...land across the country...

866
01:54:56,167 --> 01:54:58,932
...and two million ECU bank.

867
01:55:02,527 --> 01:55:06,612
My experience in this
world has taught me...

868
01:55:08,047 --> 01:55:10,087
...that only perverts...

869
01:55:11,327 --> 01:55:13,327
...prospered.

870
01:55:15,367 --> 01:55:17,367
And I intend,

871
01:55:18,287 --> 01:55:20,287
if fate lends me life,

872
01:55:22,207 --> 01:55:24,858
to change my behavior.

873
01:55:26,967 --> 01:55:28,967
No, my sister.

874
01:55:29,287 --> 01:55:32,687
If this is your conclusion,
you're wrong.

875
01:55:32,807 --> 01:55:35,612
My dissolute life proved sterile.

876
01:55:36,807 --> 01:55:40,727
You have known a thousand sufferings,
but you will be rewarded...

877
01:55:40,827 --> 01:55:41,827
.

878
01:55:41,927 --> 01:55:44,627
You'll stay with us in the country,

879
01:55:44,727 --> 01:55:47,787
where peace and happiness await you.

880
01:55:50,807 --> 01:55:52,807
The happiness?

881
01:55:57,327 --> 01:55:59,327
Poor child.

882
01:56:14,527 --> 01:56:17,098
For indeed, true happiness...

883
01:56:17,807 --> 01:56:21,129
...is found within quau of virtue.

884
01:56:21,967 --> 01:56:26,132
And if God allows it to
be persecuted on Earth...

885
01:56:26,367 --> 01:56:30,787
...this is compensated for by
most flattering rewards

886
01:56:32,087 --> 01:56:34,087
in heaven.
