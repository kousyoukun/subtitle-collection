1

先生，停车呀！

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,910
你叫什么名字？

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,230

意思就是你叫什么名字！
It means asking for your name.

8
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,870
外面有一个叫Shit的人叫我们停车！
There is a "Shit" man wanting us to stop.

9
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,910
这儿荒山野岭
But in such remote places,

10
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,870
又不知道他是什么人，怎么可以停车呢？
we should not stop for strangers.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,750
如果我们不停车的话，我想他会被渴死！
He may die of thirst if we don't stop for him.

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,780
亚七，叫停车
Seven, tell him to pull over at once.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,950
啊！
Yes.

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,030
师傅呀，我天天吃豆天天拉肚子
Master, I've been eating too many beans.and suffer diarrhoea from it.

15
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,870
再没有饭吃，我都快饿死了
If I don't have rice soon, I'll die too.

飞鸿，他哪里听得见呢？

18
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,390
喂…你干什么？
What are you doing?

19
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,990

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,030
停车，回头把那个人接上来！

21
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,710
这是什么话？

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,110

我从没见过这么疯的汉子！
Craziest damn thing I've ever seen.

24
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,880
有什么比救人一命更开心呢？
Nothing makes me happier than saving a life.

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,150
救自己一命罗！
How about saving yourself first?

26
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,390
小姐，实在无限感激

那边是我的家乡！

45
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,390
我和家人曾经迁往东部，但无法生活
My folks and I lived back east for a while..But things didn't work out.

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,510
所以前来寻找新生活

师傅，又是吃豆呀？

62
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,270
再吃下去，我看我很难见到阿苏！
We have to be very lucky.to make it to the America.

63
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,270
真想不到阿苏把宝芝林开到金山来了！
Ah Sol's clinic there is also.called Po Chi Lam right?

来，我请你喝一杯！
C'mon, let me buy you a drink.

149
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,710
心领了，林肯是不喝酒的
No, thanks Sheriff. Abraham Lincoln doesn't drink.

150
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,390
大惊小怪

151
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,510
镇上的啤酒不好喝呀！
The beer in town isn't good enough!

152
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,510
坐…坐下

155
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,190
等一会

156
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,590
他怎么了？
How's he doing?

157
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,070
宝芝林？那是什么意思？
Po Chi Lam? What's that mean?

158
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,060
做宣传嘛！

159
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,790
苏大夫，救命呀！

苏大夫，我们在金沙河救他们回来的

They've waken up for a short while,.then again lost consciousness.

165
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,940

不，不，不，我帮她揉…

172
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,070
别抢…别抢呀！抢什么抢？
Stop! What are you guys fighting for?

173
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,630
不要抢嘛，我们轮着做
Let's take turn.

174
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,110
我第一个！对对…
I'll be the first. Yes...

175
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,070
不…不行！她…
Wait! She is...

176
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,750
她是我师傅的未婚妻，怎能让你揉？
She is my master's fiancee,.don't you dare trying a finger on her.

177
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,790
如果你想打，吻我吧
If you want to kiss somebody, kiss me!

178
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,910
我并不是想吻她！
I ain't trying to kiss her.

179
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,910
你看这个洋鬼子，比我还要狠！
This white bastard actually wants more!

180
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,550
PLEASE…｜别吵！

181
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,350
她醒啦
She's awake now.

182
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,310

飞鸿！

186
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,870
诞下一名男婴哩
I have a new son!

187
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,510
编得好漂亮，我们要好好学习
This weave is excellent,.we should learn how to do it.

188

Father, the great spirit has.blessed me with another son.

189
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,750

190
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,830
停！
Stop!

191
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,830
你干么这样对待他？
Why do you treat him so badly?

192
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,150
他奇装异服的
His coat is different,

193

肤色与我们有别

195
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,500
但他流的血依然是红色的
His blood is red. Like us.

196
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,190
他岂会跟我们同一阵线？
But, it will not flow for us.

197
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,710
最后恐怕是我们会为他而流血
In the end I afraid we will be bleeding for him.

198
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,790
不
No!

199
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,980
走开
Go away.

200
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,160
你怎么可以对女子这么粗暴！
How can you be so rude to a lady?

201
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,940
你叫什么名字？…

你叫什么名字？

206
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,430
师傅，我天天吃豆我天天拉肚子
Master, I've been eating too many beans,

207
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,790
如果再没有饭吃，我也快将没命！
if I don't have rice soon, I'll die too.

208
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,870
小心！红蕃冲着我们来了！
Watch out! The Red Hair's coming.

209
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,110
对不起，对不起…

210
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:28,190
黄飞鸿…黄师傅…
Wong Fai-hong. Master Wong.

211
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,620
十三姨

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,750
十三姨，喝杯茶
Aunt Yee, would you like a cup of tea?

213
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,190

215
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,790
师傅的伞？
This is Master's umbrella!

216
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,030
十三姨，十三姨…
Aunt Yee...

217
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,390
看，是师傅的伞！
Look, this is Master's umbrella.

218
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,350
十三姨呀，我们吃完午餐再找吧！
Aunt Yee, shall we have lunch first?

219
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,030
我不饿，你们先吃吧！
I ain't hungry. You guys go ahead.

220
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,150
你们这些中国人到这里来干什么？
What are you Chinese doing here?

221
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,270
我们在找一位朋友，他在上游遇到意外
We are looking for a friend..He had an accident up river.

222
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,870
你该知道巴利镇长不喜欢…
Now you know Mayor Barclly...

223
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,390
看见中国人擅自离开应有范围
doesn't wanna see you Chinese outside your alley.

224
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,990
你就通融当作没见过我们吧！
Would you just pretend you did not see us?

225
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,030
怒难从命
Sorry. No, I can't do.

226
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,070
死洋鬼子！我们找人都不行呀？
You bastard, we are only searching for our friend.

227
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,990
他们老是把我们华人矿工不当人
They treat us Chinese miners like dogs,

228
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,150
我们都习惯
having all kinds of restrictions on us.

229
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,630
可是他们老是欺负我们
Yeah! We are always on the wrong side.

230
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,190
这里只有他一个人，把他干掉
Shall we stand together and overcome him now?

231
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,270
不不…警长对我们中国人算不错了
No... The sergeant is nice to us Chinese indeed!

232
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,550
你不记得嘛？

233
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,540
有几次他把欺负我们的洋鬼子赶走呀！

234
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,270

235
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,310
喂
Hey!

237
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,710
记住，这儿绝不容许中国女人前来
Remember, no Chinese women allowed here.

238
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,670
此乃本地法例
That's the law.

239
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,830
我会记住的了
I will not forget.

240
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,950
“林肯”先生，后会有期
Goodbye, Mr Lincoln.

241
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,990
你别袒心，黄飞鸿定必吉人天相
Don't worry Ma'am. Wong Fei-hong.is gonna be just fine.

242
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,590
喂！你在干嘛？
Hey! What are you doing here?

243
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,510
再动手动脚，就对你不客气
Behave yourself or I won't give you face.

244
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,270
什么
What?

245
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,870
“WHAT”你的妈！
"What"? The hell!

246
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,880
“WHAT你的妈”！我喜欢呀！
What the hell? I like that.

247
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,590
十三姨，雨下得很大，进去吧
It's raining dogs and cats, please go back inside.

248
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,710
不行！我怕飞鸿回来找不到门口
No, Fai-hong won't find us when he is back.

249
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,150
如果你冷病了，师傅会很心痛
Master would be upset if you fell sick.

250
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,190
对，十三姨，进去吧

251
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,300
让开…
Give way...

252
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,630
你们看什么？
What are you guys looking at?

253
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,350
看女人呀
It is a woman.

254
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,710
女人有什么好看？
What's so excited about a woman?

255
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,590
汉叔，你这么老，还看？
Uncle Han, don't you think.you're too old for that?

256
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,360
我不能做点什么，但看看总可以吧
But I can still see well with my eyes.

257
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,190
走吧！走吧！今天不开门呀！
Shoot! We are closed for business today.

258

262
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,630
好…
Good!... Good!...

263
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,430
阿苏，你在吃什么？
Sol, what are you eating?

264

那是浆糊！

265
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,750
黏不黏呀？

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,510
黏呀，黏呀

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,910
你…你又说“GOOD”！
And you! Why did you say it tastes good?

268
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,270
我没说，我只是点头而已
I did not! I was only nodding.

269
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,950
你们帮我拿些寻人启事到街上去贴

你们为什么把我们的寻人启示撕掉？

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,780
这个哩
This!

289
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,590
可以教我吗？
Can you show me?

290
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,550
你想练腿功呀？
You want to learn leg stance?

291
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,870
不怕辛苦就成了！
If not you can put up with the hardship.

292
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,870
像我这样！
Like this!

293
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,590
每天压腿两个时辰！
Press each of your legs like this for 4 hours.

294
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,630
那就成了！
That's all it takes.

295
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,270
好的
Alright.

296
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,270
小子，你们被捕了
OK boys, you're under arrest,

297
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,550
监狱就在那边
the jail's that way.

298
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,950
放心，一切已在我控制之中
Take it easy partner..I've got everything under control.

299
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,710
走吧
Yeah, move it.

300
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,350
好的，来吧
Alright come on.

301
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,190
请问阁下高姓大名？
What do they call you son?

302
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,540
我叫比利
My name is Billy!

303
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,590
比利，你可有兴趣做我的副手？
Billy, interested in being my deputy?

304
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,510
让我拿到奖金才说吧
We'll talk after I get my reward.

305
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,790
NICK
Nick

306
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,310
数完了没有？
You done yet?

307
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,830
真讨厌！
God damn Sheriff

308
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,030
给你吵一吵我又要从头再数了！
you made me lose my count..Now I have to start all over again.

309
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,630
警长，出手太低了吧？
Sheriff, the pay is bad.

310
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,310
工作又缠身
I've to cut partial of my freedom.

311
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,190
我明白了
I understand!

312
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,630
你大可在我有困难时才前来解围
You can come to work with me.only when there is a trouble.

313
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,510
一言为定
Sheriff, you got yourself a deputy.

314
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,590
那么…试试这个吧
Good, try this on for size.

315
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,710
如碰见到这个男人，请来诊所通知我们
Hi, if you see this man, we're at the clinic.

316
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,390
如碰见到这个男人，请来诊所通知我们
If you see this man, we're at the clinic.

317
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,070
赏面喝一杯吗？
How about a drink?

318
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,500
恕我失陪
No, thank you.

319
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,110
我要你喝
When I say drink,

320
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,630
你便要喝
you drink.

321
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,190
放开她
Hey! Leave her alone.

322
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,590
住口
You shut up.

323
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,310
再来一个
Have another.

324
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,790
好标致的中国娃娃啊！
You are a pretty China doll.

325
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,630
你走那么快干什么？
Hey lady where are you going?

326
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,630
你要是不喝
If you don't want to drink.

327
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,110
只好照头淋了
Then wear it!

328
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,630
不要！住手！
Stop it stop it stop it...

329
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,390
十三姨…十三姨
Aunt Yee! Aunt Yee.

330
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,430
若我是你们，便绝不这般无聊
Now all the boys,.I wouldn't do that if I were you,

331
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,910
你想打架，在下乐意奉陪
you wanna fight, well, you've got one.

332
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,790
我不是要生事
I aint looking for no fight.

333
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,140
太好了！
That's good.

334
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,710
我不服气，阿七，帮我教训他们
Now I want a fight! Seven, teach them a lesson.

335
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,780
好
Sure!

336
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,830
我们不如试点新意
Why don't we try something different, pal?

337
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,870
来一场友谊赛怎么样？
Care for a friendly wager?

338
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,750
我赌这个中国人不用枪便可把你击倒
Now I bet this Chinamen can wipe you.out without your guns.

339
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,790
我将赌注全押在他身上
And my money is on the Chinamen, pal

340
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,030
你们哪个先上？
which one is man enough to fight him?

341
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,710
我赢了！
I win!

342
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,710
不行！趁师傅不在，要打个够
No, this is only good for a warm up.since master isn't around.

343
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,780
阿苏，翻译
Sol, translate for me.

344
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,670
什么？
What?

345
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,100
叫他们全部一起上
Tell them to fight me all at once.

346
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,350
如果都能打赢我的，都算他们赢！
They are the winner if anyone of them beat me.

347
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,790
他说什么？
What did he say?

348
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,670
他叫你们一起上
He said he wants to fight you all.

349
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,670
如果你们赢了，钱就归你们
If you win, you can keep the money.

350
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,870
全都一起上？且’慢
All? Wait a minute,

351
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,750
我们会输的
we might lose!

352
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,870
阿七，他说你如…
Seven, he said if...

353
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,990
相信我
Trust me.

354
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,420
相信我
Trust me.

355
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,910
对不起！相信他才是
Sorry! Trust him!

356
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,150
乐死我了！
I am a happy man.

357
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,300
我也是！
Me too.

358
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,790
十三姨，你呢？
Aunt Yee, what about you?

359
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,750
我也一样
Me too.

360
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,670
谢谢！
Thank you!

361
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,780
我现在那有心情看风景呀
How can I enjoy this beautiful landscape now?

362
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,950
不如你带我去你们找到我的那个地方
Why don't you take me back to where you found me?

363
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,620
也许我会想起我是从那里来的
Maybe I can remember where I come from.

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,670
不过你都不知道我在讲什么
Only you have no idea on what I am saying.

365
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,790
衣服，你要是会说话就好了
Clothes, how I wish you could talk.

366
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,830
你可以告诉我，我到底是谁呀？
Then you would be able to explain everything.

367
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:44,150
师傅…金山…开宝芝林…一周年…
Master... America... Setting up Po Chi Lam....One year anniversary,

368
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,790
牙擦…
Sol...

369
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,430
这封信是我写给别人的
What's this letter about?

370
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,310
还是别人写给我的呢？
Is it by me or for me?

371
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,190
难道我叫牙擦
My name is Sol?

372
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,830
师傅？！我有个师傅
... and I have a master?

373
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,900
那我找到他，我就什么都知道了
I must find him, he will have the answer.

374
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,670
黄飞！
Wong Fai!

375
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,950
我一定认识他
I must have known him.

376
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,350
如果找到他我就知道我是谁了
If I found him, everything would be explained.

377
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,390
有何贵干？
What can I do for you?

378
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,870
我要娶你的女儿
I want to marry your daughter!

379
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,070
你岂敢侮辱我妹妹？
How dare you insult my sister?

380
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,350
你们是最弱的部落
You are the weakest among all the tribes,

381
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,160
若你拒绝将女儿嫁我，我就灭你全族
if you don't give me your daughter,.I will destory you all.

382
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,030
战鹰
Fierce Eagle!

383
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,510
我们不怕你，我们会战斗到底
We are not afraid of you,.we will fight you to death!

384
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,750
战鹰
Fierce Eagle!

385
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,830
请不要动手
Please, do not fight!

386
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,910
喂，不要
Hey, don't...

387
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,950
阿黄，别跟他打
Yellow, please do not fight him.

388
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,790
喂…
Hey...

389
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,990
来吧！
Come on!

390
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,110
让我试试看！
Let me try.

391
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,550
你想怎样？
What are you doing?

392
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,950
住手！
Stop it. Don't!

393
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,980
咦！痊愈了
I'm good, I'm good...

394
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,910
我真的很羡慕你们
I really envy you guys.

395
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,150
起码你们知道这里就是你们的家
At least you know where is your root.

396
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,870
我就不知道我的家在那里
I don't even know where I come from.

397
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,110
这儿的阳光好美
The sunshine's beautiful on this land,

398
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,110
但我们家乡的阳光更美
but the sunshine is more beautiful on our land.

399
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,070
可惜我们被迫远走他乡
But, we were forced to leave our home.

400
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,830
我说什么你也不知道
You don't understand a bit of what I'm saying.

401
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,830
也好，起码你们很幸福
That's fine, at least you are lucky.

402
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,510
不用像我似的
Unlike me,

403
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,750
整天在想，我要回到那里去！
I keep thinking where I should be heading.

404
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,190
我知道，我终会有日回到自己故乡
I know, someday I shall return to my land

405
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,990
回到自己的家
to my home.

406
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,310
这是感谢你为我们族人出气
For bleeding for our tribe.

407
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,110
谢谢
Thank you.

408
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,230
以后大家有什么话都不用说
From now on, verbal communication.is not necessary.

409
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,870
你拍我，我拍你，那不就好了吗？
Body language is much better, right?

410
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,350
说了忘记它，又常常想起它
I tried to forget,.but the vision keeps coming back.

411
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,110
真是烦
Damn it!

412
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,830
忘记它，忘记它
I must learn to let go.

413
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,780
阿黄
Yellow!

414
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,870
你喜欢？!
You like it?

415
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,300
拿去
Take it!

416
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,870
飞鸿！抽烟吧
Fai-hong, have a smoke!

417
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,350
惨啦，惨啦！十三姨脑子有问题
Oh shit! Aunt Yee is being possessed.

418
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,180
不是…不是脑子有问题
Nah, it is not that.

419
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,670
那是什么？
What's it then?

420
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,630
十三姨是睹物思人！
Master's stuff reminds her of him.

421
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,310
睹物思人？!
Master?

422
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,350
我都跟你说过，抽烟对身体不好
Though I did not like you to smoke,

423
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,590
不过，现在好不好都没有关系了
it isn't my main concern now.

424
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,600
他拉屎怎么去了那么久？
What is taking him so long to take a shit?

425
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,990
难道你想吃吗？
Are you hungry?

426
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,630
去你的
Take your shit.

427
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,350
来啊！
Come on...

428
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,110
来啊！
Come on...

429
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,070
来啊！
Come on...

430
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,390
来啊！

I am fine!

570
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,910
阿七
Seven.

571
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,260
你怎么撞得这么厉害！
How did you fall so badly?

572
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,790
不是撞的
It wasn't from falling.

573
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,030
师傅，是你打的
Master, you hit me!

574
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,110
阿七，好了…
It's okay now, Seven.

575
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,150
师傅回来了！
The Master is back!

576
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,830
这次来金山，真的像发了一场春梦
This trip to America is just like a dream.

577
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,590
有个异国情人陪伴左右
I can do with a dream

578
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,150
这种春梦才不怕发
with an Indian beauty.

579
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,430
什么情人？
What?

580
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,990
那要问你才知道
Only you know the story!

581
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,430
我不是刚擦过了吗？
I've just cleaned my face.

582
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,910
介指可以送两遍！面不可以再擦一次吗？
You can give the ring twice,.but you can't wash your face twice?

583
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,260
可以，可以
Sure, sure.

584
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,350
不过你说什么我都没有什么印像！
I can't remember anything.

585
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,190
我也不明白你在说什么
I don't understand what you're talking about.

586
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,350
有没有想那个女人？
Have you thought of that woman?

587
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,270
没想女人！那里有空！
I don't have time to think about woman.

588
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,070
那有没有念她？
Do you miss her?

589
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,830
那就有！
Well, a little bit.

590
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,270
你刚才不是说没有想她吗？
You just said you haven't thought of woman.

591
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,390
想跟念是两件事来的
Thinking and missing are two different things.

592
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,390
不想又怎会念呢？
If you don't think of her, how can you miss her?

593
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,670
事实是这样！
But it's the truth.

594
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,350
事实是不想跟你讲！
The truth is I don't want to talk to you anymore.

595
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,790
我念着的那个，不就是你了！
But the one I miss is you.

596
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,070
你明知道这方面
You know I can never say,

597
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,150
我从来都不直接说出来的！
these things out loud.

598
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,910
开局啦，走快点！
The games are about to start. Hurry!

599
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,390
黄师傅，黄师傅
大家好，大家好
- Master Wong..- How's everyone?

600
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,270
师傅
师傅
- Master.- Master

601
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,230
师傅你找什么？
What are you looking for?

602
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,950
我想去那边看看！
I want to go there to have a see

603
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,350
黄师傅来了，龙叔！黄师傅来了！
Master Wong is here..Uncle Lone, Master Wong is here.

604
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,350
黄师傅来了又怎么样？
So?

605
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,950
黄师傅不喜欢人家赌钱的
Master Wong doesn't like people gambling.

606
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,630
我们先收拾，迟些时候再赌
Let's pack it up and gamble later.

607
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,430
不…怎么可以，我买了一
No way,

608
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,670
现在开一嘛，怎可以算数！
I've just won this game.

609
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,230
真的来了，黄师傅真的来了
Master is coming!

610
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,790
你赢钱了？玩多大呀？
Have you won? How much did you bet?

611
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,150
我也玩
不是很大
- I want in. Let's gamble together..- Just a little bit

612
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,870
我也来！
Come on!

613
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,380
师傅在干什么？
What?

614
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,780
黄师傅也来？
Master Wong, you too?

615
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,190
来！给我做座好不好？
Come, let me be the House.

616
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,630
来来来，来来来，大家买多点，来来来…
Come on, come on! Let's have some larger bets.

617
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,390
真的？
Really?

618
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,630
真的！多多益善，多多益善
Sure! Bet more!

619
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,030
买吧！黄师傅叫买，买一点点吧
Okay, if Master Wong wants us to,.we'll bet a little.

620
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,510
师…师…师傅…
Master...

621
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,310
买定离手，买定离手
Bets down and hands off.

622
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,510
反正大家那么多钱，又没有地方用
You've got nowhere to spend your money anyway.

623
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,270
全部买下去吧
Why don't you bet it all?

624
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,350
黄师傅，你是我们的希望
Master Wong, you are our hope,

625
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,830
你也这样，我们还有幻想吗？
you gamble like us, how can we find a role model?

626
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,350
真不习惯，黄师傅你还是做回平常的你吧
We are not used to seeing you gambling..Master Wong, why don't you be your normal self?

627
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,500
我们不赌了
We won't gamble anymore...

628
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,110
今天！
Today.

629
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,510
走吧！走吧！
Get out of here!

630
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,230
明白啦！
We understand now.

631
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,030
各位
People,

632
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,150
其实我今天来…
I thank you all,

633
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,030
是想感谢大家对我黄飞鸿的关心
for your concern.

634
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,430
我有几句话，想跟大家说
I have something to say.

635
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,870
大家千里迢迢
You came a long way...

636
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,910
漂洋过海来到这个陌生的地方…
to a foreign place,

637
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,070
宝芝林的开设也就是为了这一点…
Po Chi Lam was opened for this reason.

638
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,390
正所谓人离乡贱，物离乡贵…
When they leave home, goods are worth more.and people are worth less.

639
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,550
更加要知道自己是谁…
And you should know who you are.

640
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,870
我并不希望宝芝林生意发达…
I don't hope for good business,.that'll require you being ill.

641
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,950
我希望的是宝芝林可以贯彻一贯的精神…
Rather I hope Po Chi Lam.help you achieve good health,

642
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,590
养精蓄锐，强身健体…
build up a strong body.

643
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,550
取洋人之长，补国人之短…
Copy the merits of foreigners.and compensate our short-comings.

644
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,550
为中华民族发出百分热，耀光千分光！
And shine for the Chinese people.

645
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,150
其实，简单来说
Simply put,

646
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,310
大家记住自己是谁
you must remember who you are.

647
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,270
我今天就暂时说这么多，多谢大家赏面
Today, I would like to stop here,.thank you for listening.

648
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,630
黄师傅，你刚才说的话的确高明
Master Wong, that was a great speech.

649
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,510
客气…
You're too kind...

650
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,430
走吧，走吧
Let's go...

651
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,220
大叔，把钱带起来，赚点钱不容易
Sir, take the money, it was hard-earned.

652
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,310
黄师傅，不要再讲啦，再见，再见！
Master Wong, no more speech please.

653
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,700
请…请
Please excuse me...

654
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,150
你的金矿已经挖空了
Your gold mines dried up.

655
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,070
是的
Yeah.

656
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:59,070
你还有十五万的贷款我还未入账
There's still a little matter of the $1 50,000 loan,.I've discreetly left off the books.

657
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,310
你的口比牛屎更臭
Damn your smell like a pail of dung.

658
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,750
来，试试这个吧
Here, try some of these.

659
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,870
或者可以帮你消除口气
Maybe it'll help your breath.

660
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,310
还有十万元在夹万里，我自可解决一切
Put a $100,000 is in the safe..I'll take care of everything else.

661
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,670
什么？再要十万块？
What? Another $100,000.

662
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,630
照我说话做吧
Do as I say.

663
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,390
蒙着脸呀
Keep your faces covered,

664
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,940
我不想你们身分曝光
I want your identities kept secret.

665
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,270
我会在邮局甚至沿密西西比河岸…
I'd mark pretty face on.every post office and board...

666
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,630
都有我的通缉艳照！
besides the Mississippi Hell.

667
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,670
我想出名啊！
I want to be famous.

668
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,350
住口
Shut up!

669
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,510
不怕！去吧
I don't give a damn, let's just do it.

670
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,510
行啦，黄师傅不会再来啦
Let's do it, Master Wong won't come this time.

671
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,230
怎么了？
Why?

672
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,870
他没空，来吧！
He is real busy. Come on!

673
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,710
我做庄，买买买
I'll be the House. Bet. Bet. Bet.

674
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,020
发粮啦
It's pay day!

675
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,310
阿七呀，我在家中排行十一
Seven, I'm the 1 1th child of my family.

676
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,550
你叫阿七，如果我们开便利店
And I was thinking, if you and.I should open a store together,

677
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,590
就叫7-11好了
we'll call it 7-1 1.

678
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,590
汉叔，那个人干什么的？
Uncle Han, who is that guy?

679
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,980
他是我们领班来的，常常压诈我们！
He is our foreman, and always cheat us.

680
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,750
脚法快又怎么样？
So what if you can kick real fast?

681
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,670
别忘记这里是枪的世界
Don't forget, this is a world of guns.

682
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,510
怎么快也快不过子弹
You can't be as fast as a bullet.

683
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,430
你拿了钱吧？
Have you got the money?

684
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,190
我们走了
Go on and get out of here.

685
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,710
我想我们有…
I thought we had a...

686
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,590
永别
Adios.

687
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,960
太容易得手了！我们找点刺激好了
Hell, that's too easy,.let's find some real excitement.

688
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,150
枪战一定很刺激
When they start to shoot, that would be exciting.

689
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,270
走！走！
Get back, get out.

690
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,270
比利
Billy.

691
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,630
你干什么？
What are you doing?

692
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,350
你这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

693
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:30,790
你没什么吧？
Yeah, you're alright.

694
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,390
你没事吧？
You alright, Billy?

695
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,790
五十万？
Half a million dollars?

696
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,830
（银行被劫五十万）
"HALF A MILLION ROBBED"

697
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,830
我们回去小镇问镇长好了
Let's go back and pay the Mayor.and his little town a visit.

698
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,350
阿彼他怎么了？他好像不行了
What about Pete? He isn't gonna to make it.

699
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,070
阿彼，我送你一程！
Adios, Pete!

700
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,190
小心
Watch out!

701
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,670
师傅
Master.

702
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,110
黄师傅
Master Wong.

703
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,950
大家好！
你好
- How's everyone?.- How are you?

704
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,710
黄师傅，挂新招牌呀
Master Wong, is that a new sign?

705
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,630
是的
Yes.

706
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,150
各位！今天我有一些话要跟大家说
People, I have something to say today.

707
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,230
黄师傅，你又有话说呀？
Master, you have something to say again?

708
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,790
不用说啦！不如耍套十字拳来看看吧
Why don't you show us some fist dance.instead of a speech?

709
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,870
对呀！对呀！看看呀
Yeah, come on! Show us.

710
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,670
耍拳！耍拳吧
Show us some fist dance! Come on.

711
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,790
有机会，有机会
You'll get the chance!

712
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,550
今天是金山宝芝林成立一周年的纪念日
Today is the first anniversary.of the American Po Chi Lam.

713
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,430
首先我要感谢大家对我劣徒阿苏的照顾
First of all, I would like to thank you all.for taking care of my student Sol.

714
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,510
不要这样说！大家都是中国人
Don't mention it, we are all Chinese!

715
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,910
应该守望相助，互相照顾！对吗？
We should help each other, right?

716
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,820
各位！大家千里迢迢，飘洋过海
People, you've come a long way...

717
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,790
来到这一个陌生的地方
to a foreign place.

718
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,030
很应该要守望相助，互相照顾
You should co-operate and take care of each other.

719
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,870
宝芝林的开设，也是希望可以做到这一点
Po Chi Lam was opened for this reason.

720
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:27,190
但是我不希望宝芝林生意兴隆财源广进
I don't hope for good business,

721
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,910
因为这样代表大家病痛多多
that'll require you being ill.

722
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,190
我希望的是…
Instead, I hope that...

723
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,390
美国宝芝林是大家侨居海外的后花园
The American Po Chi Lam would.become your club house,

724
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,670
大家有时间坐下来喝杯茶，聊聊天耍耍拳
when you have time, you can have tea,.chat, and practise Kung-fu here.

725
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,340
养精蓄锐，强身健体
Build up a strong body.

726
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,030
我更加希望能贯彻宝芝林的一贯精神
And come in line with Po Chi Lam's spirit.

727
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:52,550
共同奋斗，取洋人之长，补国人之短
Hand in hand we copy foreigners' merits.and compensate our short-comings.

728
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,790
为中国人发出百点热，耀出千分光
And shine for the Chinese people.

729
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,030
讲完
That's all.

730
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,870
大家请进来，吃些点心呀
Come in! Refreshment time!

731
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,910
好呀！好呀！吃点心啦…
Let's go and have some snacks...

732
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,830
师傅呀，刚刚是不是应该先有些掌声呢？
Master, I think your speech.deserved some applause.

733
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,870
可能是，十三姨出来的…
Aunt Yee may come...

734
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,990
TIMING不是太好！
the timing of Aunt Yee's presence wasn't right.

735
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,390
时间
Timing.

736
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:36,830
时间
Timing!

737
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,950
对！对！
Right!

738
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,830
大家不用客气，还有很多
Make yourself at home, there's still more...

739
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,830
欢迎呀各位
Welcome... Mr. Mayor,

740
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,910
你大驾光临令我们受宠若惊！
gentlemen, we're pretty surprised.

741
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,870
有什么喜庆事么？
Looks like you're having a celebration.

742
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,750
进去吧！
Get in there men!

743
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,150
我怀疑你们与银行劫案有关
I reckon you boys have something to do.with the robbery.

744
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,030
搜！
Search the damn place.

745
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,990
怎么会哩！
No! It's ridiculous!

746
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,590
大家不要吵
Quiet!

747
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,150
他说我们跟抢劫银行的事有关
They said we were involved in the robbery,

748
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,990
现在要搜查这里
they want to search this place.

749
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,990
好！清者自清
No problem, we are innocent!

750
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,070
大家站在一边，不要打扰捕头做事
Give way, let the police do their job.

751
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,910
让他搜吧！
Let them search this place.

752
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,510
我们找到赃款了
We've found the money!

753
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:04,150
哗，真的有呀？怎么可能发生？
What? How can it be?

754
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,550
看我们搜到什么！
Look what we have got here.

755
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,550
拘捕在场所有中国人
Arrest every last one of these Chinese,.sons of bitches!

756
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,910
黄师傅不要乱来呀，人命关天！
Be careful, Master, they will shoot!

757
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,950
走！
Move!

758
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,060
警长大人，我们是清白的，放我们出去呀
We're innocent, let us out!

759
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,230
你不可以把他们关进牢的
You can't put these people in jail.

760
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,510
他们根本与此案无关
They had nothing to do with the robbery.

761
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,100
还用你指点？
You don't tell me what I can and can't do, Billy!

762
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,110
别闹了，比利
Now settle down son.

763
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,310
案发时我跟阿七和阿苏在一起
Look, I was with Doc Sol and Seven.right before the hold-up.

764
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,700
他们是被诬陷的！
They've been framed.

765
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,630
我不管你有什么理由
I don't give a damn if you come up.with a hundred reasons.

766
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,910
我们在宝芝林发现赃款，证据确凿
The fact is we found some of the stolen money.in Po Chi Lam.

767
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,150
不是中国人抢劫，还有谁？
If the Chinamen didn't take the money, who did?

768
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,910
我呀？
Me?

769
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,510
也许是比利你
Maybe it was you Billy!

770
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,510
神经病！我还击中其中一个劫匪哩
No! That's crazy! I shot one of'em.

771
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,310
也许你想灭口！
Maybe you were trying to throw us off.

772
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,510
说不定你正是贼人同党
Maybe you're working with the gang.

773
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,150
比利，别乱来
Easy there, Billy.

774
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,990
别轻举妄动
I wont let you do it.

775
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,590
你阻止得了吗？
How are you going to stop me?

776
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,990
我杀了你
I'll kill you.

777
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,910
你没事吧？
Are you alright?

778
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,390
没想到他们先下手为强
I guess someone was quicker at that time.

779
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,350
你是中国人的真正朋友
You're a real friend to the Chinese.

780
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,910
比利，I 欣赏你 T00
Billy! I appreciate you too!

781
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,030
安静！听我说几句话
Settle down. I said settle down.

782
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,550
他说他帮我们争取最好的条件
He said he would get the best deal for us,

783
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,500
只要我们交出七个人认罪
provided that 7 of us would confess to the crime,

784
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,190
我们认了罪要判囚多久？
If we confess, do we go jail?

785
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,550
不会判囚
You can forget jail,

786
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,110
你们只会被问吊
they are going to hang you.

787
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,110
如你不认罪，所有人都要被问吊
If you don't confress to the crime,.they're going to hang you all.

788
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,550
记住，赃款在你们中国人的地方找到
Remember, they found the money with you Chinese.

789
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,110
不！不关所有中国人的事
No, not all the Chinese,

790
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,150
只关宝芝林的人的事嘛
only the Po Chi Lam people.

791
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,430
你说对不对
Am i right?

792
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,630
不关我们事的，黄师傅！
Master Wong, non of my business

793
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,710
龙叔说得对
Uncle Lone is right.

794
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,150
这件事的确是宝芝林的事，与其他人无关
This is Po Chi Lam's problem,.nothing to do with you all.

795
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,660
阿苏，你跟警长说
Sol, tell the sergeant,

796
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,350
我一个人担当行不行？
can I take all the responsibility?

797
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,140
不行！
No!

798
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,980
师傅，不要说你一个人担当
You can't confess to the crime alone.

799
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,990
就算师傅你认第一个
If you are going to be the first to confess,

800
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,070
我阿苏就认第二个
I'll be the second.

801
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:53,830
阿苏！
Sol!

802
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,670
师傅，我叫阿七
Master, my nick name is Seven,

803
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,510
我不是第三个，也是第七个！
if I am not the 3rd one, I will be the 7th one.

804
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,300
飞鸿
Fai-hong.

805
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,590
你们都别去，让我一个人来认
You all stay here, I'll go alone.

806
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,070
这次分明是冤狱
This is a set up!

807
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,670
黄师傅，你年青有为，一代宗师
Master Wong, you are young and capable.

808
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,150
应该留着宝贵的生命
Your life should be...

809
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,350
来帮我们华工做点事情
spared for the good of we Chinese workers.

810
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,190
阿汉！你不是宝芝林的人
You've nothing to do with Po Chi Lam,

811
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,430
不要多管闲事吧
don't get yourself into trouble!

812
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,870
大叔！我们不是写华工血泪史
Uncle, we are not telling others.the pathetic tales of the Chinese workers.

813
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,270
要写也是写华工光辉史
We want to tell the glorious history.of the Chinese workers.

814
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,310
我黄飞鸿就一定要站出来
I, Wong Fai-hong, should stand for all of you.

815
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,990
谁不同意？
Who disagrees?

816
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,830
来吧！
Come with me.

817
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,190
小姐，我去
Ma'am!

818
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,230
飞鸿！
Fai-hong.

819
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,270
都…都是我闯的祸
It's my fault!

820
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:15,190
想不到一年前来美国开宝芝林分店
I couldn't imagine that, the establishment.of Po Chi Lam in the America a year ago,

821
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,230
原来是为了这场浩劫铺路
would pave the way for tragedy.

822
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,230
还…连累了师傅你！
And I dragged Master down too...

823
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,230
汉叔！你怕不怕？
Uncle Han, are you afraid?

824
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:32,270
讨老婆生子，勤做工讨吃
Getting married and working hard,

825
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,150
在家扮皇帝，在外做奴隶
pretending as emperor at home.but working as slave outside...

826
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,260
这样就一辈子了
That is my life!

827
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:49,380
我们中国人的传统是死也要做只饱鬼
Sir, it is our custom,.man would die with a full stomach.

828
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,150
请问我可以喂饱他们么？
May I feed them?

829
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,630
死囚临死时会享用最后一顿饱饭
All the prisoners get their final meal.before they're executed.

830
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,310
也不妨吧
What can it hurt?

831
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,950
黄师傅
Master Wong.

832
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,510
我能做的…就只有这一点
This is all I can do.

833
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,980
黄师傅，有馅的
Master Wong, stuffed dumplings for you.

834
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,390
吃吧！
Eat!

835
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,510
师傅，靠你啦
Master, we all depend on you.

836
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,910
师傅，我对你有信心
Master, I have full confidence in you.

837
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,430
喂，再来一个呀
I want more!

838
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,270
还有其他人没吃
They're waiting!

839
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,150


840
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,430


841
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,230
为什么我们全给抓进去，你没有呢？
Why were you not in jail with us?

842
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,670
我没有做什么事情
I didn't do anything.

843
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,270
我没有…你错了！
