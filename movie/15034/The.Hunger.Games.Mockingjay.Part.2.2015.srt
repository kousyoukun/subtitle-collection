2
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,280
Okay.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,010
Okay.
I know, I know.

4
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,430
I'm sorry,
I know it's a little tender.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,030
Okay.
Let's try your voice now.

6
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,680
My name is Katniss Everdeen,
I'm from District 12.

7
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,660
My...

8
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,970
Okay, take your time.

9
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,540
You got a lot of swelling
in your vocal chords.

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,970
My...

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,460
name...

12
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,510
is...

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,470
Katniss

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,850
Everdeen.

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,320
I want...

16
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,090
I want to talk to him.

17
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,440
He needs time.

18
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,790
But...

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,040
We're trying something new today.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,480
He's been calmer with
the doctors, but...

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,320
They are strangers to him,
so...

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,780
We're gonna test his responses
on someone he remembers from home.

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,080
Someone he trust.

24
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,740
Send her in.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
Hey.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
Prim.

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,840
- How're you doing?
- She's too close.

28
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,540
- It's okay.
- How did you get here?

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,480
We're in District 13 now.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,280
It's a real place.
The stories are true.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,170
You were rescued.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,780
My family hasn't come to see me.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,500
There was an attack on 12.

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,380
Yes.

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,680
My family.

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,580
They didn't survive.

37
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,200
Because of Katniss.

38
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,200
- It's because of Katniss.
- It wasn't because of her.

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,720
- She tell you to say that.
- She didn't tell me anything.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,100
She's a liar, Prim.

41
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,920
It's the truth.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,860
Yeah.

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,680
What you're saying isn't real.

44
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,140
She sent you here
to talk to me.

45
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,720
- She knows you're here now.

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,120
It's okay.

47
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,980
She knows.
You can't trust her!

48
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,440
She's a monster!

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,100
She's a mutt!

50
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,260
The Capitol bring her
to destroy us!

51
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
Get her out of there.

52
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,460
Do you understand me!

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,200
You have to kill her, Prim!

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,360
You have...
to kill her!

55
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,900
- Katniss.
- She's a mutt!

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,220
- This is just the condition responds.
- Kill her!

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
- It's not him.
- She's a monster!

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
- She's a mutt!
- No, it's not him. 

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,100
She's a mutt!

60
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,700
Please, come in.

61
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,740
Will you excuse us?

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,320
- For just a moment.
- Of course.

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,100
Have a seat.

64
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm glad you're feeling better.

65
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,140
Snow has to pay
for what he's done.

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,440
I want to help the rebels
in any way I can.

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,060
It's hard to see Peeta this way.

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,280
That's not Peeta.

69
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,700
Send me to the Capitol.

70
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,880
I'll do anything.

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,920
I can't.

72
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,540
I can't send you there.

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,540
We can't get into the Capitol
until we control District 2.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,960
Then send me to 2.

75
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,740
You want me to
fire up our troops.

76
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,720
Call out to the loyalists,
You've seen what I can do.

77
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,920
Yes, I have.

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
I saw Peeta

79
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,500
before we left.

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
What'd you think?

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,820
Something selfish.

82
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,580
That you don't have to be
jealous of him anymore?

83
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
No.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,220
I don't stand a chance
if he doesn't get better.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,140
You'll never let him go.

86
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,840
What's going on in your head?

87
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,740
I don't know.

88
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,360
It's like kissing
someone who's drunk.

89
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,920
It doesn't count.

90
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,100
3 minutes before touch down.

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,920
Prepare for landing.

92
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,240
Wrap it up.

93
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,880
Last chance.
Go.

94
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,280
This is another version food
trapping resource.

95
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,240
This one is designed to blind,

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,900
the smoke clings to the eyes.

97
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,380
That's an application for
Hummingbird trap.

98
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,620
They're scared of people,
so they flee in this direction

99
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,400
to what they think is a safe haven.

100
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,160
Two tier explosion.

101
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,760
We'll have people enough time to
rush in and help the wounded.

102
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,240
A second bomb.

103
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,640
Right.

104
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,740
Second one goes off here.

105
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,180
I guess there are
no rules anymore

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,460
about what a person can do
to another person.

107
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,080
I don't think some of us use any
rule book when we hijacked Peeta.

108
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,820
Welcome to District 2.

109
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,020
I'm Corporal Homes.

110
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,600
If you'll follow me, please.

111
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,620
Don't worry.

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,740
That's how the loyals
say good morning.

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
President Coin, we're indebted
to you for the reinforcements

114
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,560
and the Mockingjay.

115
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,660
But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2
knows what we've been up against.

116
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,940
This is the Nut.

117
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,740
The Capitol's headquarters
for our offensive operations.

118
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,160
It's manned by both military and
civilian personnel from District 2.

119
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,820
As you can see, the fortress
lies so far beneath the bedrock,

120
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,880
it's untouchable.

121
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,920
Yesterday, we attempted to take
the northeastern gate.

122
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,660
Then we encountered from higher up
and we're forced to pull back.

123
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,940
We took heavy loses.

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,680
Could we create a decoy?
Send troops towards one of the gate

125
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,260
and just send an attack on another.

126
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, who's troops do you
propose as a decoy, Commander.

127
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,560
We have the Mockingjay.

128
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,420
Don't underestimate her.

129
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,780
We could use her to erode support.

130
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,080
She maybe be able to sway
some of the loyalists.

131
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,420
You've been underground
a long time, Madam Coin.

132
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,880
This isn't like the rest of Panem

133
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,080
Support for the Capitol runs deep here.

134
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,020
Then there's no sacrifice is too great.

135
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,360
We need to control the arsenal
inside that fortress.

136
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,420
Even with every District and it's alliance,

137
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,680
we are outgunned.

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,760
I won't commit my people to a
ground assault,  just to pillage weapons.

139
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
Commander Paylor.
Your people,

140
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,200
have suffered more than just as
anyone else in the hands of the Capitol.

141
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,820
Which is why I won't
condone a mass suicide.

142
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,720
If we don't take District 2,
we won't get in to the Capitol.

143
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,860
We'll be enough to disable the fortress,

144
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,500
instead of taking it.

145
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,380
What do you have in mind?

146
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,260
We think of it like a wolf den.

147
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,740
You're not going to fight your way in,
so you got two choices.

148
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,340
You trap the wolves inside
or you flush them out.

149
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,420
We can't attack straight on.

150
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Couldn't we use a hovercraft
to strike around it?

151
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,500
We use the mountains,
we have weak spots and peaks.

152
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,280
We could design the bomb to target
some sequence season seismic data.

153
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,460
Trigger avalanches.

154
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,600
Block all exits,
cut off their supplies.

155
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,260
You make it impossible for them
to launch their hovercraft.

156
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,180
Bury them alive.

157
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,280
We forfeit any chance
to control the weapons.

158
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,940
Yes, but we'd place
a weaken in Capitol.

159
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,300
There're civilians in there.

160
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,160
They should be given
a chance to surrender.

161
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,860
Use one of the supply
tunnels for the evacuees

162
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,740
That's a luxury we weren't given
when they fire-bombed 12.

163
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
There's got to be a better way.

164
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,300
I suggest we try the avalanche

165
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,020
but leave the train tunnel alone.

166
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
Civilians can escape into the square

167
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,840
where our armies will be
waiting for their surrender.

168
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,160
We should have every
available medic standing by.

169
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,380
And if they won't surrender?

170
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,680
Then we will need a compelling voice
to persuade them.

171
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,740
What's the difference, Katniss.

172
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,320
Crushing the enemy alive or blown them
out of the sky with one of Beetee's arrows,

173
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,380
it's the same thing.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,380
We were under attack
in District 8.

175
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,340
And that hovercraft
wasn't filled with civilians.

176
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,340
It doesn't matter.

177
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,460
Even those civilians are just mopping floors,
they're helping the enemy.

178
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,460
If they have to die,
I can live with that.

179
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,480
No one who supports
the Capitol is innocent.

180
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,680
With that kind of thinking
you can kill whoever you want.

181
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,500
You can send kids off to the
Hunger games to keep the Districts in line.

182
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,320
It's war, Katniss.

183
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,920
Sometimes killing isn't personal.

184
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Figure if anyone who knew that
it was you.

185
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,100
I, of all people
know that it's always personal.

186
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,560
Don't worry, Katniss.

187
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,480
There will be survivors.

188
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,900
Let's focus on what
it is you got to say.

189
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,960
- Now, Plutarch wrote a speech...
- I'm not saying that.

190
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay, I didn't think so.
Just...

191
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,620
Just remember you're talking to everybody.

192
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,080
And not just the rebels,
but the Capitol and the survivors into

193
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,060
want them to lay down their arms.

194
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,560
So, you might want to experiment with
a little sensitivity and warmth.

195
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,140
Make it quick, you're exposed.

196
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
This is Katniss Everdeen,

197
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,340
speaking to all of the loyalist
from the heart of District 2.

198
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,680
Survivors.
Inbound!

199
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,840
Ready!
Ready!

200
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,020
Guns up!

201
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,200
Arms are ready!
Guns up!

202
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,520
We got to get you back.

203
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,660
Here they come!

204
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,320
Everybody, stand back!

205
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,800
Everybody, go!

206
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
- On the ground!
- Get them off the train!

207
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
Put your weapons down.

208
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,760
Get on the ground!

209
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,180
Put your weapons down, now!

210
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Weapons down.

211
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,680
You, put it down.

212
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,520
- Put it...Put your weapons down!
- Drop it

213
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,480
Drop your weapon!

214
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,260
You, drop it!

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,180
Drop the gun!

216
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,580
Drop it!

217
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,780
- Hold your fire.
- Stop!

218
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Stop!

219
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,260
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

220
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,220
Hold your fire!

221
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,540
- He needs help!
- Hold your fire!

222
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,240
Drop it.

223
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,840
Give me one reason
I shouldn't shoot you.

224
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,240
Drop the gun!

225
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,960
I can't.

226
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,740
I guess that's the problem, isn't it?

227
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,180
We blew up your mine.

228
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,360
You burned my district to the ground.

229
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,080
We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.

230
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,820
So, if you want to kill me, do it.

231
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,400
Make someone happy.

232
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm tired
of killing slaves for him.

233
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm not a slave.

234
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,520
I am.

235
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,060
That's why I killed Cato...

236
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,540
and he killed Thresh...

237
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,200
and Thresh killed Clove.

238
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,640
It just goes around and around,
and who wins?

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,720
Always Snow.

240
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm done being
a piece in his Game.

241
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,140
District 12, District 2
we have no fight.

242
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,420
Except the one the Capitol gave us.

243
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,060
Why are you fighting the rebels?

244
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,260
Your neighbors?

245
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,140
Your family?

246
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,980
These people are not your enemy!

247
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,620
We all have all one enemy.

248
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,320
And that's Snow.

249
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,920
He corrupts everyone and everything.

250
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,420
He turns the best of us
against each other.

251
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,500
Stop killing for him!

252
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,660
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the Capitol.

253
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,520
Turn you weapons
to Snow.

254
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,120
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the Capitol.

255
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,660
Turn you weapons
to Snow.

256
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
Hold you fire!

257
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,900
A toast.

258
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,380
Antonius.

259
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,560
With our best troops
crushed in the mountains

260
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,300
and the rebels marching
on us as we speak.

261
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,260
What do we celebrate?

262
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,640
The death of the Mockingjay, Sir.

263
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,460
If Peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.

264
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,200
Of course.

265
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,220
That's the same facile thinking

266
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,900
that led you to divert our
best peacekeepers into District 2.

267
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,200
You have the habit of burying people
before they are dead.

268
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,440
If the Mockingjay were gone,

269
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,640
the rebels would already
be using her as a martyr.

270
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,980
No, Minister Antonius.

271
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm afraid that is not what
we were toasting at all.

272
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
Sir.

273
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,800
The rebels can be held off out...

274
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,880
The rebels will reach the
outskirts of the Capitol

275
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
in a matter of days.

276
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,540
We'll evacuate the outer blocks...

277
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,880
to let them in.

278
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,560
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready,

279
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,460
so we're secured from the skies.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,080
Lure them into the city

281
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,800
and then our gamemakers will make
them pay for every inch with blood.

282
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,060
I want every camera watching.

283
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,740
We will turn their advance
into a celebration of suffering.

284
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,480
Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.

285
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,040
So...

286
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,640
What do we toast tonight,
Minister Antonius?

287
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,680
We toast to the glorious era

288
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,000
coming to it's bitter end.

289
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,740
Well, there she is.

290
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,240
The Mockingjay.

291
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,640
Oh, that speech you gave.

292
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,180
Oh, man, the feel. I mean
I still have goose bumps.

293
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,840
You don't mind, do you?

294
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,100
They cut off my supply of morphine.

295
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,800
This head doctor that comes in and
sees me everyday, she tried to...

296
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,880
help me adjust to reality
like some...

297
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,400
Some guy from this rabbit warren
actually knows anything about my reality.

298
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,920
At least 20 times in a session
he tells me that I'm totally safe.

299
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
Safe from the Capitol.

300
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,240
Safe from Snow.

301
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,800
What about you, Mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?

302
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,240
Till I got shot.

303
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
Oh, please.

304
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,660
The bullet didn't even touched you.

305
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,400
Something they thought about.
Of course your costume would be bulletproof.

306
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,180
So, what are your injuries?

307
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,300
Bruised ribs.
Bruised lung.

308
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,220
I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.

309
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,520
Well, I got 2,
do you want one of mine?

310
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,220
I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.

311
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,060
Is that why you hate me?

312
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,140
Partly.

313
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,260
You're also a little hard to swallow.

314
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,040
The whole tacky romance drama and
the defender-of-the-helpless act.

315
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,860
Even though it's not an act.

316
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,460
Which makes you even
more unbearable.

317
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,420
Feel free to take
any of this personally.

318
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,180
You should have been the Mockingjay,
nobody has to tell you what to say.

319
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,980
But nobody likes me.

320
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,020
They're afraid of you.

321
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,280
Maybe here, but...

322
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,920
In the Capitol, you're the
only thing they're scared of.

323
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,500
It's just stuff my family brought.

324
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,940
This from Peeta?

325
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,820
Yeah.

326
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,420
He messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?

327
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,080
We showed him footage of your
speech in 2 (District 2).

328
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,820
He had real memories of you.

329
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,600
That still doesn't mean
I am going in there.

330
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,720
He's strapped down.
He can't hurt you.

331
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,120
No, This is different.

332
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,520
Haymitch, I really
don't want to.

333
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,700
Well, it doesn't matter what you want. It's for Peeta.

334
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,820
What's the harm in trying.

335
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,900
I watched you die.

336
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,680
- You look terrible.

337
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,840
- You looked better.

338
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,120
You're not remotely nice
to say that to me now.

339
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,620
I was never the nice one,
you were.

340
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,020
When I saw you die,

341
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
I remembered something.

342
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,160
About the bread.

343
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,640
I remember,
you in the rain.

344
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,220
And I burned it on purpose,

345
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,860
to give it to you.

346
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,080
I remember,
my mother hitting me.

347
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,460
I was supposed to
give it to the pig.

348
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,980
That was the first
I've eaten in days.

349
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,860
How did I take a beating
like that for you?

350
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,080
Because you are kind...

351
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,260
and generous.

352
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,280
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you loved me?

353
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,860
They said that's why
Snow tortured you.

354
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,240
To hurt me.

355
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,740
Snow says everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.

356
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,200
All I know is that I would have
saved myself a lot of suffering.

357
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,940
If I had just given
that bread to the pig.

358
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,660
I think the only thing left to say
is thank you.

359
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,860
I need to be in the Capitol.

360
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,800
No, you've done your job.

361
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,740
You've been very successful as the Mockingjay,
you've unified the Districts.

362
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,640
And now we want you to rest

363
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,120
and to heal.

364
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,726
The last of rebels saw me,
I was lying on the ground.

365
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,562
Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.

366
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,563
We will shoot more propos,
right here in 13.

367
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:22,067
Showing them that you're alive.

368
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:23,381
I should be with the troops.

369
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:25,286
It will be like being on the front line.

370
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,549
As far as the soldiers know,
you survived a bullet to the heart.

371
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:32,201
I think they will understand
why you're not with them.

372
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,340
When we win this war,

373
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,420
we'll fly you in for the surrender.

374
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,420
We'll need you for the ceremony.

375
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,000
You are very valuable to us.

376
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,080
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

377
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,280
From this day forward,

378
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,300
in sickness and in health,

379
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,380
for richer or poorer,

380
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,740
I promise to love and
cherish you each day.

381
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
I, Finnick Odair.

382
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,820
Take you, Annie Cresta as
my wife from this day forward,

383
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,480
together or apart,
we will always be united.

384
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,180
One life.

385
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,220
One purpose.

386
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,060
One destiny.

387
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,520
You may kiss the bride.

388
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,760
You saw Peeta, didn't you?

389
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,140
Would you tell him hi for me?

390
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,280
We're old friends, you know.

391
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,520
We had a joint in the
cells in the Capitol,

392
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,360
we're very familiar with
each other's screams.

393
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm going to kill Snow.

394
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,720
Nothing good is safe
while he's alive.

395
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,100
And I can't make
another speech about it.

396
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,140
No more cameras.

397
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,220
No more  propos.

398
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,540
No more games.

399
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,220
He needs to see my eyes
when I kill him.

400
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,940
Now you're talking.

401
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,520
Find a way to the Capitol when
everyone is looking the other way.

402
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,740
I heard the medics talking, they're
shipping supplies to the front line

403
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,020
from Hanger 2
around midnight, tonight.

404
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,580
Medicine, painkillers I was gonna go steal
some for myself,

405
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,700
but I guess I couldn't.

406
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,780
just stay here
and cover for you.

407
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,180
Anybody can kill anybody, Katniss,
even the president.

408
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,020
You just have to be
willing to sacrifice yourself.

409
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,800
Go on.

410
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,780
Don't you want Snow
to see you dance?

411
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,420
Hey, it's her.

412
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,880
It's Katniss Everdeen.

413
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,280
Hey.

414
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,900
- I thought you were in the hospital.
- I was.

415
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,080
Come on.

416
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,680
What is she doing?

417
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,780
Well, it's so frustrating
when she goes rogue.

418
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,360
This isn't just about a lesson,
it's insubordination.

419
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
Bring her on the
first hovercraft back.

420
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,360
Don't be ridiculous,
she can't come back now.

421
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,200
She's mythic.

422
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,920
At the front line,
surviving a gun shot wound...

423
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,640
I couldn't stage it better myself.

424
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,820
No.

425
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,940
She's going to stay
where she is.

426
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,780
And whatever she's doing,
we conceived it.

427
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,920
It was our plan all along.

428
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,740
Of course it was.

429
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,100
Mr. Heavensbee.

430
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,540
You are the gamemaker.

431
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,160
I want everyone to know
whatever game she's playing.

432
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,380
She's playing for us.

433
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,820
I'm commander Paylor of District 8.

434
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,700
I'm a soldier like
all of you, so...

435
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,280
Here's what I know.

436
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,860
For the first time in our lifetimes,
we're standing together with 13 districts.

437
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,100
From what I see here,
we've already made history.

438
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,860
But history doesn't stop to celebrate.

439
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,380
And we're facing an enemy that will
not change and will never surrender.

440
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,860
President Snow has pulled back peacekeepers
to fortify the center of the city.

441
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,660
He's evacuating residents
from the outer blocks.

442
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,140
The civilians will be
confused and desperate.

443
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,980
You are under orders
not to target them.

444
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,520
We are deploying medical brigades
to help anyone in need.

445
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,040
We'll show the Capitol people
who we are.

446
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,100
To slow our advance, President Snow
is building a minefield of traps.

447
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,660
And lethal devices called "Pods".

448
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,200
The sadistic inventions of gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths.

449
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,480
If our armies make it pass
peacekeepers and other defenses,

450
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,820
we'll converge in the center
of the city at Snow's mansion

451
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,660
Where we won't just
unlock his gates,

452
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
but unshackle all of Panem.

453
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,860
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

454
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,340
If we die...

455
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,100
Let it be for a cause
and not a spectacle.

456
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,980
If we succeed, let it be for all
of Panem and let it be forever.

457
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,160
Yes, you already made history.

458
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,480
But the future...

459
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,880
Our future starts tomorrow at dawn.

460
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,500
When we march together
into the Capitol.

461
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,700
Squad 451?

462
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,140
Looks like you got
your meals covered.

463
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,480
- I'm trying to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.

464
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,240
We've been hunting
together all our lives.

465
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,240
I know when you're going
to go off on your own.

466
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,340
You're gonna leave me behind too?

467
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
As your fellow soldier,

468
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,360
I suggest that
you stay with your unit.

469
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.

470
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,900
Hawthorne.
Everdeen.

471
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,300
Come meet your new unit.

472
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,520
I'm Lieutenant Jackson.

473
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,780
And I want to introduce
you to your squad.

474
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,180
This is the second lieutenant Mitchell.
The best sharp shooter in Panem.

475
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,720
These are the Leeg sisters,
First Combat Division.

476
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,640
And this is Corporal Holmes.

477
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,820
Finnick?

478
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,580
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

479
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,060
That's a short honeymoon.

480
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,860
Yeah.
Well...

481
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,420
I guess we got to have one
in the Capitol.

482
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,120
- After we take it.
- Gather around.

483
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,080
Squadron 451.

484
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,020
You’re my unit.

485
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,480
Lieutenant Jackson is my second in command.

486
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,860
Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.

487
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,880
But we are a non-combat unit,

488
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,700
so, we'll be following a days behind
the front line troops.

489
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,180
You are to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.

490
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,000
The Star squad.

491
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,380
It's been decided that you are most
effective when seen by the masses.

492
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,440
So, we're not going to fight?

493
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,100
You do whatever you
are ordered to do, soldiers.

494
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,660
It's not your job
to ask questions.

495
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,160
Yes, sir.

496
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,200
Our instructions are to shoot
propaganda footage

497
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,040
on the battle scars
troop to the Capitol.

498
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,880
You are handpicked to
intimidate their forces.

499
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,520
And inspire surrenders.

500
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,040
Even though we'll be working on abandon
streets miles behind the front line,

501
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,960
I guarantee you, whatever they put us,
it would not be safe.

502
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,560
This is a war zone.

503
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,600
It is likely that we'll encounter both
active Pods and peacekeepers.

504
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,920
You're considered high value
targets to the Capitol.

505
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,060
In the event of capture,
you'll be given a nightlock pill.

506
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,360
A poison that acts immediately.
Lieutenant Jackson do the honors.

507
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,880
I've already briefed
you on the Pods.

508
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,360
I remind you,
they are on every block.

509
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,000
Our unit has been given a HOLO.

510
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,660
A database that contain the
detailed map of the Capitol

511
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,400
and the list of every known Pod.

512
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,720
These Pods,

513
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,740
can trigger anything from bombs,
to traps, to mutts.

514
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,680
We cannot move without this device.

515
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,780
There's no guarantee that
our database is complete.

516
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,740
There can be new Pods
that we are not aware of.

517
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,820
Because we don't want the gamemakers
to know we have this Intel.

518
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,560
There's a self-destruct on it
You flip this switch.

519
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,040
You say, "nightlock" 3 times it blows itself 
in anything within a 10 foot radius.

520
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,580
Stay within our unit.

521
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,500
Even with the HOLO, it's likely
that new Pods have been set.

522
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,740
Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.

523
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,960
Ladies and gentlemen.

524
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,720
Welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.

525
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,840
I've never seen this place so empty.

526
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,380
Just keep your eyes open.

527
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,080
We got a Pod..

528
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,980
Stay cover.

529
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,480
Shoot through those 2 buildings.

530
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,020
Pollux.

531
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,840
Right here.

532
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,120
Castor.

533
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,980
Good.

534
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,500
When you're ready, Katniss.

535
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,360
Hold it.
Pod is tighter.

536
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,360
Okay.

537
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,360
All clear.

538
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,880
I don't think we can
get across this minefield.

539
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,640
Not without that HOLO.

540
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,620
We're not getting to get it
off him while he's awake

541
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,140
Make sure we're on the
same watch tonight.

542
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,200
Is that peacekeepers?

543
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,340
451 to Base. We got a truck
coming in from the south, over.

544
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,780
Copy that, over.

545
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,320
Stand down everyone, it's Bradly.

546
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,960
My name is Peeta Mellark. I'm with District 12.

547
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,100
My name is Peeta Mellark. I'm with District 12.

548
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,140
Okay, stop.

549
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,060
Hold up.
Everyone relax.

550
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
What are we doing?

551
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,700
Jackson, cuff him.

552
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,860
Soldier, this is just a precaution, until we
can get everything straighten out, yeah.

553
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,580
Yeah.

554
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,080
My name is Peeta Mellark, from District 12.

555
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,000
They want us to
add him to the propo.

556
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,560
To show he's on our side now.

557
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,940
We'll move forward a few blocks
tomorrow and shoot a new footage.

558
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,740
He's not in control of himself.

559
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,440
I say we schedule an around
the clock watch on him.

560
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,240
The Leegs till 1700.

561
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,380
Homes and Mitchell till 1900.

562
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,420
Give me a watch.

563
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,460
If it ever came down to it,
you think you can shoot him?

564
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,400
I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.
I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.

565
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,820
I'm not sure that kind of comment
recommends you for the job either, soldier.

566
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,960
Put her in the rotation.

567
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,160
He's gonna try to kill me.

568
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,400
Especially with all this going on.
It's going to set him off.

569
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,600
We'll keep him contained.

570
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,960
Why would Coin do this?

571
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,680
Here's all I know.

572
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,120
It was Peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.

573
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,520
She never liked you.

574
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,480
She doesn't like anybody
or anything she can't control.

575
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,740
So, she would put my life in danger?

576
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,620
She denied, but...

577
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,380
What?

578
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,300
One way or another this war
is gonna to come to an end.

579
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,240
They promised a free election.

580
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,280
Maybe she's starting
to see you as a threat.

581
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,460
Nobody would
think I'd be a leader.

582
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,600
But you'll throw support to someone,
would it be her?

583
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,000
If your immediate answer isn't yes,
then you're dangerous.

584
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,400
She doesn't need you as a rallying cry any more
these propos can be done without you.

585
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,040
Only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion.

586
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,280
Die.

587
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,980
That's not gonna happen
under my watch, Katniss.

588
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,100
I'm planning for you
to have a long life.

589
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,580
Why?
You don't owe me anything.

590
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,200
Because you've earned it.

591
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,580
We've been here before, you know?

592
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,960
What?

593
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,740
That look.

594
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,420
I've seen that look.

595
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,080
You're trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me.

596
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,520
I never wanted to kill you.

597
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,980
That's not what I'm doing.

598
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,220
I saw it with my own eyes.

599
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,160
In the first games.

600
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,760
In the first games, I thought you were
trying to help the Careers to kill me.

601
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,960
After that, I always saw you...

602
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,600
as an ally.

603
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,620
Friend.

604
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,440
Lover

605
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,620
Victor.

606
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,000
Fiancé.

607
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,580
Enemy

608
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,680
Target.

609
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,480
Mutt.
And now ally?

610
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,460
Yeah. I'll add it to the list of words
I use to try to figure you out.

611
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm sorry.

612
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,020
I just can't tell what's real
and what's made up anymore.

613
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,460
Then ask.
That's what Annie does.

614
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,060
Ask who?

615
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Us.
We're your new unit now.

616
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,160
Your favorite color is green.

617
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,040
Is that's real?

618
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,460
Yeah.
It's real.

619
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,780
Yours is orange.

620
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,040
Not... bright orange.

621
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,660
Soft like the sunset.

622
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,760
Thank you.

623
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,120
You're a painter.

624
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,720
You're a baker.

625
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,460
You always sleep
with the windows open.

626
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,960
You never take sugar in your tea.

627
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,340
You always double-knot your shoelaces.

628
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,440
You were right.

629
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,320
I can't do this.

630
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,700
I guess we're not leaving anymore.

631
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,280
We're not going anywhere
without that HOLO.

632
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,200
Listen up.

633
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,600
The mag's empty.

634
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,520
It's only for the propo.

635
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,280
Let's move.
We're heading 5 blocks north.

636
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,740
To the Citizens in the Capitol.
Our war is not with you.

637
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,980
To the Citizens in the Capitol.
Our war is not with you.

638
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,680
You will be a vital part of the
democracy that follows our victory.

639
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,340
Be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory.

640
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,780
- You got it.
- Okay.

641
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,040
Boggs.

642
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,980
This is a good spot.

643
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,380
Through there, in the courtyard.

644
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,420
Okay, let us clear it.

645
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,740
Got a Pod.

646
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,120
Split.
Take cover

647
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,840
Stay back.

648
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,160
All clear.
Gale, Holmes, with me.

649
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,140
Leegs, take the wings.

650
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,240
Everdeen, no!

651
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,440
- Boggs!
- Hold your position.

652
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,860
Boggs!

653
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,900
It's okay.

654
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,360
The HOLO.
The HOLO.

655
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,700
Unfit for command.

656
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,040
Transfer primary security clearance.

657
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,960
- Say your name.
- Katniss Everdeen.

658
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,980
- What did you just do?
- Katniss.

659
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,700
Don't trust them.

660
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,060
Kill Peeta if you have to.

661
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,620
Do what you came to do.

662
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,180
Boggs?

663
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,460
Come on.
Come on.

664
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,940
He's gone.
He's gone.

665
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,840
Go! Go! Go!
Now! Now!

666
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,160
- This way.
- Keep moving!

667
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,420
Katniss, go soldier!

668
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,260
Get to higher ground.
Now!

669
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,180
Finnick!

670
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,960
Peeta!

671
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,960
- Let's go!
- Oh God!

672
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,180
Come on.
Come on.

673
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,820
....

674
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,340
Come on.
Don't stop, let's go!

675
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,260
Come on! Come on!
We got to move!

676
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Get inside.

677
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,140
Everybody inside!
Go!

678
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,480
Upstairs! Go!

679
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,360
- Hurry up!
- Move!

680
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,140
- Go! Go!
- Move!

681
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,160
Keep moving.

682
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,800
Keep moving to the top.

683
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,500
Go!

684
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,240
Hey. Hey.
I got you. Shh...

685
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,340
It's slowing down.

686
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,960
Gamemakers are still putting
on quite a show.

687
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,940
- 451 to Base, over.
- Hey, we better move.

688
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,700
If peacekeepers didn't know
where we were, they do now.

689
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,180
Those surveillance cameras caught us.

690
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,680
451 to Base, come in.

691
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,700
This is a bad spot.
We need to move, now.

692
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,900
451 to Base, over.

693
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,660
I can't get a signal.

694
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,060
But I can get us back to Base.
Everdeen, give me the HOLO

695
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,260
Everdeen, what'd I just say?
The HOLO, come on, let's go.

696
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,480
Boggs gave it to me.

697
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,420
- What are you talking about?
- He did.

698
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
He transferred security clearance to her.

699
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,700
I saw him.

700
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,000
And why would he do that?

701
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,020
I'm on special orders from Coin.

702
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,580
To do what?

703
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,300
To assassinate President Snow.

704
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,920
I don't believe that
for one second.

705
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,280
As your new unit commander,

706
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,500
I order you to transfer
security clearance to me. Now.

707
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,960
I can't do that.

708
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
Let's not lose our heads here.

709
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,640
I'm not asking it again, Everdeen.

710
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,940
Give me that HOLO.

711
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,080
She's telling the truth.

712
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,580
Plutarch wants it televised.

713
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,820
He thinks if we can film
the Mockingjay assassinating Snow,

714
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,400
it will make the Capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high.

715
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,120
While we're arguing, there's a hundred
peacekeepers on their way here.

716
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,540
Boggs promised me that when the
time came you would help me.

717
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,320
Alright, soldier.

718
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,220
The HOLO is yours.

719
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,620
I don't think we're going to leave
any footprints. We should move, now.

720
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,980
Most cameras outside should be
covered up by the oil.

721
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,180
She can't move forward like this.
Her leg's too bad.

722
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,320
We have to evacuate her.

723
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,240
I'm sorry.

724
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,500
I'll stay with her.

725
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,680
As soon as we make contact,

726
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,340
we will send somebody back.
I promise you.

727
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,620
Alright, everybody, move out.

728
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,180
- Let's get him up.
- Go.

729
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,320
Can you walk?

730
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,400
Come on this way.

731
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,260
Get these curtains closed.

732
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,140
It's the Leegs.

733
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,220
Good afternoon,
I'm Caesar Flickerman.

734
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,880
Hear about continuing coverage
of the defense of the Capitol.

735
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,660
Today, as our peacekeepers
valiantly hold off the rebels,

736
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,400
our story takes a surprising twist.

737
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,220
Katniss Everdeen.
Our once favourite daughter,

738
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,820
has infiltrated the city
with some of the Victors.

739
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,100
Who's names are all too familiar.

740
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,420
Finnick Odair
and Peeta Mellark.

741
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,220
Clearly, some alliances don't last forever.

742
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,080
Take a look at what happened
just a moment ago.

743
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,360
When our peacekeepers
cornered Katniss Everdeen

744
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,760
and her band of foolish rebels.

745
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,340
Whatever arrogance brought this
treacherous girl back to us.

746
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,300
You're about to witness a great
victory, not only to the Capitol,

747
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,000
but for Panem.

748
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,400
So, there you have it.

749
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,260
Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire.

750
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,980
A girl who inspired so much violence.

751
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,840
Seems to have met
a violent end herself.

752
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,600
Stay tuned for more information.
Caesar Flickerman, thank you.

753
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,100
So, now that we're dead,
what are we gonna to do?

754
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,580
Isn't it obvious?

755
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,560
The next move is to kill me.

756
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,020
I murdered one of
our squad members.

757
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,880
Katniss is right.

758
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,120
I'm a mutt.

759
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,240
It's only a matter of time
before I snapped again.

760
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,720
I'm not in control.

761
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,200
I need a nightlock pill.

762
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,180
So, I can die when I need to.

763
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,940
When it gets to that point
I'll kill you myself.

764
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,620
I don't think I ever really
understood the Capitol until now.

765
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,740
You eat like this you could believe anything.

766
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,800
So, Katniss Everdeen.

767
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,620
A poor unstable girl with nothing but
a small talent with a bow and arrow,

768
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,620
is dead.

769
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,740
Not a thinker.
Not a leader.

770
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,080
Simply a face
plucked for the masses.

771
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,680
Was she valuable?
She was extremely valuable to your rebellion.

772
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,380
Because you have no vision,
no true leader among you.

773
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,020
You call themselves an alliance,

774
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,920
but we saw what that means.

775
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,400
Your soldiers are at
each other's throats.

776
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,780
Good night. Panem

777
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,380
For those of you
who don't know me,

778
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,840
please allow me to introduce myself.

779
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,620
I am President Alma Coin,

780
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,660
leader of the rebellion.

781
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,320
I've interrupted a broadcast
from your president

782
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:53,260
in which he attempted to defame
a brave young woman.

783
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,580
A face, picked from the masses,
he called her.

784
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,240
- Plucked.
- As if a leader...

785
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,420
A true leader,
could be anything else.

786
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,040
I had the privilege of knowing

787
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,700
a small town girl from
the scene in District 12,

788
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,240
who survived the Hunger Games
and the Quarter Quell.

789
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:20,360
And rose up and turned a nation
of slaves into an army.

790
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:26,040
Dead or alive. Katniss Everdeen
will remain the face of this revolution.

791
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,620
She will not have
died for nothing.

792
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,980
I had no idea
I meant so much to her.

793
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,320
Her vision and ours
will be realised.

794
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,820
A free Panem.

795
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,200
With self-determination for all.

796
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,620
And in her memory, we will all
find strength to rid Panem

797
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,140
of it's oppressors. Thank you,

798
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,080
and be safe.

799
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,840
- Snow is in his mansion.
- Where is that?

800
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,520
That's us.

801
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,840
That's the city circle.

802
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,820
It's at least
70, 75 blocks north.

803
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,640
- 75 blocks?
- Uh huh.

804
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,780
Nobody knows we're alive.
This is our chance.

805
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,740
These buildings, do these
look over Snow's garden?

806
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,240
- I...
- They do.

807
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,420
If he goes outside at all,
I can get a clear shot.

808
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,400
We are getting ahead
of ourselves here.

809
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,960
Whether they're looking for us
or not, we're pinned down.

810
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,880
Hit that button,
scan for Pods.

811
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,720
Just about every 10 steps.

812
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,140
Yeah, that doesn't even
show the new ones.

813
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,520
So, we can't go anywhere
in the streets.

814
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,640
And the red tops suggest as that.

815
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,660
There might be another way.

816
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,380
My brother knows these
tunnels really well.

817
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,820
He works sanitation down here.

818
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,640
Or after they made him an Avox.

819
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,420
Hey.
Hey.

820
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,040
You're going to be okay?
Look at me.

821
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,860
Look at me.

822
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,800
We're going to get through this,
I promise.

823
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,000
It take us 5 years to
buy his way out of here.

824
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,200
He didn't see the sun once.

825
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,360
We're too expose here.

826
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,540
Sir.
Shall I call you a doctor?

827
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:55,840
- What did you say?
- Shall I call for your a doctor?

828
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,820
I hope you waking me for
something more urgent than

829
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,560
an old man's health.

830
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,740
They survived.
I don't know how.

831
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,800
We picked them up
on a surveillance cam.

832
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:10,380
Let me see.
I-I need to see for myself.

833
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,160
It's her.

834
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,700
It is her.

835
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,540
Her arena has moved underground.

836
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,460
Looks clear.

837
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,800
Everybody, okay?

838
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,200
Yeah.

839
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,460
Alright, everybody.
Let's stop here for a bit

840
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,580
and get some rest, yeah?

841
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,960
I'll take first watch.

842
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,340
Hey, Peeta,
you'll stuck in there.

843
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,320
Alright, settle in, everybody.

844
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,780
Katniss, your watch.

845
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,360
You know, the capital, they used
tracker jacker venom on me.

846
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,620
That's what the doctors on 13 said.
You were stung once too.

847
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,440
Real or not real?

848
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,580
Real.

849
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:18,060
When they used the venom on me,
they would show me pictures of my life.

850
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,500
But some weren't real.
They changed them.

851
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,640
At first, they all-they all
blurred together, but now...

852
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,520
now I can sort them out a little.

853
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,840
Like the... little ones that they changed,
they have this...

854
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,520
this choir,
it's like they're

855
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,240
They are shiny,
they've been glossed over.

856
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,340
You should get some rest.

857
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:57,380
You're still trying to protect me,
real or not real?

858
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,840
Real.

859
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,840
That's what you and I do.

860
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,620
Keep each other alive.

861
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,200
Katniss.

862
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,880
Katniss.

863
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,480
What is that?

864
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,220
We got to go.
We got to get out of here now.

865
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,000
Mutts.
They release mutts.

866
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,440
Pollux, what's is the fastest way out?

867
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,260
Come on, go.
Go!

868
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,080
- Move! Move! Move! Move!
- Come on! Come on! Come on!

869
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,740
Pollux, lead us out of here!

870
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,740
Come on.

871
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,600
Castor!

872
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,180
Castor!

873
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,560
Fall back!

874
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,100
Move.

875
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,200
Katniss. come on!
Move!

876
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,260
Katniss.

877
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,180
Go!
Go, go, go...!

878
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,300
Go, go, go!

879
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,160
Katniss!

880
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,680
- Aww!
- Finnick!

881
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,300
Finnick!

882
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,580
GAWWWWW !!!

883
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,800
- KATNISS !!
- Nightlock.

884
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,860
- AAWWWW!!!
- Nightlock.

885
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,960
Nightlock.

886
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,400
AWWWW !!!

887
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,320
Come on. Come on!
Come on. Come on!

888
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,800
Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

889
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,180
Go!
Go!

890
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,220
Keep going.
Keep going!

891
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,440
Peeta, come on.

892
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,300
Peeta!

893
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,540
- Peeta, we have to get going!
- I'm a mutt!

894
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,400
We have to get going.
Yes, you can.

895
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,300
Leave me. I'm a mutt!

896
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,940
Look at me!
Look at me.

897
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,120
Stay with me.

898
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,740
Always.

899
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,200
Come on.

900
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,980
I know where we are.

901
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,840
I know a place.
Up those stairs.

902
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,920
Keep going.

903
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,240
Someone's coming.

904
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,480
Shut the door.
Shut the door.

905
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,040
No, Katniss, she isn't in the way.
It's okay.

906
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,660
Tigris, you remember me?
I'm with Plutarch's Underground.

907
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,080
We need your help.

908
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,000
Clear!

909
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,380
I know you.

910
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,860
You're a stylist in the Games.

911
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:08,520
Until Snow decided
I wasn't pretty enough anymore.

912
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,220
I'm here to kill him.

913
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,880
Gales gonna need stitches.

914
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,740
I made it up.

915
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,920
All of it.

916
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,140
There is no
special mission from Coin.

917
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,600
It's only my plan.

918
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,740
Everyone that's dead,
is dead because of me. I...

919
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,260
I lied

920
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,720
We know.
We all knew.

921
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,480
- Soldiers from 13...
- They need to...

922
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:39,260
Do you really believe that Jackson
thought you had orders from Coin?

923
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,500
She trusted Boggs, so he
clearly wanted you to go on.

924
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,900
I never meant for this to happen.

925
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,240
I failed them.

926
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,500
I killed-I killed them.
I killed Finnick.

927
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,600
I'm sorry, Pollux.

928
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,660
I'm so sorry.

929
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,700
Glimmer.

930
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,700
Marvel.

931
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,200
Mags.

932
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,980
Clove.

933
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,460
Wiress.

934
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,020
Rue.

935
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,040
What do all those deaths mean?

936
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,380
They mean that our lives
were never ours.

937
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:37,060
There was no real life,
because we didn't have any choice.

938
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,260
Our lives, belong to Snow
and our deaths do too.

939
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,480
But if you kill him, Katniss.

940
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,080
If you end all of this...

941
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,280
All those deaths,
they mean something.

942
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,760
Cinna.

943
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,420
Boggs.

944
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,220
Castor.

945
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,300
Jackson.
Finnick.

946
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,320
They chose this.

947
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,100
They chose you.

948
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,240
You should keep this clean,
otherwise it will get infected.

949
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,380
You should cuff me.

950
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,300
It's not safe with me yet.

951
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,280
I have moments when I'm here...

952
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,660
My memories are getting better,
but...

953
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,780
Other times, it's like I'm sleepwalking.

954
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,320
You should cuff me.

955
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,640
Thanks, for the water.

956
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,720
I can't sleep.

957
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,880
Yeah, I haven't slept
in days either.

958
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:37,140
I should have volunteered to
take your place in the first Games.

959
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,380
Well, you couldn't have.

960
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,120
And she-she'd never have forgiven you.

961
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,780
She needs you to be there and take care 
of her family and you did.

962
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,780
She can't lose you.

963
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,400
She really loves you.

964
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,520
The way she kissed you
in the Quarter Quell.

965
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,260
She never kissed me like that.

966
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,980
You know it's part of the show, Gale.

967
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,460
No, you won her over.

968
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,140
You gave up everything for her.

969
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,340
It's not going to be
an issue much longer.

970
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:21,340
I doubt all 3 of us are gonna
make it out of this.

971
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,420
And if we do, then...

972
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,740
It's her problem who to choose, right?

973
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,080
Yeah.

974
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,060
Well, I do know that Katniss will pick
whoever she can't survive without.

975
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,100
Mortar shells.
It's not ours.

976
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,700
Peacekeepers must be shelling
the rebels outside the city.

977
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,760
That's not outside the city.

978
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,640
Sun's coming up.

979
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,480
There's some small arms fire.
Could be Paylor maybe Lyme.

980
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:58,920
The rebels are close.

981
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,720
This is it.

982
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:16,040
To all Capitol citizens more than
half a mile outside the city circle.

983
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,900
I'm announcing a mandatory evacuation.

984
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:24,840
Come to the mansion.
I'm promising you shelter and sanctuary.

985
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:28,880
All refugees, come to my home

986
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,860
There, you will be provided with food,

987
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,660
medicine, safety for your children.

988
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:41,180
And you will have my solemn oath
to protect you until my dying breath.

989
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,740
You should hurry up
with that last part.

990
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,020
Our enemies are not like us.
They do not share our values.

991
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:51,480
They have never known
our comfort and our sophistication.

992
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,020
And they despise us for it.
Make no mistake.

993
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,260
They are not coming
to liberate us.

994
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,180
They are coming to
destroy our way of life.

995
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,860
They are coming to bury us.

996
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,660
Is he still in the mansion?

997
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,180
Peeta?

998
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,620
Yeah.
I recognize the room.

999
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:18,040
Where's that?

1000
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,240
About 5 blocks away.

1001
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,080
We are right here,
off the avenues.

1002
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,960
- The mansion is here
- What about the Pods?

1003
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,060
Well, they'd probably deactivate the
Pods around here for the resident safety.

1004
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,920
That could work.

1005
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,320
I can get close enough.

1006
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,120
Every peacekeeper is
going to be waiting.

1007
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,780
Next to our faces
on every billboard.

1008
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,620
Snow's offering shelter
to all the refugees.

1009
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,020
Head straight north.

1010
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,060
There's going to be
thousands of refugees,

1011
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,260
just get into that stream
and don't look up.

1012
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:57,880
We got one shot.

1013
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,160
Let's make it count.

1014
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,060
Good luck, Katniss.

1015
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,340
Thank you.

1016
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,860
Pollux.

1017
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,180
Tigris, thank you for
everything you've done.

1018
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,620
Katniss, let me come with you, okay?

1019
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,880
- I can be a good distraction, they didn't know my face
- No.

1020
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,940
No, I'm not losing you again.

1021
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:34,920
You'll be safer with us.

1022
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:38,180
What if peacemakers are searching
the houses, and if he's captured...

1023
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,880
Then, give me a nightlock pill, okay.
I'm not going back.

1024
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,920
Stay alive.

1025
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,520
If I see you again, it's going
to be a different world.

1026
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,100
Are you ready, Katniss?

1027
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,140
Let's go.

1028
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,900
By order of President Snow,

1029
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,820
all residents must proceed
to the presidential estate.

1030
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:02,680
Please continue to move forward
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1031
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:09,380
Additional food, medicine and clothing
will be provided upon arrival.

1032
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,160
By order of President Snow,

1033
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,660
all residents must proceed
to the presidential estate.

1034
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:21,540
Please continue to move forward
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1035
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:28,740
Additional food, medicine and clothing
will be provided upon arrival.

1036
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:32,080
By order of President Snow,

1037
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,080
all residents must proceed
to the presidential estate.

1038
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:40,940
Please continue to move forward
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1039
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:47,420
Additional food, medicine and clothing
will be provided upon arrival.

1040
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,760
It's the Rebels!

1041
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,940
Don't move!

1042
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,840
Rebels!

1043
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,680
Mama!
Mama!

1044
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,340
Come on!

1045
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,000
Come on.

1046
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,820
Shoot me!

1047
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,580
Shoot me!

1048
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:36,420
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1049
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:39,760
The gates will open momentarily.

1050
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:43,200
The children will be received first.

1051
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:49,580
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1052
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:52,900
The gates will open momentarily.

1053
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,620
The children will be received first.

1054
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:02,200
Stay calm.
Bring your children forward.

1055
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,880
The gates will open momentarily.

1056
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:09,140
The children will be received first.

1057
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,440
It's the Capitol.

1058
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,320
Medic!

1059
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:27,180
Medic!

1060
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,040
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

1061
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,700
Medics coming in.

1062
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,520
Bring a stretcher!

1063
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,240
Prim.

1064
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,740
Primrose.

1065
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,040
Prim!

1066
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,860
Hey.
I need you to lie back.

1067
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,860
You're okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

1068
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,520
The fight was over after that Capitol dropped
those bombs at the feet of the palace.

1069
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,120
The rebels walked right in.

1070
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:50,180
Don't, Katniss.
The only one's working.

1071
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,200
Everybody felt it.

1072
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:59,420
Peacekeepers. Palace Guards.
They had kids in there too.

1073
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:01,760
It was...

1074
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:09,420
It was over after that.

1075
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,380
Mom.

1076
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,700
I remember the first
time I brought you here.

1077
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,740
And here we are.

1078
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,020
I've brought all your things.

1079
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:58,360
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.

1080
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,620
Sorry, ma'am.
I can't let you pass.

1081
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,220
Let her in.

1082
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,300
On my authority.

1083
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,200
She has a right to
anything behind that door.

1084
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,960
That's a nice one.

1085
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:03,240
The colors are lovely, of course,

1086
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:07,300
but nothing says perfection like white.

1087
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,960
I was hoping you'd
find your way here.

1088
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:15,340
There are so many things
we should discuss.

1089
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:22,360
But I have a feeling your
visit will be brief. So,

1090
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,960
first things first.

1091
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:37,980
I wanted to tell you
how very sorry I am about your sister.

1092
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:42,220
So wasteful, so unnecessary.

1093
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:45,940
Anyone could see the game
was over by that point.

1094
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,980
In fact, I was just about to issue an official
surrender when they released those parachutes.

1095
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,120
You released those parachutes.

1096
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,680
You really think I gave the order?

1097
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,760
We both know
I'm not above killing children,

1098
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,220
but I'm not wasteful.

1099
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,740
I take life for
specific reasons.

1100
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:09,200
And there was no reason for me to
destroy a pen full of Capitol children.

1101
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:10,760
None at all.

1102
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:21,900
I must concede it was a
masterful move on Coin's part.

1103
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:28,380
The idea that I was bombing our own
helpless children to hold back the Rebels.

1104
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,980
It turned the last of
my guards against me.

1105
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:36,800
There was no resistance left inside
the Capitol or the mansion.

1106
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:40,580
Did you know it aired live?

1107
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:47,160
There's a...
particular savvy in that, isn't there?

1108
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:54,020
I'm sure he wasn't gunning
for your sister, but...

1109
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:58,080
These things happen in war.

1110
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:04,700
My failure was being so slow
to grasp Coin's plan.

1111
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,520
She let the Capitol and the
districts destroy one another,

1112
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:13,920
and she step in to take power
over Thirteen arsenal.

1113
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,620
But make no mistake.

1114
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:20,140
She intends to take
my place now.

1115
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,020
But, I've been watching you.

1116
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:28,220
And you watching me.

1117
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:33,360
I'm afraid we have both
been played for fools.

1118
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,660
I don't believe you

1119
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,840
Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen.

1120
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:47,120
I thought we had agreed
never to lie to each other.

1121
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,520
President Coin ask for you.

1122
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:08,880
You never came to see me.

1123
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:15,260
- I wanted to.
- Was it ours?

1124
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,000
The bomb?

1125
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,340
The delayed explosion.

1126
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,920
The trap.

1127
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:29,200
To draw more people in.

1128
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,540
Was that you?

1129
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,840
I don't know.

1130
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,160
All I know is,

1131
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:43,820
I'm suppose to take
care of your family.

1132
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,000
And I'm sorry I couldn't.

1133
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,560
You can't protect
anyone in an Arena.

1134
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,040
Goodbye, Gale.

1135
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:33,080
What's this?

1136
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:36,700
The remaining Victors.
Won't you join us?

1137
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,760
I've invited you all here for
several reasons, but first...

1138
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,080
I have an announcement.

1139
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,080
I am taking the burden

1140
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:00,340
and the honor of declaring
myself interim President of Panem.

1141
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,220
Interim?

1142
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:06,440
Exactly how long
is that interim?

1143
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:09,080
We have no way
of knowing for certain.

1144
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,220
But, it's clear that people
are far too emotional

1145
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:14,420
right now to make a
rational decision.

1146
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,060
We'll plan an election
when the time is right.

1147
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:22,440
But I've called you here
for a far more important vote.

1148
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,920
A symbolic vote.

1149
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:28,940
This afternoon we will execute Snow.

1150
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:32,580
Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.

1151
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:37,640
Capitol officials, peacekeepers,
torturers, gamemakers.

1152
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,760
But the danger is,
once we begin

1153
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:42,880
the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.

1154
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:47,020
Thirst for blood is a
difficult urge to satisfy.

1155
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:52,160
So...
I offer an alternative plan.

1156
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:56,460
A majority of four may approve it.
No one may abstain.

1157
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,920
The proposal is this.

1158
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:04,300
In lieu of these
barbaric executions,

1159
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,740
we hold a symbolic Hunger Games.

1160
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:23,820
You want to have another Hunger Games
with the Capitol's children?

1161
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,300
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.

1162
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,960
Is this Plutarch's idea?

1163
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:33,100
It was mine.

1164
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:39,700
It balances the need for revenge
with the least loss of human life.

1165
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,480
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

1166
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,860
No, obviously not.
This is crazy.

1167
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:48,900
No, I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.

1168
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:49,900
I say, yes.

1169
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,560
So do I.
Let them have a taste of it.

1170
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,980
You guys, this way of thinking is
what started these uprisings.

1171
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,040
I vote no, with Peeta.

1172
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:01,060
So would Finnick,
if he were here.

1173
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,660
Well, he's not,
because Snow killed him.

1174
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:04,820
No.

1175
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,540
We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.

1176
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,620
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.

1177
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,480
I get to kill Snow.

1178
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,900
I expected no less of you.

1179
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,620
Then I vote yes...

1180
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,440
for Prim.

1181
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,600
Haymitch.

1182
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,960
I'm with the Mockingjay.

1183
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,300
That carries the vote.
Excellent.

1184
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:02,240
I'll announce the games tonight,
after the execution.

1185
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,500
Bound to be
quite the show.

1186
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,000
Oh, you look lovely, as ever.

1187
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,920
Just beautiful.

1188
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:23,520
Finishing touches.

1189
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:50,540
Welcome to the new Panem.

1190
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:54,960
Today, on the avenue of the tributes.

1191
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:59,320
All of Panem,
a free Panem

1192
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:03,580
will watch more
than a mere spectacle.

1193
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:10,680
We are gathered to witness
a historic moment of justice.

1194
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,400
Today, the greatest friend of the revolution,

1195
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:20,300
will fire the shot
to end all wars.

1196
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:25,440
May her arrow signify
the end of tyranny

1197
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,900
and the beginning
of a new era.

1198
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:44,360
Mockingjay, may your aim be
as true as your heart is pure.

1199
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:30,960
Eh-ha-ha...
Ha ha ha...

1200
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,560
No.

1201
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:40,060
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

1202
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:45,260
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

1203
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,620
Kill him!

1204
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:05,360
I'll say this for you, Katniss.
You don't disappoint.

1205
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,980
Well, Plutarch gave
me a letter for you.

1206
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:11,260
I don't want it.

1207
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,160
You never make it easy, do you?

1208
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:19,120
Okay.
I'll read it for you.

1209
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:24,280
Katniss, maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,

1210
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:26,280
but once again
I was not.

1211
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,900
You're exactly who
I believe you were.

1212
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:33,680
I wish I could give you a proper good bye
but with both Coin and Snow dead,

1213
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:38,840
the fate of the country will be decided
tonight and I can't be seen at your side.

1214
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:42,760
Tonight, the 12 district leaders
will call for a free election.

1215
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:47,600
There's no doubt that Paylor will carry,
she's become the voice of reason.

1216
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:51,000
I'm sorry so much
burden fell on you.

1217
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,780
I know you'll never escape it.

1218
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,240
But if I had to put
you through it again

1219
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:59,380
for this outcome.
I would.

1220
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,980
The war is over.

1221
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,560
We're in that sweet period
where everyone agrees

1222
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:08,000
not to repeat the recent horrors.

1223
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:11,480
Of course, we are
fickle stupid beings

1224
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:15,600
with poor memories and a
great gift for self-destruction.

1225
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,200
Although who knows?
Maybe this time we'll learn.

1226
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:24,300
I've secured you a ride
out of the capital.

1227
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,200
It's better for you
to be out of sight.

1228
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:29,880
And when the time is right,
Commander Paylor will pardon you.

1229
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:32,780
The country will find it's peace.

1230
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:37,220
And I hope you can find yours.
Plutarch.

1231
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:41,740
What now?

1232
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,800
Home.
We go home.

1233
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:55,160
I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.

1234
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:04,260
It's your job to take care
of yourself now, Katniss.

1235
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:10,060
Promise me you'll find it.

1236
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:12,440
Find what?

1237
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,080
The life of a Victor.

1238
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,240
- Goodbye Effie.
- Goodbye, my girl.

1239
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:27,140
Effie don't be a stranger.

1240
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:34,460
- Take care of her.
- I will.

1241
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,640
She's gone.

1242
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:16,720
Get out.

1243
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,380
Get out!

1244
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,880
Prim is gone!
Prim is gone!

1245
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,940
She's dead and
she's not coming back!

1246
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:30,120
Get out!
Get out!

1247
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:05,060
Peeta.

1248
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:09,880
Hey.

1249
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,260
You came home.

1250
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,880
Yeah.

1251
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:25,060
I found these...
off by the edge of the forest.

1252
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:30,600
It's Primrose.

1253
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,860
I'm so sorry, Katniss.

1254
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:55,640
You'll be happy to hear
that Katniss' mother

1255
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:58,200
has been training new medical
units in the Capitol.

1256
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:01,020
Gale has been promoted
to a Captain in District 2

1257
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:03,020
to help keep order and security.

1258
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,560
And I'm loving every moment
with my son.

1259
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:08,440
He reminds me everyday
of his father.

1260
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:12,200
We've all suffer so much.
But we owe it to their memories

1261
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:15,880
and to our children to do
our best with these lives.

1262
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:19,000
I hope you're both
finding some peace.

1263
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:20,740
Annie.

1264
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:33,480
I solemnly swear
to the best of my ability

1265
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:38,920
to preserve, protect and uphold
the rights of every citizen at Panem.

1266
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:41,740
There's Plutarch,
brand know it all.

1267
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:46,320
And they say,
no one ever wins the games.

1268
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:06,760
You love me.

1269
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:10,340
Real or not real?

1270
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:13,940
Real.

1271
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:11,200
Did you have a nightmare?

1272
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:15,540
I have nightmares too.

1273
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:23,740
Someday, I'll explain it to you.

1274
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:26,880
Why they came.

1275
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,360
Why they won't ever go away.

1276
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:40,240
But I'll tell you
how I survived it.

1277
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:44,100
I'll make a list in my head,

1278
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,360
for all the good things
