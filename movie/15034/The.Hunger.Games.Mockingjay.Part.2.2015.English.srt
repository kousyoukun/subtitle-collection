1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,076
Okay.

2
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,613
Okay, I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,715
I know it's a little tender.

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,418
Hmm.

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,091
Okay, let's try
your voice now.

6
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,229
"My name is katniss everdeen.
I'm from district 12."

7
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,169
My...

8
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,237
Okay, take your time.

9
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,173
Still got a lot of swelling
in your vocal chords.

10
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,342
My

11
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,580
name is

12
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,517
katniss everdeen.

13
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,257
I want...

14
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,260
I want to talk to him.

15
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,797
He needs time.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,635
But, um, we're trying
somethin' new today.

17
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,605
He's been calmer
with the doctors,

18
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,741
but they're strangers
to him.

19
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,343
So we're gonna
test his response

20
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,278
on someone
he remembers from home.

21
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,682
Someone he trusts.

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,462
Send her in.

23
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,509
 Hey.

24
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,443
 Prim.

25
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,745
 How you feelin'?
She's too close.

26
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,481
- Mmm, it's okay.
- How'd you get here?

27
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,284
 We live in district 13 now.

28
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,386
It's a real place.
Stories are true.

29
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,555
You were rescued.

30
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,191
My family hasn't come
to see me.

31
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,198
There was an attack on 12.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,932
Yes.

33
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,868
My family?

34
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,206
The bakery didn't survive.

35
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,957
It's katniss.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,561
It's because of katniss.

37
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:16,728
Wasn't because of her.

38
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,197
She tell you to say that?

39
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,964
She didn't tell me anything.

40
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,199
She's a liar, prim.

41
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,701
 It's a trick.

42
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,504
Peeta, what you're saying
isn't real.

43
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,344
She sent you here
to talk to me.

44
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,712
She knows you're here now.
It's okay.

45
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,747
She knows...
You can't trust her!

46
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,382
She's a monster!

47
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,885
She's a mutt that the capitol
created to destroy us!

48
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,787
Get her outta there.
 Do you understand me?

49
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,789
You have to kill her, prim!

50
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,390
 You have to kill her!

51
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,260
Katniss?
 She's a mutt!

52
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,997
This is just
a conditioned response.

53
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,865
 Kill her!
It's not him.

54
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,367
 She's a monster!
 She's a mutt!

55
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,535
No, it's not him.

56
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,469
 She's a mutt!

57
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,448
There's not enough
manpower coming in from 4.

58
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,616
I don't think
that's a problem.

59
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,351
Please, come in.

60
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,286
With any kind
of manpower, if we...

61
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,821
Will you excuse us
for just a moment?

62
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,622
Of course.

63
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,958
Have a seat.

64
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,364
I'm glad you're
feeling better.

65
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,040
Snow has to pay
for what he's done.

66
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,309
I wanna help the rebels
in any way I can.

67
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,443
It's hard to see
peeta this way.

68
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,578
That's not peeta.

69
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,515
Send me to the capitol.
I'll do anything.

70
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,317
I can't.

71
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,526
I can't send you there.

72
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,895
We can't get into the capitol
until we control district 2.

73
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,463
Then send me to 2.

74
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,700
You want me to
fire up our troops?

75
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,335
Call out to the loyalists?
You've seen what I can do.

76
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,339
Yes, I have.

77
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,583
I saw peeta before we left.

78
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,819
And what did you think?

79
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,421
Something selfish.

80
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,461
That you don't have to be
jealous of him anymore.

81
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,629
No.

82
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,936
I don't stand a chance
if he doesn't get better.

83
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,139
You'll never let him go.

84
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,430
What's goin' on
in your head?

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,601
I don't know.

86
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,903
That's like kissing someone
who's drunk.

87
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,072
Doesn't count.

88
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,450
 Thirty minutes
 until touchdown.

89
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,651
 Prepare for landing.

90
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,057
Wrap it up.
Cut the chatter. Let's go.

91
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,462
This is another version
of booby-trapping a resource.

92
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,763
Right, I see.
This one's
designed to blind.

93
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,899
Smoke clings to the eyes.

94
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,201
That's an application
of the "hummingbird trap."

95
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,203
You scare people
so they flee in this direction

96
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,505
into what they think
is a safe haven.

97
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,574
Two-tiered explosion.

98
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,909
You allow people
enough time to rush in,
help the wounded, then...

99
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:24,976
A second bomb.

100
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,045
Right.

101
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,648
Second one goes off here.

102
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,149
I guess there are
no rules anymore about

103
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,184
what a person can do
to another person.

104
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,221
I don't think snow used
any rulebook

105
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,056
when he hijacked peeta.

106
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,646
Welcome to district 2.
I'm corporal homes.

107
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,647
You follow me, please.

108
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,791
Don't worry.

109
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,960
It's just how the loyalists
say "good morning."

110
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,761
President coin,
we're indebted to you

111
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,129
for the reinforcements
and the mockingjay.

112
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,967
But I'm not sure that
anyone outside of 2

113
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,101
knows what
we've been up against.

114
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,537
This is the nut.

115
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,074
The capitol's headquarters
for all offensive operations.

116
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,643
It's manned by both military
and civilian personnel

117
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,744
from district 2.

118
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,246
As you can see,

119
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,947
the fortress lies
so far beneath

120
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,916
the bedrock, it's untouchable.

121
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,952
Yesterday, we attempted
to take
the northeastern gate.

122
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,220
The enemy countered
from higher up

123
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,055
and we were forced
to pull back.

124
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,925
We took heavy losses.

125
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:46,925
Could we create a decoy?

126
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,661
Send troops towards one gate,

127
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,830
launch a staggered attack
on another.

128
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,199
Whose troops do you propose
as a decoy, commander?

129
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,235
 We have the mockingjay.
 Don't underestimate her.

130
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,671
 We could use her
 to erode support.

131
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,240
 She may be able to sway
 some of the loyalists.

132
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,777
You've been underground
a long time, madam coin.

133
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,679
This isn't like
the rest of panem.

134
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,981
Support for the capitol
runs deep here.

135
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,850
 Then there is
 no sacrifice too great.

136
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,689
 We need to control the arsenal
 inside that fortress.

137
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,991
 Even with every district
 in this alliance,

138
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,693
 we are outgunned.

139
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,061
I won't commit my people
to a ground assault

140
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,896
just to pillage weapons.

141
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,865
 Commander paylor,
 your people have suffered

142
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:26,865
 more than just about
 anyone else

143
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,067
 at the hands of the capitol.

144
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,635
Which is why I won't
condone a mass suicide.

145
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,003
 If we don't take
 district 2,

146
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,605
 we won't get into
 the capitol.

147
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,007
Would it be enough
to disable the fortress

148
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:36,808
instead of taking it?

149
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,644
What do you
have in mind?

150
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,014
You think of it
like a wolf den.

151
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,115
You're not gonna
fight your way in,

152
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,951
so you've got two choices.

153
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,720
You trap the wolves inside,
or you flush 'em out.

154
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,055
If we can't attack
straight on,

155
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:50,055
then couldn't we use
our hovercraft

156
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,158
to strike around it?
We'll use the mountains.

157
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,326
We'll hit weak spots
in the peaks.

158
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,860
We could design the bomb
targets in sequence

159
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:56,962
using seismic data.

160
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,330
Trigger avalanches.

161
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,031
Block all exits,
cut off their supplies.

162
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,666
You make it impossible

163
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,601
for them to launch
their hovercraft.

164
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,234
Bury them alive.

165
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,038
 We'd forfeit any chance
 to control the weapons.

166
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,340
Yes, but we'd face
a weakened capitol.

167
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,741
There's civilians in there.

168
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,678
They should be given
a chance to surrender.

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,914
Could use one of the supply
tunnels for the evacuees.

170
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,249
It's a luxury
we weren't given
when they firebombed 12.

171
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,652
There's gotta be
a better way.

172
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,188
 I suggest we try
 the avalanche,

173
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,956
 but leave
 the train tunnel alone.

174
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,958
 Civilians can escape
 into the square,

175
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,827
 where our armies will be
 waiting for their surrender.

176
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,196
We should have
every available medic
standing by.

177
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,131
And if they won't surrender?

178
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,701
 Then we will need a compelling
 voice to persuade them.

179
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,654
 Red flag, this is blue leader.

180
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,322
 Form up on Charlie tango,
 1,500 meters out.

181
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:00,692
 Weapons system, check.

182
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:00,692
 Commencing
 an attack formation.

183
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:04,863
 Roger that.
 All bombers are outbound.

184
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,700
What's the difference,
katniss?

185
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,235
Crushing the enemy in a mine

186
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,736
or blowin' them outta the sky
with one of beetee's arrows.

187
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,705
It's the same thing.

188
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,740
We were under attack
in district 8.

189
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,810
And that hovercraft
wasn't filled with civilians.

190
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,945
Doesn't matter.

191
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,213
Even if those civilians
are just moppin' floors,

192
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,283
they're helping the enemy.

193
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,252
And if they have to die,
i can live with that.

194
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,787
 Two thousand meters out.

195
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,321
No one who supports
the capitol is innocent.

196
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,757
With that kinda thinking,
you can kill whoever you want.

197
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,225
You can send kids off
to the hunger games

198
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,760
to keep the districts in line.

199
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,995
 Bombs away.

200
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,333
It's war, katniss.

201
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,171
Sometimes killing
isn't personal.

202
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,708
Figured if anyone knew that,
it was you.

203
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,844
I, of all people, know
that it's always personal.

204
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,048
Don't worry, katniss,
there'll be survivors.

205
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,852
Let's focus on
what it is you gotta say.

206
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,320
Now, plutarch wrote
a speech for you...

207
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,888
I'm not saying that.

208
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,523
Okay. Didn't think so.
Let's, uh...

209
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,527
But just remember,
you're talking to everybody.

210
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,996
Not just the rebels,
but the capitol,

211
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,965
the survivors in 2.

212
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,200
We want them
to lay down their arms.

213
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,835
So you might wanna experiment

214
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,203
with a little
sensitivity, warmth.

215
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,373
Make it quick,
you're exposed.

216
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,267
This is katniss everdeen,

217
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,802
speaking to all
of the loyalists

218
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,969
from the heart of district 2.

219
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,337
Survivors! Inbound!

220
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,039
Ready!
Ready! Guns up!

221
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,010
On the ready. Guns up!

222
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,280
We gotta get you back.

223
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,047
Here they come!

224
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,385
Weapons tight!
Weapons tight!

225
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,288
Everybody, stand by!

226
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,858
Everybody out!

227
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,861
On the ground!

228
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,930
Put
your weapons down.

229
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,598
Get on the ground!

230
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,534
Put your weapons down now!
Weapons down.

231
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,371
You! Put it down!

232
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,074
Put it...

233
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,309
- Put your weapons down!
- Drop it!

234
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,844
Drop your weapon!

235
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,011
You! Drop it.

236
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:08,213
Drop the gun!

237
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,883
Drop it!

238
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,284
Hold your fire!
Stop!

239
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,053
Stop!

240
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,188
Hold your fire!
Stop!

241
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,523
Hold your fire!
He needs help!

242
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,290
Hold your fire!

243
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,293
Drop it!

244
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,398
Give me one reason
i shouldn't shoot you.

245
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,499
Drop the gun!

246
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,610
I can't.

247
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,948
I guess that's the problem,
isn't it?

248
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,186
We blew up your mine.

249
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,556
You burned
my district to the ground.

250
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,160
We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.

251
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,064
So if you wanna kill me,
do it.

252
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,002
Make snow happy.

253
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,371
I'm tired of killing
his slaves for him.

254
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,474
I'm not his slave.

255
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,676
I am.

256
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,113
That's why I killed cato.

257
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,949
And he killed thresh.

258
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,385
And thresh killed clove.

259
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,923
It just goes
around and around.

260
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,090
And who wins?

261
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,960
Always snow.

262
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,298
I am done being
a piece in his game.

263
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,136
District 12, district 2.
We have no fight.

264
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,139
Except the one
the capitol gave us.

265
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,944
Why are you
fighting the rebels?

266
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,546
You're neighbors.

267
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,349
You're family.

268
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,639
These people
are not your enemy.

269
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,376
We all have one enemy.

270
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,112
And that's snow.

271
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,416
He corrupts everyone
and everything.

272
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,555
He turns the best of us
against each other.

273
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,325
Stop killing for him.

274
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,265
Tonight, turn your weapons
to the capitol.

275
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,270
Turn your weapons to snow.

276
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,678
 Tonight,
 turn your weapons
 to the capitol.

277
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,349
 Turn your weapons to snow.

278
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,587
 Hold your fire.

279
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,627
A toast.

280
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,467
Antonius,

281
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,638
with our best troops
crushed in the mountains

282
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,674
and the rebels
marching on us as we speak,

283
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,343
what did we celebrate?

284
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,281
The death of
the mockingjay, sir.

285
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,617
If peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.

286
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,435
Of course.

287
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,404
That's the same
facile thinking

288
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,506
that led you to divert
our best peacekeepers

289
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,641
into district 2.

290
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,080
You have a habit of burying
people before they're dead.

291
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,582
If the mockingjay were gone,

292
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,485
the rebels would already be
using her as a martyr.

293
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,822
No, minister Antonius,

294
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,526
I'm afraid that is not
what we were toasting at all.

295
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,462
Sir,

296
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,230
the rebels
can be held off out...

297
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,671
The rebels will reach
the outskirts of the capitol

298
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:27,638
in a matter of days.

299
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,544
We'll evacuate the outer
blocks to let them in.

300
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,382
I want all anti-aircraft
defenses ready,

301
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,251
so we're secure
from the skies.

302
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,788
Lure them into the city,

303
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,157
and then our gamemakers

304
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,127
will make them pay
for every inch with blood.

305
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,331
I want every camera watching.

306
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,833
We'll turn their advance into
a celebration of suffering.

307
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,706
Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.

308
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,280
So, what did we toast tonight,
minister Antonius?

309
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,153
We toasted a glorious era

310
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,824
coming to its bitter end.

311
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,268
Well, there she is.
The mockingjay.

312
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,907
Oh, that speech you gave.
Oh, man, feel.

313
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,675
I mean,
i still have goose bumps.

314
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,779
You don't mind, do you?

315
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,781
They cut off my supply
of morphling.

316
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,882
There's this head doctor
that comes in

317
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,384
and sees me every day,

318
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,519
trying to help me
adjust to reality.

319
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,223
Like some guy from
this rabbit's Warren

320
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,658
actually knows anything
about my reality.

321
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,631
At least 20 times
in a session,

322
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,966
he tells me
that I'm totally safe.

323
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,870
Safe from the capitol.

324
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,305
Safe from snow.

325
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,211
What about you, mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?

326
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,779
Till I got shot.

327
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,280
Oh, please.

328
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,549
The bullet didn't
even touch you.

329
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,884
Cinna saw to that. Of course,

330
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,219
your costume
would be bulletproof.

331
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,354
So what are your injuries?

332
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,559
Bruised ribs,
bruised lung.

333
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,729
I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.

334
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,864
I mean, I've got two.
Do you want one of mine?

335
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,935
I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.

336
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:38,970
Is that why you hate me?

337
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,638
Partly.

338
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,507
You're also a little
hard to swallow.

339
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,543
The whole tacky romance drama

340
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,744
and the "defender
of the hopeless" act.

341
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,680
Even though it's not an act.

342
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,382
Which makes it
even more unbearable.

343
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,386
Feel free to take
any of this personally.

344
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,288
You should have
been the mockingjay.

345
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:57,955
Nobody else would
tell you what to say.

346
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,957
But nobody likes me.

347
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,828
They're afraid of you.

348
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,862
Maybe here,

349
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,266
but in the capitol,
you're the only thing

350
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,300
that they're scared of.

351
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,907
It's just stuff
my family brought.

352
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,420
It's from peeta.

353
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,523
Yeah.

354
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,799
They messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?

355
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,570
We showed him
footage of your speech in 2.

356
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,472
He had real memories of you.

357
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,041
That still doesn't mean
I'm going in there.

358
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,342
He's strapped down.

359
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:52,910
He can't hurt you.
No.

360
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,346
This is different. Haymitch,
i really don't want to.

361
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,814
It doesn't matter
what you want.
It's for peeta.

362
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,318
What's the harm in trying?

363
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,870
I watched you die.

364
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,941
You look terrible.

365
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,943
You've looked better.

366
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,678
You're not even remotely nice
to say that to me now.

367
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,613
I was never the nice one.
You were.

368
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,721
When I saw you die,
i remembered something.

369
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:38,823
About the bread.

370
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,127
I remember you in the rain.

371
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,698
And I burned it on purpose.

372
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,401
To give it to you.

373
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,440
I remember
my mother hitting me.

374
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,910
I was supposed
to give it to the pig.

375
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,679
That was the first
we'd eaten in days.

376
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,716
Why would I take
a beating like that for you?

377
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,819
Because you were kind
and generous.

378
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,890
And people said you loved me.

379
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,958
Did people say you love me?

380
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,930
They said that's why snow
tortured you. To hurt me.

381
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,031
Snow says that
everything that

382
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:21,832
comes out of your mouth
is a lie.

383
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,638
All I know is that
i would have

384
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,106
saved myself
a lot of suffering,

385
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,009
if I'd just given
that bread to the pig.

386
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,635
I think the only thing left
to say is "thank you."

387
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,605
I need to be in the capitol.

388
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
No, you have done your job.

389
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,143
You've been very successful
as the mockingjay.

390
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:10,147
You've unified the districts.
And now we want you to rest.

391
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,183
And to heal.

392
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,652
The last the rebels saw me,
i was lying on the ground.

393
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,521
Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.

394
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,124
We'll shoot more propos
right here in 13,

395
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,559
showing them
that you're alive.

396
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,027
I should be with the troops.

397
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,829
It'll be like being
on the front lines.

398
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,630
As far as the soldiers know,

399
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,667
you survived
a bullet to the heart.

400
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,036
I think they'll understand
why you're not with them.

401
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,071
When we win this war,

402
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,574
we'll fly you in
for the surrender.

403
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,942
We'll need you
for the ceremony.

404
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,176
You're very valuable to us.

405
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,050
I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

406
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,752
 From this day forth,

407
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,921
 in sickness and in health,

408
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,259
 for richer or poorer.

409
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,929
 I promise to love and
 Cherish you each day.

410
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,533
I, finnick odair,

411
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,637
take you, Annie cresta,

412
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,538
as my wife
from this day forth.

413
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,543
 Together or apart,
 we will always be united.

414
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,281
 One life, one purpose,
 one destiny.

415
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,017
You may kiss the bride.

416
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,790
You saw peeta,
didn't you?

417
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,094
Did you tell him "hi" for me?

418
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,163
We're old friends, you know.

419
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,132
We had adjoining cells
in the capitol.

420
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,200
We're very familiar
with each other's screams.

421
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,671
I'm going to kill snow.

422
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,276
Nothing good is safe
while he's alive.

423
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:24,281
And I can't make
another speech about it.

424
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:27,284
No more cameras.
No more propos.

425
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,754
No more games.

426
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,960
He needs to see my eyes
when I kill him.

427
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,068
Now you're talking.

428
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,073
Find a way to the capitol

429
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,175
when everybody's looking
the other way.

430
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,943
I hear the medics talking.

431
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,378
They're shipping supplies
for the front line

432
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,846
from hangar two
around midnight tonight.

433
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,749
Medicine, painkillers.

434
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,751
I was gonna go
steal some for myself,

435
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:05,055
but I guess I could
just stay here
and cover for you.

436
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,926
Anybody can kill
anybody, katniss.

437
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,829
Even a president.

438
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,664
You just have to be willing
to sacrifice yourself.

439
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,407
Go on.

440
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,808
Don't you want snow
to see you dance?

441
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,575
Hey, that's her.

442
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,019
That's
katniss everdeen.

443
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,348
Hey. Thought you were
in the hospital.

444
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,282
I was.

445
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,385
Come on.

446
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,453
 What is she doing?

447
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,056
I don't know,
it's so frustrating

448
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:00,257
when she goes rogue.

449
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,025
This isn't
just adolescent,

450
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,193
it's insubordination.

451
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,463
Put her on the first
hovercraft back.

452
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,632
Don't be ridiculous.
She can't come back now.

453
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,567
She's mythic.

454
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,572
At the front lines,
surviving a gunshot wound.

455
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,909
Couldn't have staged it
better myself.

456
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,445
Hmm. I know.

457
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,616
She's going to stay
where she is.

458
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,122
And whatever she's doing,
we conceived it.

459
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,525
It was our plan all along.

460
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,395
Course it was.

461
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,000
Mr. heavensbee,
you're the gamemaker.

462
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,905
I want everyone to know,
whatever game she's playing,

463
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,239
she's playing for us.

464
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,953
 I'm commander paylor
 of district 8.

465
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,354
 I'm a soldier,
 like all of you,

466
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,957
 so here's what I know.

467
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,092
 For the first time
 in our lifetimes,

468
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,429
 we're standing together
 with 13 districts.

469
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,032
 From what I see here,
 we've already made history.

470
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,673
 But history doesn't stop
 to celebrate.

471
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,474
 And we're facing an enemy
 that will not change

472
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,543
 and will never surrender.

473
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,412
 President snow has
 pulled back peacekeepers

474
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:31,048
 to fortify the center
 of the city.

475
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,684
 He's evacuating residents
 from the outer blocks.

476
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,153
 These civilians will be
 confused and desperate.

477
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,121
 You are under orders
 not to target them.

478
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,590
 We're deploying
 medical brigades

479
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,359
 to help anyone in need.

480
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,127
 We'll show the capitol people
 who we are.

481
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,497
 To slow our advance,
 president snow

482
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,033
 is building
 a minefield of traps

483
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,736
 and lethal devices
 called "pods."

484
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,738
 The sadistic inventions
 of gamemakers

485
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,672
 meant to make sport
 of our deaths.

486
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,709
 If our armies make it
 past peacekeepers

487
00:32:58,711 --> 00:32:58,709
 and other defenses,

488
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:02,412
 we'll converge in the center
 of the city at snow's mansion,

489
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,081
 where we won't just
 unlock his gates,

490
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,083
 but unshackle all of panem.

491
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:16,293
 If we die, let it be for
 a cause and not a spectacle.

492
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,395
 If we succeed,
 let it be for all of panem,

493
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,563
 and let it be forever.

494
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,766
 Yes, you've already
 made history.

495
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:29,740
 But the future, our future,
 starts tomorrow at dawn,

496
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:32,142
 when we march together
 into the capitol.

497
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,594
Squad 451?

498
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,336
Looks like you got
your meals covered.

499
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,571
Tryin' to be prepared.

500
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,573
Don't lie to me.

501
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:03,573
We've been hunting together
all our lives.

502
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,145
I know when you're gonna
go off on your own.

503
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,185
You gonna leave
me behind, too?

504
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,686
As your fellow soldier,

505
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,657
I suggest that
you stay with your unit.

506
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,462
But I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.

507
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:29,099
Hawthorne, everdeen,
come meet your new unit.

508
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,442
I'm lieutenant Jackson,

509
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,643
and I wanna introduce you
to your squad.

510
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,113
This is
second lieutenant Mitchell,

511
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,549
best sharpshooter in panem.

512
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:48,652
These are the leeg sisters.
First combat division.

513
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,320
And this is corporal homes.

514
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:53,857
Finnick?

515
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,195
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

516
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:00,097
That was a short honeymoon.

517
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,566
Yeah, well,

518
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:05,469
I guess we're gonna have to
have one in the capitol.

519
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,670
- After we take it.
- Gather 'round.

520
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,479
Squad 451, you're my unit.

521
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,415
Lieutenant Jackson is
my second-in-command.

522
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,619
Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.

523
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,888
But we are a non-combat unit.

524
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,557
So we'll be following days
behind the front-line troops.

525
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,760
You're to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.

526
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,196
"The star squad."

527
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,631
It's been decided that
you're most effective

528
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,765
when seen by the masses.

529
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,300
So we're not gonna fight?

530
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,668
You'll do whatever
you're ordered to do, soldier.

531
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,469
It's not your job
to ask questions.

532
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,772
Yes, sir.

533
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,674
Our instructions are
to shoot propaganda footage

534
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,410
on the battle-scarred streets
of the capitol.

535
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,246
You were handpicked
to intimidate their forces.

536
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,715
And inspire surrenders.

537
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,216
Even though we'll be
working on abandoned streets

538
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,618
miles behind the front lines,

539
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,253
I guarantee you,
wherever they put us,

540
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,587
it will not be safe.

541
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,923
This is a war zone.

542
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,626
It is likely that we'll
encounter both active pods

543
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:03,593
and peacekeepers.

544
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,763
You're considered high-value
targets to the capitol.

545
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,332
In the event of capture,

546
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,268
you'll be given
a nightlock pill.

547
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,569
A poison that
acts immediately.

548
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,771
Lieutenant Jackson,
do the honors.

549
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:15,605
I've already
briefed you on the pods.

550
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,775
I remind you,
they are on every block.

551
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,912
Our unit has
been given a holo.

552
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,918
A database that contains
a detailed map of the capitol

553
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,220
and a list of every known pod.

554
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,889
These pods can trigger
anything from bombs

555
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,492
to traps to mutts.

556
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,561
We cannot move
without this device.

557
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,796
There's no guarantee
that our database is complete.

558
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,298
There could be new pods
that we're not aware of.

559
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,732
Because we don't want
the gamemakers to know

560
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,568
we have this intel,

561
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,369
it has a self-destruct on it.

562
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,705
You flip this switch,
say "nightlock" three times,

563
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,706
and it blows itself
and anything

564
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,541
within a 10-foot radius.

565
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,277
Stay within our unit.

566
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,246
Even with the holo,

567
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:59,249
it is likely that new pods
have been set.

568
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,651
Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.

569
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,855
Ladies and gentlemen,

570
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,557
welcome to
the 76th hunger games.

571
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,255
I've never
seen this place so empty.

572
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,556
Just keep your eyes open.

573
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,014
Got a pod.
Let's take cover.

574
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,323
Shoot through
those two buildings.

575
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,062
Pollux, right here.

576
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,598
Castor.

577
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,936
Good.

578
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,477
When you're ready, katniss.

579
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,420
Hold it. Pollux, tighter.

580
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,622
Okay.

581
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,420
All clear.

582
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,591
 I don't think we can
 get across this minefield.

583
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,129
Not without that holo.

584
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,465
We're not gonna
get it off him
while he's awake.

585
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:29,566
Let's make sure we're on
the same watch tonight.

586
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,807
Is that peacekeepers?

587
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,482
451 to base.

588
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,016
We've got a truck coming in
from the south. Over.

589
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,855
Copy that. Over.

590
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,556
Stand down, everyone.
It's friendly.

591
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,197
My name is peeta mellark.

592
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,865
My home is district 12.

593
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,069
My name is peeta mellark.
My home is district 12.

594
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,872
Okay, stop.
My name is peeta mellark.

595
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:45,108
Hold up. Everyone relax.

596
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,176
My home is district 12.

597
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:47,043
What are we doin'?

598
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:49,879
Jackson, cuff him.

599
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,757
Soldier, this is
just a precaution

600
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,125
till we can get everything
straightened out. Yeah?

601
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,930
My name's peeta mellark.
From district 12.

602
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,902
 They want us
 to add him to the propo.

603
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:13,970
Show that he's
on our side now.

604
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,106
We'll move forward
a few blocks tomorrow

605
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,708
and shoot the new footage.

606
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,643
He's not in control
of himself.

607
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,580
I say we schedule an
around-the-clock watch on him.

608
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,915
The leegs till 1700,
homes and Mitchell till 1900.

609
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,084
Give me a watch.

610
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:31,888
And if it really
came down to it,

611
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,956
you think
you could shoot him?

612
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,058
I wouldn't be shooting peeta.

613
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,594
Be killing a capitol mutt.

614
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,028
I'm not sure
that kind of a comment

615
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,930
recommends you for the job,
either, soldier.

616
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,132
Put her in the rotation.

617
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,157
He's gonna try to kill me.

618
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,192
Especially with
all this going on.

619
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,260
It's gonna set him off.

620
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,829
We'll keep him contained.

621
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,697
Why would coin do this?

622
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,870
Here's all I know.

623
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,974
It was peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.

624
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,744
She never liked you.

625
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:30,280
She doesn't like
anybody or anything
she can't control.

626
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,615
So she would
put my life in danger?

627
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:33,716
She'd deny it, but...

628
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,586
What?

629
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,288
One way or another,
this war is gonna
come to an end.

630
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,124
They promised a free election.

631
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,193
Maybe she's startin' to
see you as a threat.

632
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,331
Nobody would think
I'd be a leader.

633
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,866
But you'd throw
your support to someone.

634
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:50,867
Would it be her?

635
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,005
And if your immediate answer
isn't "yes,"

636
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:56,940
then you're dangerous.

637
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,177
She doesn't need you
as a rallying cry anymore.

638
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,979
These propos
can be done without you.

639
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,781
There's only one thing
you could do now

640
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,215
to add more fire
to this rebellion.

641
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,918
Die.

642
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,887
That's not gonna happen
under my watch, katniss.

643
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,058
I'm plannin' for you
to have a long life.

644
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,961
Why?
You don't owe me anything.

645
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,164
Because you've earned it.

646
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,243
We've been here
before, you know.

647
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,313
What?

648
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,016
That look.

649
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,819
I've seen that look.

650
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,991
You're trying to decide

651
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:49,092
whether or not
you should kill me.

652
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,861
I never wanted to kill you.

653
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,932
And that's not
what I'm doing.

654
00:43:55,934 --> 00:44:00,169
I saw it with my own eyes.
In the first games.

655
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,404
In the first games,
i thought you were

656
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,206
trying to help
the careers kill me.

657
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,212
After that,
i always saw you as an ally.

658
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,351
Friend, lover,

659
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,021
Victor,

660
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,123
fiancee,

661
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,826
enemy, target, mutt.

662
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,896
And now ally?

663
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,097
Yeah, I'll add that
to the list of words

664
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:28,865
I use to try
to figure you out.

665
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,372
I'm sorry.

666
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:43,713
I just can't tell
what's real and
what's made up anymore.

667
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:45,415
Then ask.

668
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,116
It's what Annie does.

669
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,985
Ask who?

670
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,154
Us. We're your unit now.

671
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,733
Your favorite color is green.

672
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,270
Is that real?

673
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,441
Yeah. That's real.

674
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,911
Yours is orange.

675
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,449
Not bright orange.

676
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,286
Soft, like the sunset.

677
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,322
Thank you.

678
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,296
You're a painter.

679
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,466
You're a Baker.

680
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,038
You always sleep
with the windows open.

681
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,843
You never take sugar
in your tea.

682
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,247
You always
double-knot your shoelaces.

683
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,251
You were right.

684
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,955
I can't do this.

685
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,934
Guess we're not
leavin' anymore.

686
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,339
We're not going anywhere
without that holo.

687
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,342
Listen up.

688
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,478
Mag's empty.

689
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,817
It's only for the propo.

690
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,358
Let's move. We're headed
five blocks north.

691
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,940
 "To the citizens
 of the capitol,

692
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,508
 "our war is not with you."

693
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,010
 To the citizens
 of the capitol,

694
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:56,979
 our war is not with you.

695
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,915
"You will be a vital part
of the democracy

696
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,283
"that follows our victory."

697
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:02,251
Be a vital part
of the democracy

698
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,220
that follows our victory.

699
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,254
You got it.

700
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:06,322
Okay.

701
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,877
Boggs. This is a good spot.

702
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,247
Through there,
in the courtyard.

703
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:32,882
Okay, let us clear it.

704
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,569
Got a pod.

705
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,239
Split. Take cover.

706
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,253
Stay back.

707
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,048
All clear.
Gale, homes, with me.

708
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:39,949
Leegs, take the wings.

709
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,510
Everdeen, no!

710
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:08,611
Boggs!

711
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:09,679
Hold your position!

712
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,480
Boggs!

713
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,616
Grab the tourniquets
from the bag. Give it to me.

714
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,217
Squeeze his legs
as hard as you can.

715
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:16,352
It's okay.

716
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,254
The holo. The holo.

717
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,526
Unfit for command.

718
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,528
Transfer primary
security clearance...

719
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,029
Say your name.

720
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,031
Katniss everdeen.

721
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,666
What did you just do?

722
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:34,270
Katniss, don't trust them.

723
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,572
Kill peeta, if you have to.

724
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,207
Do what you came to do.

725
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,409
Boggs? Boggs?

726
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,315
No.

727
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:56,025
Come on. Come on.

728
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,727
He's gone. He's gone.

729
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,760
Go, go, go!

730
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,528
- Let's go!
- Move!

731
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:32,528
This way!
Keep moving

732
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,066
let's go, soldiers!

733
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,768
Get to higher ground!
Come on!

734
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:39,668
Move!

735
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,510
Finnick!

736
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:48,344
Finnick, restrain him!

737
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:49,812
Peeta!

738
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,248
Mitchell!

739
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,284
Come on, come on!

740
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,786
Settle, settle!

741
00:50:56,788 --> 00:50:59,355
Come on!
Don't stop! Let's go!

742
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:01,157
Come on, come on!
We gotta move!

743
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,158
Get inside!

744
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,563
Everybody, inside!
Go! Upstairs! Go! Hurry up!

745
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,165
Move!

746
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,399
Come on!

747
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,233
Move it! Move!

748
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,402
- Go! Go!
- Move!

749
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,276
Keep moving!

750
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,411
Keep moving to the top!

751
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,647
Go!

752
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,192
Hey, hey!

753
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:37,493
I got you.

754
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,836
It's slowing down.

755
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,154
Gamemakers are still
putting on quite a show.

756
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,823
451 to base. Over.

757
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:10,159
Hey, we better move.

758
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,828
If peacekeepers didn't know
where we were, they do now.

759
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,164
Those surveillance
cameras caught us.

760
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,666
451 to base.
Come in.

761
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:20,736
This is a bad spot.
We need to move now.

762
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,905
451 to base. Over.

763
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:27,409
I can't get a signal.

764
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:29,712
But I can get us back to base.
Everdeen, give me the holo.

765
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:33,849
Everdeen, what did I just say?
The holo. Come on, let's go.

766
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,919
Boggs gave it to me.

767
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,455
What are you talking about?

768
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:42,191
He did. He transferred
security clearance to her.

769
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,392
I saw him.

770
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,595
And why would he do that?

771
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,666
I'm on special orders
from coin.

772
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,568
To do what?

773
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,470
To assassinate
president snow.

774
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,477
I don't believe that
for one second.

775
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,612
As your new unit commander,
i order you

776
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,881
to transfer security
clearance to me now.

777
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,917
I can't do that.

778
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,623
Let's not
lose our heads here.

779
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,396
I'm not asking you again,
everdeen.

780
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,264
Give me that holo.

781
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,904
She's telling the truth.
Plutarch wants it televised.

782
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,639
He thinks if we could film

783
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,541
the mockingjay
assassinating snow,

784
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,210
it'll make
the capitol surrender

785
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,278
before the casualties
get too high.

786
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,580
While we're arguing,

787
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:38,514
there's 100 peacekeepers
on their way here.

788
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,687
Boggs promised me that
when the time came,

789
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,655
you would help me.

790
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,675
All right, soldier,
holo's yours.

791
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,888
I don't think we're gonna
leave any footprints.

792
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,323
We should move now.

793
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:22,558
And those cameras outside

794
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,759
should be
covered up by the oil.

795
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,661
She can't move
forward like this.

796
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:28,364
Her leg is too bad.
We have to evacuate her.

797
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,368
I'm sorry.

798
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,470
I'll stay with her.

799
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,572
As soon as
we make contact,

800
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:38,374
we will send somebody back.
I promise you.

801
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,479
All right, everybody,
move out.

802
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:44,446
- Let's go!
- Let's get him up.

803
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,449
Can you walk?

804
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,662
Come on, this way.

805
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,917
Get these
curtains closed.

806
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,412
It's the leegs.

807
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,640
 Good afternoon.
 I'm Caesar flickerman.

808
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:52,474
 Here with our
 continuing coverage

809
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,078
 of the defense of the capitol.

810
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,983
 Today, as our peacekeepers
 valiantly hold off the rebels,

811
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:04,887
 our story takes
 a surprising twist.

812
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,790
 Katniss everdeen,
 our once favorite daughter,

813
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,758
 has infiltrated the city

814
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,627
 with some of the Victors,

815
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,929
 whose names
 are all too familiar.

816
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,931
 Finnick odair
 and peeta mellark.

817
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,802
 Hmm.

818
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:22,671
 Clearly, some alliances
 don't last forever.

819
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,810
 Take a look at what happened
 just a moment ago,

820
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:30,946
 when our peacekeepers cornered
 katniss everdeen

821
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,682
 and her band
 of foolish rebels.

822
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,451
 Whatever arrogance

823
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:38,654
 brought this treacherous girl
 back to us,

824
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:40,889
 you are about to witness
 a great victory,

825
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,025
 not only for the capitol,
 but for panem.

826
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,981
 So there you have it.

827
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:09,117
 Katniss everdeen,
 the girl on fire,

828
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,987
 a girl who inspired
 so much violence,

829
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,723
 seems to have met
 a violent end herself.

830
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,993
 Stay tuned
 for more information.

831
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,695
 Caesar flickerman. Thank you.

832
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:22,731
So now that we're dead,
what are we gonna do?

833
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,532
Isn't it obvious?

834
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:26,969
The next move
is to kill me.

835
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,109
I murdered
one of our squad members.

836
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,815
Katniss is right.

837
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,753
I'm a mutt.

838
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:47,956
And it's only
a matter of time
before I snap again.

839
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,126
I'm not in control.

840
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,099
I need a nightlock pill,
so I can die when I need to.

841
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,601
If it gets to that point,
I'll kill you myself.

842
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,221
I don't think
i ever really understood

843
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,857
the capitol until now.

844
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:23,792
You eat like this,
you'll believe anything.

845
00:59:55,592 --> 01:00:00,028
 So katniss everdeen,
 a poor unstable girl

846
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,263
 with nothing
 but a small talent

847
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,333
 with a bow and arrow is dead.

848
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:09,304
 Not a thinker, not a leader.

849
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,007
 Simply a face
 plucked from the masses.

850
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,875
 Was she valuable?

851
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:17,012
 She was extremely valuable
 to your rebellion

852
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:19,915
 because you have no vision,

853
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,984
 no true leader among you.

854
01:00:21,986 --> 01:00:25,153
You call yourselves
an alliance.

855
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:27,656
But we saw what that means.

856
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:30,659
Your soldiers are
at each other's throats.

857
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,001
 Good evening. For those of you
 who don't know me,

858
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:42,004
 please, allow me
 to introduce myself.

859
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:46,642
 I am president Alma coin,
 leader of the rebellion.

860
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:49,211
 I have interrupted a broadcast
 from your president

861
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:53,248
 in which he attempted to
 defame a brave young woman.

862
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,785
 "A face picked from
 the masses," he called her.

863
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:57,953
Plucked.

864
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,288
 As if a leader,

865
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,126
 a true leader,
 could be anything else.

866
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:06,928
I had the privilege of knowing

867
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,732
a small-town girl
from the seam in district 12

868
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:13,702
who survived the hunger games
and the quarter quell

869
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:16,104
and rose up and turned

870
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:19,374
a nation of slaves
into an army!

871
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,211
Dead or alive,
katniss everdeen

872
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:24,980
will remain the face
of this revolution.

873
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,283
 She will not have
 died for nothing.

874
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:30,886
I had no idea
i meant so much to her.

875
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:34,089
 Her vision and ours
 will be realized.

876
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:36,892
 A free panem

877
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:39,361
 with self-determination
 for all.

878
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,931
 And in her memory,
 we will all find the strength

879
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:45,867
 to rid panem
 of its oppressors.

880
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,437
 Thank you. And be safe.

881
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,277
Snow's in his mansion.
Where is that?

882
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:02,350
That's us.

883
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,921
That's the city circle.

884
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:08,790
It's at least
70, 75 blocks north.

885
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,926
Seventy-five blocks?

886
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,794
Uh-huh.

887
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:15,797
Nobody knows we're alive.
This is our chance.

888
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:18,266
These buildings. Do these
look over snow's gardens?

889
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:20,268
I...
They do.

890
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,337
If he goes outside at all,
i could get a clear shot.

891
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:24,506
We're getting
ahead of ourselves here.

892
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:26,875
Whether they're
looking for us or not,
we are pinned down.

893
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,510
Hit that button.
Scan for pods.

894
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,515
Just about
every 10 steps.

895
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:36,084
Yeah, that doesn't even
show the new ones.

896
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,253
So we can't go anywhere
in the streets.

897
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,221
And the rooftops
are just as bad.

898
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,060
There might be another way.

899
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,101
My brother knows
these tunnels really well.

900
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:58,173
He worked sanitation
down here.

901
01:02:58,175 --> 01:02:59,341
Right after they
made him an avox.

902
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,220
Hey. Hey.

903
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:17,125
You gonna be okay?
Look at me. Look at me.

904
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,228
We're gonna get through this.
I promise.

905
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,814
Took us five years to
buy his way outta here.

906
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:40,182
He didn't see the sun once.

907
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,190
We're too exposed here.

908
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,351
Sir, should i
call for your doctor?

909
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,488
What did you say?

910
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,923
Shall I call for your doctor?

911
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,894
I hope you've wakened me
for something more urgent

912
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,363
than an old man's health.

913
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,666
They survived.
I don't know how.

914
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:07,002
We picked them up
on a surveillance cam.

915
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:09,371
Let me see. I...
I need to see for myself.

916
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,109
It's her.

917
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,178
It is her.

918
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,551
The arena has
moved underground.

919
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:44,572
Looks clear.

920
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,699
Everybody okay?

921
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,436
Yeah.

922
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,530
All right, everybody,

923
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,065
we're gonna
stop here for a bit
and get some rest, yeah?

924
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,737
I'll take first watch.

925
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,211
Hey, peeta.
Just tuck in there.

926
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,319
All right,
settle in, everybody.

927
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,376
Katniss? Your watch.

928
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,670
You know, the capitol,

929
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:58,406
they used tracker jacker
venom on me.

930
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:02,243
That's what
the doctors in 13 said.

931
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,546
You were stung once, too.

932
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,682
Real or not real?

933
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,553
Real.

934
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:14,556
When they used
the venom on me,

935
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,658
they would show me
pictures of my life.

936
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,329
But some weren't real.

937
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,565
They changed them.

938
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,239
At first, they all...
They all blurred together.

939
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:35,677
But now... now I can
sort them out a little.

940
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,413
Like the ones that
they changed,

941
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:40,882
they have this quality...

942
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:44,886
It's like they're shiny.
They've been glossed over.

943
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,691
You should get some rest.

944
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,530
You're still trying
to protect me.

945
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:57,165
Real or not real?

946
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:58,333
Real.

947
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:01,469
That's what you and I do.

948
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:04,706
Keep each other alive.

949
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,646
Katniss.
Katniss. Katniss.

950
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:25,653
Katniss?

951
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,330
What is that?

952
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:36,998
We gotta go.
We gotta get outta here now.

953
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,866
Keep your voice down.
Mutts! They released mutts.

954
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,235
Pollux, what's
the fastest way out?

955
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:41,269
Come on! Go! Go!

956
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,898
Go! Go! Go! It's mutts!
Come on, come on, come on!

957
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,566
Pollux,
lead us out of here!

958
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:28,736
Come on!

959
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,184
Castor!

960
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,452
Castor!

961
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:51,759
Fall back!

962
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,128
Move!

963
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,068
Katniss, come on! Move!

964
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:40,768
Katniss!

965
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,702
Katniss!

966
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,856
Go, go, go, go, go!

967
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,171
Go, go, go!

968
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,813
Katniss!

969
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:00,681
No!
Finnick!

970
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:03,751
Finnick!

971
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,824
Katniss!

972
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:14,095
Nightlock. Nightlock.
Nightlock.

973
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:18,399
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

974
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,667
Keep moving! Keep moving!

975
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:24,405
Ow!

976
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,651
Go! Go!

977
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,152
Keep going! Keep going!

978
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,286
Peeta, come on!

979
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:14,755
Peeta!

980
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,725
Peeta, we have to
keep going!

981
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,460
I'm a mutt!
I can't keep control!

982
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:21,062
Yes, you can! Look at me!
Leave me! I'm a mutt!

983
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,396
Look at me! Look at me.

984
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,403
Stay with me.

985
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,206
Always.

986
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,307
Come on.

987
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:38,813
I know where we are!

988
01:18:38,815 --> 01:18:40,781
I know a place.
Up those stairs.

989
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,188
Keep going.

990
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:09,977
Someone's coming.

991
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:15,449
Shut the door,
shut the door!

992
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,452
No, katniss,
it's okay, it's okay.

993
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,054
It's okay.

994
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,058
Tigris, do you remember me?

995
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:27,261
I'm with plutarch's
underground.

996
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,829
We need your help.

997
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:29,497
Clear!

998
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:58,359
I know you.

999
01:19:58,361 --> 01:19:59,560
You were a stylist
in the games.

1000
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,500
Until snow decided I wasn't
pretty enough anymore.

1001
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,505
I'm here to kill him.

1002
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,619
Gale's gonna need stitches.

1003
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:12,333
I made it up.

1004
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,302
All of it.

1005
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,140
There is no special mission
from coin.

1006
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,609
There's only my plan.

1007
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:28,048
Everyone that's dead is dead
because of me. I lied.

1008
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,285
We know. We all knew.

1009
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:32,620
The soldiers from 13?

1010
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:34,521
They did, too.

1011
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,257
Do you really believe
that Jackson thought

1012
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:37,491
you had orders from coin?

1013
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,363
She trusted boggs
and he clearly
wanted you to go on.

1014
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,601
I never meant
for this to happen.

1015
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:51,538
I failed. I...

1016
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:58,379
I killed them.
I killed finnick.

1017
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,348
I'm sorry, pollux.

1018
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,952
I'm so sorry.

1019
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:10,291
Glimmer,
marvel, mags,

1020
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:17,431
clove, wiress, rue.

1021
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:22,503
What do all those deaths mean?

1022
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,242
They mean that our lives
were never ours.

1023
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:34,114
There was no real life

1024
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,282
because we didn't
have any choice.

1025
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:41,255
Our lives belong to snow
and our deaths do, too.

1026
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,060
But if you kill him,
katniss...

1027
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,196
If you end all of this,

1028
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:55,135
all those deaths,
they mean something.

1029
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:01,141
Cinna, boggs, castor,

1030
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,745
Jackson, finnick.

1031
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,183
They chose this.

1032
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,288
They chose you.

1033
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,762
Should keep these clean.

1034
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:22,696
Otherwise they'll
get infected.

1035
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:28,035
You should cuff me.

1036
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:31,038
It's not safe with me yet.

1037
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,707
I have moments
when I'm here.

1038
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,745
And my memories
are getting better,

1039
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:41,715
but other times it's like
I'm sleepwalking.

1040
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:48,722
You should cuff me.

1041
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,313
Thanks.

1042
01:24:13,315 --> 01:24:14,148
No problem.

1043
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:23,590
I can't sleep.

1044
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,225
Yeah, I haven't slept
in days, either.

1045
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,568
I should've volunteered
to take your place

1046
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,769
in the first games.

1047
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,572
No, you couldn't have.

1048
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,709
No, she never
would have forgiven you.

1049
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:44,311
She needed you to be there

1050
01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:45,512
and take care
of her family and you did.

1051
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,648
She can't lose you.

1052
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,319
She really loves you.

1053
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,258
And the way she kissed you
in the quarter quell.

1054
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:01,829
She never kissed me
like that.

1055
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:03,297
Oh, just part of the show.

1056
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:05,833
No. No, you won her over.

1057
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,336
You gave up
everything for her.

1058
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:16,610
Well, it's not gonna be
an issue much longer.

1059
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:20,681
I doubt all three of us
are gonna make it out of this.

1060
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:24,384
And if we do, then

1061
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:25,486
it's her problem
whom to choose, right?

1062
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,122
Yeah.

1063
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,690
I do know
that katniss will pick

1064
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:30,824
whoever she can't
survive without.

1065
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:40,434
Mortar shells. It's not ours.

1066
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:42,369
Peacekeepers must be shellin'
the rebels outside the city.

1067
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,738
That's not outside the city.

1068
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,515
Sun's comin' up.

1069
01:25:54,517 --> 01:25:56,717
There's some small-arms fire.
Could be paylor, maybe lyme.

1070
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,452
Rebels are close.

1071
01:25:58,454 --> 01:25:59,453
This is it.

1072
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:12,533
 To all capitol citizens

1073
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:16,303
 more than a half mile
 outside the city circle,

1074
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:19,473
 I am announcing
 a mandatory evacuation.

1075
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:21,575
 Come to the mansion.

1076
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:24,545
 I am promising you
 shelter and sanctuary.

1077
01:26:24,547 --> 01:26:28,782
 All refugees, come to my home.

1078
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:31,552
 And there you will be
 provided with food,

1079
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:35,656
 medicine,
 safety for your children,

1080
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:37,491
 and you will have
 my solemn oath

1081
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:40,727
 to protect you
 until my dying breath.

1082
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:42,596
Wish he'd hurry up
with that last part.

1083
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:46,967
 Our enemy is not like us.
 They do not share our values.

1084
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:48,769
 They have never
 known our comfort

1085
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:51,705
 and our sophistication.

1086
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:54,775
 And they despise us for it.
 Make no mistake.

1087
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:58,312
 They are not coming
 to liberate us.

1088
01:26:58,314 --> 01:27:00,781
 They are coming
 to destroy our way of life.

1089
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:05,319
 They are coming to bury us.

1090
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:08,922
Is he still in the mansion?

1091
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:11,858
Peeta?

1092
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,328
Yeah. I recognize the room.

1093
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:16,863
Where is that?

1094
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:19,967
About five blocks away.

1095
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:24,605
We're right here.
Off the avenues.

1096
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:25,973
Mansion's here.

1097
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:27,708
What about the pods?

1098
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,710
They'll probably
deactivate the pods

1099
01:27:29,712 --> 01:27:31,878
around here
for the residents' safety.

1100
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,849
That could work.
I could get close enough.

1101
01:27:35,851 --> 01:27:38,252
Every peacekeeper's
gonna be waiting.

1102
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:39,686
Next to our faces
on every billboard.

1103
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,557
Snow's offering shelter
to all the refugees.

1104
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,664
Head straight north.

1105
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,866
There's gonna be
thousands of refugees.

1106
01:27:52,868 --> 01:27:54,001
Just get into that stream
and don't look up.

1107
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:56,970
We got one shot.

1108
01:27:58,573 --> 01:27:59,840
Let's make it count.

1109
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,877
Good luck, katniss.

1110
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:07,981
Thank you.

1111
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:11,652
Pollux.

1112
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,435
Tigris, thank you
for everything you've done.

1113
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:30,437
Katniss, let me
come with you, okay?

1114
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:32,539
I can be a good distraction.
They know my face.

1115
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,573
No, I'm not
losing you again.

1116
01:28:33,575 --> 01:28:34,841
You'll be
safer with us.

1117
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,376
What if peacekeepers
are searching the houses?

1118
01:28:36,378 --> 01:28:38,045
And if he's captured...

1119
01:28:38,047 --> 01:28:39,880
Then give me
a nightlock pill, okay?
I'm not goin' back.

1120
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,777
Stay alive.

1121
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,922
If I see you again,
it's gonna be
a different world.

1122
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,833
Ready, katniss?

1123
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:36,870
Let's go.

1124
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,854
 By order of president snow,

1125
01:29:53,856 --> 01:29:57,457
 all residents must proceed
 to the presidential estate.

1126
01:29:57,459 --> 01:29:59,593
 Please, continue
 to move forward

1127
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:03,029
 in a calm and orderly fashion.

1128
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:06,166
 Additional food,
 medicine and clothing

1129
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:07,968
 will be provided upon arrival.

1130
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,172
 By order

 ...all residents must proceed
 to the presidential estate.

1151

 in a calm and orderly fashion.

1153

01:31:21,944 --> 01:31:23,910
 will be provided upon arrival.

1155
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,181
 By order
 of president snow,

1156
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:31,952
 all residents must proceed
 to the presidential estate.

1157
01:31:31,954 --> 01:31:34,554
 Please, continue
 to move forward

1158
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:35,989
 in a calm and orderly fashion.

1159
01:31:37,592 --> 01:31:39,826
 Additional food,
 medicine and clothing

1160
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,561
 will be provided upon arrival.

1161
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,003
It's the rebels!

1162
01:32:23,005 --> 01:32:24,738
The rebels
are attacking!

1163
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,172
- Rebels!
- Rebels!

1164
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:28,775
It's the rebels!

1165
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:33,580
Run! Run!

1166
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:40,921
Mama! Mama!

1167
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,989
Come on!

1168
01:32:58,172 --> 01:32:59,205
Come on, come on!

1169
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,246
Shoot me!

1170
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:43,650
Shoot me!

1171
01:34:31,433 --> 01:34:33,333
 Stay calm.

1172
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:36,670
 Bring your children forward.

1173
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:38,705
 The gates will
 open momentarily.

1174
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,242
 The children
 will be received first.

1175
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:46,713
 Stay calm.

1176
01:34:46,715 --> 01:34:49,816
 Bring your children forward.

1177
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:52,919
 The gates will
 open momentarily.

1178
01:34:52,921 --> 01:34:56,256
 The children
 will be received first.

1179
01:34:56,258 --> 01:34:57,691
Mom!

1180
01:34:57,693 --> 01:34:59,225
 Stay calm.

1181
01:34:59,227 --> 01:35:00,860
 Bring your children forward.

1182
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,432
 The gates will
 open momentarily.

1183
01:35:05,434 --> 01:35:08,001
 The children
 will be received first.

1184
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:20,146
It's the capitol!

1185
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:27,287
Gifts from the capitol!

1186
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,229
Gifts!

1187
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,208
Medic!

1188
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,212
Medic!

1189
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,449
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

1190
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:31,217
Medics coming in!

1191
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:32,218
Bring a stretcher!

1192
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:34,220
This way, this way!

1193
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:38,024
Prim?

1194
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,260
Primrose!

1195
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:43,396
Prim!

1196
01:37:23,572 --> 01:37:25,538
Hey.
I need you to lie back.

1197
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:30,610
You're okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1198
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:37,417
Fight was over
after the capitol

1199
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:39,419
dropped those bombs
to defend the palace.

1200
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,022
The rebels walked right in.

1201
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,895
Don't, katniss.
The ointment's working.

1202
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:51,598
Everybody felt it.

1203
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:58,171
Peacekeepers, palace guards.
They had kids in there, too.

1204
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:00,573
It was...

1205
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,914
It was over after that.

1206
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,259
Mom?

1207
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:36,209
I remember the first
time I brought you here.

1208
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:39,913
And here we are.

1209
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:44,517
I brought all your things.

1210
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:57,397
Well, I'll leave you
to get settled.

1211
01:40:21,749 --> 01:40:24,150
Sorry, ma'am.
Can't let you pass.

1212
01:40:24,152 --> 01:40:26,052
Let her in.

1213
01:40:26,054 --> 01:40:28,287
On my authority.

1214
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:29,622
She has a right
to anything behind that door.

1215
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:59,285
That's a nice one.

1216
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:01,821
The colors are lovely,
of course.

1217
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:05,658
But nothing says
perfection like white.

1218
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:09,729
I was hoping
you'd find your way here.

1219
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:13,833
There are so many things
we should discuss.

1220
01:41:18,605 --> 01:41:22,308
But I have a feeling
your visit will be brief,

1221
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:23,476
so first things first.

1222
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:34,153
I wanted to tell you

1223
01:41:34,155 --> 01:41:36,689
how very sorry I am
about your sister.

1224
01:41:38,492 --> 01:41:42,695
So wasteful. So unnecessary.

1225
01:41:42,697 --> 01:41:46,232
Anyone could see the game
was over by that point.

1226
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:48,701
In fact, I was just about to
issue an official surrender

1227
01:41:48,703 --> 01:41:51,237
when they released
those parachutes.

1228
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:53,339
You released
those parachutes.

1229
01:41:53,341 --> 01:41:55,708
You really think
i gave the order?

1230
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,777
We both know I'm not
above killing children.

1231
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:01,380
But I'm not wasteful.

1232
01:42:01,382 --> 01:42:04,717
I take life
for specific reasons.

1233
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,752
And there was no reason
for me to destroy

1234
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:08,788
a pen full of
capitol children.

1235
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:10,423
None at all.

1236
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:17,897
I must concede,

1237
01:42:17,899 --> 01:42:20,766
it was a masterful move
on coin's part.

1238
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:24,470
The idea that I was bombing

1239
01:42:24,472 --> 01:42:27,673
our own helpless children
to hold back the rebels...

1240
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,611
It turned the last of
my guards against me.

1241
01:42:31,613 --> 01:42:33,346
There was no resistance left

1242
01:42:33,348 --> 01:42:35,314
inside the capitol
or the mansion.

1243
01:42:36,683 --> 01:42:39,285
Do you know it aired live?

1244
01:42:42,256 --> 01:42:45,424
There's a particular savvy
in that, isn't there?

1245
01:42:49,596 --> 01:42:52,632
I'm sure she wasn't
gunning for your sister,

1246
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:56,235
but these things
happen in war.

1247
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:03,509
My failure was in being so
slow to grasp coin's plan.

1248
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:06,512
She let the capitol
and the districts

1249
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:08,614
destroy one another.

1250
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:12,451
Then she stepped in to
take power with 13's arsenal.

1251
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:16,789
Oh, make no mistake,

1252
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:18,791
she intends to
take my place now.

1253
01:43:20,794 --> 01:43:23,629
But I've been watching you.

1254
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:27,233
And you watching me.

1255
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:31,304
I'm afraid we've both
been played for fools.

1256
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:36,442
I don't believe you.

1257
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:40,947
Oh, my dear miss everdeen.

1258
01:43:40,949 --> 01:43:45,251
I thought we'd agreed
never to lie to each other.

1259
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:04,604
President coin asked for you.

1260
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:07,540
You never came to see me.

1261
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:12,912
I wanted to, but...

1262
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:13,946
Was it ours?

1263
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:16,716
The bomb.

1264
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:20,319
The delayed explosion.

1265
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:23,389
The trap.

1266
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:27,393
To draw more people in.

1267
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:31,664
Was that you?

1268
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:35,635
I don't know.

1269
01:44:36,803 --> 01:44:39,905
All I know is

1270
01:44:39,907 --> 01:44:41,874
that I was supposed to
take care of your family.

1271
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:48,781
Now I'm sorry I couldn't.

1272
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:55,354
You can't protect
anyone in an arena.

1273
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:14,006
Goodbye, Gale.

1274
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:32,992
What's this?

1275
01:45:32,994 --> 01:45:34,093
The remaining Victors.

1276
01:45:34,095 --> 01:45:35,461
Won't you join us?

1277
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,476
I have invited you all here
for several reasons,

1278
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,712
but first,
i have an announcement.

1279
01:45:52,714 --> 01:45:55,915
I have taken the burden
and the honor

1280
01:45:55,917 --> 01:45:58,851
of declaring myself
interim president of panem.

1281
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:06,392
Interim? Exactly how long
is that interim?

1282
01:46:06,394 --> 01:46:09,628
We have no way
of knowing for certain.

1283
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:12,098
But it's clear
that people are far too
emotional right now

1284
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:14,600
to make a rational decision.

1285
01:46:14,602 --> 01:46:17,603
We'll plan an election
when the time is right.

1286
01:46:17,605 --> 01:46:21,607
But I have called you here
for a far more important vote.

1287
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:24,710
A symbolic vote.

1288
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:27,546
This afternoon,
we will execute snow.

1289
01:46:29,683 --> 01:46:32,618
Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.

1290
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:37,490
Capitol officials,
peacekeepers, torturers,
gamemakers.

1291
01:46:37,492 --> 01:46:39,592
But the danger is,
once we begin,

1292
01:46:39,594 --> 01:46:42,795
the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.

1293
01:46:42,797 --> 01:46:45,664
Thirst for blood is
a difficult urge to satisfy.

1294
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:51,103
So I offer
an alternative plan.

1295
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:53,739
Majority of four
may approve it.

1296
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:54,974
No one may abstain.

1297
01:46:56,476 --> 01:46:58,844
The proposal is this.

1298
01:46:58,846 --> 01:47:03,015
In lieu of these
barbaric executions,

1299
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:07,186
we hold
a symbolic hunger games.

1300
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:20,499
You wanna have
another hunger games

1301
01:47:20,501 --> 01:47:22,535
with the capitol's children?

1302
01:47:23,837 --> 01:47:25,104
You're joking?

1303
01:47:25,106 --> 01:47:27,506
Not in the slightest.

1304
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:29,542
Is this plutarch's idea?

1305
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:31,477
It was mine.

1306
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:36,615
It balances the need
for revenge

1307
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:38,684
with the least loss
of human life.

1308
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:41,954
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

1309
01:47:43,757 --> 01:47:45,858
No, obviously not.
This is crazy.

1310
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,160
I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.

1311
01:47:48,162 --> 01:47:49,762
I say "yes."

1312
01:47:49,764 --> 01:47:52,465
So do I.
Let them have a taste of it.

1313
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:53,866
You guys,
this way of thinking

1314
01:47:53,868 --> 01:47:55,468
is what started
these uprisings.

1315
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:59,138
I vote "no." With peeta.

1316
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,639
So would finnick,
if he were here.

1317
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:01,941
Well, he's not.

1318
01:48:01,943 --> 01:48:03,609
Because snow killed him.
No.

1319
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:08,247
We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.

1320
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:12,518
It's down to katniss
and haymitch.

1321
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:20,159
I get to kill snow.

1322
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:23,562
I expected
no less of you.

1323
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:31,103
Then I vote "yes."

1324
01:48:33,607 --> 01:48:34,640
For prim.

1325
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:38,878
Haymitch?

1326
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:52,758
I'm with the mockingjay.

1327
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:55,661
That carries the vote.

1328
01:48:56,763 --> 01:48:58,297
Excellent.

1329
01:48:58,299 --> 01:49:00,733
We'll announce
the games tonight,
after the execution.

1330
01:49:02,802 --> 01:49:07,106
Well, it's bound to be
quite the show.

1331
01:49:12,812 --> 01:49:15,114
Oh, you look lovely as ever.

1332
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:17,983
Just beautiful.

1333
01:49:20,654 --> 01:49:22,221
Finishing touches.

1334
01:50:46,106 --> 01:50:49,108
Welcome to the new panem.

1335
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:53,979
Today,
on the Avenue of the tributes,

1336
01:50:54,814 --> 01:50:59,251
all of panem, a free panem,

1337
01:50:59,253 --> 01:51:02,221
will watch more than
a mere spectacle.

1338
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:06,992
We are gathered to witness

1339
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:10,929
an historic moment of justice.

1340
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:15,067
Today, the greatest friend
to the revolution

1341
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:19,038
will fire the shot
to end all wars.

1342
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:24,109
May her arrow
signify the end of tyranny

1343
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:29,148
and the beginning
of a new era.

1344
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:32,151
Mockingjay,

1345
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:37,890
may your aim be as true

1346
01:51:37,892 --> 01:51:42,161
as your heart is pure.

1347
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:31,944
No!

1348
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:34,113
No!

1349
01:52:34,115 --> 01:52:36,248
Kill him!

1350
01:52:39,786 --> 01:52:41,520
Kill him! Kill him now!

1351
01:52:45,525 --> 01:52:46,325
Kill him!

1352
01:53:59,033 --> 01:54:00,999
I'll say this for you,
katniss.

1353
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:03,335
You don't disappoint.

1354
01:54:06,306 --> 01:54:09,408
Well, plutarch
gave me a letter for you.

1355
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:10,275
I don't want it.

1356
01:54:11,377 --> 01:54:13,011
You never make it easy,
do you?

1357
01:54:15,215 --> 01:54:17,916
Okay. I'll read it for you.

1358
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:21,320
"Katniss,

1359
01:54:21,322 --> 01:54:23,555
"maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,

1360
01:54:23,557 --> 01:54:26,225
"but once again, I was not.

1361
01:54:26,227 --> 01:54:29,928
"You were exactly
who I believed you were.

1362
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:31,530
"I wish I could give you
a proper goodbye.

1363
01:54:31,532 --> 01:54:33,565
"But with both coin
and snow dead,

1364
01:54:33,567 --> 01:54:35,901
"the fate of the country
will be decided tonight,

1365
01:54:35,903 --> 01:54:37,236
"and I can't be seen
at your side.

1366
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:40,439
"Tonight,
the 12 district leaders

1367
01:54:40,441 --> 01:54:43,075
"will call
for a free election.

1368
01:54:43,077 --> 01:54:45,177
"There's little doubt
that paylor will carry it.

1369
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:46,411
"She's become
the voice of reason.

1370
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,949
"I'm sorry so much
burden fell on you.

1371
01:54:50,951 --> 01:54:54,219
"I know
you'll never escape it.

1372
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:55,621
"But if I had to
put you through it again

1373
01:54:55,623 --> 01:54:58,423
"for this outcome, I would.

1374
01:55:01,427 --> 01:55:04,029
"The war's over.
We'll enter that sweet period

1375
01:55:04,031 --> 01:55:05,230
"where everyone agrees

1376
01:55:05,232 --> 01:55:07,132
"not to repeat
the recent horrors.

1377
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:10,002
"Of course, we're fickle

1378
01:55:10,004 --> 01:55:12,204
"stupid beings,
with poor memories

1379
01:55:12,206 --> 01:55:14,439
"and a great gift
for self-destruction.

1380
01:55:16,643 --> 01:55:21,213
"Although, who knows?
Maybe this time, we'll learn.

1381
01:55:21,215 --> 01:55:24,316
"I've secured you a ride
out of the capitol.

1382
01:55:24,318 --> 01:55:26,018
"It's better for you
to be out of sight.

1383
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:27,219
"And when the time is right,

1384
01:55:27,221 --> 01:55:28,587
"commander paylor
will pardon you.

1385
01:55:30,189 --> 01:55:31,590
"The country
will find its peace.

1386
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:34,259
"And I hope
you can find yours.

1387
01:55:35,194 --> 01:55:36,261
"Plutarch."

1388
01:55:39,532 --> 01:55:40,666
What now?

1389
01:55:42,635 --> 01:55:43,502
Home.

1390
01:55:45,004 --> 01:55:46,238
We go home.

1391
01:55:52,145 --> 01:55:54,513
I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.

1392
01:56:01,087 --> 01:56:02,587
It's your job to take care
of yourself now, katniss.

1393
01:56:07,126 --> 01:56:08,627
Promise me you'll find it.

1394
01:56:10,263 --> 01:56:11,463
Find what?

1395
01:56:13,132 --> 01:56:14,733
The life of a Victor.

1396
01:56:17,403 --> 01:56:19,604
Goodbye, effie.
Goodbye, my girl.

1397
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:26,244
Effie, don't be a stranger.

1398
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:32,351
Take care of her.

1399
01:56:32,353 --> 01:56:33,452
I will.

1400
01:58:05,278 --> 01:58:06,478
She's gone.

1401
01:58:14,487 --> 01:58:16,088
Get out!

1402
01:58:18,724 --> 01:58:21,660
Get out! Prim is gone!

1403
01:58:21,662 --> 01:58:23,728
Prim is gone!

1404
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:26,465
She's dead!
And she's not coming back!

1405
01:58:26,467 --> 01:58:28,633
Get out! Get out!

1406
02:00:02,728 --> 02:00:03,595
Peeta?

1407
02:00:07,934 --> 02:00:08,900
Hey.

1408
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:11,970
You came home.

1409
02:00:13,673 --> 02:00:14,606
Yeah.

1410
02:00:21,447 --> 02:00:24,349
I found these, uh,
out by the edge of the forest.

1411
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:29,588
It's a primrose.

1412
02:00:43,302 --> 02:00:44,569
So sorry, katniss.

1413
02:00:53,312 --> 02:00:55,614
"You'll be happy to hear
that katniss' mother

1414
02:00:55,616 --> 02:00:58,016
"has been training new medical
units in the capitol.

1415
02:00:58,018 --> 02:01:00,685
"Gale has been promoted
to a captain in district 2

1416
02:01:00,687 --> 02:01:03,021
"to help keep order
and security.

1417
02:01:03,023 --> 02:01:05,457
"And I am loving
every moment with my son

1418
02:01:05,459 --> 02:01:08,026
"who reminds me every day
of his father.

1419
02:01:08,028 --> 02:01:09,894
"We've all suffered so much.

1420
02:01:09,896 --> 02:01:11,997
"But we owe it
to their memories

1421
02:01:11,999 --> 02:01:15,934
"and to our children to do
our best with these lives.

1422
02:01:15,936 --> 02:01:18,703
"I hope you're both
finding some peace.

1423
02:01:18,705 --> 02:01:19,604
"Annie."

1424
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:31,783
 I solemnly swear

1425
02:01:31,785 --> 02:01:35,754
 to the best of my ability,
 to preserve, protect,

1426
02:01:35,756 --> 02:01:39,391
 and uphold the rights
 of every citizen of panem.

1427
02:01:39,393 --> 02:01:42,427
There's plutarch,
right in the middle of it all.

1428
02:01:42,429 --> 02:01:44,429
And they say
no one ever wins the games.

1429
02:03:04,443 --> 02:03:05,543
You love me.

1430
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:08,813
Real or not real?

1431
02:03:11,851 --> 02:03:12,851
Real.

1432
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:00,698
Oh.

1433
02:04:08,974 --> 02:04:10,442
Did you
have a nightmare?

1434
02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:14,179
I have nightmares, too.

1435
02:04:20,986 --> 02:04:22,854
Someday
I'll explain it to you.

1436
02:04:24,523 --> 02:04:25,990
Why they came,

1437
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:28,993
why they won't ever go away.

1438
02:04:37,102 --> 02:04:38,937
But I'll tell you
how I survive it.

1439
02:04:41,106 --> 02:04:44,075
I make a list in my head

1440
02:04:44,077 --> 02:04:46,244
of all the good things
I've seen someone do.

1441
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:49,781
Every little thing
i can remember.

1442
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:55,186
It's like a game.

1443
02:04:56,222 --> 02:04:58,189
I do it over and over.

1444
02:05:01,026 --> 02:05:03,661
Gets a little tedious
after all these years,

1445
02:05:06,232 --> 02:05:08,566
but there are
much worse games to play.
