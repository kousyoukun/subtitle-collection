1
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,347
5,6,7,8

2
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,827
Anybody seen the Kelly Sisters?

3
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,662
You, you're up in five

4
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,630
- Keep the change, Charlie
- Thanks

5
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:37,525
Where the hell have you been?

6
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:40,269
- And where is Veronica?
- She's onto herself tonight.

7
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,270
But they paid to see your sister act

8
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,908
Don't sweat it, I can do it alone

9
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:04,163
Shit!

10
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,325
Come on, move it, move it
Hurry up

11
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:19,835
Tell them you're here

12
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:23,115
Ladies and gentlemen

13
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:27,597
The Onyx Club is proud to present
Chicago's hottest dancing duo

14
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:32,616
Two jazz babes moving as one

15
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:35,619
The Kelly Sisters

16
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:53,237
Come on babe
Why don't we paint the town

17
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,508
In all that Jazz
I'm gonna rouge my knees

18
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,116
and roll my stockings down

19
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:05,530
And all that jazz
Start the car

20
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,727
I know a whoopee spot

21
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,474
where the gin is cold

22
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,655
but the piano's hot

23
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:15,799
It's just a noisy hall
where there's a nightly brawl

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,058
And all...

25
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,577
...that...

26
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:23,997
Jazz

27
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:24,996
Skidoo

28
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:28,218
And all that Jazz

29
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,421
Hotcha!

30
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,325
Whoopee!

31
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:36,266
And all that Jazz

32
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:03,231
Slick you hair
Wear your buckle shoes

33
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,021
And all that Jazz

34
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:06,552
I hear the father dip

35
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:10,869
Is gonna blow the blues

36
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,894
And all that Jazz

37
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:15,587
Hold on, hon
We're gonna bunny hug

38
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,546
I bought some aspirin

39
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:19,399
Down at United Drug

40
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,179
In case you shake apart

41
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,199
And wanna a brand new start

42
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,035
to do

43
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,193
that

44
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:30,460
Jazz

45
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,462
Let's go baby

46
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:34,656
But I didn't even meet your friend

47
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:35,813
That, that manager guy

48
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,399
Don't worry, Roxy

49
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,053
It's all taken care of

50
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,160
You told him about me

51
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,958
Yeah, kid
It's all arranged

52
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,964
Find a flask
We're playing fast and loose

53
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,893
And all that Jazz

54
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:54,897
Right up here is where I store the juice

55
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:56,904
And all that Jazz

56
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,715
Come on babe
We're gonna brush the sky

57
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,366
I bet you lucky Lindy

58
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,008
Never flew so high

59
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,769
'Cause in the stratosphere

60
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,730
How could he lend an ear

61
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,939
To all...

62
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,776
...that...

63
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,640
Jazz

64
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,066
Oh, you're gonna see her sheba shimmy shake

65
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,321
And All That Jazz!

66
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,600
Oh, she's gonna shimmy till her garters break

67
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,278
And All That Jazz

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,507
Show her where to park her girdle

69
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:34,778
Oh, her mother's blood is curdle

70
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:35,841
If she'd hear

71
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:37,483
Her baby's queer

72
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:42,489
For All That Jazz!

73
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,895
Oh, Mrs. Brucewits
Mrs. Hart

74
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,746
This is Fred

75
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:57,749
He's my brother

76
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,324
All that Jazz

77
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,413
Come on babe,
why don't we paint the town?

78
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,449
And all that Jazz

79
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,187
I'm gonna rouge my knees

80
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:17,984
and roll my stockings down

81
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:21,791
And all that Jazz

82
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,653
Start the car

83
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:24,720
I know a whoopee spot

84
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,014
Where martini is cold

85
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:28,062
But the piano's hot

86
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,452
It's just a noisy hall

87
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,482
Where there's a nightly brawl

88
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:36,488
And all that Jazz

89
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:38,956
Say it again, Fred

90
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:40,769
Ah, you're the star, kid

91
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:45,321
My little shooting star

92
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,487
No, I'm no one's wife

93
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,823
But, oh, I love my life

94
00:06:50,824 --> 00:07:01,834
And All That Jazz!

95
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,206
That Jazz

96
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:11,503
Oh, say it again, Fred

97
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:12,704
Jesus

98
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,018
Where is the fire?

99
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:22,019
Amos ain't home till midnight

100
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,266
Freddie

101
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:27,617
Fred

102
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,150
Hey, ...you know

103
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:38,364
I don't want you to feel
I'm nagging at you or anything

104
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:41,516
But don't think it's about time
that I met your friend out of the Onyx

105
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,529
I mean it's been a month since you told him about me

106
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,142
I know

107
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:55,147
Cause that was a night Velma Kelly
plugged her husband and her sister

108
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,198
You really say that she found when they kissed together

109
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,204
Gosh if I found Amos soping it into somebody else

110
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,048
Bing bing gone with the wind, right

111
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,736
It's getting late

112
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,932
I have been thinking a lot about mattress

113
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:14,757
I never get a really good idea
I write it down in my diary before it goes out of my head

114
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,267
And it occured to me the other day

115
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:21,052
That all the really, really knocked out acts

116
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:24,179
Have, you know, something little different
going on you know

117
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:27,182
Like eh...our signature bed

118
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,413
And I thought, I thought that nothing

119
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:32,765
Could be a loof

120
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,967
You know

121
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,918
Give them just enough to get them good in hungry
you know

122
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,120
Always leave them one more

123
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,656
Hey, once I get a name for myself

124
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,545
Maybe, maybe we could
open up a club in Varum, you know

125
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,462
You could run it

126
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:50,465
and I could be the headliner

127
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,097
What's the idea?

128
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,116
Wake up, kid, you're never gonna have an act

129
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,117
Says who?

130
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:57,935
Face it, Roxie

131
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,127
You're too bit talent with skinny legs

132
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,983
but I'm just a furniture salesman

133
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,192
Dear but you got connections, you know

134
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,509
The guy down the club

135
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,643
There is no guy

136
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,886
Yet, that night

137
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,551
It was the first night I set foot in that joint

138
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:12,684
I was collecting out a bed for the trumbone player

139
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,687
So you never told anyone about me?

140
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:18,452
Sugar, you are hot stuff

141
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:22,421
I would say anything to get a piece of that

142
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,421
And now, now?

143
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:27,429
We've had some laughs
Let's just leave it with that

144
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,532
Fred

145
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,947
You can't do this to me

146
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:36,415
You get off!

147
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:42,655
You touch me again,
I'll put your lights out

148
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,541
Wait

149
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,594
Your husband will be home,
so why don't you watch yourself

150
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,894
We ain't gonna hit no sheets again

151
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,468
You're a liar, Fred

152
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,201
Oh yes, so what?

153
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,203
You lied to me

154
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,090
- You lied to me
- That's right, sweetheart, that's right

155
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,330
Son of bitch

156
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,334
You're son of a bitch

157
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,581
You're son of a bitch

158
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:20,188
Hotcha

159
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,234
Whoopee

160
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:26,649
Why you're bothering, Sal

161
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,469
This one's all wrapped up

162
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:29,966
I hear it's a new city record

163
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,990
from killing to confession in an hour for that

164
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,642
Where did you get the murder weapon?

165
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:36,723
I keep a gun in the underwear drawer

166
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:39,356
Just in case of trouble, you know

167
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,911
That's just fine, sign right there, Mr. Hart

168
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,510
Freely and gladly

169
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,613
Freely and gladly

170
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,969
And mind that you don't say we beat you up
when you get upon the witness stand

171
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,310
No I gave myself up,
surrendered at my own freewill

172
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,937
Isn't he the cheerful murderer?

173
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,609
Shooting a burgalar ain't murder

174
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,643
Just last week the jury sancted a man

175
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:58,268
I'm always greatful for citizens the law

176
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,270
Get in there

177
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,434
You too

178
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:05,153
Sit down

179
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
OK, from the top

180
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,955
A man's got a right to protect his home
and his loved ones, right?

181
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,680
Of course he has

182
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:18,535
Well I come home from the garage,
I see him climbing through the window

183
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:19,735
Aha?

184
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:22,925
With my wife Roxie in there
sleeping like an angel

185
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,195
Is that true, Mrs. Hart?

186
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:27,515
I'm telling you
My wife has nothing to do with it

187
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,151
She wouldn't hurt a worm
Not even a worm

188
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:33,946
Was until I fire the first shot
She won't even open her eyes

189
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:35,089
She sleeping

190
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,537
I would say she could sleep to the saint patty's day parade

191
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,338
When I think what would happen
if I went out for a beer with the guys

192
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,476
instead of coming straight home

193
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:46,474
It makes you sick when you think about it

194
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:51,632
For her first number, Ms. Roxie Hart
would like to sing a song of love and devotion

195
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,983
Dedicated to her dear husband Amos

196
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,542
Sometimes I'm right

197
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,555
Sometimes I'm wrong

198
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,783
But he doesn't care

199
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:09,158
He'll string along

200
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,580
He loves me so

201
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,576
That funny honey of mine!

202
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,887
Sometimes I'm down

203
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,360
Sometimes I'm up

204
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:27,849
But he follows 'round

205
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:32,223
Like some droopy-eyed pup

206
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:35,569
He loves me so

207
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,721
That funny honey of mine!

208
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:39,422
Like I said

209
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,338
Even after I shot him,  he kept coming at me

210
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,504
So I had to pull the trigger again

211
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:46,212
He ain't no sheik

212
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,418
That's no great physique

213
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:53,415
And Lord knows he ain't got the smarts

214
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,957
But look at that soul

215
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,184
I tell you, that whole

216
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:02,211
Is a whole lot greater

217
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:07,208
Than the sum of his parts

218
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:12,825
And if you knew him like me

219
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:18,658
I know you'd agree

220
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,181
What if the world

221
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:24,157
Slander my name?

222
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,322
Why, he'd be right there

223
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:31,027
Taking the blame

224
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,998
He loves me so

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,996
And it all suits me fine

226
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:45,922
That funny, sunny, honey

227
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,462
Hubby of mine!

228
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,771
I mean supposin', just supposin'

229
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:53,667
He'd violated her or something

230
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,795
- You know what I mean? Violated
- I know what you mean

231
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,664
Or something, think how terrible that would've been

232
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:00,550
It's a good thing I got home from work on time

233
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:03,026
I'm tellin' you that

234
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:06,973
I say I' m telling you that

235
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:08,682
Name of deceased...Fred Casely

236
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,599
Fred Casely?

237
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,349
How could he be a burglar?
My wife knows him!

238
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,257
He sold us our furniture!

239
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,909
He gave us ten percent off

240
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:21,191
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts

241
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,473
She told me he was a burglar.

242
00:14:22,474 --> 00:14:24,081
You mean he was dead when you got home?

243
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:25,384
She had him covered with a sheet

244
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,403
and she's tellin' me some cock
and bull story about this burglar

245
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:31,584
and I ought to say I did
it 'cause I was sure to get off

246
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,869
"Help me, Amos" she says
it's my god damn hour of needs

247
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,742
Now, he shot off his trap

248
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,984
I can't stand that sap

249
00:14:39,986 --> 00:14:41,586
(Amos) And I believed her!
(Roxie) Look at him go

250
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,211
(Amos) That cheap little tramp.
(Roxie) Rattin' on me

251
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:49,209
(Amos) So she was two-timing me, huh?
(Roxie) With just one more brain

252
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:53,217
(Amos) Boy, I'm down at the garage, working my butt off fourteen hours a day
(Roxie) If they string me up

253
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,408
And she's up there munchin' on bon-bons

254
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:58,399
And trampling around like a goddamn fruisy

255
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,228
She thought she could

256
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,163
I wasn't born yet

257
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:03,161
I tell you there's something a man just can't take

258
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:05,971
And this time she pushed me too far

259
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:07,737
That little chiseler

260
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:10,735
Boy, what a sap I was

261
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:15,390
You double-crosser, you big blover  mouth!
You promised you'd say...

262
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:17,934
What're you talking about,
you've been tricking me, Roxanne

263
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,192
You told me he was a burglar

264
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:21,236
The whole time you're been jazzling

265
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,235
You are a disloyal husband

266
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,827
Look, it's true
I shot him. But...

267
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,382
It was out of defense
He was trying to burgle me

268
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:36,698
And what I hear is he's been
burgling you three times a week for the last month

269
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,222
So what do you say, Mrs?

270
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,793
- That's him alright
- Thank you

271
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:44,028
Your story doesn' wash, Mrs Hart

272
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,772
So try this emphasize

273
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:48,931
Fred Caseley was a good time on the side
with goofy here's a milk ticket

274
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:52,084
Milk ticket? He could buy my liquor

275
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,315
And Fred Casely could

276
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:58,313
With a wife and  5 little Caseleys
Or did he forget to mention them?

277
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,888
What?

278
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,087
All his

279
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,897
That bastard

280
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,313
Yeah, I killed him, I will kill him again

281
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:13,311
Once was enough, dear,take her to downtown
Come on

282
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:20,217
This way, honey

283
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,349
Oh, come on, it's a shame
to hide such a beautiful face

284
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,644
Why did you shoot him?

285
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,919
Why don't you give a profile,
a little smile like the girl in the toothpaste ad?

286
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,516
That one you can't, take this down

287
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:32,541
District attorney Harrison says this is a hanging case

288
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:35,913
- I'm ready to go to the Jury tomorrow
- What do you mean hanging?

289
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,661
Take her down to the Cook County Jail

290
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:41,659
Come on ,sweetie headliner. Why did you shoot him?
Was he crude, did he beat you, did he fool around..

291
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:45,888
What do you mean hanging?

292
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:06,192
Morphine, opium, cocaine?

293
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,189
Arm length: 31 inches

294
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,269
Arm length: 31 inches

295
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:19,900
The matron's on the way,
so don't ge too cozy

296
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,898
Put off that cigarette

297
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:28,434
Ever had morphine before?

298
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,224
She's fine

299
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:38,991
As long as you keep her happy

300
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,989
And now, ladies and gentlemen

301
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,647
The keeper of the keys,
the countess of the clink

302
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:49,645
The mistress of Murderer's row
Matron "Mama" Morton

303
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:04,804
Ask any of the chickies in my pen

304
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:09,800
They'll tell I'm the biggest mother hen

305
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:15,510
I love 'em all and all of them love me

306
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,321
Because the system works

307
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:22,318
The system called reciprocity

308
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,669
On your feet

309
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,248
Welcome, ladies

310
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:34,410
Got a little motto

311
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:37,463
Always sees me through

312
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:40,059
When you're good to Mama

313
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:42,597
Mama's good to you!

314
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,030
Might think it'll make your life a living hell

315
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,027
Which is just not true

316
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,038
There's a lot of favors

317
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,793
I'm prepared to do

318
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,395
You do one for Mama

319
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:58,041
She'll do one for you

320
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,205
Like to be your friend if you let me

321
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:04,674
So if something upsets you or makes you unhappy
in any way

322
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,551
Don't shoot your fat-ass mouth on me

323
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,019
Cause I don't give a shit, now move it out

324
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,699
They say that life is tit for tat

325
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:13,349
And that's the way I live

326
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,393
So, I deserve a lot of tat

327
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:19,078
For what I've got to give

328
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,977
Don't you know that this hand

329
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:24,827
Washes that one too

330
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,443
When you're good to Mama

331
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:32,439
Mama's good to you!

332
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,645
Let's go

333
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:41,043
You must be Hart

334
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,129
Ain't you a pretty one?

335
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,440
Thank you, madam

336
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,288
Oh no, call me Mama

337
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,936
I'm gonna take care of you

338
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,308
Now you'll be happy taken down in this block

339
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,418
Murderer's Row we call

340
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,416
Is that nicer?

341
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,377
No, I don't think I really belong in here

342
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,333
I didn't actually do anything wrong

343
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:10,299
I need to tell you, honey

344
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,250
I never heard of a man getting killed
when he didn't get just what would come at all

345
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:15,660
Hey, Mama

346
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:17,878
Come here, come here

347
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,877
Velma Kelly?

348
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:23,064
You're the Velma Kelly

349
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,431
You know I was there that night
I was there that night

350
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,390
That you got arrested

351
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,004
Yeah, you and half of Chicago

352
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:30,459
Look at this, Mama

353
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,971
An editorial denouce me in Red Book Magazine

354
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:38,482
Not a memory did we reall so fiendish horrible
a double homicide

355
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,403
Baby, you couldn't buy that kind of publicity

356
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,602
Couldn't buy it?

357
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:46,582
I guess I can keep this then

358
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,591
Let's try

359
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,642
If you want my gravy

360
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,336
Pepper my ragout

361
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,177
Spice it up for Mama

362
00:20:58,178 --> 00:21:03,177
She'll get hot for you

363
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,028
When they pass that basket

364
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,898
Folks contribute to

365
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:13,570
You put in for Mama

366
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:18,571
She'll pull out for you

367
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:23,120
The folks atop the ladder

368
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:25,986
Are the ones the world adores

369
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,933
So boost me up my ladder, kid

370
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:31,936
And I'll boost you up yours

371
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:34,601
Let's all stroke together

372
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:37,400
Like the Princeton crew

373
00:21:37,403 --> 00:21:39,970
When you're strokin' Mama

374
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:43,966
Mama's strokin' you

375
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,898
So what's the one conclusion

376
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,876
I can bring this number to?

377
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:53,646
When you're good to Mama

378
00:21:53,648 --> 00:22:00,946
Mama's good to you

379
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,769
Mama

380
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:14,565
It's kind of freezing in here

381
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,687
You don't think maybe there's something wrong
with the heat

382
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:20,687
Not that I'm complaining, mind you,
but you know

383
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:26,331
If you got a couple of blankets to sleep with

384
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,691
Lights out, ladies

385
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:45,067
OK

386
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:32,519
Pop

387
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,344
Six

388
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:36,592
Squish

389
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:38,742
Uh-Uh

390
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:40,574
Cicero

391
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:42,697
Lipschitz!

392
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,468
And now the six merry murderesses
of the Cook County Jail

393
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:57,468
in their rendition of
the "Cell Block Tango."

394
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:04,701
Pop

395
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:06,598
Six

396
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:08,479
Squish

397
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:10,661
Uh-uh

398
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:12,603
Cicero

399
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,837
Lipschitz

400
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:20,652
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, cicero

401
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:22,495
Lipschitz

402
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:33,907
He had it coming

403
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,754
He had it coming

404
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:39,577
He only had himself to blame

405
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,420
If you'd have been there

406
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:43,379
If you'd have seen it

407
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:46,534
I betcha you would have done the same!

408
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:53,535
Pop, six, squish, uh-uh, cicero, lipschitz

409
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:58,112
You know how people
have these little habits that get you down

410
00:24:58,113 --> 00:25:02,404
Like Bernie.
Bernie liked to chew gum.

411
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,714
No, not chew. Pop.

412
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:08,544
So I came home this one day and
I'm really irritated,

413
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:10,662
I'm looking for a little sympathy

414
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,284
and there's Bernie lyin' on the couch

415
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:15,047
drinkin' a beer and chewin' it

416
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:18,156
No, not chewin'. Poppin'

417
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:23,155
So, I said my six, you pop that gum one more time

418
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:25,674
And he did

419
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,748
So I took the shotgun off the wall

420
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:31,373
and I fired two warning shots

421
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:35,230
into his head

422
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,815
He had it coming

423
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,114
He had it coming

424
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:42,766
He only had himself to blame

425
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:44,629
If you'd have been there

426
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:46,419
If you'd have heard it

427
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:51,420
I betcha you would
have done the same!

428
00:25:56,727 --> 00:26:00,709
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City
about two years ago

429
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,576
and he told me he was single

430
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:04,498
and we hit it off right away.

431
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:06,519
So, we started living together

432
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,649
He'd go to work, he'd come home,

433
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,477
I'd fix him a drink, and we'd have dinner

434
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:14,118
And then I found out

435
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:15,707
"Single" he told me?

436
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,535
Single, my ass

437
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,324
Not only was he married

438
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:20,444
oh no

439
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,473
He had six wives

440
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:25,036
One of those Mormons, you know

441
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:27,717
So that night when he came home from work

442
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:32,118
I fixed him his drink as usual

443
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:36,384
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

444
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,950
He had it coming

445
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,087
He had it coming

446
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:43,801
He took a flower in its prime

447
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,069
And then he used it

448
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,539
And he abused it

449
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,167
It was a murder
But not a crime

450
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,963
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen

451
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,791
carvin' up the chicken for dinner

452
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,538
minding my own business

453
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,734
In storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage

454
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:02,723
"You been screwin' the milkman," he says

455
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:03,933
He was crazy

456
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:07,428
and he kept on screamin'
"You been screwin' the milkman,"

457
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,970
And then he ran into my knife!

458
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,969
He ran into my knife ten times

459
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:16,970
If you'd have been there

460
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:18,860
If you'd have seen it

461
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:22,718
I betcha you would have done the same

462
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:27,349
Mit keresek, enn itt? Azt mondjok, hogy lakem lefogta a ferjemet

463
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:30,066
en meg lecsaptam a fejet.

464
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:33,811
De nem igaz, en artatlan vagyok

465
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:38,721
Nem tudom mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tetten

466
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:43,722
Probaltam a rendorsegen
megmagyarazni de nem ertettek meg

467
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:45,657
Yeah, but did you do it

468
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,352
Ah ah, not guilty

469
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:53,385
He had it coming

470
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:56,165
My sister, Veronica, and I did this double act

471
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:59,193
and my husband, Charlie, traveled around with us

472
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:00,612
Now for the last number in our act

473
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,789
we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row

474
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:05,225
one, two, three, four, five

475
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:07,947
Splits, spread eagles, back flips, flip flops

476
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:09,685
One right after the other

477
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:13,424
So this one night before the show
we are down at the Hotel Cicero

478
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:17,741
the three of us boozin' , havin' a few laughs

479
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:19,124
and we run out of ice

480
00:28:19,126 --> 00:28:21,539
so I go out to get some

481
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:24,639
I come back, open the door

482
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:29,676
And there's Veronica and Charlie
doing Number Seventeen

483
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:32,219
the spread eagle

484
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,720
Well, I was in such a state of shock

485
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:35,971
I completely blacked out

486
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:38,289
I can't remember a thing

487
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:42,535
It wasn't until later, when I was
washing the blood off my hands

488
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,793
I even knew they were dead

489
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,480
They had it coming

490
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:48,129
They had it coming

491
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,176
They had it coming all along

492
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,880
I didn't do it

493
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:55,832
But if I'd done it

494
00:28:55,833 --> 00:29:00,832
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

495
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,636
They had it coming

496
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:05,189
They had it coming

497
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,801
They had it coming all along

498
00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:10,779
I didn't do it

499
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,406
But if I'd done it

500
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:16,974
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

501
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:20,088
I love Alvin Lipschitz
More than I can possibly say

502
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,029
He was a real artistic guy

503
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:24,950
Sensitive...a painter

504
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:27,433
But he was always trying to find himself

505
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,012
He'd go out every night
looking for himself and along the way

506
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:36,014
he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

507
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:38,555
I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences

508
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:44,931
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

509
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,629
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

510
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,213
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

511
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:54,046
They had it comin'

512
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,797
They had it comin'

513
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,847
They had it comin' all along

514
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,337
'Cause if they used us

515
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,567
And they abused us

516
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,821
How could you tell us
That we were wrong?

517
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,706
He had it coming

518
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,510
He had it coming

519
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:14,119
He only had himself to blame

520
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,912
If you'd have been there

521
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,750
If you'd have seen it

522
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:20,549
I betcha you would have done the same

523
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,596
- You pop that gum one more time
- Single my ass
- Ten times

524
00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:27,677
-Miert csukott Uncle Sam bortonbe.
- Number Seventeen - the spread eagle.
- Artistic differences

525
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,479
Pop

526
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:30,472
Six

527
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:32,654
Squish

528
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:34,802
Uh-uh

529
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:36,571
Cicero

530
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,526
Lipschitz

531
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:47,408
Who brought them?

532
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,348
What's up to you?

533
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,348
Nothing

534
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:50,857
Heard they're Velma's

535
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:56,542
Yeah, Hanja does all her laundry for a couple of weeks

536
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:10,100
- Fresh towels for change
- Make it quick

537
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,058
I can take good care of you

538
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,398
There're a couple of things
Let me analyze to you

539
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,758
Now, Billy Flynn set your trial date
on Mar 5th

540
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:19,924
Mar 7th you would be aquitted

541
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,677
On Mar 8th, you know what Mama's
gonna do for you?

542
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,632
Mama's gonna put you back
in Veaudeville Circus

543
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,805
So now you're an agent too?

544
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:31,342
Well them until Mabelle install a private line in your cell
All calls gotta go through me

545
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:33,147
What kind of dough we're talking about?

546
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,786
You know, this crazy world

547
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:38,884
I mean, Babe Ruth is wearing rules
and playing in palace for 5000 dollars for a week

548
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:41,203
Yeah, what about someone with real talent

549
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,311
Well, I can talk to the boys over Wienworks

550
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:46,270
With your recent sensation activities

551
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,395
They seem they can give you 2500

552
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:49,394
2500?

553
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,634
Geez, the most me and Veronica make was 350

554
00:31:52,637 --> 00:31:55,007
Yeah, that was what happens
when you have that Redbook presentation

555
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,300
You know what, Mama?

556
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:59,318
I always wanted to play Big Jim

557
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,787
Do you think you can get me that?

558
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,775
Big Jim's?

559
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:04,063
I don't know

560
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:05,269
It's gonna take another phone call

561
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,625
How much is that gonna cost?

562
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:08,826
Come on Vel

563
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:13,089
I feel about you, you're like family of me
You're one of my own

564
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,921
- I'll do for fifty bucks
- Fifty bucks for a phone call?

565
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:21,921
You must get a lot of wrong numbers, Mama

566
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:27,548
Oh, Ms. Kelly, got your personals

567
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,335
Freshly pressed by yours truly

568
00:32:29,337 --> 00:32:32,335
I know, it's my pleasure

569
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,283
Hey, listen

570
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,282
Can I ask you something?

571
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,431
You know that Harrison guy?

572
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:40,548
Well he said what I have done is a hanging case

573
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,548
And he's prepared to ask for the maximum penalty

574
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:44,842
Yeah, so?

575
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:47,016
So I'm scared

576
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:49,666
I surely would appreciate some advice

577
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,267
Especially from...

578
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,425
Someone I admire as much as you

579
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:55,878
Since I can remember, I have wanted to be on the stage

580
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:56,972
Really?

581
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,120
What's your talent, washing and drying?

582
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,374
No, no

583
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,951
I dance in the chorus

584
00:33:02,953 --> 00:33:04,262
That was before I met my husband Amos

585
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:06,253
Look, you want some advice?

586
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:08,253
Here it is, direct from me to you

587
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,728
Keep your paws off my underwear. OK?

588
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:17,581
Yeah, OK

589
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,481
Thanks

590
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:21,989
For nothing

591
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,319
She's not that nice, ain't she?

592
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,540
I'll tell you no matter how big she gives,
she's still as common as ever

593
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,539
I'd like to help you, deary

594
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:35,487
We'll take a lotto

595
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:39,506
So what do you figure on useful ground?

596
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:40,729
Grounds?

597
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,077
What're you gonna tell the jury?

598
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:44,001
Who's figure, I'll tell them the truth

599
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:45,001
The truth?

600
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,547
That's one way ticket to the death house

601
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,014
Holy mother of God

602
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:50,014
Oh relax

603
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,127
I mean, in this town
Murders are for entertainment

604
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:56,364
Besides, in 47 years,
the Cook County never hung a woman yet

605
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,235
So that's 47 to 1

606
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,512
that they won't hang you

607
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:02,216
Jesus, Mary and Joseph

608
00:34:02,217 --> 00:34:04,103
You're talking to the wrong people

609
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:06,362
What you need is Billy Flynn

610
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:07,362
Who?

611
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:08,670
Billy Flynn

612
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:11,796
He's only the best criminal lawyer in all over Illinois

613
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:13,934
Tell me what he don't know
about juries and women

614
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:15,542
How do you get this Billy Flynn?

615
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,438
Well, not by prayer, deary

616
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,165
First you give me a hundred dollars

617
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,270
Then I'll make a phone call

618
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,963
Hundred dollars? Well it just...

619
00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:23,962
I mean

620
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:26,211
Seems pretty steep for a phone call

621
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:28,543
Oh but it worth every cent

622
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:31,925
I mean he never lost a case for female clients yet

623
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,191
Or a sweet puss like you as well

624
00:34:35,194 --> 00:34:37,656
Let's just say it seems so blind in Chicago

625
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:38,856
He's never lost a case?

626
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:40,423
Never

627
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:45,424
Every girl in this place would kill
to have Billy Flynn represent her

628
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:53,902
We want Billy

629
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,617
B. I. Double L. Y.

630
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:07,475
We're all his

631
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:14,336
He's our kind of a guy

632
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:19,417
And ooh what luck

633
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,418
'Cause here he is

634
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:30,863
Ladies and Gentleman, presenting
the Silver-Tongued Prince of the Courtroom

635
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:34,863
the one, the only Billy Flynn

636
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,455
I don't care about expensive things

637
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:49,095
Cashmere coats, diamond rings

638
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,490
Don't mean a thing

639
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:54,765
All I care about is love

640
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,906
(Billy) That's what I'm here for
(Girls) That's what he's here for

641
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:59,802
I don't care for wearing silk cravats

642
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:03,369
Ruby studs, satin spats

643
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,879
Don't mean a thing

644
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,793
All I care about is love

645
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:10,788
All he cares about is love

646
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:14,204
Give me two eyes of blue

647
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,742
Softly saying, "I need you"

648
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:21,118
Let me see her standin' there

649
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,117
And honest, mister, I'm a millionaire

650
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:35,973
I don't care for any fine attire

651
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:39,327
Vanderbilt might admire

652
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:41,575
No, no, not me

653
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,724
All I care about is love

654
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:48,723
All he cares about is love

655
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,110
Good morning, ladies

656
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:03,290
That's what he's here for

657
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:05,726
Excuse me, gentlemen

658
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,526
Ms. Kelly, do you remember anything
at all about that night

659
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,527
I passed out completely, Ms. Sunshine
I can' t remember a thing

660
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,943
Only that I didn't do it

661
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:14,867
- Any idea who did it?
- No

662
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:18,796
No but my client is offering a substantial award
to anyone with information about this crime

663
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,237
How much is the reward, Ms. Kelly?

664
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,427
I don't know, how much?

665
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:23,325
I'll work it out after the trial

666
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,325
Now, if there's no more questions, Ms. Kelly and I
had a lot work to do

667
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,733
What's all this about the awards?

668
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:34,653
Often done before. If the reporters write it on
we deny the whole thing later on

669
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,653
Thank you

670
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,178
All he cares about is love

671
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,772
- Mr. Flynn, I'm Roxie...Hart
- Who?

672
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:45,747
- Mama tells you about me
- Oh, yeah right, right, the cute one

673
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,852
How would I hope that you might represent me

674
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:50,852
You have five thousand dollars?

675
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:53,278
That's a lot of money

676
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:56,250
Mama didn't say anything about five thousand dollars

677
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:58,712
Look it, eh, Mr. Flynn

678
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,934
I'm not good at this sort of thing

679
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:05,934
Maybe we could make
some sort of arrangements between us

680
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:08,448
I could be awfully a good sport

681
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,732
Good you got that idea of our system

682
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:10,631
Now listen

683
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,861
You mean just one thing to me

684
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:16,455
You call me when you got five thousand dollars

685
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:19,661
All he cares about is love

686
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:23,571
Show me long raven hair

687
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,886
Flowin' down, about to there

688
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,821
When I see her runnin' free

689
00:38:30,823 --> 00:38:35,821
Keep your money, that's enough for me

690
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:41,375
I don't care for drivin' Packard cars

691
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:45,560
Or smoking long buck cigars

692
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:47,921
No, no, not me

693
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:50,131
All I care about is

694
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:51,979
Doin' the guy in

695
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:54,112
Who's pickin', on you

696
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:56,004
Twistin' the wrist

697
00:38:56,007 --> 00:39:00,898
That's turnin' the screw

698
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:05,897
All I care about

699
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:11,269
Is love

700
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,338
Oh you'll see him now

701
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,476
- Well, hello, Andy
- Amos, my name is Amos

702
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:34,474
That's right, take a seat

703
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:38,687
You know, you're a remarkable man

704
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,379
Your wife two times you, plug the guy
and tries to pity on you

705
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,012
Most men are gonna dim with that swing,
but no

706
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,401
You're sticking by her

707
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:46,617
Actually hero in my eyes

708
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,226
That's right

709
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:49,661
I'm a hero

710
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:51,661
Did you bring the money?

711
00:39:52,385 --> 00:39:55,252
I didn't do as well as I hoped, but

712
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:59,680
I will, Mr. Flynn, I will

713
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,920
Ah, this is only a thousand

714
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:04,503
Plus the three hundred I borrowed
from the guy down at the garage

715
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,757
and there are seven...

716
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:09,116
Seven hundred from the building of Loan Fund

717
00:40:09,118 --> 00:40:10,116
Two thousand?

718
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,783
And that's all I got so far

719
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:15,800
But I'll give twenty dollars off my salary every week

720
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:19,337
I'll give you notes with interest,
double triple until every cent is paid, I promise

721
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,808
When you came to me yesterday

722
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:22,002
I didn't ask you if she was guilty

723
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,187
I didn't ask if she was innocent

724
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:26,439
I didn't ask if she was a drunk, or a dopefing, no

725
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,462
All I said was do you have five thousand dollars
You said yes

726
00:40:29,464 --> 00:40:31,777
But you don't have five thousand dollars

727
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,778
So I figure you're a dirty liar
I don't waste time on dirty liars

728
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:41,590
Look

729
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,273
I'm really sorry, Mr. Flynn

730
00:40:46,383 --> 00:40:47,941
On the other hand

731
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:51,763
Your devotion to your wife is really
very very touching

732
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,999
I'll take your wife's case
and I'll keep it

733
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:58,000
Because I play square

734
00:40:58,551 --> 00:41:00,301
Now, look, Hart

735
00:41:00,303 --> 00:41:02,193
I don't like to blow my own horn

736
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:06,606
But believe me, if Jesus Christ lived in Chicago today
if he had five thousand dollars

737
00:41:06,607 --> 00:41:10,605
And he come to me, things would've turned out differently

738
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:13,063
All right, this is what we gonna do

739
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:16,764
By the end of the week, I wanna have Roxie's name
in the front page of every newspaper in town

740
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:20,281
Sweetest Little Jazz Killer
Ever Lived in Chicago

741
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:22,280
That's the angle I'm after

742
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,860
You make the announcement,
we're gonna have an auction

743
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,939
Tell them we gotta raise money for her defense

744
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,212
They'll buy everything she's ever touched, everything

745
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:32,699
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfume, your underwear

746
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:36,960
Mm, the troller records
like the one I was playing when I shot the bastard

747
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:37,824
I didn't hear that

748
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:40,650
Not that I didn't have ground mind you
Hey what are they?

749
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:41,754
That's when we go to trial

750
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:43,904
Look, nobody, nobody's gonna care a lick

751
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:46,107
Watch your defenses unless they care about you

752
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:48,968
So the first thing we're gonna do
is to work out some sympathy from the press

753
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:51,045
I'm not pretty sure like Mary Sunshine

754
00:41:51,047 --> 00:41:53,725
But there's one thing they can never resist

755
00:41:53,726 --> 00:41:56,724
And that is, a reformed sinner

756
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,194
So tell me, what's your favorite subject in school

757
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:04,035
- Dalf, that was a real...
- There must be something that you're really good at

758
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:06,335
Oh I got high marks in the courtesy in hygiene

759
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,444
Perfect, you wanted to be a nun

760
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,543
Nun?

761
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:11,793
Where were you born?

762
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,671
On a chicken farm outside Lurburk

763
00:42:13,672 --> 00:42:16,715
Beautiful and silent home for every luxury and refinement

764
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:17,407
Where are your parents now?

765
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:20,523
Probably on front porch in their rocking chairs

766
00:42:20,525 --> 00:42:21,533
Parents are dead

767
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:25,418
Family fortune swept away
you're educated in the Sacred Heart

768
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:29,109
Then you fell into a run away
marriage, left you miserable alone

769
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,638
Unhappy, of course you got swept up
in the mad world of the city

770
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,975
Jazz, Cabaret, liquor, you're drawn like a moth to the flame
- A moth?

771
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:41,258
Now the mad world acceased,
and you are the butterfly

772
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,834
Crushed on the wheel

773
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:45,403
Which is it, is it the moth or the butterfly?

774
00:42:45,406 --> 00:42:50,398
- You have sinned in your sorrow
- God that's beautiful

775
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:54,103
Cut off God, stay where you're acquitted

776
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,634
Kid, when I'm through with you
not only will you be acquitted

777
00:42:57,636 --> 00:43:01,102
Every man in jury wanna take you home
to meet his mother

778
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:05,805
- I was born in a beautiful southern combat
- What?

779
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,837
Oh holy shit
Oh I'll never get this straight

780
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,385
Pipe down and swearing

781
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,580
Look, from now on
You say nothing about of damn

782
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,611
Now try again

783
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:16,580
I was born on a...

784
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,578
Come on, come on

785
00:43:46,098 --> 00:43:48,425
So what's the most thing I'm gonna do in  the witness stand

786
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:50,623
I thought I'd get all teary eyed

787
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,635
And ask for your handkerchief

788
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:55,633
Then I thought I'll take a peek at the Jury like this

789
00:43:55,657 --> 00:43:56,928
Flashing a bit thigh, hah?

790
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,765
What do you think?

791
00:43:58,765 --> 00:43:59,763
Sounds great

792
00:44:06,037 --> 00:44:07,239
Hey, don't you wanna hear the rest?

793
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,238
Come on, I'll get up, you can talk from my lists

794
00:44:11,406 --> 00:44:13,091
Well, well, well

795
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:16,091
Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn

796
00:44:16,756 --> 00:44:18,826
Hope you're not too bored

797
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:21,027
I like it

798
00:44:23,265 --> 00:44:25,263
I like it

799
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:31,631
Hey, Pauliana, I heard
your press conference is tomorrow

800
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:33,597
Yeah, what's up to you?

801
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,568
Well you wanted my advice right?

802
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:37,036
Well here it is

803
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:41,977
Don't forget Bailiff's No. 1 client is Billy Flynn

804
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,977
Meaning what?

805
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,398
Meaning

806
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:48,768
Don't let him hug the spotlight

807
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,768
You're the one they paid to see

808
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:56,966
Now remember, we can only
sell them one idea a time

809
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,243
Yeah, I can still see him coming after me
with that awful look in his eyes

810
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:01,136
And?

811
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:03,198
And we both reach for the gun

812
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,279
That's right, you both reach for the gun

813
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,479
Ready?

814
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:08,027
Yeah

815
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:20,909
Gentlemen, gentlemen, Ms. Sunshine

816
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,230
My client's just entered a plead of not guilty

817
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:26,230
We look forward to the trial at the earliest possible date.
Now is there any questions?

818
00:45:30,881 --> 00:45:31,580
Ms. Sunshine

819
00:45:31,581 --> 00:45:33,576
As you know, my paper is dry

820
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:37,215
Do you any advice for young girls
seeking to avoid a life of Jazz and drink

821
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:38,215
Absolutely yes.

822
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:42,034
Mrs. Hart feels that it's the tragic combination
of liquor and Jazz

823
00:45:42,037 --> 00:45:44,506
which led her to the downfall.
Next question

824
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,934
Ladies and gentlemen

825
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:49,180
I would just like to state how flattered
I am that you came to see you

826
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,471
Mrs. Hart is very...

827
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:53,247
You see I was a moth
crushed on the wheel

828
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,248
You know, a butterfly
drawn to the, to the...

829
00:45:58,698 --> 00:46:01,696
I bet you wanna know why I shot the bastard

830
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:03,717
Shut up, dummy

831
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:07,654
Mr. Billy Flynn in the "Press Conference Rag"

832
00:46:07,657 --> 00:46:11,655
notice how his mouth never moves - almost

833
00:46:12,021 --> 00:46:13,745
Where'd you come from?

834
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:15,546
Mississippi

835
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:16,874
And your parents?

836
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,039
Very wealthy.

837
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,764
Where are they now?

838
00:46:20,765 --> 00:46:23,891
Six feet under.
But she was granted one more start

839
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:28,892
The convent of the sacred heart!

840
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,938
When'd you get here?

841
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:36,716
1920

842
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:38,252
How old were you?

843
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,229
Don't remember

844
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:41,767
Then what happened?

845
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,147
I met Amos
And he stole my heart away

846
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:47,164
Convinced me to elope one day

847
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:50,065
Oh, poor dear, I can't believe
what you've been through

848
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:52,675
A convent girl! A run-away marriage!

849
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,363
Now tell us Roxie

850
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:56,144
Who's Fred Casely?

851
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,943
My ex-boyfriend

852
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:59,464
Why'd you shoot him

853
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:01,441
I was leavin'

854
00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:03,209
Was he angry?

855
00:47:03,212 --> 00:47:06,307
Like a madman!
Still I said, "Fred, move along."

856
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,572
She knew that she was doin' wrong

857
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:10,088
Then describe it

858
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:12,009
He came toward me.

859
00:47:12,012 --> 00:47:13,701
With a pistol?

860
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:15,546
From my bureau

861
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:17,239
Did you fight him?

862
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,882
Like a tiger

863
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,645
He had strength and she had none

864
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:22,494
And yet we both reached for the gun

865
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:25,028
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes we both
Oh yes, we both

866
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:26,731
Oh yes, we both reached for the gun

867
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:27,915
the gun, the gun, the gun

868
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:32,915
Oh yes, we both reached for the gun
For the gun.

869
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:42,738
Understandable, understandable

870
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:46,983
Yes, it's perfectly understandable

871
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:51,051
Comprehensible, comprehensible

872
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:54,612
Not a bit reprehensible

873
00:47:54,613 --> 00:47:59,611
It's so defensible!

874
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:03,563
How you're feeling?

875
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:05,286
Very frightened

876
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:07,022
Are you sorry?

877
00:48:07,023 --> 00:48:08,888
Are you kidding?

878
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,636
What's your statement?

879
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,203
All I'd say is

880
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:13,653
Though my choo-choo jumped the track

881
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:15,722
I'd give my life to bring him back

882
00:48:15,723 --> 00:48:17,414
- And?
- Stay away from

883
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:19,204
- What?
- Jazz and liquor

884
00:48:19,205 --> 00:48:20,794
- And?
- And the man who

885
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:22,313
-What?
- Play for fun

886
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,241
- And what?
- That's the thought that

887
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:25,937
- Yeah!
- Came upon me

888
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:29,726
- When?
- When we both reached for the gun!

889
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:34,166
Understandable, understandable

890
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:38,529
Yes, it's perfectly understandable

891
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,609
Comprehensible, comprehensible

892
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:46,661
Not a bit reprehensible

893
00:48:46,664 --> 00:48:51,662
It's so defensible!

894
00:48:55,312 --> 00:49:00,310
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both

895
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,314
Oh yes they both

896
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:03,933
Oh yes, they both

897
00:49:03,935 --> 00:49:07,671
- Reach for the gun
- Let me hear it

898
00:49:07,672 --> 00:49:09,773
Oh yes, they both reached
For the gun

899
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:10,991
For the gun.

900
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,080
A little louder!

901
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,822
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both

902
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:14,970
Oh yes they both

903
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:19,969
Oh yes they both reach for the gun

904
00:49:20,492 --> 00:49:21,665
Now you got it

905
00:49:21,665 --> 00:49:23,350
Oh yes, oh yes oh yes  they both

906
00:49:23,352 --> 00:49:24,481
Oh yes they both

907
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:29,479
Oh yes they both reach for the gun

908
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:50,920
Both reach for the gun

909
00:50:03,782 --> 00:50:05,213
Move all by a capone

910
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:08,190
The windy city has taken
a new criminal to a talk

911
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:11,189
The name on everybody's lips is Roxie Hart

912
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,594
The sweetest little lady ever
accused of murder in Chicago

913
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,124
Women wanna look like her

914
00:50:16,126 --> 00:50:17,888
Fellows wanna go out with her

915
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,249
Some little girls even wanna take her home

916
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,538
Don't get any ideas, little lady

917
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,805
On the other side of town

918
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:28,804
The assistant DA promises the keen shant shootre
shall swing before the year is up

919
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:29,934
Who knows?

920
00:50:30,037 --> 00:50:35,035
If he lives up to his word, assistant DA Harrison
might become Governor Harrison some day

921
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:37,486
Back at the scene of the crime

922
00:50:37,488 --> 00:50:41,387
Everybody wants a little piece of Roxie Hart

923
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:45,490
This jar of colgraine sent her husband back 20 dollars

924
00:50:45,492 --> 00:50:49,774
Maybe this pretty little lady
would get some of that famous Roxie style

925
00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:52,898
It seems everybody these days is ruling for

926
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:55,897
Roxie Hart

927
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,430
Take off these flowers
and make sure they do send them

928
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:04,554
So, kiddo

929
00:51:04,555 --> 00:51:07,218
You've any thought what you wann do
after Billy get you off

930
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,724
Yeah,  I think I'd like to go on the stage

931
00:51:09,725 --> 00:51:11,193
Yeah, figure it as much

932
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:13,703
I've already called the Morris office

933
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,592
Really? How much is that gonna cost me?

934
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:19,801
Very fair to do, ten percent of all your takings

935
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:21,786
Yeah, we'll see, Mama

936
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,429
Besides, I don't even have an act yet

937
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:26,611
Well, killing Fred Caseley was your act

938
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:29,520
May not ??? audience
???

939
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,518
It's a freak act

940
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:32,672
Besides

941
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:34,356
Hi

942
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,413
I'm better than that

943
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:38,083
Of course you are, cup cake

944
00:51:38,084 --> 00:51:40,228
I mean you may be as big as Sophie Tago

945
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,223
You really think so?

946
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,144
Made Canton and Joseph can buy

947
00:51:43,146 --> 00:51:46,803
You know I always wanted to have my name on those papers

948
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:47,647
You know before I met Amos

949
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:51,239
I used to date with this well to do ugly bootlegger

950
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,525
He used to like to take me out and show me off

951
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:57,525
Ugly guys like to do that

952
00:51:59,273 --> 00:52:01,009
Once it's said in the paper

953
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:06,009
Gamelands Alcapella seen a shavito
with a cute blonde

954
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,698
That was me

955
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,112
I cliffed and I saved better

956
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:13,111
You know all my life

957
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:16,317
I wanna have my own act

958
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,559
But no, no no no no

959
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:20,855
It's always no, they always turn me down

960
00:52:20,857 --> 00:52:23,855
One big world full of no

961
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:29,316
And then Amos came along

962
00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:32,400
Safe, sweet Amos

963
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,519
He never says no

964
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:43,786
I've never done this before

965
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:44,752
But you know

966
00:52:44,753 --> 00:52:46,367
It is such a special night

967
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,368
And you're such a great audience

968
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:56,661
And I just, I really feel I can
I can talk to you, you know

969
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,574
So forget what you've read in the papers

970
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:01,850
And forget what you've heard from the radios

971
00:53:01,853 --> 00:53:03,944
Because, because

972
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:06,943
Because I'm gonna tell you the truth

973
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:09,603
Not that the truth really matters

974
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:14,790
But I'm gonna tell you anyway

975
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:18,039
On the bed of the apartment

976
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:21,040
Amos was

977
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,397
Zero

978
00:53:23,854 --> 00:53:26,314
I mean when he made love to me

979
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:27,715
It was like

980
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:30,714
I think he was fixing a carburetor or something

981
00:53:30,952 --> 00:53:33,950
I like you, honey, I love you

982
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:36,653
Anyway

983
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:40,805
I started fooling around

984
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,696
Then I started screwing around

985
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:46,695
Which is fooling around without dinner

986
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,575
Then I met Fred Caseley

987
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:53,960
Who said that he can get me into the Veaudebill

988
00:53:53,961 --> 00:53:56,959
But that ain't quite work out like I've planned

989
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:02,471
I guess it didn't really work out to grateful Fred either

990
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,758
So I gave up on the whole idea

991
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,956
If you can't figure after all these use

992
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:18,868
Opportunities just pass you by

993
00:54:14,196 --> 00:54:15,286
And now,

994
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:18,310
with this swing I get 'em all

995
00:54:18,312 --> 00:54:20,159
with all these publicity,

996
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:23,268
l got me a world full of yes!

997
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:27,219
The name on everybody's lips

998
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:30,581
Is gonna be Roxie

999
00:54:30,584 --> 00:54:34,706
The lady rakin' in the chips

1000
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:38,267
Is gonna be Roxie

1001
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:40,746
I'm gonna be a celebrity

1002
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:44,585
That means somebody everyone knows

1003
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:48,429
They're gonna recognize my eyes

1004
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:53,463
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose

1005
00:54:56,224 --> 00:55:00,260
From just some dumb mechanic's wife

1006
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,505
I'm gonna be Roxie

1007
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:08,542
Who says that murder's not an art?

1008
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:14,558
And who in case she doesn't hang

1009
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:19,592
Can say she started with a bang?

1010
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:24,825
Roxie Hart!

1011
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:42,825
Boys

1012
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,257
They're gonna wait outside in line

1013
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,625
To get to see Roxie

1014
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:55,608
Think of those autographs I'll sign

1015
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:58,949
"Good luck to you, Roxie"

1016
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:01,403
And I'll appear in a lavaliere

1017
00:56:01,404 --> 00:56:05,935
That goes all the way down to my waist

1018
00:56:05,938 --> 00:56:09,514
Here a ring, there a ring
Everywhere a ring a ling

1019
00:56:09,514 --> 00:56:14,548
But always the best of taste

1020
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,289
l'm a star.

1021
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:23,037
And the audience loves me.
And l love them.

1022
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:29,381
And they love me for loving them.
And l love them for loving me.

1023
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:32,783
And we love each other.

1024
00:56:33,918 --> 00:56:37,738
And that's cause none of us got
enough love in our childhoods.

1025
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:42,444
And that's showbiz.... kid.

1026
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:48,553
She's giving up her humdrum life

1027
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:52,027
I'm gonna be, sing it's Roxie

1028
00:56:52,028 --> 00:56:57,062
She made a scandal and a start

1029
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:01,962
And Sophie Tucker will shit, I know

1030
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:06,997
To see her name get billed below

1031
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:12,494
Roxie Hart!

1032
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:40,587
l just can't take it anymore.

1033
00:57:40,881 --> 00:57:43,778
I can't go anywhere without hearing
about that dumb tomato!

1034
00:57:46,427 --> 00:57:49,030
Oh, no Mama, not you too.

1035
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:52,852
l've got some bad news, kid.
The tour has been cancelled.

1036
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:53,649
What?

1037
00:57:53,988 --> 00:57:55,666
Your name is out of the paper too long.

1038
00:57:55,878 --> 00:57:59,825
All you read about today,
is the Hart kid. She's hot.

1039
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:07,261
And what am l supposed to do?
Suck up to her like everybody else?

1040
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:08,396
lt couldn't hurt.

1041
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,715
Over my dead body.

1042
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,394
Mind if l join you?

1043
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:16,925
Lights out.

1044
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:19,444
Smoke?

1045
00:58:22,387 --> 00:58:24,696
Look what some Johnny sent me.

1046
00:58:24,907 --> 00:58:28,602
Triple cream caramel,
all the way from San Francisco.

1047
00:58:30,032 --> 00:58:33,475
l'm watching my figure.
You know, the trial.

1048
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,313
Hey, Great mentioned that
you're on a trip today, huh?

1049
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:43,138
There have been so many,
l just can't keep track.

1050
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:49,690
Hey did I ever tell you,
you're exactly the same size as my sister.

1051
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,380
l mean, you fit into
her costume perfectly.

1052
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:53,809
Really?

1053
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:55,194
Yeah, l was just thinking, you know,

1054
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,647
with all the publicity that's piled up
between us when Billy gets us off,

1055
00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:02,462
would we be a
natural to do an act together.

1056
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:04,898
You think so huh?

1057
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:13,259
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Velma Kelly in an act of desperation.

1058
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,476
My sister and l
had an act that couldn't flop.

1059
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:24,432
My sister and l
were headed straight for the top.

1060
00:59:25,022 --> 00:59:29,138
My sister and l
earned a thou a week at least.

1061
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:30,273
Oh yeah

1062
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:35,609
But my sister is
now unfortunately deceased.

1063
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:41,027
l know it's sad of course,
but a fact is still a fact.

1064
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:46,697
And now all that remains is the remains...

1065
00:59:46,994 --> 00:59:48,378
of a perfect...

1066
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,614
double... act.

1067
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:54,133
Watch this.

1068
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:59,258
They have to imagine it with 2 people.
lt's swell with two people.

1069
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:00,771
First, l'd...

1070
01:00:03,923 --> 01:00:05,434
Then,  she'd...

1071
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:09,761
Then, we'd...

1072
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:14,298
But l can't do it alone.

1073
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:15,683
Then, she'd...

1074
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:19,716
Then, l'd...

1075
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,835
Then, we'd...

1076
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:28,876
But l can't do it alone.

1077
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:31,816
She'd say, what's your sister like?

1078
01:00:32,027 --> 01:00:33,622
l'd say, man.

1079
01:00:34,421 --> 01:00:39,545
She'd say, you're the cat's meow
And we wow the crowd again.

1080
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:41,982
When she'd go...

1081
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:45,509
l'd go...

1082
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:50,342
We'd go...

1083
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:59,920
And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped, and stamped on the floor

1084
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:03,449
Yelling, screaming, begging for more

1085
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:06,769
And we'd say, okay, fellows.
Keep your socks up.

1086
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:09,079
Cause you ain't seen nothing yet.

1087
01:01:18,657 --> 01:01:23,865
But I simply cannot do it alone.

1088
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,176
So what do you think?

1089
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:29,536
Come on, you can say.

1090
01:01:34,873 --> 01:01:36,971
l know you're right.
The first part is shit.

1091
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:38,192
But the second part...

1092
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,299
Second part is really nifty.

1093
01:01:42,014 --> 01:01:44,828
Okay, she'd go...

1094
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:51,172
l'd go...

1095
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:58,523
We'd go...

1096
01:02:08,965 --> 01:02:12,606
And then those two-bit Johnnies did it up brow

1097
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:15,331
To cheer the best attraction in town

1098
01:02:15,334 --> 01:02:18,772
They really tore the balcony down

1099
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:21,503
We'd say, okay, boys,
we're going home.

1100
01:02:21,714 --> 01:02:25,199
But before we go,
here's a few more partin' shots!

1101
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:28,350
And this...this we did
in perfect unison.

1102
01:02:37,803 --> 01:02:40,112
Now you've seen me going through it.

1103
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:42,759
You may think there's nothing to it.

1104
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:47,674
But l simply cannot do it...

1105
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:53,723
Alone!

1106
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:59,540
So where's the part
we blew the brains out?

1107
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,834
Okay, Roxie. l'll...

1108
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,837
No, don't bother.

1109
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,048
You think you're fooling me?
You're all washed up.

1110
01:03:07,342 --> 01:03:11,637
And it's me they want now,
and l'm a big star.

1111
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,058
Single.

1112
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:17,731
Oh l almost forgot.
You're in the paper today too.

1113
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:18,940
ln the back.

1114
01:03:19,151 --> 01:03:26,659
Velma Kelly's trial has been
postponed indefinitely.

1115
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,371
Seven words.

1116
01:03:33,962 --> 01:03:38,550
And here's a little piece of advice.
Direct from me to you.

1117
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:40,052
Lay off the caramels.

1118
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,154
And now, for all you
Chicago's stay-up-laters.

1119
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:57,575
Night hours would
only come alive at the dark.

1120
01:03:57,744 --> 01:04:03,751
We dedicate this tune
Chicago After Midnight.

1121
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:12,680
This all took place in Lesurevelt?

1122
01:04:12,973 --> 01:04:14,348
lncredible.

1123
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:17,978
All right. Thanks.

1124
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,569
They just arrest this woman for
triple homicide.

1125
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:24,571
Really?

1126
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,656
Yeah, get this. She's an Aries!

1127
01:04:27,783 --> 01:04:31,870
Now her family is in the pineapple
or grapefruit, some kind of fruits.

1128
01:04:32,957 --> 01:04:37,587
The demon Kitty works in
something... She's playing house.

1129
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,383
On the north side in an apartment,
she met Harry.

1130
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,595
What Harry does for living,
no one's quite sure.

1131
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:45,597
But it doesn't really matter
cause she's paying all the bills.

1132
01:04:45,892 --> 01:04:49,769
Anyhow, Kitty comes home tonight.
Harry was already in bed, which is a part of his course from Harry

1133
01:04:50,899 --> 01:04:57,280
She goes to change. When she returns,
she notices something rather odd.

1134
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,200
Extremely odd

1135
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,586
Kitty disappears for a second.

1136
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:09,296
Cool as a cucumber

1137
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:12,886
And she returns,
she gently wakes up Harry.

1138
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:16,680
Harry says, ''What? l'm alone!''

1139
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:20,603
She says, ''Alone? Yyou have
two other women in bed with you!''

1140
01:05:22,273 --> 01:05:27,779
And Harry says, ''Come on, darling,
you gonna believe what you see or what l tell you?''

1141
01:05:37,878 --> 01:05:38,878
Good night, folks.

1142
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,514
Miss Baxter, Miss Baxter!

1143
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:50,102
Mary Sunshine from The Evening Star.

1144
01:05:50,396 --> 01:05:52,605
Would you mind saying a word or two?

1145
01:05:52,897 --> 01:05:55,190
Sure l'll say three. Go to hell!

1146
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:57,987
Please direct your
questions to the counsel.

1147
01:05:58,406 --> 01:05:59,989
You're not my counsel
l want my money back!

1148
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,991
lt's not your money.
lt's your mother's money.

1149
01:06:02,286 --> 01:06:02,993
Are you sorry, dear?

1150
01:06:03,705 --> 01:06:06,623
Yeah, l'm sorry, sorry l got caught.

1151
01:06:08,209 --> 01:06:09,792
Oh hey, Miss Sunshine.
Not now, Roxie.

1152
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:14,008
l got a letter from a guy.
He says he's gone on a hungry strike until l'm free.

1153
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:15,009
That's nice.

1154
01:06:15,303 --> 01:06:18,514
Miss Baxter, did you know
these two ladies personally?

1155
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,605
Did l know these two ladies
personally? Was that your question?

1156
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:24,897
Yeah, that's my ques...

1157
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:29,527
She's very hot spirit, isn't she?

1158
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:30,697
Miss Baxter...

1159
01:06:31,324 --> 01:06:33,116
Oh hey, Mr. Flynn.

1160
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,329
-Yeah, hi, Tracy.
-lt's Roxie.

1161
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:37,624
Yeah, sure, l'm just kidding.

1162
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:39,499
Did you get my trial date yet?

1163
01:06:40,503 --> 01:06:43,130
-Listen, kid.
-l'm on top of your list, right?

1164
01:06:43,424 --> 01:06:44,299
Go to hell!

1165
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:48,638
What a helling, huh?
And social-like too.

1166
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,513
Her mother owns all the pineapples in Hawaii.

1167
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:52,142
What the hell do l care about pineapples?

1168
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,601
All right...

1169
01:06:55,022 --> 01:06:58,024
And now, that's all, direct all your questions

1170
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,612
And afterwards l'll be happy to get back to you myself.

1171
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:01,905
Billy...

1172
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,122
How does it feel, kid?

1173
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:13,128
Pretty soon we couldn't find
your name in the papers.

1174
01:07:19,722 --> 01:07:21,640
Mr. Flynn?

1175
01:07:24,229 --> 01:07:25,520
Someone open this door immediately.

1176
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,731
Oh, my God. Roxie!
What is it to you?

1177
01:07:30,736 --> 01:07:34,240
Oh, no. Don't worry about me.

1178
01:07:35,327 --> 01:07:38,621
l only hope the fall didn't hurt the baby.

1179
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:40,040
Baby?

1180
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,542
Shit!

1181
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:50,274
Roxie, when did this happen darling?

1182
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,959
Well, doctor, is she or isn't she?

1183
01:08:14,253 --> 01:08:15,836
She is.

1184
01:08:18,551 --> 01:08:21,053
Would you swear that statement in court?

1185
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:24,849
-Yes.
-Good. Button your fly.

1186
01:08:36,468 --> 01:08:37,467
I would...

1187
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:41,455
I would just like to say that
when my own life doesn't matter now.

1188
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:43,957
just that of my unborn child.

1189
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:47,254
Poor dear, to have your baby born in jail.

1190
01:08:47,464 --> 01:08:49,047
My readers won't stand for that.

1191
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:50,677
l can assure you that won't happen.

1192
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:52,761
The trial would come in
the least possible moment.

1193
01:08:55,058 --> 01:08:57,559
First time we're ever have
one more girl knocked up.

1194
01:08:58,353 --> 01:08:59,353
Hey, Roxie...

1195
01:08:59,563 --> 01:09:04,987
Roxie! l just have the good news!

1196
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,364
l'm the father.

1197
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:09,075
Hey, Roxie, who's the father?

1198
01:09:09,285 --> 01:09:10,953
The question is completely out of line.

1199
01:09:11,163 --> 01:09:14,554
How dare you insult this brave young woman?

1200
01:09:14,556 --> 01:09:15,555
That's enough

1201
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:21,091
Roxie, honey! lt's me, it's daddy!

1202
01:09:25,182 --> 01:09:27,267
Roxie, l'd get to you as soon as l could.

1203
01:09:40,564 --> 01:09:43,459
If someone stood up in a crowd

1204
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:46,224
And raised his voice up way out loud

1205
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:49,292
And waved his arm and shook his leg

1206
01:09:49,294 --> 01:09:52,506
You'd notice him

1207
01:09:52,507 --> 01:09:57,094
If someone in the movie show
Yelled "Fire in the second row

1208
01:09:57,095 --> 01:10:00,679
This whole place is a powder keg!"

1209
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,329
You'd notice him

1210
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:08,998
And even without clucking like a hen

1211
01:10:08,999 --> 01:10:13,038
Everyone gets noticed, now and then

1212
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,886
Unless, of course, that personage should be

1213
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:22,887
Invisible, inconsequential me!

1214
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:35,041
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane

1215
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,288
Shoulda been my name

1216
01:10:38,289 --> 01:10:41,195
Mister Cellophane

1217
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:44,925
'Cause you can look right through me

1218
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:48,420
Walk right by me

1219
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:51,748
And never know I'm there...

1220
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:57,750
I tell ya Cellophane
Mister Cellophane

1221
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,485
Shoulda been my name

1222
01:11:01,488 --> 01:11:04,295
Mister Cellophane

1223
01:11:04,297 --> 01:11:07,785
'Cause you can look right through me

1224
01:11:07,786 --> 01:11:11,372
Walk right by me

1225
01:11:11,373 --> 01:11:16,327
And never know I'm there

1226
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:19,624
Oh, l didn't see you.
Sit down.

1227
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:25,007
Look, Andy, l'm afraid l'm gotta hit you hard.

1228
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,135
l can only hope you would think about it.

1229
01:11:27,429 --> 01:11:30,515
-Amos, my name is Amos.
-Who says it wasn't?

1230
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:33,602
lt was the kid's name l was thinking about.

1231
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:37,232
You know when she's due?
September.

1232
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:40,404
You'd pass out those cigars anyway.

1233
01:11:40,738 --> 01:11:43,824
l don't want you to give a damn on the people.
-People what?

1234
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:47,328
-Laugh.
-Laugh? Why would they laugh?

1235
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:50,416
They can count. Can you count?

1236
01:11:50,919 --> 01:11:52,336
September.

1237
01:11:55,508 --> 01:11:59,511
lt's the copy of Roxie's
first statement from D.A. office.

1238
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:03,016
Says she hasn't copulated with you
for four months prior to the incidents.

1239
01:12:03,227 --> 01:12:09,025
She would know. Yeah,
l guess we've done no copulating since...

1240
01:12:10,946 --> 01:12:12,029
Wait a minute.

1241
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,742
That doesn't figure out right.
l couldn't be the father.

1242
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:18,454
Well, forget about that now
My client needs your support.

1243
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:20,455
You mean she needs a meal ticket?

1244
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,254
That's all l've ever been.
But this time she's gone too far.

1245
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:27,048
What're you gonna do?
Divorce her?

1246
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,927
You're damn right!
l'll divorce her!

1247
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,224
She probably won't even notice.

1248
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:40,649
Yeah. l'm sorry.

1249
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:47,054
A human being's made of more than air

1250
01:12:47,055 --> 01:12:50,819
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there

1251
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:55,820
Unless that human bein' next to you

1252
01:12:55,932 --> 01:13:00,519
Is unimpressive, undistinguished

1253
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,519
You know who

1254
01:13:06,936 --> 01:13:09,647
-You're still here?
-Yeah, l'm still here.

1255
01:13:11,664 --> 01:13:12,663
I think

1256
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:17,482
Shoulda been my name

1257
01:13:17,484 --> 01:13:20,250
Mister Cellophane

1258
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:24,121
'Cause you can look right through me

1259
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:27,038
Walk right by me

1260
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:32,039
And never know I'm there

1261
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:37,765
I tell ya Cellophane
Mister Cellophane

1262
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:40,499
Shoulda been my name

1263
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,096
Mister Cellophane

1264
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:46,751
'Cause you can look right through me

1265
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,685
Walk right by me

1266
01:13:49,687 --> 01:13:54,686
And never know I'm there

1267
01:13:55,491 --> 01:14:03,492
Never even know

1268
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:08,656
I'm there

1269
01:14:14,277 --> 01:14:16,570
Hope l didn't take up too much of your time.

1270
01:14:21,996 --> 01:14:24,289
l've been waiting for you 10 minutes.
Don't do that again.

1271
01:14:24,582 --> 01:14:28,376
This dress makes me look like a
wulworth lampshade. l'm not wearing this.

1272
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,670
You wear it because l tell you to wear it.

1273
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:30,672
l'm not wearing this dress.

1274
01:14:30,882 --> 01:14:32,465
And when Andy's on the stand,
l want you be knitting.

1275
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,802
Knitting? For Christ's sake.

1276
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,679
-A baby garment.
-l don't know how to knit!

1277
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:39,976
Then learn.
-That's no way to win the jury's sympathy.

1278
01:14:40,187 --> 01:14:43,981
-You don't need advice anymore?
-Look at here, Mr. Mouthpiece.

1279
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:48,905
lt seems to me that l am the one
who's coming up with the good ideas.

1280
01:14:49,073 --> 01:14:52,577
l'm sick of everybody telling me what to do.
And you treat me like dirt.

1281
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,872
You know that? You treat me like I'm some dumb,
common criminal.

1282
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,875
But you're some dumb,
common criminal.

1283
01:14:58,085 --> 01:15:01,297
Well, it's better than being a
greasy mick lawyer.

1284
01:15:01,589 --> 01:15:05,301
-We're happy who's saving your ass.
-Who's out for all. He can steal!

1285
01:15:05,512 --> 01:15:07,179
Maybe you'd like
to appeal on court without me.

1286
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:11,309
Maybe l could. Have you read
the morning papers? They love me.

1287
01:15:11,602 --> 01:15:15,815
There maybe a lot more when you're hanged.
You know why? 'Cause it's sold more papers.

1288
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,111
-You're fired.
-l quit.

1289
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:22,616
Any lawyer in this town
would die to have my case.

1290
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:26,204
You're a phony celebrity.
You're a flash in the pan

1291
01:15:26,414 --> 01:15:28,707
ln a couple of weeks,
no one would give a shit about you.

1292
01:15:29,794 --> 01:15:31,921
That's Chicago.

1293
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:37,511
No! Not guilty!

1294
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:42,310
What happened?

1295
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,689
lt's Hunyak. She lost the last appeal.

1296
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,691
So what does that mean?

1297
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:53,198
What that means?
Next week, she's gonna...

1298
01:16:05,509 --> 01:16:09,512
This is Mary Sunshine,
coming to you from the Cook County Jail,

1299
01:16:09,723 --> 01:16:12,100
where history will be made today.

1300
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:18,609
Katelin Helinsky would become the first woman
in the state of lllinois to be executed.

1301
01:16:18,818 --> 01:16:20,027
And so ladies and gentlemen...

1302
01:16:20,236 --> 01:16:23,740
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for your pleasure and your entertainment,

1303
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:31,125
we proudly present Katelin Helinsky
and her famous Hungarian Disappearing Act.

1304
01:17:54,237 --> 01:17:57,156
Bravo!

1305
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:11,677
You know, it's really not that bad.

1306
01:18:11,969 --> 01:18:13,470
You're clear with
everything we agreed on?

1307
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,140
Yup. l've been up all night
rehearsing.

1308
01:18:16,351 --> 01:18:18,059
What do you do
when Harrison comes after you?

1309
01:18:18,269 --> 01:18:21,271
l sit still and look straight ahead.
Never look the jury.

1310
01:18:21,483 --> 01:18:23,442
-And?
-And l look modest.

1311
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:25,946
-And?
-And...

1312
01:18:26,155 --> 01:18:28,657
-And say nothing.
-That's right, that's right.

1313
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:29,951
-That was the deal, right?
-Right.

1314
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,161
You ask me back,
l do all the talking and stuff.

1315
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:34,456
Absolutely, Billy.
Whatever you say.

1316
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:38,086
-Mr. Flynn, his honor is here.
-Thank you.

1317
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,382
You ready?

1318
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:42,884
Yeah.

1319
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:48,057
Billy...

1320
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:52,356
l'm scared.

1321
01:18:54,192 --> 01:18:55,775
Na, don't be.

1322
01:18:56,779 --> 01:19:00,283
l've been around a long time.
Believe me, you've got nothing to worry about.

1323
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:06,957
lt's all a circus.
A three-ring circus.

1324
01:19:07,377 --> 01:19:13,092
These trials, the whole world...
it's all the show business.

1325
01:19:14,293 --> 01:19:15,393
But kid

1326
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:20,320
You're working with a star

1327
01:19:26,316 --> 01:19:30,558
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

1328
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,972
Razzle dazzle 'em

1329
01:19:33,973 --> 01:19:38,173
Give 'em act with lots of flash in it

1330
01:19:38,175 --> 01:19:41,789
And the reaction will be passionate

1331
01:19:41,789 --> 01:19:46,284
Give 'em the old hocus pocus

1332
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:49,801
Bead and feather 'em

1333
01:19:49,802 --> 01:19:54,801
How can they see with sequins in their eyes?

1334
01:19:57,806 --> 01:20:01,648
What if your hinges all are rusting?

1335
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:06,002
What if, in fact, you're just disgusting?

1336
01:20:06,003 --> 01:20:08,087
Razzle dazzle 'em

1337
01:20:08,088 --> 01:20:12,388
And they'll never catch wise

1338
01:20:25,456 --> 01:20:29,751
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

1339
01:20:29,754 --> 01:20:33,167
Razzle dazzle 'em

1340
01:20:33,168 --> 01:20:37,164
Give 'em a show that's so splendiferous

1341
01:20:37,167 --> 01:20:41,128
Row after row will grow vociferous

1342
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:45,467
Give 'em the old flim flam flummox

1343
01:20:45,468 --> 01:20:48,802
Fool and fracture 'em

1344
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:53,802
How can they hear the truth above the roar?

1345
01:20:56,958 --> 01:21:00,688
Throw 'em a fake and a finagle

1346
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,700
They'll never know you're just a bagel

1347
01:21:04,702 --> 01:21:07,142
Razzle dazzle 'em

1348
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:12,142
And they'll beg you for more

1349
01:21:12,628 --> 01:21:14,128
-Object!
-Sustained.

1350
01:21:14,339 --> 01:21:16,340
Your honour, l haven't even
asked a question yet.

1351
01:21:27,851 --> 01:21:32,103
Give 'em the old double whammy

1352
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:35,311
Daze and dizzy 'em

1353
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:39,154
Back since the days of old Methuselah

1354
01:21:39,156 --> 01:21:44,155
Everyone loves the big bambooz-a-ler

1355
01:21:44,937 --> 01:21:49,082
Give 'em the old three ring circus

1356
01:21:49,085 --> 01:21:52,507
Stun and stagger 'em

1357
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:57,507
When you're in trouble, go into your dance

1358
01:22:00,455 --> 01:22:03,942
Though you are stiffer than a girder

1359
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:08,419
They let ya get away with a murder

1360
01:22:08,421 --> 01:22:10,312
Razzle dazzle 'em

1361
01:22:10,314 --> 01:22:14,626
And you've got a romance

1362
01:22:14,627 --> 01:22:16,044
Hello, Amos.

1363
01:22:16,255 --> 01:22:20,048
Amos? That's right, Mr. Flynn. Amos

1364
01:22:20,845 --> 01:22:22,553
Amos, when did you file sue for divorce?

1365
01:22:22,763 --> 01:22:23,555
A month ago.

1366
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:25,849
Was there any reason for
filing at this particular time?

1367
01:22:26,059 --> 01:22:30,647
l'd say, the newspapers said
Roxie was expecting a little stranger.

1368
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:32,566
That's hardly a cause for divorce, isn't it?

1369
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,652
A little too much of a stranger.

1370
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:39,243
You mean you doubted
the fraternity of the child.

1371
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:40,035
Well sure.

1372
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:42,537
Tell me something, Amos.
You share a bed with your wife?

1373
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:43,832
Yes, sir, every night.

1374
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,168
You expect the jury to believe that

1375
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:50,759
you slept next to this woman every night
without exercising the rights of a husband?

1376
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,345
-l could if l want to.
-Oh, but you didn't.

1377
01:22:53,554 --> 01:22:54,638
-No, l did.
-Did what?

1378
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,265
-Want to.
-But you didn't.

1379
01:22:56,475 --> 01:22:57,766
-Didn't what?
-What you wanted.

1380
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,769
Wait a minute,
l'm getting confused here.

1381
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:03,441
Hey, you tell me, Hart.
Since you ever question Roxie herself,

1382
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:06,945
did you even bother to ask her
if you were the father of the child?

1383
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,656
-No, sir.
-No. What?

1384
01:23:09,076 --> 01:23:12,162
lf you became convinced that you were wrong,
you'd be mad enough in a minute.

1385
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:17,668
You would take her back if Roxie
swore that you're the father of the child,

1386
01:23:17,878 --> 01:23:19,461
-which she does.
-She does?

1387
01:23:22,551 --> 01:23:23,678
She does!

1388
01:23:25,263 --> 01:23:28,267
No more question!
You can step down now.

1389
01:23:28,851 --> 01:23:30,979
Well done, Andy.

1390
01:23:31,982 --> 01:23:33,563
Roxie, l'm so sorry.

1391
01:23:46,963 --> 01:23:51,229
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

1392
01:23:51,229 --> 01:23:54,495
Razzle dazzle 'em

1393
01:23:54,498 --> 01:23:59,494
Show 'em the first rate sorcerer you are

1394
01:24:02,219 --> 01:24:05,922
Long as you keep 'em way off balance

1395
01:24:05,924 --> 01:24:10,209
How can they spot you got no talents?

1396
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,180
Razzle dazzle 'em

1397
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:14,004
Razzle dazzle 'em

1398
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:16,753
Razzle dazzle 'em

1399
01:24:16,755 --> 01:24:19,046
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

1400
01:24:19,256 --> 01:24:23,632
Roxie Hart finally takes the stand
in her own defense.

1401
01:24:24,732 --> 01:24:29,728
And they'll make you a star!

1402
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:40,934
Hold it!

1403
01:24:40,935 --> 01:24:42,435
Proceed, Mr. Flynn.

1404
01:24:42,727 --> 01:24:47,227
Roxie, l have here a statement
which you admitted having illicit relations

1405
01:24:47,522 --> 01:24:49,813
with deceased Fred Casely.
ls this statement true or false?

1406
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:51,523
l'm afraid that's true.

1407
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:53,232
You're an honestly girl, Roxie.

1408
01:24:54,443 --> 01:24:56,525
When did you first meet Fred Casely?

1409
01:24:56,818 --> 01:24:59,109
When he sold Amos and me our furniture.

1410
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,528
Your personal relationship with him,
you tell the jury when that began.

1411
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:06,030
When l permitted him
to escort me home one night,

1412
01:25:06,324 --> 01:25:07,739
l don't think l would've gone with him

1413
01:25:07,909 --> 01:25:10,909
if Mr. Hart and me hadn't
quarreled that very morning.

1414
01:25:11,242 --> 01:25:12,241
-Quarreled?
-Yes, sir.

1415
01:25:12,535 --> 01:25:14,826
Well, l supposed it was his fault.

1416
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,536
Oh, no, sir. lt was my fault.

1417
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,622
l supposed l just couldn't stop
pestering him.

1418
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,330
Pestering him? About what?

1419
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:25,124
l didn't like him working
those long hours at the garage.

1420
01:25:25,418 --> 01:25:30,419
l wanted him home with me...
to darn his socks and iron his shirts.

1421
01:25:30,713 --> 01:25:33,214
l wanted a real home and a child.

1422
01:25:33,422 --> 01:25:38,006
So you drifted into this illicit relationship
because you're unhappy at home.

1423
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:41,301
Yes, was almost unhappy.

1424
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,425
Roxie Hart!

1425
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:46,509
The state has accused you
the murder of Fred Casely.

1426
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:48,596
Are you guilty or not guilty?

1427
01:25:48,889 --> 01:25:49,888
l'm not guilty...

1428
01:25:50,143 --> 01:25:51,096
I'm not guilty

1429
01:25:51,098 --> 01:25:56,114
l killed him, l did. But l'm not a
criminal. l'm not a criminal...

1430
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:58,112
I'm not a criminal

1431
01:25:59,311 --> 01:26:00,601
Roxie...

1432
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:05,980
Do you recall the night of June 14th?

1433
01:26:06,814 --> 01:26:10,482
Could you tell the jury in your own
words the happenings of that night.

1434
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:15,401
Well when Fred came over,
l told him a good news.

1435
01:26:15,695 --> 01:26:16,985
What was it?

1436
01:26:17,404 --> 01:26:22,906
That me and Amos are gonna have a baby.
And it was all over between us.

1437
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,698
What happened then?

1438
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:26,074
Then...

1439
01:26:29,525 --> 01:26:30,523
Then...

1440
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:32,994
Did he threaten you, Roxie?

1441
01:26:33,287 --> 01:26:34,869
Objection, your honour.
Counsel is leading the witness.

1442
01:26:35,205 --> 01:26:36,204
Sustained.

1443
01:26:39,874 --> 01:26:43,667
What did Casely say
when you told him the news?

1444
01:26:43,877 --> 01:26:47,794
l'll kill you before l see
you have another man's child!

1445
01:26:47,962 --> 01:26:50,378
Could you tell the audience...
the jury, what happened next?

1446
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:55,172
ln his passion, he tore off my robe
and he threw me on the bed.

1447
01:26:55,466 --> 01:26:58,757
And Mr. Hart's pistol
was lying there between us.

1448
01:26:58,969 --> 01:26:59,468
And then!

1449
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,759
And then we both reached for the
gun but l got it first.

1450
01:27:02,095 --> 01:27:05,470
And then he came towards me
with this awny look in his eyes.

1451
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,179
He was angry and wild!

1452
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:08,264
Wild!

1453
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:10,389
And did you think that
he might kill you?

1454
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:11,973
Oh, yes, sir!

1455
01:27:12,183 --> 01:27:13,683
So was his life or yours?

1456
01:27:13,852 --> 01:27:17,768
And l just mine.
l closed my eyes and l shot!

1457
01:27:18,062 --> 01:27:19,477
It is defense for your life!

1458
01:27:19,688 --> 01:27:25,147
To save my husband's
innocent unborn child.

1459
01:27:28,484 --> 01:27:30,860
Order!

1460
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:32,944
What a bull's eye, huh?

1461
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:36,153
-Order in this courtroom!
-Roxie!

1462
01:27:38,364 --> 01:27:40,947
It's come demonian here in the courtroom...

1463
01:27:42,575 --> 01:27:45,659
Mrs. Hart's behavior
has been truly extraordinary.

1464
01:27:46,536 --> 01:27:50,162
Opening her eyes, she fenced herself
with her attorney's handkerchief.

1465
01:27:50,454 --> 01:27:52,537
-Handkerchief?
-Poor child has no relief.

1466
01:27:52,873 --> 01:27:56,248
She looks around now bewildered,
seeming to want something.

1467
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,666
lt's a glass of water.

1468
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:01,041
Oh, Mama, that was my bid!
l told Billy, l'm gonna do that at my trial!

1469
01:28:01,335 --> 01:28:04,127
But now her eyes
flatter wildly and she...

1470
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:07,254
Mrs. Hart has fainted again.

1471
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,632
She flumps over her chiffon dress
up around her knees,

1472
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,840
revealing a glimpse of blue garter
with Ryan-stone buckle.

1473
01:28:14,258 --> 01:28:17,633
Oh, Mama, she stole my garter.
She stole my garter!

1474
01:28:17,928 --> 01:28:19,053
Don't break my radio!

1475
01:28:20,137 --> 01:28:23,345
First the slut steals my publicity,
then she steals my lawyer, my trial date,

1476
01:28:23,556 --> 01:28:24,722
now she stole my goddamn garter.

1477
01:28:25,056 --> 01:28:26,556
What do you expect?

1478
01:28:26,725 --> 01:28:28,432
l mean these days
you get a little success

1479
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:30,725
and it's good rinse
for the people who put you here.

1480
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,854
lt ain't no justice in the world.
That's nothing you can do about it.

1481
01:28:36,923 --> 01:28:37,921
Notes that

1482
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:41,815
You think they got you a page
just to listen to my radio?

1483
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:46,526
People write some public interesting things
when they think no one's looking.

1484
01:28:54,031 --> 01:28:57,031
Oh, Mama.

1485
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,114
State calls a witness.

1486
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:14,830
Left hand on the Bible, raise your right hand
and swear you'd tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but truth swear to God.

1487
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:16,917
Have a seat.

1488
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,000
Would you state your name
for the record please.

1489
01:29:20,295 --> 01:29:21,294
Velma Kelly.

1490
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:24,796
Miss Kelly, would you please tell
the court of the object l'm holding

1491
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:27,589
is the one you happen to come upon
in the defendant jailhouse?

1492
01:29:27,799 --> 01:29:28,798
Yes, it is.

1493
01:29:29,008 --> 01:29:32,925
l submit this as Exhibitdex.
Roxie Hart's diary.

1494
01:29:33,218 --> 01:29:36,218
l object!
My client never kept a diary.

1495
01:29:36,386 --> 01:29:40,303
Even if she did, this would be invasion
of privacy and violation of fourth amendment

1496
01:29:40,597 --> 01:29:42,097
and illegal search without a warrant.

1497
01:29:42,306 --> 01:29:44,597
Yeah, and she broke the law.

1498
01:29:46,184 --> 01:29:47,891
Order!

1499
01:29:48,602 --> 01:29:51,018
Well, let's settle that. l'll allow it.

1500
01:29:51,312 --> 01:29:53,895
What's the big deal?
She's the one that did it.

1501
01:29:54,687 --> 01:29:56,603
lf you would read for us, Miss Kelly.

1502
01:29:57,817 --> 01:29:59,483
l haven't worked in a while.

1503
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:03,899
What a laugh, plucking Fred Casely.

1504
01:30:04,194 --> 01:30:06,276
The big baboon had a common.

1505
01:30:06,487 --> 01:30:09,695
l'm just sorry l
only got to kill him once.

1506
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:13,489
l never wrote that. You...
Hey, she made that up.

1507
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,782
-She made that up!
-Order!

1508
01:30:17,868 --> 01:30:20,493
Please, Mr. Flynn,
get control of your client.

1509
01:30:20,703 --> 01:30:22,078
l'm sorry, you honour.
lt won't happen again.

1510
01:30:22,495 --> 01:30:24,786
Sit down and shut up.
Or else it gonna get worse.

1511
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,497
l have no more questions.

1512
01:30:28,374 --> 01:30:30,081
Your witness, Mr. Flynn.

1513
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:34,875
Ladies and gentlemen, a tap dance.

1514
01:30:41,381 --> 01:30:43,588
Tell me, Miss Kelly,
you make a deal with Mr. Harrison

1515
01:30:45,967 --> 01:30:49,093
maybe to drop all charges against you
in exchange of your testifying today?

1516
01:30:49,385 --> 01:30:51,260
No, sure. l'm not completed yet.

1517
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:54,886
Good.

1518
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:00,055
Then since you gave such an impressive
performance for Mr. Harrison,

1519
01:31:00,266 --> 01:31:01,348
can you do me the same honour?

1520
01:31:01,683 --> 01:31:03,057
-l'd be delighted.
-Thank you.

1521
01:31:05,686 --> 01:31:09,853
Fred Casely assured me to get me
an audition down at the Onyx.

1522
01:31:10,062 --> 01:31:14,855
And then he reneged on his pledge
and that was my motive for attack.

1523
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,065
Pretty fancy. What you're saying

1524
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:19,566
if a big fat liar
who rogue on a deal so l shot him.

1525
01:31:22,862 --> 01:31:24,737
Amos accused me of having an affair.

1526
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:29,447
So l told him that the charge was erroneous.

1527
01:31:29,657 --> 01:31:30,947
Objection, your honour.

1528
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:34,658
Mr. Flynn is twisting the evidence
to draw conclusion to the specious and the...

1529
01:31:34,952 --> 01:31:35,868
-Erroneous?
-Exactly.

1530
01:31:37,953 --> 01:31:40,161
Order!

1531
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,538
Miss Kelly, did you know the
meaning of the word perjury?

1532
01:31:44,831 --> 01:31:45,663
Yes, l do.

1533
01:31:45,956 --> 01:31:47,663
-You also know that is a crime?
-Yes.

1534
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:51,959
And for example if it turns out
you knew this diary was a fake,

1535
01:31:52,252 --> 01:31:54,960
l hate to think you rotting away in
prison for the next 10 years

1536
01:31:55,254 --> 01:31:56,628
especially when you just win your freedom.

1537
01:31:56,963 --> 01:31:58,920
All l know is what l was told.

1538
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:09,052
So... you didn't find this diary in Roxie's cell?

1539
01:32:09,429 --> 01:32:10,719
No.

1540
01:32:11,346 --> 01:32:15,221
Mama... Miss Morton gave it to me.
She said someone sent it to her.

1541
01:32:15,515 --> 01:32:19,141
Someone? Any idea who
this mysterious benefactor might be?

1542
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:21,016
No. She didn't know.

1543
01:32:21,351 --> 01:32:22,641
All right, let's see if it's gonna work so

1544
01:32:22,851 --> 01:32:26,643
Someone who writes about
reneging on pledges.

1545
01:32:26,813 --> 01:32:30,730
And... erroneous charges...

1546
01:32:31,024 --> 01:32:33,315
Call me crazy, does that
sound like a lawyer to you?

1547
01:32:33,609 --> 01:32:38,234
A lawyer, who honestly had
a sample of my client's handwriting.

1548
01:32:38,943 --> 01:32:42,402
Mr. Harrison, did you ask Roxie
to write out a confession for you?

1549
01:32:42,738 --> 01:32:45,238
Yes, but you're not suggesting that
l tempered with evidence, are you?

1550
01:32:45,531 --> 01:32:47,822
No, let's not be ridiculous.

1551
01:32:48,033 --> 01:32:50,615
That's certainly and utterly absurd.

1552
01:32:51,617 --> 01:32:52,699
Unless you mention it.

1553
01:32:53,036 --> 01:32:54,035
Your honour, this is outrageous.

1554
01:32:54,202 --> 01:32:56,535
Outrageous? Yes.

1555
01:32:56,829 --> 01:33:00,330
The prosecutor would made
a thief bargain with notorious  Velma Kelly.

1556
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:03,414
And then fabricated
the very evidence and set her free!

1557
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:12,920
Mr. Flynn, hold your contempt.

1558
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:15,088
No, it's not even conceivable.

1559
01:33:15,422 --> 01:33:17,713
But does it worked?
Would it be time to say,

1560
01:33:18,007 --> 01:33:20,508
Come clean,
Mr. Harrison, come clean...

1561
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:23,592
Even with your , this kind of corruption.
l cannot stand.

1562
01:33:25,386 --> 01:33:26,717
That's enough, Mr. Flynn!

1563
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:29,887
l agree, your honour. That's enough!

1564
01:33:31,681 --> 01:33:33,514
Let defence rest

1565
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:39,310
Ladies and gentlemen,

1566
01:33:39,603 --> 01:33:43,979
this is Mary Sunshine reporting live
from the Cooke County Courthouse.

1567
01:33:44,313 --> 01:33:47,897
The city of Chicago has come
to a complete stand still.

1568
01:33:48,107 --> 01:33:51,774
As the trial of century finally draw to a close.

1569
01:33:51,984 --> 01:33:55,900
Mrs. Hart sits quietly
at the defense table, hands folded.

1570
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:59,486
Wondering what fate has installed for her?

1571
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,571
And how hushing over the courtroom

1572
01:34:01,906 --> 01:34:06,198
as the 12 men of the jury
fall slowly back to their seats.

1573
01:34:07,701 --> 01:34:10,576
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reach a verdict?

1574
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,662
We have, your honour.

1575
01:34:14,498 --> 01:34:16,373
The jury has reached a verdict.

1576
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,875
The defendant please rise.

1577
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:25,086
What is your verdict?

1578
01:34:25,298 --> 01:34:27,674
We, the jury, find the defendant...

1579
01:34:28,009 --> 01:34:29,701
"Guilty"

1580
01:34:29,702 --> 01:34:32,699
"Innocent"

1581
01:34:41,268 --> 01:34:44,060
Roxie Hart is innocent!
She's innocent!

1582
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:45,270
Get your paper

1583
01:34:45,271 --> 01:34:46,688
Roxie Hart is free!

1584
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:47,894
She's free

1585
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:48,894
Roxie

1586
01:35:05,454 --> 01:35:06,161
Come on! Move it!

1587
01:35:06,371 --> 01:35:07,871
She shoots her husband and
she crossed the lawyer!

1588
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:16,169
Hey, don't you wanna take my picture?

1589
01:35:16,879 --> 01:35:19,879
Hey, l'm the famous Roxie Hart.

1590
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:24,549
Hey, what happened?
What the hell happened?

1591
01:35:25,677 --> 01:35:28,470
lt's Chicago, kid.
You can't beat fresh blood on the walls.

1592
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:31,263
What about my publicity, Billy?
My name in the papers.

1593
01:35:31,473 --> 01:35:32,472
l was counting on that.

1594
01:35:32,683 --> 01:35:35,476
Your attitude is not the one l get.
l just save your life.

1595
01:35:35,685 --> 01:35:38,852
You got $5,000.
What do l get? l get nothing.

1596
01:35:39,145 --> 01:35:41,478
Five? Actually it's ten
once l collect from Velma.

1597
01:35:42,148 --> 01:35:43,147
l get nothing?

1598
01:35:44,066 --> 01:35:46,149
Don't forget your diary.

1599
01:35:46,567 --> 01:35:50,860
If you don't mind.
l had a few erroneous phrases in there.

1600
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:55,154
Sorry, l couldn't tell you.

1601
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:56,449
Take a chance.

1602
01:35:58,243 --> 01:35:59,743
Never lost a case.

1603
01:36:03,246 --> 01:36:06,456
You're a free woman, Roxie Hart.

1604
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:09,668
And God save lllinois.

1605
01:36:16,256 --> 01:36:18,048
Roxie.

1606
01:36:23,054 --> 01:36:24,845
What do you want?

1607
01:36:25,847 --> 01:36:27,931
l want you to come home.

1608
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:32,351
You said you still wanted to...
and the baby...

1609
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:34,268
Baby, what baby?

1610
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:39,565
Oh, Jesus.

1611
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:42,233
What do you take me for?

1612
01:36:42,568 --> 01:36:44,735
There ain't no baby.

1613
01:36:46,446 --> 01:36:48,363
There ain't no baby?

1614
01:36:52,827 --> 01:36:56,036
They didn't even want my picture.

1615
01:36:56,246 --> 01:36:59,538
l just can't understand that.

1616
01:37:05,837 --> 01:37:09,129
Why didn't they even want my picture?

1617
01:37:18,444 --> 01:37:21,877
It's good, isn't it?

1618
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:24,011
Grand, isn't it?

1619
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:26,754
Great, isn't it?

1620
01:37:26,756 --> 01:37:29,826
Swell, isn't it?

1621
01:37:29,828 --> 01:37:33,961
Fun, isn't it?

1622
01:37:33,962 --> 01:37:36,233
Nowadays

1623
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:41,737
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Roxie Hart says Good Night.

1624
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,672
There's man, everywhere

1625
01:37:48,672 --> 01:37:50,842
Jazz, everywhere

1626
01:37:50,844 --> 01:37:53,445
Booze, everywhere

1627
01:37:53,447 --> 01:37:56,245
Life, everywhere

1628
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:59,398
Joy, everywhere

1629
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:04,397
Nowadays

1630
01:38:04,785 --> 01:38:09,782
You can like the life you're living

1631
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:14,278
You can live the life you like

1632
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:19,277
You can even marry Harry

1633
01:38:20,053 --> 01:38:24,355
But mess around with Ike

1634
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:28,323
And that's good, isn't it?

1635
01:38:28,324 --> 01:38:30,757
Grand, isn't it?

1636
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,911
Great, isn't it?

1637
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:35,344
Swell, isn't it?

1638
01:38:35,347 --> 01:38:37,847
Fun, isn't it?

1639
01:38:37,847 --> 01:38:43,844
But nothing stays

1640
01:38:51,614 --> 01:38:56,059
You can like the life you're living

1641
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:59,714
You can live the life you like

1642
01:38:59,715 --> 01:39:01,507
Didn't she kill a guy a while back?

1643
01:39:01,717 --> 01:39:04,008
Yeah, who can keep it straight anymore?

1644
01:39:04,541 --> 01:39:07,697
But mess around with Ike

1645
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:10,930
And that's good, isn't it?

1646
01:39:10,931 --> 01:39:13,083
Grand, isn't it?

1647
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:15,042
Great, isn't it?

1648
01:39:15,044 --> 01:39:15,225
Swell, isn't it?

1649
01:39:15,227 --> 01:39:17,394
That's great. We'll be in touch.

1650
01:39:17,728 --> 01:39:19,728
You know l'm not quite finished yet.
l have a...

1651
01:39:20,398 --> 01:39:21,523
Wait, don't go.

1652
01:39:21,731 --> 01:39:24,607
l could... just a second I'm not...

1653
01:39:25,318 --> 01:39:26,818
Goddamn it!

1654
01:39:29,195 --> 01:39:30,111
Thank you!

1655
01:39:31,405 --> 01:39:32,904
Here's your music, honey.

1656
01:39:39,996 --> 01:39:41,413
Thanks.

1657
01:39:51,713 --> 01:39:54,505
You know you're really pretty good.

1658
01:39:56,217 --> 01:39:57,008
Yeah.

1659
01:39:59,594 --> 01:40:01,301
What are you doing here?

1660
01:40:01,803 --> 01:40:04,596
l've been making around.

1661
01:40:04,889 --> 01:40:07,180
Well, if not fooled up by you,
l'll be swinging right now.

1662
01:40:07,391 --> 01:40:09,016
Come on, l was there to get you off.

1663
01:40:09,184 --> 01:40:10,892
You should learn how
to put things behind you.

1664
01:40:11,102 --> 01:40:13,603
Thank you.
l'll put that at the top of my list

1665
01:40:13,813 --> 01:40:16,480
right after finding a job
and an apartment with a john.

1666
01:40:16,815 --> 01:40:17,981
Can you shut up and listen to me?

1667
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:19,981
You really are something.

1668
01:40:20,193 --> 01:40:26,780
Coming in here like some goddamn queen bee,
full of advice for a poor slob like me.

1669
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:29,782
Let me tell you something,
Miss Velma Kelly.

1670
01:40:29,993 --> 01:40:31,700
l got a new life now.

1671
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:34,910
And one of the best thing about it,
is it don't include you.

1672
01:40:35,204 --> 01:40:36,580
Fine. l just thought we could
help each other out.

1673
01:40:36,914 --> 01:40:38,204
Wait, you thought wrong, didn't you?

1674
01:40:38,415 --> 01:40:39,997
Now look, listen to me.

1675
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:42,875
Look l talked to this guy downtown.

1676
01:40:43,085 --> 01:40:47,296
He says one chance hurts nothing
these days, but two...

1677
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:58,596
We can make a couple hundred a week.

1678
01:40:58,889 --> 01:40:59,971
Think about it, Roxie.

1679
01:41:00,306 --> 01:41:03,306
Our faces back in the papers
our names in the market.

1680
01:41:03,476 --> 01:41:06,393
Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart.

1681
01:41:06,603 --> 01:41:08,478
Shouldn't it be alphabetical?

1682
01:41:08,897 --> 01:41:10,104
That could work.

1683
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:13,690
A couple hundred?
Maybe we can ask for a thousand.

1684
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:14,983
We'll worth it.

1685
01:41:17,487 --> 01:41:20,904
Forget it, it'll never work.

1686
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:23,780
-Why not?
-'Cause l hate you.

1687
01:41:24,283 --> 01:41:28,369
There's only one business in the
world that's no problem at all.

1688
01:41:37,877 --> 01:41:41,795
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chicago
theatre is proud to announce the first.

1689
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:46,465
The first time anywhere
that's been an act out of this nation.

1690
01:41:46,759 --> 01:41:49,594
Not only one little lady, but two.

1691
01:41:49,761 --> 01:41:53,178
You read about them in the papers,
and now here they are.

1692
01:41:53,389 --> 01:41:57,474
Chicago zone killer-dealers, the lady-sinners,

1693
01:41:57,893 --> 01:42:00,893
Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly!

1694
01:42:03,003 --> 01:42:08,000
You can like the life you're living

1695
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:12,658
You can live the life you like

1696
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:17,657
You can even marry Harry

1697
01:42:17,826 --> 01:42:21,969
But mess around with Ike

1698
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:25,447
And that's good, isn't it?

1699
01:42:25,447 --> 01:42:27,714
Grand, isn't it?

1700
01:42:27,717 --> 01:42:29,972
Great, isn't it?

1701
01:42:29,974 --> 01:42:32,527
Swell, isn't it?

1702
01:42:32,528 --> 01:42:35,192
Fun, isn't it?

1703
01:42:35,193 --> 01:42:40,049
But nothing stays

1704
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:44,123
In fifty years or so

1705
01:42:44,126 --> 01:42:48,336
It's gonna change, you know

1706
01:42:48,337 --> 01:42:53,334
But, oh, it's heaven

1707
01:42:53,697 --> 01:42:58,145
Nowadays

1708
01:42:58,147 --> 01:43:00,772
Okay, you babes of Jazz,
Let's pick up the pace.

1709
01:43:01,065 --> 01:43:03,441
Let's make the party longer,
let's make the skirt shorter.

1710
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:06,151
Let's all go to hell
in a fast car and KEEP IT HOT

1711
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:07,619
Me and Roxie would just like to say thank you.

1712
01:45:08,245 --> 01:45:09,536
Thank you!

1713
01:45:10,038 --> 01:45:14,832
Believe us, we could've never
done anything without you!

1714
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:25,681
And all that Jazz

1715
01:45:33,372 --> 01:45:35,370
That Jazz
