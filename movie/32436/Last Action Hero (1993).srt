1
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,709
This is squad, we got him here.

2
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,268
We have a positive ID. It is the Ripper.
Repeat, it is the Ripper.

3
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,389
This is one hell of a way
to spend Christmas.

4
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,108
- Mulcahey!
- Sir.

5
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,589
- Secure the sidewalk. No one in or out.
- Yes, sir.

6
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,428
Got a present for you. Pigs!

7
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,469
Damn you! Let the children go!
Damn you, Ripper! Let the children go!

8
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:20,549
Slater! Don't even think it, Slater,
you hear me?

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,509
You're gonna sit and wait
for the real hostage negotiator!

10
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,029
God damn it, Jack, I'm talking to you!

11
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:30,629
The last time you pulled this jive, jitterbug,
tough gonad shit,

12
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,549
people lost body parts!

13
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,749
Now, you go in there and it's your badge!

14
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,148
Jack! I know, as mayor
of this great metropolis,

15
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,748
you and I have had our little tiffs,
but this is the Lieutenant Governor.

16
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,709
- Slater, here's what I...
- When the governor gets here, call me.

17
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:52,189
Slater's attempting to enter.
Do not let him in. Repeat, do not let him in.

18
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,748
- Piece of cake.
- Hey.

19
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:58,349
You want to be a farmer?
Here's a couple of acres.

20
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,188
- Dekker, the next one I'll hurt.
- Slater, don't go in...

21
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,868
Check fire. There's an officer in the building.
I say again,

22
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,669
there's a plain-clothes officer
in the building!

23
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,868
- Jack, what kept you?
- Dad!

24
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,909
Andy here's been getting nervous.
I promised him you'd come.

25
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,668
Gave him my word of honor
he could watch you die.

26
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,148
- Lose the cannon.
- Has he hurt you, Andrew?

27
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:47,108
Hurt, Jack? You say "hurt"?
What do you know about hurt, Jack?

28
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,348
- You put me in a cage for 10 years.
- You should have gotten the death penalty.

29
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,348
Yeah, would've, should've, could've.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

30
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,348
Things crawling around in your head.
Sitting on my chest when I wake up.

31
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,429
Do you know what that's like, Jack?

32
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:07,028
It was your illegal search
that rendered the bloody ax inadmissible.

33
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,548
Remember, Jack? Now lose the gun.

34
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:27,148
All right, I'm unarmed. So let the boy go.

35
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,829
Just one gun, Jack? You got to be kidding.

36
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,908
- Is that all, sport?
- Yep, that about does it.

37
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:58,868
Then step away.

38
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,308
Chop-chop.

39
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,869
Oh, unless you consider this a weapon.

40
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,709
Brilliant, Jack. Brilliant. I surrender.

41
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,829
- It's a live grenade.
- Yeah, right, Jack. Right, right.

42
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,229
You're going to sacrifice your own child
to get to me.

43
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:30,989
I'm very flattered, Jack, but I doubt it.

44
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,709
Andy, pick up the grenade. Go on.

45
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,148
Show it to me. That's good. Right there.

46
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,429
Jack, that toy can't hurt the boy,

47
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,669
but this one can.

48
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,268
Focus!

49
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,029
Hey, come on! Focus!

50
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:27,308
- Hey, people are trying to sleep.
- Yeah, right.

51
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:33,269
The film is out of focus.
The film is out... Never mind.

52
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,229
Nick!

53
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,868
Nick.

54
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,149
Nick?

55
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,228
Nick, you okay?

56
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,069
- What?
- The climax is on the fritz.

57
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,228
All right. All right.

58
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,549
I never used to do that, Danny.

59
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,749
It's okay.

60
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,749
I've seen this Slater six times.
I just got worried.

61
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,108
You know, the new Jack Slater
opens this weekend at the Odyssey.

62
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,788
Like I didn't know that.

63
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,789
"They killed his second cousin.
Big mistake."

64
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,789
"Jack Slater IV"

65
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,389
Well, I'm checking the print tonight,
midnight. Just myself.

66
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:50,509
I could arrange for you to gain admittance,
that is, you know,

67
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,229
if that sort of thing appeals to you.

68
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,829
- See it before it opens?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,308
- Who do I have to kill?
- Nobody. All you have to do is get to school.

70
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,669
You know, if you hurry,
you're only going to be four hours late.

71
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,549
Treachery, conspiracy,
sex, sword fights, madness, ghosts.

72
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:35,108
And in the end, everybody dies.

73
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,509
Shakespeare's Hamlet
couldn't be more exciting.

74
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:43,549
And though it may seem
that he is incapable of taking any action,

75
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:49,069
he is, in fact, one of the first action heroes.

76
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:57,068
What you are going to see
is a scene from the film by Laurence Olivier.

77
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,188
Some of you might have seen him in
the Polaroid commercial,

78
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,708
or as Zeus in Clash of the Titans.

79
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,749
O, bosom, black as death!

80
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,189
Help, angels!

81
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,428
All may yet be well.

82
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,429
Now he's praying, and now I'll do it.

83
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,828
And so he goes to heaven.

84
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,988
Don't talk. Just do it.

85
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:49,708
Hey, Claudius.

86
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,669
You killed my father.

87
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,268
Big mistake.

88
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,949
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,

89
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,709
and Hamlet is taking out the trash.

90
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,748
- Stay thy hand, fair prince.
- Who said I'm fair?

91
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,028
No one's going to tell this sweet prince,
"Good night".

92
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,148
To be or not to be.

93
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,388
Not to be.

94
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,749
The whole morning? He wasn't.

95
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:03,869
No, I said, "He wasn't".
He wasn't at school today.

96
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:05,828
He's sick as a lamb, poor dog.

97
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,588
Regale me with the story of your life
starting this morning, 8:30, first period,

98
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,148
American history and make this really good.

99
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,148
I mean something along the lines of,
"I cut so I could donate a kidney".

100
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:28,709
You were at the movies again, weren't you?
And that crazy old guy is an accessory.

101
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,908
- Nick's not crazy.
- Damn it, Danny!

102
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,308
You know, I'm in there, lying to a principal,
me, a charter member of the PTA.

103
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,989
And what for? So you can go to the movies?

104
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,508
Sorry.

105
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:49,629
I didn't choose any of this. I didn't choose it.
I didn't say, "Hey, what the hell,

106
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,308
"let me see what it would be like
to be a widow before I'm 40, give that a try."

107
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,909
- I know that.
- Give me a hug.

108
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,748
- I won't cut again.
- Let me hear the "p" word on that.

109
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,668
- Promise.
- All right.

110
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,948
Oh, Jesus! I'm late. I got to get to work.
All right.

111
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:16,389
Lock the top lock
the minute I close the door, okay?

112
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,508
And do not open this door for anyone.

113
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,868
- Bye.
- Bye.

114
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,948
She called her mother in
and they're trying to do something about it.

115
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,428
They had cereal bugs.
I can't wait to see the new...

116
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,949
...continue to be a big problem...

117
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:30,988
Come here often?

118
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,709
Ron Rice for one reason.

119
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,108
What you eating?

120
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,428
Nothing, maggots.

121
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,069
You alone? Okay. Move it!

122
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,108
Do yourself to the drain.

123
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,588
Tough guy.

124
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,669
Do it. I'll make it easier for you.

125
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,069
Go ahead.

126
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,749
Do it.

127
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:53,349
What is it with you? You got junk!

128
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,829
No jewelry, no VCR.
A shit TV that will get me 20 bucks.

129
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,429
Go fish, amigo.

130
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,428
Remember now, your mom says
you're to go straight home.

131
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,629
- She'll be there when the shift is over.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,388
If we find the guy, I'll give you a call.

133
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,429
Nick!

134
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,509
Come on.

135
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,589
- I about gave up on you.
- Sorry.

136
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:12,268
- Well, what do you think?
- Well, I've never seen anything like it.

137
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,949
- It's not too tight, is it?
- No, no. It's... It's the style.

138
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,269
I always wanted to be a magician,
but my hands, they were just too tiny.

139
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:30,869
My father, he was bookkeeper here
and he got me my first job.

140
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,548
Usher. It was still a vaudeville house.
Then I worked myself up to projectionist.

141
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,029
It's not much, but it's still show biz.

142
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,269
So... Is the print ready to roll?

143
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:51,989
Just a minute, young man.
Aren't we forgetting something?

144
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,269
A ticket.

145
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,428
You got to have a ticket, Danny, to see
a movie, and have I got just the one.

146
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:05,709
See, when I was about your age,
Harry Houdini played this theater

147
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:09,068
and my pop took me backstage to see him
after the show.

148
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,188
And he made a gesture, Houdini did.
Like this.

149
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,509
And all of a sudden, this was in his hand.

150
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,508
And he said to me, he whispered,
he said, "This is a magic ticket.

151
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,948
"It was given to me
by the best magician in India,

152
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,749
"and it was given to him
by the best magician in Tibet.

153
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:32,549
"It's a passport to another world.

154
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:36,589
"It was mine, and now it's yours."

155
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,029
And now it's yours.

156
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:47,748
What does it do, Nick?

157
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,789
I never had the courage to find out.

158
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,669
I had the ticket for years
and I wanted to try,

159
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,869
but I guess I was afraid it wouldn't work.

160
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,909
See, when I was your age,
Houdini was like a god to me.

161
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,829
But what if he was faking?

162
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,789
And then again,

163
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,988
what if it did work?

164
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,028
Yeah, well, what if it did?

165
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:16,428
Well, Houdini said something else to me.

166
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,269
He said, "This ticket has a mind of its own.

167
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,428
"It does what it wants to do."

168
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,549
And that always made me just a little edgy.

169
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:36,588
Well, I guess there's only one way
to find out, then, right?

170
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,908
Please retain your stub, sir.

171
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,628
Shall we see if Mr. Slater wins this time?

172
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,909
Jack Slater can't lose!
Never has, never will.

173
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,709
Oh, Frankie.

174
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,308
Frank. Frankie.

175
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:52,189
Frankie, why you keep on with the insults?

176
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,349
- I would never insult you, Mr. Vivaldi.
- When you lie, that's an insult.

177
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,909
I know you're Jack Slater's
favorite second cousin in the whole world.

178
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:08,468
You all the time talk to each other.
I got to know what Slater knows,

179
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,909
and you are going to tell me, huh?

180
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:19,629
Does he know that my mob and Torelli's mob
have just signed a secret pact

181
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,029
to control...

182
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:26,948
To control all the drugs
in Southern California?

183
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,468
We mostly talk muzzle velocities.

184
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,949
Guns.

185
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,749
Meet Mr. Benedict.

186
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,629
The genuine article.
And, you'd better believe it.

187
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:02,549
Sometimes, he likes to bake
while he's shooting people.

188
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,788
What I'm saying is Mr. Benedict
can take you out as easy as cake.

189
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:15,348
Pie, you Sicilian schmuck.

190
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,348
The man is a surgeon.

191
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,269
You want me to make him operate on you?

192
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,309
I swear, I don't know.

193
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,229
Dump him at his place, huh?
But take it easy.

194
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:49,388
He bought it.

195
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,869
He actually believes
me and old man Torelli are banding together.

196
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,629
Beauty part is, nobody knows different.
Not till after the funeral.

197
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,389
Then everybody knows.

198
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,508
Everybody knows Tony Vivaldi

199
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:17,908
is number one.

200
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:22,909
You are going to pay.
Oh, are you going to pay.

201
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,029
Are you sure this is the right address?
This don't look like no crack house to me.

202
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:32,349
What do you want?
Sixty guys dancing on the lawn,

203
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,468
throwing cocaine at each other?
Just kick the door in.

204
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,229
What's up, guys?

205
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:55,068
- Quiet. This is a drug bust.
- A drug bust?

206
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,148
You must be joking.
My second cousin Frank lives in there.

207
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,188
The only drugs you'll find in there
are aspirin.

208
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:06,988
And if you touch that front door,
you're going to need them.

209
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:10,909
Maybe there's been a mistake.
We received an anonymous tip.

210
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,228
Frank? Frank? Frank?

211
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,549
Frank?

212
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,388
- Frank.
- Jack...

213
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:38,548
Jack, listen to me.

214
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,029
- Who did this?
- Listen to me. This is important.

215
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,468
Tony Vivaldi and the Torelli mob

216
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,829
are joining forces.

217
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:55,749
I'm out of here.

218
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,189
Frank. Frank!

219
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,589
I'm sorry, Frank.

220
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,908
It's a bomb!

221
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,828
He's okay. Minor wound. Both cops dead.

222
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,668
Two days to retirement.

223
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,069
Nick? Hello?

224
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,588
Nick!

225
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:43,708
Who the hell are you?

226
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,469
Don't shoot me.
I'm Danny Madigan, I'm a kid.

227
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,589
How did you get here?

228
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,668
I'm not quite sure where "here" is, sir,
but I don't think you want to know.

229
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,629
Okay, close your eyes,
stay flat and don't move.

230
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,188
You're driving with no hands.

231
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,788
You think it's easy?
You have to practice a lot

232
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,109
and never ever do it in heavy traffic.

233
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,309
Iced that guy. To "cone" a phrase.

234
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,868
Wait a minute. The bad puns, the voice,
the hard rock.

235
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:54,708
This is happening.
This is really happening.

236
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,949
This is not happening.
Repeat, this is not hap...

237
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,789
Oh, no!

238
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,229
I booted. Sorry.
I thought I was going to die.

239
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,748
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

240
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,988
but you're going to live to enjoy
all the glorious fruits life has to offer,

241
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:43,029
acne, shaving, premature ejaculation
and your first divorce.

242
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,428
Boy, does this suck weenie
or what?

243
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,389
This is a movie set.

244
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,549
This is a movie set.
That's how the scenery changed, right?

245
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,828
You're going to play chicken, aren't you?
Just like Jack Slater.

246
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,589
Fasten your seat belt, please.

247
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:42,229
Your fingers?

248
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,029
Cross as many as you can.

249
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,149
I'm in the movie.
Holy cow, I'm in the movie!

250
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:38,388
Nick, Houdini wasn't faking.

251
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:10,749
Jack, did you see that?

252
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,349
I was just in a real police station
and this is much nicer.

253
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,189
Hey, Slater, it's your ex-wife on two.

254
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,628
You stay. She's always calling me.

255
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,549
Hello, sweetheart, how are you?
It's so nice to hear your voice.

256
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:41,068
- Oiler, you're partnered up with Waterman.
- Give me a partner, Sarge.

257
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,509
That is right.

258
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,189
Yep. Of course. No, just as you say.

259
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,588
Yep.

260
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,549
Krause, you're teamed up with the rabbi.

261
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,988
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,029
- How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
- Practice!

263
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,589
John Practice, you old SOB.
What are you doing away from Washington?

264
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,109
The bureau thinks something strange
is going on between...

265
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:24,189
And this is top secret...

266
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,549
I know. The Vivaldi mob is joining forces
with the Torellis.

267
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,189
Damn it, Jack, how do you do that?

268
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,709
Well, I'm not parked behind a desk all day
eating those donuts.

269
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:36,709
Those are government donuts, my friend.
It's not easy work. I got to call DC.

270
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,869
Good for you.

271
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,908
Watch it, Jack. He killed Mozart.

272
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,469
- In a movie?
- Amadeus. It won eight Oscars.

273
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,268
I saved his life in Nam.
I'll make sure to be on the lookout. Thanks.

274
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,669
Now, no more movies!

275
00:32:57,629 --> 00:32:59,948
Slater!

276
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,588
I got the city council chewing my eggs off
for that plane you crashed!

277
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,188
I got the mayor scheduling parades,
up my Lincoln tunnel

278
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,708
for that stunt you pulled on the beach!

279
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,548
Everybody wants to know,
what it is, what it ain't and what it will be!

280
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,509
- Do I make myself clear?
- I'm just doing my job.

281
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,988
You've given this department
the worst reputation in the country.

282
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,869
Now I've got the Chamber of Commerce
doing cartwheels in my cocoa factory.

283
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:27,069
Radcliff, you're pulling duty
with the animated cat.

284
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,548
Hiya, toots.

285
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:35,988
- I'm getting a flea bath later. Join me?
- You touch me again, fur ball...

286
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,949
- Wait! I can prove this is a movie.
- Who the hell are you, kid?

287
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:42,588
Look out there, there's a cartoon cat.

288
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,948
He's supposed to be back on duty.

289
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,229
He was only suspended for a month.
Now, shut up.

290
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,229
Listen to what I'm saying.

291
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:53,789
An animated cat just walked
into the squad room. Hello.

292
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:56,028
He'll do it again tomorrow.
So what's your point?

293
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,469
- That cat is one of the best men I got!
- Yeah.

294
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,508
Now who is this twerp?
And why is that smile on his face?

295
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,509
I just love the way you two fight,

296
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:05,669
knowing how you really feel
about each other.

297
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:09,588
Pray tell, just how do I feel about
this weird-looking sack of puppy poop?

298
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,389
You're dearest friends.
After your wife left you for the circus midget

299
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,109
and Jack told everyone he drove her to
New England to the diphtheria clinic.

300
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,149
When he came back, you said,

301
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,508
"You saved me from public humiliation,
Jack.

302
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,588
"You're my dearest friend."

303
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,309
- And you promised me you wouldn't tell.
- I didn't.

304
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,189
- Then how did he know?
- Jack Slater I.

305
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,069
- What's winning got to do with this?
- No! The very first Jack Slater.

306
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,628
You told your dad?

307
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,869
I didn't tell anyone.
I don't even know this kid.

308
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,909
Well, he seems to know a lot about us.

309
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,349
No such number. No such name.

310
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,468
The state of New York's never heard of you,
Mr. Madigan.

311
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,989
- What's your real name?
- Danny Madigan.

312
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:54,269
- Where are you really from?
- 355...

313
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:55,828
- How did you get in the car?
- I...

314
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:01,389
I fell off a walk over a bridge.
Slipped into your car.

315
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,149
He saved my life.

316
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,148
Truth at last. Now, why were they after you?

317
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,269
My second cousin Frank
found out some crucial drug information.

318
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,829
I wouldn't put too much faith
into what Vivaldi told him.

319
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:21,709
- How do you know Frank mentioned Vivaldi?
- I know a lot about what's going on.

320
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,749
Now if you will just listen to me...

321
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,028
All right, son,
I've got the perfect listener for you.

322
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:30,309
- Meet your new partner.
- Oh, no.

323
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,309
Better to die.

324
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,788
You're going to love it, Jack. I mean,
we're perfect buddy-movie material.

325
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,628
I'll teach you to be vulnerable,
you'll teach me to be brave.

326
00:35:42,189 --> 00:35:44,668
Hi. I'm Jack Slater's new partner.

327
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:48,709
Jack and I will be working together
for the duration of the film.

328
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,549
You know I'm right.

329
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:55,468
If this was the real world, I mean,
they wouldn't make me your partner.

330
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,948
They'd assign me to a social worker.

331
00:35:58,109 --> 00:35:59,149
Here's one.

332
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,949
Tell me how I know they tortured Frank
and then stashed him behind his front door.

333
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:06,549
Because I saw it all on screen,
because this is a movie.

334
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:09,789
You're very clever. And the only reason
why I'm not roaring with laughter

335
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,989
is because someone killed
my favorite second cousin and that's a...

336
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:16,348
Big mistake.
That is what you were going to say, right?

337
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,789
- Gee, how would I know that?
- No one likes a smart-ass.

338
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,308
Okay. Then shoot me.

339
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,229
That's right. Take your gun,
point it at my head and pull the trigger.

340
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,708
Come on, do it. I double dare you.

341
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,029
You're not going to do it, are you?
And do you know why?

342
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:38,388
Because people like you
don't kill kids in movies.

343
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,708
Because, believe it or not,
Jack, you're the good guy.

344
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,269
You really believe that we're inside a movie,
don't you?

345
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,228
- Yes!
- All right.

346
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,869
I'll give you 10 minutes to prove it
and then I shoot you.

347
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:57,309
Slater!

348
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:01,308
- Quick, where are the Schwarzenegger films?
- Foreign films are in the back.

349
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,708
- No, action. This guy's an action star.
- Down the center on the left.

350
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,228
No. It isn't possible.

351
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:21,789
What's not possible? He's fantastic.
This is his best performance ever.

352
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:26,909
- But that was you. You were in that movie.
- You were in a movie?

353
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,788
Yes. It was called The Girl of My Dreams.

354
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,548
It starred you.

355
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,149
As a matter of fact,
we had this very romantic scene together.

356
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:42,509
- What's the phone number of this store?
- 555-2310.

357
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,989
Okay. What's your home number?

358
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:48,989
That's okay. You can give it to him.
I'm a police officer.

359
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:52,468
- 555-3812.
- Amazing.

360
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,669
I'm willing to bet
that everyone has a 555 number.

361
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:57,309
- So?
- So...

362
00:37:57,389 --> 00:38:01,869
There can only be 9,999 numbers
that start with 555.

363
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:05,228
- How many people live in LA?
- Eight or nine million.

364
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,709
That's why we have area codes.

365
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,708
- Is this your kid?
- This? Oh, no.

366
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,669
This is a mental patient and I'm going to
take him downtown. Come on.

367
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:20,188
Okay, I got one.
What about this girl right here?

368
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,468
She is way too attractive
to be working at a video store.

369
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,908
I agree with you.
I think she should be working with us.

370
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:29,309
Undercover, of course.

371
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:33,309
Look, the point is
there are no unattractive women here.

372
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,669
I mean, where are the ordinary,
every-day women?

373
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,708
- They don't exist, because this is a movie.
- No. This is California.

374
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,788
And by the way, thanks.

375
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,669
I think it was really slick,
the way you got this girl's phone number.

376
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,829
Okay, Mr. Non-believer.

377
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,229
I'll take you to the house
where your cousin Frank was tortured.

378
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,989
I've seen it, on screen.

379
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:02,229
It's kind of like that one, except it's got to be
on the other side of the road

380
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,468
'cause it's got an ocean view.

381
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,349
Listen, there's something
you don't understand.

382
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,388
This ticket is magic, and it really works.

383
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,828
Any second we're going to drive
right into a theater.

384
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:22,509
Maybe I need to warm it up first.

385
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:26,909
Of course. My decoder ring has to warm up,
too. All the time.

386
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,229
Okay, okay. The house looked European.

387
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:32,549
Like maybe you get a postcard
from Italy or something.

388
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:36,909
Like that one. In fact, just like that one.

389
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,349
The bad guys are in there.

390
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:45,228
You know something?
I think you should be wearing this.

391
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:48,309
- I don't think I've earned it yet.
- You don't understand.

392
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:50,268
You just solved the entire case.

393
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,189
You just revolutionized
the entire history of police training.

394
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:56,389
I mean, all these years at the academy,
studying human character,

395
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,668
psyche of the terrorist, fingerprint analysis.

396
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,909
All the courses that I've taken
in surveillance,

397
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,708
hostage negotiation
and criminal psychology...

398
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,549
When all I had to do is just drive around
the neighborhood

399
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:08,149
and point my finger at the house and say,

400
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:10,349
"The bad guys are in there."

401
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:14,229
- You think you're funny, don't you?
- I know I am.

402
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,829
I'm the famous comedian,
Arnold Braunschweiger.

403
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:19,068
- Schwarzenegger.
- Gesundheit.

404
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:35,709
May I help you?

405
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:38,869
Yes. Could I speak to the drug dealer
of the house please?

406
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,348
I beg your pardon?

407
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,788
It's a beautiful day
and we're out killing drug dealers.

408
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:46,068
Are there any in the house?

409
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:51,789
Be ready for anything.

410
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,629
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

411
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,629
You didn't know I was going to say that,
did you?

412
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,628
- That's what you always say.
- I do?

413
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:08,028
Everybody keeps waiting
for you to work it in.

414
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,549
It's kind of like your calling card.

415
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:15,389
I understand you're interested
in drug dealers.

416
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:16,548
Yes.

417
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,749
Jack, that's him,
the henchman with the glass eye.

418
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,868
Sir, are you a henchman?

419
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,829
No. I only go as far as lackey.
Will there be anything else?

420
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:30,029
Yeah. Take off your sunglasses.

421
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,229
- Who's asking?
- The tin man.

422
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,308
- Well, tin man, suppose you hit the bricks.
- No. They're the wrong color.

423
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,069
Are they? Oh, dear. By all means, let's
change them. Would arterial red suit you?

424
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:53,389
Make no mistake.
They are exceptionally well-trained.

425
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,749
I snap my fingers again,
and some time tomorrow

426
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:03,468
you emerge from several canine recta.

427
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:07,308
Or you and Toto can go back to
the land of Oz.

428
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,149
- Questions?
- Yeah.

429
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:11,989
Two of them.

430
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,948
Why am I wasting time
on a dime store putz like you

431
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,149
when I could be doing something
much more dangerous?

432
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:21,629
Like rearranging my sock drawers.

433
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,548
And two, how exactly are you going to
snap your fingers

434
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,909
after I rip off both of your thumbs?

435
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,429
Have a nice day.

436
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:46,348
He had one with a bull's-eye
when he was with your second cousin.

437
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,548
He hates his boss.
He calls him a Sicilian schmuck.

438
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,709
How did Slater find out? Will you tell me?

439
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:13,908
I want him to join me, but he's nuts.
He keeps going after the bad guys.

440
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,909
Where is it written I'm a bad guy?

441
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:19,749
Find out who talked and have him killed.

442
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:21,829
Then, Slater.

443
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:25,949
Hey. Hey!

444
00:43:26,029 --> 00:43:27,508
What's with you?

445
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,309
We should change
the funeral arrangements.

446
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:34,269
Are you crazy?
When I say bloodbath, there is

447
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,509
- a bloodbath.
- A bloodbath.

448
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,229
I'm going to find out more
about Slater's short friend.

449
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:44,829
Come on, Jack.

450
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:47,548
That guy has got to be guilty of something.

451
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,428
Yeah. He's guilty of acting like an asshole.

452
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,428
If I arrest him,
I have to arrest half of Congress.

453
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,989
Why did we park back there?

454
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:56,588
In case my ex-wife is around.

455
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,189
Don't worry, she's not.
Her name wasn't in the credits.

456
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:03,789
Kid, who does the doctor treat?

457
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,228
Patients.

458
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,708
Look at the elbow of my jacket.
What is it doing?

459
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,028
- Wearing thin?
- Bingo.

460
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,069
Geez, that was a stretch.

461
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,349
Wow! Is this
what you drive on the weekends?

462
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,669
No, this is my little girl's car.

463
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,549
Come on. Knock on the door.

464
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,589
I told you, your ex-wife's not home.

465
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,268
Her name wasn't in the credits.

466
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,749
Meredith?

467
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,549
I hope you mean Whitney.

468
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:38,428
Sorry. Whitney.

469
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,628
You're not Skeezy, are you?

470
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,948
Daddy! Oh, my God.

471
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,829
- Daddy!
- You've gained some weight.

472
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:55,308
Hi. I'm Danny Madigan
and I realize I haven't had that long of a life,

473
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:00,189
but I just want you to know that
from now on, it's all going to be downhill.

474
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,069
- Hello, sweetheart, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

475
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,749
So, who's your friend? He's cute.

476
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,429
No, he's not cute, he's hopelessly insane.

477
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:13,228
Very soon he's gonna tell you
he loved you in Gone with the Wind.

478
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,509
- This is her first movie.
- You see?

479
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,749
- Now who is Skeezy?
- It's just a sorority thing, Dad. What they do

480
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,229
is they assign you a freshman, and
when he comes to the door, you kiss him.

481
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,589
- Do you have to kiss him?
- Dad, would you come on?

482
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:30,108
Okay, would you grab the phone
and if it's for me, I'll be out of the shower

483
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,428
in less than one hour for sure.

484
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,949
What a cutie.

485
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,949
It's old evidence. Counterfeit case.
Looks real, doesn't it?

486
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:44,349
Turns funny colors when you burn it.

487
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,629
Try using it for alimony.

488
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,549
What's wrong?

489
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:04,668
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?

490
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,989
"I'll be back". I know, I know.

491
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,949
Dad! Dad!

492
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,148
He would have been your age.

493
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,428
I know.

494
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:18,068
The Ripper killed him three years ago.
Pulled him down off the roof.

495
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:21,228
Your dad saw everything.

496
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,229
How did you know all that?

497
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,108
Your pop gets in the papers a lot.
I'm interested in crime stories.

498
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,348
- That's Skeezy.
- I'll get rid of him.

499
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,988
Hello, Toto.

500
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,509
There, there, and there.

501
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:56,588
No! Let go of me! Let go of me!

502
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,668
- Stop it!
- Evening. Uncle Jack around?

503
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,428
Mr. Slater's off tracking a lead somewhere.

504
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:09,269
Joey, would you teach her
the virtue of silence?

505
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:11,788
- Right.
- Benedict.

506
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,829
- If you harm a hair on her head...
- Stop!

507
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,869
Go away! Stop it! No!

508
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,669
You were saying?

509
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:43,669
Now, I believe
it was Sherlock Holmes who said

510
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,429
that if you eliminate
all the logical solutions to a problem,

511
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:51,028
the illogical, however impossible,
is invariably true.

512
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:55,749
You see, I know
that your name is Daniel Madigan.

513
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,749
What I don't understand
is how you know mine.

514
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,548
Slater showed me some mug shots.
We made your face easy.

515
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:10,108
Daniel Madigan from New York City.

516
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,468
Awfully long way away from home,
aren't you? When did you get here?

517
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,549
Just.

518
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:18,269
And how do you know
what I said on Vivaldi's terrace?

519
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:21,348
I heard a recording.

520
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,788
Microphones in the statues, are there?

521
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,869
You wouldn't believe how many.

522
00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:29,828
And the eye I was wearing?

523
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,509
I saw it. I saw it in a movie.

524
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,148
There are micro cameras in the statues.

525
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:41,829
I should tell you that I have killed people
smarter and younger than you.

526
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,588
Look, whatever this is,
it's between you and Slater.

527
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,909
There's some money in the desk.
Take it and leave me and Meredith...

528
00:49:57,989 --> 00:49:59,509
Whitney alone.

529
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,229
Holy shit, boss.

530
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:07,988
It looks like 2K in here.

531
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,269
Just a minute.

532
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,828
Give it to me.

533
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,788
These bills are marked, aren't they?

534
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:25,069
You were trying to sucker me
with marked bills, weren't you?

535
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,069
Burn it.

536
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,948
- Burn it?
- Yes, burn it.

537
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:36,628
Don't play games with grownups, little boy.
You'll get hurt.

538
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,269
Stop it! Stop it! Oh, God.

539
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,948
Big mistake.

540
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:19,069
It's great, isn't it?

541
00:51:19,149 --> 00:51:22,469
Now, we'll hurt you just a little bit,
but you'll...

542
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:23,869
Freeze!

543
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:27,668
Lose the guns or I redecorate
in brain-matter gray, got it?

544
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,229
Yes!

545
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:33,589
You kill me and I'll kill him.

546
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,348
Leave it. Get the door.

547
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,868
Boss?

548
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,188
Hi.

549
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,109
Don't give up your day job.

550
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:06,629
Jack!

551
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,788
Don't leave home without it.

552
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,509
Go!

553
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:24,309
Where are you going?

554
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,989
Got to catch the red-eye.

555
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:40,108
I don't believe this. I'm in the movie, and...

556
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,508
I'm in the movie,
and I'm missing the best action!

557
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:50,309
Punch it. Let's get the hell out of here.

558
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,708
Go back up to the top!

559
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:16,748
Next time, we get thicker armor.

560
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,228
Like a tank.

561
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:40,109
Chicken, it is.

562
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:54,549
This is gonna work. It's a movie.
I'm a good guy. This has got to work!

563
00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:00,468
I'm a comedy sidekick.

564
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:04,109
Oh, shit! I'm a comedy sidekick!

565
00:55:04,189 --> 00:55:07,468
It's not gonna work!

566
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,988
Well, I think I scared him pretty good.

567
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,188
You did great. Come on.

568
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,109
- Benedict's got the ticket.
- That's too bad.

569
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,309
I wanted it for my collection.

570
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,468
I told you, Blanche isn't here.
She won't be back for two hours.

571
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,948
I know. I'm gonna wait for her.

572
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:17,189
It is a shame. It's so romantic.

573
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,149
Well, I'll never get any work done
if I stay here and think about that.

574
00:56:22,229 --> 00:56:24,268
I'll run with Jane to the store.

575
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:29,108
What a shame. Two tickets to Hawaii.

576
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,949
Oh, I've gotta get her a husband.
Maybe Blanche can help out.

577
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:42,589
We'll be right back
after this commercial announcement.

578
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:44,549
You know, if you're looking
for a new or used car, see me first.

579
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,749
Give me first crack at the deal.
I'll beat anybody else's deal.

580
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,149
I'd gargle anti-freeze
to beat anybody else's deal.

581
00:56:49,229 --> 00:56:50,589
So see me first, give me first shot.

582
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,628
Now here's a nice car.
Seventy-three, this is a Landau,

583
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,349
top power steering, power brakes,
air conditioning. $999.

584
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:01,149
If you're looking for trucks, we got trucks.
We got all kinds of trucks. '79 pickup, $2,999.

585
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:05,268
Here's another one. This is a Long Bed.
This is $3,999. Can't beat that.

586
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:06,749
Give me first shot...

587
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,669
You're traveling
through another dimension.

588
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:26,388
My name is Skeezy. S-K-E-E-Z-Y, sir.

589
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:29,389
S-K-E-... No I-E. Thank you.

590
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,069
Say this.

591
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,349
Hey, grow up.

592
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:22,508
Just say this one word.

593
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,429
Is this another one of your movie proofs?

594
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:27,988
Maybe.

595
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,469
Kid, I don't want to say it.

596
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:33,429
Say what?

597
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,229
You can't. You can't possibly say it

598
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:40,908
because this movie is PG-13. Admit it.

599
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,388
Officer Slater,

600
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,349
the guy with the missing eye,
I saw his license plate.

601
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:47,109
Well, good for you.

602
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:52,989
- You mean the guy with the glass eye?
- No.

603
00:58:53,069 --> 00:58:56,429
When he was running for the car,
it was missing.

604
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,309
It's got words.

605
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:04,029
"Vengeance is..."

606
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,029
Don't touch!

607
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,108
You flipped up on all of it!

608
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,389
God damn it, that's all I can take from you!

609
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:16,069
I got the California Raisin Counsel doing

610
00:59:16,149 --> 00:59:17,549
an all-male version
of The Diary of Anne Frank,

611
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:19,069
doing an all-male version
in my fuzzy slipper!

612
00:59:19,149 --> 00:59:20,668
Tiny Tim is tiptoeing through the tulips!

613
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,708
- Did you catch that?
- You ball-peen jack-a-menace.

614
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,629
I slurped about all the cock-sucking toast
I can take from you!

615
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:27,228
You know you...

616
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,269
I think some of it's English.

617
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,869
Well, see if this is clear enough!

618
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,268
Give me your badge!

619
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,589
And this time, you won't get it back.

620
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:50,509
Wohlschlager, you're partnered up
with the black-and-white digitalization

621
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,949
of Humphrey Bogart.

622
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,509
What, are you making some changes?

623
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:10,188
Come on, why don't you come
and work the funeral with me, anyway?

624
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,909
I mean, I don't know, I wouldn't miss
this one. I hear Torelli spent a bundle.

625
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,469
He's got a damn helicopter
circling the building.

626
01:00:17,549 --> 01:00:21,148
A rooftop funeral service in Long Beach.
How's that for taste?

627
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,469
Who died?

628
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:24,789
Leo the Fart was shot yesterday.

629
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:27,949
Somebody was trying for Torelli and missed.

630
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,068
Leo was tough.

631
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,829
He could do everything
but sneak up on you.

632
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:37,109
Look, look, if you change your mind,
I'll be in front of the hotel.

633
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:58,749
- Where are we, anyway?
- Home.

634
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,428
Geez!
How did you know there was a guy in there?

635
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,628
There's always a guy in there.

636
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,988
Costs me a fortune in closet doors.

637
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:23,869
Right. Like in Slater, Part II:
The Sagittarius Strangler.

638
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:27,508
Yeah, in a few seconds,
you're gonna meet the Madigan strangler.

639
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,028
I just got fired.

640
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,109
What you find so entertaining
happens to be my life.

641
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,348
Now I'm not even a cop any more.

642
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:36,828
You'll get your badge back.

643
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,788
He was just pulling rank because you
destroyed more of the city than usual.

644
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:43,869
Jack, you're not just my hero,
you're everybody's hero.

645
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:47,148
And it will all be okay again. Trust me.

646
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,229
No, Danny. It's getting harder.

647
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,749
I never started out
to be anything but a decent cop,

648
01:01:54,829 --> 01:01:57,948
but I kept getting involved
in these crazy adventures.

649
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:03,028
But the craziest part is, I kept surviving.

650
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,188
Jack, these are the sequels.
They gotta get harder.

651
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,708
But look on the good side.

652
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,109
I mean, you've got a great daughter.

653
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:14,988
And your ex-wife wouldn't keep calling if

654
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,789
somewhere deep down
she didn't want you back.

655
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:19,188
Danny, do you think I would marry
someone so stupid

656
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:22,108
that doesn't know
the real voice from a taped one?

657
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:25,149
I pay a cashier at the drugstore
to call me every so often at the station

658
01:02:25,229 --> 01:02:27,789
so the guys think I have a private life.

659
01:02:29,229 --> 01:02:31,668
My ex-wife, she's happily remarried.

660
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:33,549
She never calls.

661
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:35,909
And Whitney.

662
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:39,549
Why can she not be like
every other teenager?

663
01:02:39,629 --> 01:02:43,029
On prom night, she stays home
and field strips an AK-47.

664
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:47,149
She's going to die a young maid. I know it.

665
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:51,028
I'm going to buy it soon, too.

666
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:54,028
No way.
You can't die till the grosses go down.

667
01:02:56,949 --> 01:02:58,548
That guy Vivaldi,

668
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,949
I heard him say something
was going to happen at a funeral.

669
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,229
Now this Leo the Fart is going to have one.
Maybe we should look into that.

670
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,189
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

671
01:03:06,269 --> 01:03:09,989
Jack, it's a funeral for a guy named Fart.
Hello?

672
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,988
Funeral?

673
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:15,708
Check this out.
Someone tried to kill old man Torelli, right?

674
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,308
Missed and shot Leo the Fart by mistake.

675
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:19,869
- Right.
- Wrong.

676
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:23,469
Who took the shot? Was it Benedict?
Most likely.

677
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:27,788
Would he miss? No way.
Unless he wanted to miss.

678
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,348
You're saying he meant to miss?
Why?

679
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:35,149
Because, amigo,
Leo the Fart was very, very fat.

680
01:03:35,909 --> 01:03:37,908
- Get it?
- No, I don't.

681
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,948
They broke in last night.
They cut Leo open like a turkey,

682
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:44,228
stuffed him with TNT,
he goes off at the funeral

683
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,229
and takes out the entire Torelli mob,
all at once.

684
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:50,668
Vivaldi owns the town.
That's what all this has been about.

685
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,028
Vivaldi's going to blow up that funeral.

686
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,589
No. No. It wouldn't just be a bomb.

687
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,589
I mean, we've already had
a dozen explosions in this movie.

688
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,909
Danny, don't start that again.

689
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:04,349
- Nerve gas!
- What are you talking about?

690
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:08,549
Three canisters of nerve gas were stolen
from military trucks the night before last.

691
01:04:08,629 --> 01:04:12,429
They could have stuffed those inside him.
And you know what that means, don't you?

692
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:17,069
Leo the Fart is going to pass gas
one more time.

693
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,588
Mr. Torelli,
I hope it's all right with you I am here.

694
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,909
- I don't want to be no fourth wheel.
- Nonsense, Antonio...

695
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:40,748
Fifth wheel.

696
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:42,989
That's nice. Thank you, thank you.

697
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:45,148
Did you hear that, Benedict?

698
01:04:45,269 --> 01:04:46,469
Family.

699
01:04:47,069 --> 01:04:49,069
Go pay your respects, huh?

700
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:25,349
- Stay in the car.
- No way. I'm coming with you.

701
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:27,668
Kid, let's say this is a movie.

702
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,828
How many times have you heard someone
say, "Stay in the car" and the guy doesn't?

703
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,389
What happens?

704
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:35,028
- He saves the day.
- Or gets killed.

705
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,388
Good point. I'll stay in the car.

706
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,549
Wait a minute! What if staying in the car
is what gets me killed?

707
01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:44,628
There's a gun in the glove compartment.

708
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,149
- Practice!
- Makes perfect.

709
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:57,108
- You decided to join me, huh?
- The Fart is a bomb.

710
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,429
They're going to take out the whole
Torelli mob. We've got to stop it.

711
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,269
That explains the break-in at the mortuary.
Geez, that's brilliant.

712
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:05,269
Come on.
We'll use the service entrance in back.

713
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:13,229
- Who are you working for, John?
- What do you mean?

714
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,549
We both know
there's no side entrance to this hotel.

715
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:24,069
Sorry, Jack.
I didn't want it to go down this way.

716
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:29,869
Danny told me not to trust you.

717
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:32,349
He said you killed Moe Zart.

718
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:35,229
- Moe, who?
- Zart.

719
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:39,829
I kill a lot of people.
I can't remember half of them.

720
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:42,189
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

721
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:46,388
In a body bag, if you don't drop that.

722
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,309
That's doubtful, kid.

723
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,469
Real doubtful.

724
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:58,188
Thanks for the fingerprints, kid.

725
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,589
You're about to murder Jack Slater.

726
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,309
Here. Chain yourself to that pipe.

727
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:08,669
See, Jack, these drug guys, they got
more money than the U.S. Government.

728
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:12,069
So you cut a deal
with a Sicilian scumbag like Vivaldi.

729
01:07:12,309 --> 01:07:13,829
Right you are.

730
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,908
You see, Vivaldi made up with Torelli,
but it was a phony.

731
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,629
He's going to destroy him.

732
01:07:19,709 --> 01:07:23,989
So, in exchange for letting him alone,
he gives me a profit percentage.

733
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,268
I'll be rich, Jack.

734
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,829
- You'll be dead, but...
- Freeze!

735
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,309
Toss me the cuffs.

736
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:35,868
Man, are you an idiot!
You made the classic movie mistake.

737
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:39,868
Don't explain so much.
You had to get in those last few words.

738
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:43,109
I mean, if you had just fired,
you would have won.

739
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,188
But, no, you're the typical villain. Dumb.

740
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:49,868
You ain't no genius yourself, kid.

741
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:54,189
- The Fart goes off in seven minutes.
- Get my car.

742
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:57,828
Move it.

743
01:08:00,429 --> 01:08:04,268
Well, I'd love to stay and watch the fun,

744
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:08,908
but I have to go and establish my alibi.

745
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:15,989
So, is this the day
you were talking about saving?

746
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:19,628
- I don't see you doing anything.
- I wouldn't want to steal your thunder.

747
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,909
No, no, no.

748
01:08:21,989 --> 01:08:25,508
You stay here and make sure
everything goes on as planned.

749
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:31,148
You had Slater in front of the eight ball
before, but you always screwed it up.

750
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:34,028
All right. Let's go.

751
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:39,709
It's behind the eight ball, you moron.

752
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:44,468
Somebody once told me I talk too much.
No more words.

753
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:50,949
Whiskers! Where the hell have you been?

754
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:53,189
Sorry, Jack. Fur ball problem.

755
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:58,428
Seal off the area. There's a possible
chemical explosion in five minutes.

756
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:03,149
- Thanks, Whiskers. I owe you one.
- Forget it. You saved my fur plenty of times.

757
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,629
You see the hook of that crane?

758
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:11,949
I want it on top of the roof
in two minutes. Go.

759
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,549
Wait. How do I get them to do that?

760
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:42,708
You got to help me move that crane!
You got to help me!

761
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,468
- I got to get that crane to the roof.
- Shit.

762
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,429
Hey, wait a minute!
You got to work this thing!

763
01:09:57,829 --> 01:10:00,028
I don't even know how to drive.

764
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,868
- Pardon me. Excuse me.
- Hey!

765
01:10:39,629 --> 01:10:40,908
Pardon me.

766
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:46,869
He was a good man. A flatulent man.

767
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:52,709
Do you hear this?

768
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:55,589
Help me. Get me out of here.

769
01:10:56,229 --> 01:10:58,949
My God! This man's not dead!

770
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:11,149
Get out of the way! This man needs a doctor!
Out of my way.

771
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,869
- This man needs a doctor!
- I'm a doctor.

772
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:16,029
- You're a doctor?
- Yes.

773
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,068
Check his chin.

774
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:22,548
The doctor has fainted.
Can somebody help this man here?

775
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,068
I'll take the corpse... I mean, the patient.

776
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,189
Look, an elephant.

777
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,789
Hold it! Don't shoot! He'll drop Leo!

778
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:00,948
Don't shoot!

779
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:08,909
Oh, shit!

780
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,308
Watch out!

781
01:13:54,509 --> 01:13:58,949
It's a no-fly zone, fella.
Shit!

782
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:47,109
Danny! He's ticking!
Move the crane as fast as you can!

783
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:12,988
Danny! Stop the crane now! Stop it!

784
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:17,628
Drop! Go! Go! Go! Go! Damn you! Go!

785
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:21,029
Gas bag, drop! Damn you! Drop!

786
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:25,068
Drop! Gas bag, drop!

787
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:48,029
Get out of here! Everybody out!

788
01:16:26,509 --> 01:16:28,148
Silent, but deadly.

789
01:16:32,269 --> 01:16:33,989
Bring the car around.

790
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,628
Can't. The helicopter landed on it.

791
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,908
I hate when that happens.

792
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:42,909
You know, tar actually
sticks to some people.

793
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:57,109
Hey, Dad! I heard you were here.
I thought you could use some clothes.

794
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:59,629
- Thanks, honey.
- Wait a minute.

795
01:17:00,389 --> 01:17:02,548
No one finds this a little convenient?

796
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:05,909
Hey, kid, you always said
this is a movie, didn't you?

797
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:11,949
How did it go?

798
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:16,909
Hey! How did it go?

799
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:24,669
Come on. I'm dying out here.
How was it? I want to know how it went.

800
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:35,068
Come on, move your butt.
How did it went?

801
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,469
Splendid.

802
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:38,188
What?

803
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:43,428
- It went splendidly!
- Wait, wait a minute. I can't hear you.

804
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:46,988
I don't want to miss a thing.
Come here. Come here.

805
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:50,589
- Hey, Benedict, get your stuff.
- Yes.

806
01:17:50,669 --> 01:17:53,789
- Was it beautiful?
- Perfect in every detail.

807
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:57,309
And the gas tanks. Poof! Were they okay?

808
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,188
Like clockwork.

809
01:17:59,749 --> 01:18:01,149
You should have been there.

810
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:05,748
Men, women and children dropping
left and right, writhing and screaming.

811
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:09,109
Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
I want to enjoy it all.

812
01:18:09,509 --> 01:18:11,029
Go on, go on. Tell me, tell me.

813
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:15,709
They were writhing and screaming and
leaping to their doom to escape the pain.

814
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:19,149
- Really? Really?
- No, not really. I'm lying.

815
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:21,069
It was a complete and utter balls-up

816
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:24,308
and I've had a terrible day,
thanks largely to you.

817
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:29,748
What is this, Benedict?
First, you're my friend. Now you turn a

818
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,869
- 360 on me.
- God.

819
01:18:32,949 --> 01:18:36,628
One-eighty,
you stupid, spaghetti-slurping cretin.

820
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:39,309
One-eighty! If I did a 360,

821
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:42,828
I'd go completely around
and end up back where I started!

822
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,549
- What?
- Trust me.

823
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:53,469
If that little turd, Daniel Madigan,
can move through parallel worlds,

824
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,829
I can move through
parallel worlds, in and out.

825
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:01,629
In, steal whatever I want, and out again.
Impossible to catch.

826
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:06,069
If God was a villain,

827
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,388
he'd be me.

828
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:14,029
- You want me vacuum now?
- No, thank you.

829
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,949
But the pool could benefit
from some attention.

830
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,428
Very good.

831
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:35,149
Don't move.

832
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:41,989
- All right, Slater, I'll go quietly.
- The hell you will.

833
01:19:49,749 --> 01:19:53,189
That was for blowing up
my second cousin, Frank's house.

834
01:19:53,269 --> 01:19:57,108
And this is for blowing up
my ex-wife's house.

835
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,829
But this...
This is for my daughter's black eye!

836
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:09,868
Usually, when I do that, it leaves a hole.

837
01:20:11,149 --> 01:20:15,149
The ticket. Jack, he's got the ticket!

838
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,029
It's the key to everything. It's magic.

839
01:20:20,029 --> 01:20:24,109
See? That's my world!
He's gone over to my world!

840
01:20:24,829 --> 01:20:27,549
The door, it must still be open. Come on!

841
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:31,229
I'm not worried that you're crazy any more.

842
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:34,308
I'm worried that you're right.

843
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,268
But if I go, how do I get back?

844
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:41,268
You can't go through life
nitpicking every little thing.

845
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:42,788
Now, come on!

846
01:20:47,869 --> 01:20:49,429
The hell with it.

847
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,669
There was nothing to it.

848
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:03,788
- We're still here.
- Are you sure about that? Look.

849
01:21:08,189 --> 01:21:09,789
Quickly! Quickly!

850
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:14,789
- I want to see if Nick's okay.
- There's no time. Come on.

851
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:20,749
What the hell? We're in New York.

852
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:23,069
Jack, it all makes sense.

853
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:26,668
No, actually it makes absolutely no sense,
but I'll try to explain it you. Later.

854
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:30,189
Meantime, please be careful.
Things work different here.

855
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,749
- Get out!
- All right. Don't get feisty.

856
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:40,629
- The car's a piece of junk, anyway.
- Drive, bonehead!

857
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:46,629
Here's another explosion for your movie, kid.

858
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:54,349
Not a word. Not one word.

859
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,628
- My hand. It really hurts.
- Things work different here.

860
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:11,589
You can't smash a car window with your
bare hand and not have it hurt.

861
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:15,269
Thanks for sharing.
You couldn't have told me this earlier?

862
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:23,109
- I think the taxis are bulletproof.
- Jack, We got to get that ticket back.

863
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:46,029
No way, Slater. Please. Listen to me.
It won't work, you hear me?

864
01:22:46,349 --> 01:22:49,029
You can't play chicken in real life.
You'll crash!

865
01:22:49,109 --> 01:22:50,949
Out of the car, amigo.

866
01:22:51,469 --> 01:22:54,909
This isn't the movies any more, Jack.
Here, you have to reload guns...

867
01:22:54,989 --> 01:22:58,269
- Go, Danny! Get out!
- Car crashes can kill you! You hear me?

868
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:03,429
You are going to die! Jack!

869
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:06,189
What did I do?

870
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:15,069
Oh, Christ, please.

871
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:27,429
Damn it, that hurt.

872
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:30,589
You're lucky you're still alive,
you dumb idiot!

873
01:23:30,669 --> 01:23:35,748
Hey, '89 Mercury Sable,
standard driver's-side air bag.

874
01:23:35,989 --> 01:23:38,468
Checker Cab, no air bag. Who is dumb?

875
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:40,828
Okay, okay. Just make sure they're dead.

876
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:43,148
- Give me a break. They're dead.
- Just check, will you?

877
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:46,868
- Look. Dead.
- They always look dead! Like in Die Hard.

878
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:51,469
The guy's hanging there by his neck
and at the end of the movie he comes back.

879
01:23:53,549 --> 01:23:55,829
All right. Make sure to cover me.

880
01:23:56,029 --> 01:23:58,508
I think he's got a windshield wiper.

881
01:24:04,389 --> 01:24:06,308
Maybe he used the ticket.

882
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:11,429
Maybe it's on all the time now.

883
01:24:25,389 --> 01:24:27,109
What is this place?

884
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:30,188
Where am I now?

885
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,389
Danny, you got a place I can sit down?

886
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,509
Yeah. Come on.

887
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:44,829
Nick! Nick!

888
01:24:45,269 --> 01:24:49,268
Danny. Oh, my God.
I was so worried. Are you okay?

889
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:51,468
Did you see what happened?

890
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:53,949
No, I slept the sleep of the dead, kid,
in here until

891
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:56,989
I woke up at 2:00 in the morning
and I figured you'd gone home.

892
01:24:57,069 --> 01:24:59,709
I wasn't home, Nick. I was in the movie.

893
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:04,669
I'm getting a little up in years, kid.
Define "in".

894
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,989
Whitney kissed me on the mouth.

895
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:10,788
I drove one of those great big cranes and
dropped Leo the Fart in the La Brea Tar Pits.

896
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:13,788
I was with Jack Slater every step of the way!

897
01:25:17,389 --> 01:25:19,268
Oh, my God.

898
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,469
The ticket works?

899
01:25:24,909 --> 01:25:28,868
I could have used it all this time
and I never used it 'cause I...

900
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,149
I was too frightened.

901
01:25:32,749 --> 01:25:35,669
But it's not too late. I can still go visit

902
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:38,589
Garbo in Camille.

903
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,988
Jean Harlow. Oh, boy, I had a crush...

904
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:46,028
Monroe in Bus Stop.

905
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:53,828
Forgive me for going on like that, sir.
I'm a great admirer of your work, too.

906
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:56,389
Nick, it isn't who you think.

907
01:25:57,669 --> 01:25:59,748
You mean, it's... Is he...

908
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:03,789
This is a wonderful moment
for me, Mr. Slater.

909
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,949
I've never met a fictional character before.

910
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:11,469
How new and exciting
this must all be for you.

911
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,589
Hey, I just found out I was imaginary.

912
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:19,269
I mean, how would you feel if you found out
that somebody made you up?

913
01:26:19,349 --> 01:26:22,788
Your job, your marriage, your kids.

914
01:26:24,549 --> 01:26:27,468
Oh, yeah.
Let's push his son off the building.

915
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:29,949
Gives you nightmares the rest of your life.

916
01:26:30,029 --> 01:26:33,188
But you're fictional, so who cares? I'm sorry,

917
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,589
but I don't find it so new and exciting
to discover

918
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:37,868
that my whole life has been a damn movie.

919
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:40,509
Well, you're young and impressionable.

920
01:26:41,549 --> 01:26:44,229
You know,
there's lots worse things than movies.

921
01:26:44,309 --> 01:26:49,869
There's politicians and wars and forest fires,
and famine and plague...

922
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:55,668
- Sickness, pain, warts, politicians...
- You already mentioned them.

923
01:26:55,949 --> 01:26:59,148
I know I did.
They're twice as bad as anything else.

924
01:27:00,069 --> 01:27:03,228
Most of my life's been movies, too.
Well, showing them.

925
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,548
But that's all over for me now.

926
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:10,388
The theater's shut. I'm gonna clear out
my stuff, and then it's the wrecking ball.

927
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:14,549
But now, I got another chance.
Could I have the ticket back, please?

928
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:18,429
Well... We've got this one little

929
01:27:20,549 --> 01:27:22,988
- hiccup.
- What do you mean "hiccup"?

930
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:27,029
Benedict's here, too, and he's got the ticket.

931
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,389
That madman with the glass eye?

932
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:36,669
- How the hell are you going to get back?
- That's a good question.

933
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,629
But we wouldn't want to nitpick.
Right, Danny?

934
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:46,308
Now, you just follow my lead.

935
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:54,828
Where have you been?
Have you got any idea what time it is?

936
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,228
The police called.
You're not there, you're not here.

937
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,069
Mom, I'm sorry. Okay?

938
01:28:01,389 --> 01:28:02,389
"Okay?"

939
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,589
There are nine million kids
out there with guns

940
01:28:05,669 --> 01:28:08,749
and that's all
you have to say to me, "Okay?"

941
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:12,029
- Will you get in here?
- Well... Mom, wait.

942
01:28:12,909 --> 01:28:16,429
You know how you always say
you wished I had more friends?

943
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:17,868
Well...

944
01:28:25,549 --> 01:28:27,308
Hello, Mrs. Madigan.

945
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:29,989
Arnold Braunschweiger.

946
01:28:48,869 --> 01:28:51,188
Sweetheart, want to have a party?

947
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,868
- How old are you?
- Forget it.

948
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:13,548
No, you get the shoes! Take the shoes!
Come on, we ain't got time. Come on!

949
01:29:17,509 --> 01:29:18,988
Take his shoes?

950
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:44,149
No screams?

951
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:49,028
No sirens?

952
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:55,628
Excuse me!

953
01:29:57,549 --> 01:29:59,628
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?

954
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:06,149
I'm sorry to bother you.
I wonder if you'd help me test a theory.

955
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,268
Sure. What can I do for you?

956
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,469
Well...

957
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,709
Hello?

958
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:34,548
I've just shot somebody. I did it on purpose!

959
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:44,708
I said, I have murdered a man,
and I want to confess!

960
01:30:45,549 --> 01:30:47,468
Hey, shut up down there!

961
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:56,829
I don't know what to say.
I feel a little shy and embarrassed right now,

962
01:30:56,909 --> 01:31:00,669
but, I mean, I understand that,
for some reason, we look alike.

963
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:02,548
It's crazy...

964
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:07,149
The thing is, you really do look uncannily
like him except for one thing, the eyes.

965
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:10,788
- You are obviously much more intelligent.
- Thank you.

966
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:13,469
Good morning. Good afternoon.
Good to see you.

967
01:31:13,549 --> 01:31:15,109
What kind of eggs do you want?

968
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:18,789
Scrambled.
Have you guys been up all night?

969
01:31:18,869 --> 01:31:20,869
Why didn't you tell me that Jack was a cop

970
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:22,588
and why didn't you tell me
you spent the whole night

971
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:24,468
in a police station looking at mug shots?

972
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,708
You could have taken two minutes
to call your mother.

973
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,949
Why didn't you tell me you had no friends?

974
01:31:29,029 --> 01:31:31,429
And what is this business
about going to the movies at midnight

975
01:31:31,509 --> 01:31:34,228
when you knew
your mother would be worried?

976
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:42,629
Mom. You turned him into a wimp.

977
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,309
Oh, I think not. Toast?

978
01:31:45,629 --> 01:31:46,988
No, thanks.

979
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:50,548
Jack, are you okay?

980
01:31:52,749 --> 01:31:54,029
We talked.

981
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:57,869
I mean, I never just talked
to a woman before. It's neat.

982
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:59,709
Neat?

983
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:05,108
Wimp. Next, they'll be talking about sex.

984
01:32:06,469 --> 01:32:09,789
Me and Jack are going out today!
I'm helping him on a case!

985
01:32:09,869 --> 01:32:10,789
Oh, no.

986
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:14,109
Your license to kill
expired at 4:00 this morning, young man.

987
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,269
Get in here and eat some eggs.

988
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:21,268
Mom, I have to help. I'm the only witness.

989
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:23,868
You know, like the kid in the movie
with Harrison Ford?

990
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:25,829
There is no comparison.

991
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:27,828
We're not Jewish.

992
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:29,949
- Amish.
- Whatever-ish!

993
01:32:30,029 --> 01:32:35,548
Irene. Don't worry. It won't be that hard.
There are eight million in this city.

994
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:37,468
And I'm very good at catching people.

995
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:41,868
Yeah! And the future of
the world may be at stake, and, and maybe...

996
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,788
Could you turn this up, please?

997
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,869
What's that?

998
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:55,948
- Mozart.
- The guy Practice killed?

999
01:32:58,429 --> 01:33:00,149
That's right, Jack.

1000
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:02,828
You like classical music?

1001
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:09,629
I don't know. I think I will. Wow.

1002
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:21,549
You tell my mom who you really were?

1003
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:23,069
Yeah, a cop from LA.

1004
01:33:23,149 --> 01:33:24,468
I mean, really.

1005
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:27,589
Well, real enough. For right now.

1006
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:32,269
So you think for sure
you're going to catch him?

1007
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,348
I always catch everybody.

1008
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:36,669
And you're going to spot him from up here?

1009
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:40,909
Hey, give me a break.
It's the first time I've been to any place real.

1010
01:33:43,149 --> 01:33:45,228
Now, this ticket of yours...

1011
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:47,909
It worked in one movie.

1012
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:50,828
Does that mean
that Benedict could use it again?

1013
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:53,868
You mean on other movies?
Why would he want to do that?

1014
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,189
I don't know.

1015
01:33:58,949 --> 01:34:00,268
But it's a start.

1016
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:03,269
The possibilities are limitless.

1017
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:06,229
But I realized after the car crash

1018
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:08,829
that the ultimate freedom
would always elude me

1019
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:12,989
until Jack Slater was,
and forgive the pun, taken out of the picture.

1020
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:18,469
And I thought perhaps
you might like to be inclined to help.

1021
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:24,869
Look, I understand that
all this must be strange and difficult for you,

1022
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:29,068
but if you do this right,
the world is your oyster. Trust me.

1023
01:34:31,149 --> 01:34:34,469
You can have complete freedom
to do whatever you want.

1024
01:34:35,389 --> 01:34:37,629
Beyond even your wildest dreams.

1025
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:42,869
And you'll never have to
go back to this film again.

1026
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:50,628
Now I know you've never heard of this man,
but his actual name, believe it or not,

1027
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,629
is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1028
01:34:54,349 --> 01:34:56,908
Jack, there's got to be a thousand theaters
in this city

1029
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,669
and we've been looking for five hours.

1030
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:00,908
We are that close in catching him.

1031
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:02,909
No, Jack.
We're that close to catching pneumonia.

1032
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:05,949
- Look, in my world, they just leave clues.
- But we're not in your world!

1033
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:07,989
Or they just show up and then kidnap me.

1034
01:35:08,069 --> 01:35:12,028
That kind of stuff doesn't happen here, Jack,
because this world stinks!

1035
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:15,069
Hey.
The world is what you make of it, Danny.

1036
01:35:15,149 --> 01:35:18,429
Now if you want to give up
and go home, then go ahead.

1037
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:22,548
You believed in me in the movies.
Why not now?

1038
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:24,669
Because here, you're just...

1039
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:27,908
Just what?

1040
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:50,189
Jack... Jack, there he is!

1041
01:36:04,949 --> 01:36:06,028
Jack!

1042
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,708
Are you nuts?

1043
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:17,749
- Damn it!
- Hey, you crazy asshole!

1044
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:19,109
Jack, he's just a cabbie!

1045
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:20,509
You've seen those movies where they say,

1046
01:36:20,589 --> 01:36:22,469
"Make my day"
or "I am your worst nightmare".

1047
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:25,589
Well, listen to this one,
rubber baby buggy bumpers.

1048
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:28,268
Ha! You didn't know I'm gonna say that,
did you?

1049
01:36:29,629 --> 01:36:30,909
- Where did he go? Talk!
- How would I know?

1050
01:36:30,989 --> 01:36:33,669
The guy was in the back reading the paper.

1051
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:39,549
You were right, Jack.
He has been going to the movies.

1052
01:36:39,629 --> 01:36:41,949
Kid, that ain't the half of it.

1053
01:36:43,909 --> 01:36:47,149
Hi, I'm Army Archerd,
and we are live to you from New York.

1054
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:49,349
We're just moments away
from the world premiere of

1055
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:52,509
Arnold Schwarzenegger's Jack Slater IV.

1056
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:55,909
And here's the man they've come to see,
folks. There's no mistaking that car.

1057
01:36:55,989 --> 01:37:00,869
Here they are, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and his lovely wife, Maria Shriver.

1058
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:05,669
- So good to see you all.
- Are you a big-time fan of Jack Slater films?

1059
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:10,108
I've enjoyed...
It was just beautiful... I just loved it.

1060
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:12,189
The National Enquirer. Don't talk to them.
Okay?

1061
01:37:12,269 --> 01:37:15,109
Hi, how are you?
Look, Time magazine. That's great. Hi.

1062
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:17,388
Hi. How are you? Hello.

1063
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:19,828
Now remember, don't plug the restaurants.

1064
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:23,229
I just hate it when you plug
the restaurants or the gyms. It's so tacky.

1065
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:24,748
So why was he going to the movies?

1066
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:25,949
Maybe to get help.

1067
01:37:26,029 --> 01:37:29,629
Benedict can do damn near anything
with the ticket, but we still know who he is.

1068
01:37:29,709 --> 01:37:32,269
- So he's got to take us out.
- He can't get to you.

1069
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:36,349
Suppose he doesn't have to get to me.
Suppose all he has to do is get to him.

1070
01:37:36,429 --> 01:37:38,789
Benedict is going to kill Schwarzenegger.

1071
01:37:38,869 --> 01:37:42,748
- Who's Schwarzenegger, who's Slater.
- Bingo.

1072
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,028
We kill less people in this movie.

1073
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,269
This movie we only killed 48 people

1074
01:37:48,349 --> 01:37:50,828
compared to the last one,
where we killed 119.

1075
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:52,868
And I want to make sure that the action fans
understand

1076
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,748
we make up for it with a good story,
lot of emotions, depth, dimensions...

1077
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,028
There are thousands in attendance
here tonight.

1078
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,948
And millions more are
listening to us live around the world.

1079
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:04,589
I'm going to direct it,
produce it, and star in it.

1080
01:38:04,669 --> 01:38:06,748
- Is this guy a success story, or what?
- It’s unbelievable.

1081
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:08,029
Only in America.

1082
01:38:08,109 --> 01:38:09,588
Well, only in Hollywood, I would say.

1083
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,108
And talking about Hollywood,

1084
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:14,428
at Planet Hollywood, we have this incredible
memorabilia. Yes, I'm telling you...

1085
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:16,229
Excuse us, we're just gonna get going.
Thanks very much.

1086
01:38:16,309 --> 01:38:17,749
...Absolutely fabulous. I'm telling you.

1087
01:38:17,829 --> 01:38:20,028
You embarrassed me, you low-forehead.
It was humiliating.

1088
01:38:20,110 --> 01:38:21,708
How could you do something like that?

1089
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:26,109
Chris, check this out. Look, it's the Ripper
from Jack Slater III.

1090
01:38:26,189 --> 01:38:27,588
Scary.

1091
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:30,909
Let's "ax" him a question, okay?
See if we can get him over here.

1092
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:32,268
Wow, will you look at this?
A method villain.

1093
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:34,949
Rip, Rip, come here.
What brings you here tonight?

1094
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:39,589
I... I thought I might kill someone.

1095
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:42,268
Maybe you should start with
your designer.

1096
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:45,349
Nobody wants to miss out tonight.
The limos just keep coming.

1097
01:38:45,429 --> 01:38:48,028
The stars are really shining in Times Square.

1098
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:51,109
Excuse me, sir.
Could I see your invitation?

1099
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:55,629
Pete, it's okay.
He's with me. I'm his agent.

1100
01:38:55,709 --> 01:38:57,669
Jesus Christ, Tom, come here.

1101
01:38:57,749 --> 01:39:00,149
My goodness, it's Tom Noonan, of course,

1102
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:03,549
the actor who played the Ripper.
Who plays the Rip...

1103
01:39:03,629 --> 01:39:04,588
What?

1104
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:06,909
What are you, nuts? You want to play
ax killers the rest of your life?

1105
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:08,028
Honey, honey, come here.

1106
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,869
I'm gonna need the manager's office
for about five, 10 minutes.

1107
01:39:09,949 --> 01:39:11,509
- I'm sorry, sir...
- You're sorry? Here's 50 bucks.

1108
01:39:11,589 --> 01:39:12,548
How sorry are you now?

1109
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:14,549
What do you think
Jack Slater says about America?

1110
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:15,909
I really want to hear it.

1111
01:39:15,989 --> 01:39:16,948
I don't really want to hear it.

1112
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:20,589
I'm not really a big fan of Arnold's
but she is, you know.

1113
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:25,549
Arnold really turns her on and I just want to
be there when it happens, that's all.

1114
01:39:25,869 --> 01:39:28,468
Good, Tom, you got the props, too.
That's terrific.

1115
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:30,668
Why don't you just whip a hibachi
out from under your coat there?

1116
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:32,829
And we could make some shish kebabs
for the critics. That'd be good.

1117
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,628
You're lucky I have a friend
who rents tuxedos.

1118
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:39,269
Hello. Yeah. I know it's late. Tell him it's me.

1119
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:42,748
Did Nicholson show up to the premiere
of Batman dressed as the Joker?

1120
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:44,508
I don't think so.

1121
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:47,548
Hi, Murray,
get me your brother-in-law, will you?

1122
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,028
Yes, it's important.

1123
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:52,389
It fits nice. Moving the button was
a good idea. Just get...

1124
01:39:52,469 --> 01:39:54,429
Hey, Marv. Yeah, I need a tux.

1125
01:39:58,509 --> 01:40:00,869
- What the hell was that?
- Hey! Watch it!

1126
01:40:00,949 --> 01:40:03,828
You're a big action guy.
What do you think about this?

1127
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:06,188
I would never miss
the premiere for a second.

1128
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:10,548
Where am I sitting? Where?
Where am I sitting?

1129
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:12,589
There's two balconies.

1130
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:16,109
I believe you're in the upper...
Lower balcony.

1131
01:40:16,189 --> 01:40:17,629
- You stay here...
- Yeah, I know. I stay here.

1132
01:40:17,709 --> 01:40:19,029
And be careful.

1133
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:33,989
Somebody should
be checking that other balcony. Definitely!

1134
01:40:44,309 --> 01:40:47,068
Arnold, look. Deal's done, right?

1135
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:49,989
- What?
- Slater V, the soundtrack.

1136
01:41:31,349 --> 01:41:33,148
I'll be a son of a...

1137
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,628
Jack!

1138
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:38,068
Jack! It's the Ripper!
He's brought back the Ripper!

1139
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:42,348
Jack, Benedict's brought back the Ripper!

1140
01:41:45,869 --> 01:41:48,108
Everybody down! Now!

1141
01:41:53,709 --> 01:41:55,109
Get off me!

1142
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:04,909
Get the hell off me.

1143
01:42:06,589 --> 01:42:09,628
The studio should let me know
when they're planning a stunt.

1144
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:12,908
You know, you are the best
celebrity look-alike I've ever seen.

1145
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:15,549
Why not?

1146
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:28,668
Hey, if you get to Los Angeles,

1147
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:31,349
call my office.
We can get you shopping center openings...

1148
01:42:31,429 --> 01:42:35,429
Look, I don't really like you. All right?
You've brought me nothing but pain.

1149
01:42:35,509 --> 01:42:37,149
Jack, help!

1150
01:42:39,949 --> 01:42:41,749
Did anyone come out of here?

1151
01:42:41,829 --> 01:42:43,949
Did you see anyone come out here?

1152
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:48,069
Did you see a crazy guy with an ax
coming out of here?

1153
01:42:48,149 --> 01:42:49,548
No, no. I didn't.

1154
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:03,829
Hey, Jack. What kept you?

1155
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:09,069
Are you all right, Danny?

1156
01:43:09,709 --> 01:43:11,269
Yes... Yes, sir.

1157
01:43:14,909 --> 01:43:17,829
You know, I tried to change, Jack.

1158
01:43:17,909 --> 01:43:24,468
I really tried to do what he told me to do,
but you know, I kept hearing that old music.

1159
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:28,269
That's how I knew you'd come here, Jack.

1160
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:30,989
Now, lose the piece.

1161
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:36,869
There.

1162
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:41,108
It's now between you and me,
so let the boy go.

1163
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:44,029
Hey, we've played this number before,
haven't we, Jack?

1164
01:43:44,109 --> 01:43:45,748
Let's see, what comes next?

1165
01:43:46,189 --> 01:43:51,149
You throw the gun away, right?
We did that part and...

1166
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:56,069
And then you tell me to let the kid go and...

1167
01:43:57,470 --> 01:44:00,469
I'm getting bored.
Why don't we just skip to the end?

1168
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:15,029
Come on, Jack! Come on.

1169
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:17,308
Over here, right here, Jack. Come on.
Right here.

1170
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:22,189
Come on, Jack! Let's go, man.
Come here, Jack. Come on, Jack.

1171
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:25,829
Let's go, let's go. Come on. Let's do it, Jack.

1172
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:50,269
I'll be back!

1173
01:44:56,269 --> 01:44:57,908
The hell you will.

1174
01:45:01,989 --> 01:45:03,668
Jack!

1175
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:07,149
- Danny?
- Jack, please!

1176
01:45:07,229 --> 01:45:08,509
Danny!

1177
01:45:10,349 --> 01:45:13,869
Danny! I'll be right there.
I'm coming! Hang on!

1178
01:45:18,589 --> 01:45:20,349
Just hang on now.

1179
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:27,108
- Jack, help!
- Hold on, Danny! I'll be right there.

1180
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:30,349
I'm coming.

1181
01:45:31,509 --> 01:45:33,069
Jack, hurry!

1182
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:36,428
Hold on, Danny, and don't look down!

1183
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:40,909
Oh, God, please, don't let him die.

1184
01:45:42,589 --> 01:45:44,108
Now, listen, kid.

1185
01:45:44,909 --> 01:45:47,508
You grab my hand, and we get out of here.

1186
01:45:48,389 --> 01:45:50,828
I can't, Jack. We'll fall.

1187
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:54,388
Come on, now. Danny, trust me.

1188
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:56,748
I can't do it, Jack.

1189
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:58,989
Listen to me, Danny. Listen to me.

1190
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,469
You hold on with your feet, with your legs

1191
01:46:01,549 --> 01:46:06,909
and you let your hands go
and I will catch you. Okay? Believe in me.

1192
01:46:06,989 --> 01:46:10,909
I will catch you. Now, get my hand. Let's go.

1193
01:46:10,989 --> 01:46:14,069
Go for it, now. Come on, Danny. Yes.

1194
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:35,989
This hero stuff has its limits.

1195
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:48,028
I need a hospital.
I think my shoulder is out of the socket.

1196
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:50,348
Will the morgue suffice?

1197
01:46:51,589 --> 01:46:52,909
Get down, Danny.

1198
01:46:58,029 --> 01:47:02,268
Give it up, Benedict.
The whole lobby is swarming with cops.

1199
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:06,309
I think I can manage to avoid them,
but if not,

1200
01:47:06,389 --> 01:47:10,029
I've another
little explosive surprise for them.

1201
01:47:13,389 --> 01:47:16,309
Gentlemen, since
you're about to die anyway,

1202
01:47:16,389 --> 01:47:20,029
I may as well tell you the entire plot.

1203
01:47:20,109 --> 01:47:25,468
Think of villains, Jack.
You want Dracula? Dracula? Hang on.

1204
01:47:25,989 --> 01:47:30,989
I'll fetch him. Dracula. I can get King Kong.

1205
01:47:31,469 --> 01:47:36,509
We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger.
Have a surprise party for Adolf Hitler.

1206
01:47:36,589 --> 01:47:38,829
Hannibal Lecter can do the catering.

1207
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:42,669
And then we'll all
have a christening for Rosemary's baby.

1208
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:48,508
All I have to do
is snap my fingers and they'll be here.

1209
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:52,029
They're lining up to get here,
and do you know why, Jack?

1210
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:53,789
Shall I tell you why?

1211
01:47:53,869 --> 01:47:58,668
Because here in this world,
the bad guys can win.

1212
01:47:59,989 --> 01:48:02,029
I shall miss you, Jack.

1213
01:48:10,029 --> 01:48:16,109
Gee, did you make a movie mistake!
You forgot to reload the damn gun.

1214
01:48:16,189 --> 01:48:19,949
No, Jack. I just left one chamber empty.

1215
01:48:26,229 --> 01:48:27,629
Son of a...

1216
01:48:35,549 --> 01:48:38,189
My arm! You broke my arm!

1217
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:44,069
You see, Jack,

1218
01:48:45,389 --> 01:48:48,069
bad guys can win.

1219
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:04,468
Jack!

1220
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:07,628
Now!

1221
01:49:08,749 --> 01:49:10,949
No sequel for you.

1222
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:19,308
The ticket.

1223
01:50:09,229 --> 01:50:10,669
Take him home.

1224
01:50:11,269 --> 01:50:14,349
Take him back to
where this is just a flesh wound.

1225
01:50:16,589 --> 01:50:20,748
Don't you understand?
We got to get him back to the movies.

1226
01:50:22,509 --> 01:50:24,509
I said turn around.

1227
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:33,068
Great! Just great!
They always run away.

1228
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:34,629
Hang on, Jack.

1229
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:39,429
Danny, do you know how to drive?

1230
01:50:39,509 --> 01:50:41,389
Sure. I watched you, didn't I?

1231
01:51:18,029 --> 01:51:19,948
Get out of the way!

1232
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:33,309
Nick, fire up the projector. Hurry!

1233
01:51:33,389 --> 01:51:34,668
- Slater's dying.
- What happened?

1234
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:38,829
- You got the ticket?
- No, but it's got to work, anyway. It's got to!

1235
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,188
Just hold on, Jack. You'll make it.
This is gonna work.

1236
01:51:57,549 --> 01:51:58,989
It's got to be here, Jack.

1237
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:08,788
Please, please.
Nick, hurry! The door won't open.

1238
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:12,068
No sweat, kid. You tried.

1239
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:16,669
It's got to be here.

1240
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:26,669
Just hold...

1241
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:34,269
Where do you think you're going?
Back off. You can't have him.

1242
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:37,868
I've had it up to here with you, Mister.
Who stays, who goes...

1243
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:41,109
Well, I'm telling you this one stays.

1244
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:48,428
I was only curious.

1245
01:52:49,789 --> 01:52:52,509
He's not on any of my lists.

1246
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:56,429
Though you are, Daniel.

1247
01:52:58,469 --> 01:52:59,749
Now?

1248
01:52:59,829 --> 01:53:00,989
Oh, no.

1249
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,948
You die a grandfather.

1250
01:53:10,949 --> 01:53:14,389
Hey, wait a minute. Help us.

1251
01:53:15,149 --> 01:53:18,588
You got to get him back.
You can do it. I know you can.

1252
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:24,869
I don't do fiction. Not my field. Sorry.

1253
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:30,268
You are a very brave young man.

1254
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:35,308
Unfortunately, you're not very bright.

1255
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:37,589
If I were you...

1256
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:44,149
I might be looking
for the other half of the ticket.

1257
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:56,588
They're all gold. They're all gold.

1258
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:59,748
Yes!

1259
01:54:01,870 --> 01:54:05,348
I've got it, Jack. I'll get you home, you'll see.

1260
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:08,228
You can't die.

1261
01:54:09,229 --> 01:54:13,669
I know. Not until the grosses go down.

1262
01:54:13,749 --> 01:54:16,588
No. This is going to save us.

1263
01:54:18,789 --> 01:54:22,309
Throw that silly thing away.

1264
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:25,869
Holy cow!

1265
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:50,868
Let's hear it for Houdini!

1266
01:54:54,749 --> 01:54:58,669
Slater!

1267
01:54:59,429 --> 01:55:01,629
Damn it. Anybody seen Slater?

1268
01:55:01,709 --> 01:55:05,229
You see Slater,
you tell him to get in my office right now.

1269
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,149
Help, somebody!

1270
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:29,868
They got Jack! Doctor! Hey, doc! Move!

1271
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:35,149
Here, take this. You've got to get back
before it changes its mind.

1272
01:55:35,230 --> 01:55:38,109
No way. I'm not going to leave you.

1273
01:55:38,189 --> 01:55:41,908
I'm just an imaginary hero, Danny.
You have a real life.

1274
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:46,028
You're real to me. Don't you get it?

1275
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:50,909
You're the best thing in... I need you to...

1276
01:55:51,349 --> 01:55:55,228
To be here where you can always find me
but I need you to be out there.

1277
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:56,468
To believe in me.

1278
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:57,828
Doctor, doctor!

1279
01:55:57,910 --> 01:56:02,949
I need you to take care of your mother for me
'cause... Oh, I would love to...

1280
01:56:05,069 --> 01:56:06,629
You have your whole life ahead of you.

1281
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:09,709
And pimples and premature ejaculation.
I heard.

1282
01:56:13,749 --> 01:56:16,269
- What?
- It’s just...

1283
01:56:17,869 --> 01:56:20,708
I'm scared I'm never going to see you again.

1284
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:27,629
Whoever thinks that,
will be making a big mistake.

1285
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:39,108
Get out of the way. Out of the way.
You want a doctor? I'm a doctor.

1286
01:56:39,190 --> 01:56:41,868
Get out of the way.
I'm a doctor. Get out of the way.

1287
01:56:41,989 --> 01:56:45,388
- What happened? What happened, pal?
- What is it, doc?

1288
01:56:52,109 --> 01:56:55,589
What is this, some kind of a joke?
I wouldn't even call this a flesh wound.

1289
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:57,468
Come on, here, let's get him up.

1290
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:17,228
Damn it, where the hell have you been?

1291
01:57:19,429 --> 01:57:21,309
Ha. It's working again.

1292
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:23,709
And you know the cost of that door is
coming right out of your meager

1293
01:57:23,789 --> 01:57:24,869
but undeserved paycheck

1294
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:26,909
on account of
I got the Save-The-Eagle foundation

1295
01:57:26,989 --> 01:57:29,148
doing a fucking tango up and down
my Hershey Highway!

1296
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:30,548
Put a sock in it.

1297
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:32,829
I don't care
who does what to your Hershey Highway,

1298
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:37,149
and stop shouting. I'm not deaf.
You know why you're shouting?

1299
01:57:37,229 --> 01:57:39,868
Because it's in the script.
You're the comic relief.

1300
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:44,149
Yes, and you know what else?
I'm the hero so shut up!

1301
01:57:49,510 --> 01:57:53,189
You see, Hollywood is writing our lives
and you know something?

1302
01:57:53,269 --> 01:57:55,829
I don't want to shoot people
anymore and blow up buildings.

1303
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:56,988
You know why we do this here?

1304
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:59,949
You got to be a magician, after all, Nick.

1305
01:58:00,269 --> 01:58:01,869
It really does work.

1306
01:58:03,029 --> 01:58:06,509
The ticket's yours, Danny,
and you know something?

1307
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:10,188
I think the magic was yours, too.

1308
01:58:11,509 --> 01:58:12,748
Come on.

1309
01:58:13,469 --> 01:58:15,348
Ever tell you about the time
I was about your age

1310
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:18,069
and my pop took me to see Buffalo Bill?

1311
01:58:18,149 --> 01:58:21,469
Yeah, well, we went backstage to see
Sitting Bull who was his medicine man.
