1
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,729
Are we going to get
something published, or what?

2
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,090
Or do you just want
to cultivate your angst?

3
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,893
- There is a reason why we hesitated
- What do you mean?

4
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,535
- You're the one who stopped.

5
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,539
- Sure, but I can start walking again.

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,693
Do I really want to
expose the world to this?

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,412
Let's just do it.

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,500
<i>This is when it all begins.</i>

9
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,929
<i>Their manuscripts</i>
<i>would have been accepted immediately.</i>

10
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,049
<i>They would've been published the next fall.</i>

11
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,729
<i>Finally they would've been authors.</i>

12
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,254
<i>Their books would have sold poorly.</i>
<i>Erik and Phillip couldn't care less.</i>

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:36,377
<i>More importantly, the books' enigmatic</i>
<i>nature would've made them cult classics</i>

14
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,218
<i>Phillip would've been</i>
<i>overwhelmed by his success.</i>

15
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,653
<i>In a burst of hubris he'd declare</i>
<i>his literary project completed and...</i>

16
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,216
<i>No, it would've been love that caused</i>
<i>Phillip to lose faith in literature.</i>

17
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,578
<i>He would have left Oslo</i>
<i>without telling a soul.</i>

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,890
<i>After three months</i>
<i>he would've reached the Vézére-valley.</i>

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,930
<i>The sight of the Lascaux paintings</i>
<i>would've provoked a delirious fit.</i>

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,449
<i>Believing he knew Japanese, -</i>

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,458
<i>- he'd follow a tourist group</i>
<i>from Hiroshima an entire day, -</i>

22
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,619
<i>- before collapsing.</i>
<i>Diagnosis: Acute Stendhal Syndrome.</i>

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,538
<i>The urge to write</i>
<i>would again have resurfaced.</i>

24
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,737
January. Oslo.

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,778
<i>The loss of Phillip</i>
<i>would've become a loss of inspiration.</i>

26
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,012
<i>The writer's block was a fact.</i>

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,453
<i>Author Sten Egil Dahl would have</i>
<i>convinced Erik to go abroad to write.</i>

28
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,459
<i>She was a French publisher's daughter.</i>
<i>Her father had idealized her, -</i>

29
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,415
<i>- causing a deep inferiority complex,</i>
<i>both physical and intellectual.</i>

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,375
<i>On October 24 she would have</i>
<i>thrown herself from their balcony.</i>

31
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,334
<i>Her letter would've suggested it was</i>
<i>their happiness she couldn't deal with.</i>

32
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,533
<i>Erik would've felt ashamed by the</i>
<i>creativity triggered by her death.</i>

33
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,258
<i>They would have met</i>
<i>by chance at a café...</i>

34
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,417
<i>No, on the street.</i>

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,775
<i>On the Metro...</i>
<i>...at an airport...</i>

36
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,212
<i>No, in the Luxembourg Garden.</i>

37
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,131
<i>They would have realized</i>
<i>they were both writing the same book.</i>

38
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,777
<i>The book would've triggered a revolution</i>
<i>in East Africa, -</i>

39
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,972
<i>- been banned by the Vatican</i>,
<i>disillusioned the Dalai Lama, -</i>

40
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,058
<i>- and shaped the sexuality of Frode -</i>

41
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,852
<i>- a 12 year old son of a pastry chef -</i>

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,938
<i>- who would've happened to read...</i>

43
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,572
This is when it all begins.

44
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,293
We have to get out of this country.

45
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,088
<i>Erik was relieved when his</i>
<i>suspicions were finally confirmed.</i>

46
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,375
<i>He was utterly without talent.</i>

47
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,739
<i>Phillip's manuscript was accepted.</i>
<i>His book was released in the fall.</i>

48
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,854
Hi.

49
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,056
SIX MONTHS LATER

50
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,336
These are great CDs.
Chris De Burgh, Sissel...

51
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,135
- Pan Pipe Moods?
- Those are dad's old CDs.

52
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,454
- They came with the car.
- Came with the car?

53
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,892
Air condition and Pan Pipe Moods
is standard equipment in a Volvo?

54
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,819
Hi.

55
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,252
- Is that everything?
- I think so.

56
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,656
Thanks.

57
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,579
It'll be nice to come home
to your apartment, your PC...

58
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,853
Maybe you can start writing again.

59
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,578
- Do you have any music we can play?
- Eh... No.

60
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,089
Did you get hold of
any good drugs, Phillip?

61
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,930
I actually talked to a doctor who...

62
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,059
They said
down at the hospital that...

63
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,853
That more people
get addicted to...

64
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,609
I'm sorry,
but right now you sound like Geir.

65
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,613
Shit...

66
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,012
Nice friends.

67
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,530
Geir.

68
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,893
Could we drop by Bygdoy?

69
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,018
Isn't it a little too cold for that?

70
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,409
<i>The punk band</i> Kommune <i>played their</i>
<i>farewell concert on Dec. 27, 1999.</i>

71
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,850
Next song:
"Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister".

72
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,056
<i>Morten, a diehard fan, missed</i>
<i>his train and had to bike 50 km.</i>

73
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,691
<i>After 12 minutes,</i>
<i>he got a knee in his eye.</i>

74
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,380
<i>His first encounter</i>
<i>with Phillip and the others.</i>

75
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,610
<i>Ironic punk quickly evolved</i>
<i>into cynical commercialism:</i>

76
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,049
<i>Henning started an ad agency.</i>

77
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,532
This is... Katinka.

78
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,614
<i>Morten quit college to work for</i>
<i>Henning as a "creative" consultant.</i>

79
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,056
She's discussing ads in public spaces.

80
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,136
I'm just trying to get her to bed.

81
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,689
Hi, Lillian.

82
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,416
<i>Erik kept his girlfriend</i>
<i>at a safe distance from his friends.</i>

83
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,452
Tonight?
I don't know.

84
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,460
<i>Morten asked Geir what she was like. -</i>

85
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,099
<i>Geir said she was "Intelligent".</i>

86
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,533
<i>Morten therefore assumed she was</i>
<i>ugly. Geir pretended to agree.</i>

87
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,017
<i>A drunk Geir had once told Erik</i>
<i>he feared they were friends with him -</i>

88
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,131
<i>- just because his brother</i>
<i>was in the band.</i>

89
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,651
<i>Erik then had to wait two days</i>
<i>before asking him for free tickets.</i>

90
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,338
- What does that mean?

91
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,893
"Que le tout"?

92
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,898
Phillip, please turn
it down a little.

93
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,972
Violins are nice. but...

94
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,337
"The only thing left,
is everything."

95
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,338
"The whole."

96
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,214
- Hi, Phillip!
- Hi, mom.

97
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,413
Hi.

98
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,458
- How is it going?
- Fine, I think.

99
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,658
- Was the drive OK?
- Yes.

100
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,617
- Not too much traffic?
- No, we stopped at Bygdoy.

101
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,458
Have you removed my things?

102
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,770
Well, I had to tidy up a bit.

103
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,772
- Where are the pictures of Kari?
- We talked about this.

104
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,371
- You just took them down?
- It's for your own good.

105
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,620
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Maybe I forgot. The doctor...

106
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,298
Give me my keys, mom.

107
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,894
It's only practical
that someone has a spare set.

108
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,411
Hey...

109
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,611
Maybe you should take the keys.

110
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,177
Think about it. You'll probably
write something incredible now.

111
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,375
- How's your writing going?
- To hell.

112
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,334
I've reworked
that last one I sent in.

113
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,692
Think you could take a look at it?

114
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,250
You should just send it in.
I'm sure it's excellent.

115
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,298
Should we head home?

116
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,691
Am I tired already?

117
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,969
Sales is about desire,
commitment, knowledge...

118
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,888
Good. Fhaisal,
but you forget one key point:

119
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,094
You can't sell over the phone, until
you have learned to sell yourself.

120
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,652
You should leave modesty at the door
before entering here.

121
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,212
Oops! Modesty just
got run over by a steamroller.

122
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,655
Toss the ball to someone, Fhaisal.

123
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,058
OK, who are you?

124
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,058
- Kari.
- Who are you?

125
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,774
Kari.

126
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,050
<i>Kari grew up on the east side of town -</i>

127
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,330
<i>- Phillip on the west.</i>

128
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,252
<i>Still Phillip insisted he had seen</i>
<i>her before: Independence Day 1989 -</i>

129
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,895
<i>- he had gotten lost and ended</i>
<i>up marching with the wrong school.</i>

130
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,417
<i>Kari didn't believe him,</i>
<i>but liked the idea.</i>

131
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,739
<i>At 18 Kari met Rune,</i>
<i>the former guitarist in "Kommune", -</i>

132
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,132
<i>- now frontman in "Mondo Topless", -</i>

133
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,856
<i>- incidentally the worst use of a Russ</i>
<i>Meyer film title as a band name ever.</i>

134
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,853
<i>Fucking hippies!</i>

135
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,534
<i>After dating Rune for three years,</i>
<i>Kari started noticing Phillip.</i>

136
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,769
<i>She thought he was cute,</i>
<i>but was sure he was gay.</i>

137
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,697
<i>She asked Rune who they were.</i>

138
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,813
Just some spoiled rich kids
from the West Side.

139
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,817
I heard one of them
wrote this weird book.

140
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,931
<i>Phillip later told Kari he knew</i>
<i>they were destined for each other.</i>

141
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,014
<i>In ten seconds</i>
<i>she will look at him.</i>

142
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,299
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five,

143
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,410
four.

144
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,529
three.

145
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,775
two.

146
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,374
one...

147
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,337
<i>The next day</i>
<i>he invited her to Paris.</i>

148
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,176
<i>Phillip's sarcastic humor</i>
<i>made her gasp with laughter.</i>

149
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,860
<i>Phillip said</i>
<i>her gasping was repulsive.</i>

150
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,654
<i>This only made her gasp even more.</i>
<i>His gaze made her feel pretty.</i>

151
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,248
<i>Phillip loved her parodies</i>
<i>of "sexy" girls in music videos.</i>

152
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,658
<i>She was the only girl he had met who</i>
<i>had Ramones "Road to Ruin" on vinyl.</i>

153
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,772
<i>He enjoyed that they both</i>
<i>admitted actually disliking the Clash.</i>

154
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,214
Are you OK?

155
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,219
I'm fine.

156
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,489
- Hi.
- It's amazing.

157
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,418
This is incredible.

158
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,418
In the subway...
I didn't see the sign...

159
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,169
I sat down, and he said I...
shouldn't... It was painted...

160
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,417
But there wasn't any paint...

161
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,451
You have paint on your jacket.
There's paint all over your back.

162
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,217
No, there isn't.

163
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,490
- There was something... Fuck.
- Phillip, what's wrong?

164
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,170
It's just... I... I...

165
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,735
It wasn't by chance.

166
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,696
It was no coincidence that we met.

167
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,337
<i>The doctors said his obsessive romance</i>
<i>with Kari had triggered his psychosis.</i>

168
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,809
<i>When Phillip was committed,</i>
<i>Kari was advised not to visit him.</i>

169
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,018
Hi.

170
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,608
I let myself in.
Where have you been?

171
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,771
- I kept trying the doorbell.
- I just went to the store.

172
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,293
- I'm fine. Don't worry.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

173
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,650
I just wanted to show you this.

174
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,452
They accepted it. They're
going to publish "Prosopopeia."

175
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,777
That's great!

176
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,930
- Have you told Lillian yet?
- No.

177
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,618
A good book cover is important.

178
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,611
Didn't you say that if
your book was accepted, you would...

179
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,458
What do you mean?

180
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,132
- I have to break up with Lillian.
- You don't have to.

181
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,050
Yes, I do.

182
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,334
We've been going out for three years.

183
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,338
I can't waste any more time.

184
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,094
We can't have girlfriends now.

185
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,098
We're supposed to write and read...

186
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,176
- and hang out with friends.

187
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,092
And if we feel the urge, -

188
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,375
- we'll practice deviant,
fetishistic sex with prostitutes.

189
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,056
You can practice deviant
fetishistic sex with Lillian.

190
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,373
That...

191
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,179
No.

192
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,730
I have to break up with her.

193
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,255
I can't stay with her
just to be nice.

194
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,138
Not that she's terrible to be with.
She's actually pretty cool.

195
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,856
Girls aren't cool. They can be
pretty or "cute" and -

196
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,733
- with some serious dieting, even sexy.

197
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,775
They can be nice. Dumb, but nice
But who wants "nice"?

198
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,813
You want interesting people around you.

199
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,937
Has a girl ever introduced you to
any new music -

200
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,975
- or recommended a book you
didn't already read in high school?

201
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,330
Anything just slightly
outside the mainstream?

202
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,133
If so, she got it from an ex,
her brother, her father.

203
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,899
They just pretend.

204
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,898
It's worse here. On the East Side
they know they're underprivileged.

205
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,459
Here they think they
have to have an opinion.

206
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,534
And intrude on adult conversations.

207
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,689
- Hi.
- Hi, Lillian, it's me.

208
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,249
Guys in long-term relationships
become so lame.

209
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,572
They get sucked into this feminine
sphere of TV-series and nice dinners.

210
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,415
They get less and less time
to read and listen to music.

211
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,576
Eventually they don't even miss it.

212
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,969
They end up as
understimulated, bourgeois retards.

213
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,690
Hi!

214
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,612
<i>If he broke up now, Lillian would</i>
<i>think it's because of the novel.</i>

215
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,211
<i>He'd be a phoney</i>
<i>who dumps girls once he succeeds.</i>

216
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:12,495
<i>She'd think she wasn't good enough</i>
<i>for him. Which wasn't entirely true.</i>

217
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:18,536
<i>And what about all his things? It</i>
<i>would seem cynical to take them now.</i>

218
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,016
<i>But picking them up later</i>
<i>would definitely be wrong...</i>

219
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,131
What's the matter?

220
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,499
Erik, come here a second.

221
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,732
I don't mind you using my PC at all.

222
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,933
But I don't appreciate that -

223
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,614
- things like this pop up,
when I turn it on.

224
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,654
Is this what you look at?
Feel free to talk to me about it.

225
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,097
But what if that girl was me?

226
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,851
<i>What if she can't take it?</i>
<i>That may be conceited of him, but...</i>

227
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,098
Bullshit.

228
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,256
Feeling guilty is slave mentality.

229
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,975
Sometimes you have to
be Zarathustra. Be mean.

230
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,937
I have to tell you...

231
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,376
<i>Suddenly Erik remembered</i>
<i>the last time he was mean.</i>

232
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,060
<i>Erik and Phillip were in 2nd grade.</i>

233
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,737
<i>Phillip had</i>
<i>another best friend:</i>

234
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,616
<i>Erik heard Svein talk</i>
<i>about Phillip to a 6th grader.</i>

235
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,058
You two hang out a lot.
Are you gay, or what?

236
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,172
No, but maybe he is.

237
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,532
<i>Having had a liberal upbringing, Erik</i>
<i>had always defended society's outcasts.</i>

238
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,175
<i>But this time he told everybody</i>
<i>that Svein said Phillip was gay.</i>

239
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,698
<i>Erik's mother heard this from</i>
<i>a classmate and Erik's teacher.</i>

240
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,653
He used "gay" as a term of abuse?

241
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,812
His father is reactionary, but...

242
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,250
<i>An emergency meeting was called.</i>

243
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,250
<i>Svein left the school shortly after.</i>

244
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,610
<i>Years later Svein was seen -</i>

245
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,050
<i>- cutting in line at a liquor store</i>,
<i>pushing a baby carriage.</i>

246
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,132
- My novel was accepted.
- That's great!

247
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,610
Are you still at the university?

248
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,331
I don't know.
It's kind of complicated.

249
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,339
I've considered
studying sociology again.

250
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,054
No... I don't know.

251
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,899
I'm working at the moment.

252
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,613
Hi.

253
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,570
I'm going to get a coffee.

254
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,811
How long has it been?

255
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,935
Seven months.

256
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,571
I can't believe
we're sitting here like this.

257
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,654
Yes...

258
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,770
Remember when I tricked you
into falling in love, in Paris?

259
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,575
- I was already in love with you.
- No, you weren't.

260
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,850
No, you weren't.

261
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,373
You were still into
that "rock star", weren't you?

262
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,816
Poor Rune.

263
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,213
No.

264
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
But we had a nice time, didn't we.

265
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,978
In Paris.

266
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,213
Were you in love with me then?

267
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,935
Yes. I was.

268
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,615
I wasn't sick already then.

269
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,972
I wasn't.

270
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,971
- You've put your hair up.
- Yes.

271
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,410
- I like it.
- No, you don't

272
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,529
I do.
It's just different.

273
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,538
You look nice.

274
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,051
I felt a lot worse afterwards.

275
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,888
I didn't understand anything.

276
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,657
I wanted to call.

277
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,132
But they told me
that wasn't a good idea.

278
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,215
And then I didn't know...

279
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,817
- I didn't know how you felt.
- That must have been hard.

280
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,454
I wish we could just...

281
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,575
Meet all over again.

282
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,418
Forget everything.

283
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,578
Bye.

284
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,332
I must admit.
after reading this I thought:

285
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,577
"He must be some eccentric,
old-before-his-time type".

286
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,531
No offense.

287
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,137
And then you show up.
Look at him!

288
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,855
I mean, he's handsome.
A good-looking boy.

289
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,693
- So what happens now?
- Certain parts will be reworked.

290
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,491
And it needs to be proofread.

291
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,498
But this is a book
It will be published this fall.

292
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,412
This fall?

293
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,258
Isn't that a little soon?

294
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,929
- I just feel...
- Leave the feeling to me.

295
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,050
- But the title: "Prosopopeia"
- We've discussed that.

296
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,855
I like one-word titles myself:
"Hunger", "Underworld"...

297
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,893
- "Prosopopeia" is one word.
- He's right about that.

298
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,529
Your first book sets the tone
for your entire authorship.

299
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,694
Imagine a critic writing
a review of "Prozac-and-pee".

300
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,133
- I'm provoking you a little, but...
- I love the title.

301
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,732
There's something about
your thematic structure that...

302
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,698
It's interesting that you
know Phillip Reisnes.

303
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,258
Something about your book
reminded me of his.

304
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,819
Maybe you're right.
Thank you.

305
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,578
You and Reisnes...

306
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,290
How old are you? 23?

307
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,696
Fantastic!

308
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,493
A word to the wise:
Never listen to old farts like me.

309
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,052
No, no, no.
Remember what Wittgenstein says:

310
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:12,812
The important things in life are
expressed through music, not words.

311
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,538
I have something I need to do.

312
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,932
Excellent.

313
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,774
Have you read Ottar Tomte? We're marking
the release of his posthumous poetry.

314
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,212
- If you want to go.
- Sure. Thanks for the invitation.

315
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,256
- So?
- Who was friends with Ottar Tomte?

316
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,693
Who wrote the epilogue for his book
and will feel obliged to appear?

317
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:56,659
<i>Erik and Phillip discovered</i>
<i>Sten Egil Dahl when they were 17.</i>

318
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,853
<i>They both spent all their lunch money</i>
<i>on books and records.</i>

319
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,619
<i>Sten Egil Dahl</i>
<i>wrote his first novel at age 20.</i>

320
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,939
<i>It was awarded the Nordic</i>
<i>Council's Prize for Literature in 1964.</i>

321
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,737
<i>Unexpectedly, he didn't</i>
<i>show up at the awards ceremony.</i>

322
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,258
<i>This reinforced his reputation as</i>
<i>solitary and detached from reality.</i>

323
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:31,373
China considers it beautiful that
the North Vietnamese are bleeding!

324
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,209
My book has nothing to do
with Chinese politics!

325
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,934
I'm afraid the debate has to end here.

326
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,573
Thank you.

327
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,976
<i>Sten Egil Dahl moved to Paris,</i>
<i>where he wrote his second novel.</i>

328
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,971
<i>He soon withdrew from public life.</i>

329
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,649
<i>Before returning to Norway,</i>
<i>he only had contact -</i>

330
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,931
<i>- with reclusive author</i>
<i>Maurice Blanchot.</i>

331
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,893
<i>Little is known</i>
<i>about Dahl after this.</i>

332
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,410
<i>He published a few books</i>,
<i>but remained a recluse.</i>

333
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,930
<i>He lived isolated in a house</i>
<i>by the Frogner Park.</i>

334
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,973
<i>Erik found a cryptic passage</i>
<i>in "Crystal" -</i>

335
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,410
<i>- where the Monolith statue,</i>
<i>observed from a window -</i>

336
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,815
<i>- was described as a sundial.</i>

337
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,890
- That must be the house.
- Yes.

338
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,494
<i>Phillip's first work was called</i>
<i>"Dust". Erik was impressed.</i>

339
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:34,935
<i>Erik's story took three months.</i>
<i>He claimed he wrote it in one night.</i>

340
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,735
It works better
if you remove the lens cap.

341
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,049
Listen, "Rain Man", have you been
out of the apartment yet?

342
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,490
- I went to the pharmacy yesterday.
- The pharmacy?

343
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,778
- So you'll go?
- I guess.

344
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,930
And dad says, "Henning, give Geir
more space around the dinner table."

345
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,214
I thought, "Is he planning on
getting fatter?" He was a chubby kid.

346
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,777
- No, I wasn't.
- You were our own Michelin Man.

347
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,136
- How much do you weigh now?
- 75.

348
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,818
Erik?

349
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,449
Johanne, from the publisher's.

350
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,697
Of course!
Good to see you again.

351
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,933
Feel free to join us.

352
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,294
Thanks.

353
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,570
- Johanne works with my publisher.
- Well I'm also working on my MA.

354
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,329
I was a big fan
of Erik's manuscript.

355
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,288
What is your master's thesis about?

356
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,857
I'll probably change it a bit.

357
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:03,453
But it's basically about contemporary
literature. The new Norwegian authors.

358
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,053
Anyway, things are more exciting
for you, with your upcoming release.

359
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,171
You're Phillip, right?

360
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,450
"Phantom Images" is
one of my favourite books ever.

361
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,532
Particularly that long passage
toward the end.

362
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,419
Is that how you work now?

363
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,013
Phillip has been
a little tired lately.

364
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,934
But he's better now.
Right?

365
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,894
Soon you'll write
something awesome again.

366
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,130
- We had a meeting today.
- Sebastian. Hi.

367
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,851
A new cell phone ad campaign.

368
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,889
I like the edge.
It's quirky, it's weird. It works.

369
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,174
We made small talk, wondered if
we had any mutual acquaintances.

370
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,015
It turns out we did.

371
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,019
- Lars Henriksen?
- No. Lars Etterstad.

372
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,412
- Did he go to Berg High School?
- Yes.

373
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,136
Porno Lars?
They know Porno!

374
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,491
You guys know Porno Lars?

375
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:28,569
This consultant had lived
in that flat share with Lars.

376
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,018
Lars came home late one night.

377
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,650
He asked if Lars wanted a glass
of wine. But Lars answered:

378
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,169
I'm trying to cut back on TV.

379
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,339
He said he was going to read
his new Heidegger book.

380
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,698
But thanks for the offer.

381
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,340
Look at him. He has no idea
that he goes by the name of Porno Lars.

382
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,256
Careful, Lars. Too much Heidegger
can make you dizzy.

383
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,369
What's he saying?
I can't understand his dialect.

384
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,891
What's that tattoo? An ad?

385
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,052
"Oslo City Shopping Centre"?

386
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,252
- No, don't! I'm dry!
- Oh really?

387
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,498
So you're getting your master's?

388
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,379
Are you OK?

389
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,453
Sure. I just don't understand
your friends' humor.

390
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,888
What's Mathis Wergeland's
book called, Erik?

391
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,978
"That Which Ties Us Down."
- Right.

392
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,890
That which Ties Us Down.
"Ties"...

393
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,615
- I liked Mathis' book.
- I figured.

394
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,531
If he had written in English,
he would be world famous by now.

395
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,096
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous? Me?

396
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,179
I knew him before he was famous
and he was a jerk even then.

397
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,532
Oh "jerk" was he. Well, not everyone
can become a famous author.

398
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,255
You do have a point. "Jerk" isn't
precise enough to describe him.

399
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,450
I wish Mathis would -

400
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,978
- choke on black cock in hell, that
politically correct fascist cunt.

401
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,169
No...

402
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,253
That's enough!

403
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,730
- He's just kidding.
- No I'm not.

404
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,296
I don't care, I've had it.
I hate people like him.

405
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:15,138
What you hate is war and George Bush
and the World Bank and such.

406
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,656
Who the hell do you think you are?

407
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,579
You are the most immature
people I have ever met!

408
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:30,570
Spreading nasty rumours about
each other... I feel sorry for you.

409
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,693
- And for him.
- Me? What are you talking about?

410
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,493
Why do you hang out with these people?

411
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,979
Sorry for me?

412
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,170
- What's she talking about?
- I've met guys like you before.

413
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,575
I just have one thing to say:

414
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:55,173
It can't be easy to
have problems in this crowd.

415
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,376
You're so cute when you're mad.

416
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,851
And you are incredibly banal!

417
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,969
She seemed nice.

418
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,536
Bye.

419
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,853
Hi.

420
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,574
- Hi, Erik!
- Hi.

421
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,768
- Long time no see.
- Isn't Lillian here?

422
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,295
No.

423
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,693
Does anyone want a drink?

424
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,413
- I think I'll wait.
- No, thanks.

425
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,256
- Have you seen Sten Egil Dahl?
- I doubt he'll show.

426
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,213
- But you and...?
- I just wanted her to come.

427
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,450
Are you sure that's a good idea?

428
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,856
What does your psychiatrist say?

429
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,490
Is it a problem that Kari is here?

430
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,817
- I didn't mean it like that.

431
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,691
- How are you doing?
- Fine. So-so, I guess.

432
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,217
- Are you still at the university?
- No, I don't know

433
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,852
- I'm in telemarketing.
- How interesting.

434
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,735
No. It isn't.
Actually, it sucks.

435
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,331
I heard your book
is getting published.

436
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,458
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous about that.

437
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,771
There's Mathis Wergeland.

438
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,890
Please don't come over,
you superficial imbecile.

439
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,690
Shit.

440
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,494
Look at this!
Phillip Reisnes.

441
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,453
Long time no see.
Good to have you back.

442
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,457
Are you writing?

443
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,657
No, I'm... that is...

444
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,095
Hi.
Erik. Erik Hoiaas

445
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,496
This is Kari... Kari...

446
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,930
Kari-Kari? Nice to meet you.

447
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,651
I really believe in this guy.

448
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,334
See you around, all right?

449
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,653
I... I don't think...

450
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,892
I have to go.

451
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,620
Don't let him bother you.

452
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,459
I just don't feel well.

453
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,253
- I'm tired.
- What about Sten Egil Dahl?

454
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,416
Do you want to go home?

455
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,058
I can't do this. Sorry.

456
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,091
- This was a mistake.
- Don't worry about it.

457
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,340
It just isn't like it used to be.

458
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:12,489
I know it's important to Erik,
but I don't want to write anymore.

459
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,015
Having fun?

460
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,813
- Yes.
- Have you thought about your title?

461
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,057
- Yes, I've thought about it.
- Excellent.

462
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,179
I think "Prosopopeia"
is a good title.

463
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,938
Don't you?

464
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,449
Don't ask me, tell me.

465
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:21,096
Say: The book's title is
"Prosopopeia", dammit!

466
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:26,010
I'll remember that. Thanks.
We'll talk later.

467
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,131
Sten Egil Dahl?

468
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,297
My name is Erik Hoiaas.
I'm a big fan of your work.

469
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,174
- It's a great honour for me...
- Hey, Erik! Hi.

470
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,851
Mathis Wergeland.
I'm a big fan of yours.

471
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,212
Well "fan" is a little teenage,
but "admirer" is so formal.

472
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,971
"Crystal" is just amazing.

473
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,973
Your opening chapter there...

474
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,490
There's this...

475
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,975
This...

476
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,490
- Don't you agree?
- Absolutely.

477
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,408
- Do you write as well?
- Yes, I have written a book.

478
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,416
You probably haven't read it.

479
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,889
It hasn't been published yet.

480
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,969
- Then I probably haven't read it.
- But it will be published.

481
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,890
Excuse me,
I was on my way home.

482
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,329
But your book has been accepted?

483
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:48,933
<i>Erik knew that in S. E. Dahl's mind, he</i>
<i>and Mathis were now indistinguishable.</i>

484
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,339
Phillip?

485
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,172
What's wrong?

486
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,372
I just don't feel...

487
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,096
I couldn't sleep... and...

488
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,090
It helps to turn up the volume.

489
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,852
I took a little too much Seroquel

490
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,891
I couldn't sleep!

491
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,656
You're taking your medication?

492
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:26,850
Did something happen
between you and Kari?

493
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,938
Don't baby-sit me.
I need time to myself.

494
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,015
No problem.

495
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,139
Hello?

496
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,213
Hi.

497
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,333
Why did you buy me a plane ticket?

498
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,572
Did you look at the date?

499
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,255
The exact same date

500
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,853
as the last time we went.

501
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,051
You can't just assume that

502
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,252
I can, or want to, go to Paris.

503
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,416
No pressure.

504
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,255
But can you at least consider it?

505
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,775
Lars mentioned that Phillip
and Kari were going to Paris again.

506
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,977
Erik pretended that Phillip
had already told him.

507
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,133
He studied chemistry. Was brilliant.
The best in his class.

508
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,731
He got headhunted to some
pharmaceutical company in the USA.

509
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,692
But his girlfriend couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship.

510
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,055
She got depressed. Said
she couldn't function without him.

511
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,500
So he quit his job
and moved back home.

512
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:59,740
After a few weeks, she dumped him.
Didn't really love him anymore.

513
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:04,456
He was unable to go back to work.
Now he lives with his mom.

514
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,809
You live with your mom, don't you?

515
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,258
Hi, Lillian!

516
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,331
She's probably frigid.
Any girl that pretty is.

517
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:38,339
- You would know, who's cilibate.
- Cilibate?

518
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,332
- You mean celibate.

519
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,728
- Right, cilibate.

520
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,978
Maybe cilibate is how farmers say it,
but in civilization we say -

521
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,655
- celibate with an e
- You know what I meant.

522
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,419
Tonight?

523
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:02,812
I don't know. I have to try
to write while Phillip is away.

524
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,139
Thank you.

525
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,413
You're so cool!

526
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:15,297
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.

527
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,856
It's so embarrassing.

528
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,974
Anyway, my point is
that you need to get laid.

529
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:30,175
- Why don't you go see Lillian?
- I thought maybe we could...

530
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,052
- I can get laid whenever I want.
- With that Hitler Youth haircut?

531
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,169
I'm out of here.
Bye.

532
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,012
Bye!

533
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,970
- We were on the 4th floor last time.
- This room is nice.

534
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:38,532
- We had a nice time?
- Absolutely.

535
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,290
I may have been a little nervous.

536
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,373
- How did I seem to you?

537
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,580
- You seemed happy.

538
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,298
What did we do the next day?

539
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,656
We sat at a café
and talked for ages.

540
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,578
- What was the weather like?
- Raining, I think.

541
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:21,056
- What did we talk about?
- Everything. I can't remember.

542
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,410
But it was nice.

543
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,859
What was I like?
Was I happy?

544
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,615
- Don't you remember?
- Sure.

545
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,097
I'm glad you came.

546
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,096
You were thinking about Rune.

547
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,092
I decided I had to make you
fall in love with me.

548
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,616
- You were unsure of your feelings.
- No, I wasn't.

549
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,212
Sure you were.

550
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:05,178
Anyway, it worked.
It worked because I told you first.

551
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:09,413
"When I reach zero,
you'll fall in love with me."

552
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,575
Ten.

553
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,573
Nine.

554
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,893
Eight.

555
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,177
What are you doing?

556
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,452
Seven, six...

557
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,739
Five.

558
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,859
Four.

559
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,053
Three.

560
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,294
Two.

561
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,538
One.

562
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,293
Zero.

563
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:30,617
You must have sat and slid down.
Your skirt had been pulled up.

564
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:37,056
Don't worry.
You looked incredible.

565
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,608
- It feels stupid.
- Don't worry about that.

566
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,937
- Can't we...
- Come on!

567
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,293
Come on.

568
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,570
Look to the left.

569
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,452
A little down.

570
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,611
Gather your legs.

571
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,418
It's uncomfortable.

572
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,288
- We had sex the second night.
- They know what "sex" means.

573
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,812
No they don't. It's just
strange noises to them.

574
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,929
The French don't even understand
English without a French accent.

575
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,849
I don't think
it was until the third night.

576
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,939
- Why was I so nervous?
- You were so cute.

577
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,332
You kept talking about
how the first time never is any good.

578
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,219
No, wait.

579
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,851
What's the matter?

580
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,410
What are you thinking about?

581
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,293
Nothing.

582
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,256
Say something.

583
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:51,373
Why did you want us
to come back here?

584
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,053
You don't love me anymore,
is that it?

585
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,331
I don't know.

586
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,728
Of course you know.

587
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,618
FALL

588
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:29,610
Erik Hoiaas is here.
Your book has just been published.

589
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,379
"Pro-so-po-peia."

590
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:38,533
You write about madness. Do you
have a personal connection to that?

591
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:44,089
Well... "Prosopopeia", isn't really...

592
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,371
It isn't really about madness.

593
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:52,058
The personal is on a different
level than the biographical.

594
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:59,252
But the protagonist is searching
for "the absolute language".

595
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,775
A language which can grasp
all the world's nuances.

596
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,257
And that is a madness of sorts.

597
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:14,175
A strong personal experience
can become an intense story.

598
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,053
But what I meant to say...

599
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:24,138
Giving details of personal suffering
has become a tabloid requirement.

600
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:30,009
Bringing up
all sorts of personal "tragedies".

601
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,932
But that's not real "literature" is it?

602
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:37,374
John Pedersen,
you became an author late in life.

603
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,849
Your story
is titled "The Long Journey Back".

604
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:50,339
I never thought I would become
an author. But when things...

605
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,535
- Hi, Phillip.
- Hi, Erik Hoiaas, long time no see.

606
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,811
- How's it going?
- I'm not really sure.

607
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:09,330
I don't know if you saw me on TV.
It didn't go well.

608
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:13,890
Forget about that. Come on over.
Geir and Morten are here.

609
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,497
It's been a while.

610
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:22,650
I don't know.
I'm going to Lillian's.

611
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,417
So nothing's changed there?

612
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,732
Then bring her with you.

613
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,771
We've been invited
to a party at Lars'.

614
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:41,374
<i>Two months earlier Lars felt obliged to</i>
<i>mingle with his fellow med-students.</i>

615
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,692
<i>No one had heard from him since.</i>

616
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:49,338
<i>That night Lars had mingled quite</i>
<i>a lot with a girl: Merethe.</i>

617
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,773
Does Lars have a girlfriend?

618
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,810
My God!

619
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,540
Then we have no choice.

620
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,973
OK.

621
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,492
<i>Lillian was understanding</i>
<i>as always when Erik said:</i>

622
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,894
Phillip rang.
He doesn't feel well.

623
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,736
21? This must be it.

624
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,659
Hey...

625
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,454
I can't take it.
It's too sad.

626
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:37,651
- Hey there.
- Hey. Well... quite a party!

627
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:43,814
And <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy!</i>
Out svimming with commoners?

628
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:47,137
We were about to leave,
but now things are picking up.

629
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:53,295
- I brought my friend Johanne.
- Nice to meet you.

630
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:58,620
Come on in.

631
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,058
Sorry.

632
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,332
Are you all right?

633
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,778
Do you know Bjorn?

634
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,094
Yes.

635
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,494
- What's your name?
- Geir.

636
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:43,336
Hi, Geir

637
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,575
Ingrid?

638
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,819
Ingrid!

639
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,132
We've had another complaint.
Can you please...

640
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,814
Henning!

641
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,729
Choke on black cock in hell,
you politically correct fascist cunt!

642
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:16,212
Get some sleep.

643
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,819
Bye.

644
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,494
Five.

645
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,053
Four.

646
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:44,454
Three.

647
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,695
Two.

648
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,419
One.

649
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:48,529
Zero.

650
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:54,696
Ten.

651
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,095
Nine.

652
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,417
Eight, seven, six, five...

653
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:05,614
Four, three, two, one...

654
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,058
Lillian?

655
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,779
Hi.

656
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,615
- How nice.
- Not a word, Erik.

657
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,732
Don't touch me.

658
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,773
Lillian...
Hey, come sit down.

659
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:40,098
I've had enough. Not just because
we never see each other.

660
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,420
It's that you pretend to care,
when you're so damn selfish.

661
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,739
You're such a damn cliché!

662
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,817
Don't call me.

663
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,776
Is he awake?

664
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,972
So you've seen it?

665
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,176
FORM WITHOUT SUBSTANCE.

666
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,132
Want a cup of tea?

667
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,411
Hi, Phillip.

668
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,136
No, I'm a little...

669
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,529
What?
You've written something?

670
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,098
Well...

671
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,493
This is...

672
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:29,814
A lot of it is good, but we've
always been honest with each other.

673
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,215
This isn't your best work.

674
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,295
But it's cool
that you're writing.

675
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,336
What?

676
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,249
I'm glad you take it like that.

677
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:17,493
It just seems... disjointed.
Even for me who knows your style.

678
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,138
I mean, you haven't
slept all night.

679
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:28,857
But there is something here.

680
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:35,697
Your water metaphor
relating to emotional distance, -

681
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,054
- but then that glides into
this erotic thing...

682
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,657
There's a lot here you can work on.

683
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,730
I don't think so.

684
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:54,410
- It's only the first draft.
Don't try to be nice.

685
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:59,250
I'm not being nice. If you work on it
this might be publishable.

686
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:02,178
That isn't important.
I'm just writing for myself.

687
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:08,053
- A lot of this is good.
- No, it isn't!

688
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,091
Why can you never say what you mean?

689
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,973
I mean... You're a great writer.

690
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:26,415
All I've ever done is to recycle
Sten Egil Dahl and Tor Ulven.

691
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,455
It's no big deal.

692
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:43,418
- Is that recycled Sten Egil Dahl too?
- I don't know.

693
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,090
What do you mean?

694
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,578
- What the fuck are you doing?
- He's mine.

695
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,134
- Svein?
- Sorry, Erik.

696
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,457
I'm not a homo!

697
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:30,659
You're Erik Hoiaas, aren't you?

698
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,097
- Yes.
- I saw you on TV last night.

699
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:42,651
- Let me get you to a doctor.
- No, I'm fine.

700
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,212
TV is no place to discuss literature.

701
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,811
I don't know why...

702
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,896
I've read your book.

703
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,372
Great title.

704
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,338
Very good.

705
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,009
Except for the final part.

706
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:28,457
Don't try to be poetic.

707
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:35,736
- Are you serious?
- Yes. But the rest was good.

708
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,011
Very promising.

709
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,093
You...

710
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,769
You look much better now.

711
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:04,889
How do you feel?

712
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,931
Much better.
Much better.

713
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:15,449
<i>An idea had begun to take shape.</i>

714
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,094
<i>Two days later,</i>
<i>- as he lay in bed, irritated by -</i>

715
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:21,098
<i>- the lights from his stereo,</i>
<i>that couldn't be turned off, -</i>

716
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:27,534
<i>- it came to him:</i>
<i>He had to get out of Oslo.</i>

717
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,299
Ten.

718
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,534
Nine.

719
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,134
Eight.

720
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,498
Seven.
Six.

721
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:40,808
Five.

722
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,259
Four.

723
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,059
Three.

724
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,418
Two.

725
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,492
One.

726
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,728
Zero.

727
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:09,890
Hello, my name is Kari Brekke.
May I speak to Linda Saugstad?

728
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:14,415
- Hello, my name is...
- Kari?

729
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,617
I found you.
I managed to find you.

730
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:22,491
You know where I work.

731
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:30,531
It was always meant to be.
There were just so many things...

732
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,016
Something links us together.
I found you here, right?

733
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,815
Everything was a mess.

734
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,380
There was something that...

735
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,616
Excuse me.

736
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,617
Can I help you?

737
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,252
- Listen to me.
- Kari?

738
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:15,852
I love you, Kari.
Everything is in synch now.

739
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,056
I love you.
I love you.

740
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,978
Stop it!

741
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:25,051
I can't take this anymore...

742
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,571
Phillip, hey...

743
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,259
Hey...

744
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,013
Phillip?

745
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,216
- Kari?
- Just...

746
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:53,536
Come on.

747
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:56,618
Get up.

748
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:54,895
<i>Erik would have left without saying</i>
<i>goodbye to Phillip or his friends.</i>

749
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:02,252
<i>He would have found a small</i>
<i>apartment where he could write.</i>

750
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:10,337
<i>Erik would have let nothing interfere</i>
<i>with his creative impulses.</i>

751
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:16,854
<i>Paradoxically, missing friends</i>
<i>and family would have inspired him.</i>

752
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:31,655
<i>After months of hard work,</i>
<i>he would've completed his novel.</i>

753
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:36,172
<i>The next fall Erik's second book</i>
<i>would be published in Norway.</i>

754
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:41,931
<i>The book would've gotten mixed reviews</i>
<i>and sparked a literary debate</i>

755
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,655
<i>- a professor from Denmark</i>
<i>would say in an article:</i>

756
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:51,855
Norway now has two authors of interest:
Sten Egil Dahl and Erik Hoiaas.

757
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:57,657
<i>Erik would feel distanced from</i>
<i>this fuss, working on his new book.</i>

758
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:03,332
<i>Surprisingly, it was a first novel that</i>
<i>was the big hit that fall:</i>

759
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:06,452
<i>A coming of age, Oslo epic:</i> Roundabout

760
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:11,610
It's an attack on the World Bank,
the North-South conflict.

761
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:18,737
- That may not be obvious to everyone.
- No, but all the more important.

762
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,498
Buy it, it's important!

763
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:36,532
<i>After a year abroad, Erik would have</i>
<i>felt it was time to come home.</i>

764
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:47,331
<i>They would have met again at a café.</i>
<i>Or at a restaurant...</i>

765
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:51,415
<i>No, it would have been at a wedding.</i>

766
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,533
Kari is cool.

767
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,969
She's my nurse. Makes sure
I take my medicine, get dressed, -

768
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,658
- gives me sponge baths...

769
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:31,494
Nah, actually, we're pretty happy.

770
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:38,371
You all have girlfriends.
Traitors!

771
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:42,617
You didn't give us a choice,
running off like that.

772
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,176
Quisling.

773
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:50,259
- I'm back at the university.

774
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:53,019
- Studying what?

775
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:58,168
It may seem stupid,
but I'm studying psychology.

776
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,898
That's great!

777
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:04,217
<i>Erik would've feared she thought</i>
<i>he was ironic.</i>

778
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:07,776
<i>He truly thought it was</i>
<i>a touching expression of love.</i>

779
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,331
- He killed himself?
- Yes.

780
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,015
- I thought you knew.
- No.

781
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,532
A few months ago.

782
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:20,210
Does anyone know why?

783
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:26,729
Well, he only had two fans.

784
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:33,014
One went nuts, the other fled
the country. That was the straw...

785
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,692
No, I don't know.

786
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:42,652
This next song is dedicated to
my brother Geir, the politician.

787
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:48,818
Let's hope he doesn't get
"Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister"!

788
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:42,734
<i>The next day Phillip would have told</i>
<i>Erik how much he liked his book.</i>

789
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,575
<i>They would've discussed</i>
<i>S. E. Dahl's suicide,</i>

790
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:49,374
<i>- before Phillip</i>
<i>said he had run into Svein.</i>

791
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:53,135
- He seemed upset about hurting you.
- Me?

792
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:58,052
<i>Phillip's comments would inspire</i>
<i>Erik to keep working on his next novel.</i>

793
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:07,338
How about you?
Aren't you going to write?

794
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,169
No, I don't think so.

795
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:18,730
Though maybe the spirit will
move me again, like last time.

796
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:56,971
- Ten, nine...
- Stop it.

797
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:01,775
Eight, seven, six, five...

798
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,013
Four.

799
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,899
Three.

800
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,939
Two.

801
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,570
One.

802
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,213
Stop (The End)
