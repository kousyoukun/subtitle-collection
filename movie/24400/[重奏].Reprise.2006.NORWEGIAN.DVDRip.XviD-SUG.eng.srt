1
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,629
Are we going to get
something published, or what?

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,990
Or do you just want
to cultivate your angst?

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,793
- There is a reason why we hesitated
- What do you mean?

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,435
- You're the one who stopped.

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,439
- Sure, but I can start walking again.

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,593
Do I really want to
expose the world to this?

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,312
Let's just do it.

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,400
<i>This is when it all beglns.</i>

9
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,829
<i>Their manuscrlpts</i>
<i>would have been accepted immedlately.</i>

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,949
<i>They would've been published the next fall.</i>

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,629
<i>Flnally they would've been authors.</i>

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,154
<i>Their books would have sold poorly.</i>
<i>Erik and Phllllp couldn't care less.</i>

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,277
<i>More importantly, the books' enigmatic</i>
<i>nature would've made them cult classics</i>

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,118
<i>Phllllp would've been</i>
<i>overwhelmed by his success.</i>

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,553
<i>In a burst of hubris he'd declare</i>
<i>his Literary project compLeted and...</i>

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,116
<i>No, It would've been love that caused</i>
<i>Phllllp to lose falth In literature.</i>

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,478
<i>He would have left Oslo</i>
<i>wlthout telling a soul.</i>

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,790
<i>After three months</i>
<i>he would've reached the Vézére- valley.</i>

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,830
<i>The sight of the Lascaux palntings</i>
<i>would've provoked a delirlous flt.</i>

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,349
<i>Believing he knew Japanese,</i> -

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,358
- <i>he'd follow</i> a <i>tourist group</i>
<i>from Hiroshima an entlre day, -

22

- <i>before collapsing.</i>
<i>Diagnosis: Acute Stendhal Syndrome.</i>

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,438
<i>The urge to write</i>
<i>would again have resurfaced.</i>

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,637
January. Oslo.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,678
<i>The loss of Phillip</i>
<i>would've become a loss of Inspiration.</i>

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,912
<i>The writer's block</i> was a <i>fact.</i>

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,353
<i>Author Sten Egil Dahl would have</i>
<i>convinced Erik to go abroad to wrlte.</i>

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,359
<i>She was a French publisher's daughter.</i>
<i>Her father had idealized her,</i> -

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,315
- <i>causlng a deep inferiority complex,</i>
<i>both physlcal and intellectual.</i>

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,275
<i>On October 24 she would have</i>
<i>thrown herself from their balcony.</i>

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,234
<i>Her letter would've suggested it was</i>
<i>thelr happiness she couldn't deal with.</i>

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,433
<i>Erik would've felt ashamed by the</i>
<i>creativlty triggered by her death.</i>

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,158
<i>They would have met</i>
<i>by chance at a café...</i>

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,317
<i>No, on the street.</i>

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,675
<i>On the Metro....</i>
<i>...at an airport....</i>

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,112
<i>No, In the Luxembourg Garden.</i>

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,031
<i>They would have realized</i>
<i>they were both wrltlng the same book.</i>

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,677
<i>The book would've trlggered a revolutlon</i>

- <i>and shaped the sexuality of Frode</i> -

41

- <i>who would've happened to</i> read...

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,472
This is when it all begins.

44
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,193
We have to get out of this country.

45
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,988
<i>Erik</i> was <i>relieved when hls</i>
<i>suspicions were finally confirmed.</i>

46
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,275
<i>He was utterly wlthout talent.</i>

47
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,639
<i>Phllllp's manuscript was accepted.</i>
<i>His book was released in the fall.</i>

48
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,754
Hi.

49
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,956
SIX MONTHS LATER

50
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,236
These are great CDs.
Chris De Burgh, Sissel...

51
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,035
- Pan Pipe Moods?
- Those are dad's old CDs.

52
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,354
- They came with the car.
- Came with the car?

53
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,792
Air condition and Pan Pipe Moods
is standard equipment in a Volvo?

54
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,719
Hi.

55
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,152
- Is that everything?
- I think so.

56
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,556
Thanks.

57
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,479
It'll be nice to come home
to your apartment, your PC...

58
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,753
Maybe you can start writing again.

59
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,478
- Do you have any music we can play?
- Eh... No.

60
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,989
Did you get hold of
any good drugs, Phillip?

61
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,830
I actually talked to a doctor who...

62
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,959
They said
down at the hospital that...

63
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,753
That more people
get addicted to...

64
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,509
I'm sorry,
but right now you sound like Geir.

65
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,513
Shit...

66
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,912
Nice friends.

67
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,430
Geir.

68
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,793
Could we drop by Bygdoy?

69
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,918
Isn't it a little too cold for that?

70
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,309
<i>The punk band</i> Kommune <i>played their</i>
<i>farewell concert on Dec. 27, 1999.</i>

71
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,750
Next song:
''Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister''.

72
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,956
<i>Morten, a diehard fan, mlssed</i>
<i>hls train and had to bike 50 km.</i>

73
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,591
<i>After 12 minutes,</i>

74
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,280
<i>His first encounter</i>

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,432
This is... Katinka.

78
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,514
<i>Morten quit college to work for</i>
<i>Henning as</i> a <i>" creative'' consultant.</i>

79
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,956
She's discussing ads in public spaces.

80
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,036
I'm just trying to get her to bed.

81
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,589
Hi, Lillian.

82
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,316
<i>Erik kept his glrlfriend</i>
<i>at a safe distance from his frlends.</i>

83
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,352
Tonight?
I don't know.

84
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,360
<i>Morten asked Geir what she was llke.</i> -

85
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,999
<i>Geir said she was ''lntelligent."</i>

86
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,433
<i>Morten therefore assumed she was</i>
<i>ugly. Geir pretended to agree.</i>

87
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,917
<i>A drunk Geir had once told Erik</i>
<i>he feared they were friends with hlm -

88
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,031
- <i>Just because his brother</i>

89
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,551
<i>Erik then had to wait two days</i>
<i>before asking him for free tickets.</i>

90
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,238
- What does that mean?

91
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,793
''Que le <i>tout''?</i>

92
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,798
Phillip, please turn
it down a little.

93
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,872
Violins are nice, but...

94
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,237
''The only thing left,
is <i>everything.''</i>

95
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,238
''The <i>whole.''</i>

96
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,114
- Hi, Phillip!
- Hi, mom.

97
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,313
Hi.

98
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,358
- How is it going?
- Fine, I think.

99
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,558
- Was the drive OK?
- Yes.

100
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,517
- Not too much traffic?
- No, we stopped at Bygdoy.

101
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,358
Have you removed my things?

102
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,670
Well, I had to tidy up a bit.

103
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,672
- Where are the pictures of Kari?
- We talked about this.

104
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,271
- You just took them down?
- It's for your own good.

105
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,520
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Maybe I forgot. The doctor...

106
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,198
Give me my keys, mom.

107
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,794
It's only practical
that someone has a spare set.

108
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,311
Hey...

109
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,511
Maybe you should take the keys.

110
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,077
Think about it. You'll probably
write something incredible now.

111
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,275
- How's your writing going?
- To hell.

112
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,234
I've reworked
that last one I sent in.

113
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,592
Think you could take a look at it?

114
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,150
You should just send it in.
I'm sure it's excellent.

115
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,198
Should we head home?

116
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,591
Am I tired already?

117
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,869
Sales is about desire,
commitment, knowledge...

118
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,788
Good, Fhaisal,
but you forget one key point:

119
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,994
You can't sell over the phone, until
you have learned to sell yourself.

120
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,552
You should leave modesty at the door
before entering here.

121
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,112
Oops! Modesty just
got run over by a steamroller.

122
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,555
Toss the ball to someone, Fhaisal.

123
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,958
OK, who are you?

124
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,958
- Kari.
- Who are you?

125
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,674
Kari.

128
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,152
<i>Still Phillip insisted he had seen</i>
<i>her before: Independence Day 1989</i> -

129

- <i>he had gotten lost and ended</i>

<i>Fucking hipplesl</i>

135

<i>but was sure he was gay.</i>

137
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,597
<i>She asked Rune who they</i> were.

138
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,713
Just some spoiled rich kids
from the West Side.

139
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,717
I heard one of them
wrote this weird book.

140

Two.

<i>His gaze made her feel pretty.</i>

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,148
<i>Phllllp loved her parodles</i>
<i>of ''sexy'' glrls in music vldeos.</i>

151
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,558
<i>She was the only glrl he had met who</i>
<i>had Ramones' ''Road to Ruln'' on vinyl.</i>

152
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,672
<i>He enJoyed that they both</i>
<i>admitted actually dlsllking the Clash.</i>

153
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,114
Are you OK?

154
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,119
I'm fine.

155
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,389
- Hi.
- It's amazing.

156
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,318
This is incredible.

157
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,318
In the subway...
I didn't see the sign...

158
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,069
I sat down, and he said I...
shouldn't... It was painted...

159
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,317
But there wasn't any paint...

160
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,351
You have paint on your jacket.
There's paint all over your back.

161
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,117
No, there isn't.

162
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,390
- There was something... Fuck.
- Phillip, what's wrong?

163
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,070
It's just... l... I...

164
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,635
It wasn't by chance.

165
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,596
It was no coincidence that we met.

166
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,237
<i>The doctors said his obsessive romance</i>
<i>wlth Kari had trlggered his psychosis.</i>

167
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,709
<i>When Phillip was commltted,</i>
<i>Karl was advised not to visit him.</i>

168
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,918
Hi.

169
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,508
I let myself in.
Where have you been?

170
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,671
- I kept trying the doorbell.
- I just went to the store.

171
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,193
- I'm fine. Don't worry.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

172
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,550
I just wanted to show you this.

173
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,352
They accepted it. They're
going to publish ''Prosopopeia.''

174
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,677
That's great!

175
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,830
- Have you told Lillian yet?
- No.

176
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,518
A good book cover is important.

177
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,511
Didn't you say that if
your book was accepted, you would...

178
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,358
What do you mean?

179
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,032
- I have to break up with Lillian.
- You don't have to.

180
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,950
Yes, I do.

181
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,234
We've been going out for three years.

182
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,238
I can't waste any more time.

183
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,994
We can't have girlfriends now.

184
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,998
We're supposed to write and read...

185
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,076
- and hang out with friends.

186
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,992
And if we feel the urge, -

187
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,275
- we'll practice deviant,
fetishistic sex with prostitutes.

188
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,956
You can practice deviant
fetishistic sex with Lillian.

189
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,273
That...

190
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,079
No.

191
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,630
I have to break up with her.

192
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,155
I can't stay with her
just to be nice.

193
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,038
Not that she's terrible to be with.
She's actually pretty cool.

194
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,756
Girls aren't cool. They can be
pretty or ''cute'' and -

195
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,633
- with some serious dieting, even sexy.

196
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,675
They can be nice. Dumb, but nice
But who wants <i>''nice''?</i>

197
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,713
You want interesting people around you.

198
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,837
Has a girl ever introduced you to
any new music -

199
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,875
- or recommended a book you
didn't already read in high school?

200
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,230
Anything just slightly
outside the mainstream?

201
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,033
If so, she got it from an ex,
her brother, her father.

202
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,799
They just pretend.

203
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,798
It's worse here. On the East Side
they know they're underprivileged.

204
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,359
Here they think they
have to have an opinion.

205
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,434
And intrude on adult conversations.

206
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,589
- Hi.
- Hi, Lillian, it's me.

207
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,149
Guys in long-term relationships
become so lame.

208
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,472
They get sucked into this feminine
sphere of TV-series and nice dinners.

209
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,315
They get less and less time
to read and listen to music.

210
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,476
Eventually they don't even miss it.

211
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,869
They end up as
understimulated, bourgeois retards.

212
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,590
Hi!

213
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,512
<i>If he broke up now, Lillian would</i>
<i>think it's because of the novel.</i>

214
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,111
<i>He'd be a phoney</i>
<i>who dumps girls once he succeeds.</i>

215
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,395
<i>She'd think she wasn't good enough</i>
<i>for him. Which wasn't entirely true.</i>

216
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,436
<i>And what about all his things? It</i>
<i>would seem cynical to take them now.</i>

217
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,916
<i>But plcklng them up later</i>
<i>would deflnltely be wrong...</i>

218
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,031
What's the matter?

219
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,399
Erik, come here a second.

220
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,632
I don't mind you using my PC at all.

221
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,833
But I don't appreciate that -

222
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,514
- things like this pop up,
when I turn it on.

223
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,554
Is this what you look at?
Feel free to talk to me about it.

224
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,997
But what if that girl was me?

225
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,751
<i>What if she can't take it?</i>
<i>That may be conceited of him, but...</i>

226
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,998
Bullshit.

227
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,156
Feeling guilty is slave mentality.

228
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,875
Sometimes you have to
be Zarathustra. Be mean.

229
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,837
I have to tell you...

230
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,276
<i>Suddenly Erik remembered</i>
<i>the last time he was</i> mean.

231
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,960
<i>Erik and Phllllp were in 2nd grade.</i>

232
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,637
<i>Phllllp had</i>
<i>another best friend:</i>

233
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,516
<i>Erik heard Svein talk</i>
<i>about Phillip to a 6th grader.</i>

234
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,958
You two hang out a lot.
Are you gay, or what?

235
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,072
No, but maybe he is.

236
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,432
<i>Having had</i> a <i>llberal upbrlnging, Erik</i>
<i>had always defended society's outcasts.</i>

237
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,075
<i>But this time he told everybody</i>
<i>that Sveln said Phillip was gay.</i>

238
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,598
<i>Erik's mother heard this from</i>
<i>a classmate and Erik's teacher.</i>

239
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,553
He used ''gay'' as a term of abuse?

240
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,712
His father is reactionary, but...

241
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,150
<i>An emergency meetlng was called.</i>

242
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,150
<i>Sveln left the school shortly after.</i>

243
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,510
<i>Years later Svein was seen -

244
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,950
- <i>cuttlng in line at a liquor store,</i>
<i>pushing a baby carriage.</i>

245
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,032
- My novel was accepted.
- That's great!

246
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,510
Are you still at the university?

247
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,231
I don't know.
It's kind of complicated.

248
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,239
I've considered
studying sociology again.

249
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,954
No... I don't know.

250
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,799
I'm working at the moment.

251
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,513
Hi.

252
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,470
I'm going to get a coffee.

253
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,711
How long has it been?

254
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,835
Seven months.

255
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,471
I can't believe
we're sitting here like this.

256
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,554
Yes...

257
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,670
Remember when I tricked you
into falling in love, in Paris?

258
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,475
- I was already in love with you.
- No, you weren't.

259
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,750
No, you weren't.

260
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,273
You were still into
that ''rock star'', weren't you?

261
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,716
Poor Rune.

262
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,113
No.

263
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,920
But we had a nice time, didn't we.

264
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,878
In Paris.

265
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,113
Were you in love with me then?

266
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,835
Yes. I was.

267
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,515
I wasn't sick already then.

268
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,872
I wasn't.

269
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,871
- You've put your hair up.
- Yes.

270
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,310
- I like it.
- No, you don't

271
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,429
I do.
It's just different.

272
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,438
You look nice.

273
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,951
I felt a lot worse afterwards.

274
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,788
I didn't understand anything.

275
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,557
I wanted to call.

276
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,032
But they told me
that wasn't a good idea.

277
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,115
And then I didn't know...

278
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,717
- I didn't know how you felt.
- That must have been hard.

279
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,354
I wish we could just...

280
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,475
Meet all over again.

281
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,318
Forget everything.

282
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,478
Bye.

283
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,232
I must admit,
after reading this I thought:

284
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,477
''He must be some eccentric,
old-before-his-time type''.

285
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,431
No offense.

286
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,037
And then you show up.
Look at him!

287
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,755
I mean, he's handsome.
A good-looking boy.

288
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,593
- So what happens now?
- Certain parts will be reworked.

289
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,391
And it needs to be proofread.

290
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,398
But this is a book
It will be published this fall.

291
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,312
This fall?

292
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,158
Isn't that a little soon?

293
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,829
- I just feel...
- Leave the feeling to me.

294
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,950
- But the title: ''Prosopopeia''
- We've discussed that.

295
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,755
I like one-word titles myself:
<i>''Hunger'',</i> ''Underworld''...

296
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,793
- ''Prosopopeia'' is one word.
- He's right about that.

297
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,429
Your first book sets the tone
for your entire authorship.

298
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,594
Imagine a critic writing
a review of ''Prozac-and-pee.''

299
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,033
- I'm provoking you a little, but...
- I love the title.

300
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,632
There's something about
your thematic structure that...

301
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,598
It's interesting that you
know Phillip Reisnes.

302
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,158
Something about your book
reminded me of his.

303
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,719
Maybe you're right.
Thank you.

304
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,478
You and Reisnes...

305
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,190
How old are you? 23?

306
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,596
Fantastic!

307
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,393
A word to the wise:
Never listen to old farts like me.

308
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,952
No, no, no.
Remember what Wittgenstein says:

309
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,712
The important things in life are
expressed through music, not words.

310
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,438
I have something I need to do.

311
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,832
Excellent.

312
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,674
Have you read Ottar Tomte? We're marking
the release of his posthumous poetry.

313
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,112
- Lf you want to go.
- Sure. Thanks for the invitation.

314
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,156
- So?
- Who was friends with Ottar Tomte?

315
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,593
Who wrote the epilogue for his book
and will feel obliged to appear?

316
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,559
<i>Erik and Phllllp discovered</i>
<i>Sten Egil Dahl when they were 17.</i>

317
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,753
<i>They both spent all their lunch money</i>
<i>on books and records.</i>

318
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,519
<i>Sten Egil Dahl</i>
<i>wrote his first novel at age 20.</i>

319
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,839
<i>It was awarded the Nordlc</i>
<i>Council's Prize for Literature in 1964.</i>

320
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,637
<i>Unexpectedly, he dldn't</i>
<i>show up at the awards ceremony.</i>

321
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,158
<i>This relnforced his reputatlon as</i>
<i>solitary and detached from reallty.</i>

322
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:32,273
China considers it beautiful that
the North Vietnamese are bleeding!

323
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,109
My book has nothing to do
with Chinese politics!

324
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,834
I'm afraid the debate has to end here.

325
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,473
Thank you.

326
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,876
<i>Sten Egil Dahl moved to Paris,</i>
<i>where he wrote hls second novel.</i>

327
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,871
<i>He soon withdrew from publlc life.</i>

328
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,549
<i>Before returning to Norway,</i>
<i>he only had contact -

329
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,831
- <i>wlth recluslve author</i>
<i>Maurice Blanchot.</i>

330
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,793
<i>Llttle Is known</i>
<i>about Dahl after this.</i>

331
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,310
<i>He published a few books,</i>
<i>but remained a recluse.</i>

332
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,830
<i>He lived isolated in a house</i>
<i>by the Frogner Park.</i>

333
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,873
<i>Erik found</i> a <i>cryptic passage</i>
<i>in " Crystal'' -

334
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,310
- <i>where the Monollth statue,</i>
<i>observed from</i> a <i>window -

335
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,715
- was <i>described as a sundial.</i>

336
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,790
- That must be the house.
- Yes.

337
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,394
<i>Phllllp's first work was called</i>
<i>''Dust." Erik was impressed.</i>

338
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,835
<i>Erik's story took three months.</i>
<i>He claimed he wrote It in one night.</i>

339
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,635
It works better
if you remove the lens cap.

340
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,949
Listen, ''Rain <i>Man,''</i> have you been
out of the apartment yet?

341
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,390
- I went to the pharmacy yesterday.
- The pharmacy?

342
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,678
- So you'll go?
- I guess.

343
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,830
And dad says, ''Henning, give Geir
more space around the dinner <i>table.''</i>

344
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,114
I thought, ''ls he planning on
getting fatter? '' He was a chubby kid.

345
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,677
- No, I wasn't.
- You were our own Michelin Man.

346
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,036
- How much do you weigh now?
- 75.

347
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,718
Erik?

348
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,349
Johanne, from the publisher's.

349
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,597
Of course!
Good to see you again.

350
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,833
Feel free to join us.

351
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,194
Thanks.

352
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,470
- Johanne works with my publisher.
- Well I'm also working on my MA.

353
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,229
I was a big fan
of Erik's manuscript.

354
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,188
What is your master's thesis about?

355
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,757
I'll probably change it a bit.

356
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:04,353
But it's basically about contemporary
literature. The new Norwegian authors.

357
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,953
Anyway, things are more exciting
for you, with your upcoming release.

358
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,071
You're Phillip, right?

359
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,350
''Phantom <i>lmages''</i> is
one of my favourite books ever.

360
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,432
Particularly that long passage
toward the end.

361
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,319
Is that how you work now?

362
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,913
Phillip has been
a little tired lately.

363
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,834
But he's better now.
Right?

364
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,794
Soon you'll write
something awesome again.

365
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,030
- We had a meeting today.
- Sebastian. Hi.

366
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,751
A new cell phone ad campaign.

367
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,789
I like the edge.
It's quirky, it's weird. It works.

368
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,074
We made small talk, wondered if
we had any mutual acquaintances.

369
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,915
It turns out we did.

370
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,919
- Lars Henriksen?
- No. Lars Etterstad.

371
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,312
- Did he go to Berg High School?
- Yes.

372
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,036
Porno Lars?
They know Porno!

373
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,391
You guys know Porno Lars?

374
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,469
This consultant had lived
in that flat share with Lars.

375
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,918
Lars came home late one night.

376
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,550
He asked if Lars wanted a glass
of wine. But Lars answered:

377
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,069
I'm trying to cut back on TV.

378
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,239
He said he was going to read
his new Heidegger book.

379
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,598
But thanks for the offer.

380
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,240
Look at him. He has no idea
that he goes by the name of Porno Lars.

381
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,156
Careful, Lars. Too much Heidegger
can make you <i>dizzy.</i>

382
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,269
What's he saying?
I can't understand his dialect.

383
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,791
What's that tattoo? An ad?

384
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,952
''Oslo City Shopping <i>Centre''?</i>

385
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,152
- No, don't! I'm dry!
- Oh really?

386
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,398
So you're getting your master's?

387
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,279
Are you OK?

388
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,353
Sure. I just don't understand
your friends' humor.

389
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,788
What's Mathis Wergeland's
book called, Erik?

390
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,878
''That Which Ties Us <i>Down.''</i>
- Right.

391
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,790
That which Ties Us Down.
''Ties''...

392
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,515
- I liked Mathis' book.
- I figured.

393
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,431
If he had written in English,
he would be world famous by now.

394
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,996
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous? Me?

395
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,079
I knew him before he was famous
and he was a jerk even then.

396
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,432
Oh ''jerk'' was he. Well, not everyone
can become a famous author.

397
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,155
You do have a point. ''Jerk'' isn't
precise enough to describe him.

398
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,350
I wish Mathis would -

399
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,878
- choke on black cock in hell, that
politically correct fascist cunt.

400
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,069
No...

401
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,153
That's enough!

402
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,630
- He's just kidding.
- No I'm not.

403
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,196
I don't care, I've had it.
I hate people like him.

404
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,038
What you hate is war and George Bush
and the World Bank and such.

405
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,556
Who the hell do you think you are?

406
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,479
You are the most immature
people I have ever met!

407
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,470
Spreading nasty rumours about
each other... I feel sorry for you.

408
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,593
- And for him.
- Me? What are you talking about?

409
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,393
Why do you hang out with these people?

410
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,879
Sorry for me?

411
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,070
- What's she talking about?
- I've met guys like you before.

412
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,475
I just have one thing to say:

413
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:56,073
It can't be easy to
have problems in this crowd.

414
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,276
You're so cute when you're mad.

415
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,751
And you are incredibly banal!

416
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,869
She seemed nice.

417
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,436
Bye.

418
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,753
Hi.

419
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,474
- Hi, Erik!
- Hi.

420
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,668
- Long time no see.
- Isn't Lillian here?

421
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,195
No.

422
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,593
Does anyone want a drink?

423
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,313
- I think I'll wait.
- No, thanks.

424
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,156
- Have you seen Sten Egil Dahl?
- I doubt he'll show.

425
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,113
- But you and?
- I just wanted her to come.

426
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,350
Are you sure that's a good idea?

427
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,756
What does your psychiatrist say?

428
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,390
Is it a problem that Kari is here?

429
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,717
- I didn't mean it like that.

430
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,591
- How are you doing?
- Fine. So-so, I guess.

431
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,117
- Are you still at the university?
- No, I don't know

432
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,752
- I'm in telemarketing.
- How interesting.

433
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,635
No. It isn't.
Actually, it sucks.

434
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,231
I heard your book
is getting published.

435
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,358
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous about that.

436
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,671
There's Mathis Wergeland.

437
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,790
Please don't come over,
you superficial imbecile.

438
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,590
Shit.

439
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,394
Look at this!
Phillip Reisnes.

440
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,353
Long time no see.
Good to have you back.

441
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,357
Are you writing?

442
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,557
No, I'm... that is...

443
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,995
Hi.
Erik. Erik Hoiaas

444
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,396
This is Kari... Kari...

445
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,830
Kari-Kari? Nice to meet you.

446
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,551
I really believe in this guy.

447
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,234
See you around, all right?

448
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,553
I... I don't think...

449
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,792
I have to go.

450
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,520
Don't let him bother you.

451
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,359
I just don't feel well.

452
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,153
- I'm tired.
- What about Sten Egil Dahl?

453
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,316
Do you want to go home?

454
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,958
I can't do this. Sorry.

455
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,991
- This was a mistake.
- Don't worry about it.

456
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,240
It just isn't like it used to be.

457
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,389
I know it's important to Erik,
but I don't want to write anymore.

458
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,915
Having fun?

459
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,713
- Yes.
- Have you thought about your title?

460
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,957
- Yes, I've thought about it.
- Excellent.

461
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,079
I think ''Prosopopeia''
is a good title.

462
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,838
Don't you?

463
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,349
Don't ask me, tell me.

464
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,996
Say: The book's title is
''Prosopopeia'', dammit!

465
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,910
I'll remember that. Thanks.
We'll talk later.

466
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,031
Sten Egil Dahl?

467
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,197
My name is Erik Hoiaas.
I'm a big fan of your work.

468
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,074
- It's a great honour for me...
- Hey, Erik! Hi.

469
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,751
Mathis Wergeland.
I'm a big fan of yours.

470
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,112
Well <i>''fan''</i> is a little teenage,
but ''admirer'' is so formal.

471
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,871
<i>''Crystal''</i> is just amazing.

472
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,873
Your opening chapter there...

473
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,390
There's this...

474
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,875
This...

475
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,390
- Don't you agree?
- Absolutely.

476
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,308
- Do you write as well?
- Yes, I have written a book.

477
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,316
You probably haven't read it.

478
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,789
It hasn't been published yet.

479
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,869
- Then I probably haven't read it.
- But it will be published.

480
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,790
Excuse me,
I was on my way home.

481
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,229
But your book has been accepted?

482
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:49,833
<i>Erik knew that in S. E. Dahl's mind, he</i>
<i>and Mathls were now indlstinguishable.</i>

483
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,239
Phillip?

484
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,072
What's wrong?

485
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,272
I just don't feel...

486
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,996
I couldn't sleep... and...

487
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,990
It helps to turn up the volume.

488
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,752
I took a little too much Seroquel

489
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,791
I couldn't sleep!

490
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,556
You're taking your medication?

491
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,750
Did something happen
between you and Kari?

492
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,838
Don't baby-sit me.
I need time to myself.

493
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,915
No problem.

494
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,039
Hello?

495
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,113
Hi.

496
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,233
Why did you buy me a plane ticket?

497
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,472
Did you look at the date?

498
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,155
The exact same date

499
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,753
as the last time we went.

500
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,951
You can't just assume that

501
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,152
I can, or want to, go to Paris.

502
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,316
No pressure.

503
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,155
But can you at least consider it?

504
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,675
Lars mentioned that Phillip
and Kari were going to Paris again.

505
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,877
Erik pretended that Phillip
had already told him.

506
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,033
He studied chemistry. Was brilliant.
The best in his class.

507
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,631
He got headhunted to some
pharmaceutical company in the USA.

508
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,592
But his girlfriend couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship.

509
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,955
She got depressed. Said
she couldn't function without him.

510
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,400
So he quit his job
and moved back home.

511
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,640
After a few weeks, she dumped him.
Didn't really love him anymore.

512
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,356
He was unable to go back to work.
Now he lives with his mom.

513
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,709
You live with your mom, don't you?

514
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,158
Hi, Lillian!

515
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,231
She's probably frigid.
Any girl that pretty is.

516
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,239
- You would know, who's cilibate.
- Cilibate?

517
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,232
- You mean celibate.

518
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,628
- Right, cilibate.

519
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,878
Maybe cilibate is how farmers say it,
but in civilization we say -

520
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,555
- celibate with an e
- You know what I meant.

521
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,319
Tonight?

522
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,712
I don't know. I have to try
to write while Phillip is away.

523
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,039
Thank you.

524
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,313
You're so cool!

525
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,197
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.

526
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,756
It's so embarrassing.

527
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,874
Anyway, my point is
that you need to get laid.

528
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,075
- Why don't you go see Lillian?
- I thought maybe we could...

529
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,952
- I can get laid whenever I want.
- With that Hitler Youth haircut?

530
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,069
I'm out of here.
Bye.

531
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,912
Bye!

532
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,870
- We were on the 4th floor last time.
- This room is nice.

533
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,432
- We had a nice time?
- Absolutely.

534
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,190
I may have been a little nervous.

535
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,273
- How did I seem to you?

536
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,480
- You seemed happy.

537
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,198
What did we do the next day?

538
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,556
We sat at a café
and talked for ages.

539
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,478
- What was the weather like?
- Raining, I think.

540
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:21,956
- What did we talk about?
- Everything. I can't remember.

541
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,310
But it was nice.

542
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,759
What was I like?
Was I happy?

543
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,515
- Don't you remember?
- Sure.

544
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,997
I'm glad you came.

545
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,996
You were thinking about Rune.

546
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,992
I decided I had to make you
fall in love with me.

547
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,516
- You were unsure of your feelings.
- No, I wasn't.

548
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,112
Sure you were.

549
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:06,078
Anyway, it worked.
It worked because I told you first.

550
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,313
''When I reach zero,
you'll fall in love with <i>me.''</i>

551
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,475
Ten.

552
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,473
Nine.

553
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,793
Eight.

554
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,077
What are you doing?

555
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,352
Seven, six...

556
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,639
Five.

557
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,759
Four.

558
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,953
Three.

559
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,194
Two.

560
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,438
One.

561
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,193
Zero.

562
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:31,517
You must have sat and slid down.
Your skirt had been pulled up.

563
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,956
Don't worry.
You looked incredible.

564
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,508
- It feels stupid.
- Don't worry about that.

565
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,837
- Can't we...
- Come on!

566
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,193
Come on.

567
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,470
Look to the left.

568
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,352
A little down.

569
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,511
Gather your legs.

570
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,318
It's uncomfortable.

571
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,188
- We had sex the second night.
- They know what <i>''sex''</i> means.

572
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,712
No they don't. It's just
strange noises to them.

573
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,829
The French don't even understand
English without a French accent.

574
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,749
I don't think
it was until the third night.

575
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,839
- Why was I so nervous?
- You were so cute.

576
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,232
You kept talking about
how the first time never is any good.

577
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,119
No, wait.

578
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,751
What's the matter?

579
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,310
What are you thinking about?

580
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,193
Nothing.

581
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,156
Say something.

582
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,273
Why did you want us
to come back here?

583
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,953
You don't love me anymore,
is that it?

584
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,231
I don't know.

585
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,628
Of course you know.

586
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,518
FALL

587
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,510
Erik Hoiaas is here.
Your book has just been published.

588
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,279
''Pro-so-po-peia.''

589
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:39,433
You write about madness. Do you
have a personal connection to that?

590
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:44,989
Well... ''Prosopopeia'', isn't really...

591
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,271
It isn't really about madness.

592
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,958
The personal is on a different
level than the biographical.

593
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,152
But the protagonist is searching
for ''the absolute language.''

594
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,675
A language which can grasp
all the world's nuances.

595
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,157
And that is a madness of sorts.

596
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:15,075
A strong personal experience
can become an intense story.

597
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,953
But what I meant to say...

598
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:25,038
Giving details of personal suffering
has become a tabloid requirement.

599
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,909
Bringing up
all sorts of personal <i>''tragedies.''</i>

600
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,832
But that's not real ''literature'' is it?

601
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,274
John Pedersen,
you became an author late in life.

602
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,749
Your story
is titled ''The Long Journey <i>Back.''</i>

603
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:51,239
I never thought I would become
an author. But when things...

604
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,435
- Hi, Phillip.
- Hi, Erik Hoiaas, long time no see.

605
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,711
- How's it going?
- I'm not really sure.

606
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,230
I don't know if you saw me on TV.
It didn't go well.

607
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,790
Forget about that. Come on over.
Geir and Morten are here.

608
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,397
It's been a while.

609
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,550
I don't know.
I'm going to Lillian's.

610
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,317
So nothing's changed there?

611
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,632
Then bring her with you.

612
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,671
We've been invited
to a party at Lars'.

613
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:42,274
<i>Two months earller Lars felt obliged to</i>
<i>mingle with his fellow med- students.</i>

614
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,592
<i>No one had heard from hlm since.</i>

615
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,238
<i>That night Lars had mlngled qulte</i>
<i>a lot with a glrl: Merethe.</i>

616
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,673
Does Lars have a girlfriend?

617
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,710
My God!

618
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,440
Then we have no choice.

619
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,873
OK.

620
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,392
<i>Lllllan was understanding</i>
<i>as always when Erik sald:</i>

621
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,794
Phillip rang.
He doesn't feel well.

622
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,636
21? This must be it.

623
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,559
Hey...

624
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,354
I can't take it.
It's too sad.

625
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,551
- Hey there.
- Hey. Well... quite a party!

626
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,714
And <i>Little Lord Fauntleroyl</i>
Out svimming with commoners?

627
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,037
We were about to leave,
but now things are picking up.

628
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,195
- I brought my friend Johanne.
- Nice to meet you.

629
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,520
Come on in.

630
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,958
Sorry.

631
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,232
Are you all right?

632
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,678
Do you know Bjorn?

633
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,994
Yes.

634
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,394
- What's your name?
- Geir.

635
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,236
Hi, Geir

636
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,475
Ingrid?

637
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,719
Ingrid!

638
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,032
We've had another complaint.
Can you please...

639
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,714
Henning!

640
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,629
Choke on black cock in hell,
you politically correct fascist cunt!

641
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,112
Get some sleep.

642
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,719
Bye.

643
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,394
Five.

644
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,953
Four.

645
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,354
Three.

646
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,595
Two.

647
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,319
One.

648
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,429
Zero.

649
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,596
Ten.

650
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,995
Nine.

651
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,317
Eight, seven, six, five...

652
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,514
Four, three, two, one...

653
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,958
Lillian?

654
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,679
Hi.

655
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,515
- How nice.
- Not a word, Erik.

656
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,632
Don't touch me.

657
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,673
Lillian...
Hey, come sit down.

658
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,998
I've had enough. Not just because
we never see each other.

659
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:46,320
It's that you pretend to care,
when you're so damn selfish.

660
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,639
You're such a damn cliché!

661
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,717
Don't call me.

662
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,676
Is he awake?

663
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,872
So you've seen it?

664
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,076
FORM WITHOUT SUBSTANCE.

665
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:42,032
Want a cup of tea?

666
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,311
Hi, Phillip.

667
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,036
No, I'm a little...

668
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,429
What?
You've written something?

669
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,998
Well...

670
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,393
This is...

671
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,714
A lot of it is good, but we've
always been honest with each other.

672
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,115
This isn't your best work.

673
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,195
But it's cool
that you're writing.

674
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,236
What?

675
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,149
I'm glad you take it like that.

676
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,393
It just seems... disjointed.
Even for me who knows your style.

677
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,038
I mean, you haven't
slept all night.

678
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:29,757
But there is something here.

679
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,597
Your water metaphor
relating to emotional distance, -

680
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,954
- but then that glides into
this erotic thing...

681
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,557
There's a lot here you can work on.

682
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,630
I don't think so.

683
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,310
- It's only the first draft.
Don't try to be nice.

684
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,150
I'm not being nice. If you work on it
this might be publishable.

685
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,078
That isn't important.
I'm just writing for myself.

686
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,953
- A lot of this is good.
- No, it isn't!

687
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,991
Why can you never say what you mean?

688
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,873
I mean... You're a great writer.

689
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:27,315
All I've ever done is to recycle
Sten Egil Dahl and Tor Ulven.

690
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,355
It's no big deal.

691
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,318
- Is that recycled Sten Egil Dahl too?
- I don't know.

692
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,990
What do you mean?

693
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,478
- What the fuck are you doing?
- He's mine.

694
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,034
- Svein?
- Sorry, Erik.

695
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,357
I'm not a homo!

696
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,559
You're Erik Hoiaas, aren't you?

697
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,997
- Yes.
- I saw you on TV last night.

698
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:43,551
- Let me get you to a doctor.
- No, I'm fine.

699
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:47,112
TV is no place to discuss literature.

700
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,711
I don't know why...

701
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,796
I've read your book.

702
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,272
Great title.

703
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,238
Very good.

704
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,909
Except for the final part.

705
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,357
Don't try to be poetic.

706
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,636
- Are you serious?
- Yes. But the rest was good.

707
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,911
Very promising.

708
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,993
You...

709
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,669
You look much better now.

710
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,789
How do you feel?

711
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,831
Much better.
Much better.

712
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,349
<i>An idea had begun to take shape.</i>

713

Hello, my name is Kari Brekke.
May I speak to Linda Saugstad?

727
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,315
- Hello, my name is...
- Kari?

728
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,517
I found you.
I managed to find you.

729
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,391
You know where I work.

730
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,431
It was always meant to be.
There were just so many things...

731
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,916
Something links us together.
I found you here, right?

732
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,715
Everything was a mess.

733
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,280
There was something that...

734
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,516
Excuse me.

735
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,517
Can I help you?

736
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,152
- Listen to me.
- Kari?

737
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:16,752
I love you, Kari.
Everything is in synch now.

738
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,956
I love you.
I love you.

739
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,878
Stop it!

740
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,951
I can't take this anymore...

741
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,471
Phillip, hey...

742
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,159
Hey...

743
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,913
Phillip?

744
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,116
- Kari?
- Just...

745
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,436
Come on.

746
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,518
Get up.

747
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,795
<i>Erik would have left without saying</i>
<i>goodbye to Phillip or his friends.</i>

748
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,152
<i>He would have found a small</i>
<i>apartment where he could write.</i>

749
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,237
<i>Erik would have let nothing interfere</i>
<i>wlth his creative impulses.</i>

750
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,754
<i>Paradoxically, missing friends</i>
<i>and family would have inspired him.</i>

751
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:32,555
<i>After months of hard work,</i>
<i>he would've completed his novel.</i>

752
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:37,072
<i>The next fall Erik's second book</i>
<i>would be published In Norway.</i>

753
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,831
<i>The book would've gotten mixed reviews</i>
<i>and sparked</i> a <i>llterary debate</i>

754
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,555
- <i>a professor from Denmark</i>
<i>would say in an article.</i>

755
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:52,755
Norway now has two authors of interest:
Sten Egil Dahl and Erik Hoiaas.

756
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:58,557
<i>Erik would feel distanced from</i>
<i>this fuss, worklng on his new book.</i>

757
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:04,232
<i>Surprisingly, it was a first novel that</i>
<i>was the big hit that fall.</i>

758
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,352
<i>A coming of age, Oslo epic:</i> Roundabout

759
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,510
It's an attack on the World Bank,
the North-South conflict.

760
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:19,637
- That may not be obvious to everyone.
- No, but all the more important.

761
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,398
Buy it, it's important!

762
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,432
<i>After</i> a <i>year abroad, Erik would have</i>
<i>felt It was time to come home.</i>

763
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,231
<i>They would have met again at</i> a <i>café.</i>
<i>Or at a restaurant....</i>

764
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,315
<i>No, It would have been at a wedding.</i>

765
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,433
Kari is cool.

766
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:22,869
She's my nurse. Makes sure
I take my medicine, get dressed, -

767
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,558
- gives me sponge baths...

768
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,394
Nah, actually, we're pretty happy.

769
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:39,271
You all have girlfriends.
Traitors!

770
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,517
You didn't give us a choice,
running off like that.

01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,159
- I'm back at the university.

773
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,919
- Studying what?

774
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:59,068
It may seem stupid,
but I'm studying psychology.

775
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,798
That's great!

776
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:05,117
<i>Erik would've feared she thought</i>
<i>he was ironic.</i>

777
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,676
<i>He truly thought it was</i>
<i>a touchlng expresslon of</i> love.

778
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,231
- He killed himself?
- Yes.

779
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,915
- I thought you knew.
- No.

780
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,432
A few months ago.

781
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,110
Does anyone know why?

782
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,629
Well, he only had two fans.

783
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:33,914
One went nuts, the other fled
the country. That was the straw...

784
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,592
No, I don't know.

785
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:43,552
This next song is dedicated to
my brother Geir, the politician.

786
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,718
Let's hope he doesn't get
''Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister''!

787
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,634
<i>The next day Phillip would have told</i>
<i>Erik how much he liked his book.</i>

788
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,475
<i>They would've discussed</i>
<i>S. E. Dahl's sulcide,</i>

789
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,274
- <i>before Phillip</i>
<i>sald he had run into Svein.</i>

790
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:54,035
- He seemed upset about hurting you.
- Me?

791
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:58,952
<i>Phllllp's comments would inspire</i>
<i>Erik to keep working on his next novel.</i>

792
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,238
How about you?
Aren't you going to write?

793
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,069
No, I don't think so.

794
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:19,630
Though maybe the spirit will
move me again, like last time.

795
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,871
- Ten, nine...
- Stop it.

796
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,675
Eight, seven, six, five...

797
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,913
Four.

798
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,799
Three.

799
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,839
Two.

800
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,470
One.

801
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,113
Stop (The End)
