1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,669
So...
Are we going to get something published?

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,030
...Or do you just want to
stand here cultivating your angst?

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,833
- There's a reason we're standing here.
- What do you mean?

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,475
- You're the one who stopped.

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,479
- Sure, but I can start walking again.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,633
Do I really want to
expose the world to this?

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,352
Let's just do it.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,440
This is when it all begins.

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,869
<i>Their manuscripts</i>
<i>would have been accepted immediately.</i>

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,989
<i>They would've been published the next fall.</i>

11
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,669
<i>Finally they would've been authors.</i>

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,194
<i>Their books would have sold poorly.</i>
<i>Erik and Phillip couldn't care less.</i>

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,317
<i>More importantly, the books' enigmatic</i>
<i>nature would've made them cult classics</i>

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,158
<i>Phillip would've been</i>
<i>overwhelmed by his success.</i>

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,593
<i>In a burst of hubris he'd declare</i>
<i>his literary project completed and...</i>

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,156
<i>No, it would've been love that caused</i>
<i>Phillip to lose faith in literature.</i>

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,518
<i>He would have left Oslo</i>
<i>without telling a soul.</i>

18
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,830
<i>After three months</i>
<i>he would've reached the Vézére-valley.</i>

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,870
<i>The sight of the Lascaux paintings</i>
<i>would've provoked a delirious fit.</i>

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,389
<i>Believing he knew Japanese, -</i>

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,398
<i>- he'd follow a tourist group</i>
<i>from Hiroshima an entire day, -</i>

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,559
<i>- before collapsing.</i>
<i>Diagnosis: Acute Stendhal Syndrome.</i>

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,478
<i>The urge to write</i>
<i>would again have resurfaced.</i>

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,677
<i>January. Oslo.</i>

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,718
<i>The loss of Phillip</i>
<i>would've become a loss of inspiration.</i>

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,952
<i>The writer's block was a fact.</i>

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,393
<i>Author Sten Egil Dahl would have</i>
<i>convinced Erik to go abroad to write.</i>

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,399
<i>She was a French publisher's daughter.</i>
<i>Her father had idealized her, -</i>

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,355
<i>- causing a deep inferiority complex,</i>
<i>both physical and intellectual.</i>

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,315
<i>On October 24 she would have</i>
<i>thrown herself from their balcony.</i>

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,274
<i>Her letter would've suggested it was</i>
<i>their happiness she couldn't deal with.</i>

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,473
<i>Erik would've felt ashamed by the</i>
<i>creativity triggered by her death.</i>

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,198
<i>They would have met</i>
<i>by chance at a café...</i>

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,357
<i>No, on the street.</i>

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,715
<i>On the Metro...</i>
<i>...at an airport...</i>

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,152
<i>No, in the Luxembourg Garden.</i>

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,071
<i>They would have realized</i>
<i>they were both writing the same book.</i>

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,717
<i>The book would've triggered a revolution</i>
<i>in East Africa, -</i>

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,912
<i>- been banned by the Vatican</i>,
<i>disillusioned the Dalai Lama, -</i>

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,998
<i>- and shaped the sexuality of Frode -</i>

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,792
<i>- a Twelve year old son of a pastry chef -</i>

42
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,878
<i>- who would've happened to read...</i>

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,512
This is when it all begins.

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,233
We have to get out of this country.

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,028
<i>Erik was relieved when his</i>
<i>suspicions were finally confirmed.</i>

46
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,315
<i>He was utterly without talent.</i>

47
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,679
<i>Phillip's manuscript was accepted.</i>
<i>His book was released in the fall.</i>

48
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,794
Hi.

49
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,996
SIX MONTHS LATER

50
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,276
These are great CDs.
Chris De Burgh, Sissel Kyrkjebø, -

51
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,075
- Pan Pipe Moods?
- Those are dad's old CDs.

52
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,394
- They came with the car.
- Came with the car?

53
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,832
Air condition and Pan Pipe Moods
is standard equipment in a Volvo?

54
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,759
Hi.

55
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,192
- Is that everything?
- I think so.

56
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,096
Thanks.

57
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,519
It'll be nice to come home
to your apartment, your PC...

58
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,793
Maybe you can start writing again.

59
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,518
- Do you have any music we can play?
- Eh... No.

60
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,029
Did you get hold of
any good drugs, Phillip?

61
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,870
I actually talked to a doctor who...

62
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,999
They said
down at the hospital that...

63
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,793
That more people
get addicted to...

64
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,549
- I'm sorry,
but right now you sound like Geir.

65
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,553
Shit...

66
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,552
Nice friends.

67
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,670
Geir...

68
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,833
Could we drop by Bygdøy?

69
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,958
Isn't it a little too cold for that?

70
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,349
<i>The punk band "Kommune" played their</i>
<i>farewell concert on Dec. 27, 1999.</i>

71
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,790
Next song:
"Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister."

72
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>Morten, a diehard fan, missed</i>
<i>his train and had to bike 50 km.</i>

73
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,631
<i>After 12 minutes,</i>
<i>he got a knee in his eye.</i>

74
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
<i>His first encounter</i>
<i>with Phillip and the others.</i>

75
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,550
<i>Ironic punk quickly evolved</i>
<i>into cynical commercialism:</i>

76
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,989
<i>Henning started an ad agency.</i>

77
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,472
This is... Katinka.

78
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,554
<i>Morten quit college to work for</i>
<i>Henning as a "creative" consultant.</i>

79
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,996
She's discussing ads in public spaces.

80
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,076
I'm just trying to get her to bed.

81
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,629
Hi, Lillian.

82
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,356
<i>Erik kept his girlfriend</i>
<i>at a safe distance from his friends.</i>

83
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,392
Tonight?
I don't know.

84
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,400
<i>Morten asked Geir what she was like. -</i>

85
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,039
<i>Geir said she was "Intelligent."</i>

86
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,473
<i>Morten therefore assumed she was</i>
<i>ugly. Geir pretended to agree.</i>

87
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,957
<i>A drunk Geir had once told Erik</i>
<i>he feared they were friends with him -</i>

88
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,071
<i>- just because his brother</i>
<i>was in the band.</i>

89
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,591
<i>Erik then had to wait two days</i>
<i>before asking him for free tickets.</i>

90
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,278
- What does that mean?

91
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,833
"Que le tout"?

92
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,838
Phillip, please turn
it down a little.

93
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,912
Violins are nice. but...

94
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,277
"The only thing left,
is everything."

95
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,278
"The whole."

96
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,154
- Hi, Phillip!
- Hi, mom.

97
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,353
Hi.

98
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,398
- How is it going?
- Fine, I think.

99
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,598
- Was the drive OK?
- Yes.

100
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,557
- Not too much traffic?
- No, we stopped at Bygdøy.

101
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,398
Have you removed my things?

102
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,710
Well, I had to tidy up a bit.

103
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,712
- Where are the pictures of Kari?
- We talked about this.

104
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,311
- You just took them down?
- It's for your own good.

105
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,560
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Maybe I forgot. The doctor...

106
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,238
Give me my keys, mom.

107
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,834
It's only practical
that someone has a spare set.

108
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,351
Hey...

109
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,551
Maybe you should take the keys.

110
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,117
Think about it. You'll probably
write something incredible now.

111
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,315
- How's your writing going?
- To hell.

112
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,274
I've reworked
that last one I sent in.

113
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,632
Think you could take a look at it?

114
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,190
You should just send it in.
I'm sure it's excellent.

115
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,238
Should we head home?

116
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,631
Am I tired already?

117
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,909
Sales is about desire,
commitment, knowledge...

118
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,828
Good, Fhaisal.
But you forget one key point:

119
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,034
You can't sell over the phone, until
you have learned to sell yourself.

120
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,592
You should leave modesty at the door
before entering here.

121
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,152
Oops! It just got run over
by a steamroller.

122
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,595
Throw the ball to someone, Fhaisal.

123
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,998
OK, who are you?

124
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,998
- Kari.
- Who are you?

125
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,714
Kari.

126
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,990
<i>Kari grew up on the east side of town -</i>

127
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,270
<i>- Phillip on the west.</i>

128
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,192
<i>Still Phillip insisted he had seen</i>
<i>her before: Constitution Day, 1989 -</i>

129
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,835
<i>- when he'd gotten lost and ended</i>
<i>up marching with the wrong school.</i>

130
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,357
<i>Kari didn't believe him,</i>
<i>but liked the idea.</i>

131
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,679
<i>At Eighteen Kari met Rune,</i>
<i>the former guitarist in "Kommune", -</i>

132
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,072
<i>- now frontman in "Mondo Topless", -</i>

133
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,796
<i>- incidentally the lamest use of a Russ</i>
<i>Meyer film title as a band name ever.</i>

134
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,793
<i>Fucking hippies!</i>

135
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,474
<i>After dating Rune for three years,</i>
<i>Kari started noticing Phillip.</i>

136
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,709
<i>She thought he was cute,</i>
<i>but was sure he was gay.</i>

137
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,637
<i>She asked Rune who they were:</i>

138
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,753
Just some spoiled rich kids
from the West Side.

139
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,757
I heard one of them
wrote this weird book.

140
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,871
<i>Phillip later told Kari he knew</i>
<i>they were destined for each other.</i>

141
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,954
<i>In ten seconds</i>
<i>she will look at him.</i>

142
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,239
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five,

143
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,350
four.

144
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,469
three.

145
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,715
two.

146
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,314
one.

147
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,277
<i>The next day</i>
<i>he invited her to Paris.</i>

148
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,116
<i>Phillip's sarcastic humor</i>
<i>made her snort with laughter.</i>

149
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,800
<i>Phillip said</i>
<i>her snorting was repulsive.</i>

150
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,594
<i>The word 'repulsive' made her laugh more.</i>
<i>His gaze made her feel pretty.</i>

151
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,188
<i>Phillip loved her parodies</i>
<i>of "sexy" girls in music videos.</i>

152
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,598
<i>She was the only girl he had met who</i>
<i>had Ramones' "Road to Ruin" on vinyl.</i>

153
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,712
<i>He enjoyed that they both</i>
<i>admitted actually disliking the Clash.</i>

154
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,154
Are you OK?

155
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,159
I'm fine.

156
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,429
- Hi.
- It's amazing.

157
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,358
This is incredible.

158
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,358
In the subway...
I didn't see the sign...

159
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,109
I sat down, and she said I...
shouldn't... It was painted...

160
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,357
But there wasn't any paint...

161
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,391
You have paint on your jacket.
There's paint all over your back.

162
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,157
No, there isn't.

163
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,430
- There was something... Fuck.
- Phillip, what's wrong?

164
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,110
It's just... I... I...

165
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,675
It wasn't by chance.

166
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,636
It's no coincidence that we met.

167
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,277
<i>The doctors said his obsessive romance</i>
<i>with Kari had triggered his psychosis.</i>

168
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,749
<i>When Phillip was committed,</i>
<i>Kari was advised not to visit him.</i>

169
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,958
Hi.

170
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,548
I let myself in.
Where have you been?

171
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,711
- I kept trying the doorbell.
- I just went to the store.

172
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,233
- I'm fine. Don't worry.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

173
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,590
I just wanted to show you this.

174
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,392
They accepted it. They're
going to publish "Prosopopeia."

175
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,717
That's great!

176
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,870
- Have you told Lillian yet?
- No.

177
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,558
A good book cover is important.

178
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,551
Didn't you say that if
your book was accepted, you would...

179
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,398
What do you mean?

180
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,072
- I have to break up with Lillian.
- You don't have to.

181
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,990
Yes, I do.

182
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,274
We've been going out for three years.

183
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,278
I can't waste any more time.

184
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,034
We can't have girlfriends now.

185
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,038
We're supposed to write and read...

186
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,116
- and hang out with friends.

187
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,032
And if we feel the urge, -

188
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,315
- we'll practice deviant,
fetishistic sex with prostitutes.

189
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,996
You can practice deviant
fetishistic sex with Lillian.

190
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,313
That...

191
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,119
No.

192
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,670
I have to break up with her.

193
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,195
I can't stay with her
just to be nice.

194
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,078
Not that she's terrible to be with.
She's actually pretty cool.

195
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,796
Girls just aren't cool. - Sorry.
They can be pretty, or "cute" and -

196
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,673
- with some "constructive" diet-pressure,
maybe even sexy.

197
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,715
They can be nice. Dumb, but nice.
But who wants "nice"?

198
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,753
You want interesting people around you.

199
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,877
Has a girl ever introduced you to
any new music -

200
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,915
- or recommended a book you
didn't already read in high-school?

201
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,270
Anything just slightly
outside the mainstream?

202
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,073
If so, she got it from an ex,
her brother, her father.

203
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,839
They just pretend they've discovered it.

204
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,838
It's worse here. On the East Side
they know they're "underprivileged."

205
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,399
Over here they've been raised
to "have an opinion."

206
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,474
And intrude on adult conversations.

207
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,629
- Hi.
- Hi, Lillian, it's me.

208
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,189
Guys in long-term relationships
become so lame.

209
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,512
They get sucked into this feminine
sphere of TV-series and nice dinners.

210
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,355
They get less and less time
to read and listen to music.

211
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,516
Eventually they don't even miss it.

212
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,909
They end up as
understimulated, bourgeois retards.

213
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,630
Hi!

214
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,552
<i>If he broke up now, Lillian would</i>
<i>think it's because of the novel.</i>

215
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,151
<i>He'd be a phoney</i>
<i>who dumps girls once he succeeds.</i>

216
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:12,435
<i>She'd think she wasn't good enough</i>
<i>for him. Which wasn't entirely true.</i>

217
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,476
<i>And what about all his things? It</i>
<i>would seem cynical to take them now.</i>

218
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,956
<i>But picking them up later</i>
<i>would definitely be wrong...</i>

219
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,071
What's the matter?

220
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,439
Erik, come here a second.

221
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,672
I don't mind you using my PC at all.

222
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,873
But I don't appreciate that -

223
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,554
- things like this pop up,
when I turn it on.

224
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,594
Is this what you look at?
Feel free to talk to me about it.

225
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,037
But what if that girl was me?

226
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,791
<i>What if she can't take it?</i>
<i>That may be conceited of him, but...</i>

227
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,038
Bullshit.

228
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,196
Feeling guilty is slave mentality.

229
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,915
Sometimes you have to
be Zarathustra. Be mean.

230
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,877
I have to tell you...

231
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,316
<i>Suddenly Erik remembered</i>
<i>the last time he'd been "mean."</i>

232
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,000
<i>Erik and Phillip were in 2nd grade.</i>

233
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,677
<i>Phillip had</i>
<i>another best friend:</i>

234
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,556
<i>Erik heard Svein talk</i>
<i>about Phillip to a 6th grader.</i>

235
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,998
You two hang out a lot.
Are you gay, or what?

236
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,112
No, but maybe he is.

237
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,472
<i>Having had a liberal upbringing, Erik</i>
<i>had always defended society's outcasts.</i>

238
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,115
<i>But this time he told everybody</i>
<i>that Svein said Phillip was gay.</i>

239
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,638
<i>Erik's mother heard this from</i>
<i>a classmate and Erik's teacher.</i>

240
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,593
He used "gay" as a term of abuse?

241
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,752
His father is reactionary, but...

242
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,190
<i>An emergency meeting was called.</i>

243
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,190
<i>Svein left the school shortly after.</i>

244
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,550
<i>Years later Svein was seen -</i>

245
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,990
<i>- cutting in line at a liquor store</i>,
<i>pushing a baby carriage.</i>

246
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,072
- My novel was accepted.
- That's great!

247
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,550
Are you still at the university?

248
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,271
I don't know.
It's kind of complicated.

249
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,279
I've considered
studying sociology again.

250
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,994
No... I don't know.

251
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,839
I'm working at the moment.

252
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,553
Hi.

253
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,010
I'm going to get a coffee.

254
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,751
How long has it been?

255
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,875
Seven months.

256
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,511
I can't believe
we're sitting here like this.

257
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,594
Yes...

258
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,710
Remember when I tricked you
into falling in love, in Paris?

259
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,515
- I was already in love with you.
- No, you weren't.

260
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,313
You were still into
that "rock star", weren't you?

261
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,756
Poor Rune.

262
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,153
No.

263
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,960
But we had a nice time, didn't we.

264
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,918
In Paris.

265
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,153
Were you in love with me then?

266
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,075
Yes. I was.

267
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,555
I wasn't sick back then.

268
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,912
I wasn't.

269
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,911
- You've put your hair up.
- Yes.

270
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,350
- I like it.
- No, you don't

271
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,469
I do.
It's just different.

272
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,478
You look nice.

273
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,991
I felt a lot worse afterwards.

274
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,828
I didn't understand anything.

275
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,597
I wanted to call.

276
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,072
But they told me
that wasn't a good idea.

277
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,155
And I didn't know...

278
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,757
- I didn't know how you felt about me.
- That must have been hard.

279
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,000
I wish we could just...

280
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,515
Meet all over again.

281
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,358
Forget everything.

282
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,518
Bye.

283
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,272
I must admit.
After reading this I thought:

284
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,517
"He must be some eccentric,
old-before-his-time type."

285
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,471
No offense.

286
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,077
And then you show up.
Look at him!

287
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,795
I mean, he's handsome.
A good-looking boy.

288
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,633
- So what happens now?
- Certain parts will be reworked.

289
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,431
And it needs to be proofread.

290
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,438
But this is a book
It will be published this fall.

291
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,352
This fall?

292
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,198
Isn't that a little soon?

293
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,869
- I just feel...
- Leave the feeling to me.

294
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,990
- But the title: "Prosopopeia"
- We've discussed that.

295
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,795
I like one-word titles myself:
"Hunger", "Underworld"...

296
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,833
- "Prosopopeia" is one word.
- He's right about that.

297
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,469
Your first book sets the tone
for your entire authorship.

298
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,634
Imagine a critic writing
a review of "Prozac-and-pee."

299
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,073
- I'm provoking you a little, but...
- I love the title.

300
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,672
There's something about
your thematic structure that...

301
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,638
It's interesting that you
know Phillip Reisnes.

302
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,198
Something about your book
reminded me of his.

303
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,759
Maybe you're right.
Thank you.

304
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,518
You and Reisnes...

305
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,230
How old are you? 23?

306
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,000
Fantastic!

307
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,433
A word to the wise:
Never listen to old farts like me.

308
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,992
No, no, no.
Remember what Wittgenstein says:

309
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,752
"The important things in life are
expressed through music, not words."

310
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,478
I have something I need to do.

311
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,872
Excellent.

312
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,714
Have you read Ottar Tømte? We're marking
the release of his posthumous poetry.

313
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,152
- If you want to go.
- Sure. Thanks for the invitation.

314
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,196
- So?
- Who was friends with Ottar Tømte?

315
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,633
Who wrote the epilogue for his book
and will feel obliged to appear?

316
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,599
<i>Erik and Phillip discovered</i>
<i>Sten Egil Dahl when they were 17.</i>

317
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,793
<i>They both spent all their lunch money</i>
<i>on books and records.</i>

318
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,559
<i>Sten Egil Dahl</i>
<i>wrote his first novel at age 20.</i>

319
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,879
<i>It was awarded the Norwegian</i>
<i>Culture Award for Literature in 1964.</i>

320
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,677
<i>Unexpectedly, he didn't</i>
<i>show up at the awards ceremony.</i>

321
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,198
<i>This reinforced his reputation as</i>
<i>solitary and detached from reality.</i>

322
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:31,313
China considers it beautiful that
the North Vietnamese are bleeding!

323
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,149
My book has nothing to do
with Chinese politics!

324
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,874
I'm afraid the debate has to end here.

325
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,513
Thank you.

326
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,916
<i>Sten Egil Dahl moved to Paris,</i>
<i>where he wrote his second novel.</i>

327
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,911
<i>He soon withdrew from public life.</i>

328
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,589
<i>Before returning to Norway,</i>
<i>he only had contact -</i>

329
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,871
<i>- with reclusive author</i>
<i>Maurice Blanchot.</i>

330
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,833
<i>Little is known</i>
<i>about Dahl after this.</i>

331
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,350
<i>He published a few books</i>,
<i>but remained a recluse.</i>

332
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,870
<i>He lived isolated in a house</i>
<i>by the Frogner Park.</i>

333
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,913
<i>Erik found a cryptic passage</i>
<i>in "Crystal" -</i>

334
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,350
<i>- where the Monolith statue,</i>
<i>observed from a window -</i>

335
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,755
<i>- was described as a sundial.</i>

336
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,830
- That must be the house.
- Yes.

337
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,434
<i>Phillip's first work was called "Dust."</i>
<i>Erik was impressed.</i>

338
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,875
<i>Erik's story took three months.</i>
<i>He claimed he wrote it "during the night."</i>

339
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,675
It works better
if you remove the lens cap.

340
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,989
Listen, "Rain Man", have you been
out of the apartment yet?

341
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,430
- I went to the pharmacy yesterday.
- The pharmacy?

342
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,718
- So you'll go?
- I guess.

343
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,870
And dad says, "Henning, give Geir
more space around the dinner table."

344
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,154
I thought, "Is he planning on
getting fatter?" He was a chubby kid.

345
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,717
- No, I wasn't.
- You were our own Michelin Man.

346
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,076
- How much do you weigh now?
- 75.

347
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,758
Erik?

348
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,389
Johanne, from the publisher's.

349
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,637
Of course!
Good to see you again.

350
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,873
Feel free to join us.

351
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,234
Thanks.

352
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,510
- Johanne works with my publisher.
- Well I'm also working on my MA.

353
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,269
I was a big fan
of Erik's manuscript.

354
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,228
What is your master's thesis about?

355
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,797
I'll probably change it a bit.

356
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,393
But it's basically about contemporary
literature. The new Norwegian authors.

357
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,993
Anyway, things are more exciting
for you, with your upcoming release.

358
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,111
You're Phillip, right?

359
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,390
"Phantom Images" is
one of my favourite books ever.

360
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,472
Particularly that long passage
toward the end.

361
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,359
Is that how you work now?

362
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,953
Phillip has been
a little tired lately.

363
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,874
But he's better now.
Right?

364
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,834
Soon he'll write
something awesome again.

365
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,070
- We had a meeting today.
- Sebastian. Hi.

366
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,791
A new cell phone ad campaign.

367
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,829
I like the edge.
It's quirky, it's weird. It works.

368
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,114
We made small talk, wondered if
we had any mutual acquaintances.

369
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,955
It turns out we did.

370
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,959
- Lars Henriksen?
- No. Lars Etterstad.

371
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,352
- Did he go to Berg High-School?
- Yes.

372
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,076
"Porno-Lars"?
They know Porno!

373
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,431
You guys know Porno-Lars?

374
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,509
It turned out this consultant had
lived in a flat share with Lars.

375
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,958
Lars had come home late one night.

376
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,590
And he'd asked if Lars wanted to
join them. But Lars answered:

377
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,109
I'm trying to cut back on TV.

378
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,279
He said he was going to read
his new Heidegger book.

379
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,638
But thanks for the offer.

380
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,280
Look at him. He has no idea that
half of Oslo call him Porno-Lars.

381
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,196
Careful, Lars. Too much Heidegger
can make you dizzy.

382
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,309
Anyone understand what's he saying?
I can't understand his sosiolect.

383
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,831
What's that tattoo? An ad?

384
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,992
"Oslo City Shopping Centre"?

385
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,192
- No, don't! I'm dry!
- Oh really?

386
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,738
So you're getting your master's?

387
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,319
Are you OK?

388
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,393
Sure. I just don't understand
your friends' humor.

389
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,828
What's Mathis Wergeland's
book called, Erik?

390
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,918
"That Which Ties Us Down."
- Right.

391
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,830
"That Which Ties Us Down."
"That."

392
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,555
- I liked Mathis' book.
- I figured.

393
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,471
If he had written in English,
he would be world-famous by now.

394
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,036
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous? Me?

395
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,119
I knew him before he was famous
and he was a jerk even then.

396
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,472
Oh "jerk" was he? Well, not just anyone
can become a famous author.

397
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,195
You do have a point. "Jerk" isn't
precise enough to describe him.

398
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,390
I just wish Mathis would -

399
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,918
- Suck negro cock in hell,
that fucking koos.

400
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,109
Hey...

401
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,193
I'm not putting up with this.

402
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,670
- He's just kidding.
- No I'm not.

403
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,236
I don't care, I've had it.
I hate people like him.

404
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,078
What you hate is war and George Bush
and the World Bank and such.

405
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,596
Who the hell do you think you are?

406
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,519
You are the most immature
people I have ever met!

407
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,510
Spreading nasty rumours about
each other... I feel sorry for you.

408
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,633
- And for him.
- Me? What are you talking about?

409
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,433
Why do you hang out with these people?

410
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,919
Sorry for me?

411
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,110
- What's she talking about?
- I've met guys like you before.

412
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,515
I just have one thing to say:

413
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,113
It can't be easy to
have problems in this crowd.

414
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,316
You're so cute when you're mad.

415
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,791
And you are incredibly banal!

416
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,609
She seemed nice.

417
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,476
Bye.

418
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,793
Hi.

419
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,514
- Hi, Erik!
- Hi.

420
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,708
- Long time no see.
- Isn't Lillian here?

421
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,235
No.

422
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,633
Does anyone want a drink?

423
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,353
- I think I'll wait.
- No, thanks.

424
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,196
- Have you seen Sten Egil Dahl?
- I doubt he'll show.

425
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,153
- But you and..?
- I just wanted her to come.

426
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,390
Are you sure that's a good idea?

427
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,796
What does your psychiatrist say?

428
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,430
Is it a problem that Kari is here?

429
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,757
- I didn't mean it like that.

430
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,631
- How are you doing?
- Fine. So-so, I guess.

431
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,157
- Are you still at the university?
- No, I don't know

432
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,792
- I'm in telemarketing.
- How interesting.

433
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,675
No. It isn't.
Actually, it sucks.

434
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,271
I heard your book
is getting published.

435
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,398
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous about that.

436
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,711
There's Mathis Wergeland.

437
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,830
Please don't come over,
you superficial imbecile.

438
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,630
Shit.

439
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,434
Look at this!
Phillip Reisnes.

440
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,393
Long time no see.
Good to have you back.

441
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,397
Are you writing?

442
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,597
No, I'm... that is...

443
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,035
Hi.
Erik. Erik Høiaas

444
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,436
This is Kari... Kari...

445
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,870
Kari-Kari? Nice to meet you.

446
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,591
I really believe in this guy.

447
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,274
See you around, all right?

448
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,593
I... I don't think...

449
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,832
I have to go.

450
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,560
Don't let him bother you.

451
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,399
I just don't feel well.

452
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,193
- I'm tired.
- What about Sten Egil Dahl?

453
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,356
Do you want to go home?

454
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,998
I can't do this. Sorry.

455
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,031
- This was a mistake.
- Don't worry about it.

456
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,280
It just isn't like it used to be.

457
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,429
I know it's important to Erik,
but I don't want to write anymore.

458
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,955
Having fun?

459
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,753
- Yes.
- Have you thought about your title?

460
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,997
- Yes, I've thought about it.
- Excellent.

461
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,119
I think "Prosopopeia"
is a good title.

462
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,878
Don't you?

463
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,389
Don't ask me, tell me.

464
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,036
Say: The book's title is
"Prosopopeia", dammit!

465
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,950
I'll remember that. Thanks.
We'll talk later.

466
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,071
Sten Egil Dahl?

467
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,237
My name is Erik Høiaas.
I'm a big fan of your work.

468
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,114
- It's a great honour for me...
- Heey, Erik! - Hi.

469
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,791
Mathis Wergeland.
I'm a big fan of yours.

470
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,152
Well, "fan" is a little teeny,
but "admirer" sound so stuffy.

471
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,911
"Crystal" is just friggin' amazing.

472
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,913
What you do in the opening chapter...

473
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,430
It's... What is it it is?

474
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,915
It's...

475
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,430
- Don't you agree?
- Absolutely.

476
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,348
- Do you write as well?
- Yes, I've written a book.

477
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,356
You probably haven't read it.

478
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,829
It hasn't been published yet.

479
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,909
- Then I probably haven't read it.
- But it will be published.

480
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,684
Excuse me, but I was on my way home.

481
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,269
But your book has been accepted?

482
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,873
<i>It struck Erik, that in Dahls mind he would
now forever be associated with Mathis.</i>

483
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,279
Phillip?

484
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,112
Has something happened?

485
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,312
I just don't feel...

486
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,036
I couldn't sleep... and...

487
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,030
It helps to turn up the volume.

488
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,792
I took a little too much Seroquel.

489
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,831
I couldn't sleep!

490
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,596
You're taking your medication?

491
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,790
Did something happen
between you and Kari?

492
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,878
Don't baby-sit me.
I need time to myself.

493
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,955
No problem.

494
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,079
Hello?

495
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,153
Hi.

496
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,273
Why have you bought me a plane ticket?

497
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,512
Have you looked at the date?

498
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,195
The exact same date

499
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,793
as the last time we went.

500
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,991
You can't just assume that

501
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,192
I can, or want to, go to Paris.

502
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,356
No pressure.

503
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,195
But can you at least consider it?

504
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,715
Lars mentioned that Phillip
and Kari were going to Paris again.

505
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,917
Erik pretended that Phillip
had already told him.

506
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,073
He studied chemistry. Was brilliant.
The best in his class.

507
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,671
He got headhunted to some
pharmaceutical company in the USA.

508
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,632
But his girlfriend couldn't handle
a long-distance relationship.

509
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,995
She got depressed. Said
she couldn't function without him.

510
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,440
So he quit his job
and moved back home.

511
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,680
After a few weeks, she dumped him.
Didn't really love him anymore.

512
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,396
He was unable to go back to work.
Now he lives with his mom.

513
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,749
You live with your mom, don't you?

514
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,198
Hi, Lillian!

515
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,271
She's probably frigid.
Any girl that pretty is.

516
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,279
- You would know, being cilibate.
- "Cilibate"?

517
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,272
- You mean celibate.

518
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,668
- Right, cilibate.

519
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,918
Maybe cilibate is how it's pronounced on
the East Side, but in civilization we say -

520
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,595
- celibate with an "e"
- You know what I meant.

521
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,359
Tonight?

522
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,752
I don't know. I have to try
to write while Phillip is away.

523
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,079
Thank you.

524
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,353
You're so cool!

525
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,237
I'll call you tomorrow.
I love you. Bye.

526
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,796
It's so embarrassing.

527
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,914
Anyway, my point is
that you need to get laid.

528
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:30,115
- Why don't you go see Lillian?
- I thought maybe we could...

529
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,992
- I can get laid whenever I want.
- With that Hitler Youth haircut?

530
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,109
I'm out of here.
Bye.

531
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,952
Bye!

532
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,910
- We were on the 4th floor last time.
- This is nice too.

533
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,472
- We had a nice time?
- Absolutely.

534
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,230
I may have been a little nervous.

535
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,313
- How did I seem to you?

536
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,520
- You seemed happy.

537
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,238
What did we do the next day?

538
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,596
We sat at a café
and talked for ages.

539
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,518
- What was the weather like?
- Raining, I think.

540
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,996
- What did we talk about?
- Everything. I can't remember.

541
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,350
But it was nice.

542
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,799
What was I like?
Was I happy?

543
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,555
- Don't you remember?
- Sure.

544
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,037
I'm glad you came.

545
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,036
I thought you were thinking about Rune.

546
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,032
I decided I had to make you
fall in love with me.

547
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,556
- You were unsure of your feelings.
- No, I wasn't.

548
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,152
Sure you were.

549
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,118
Anyway, it worked.
It worked because I told you first.

550
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,353
"When I reach zero,
you'll fall in love with me."

551
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,515
Ten.

552
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,513
Nine.

553
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,833
Eight.

554
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,117
What are you doing?

555
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,392
Seven, six.

556
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,679
Five.

557
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,799
Four.

558
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,993
Three.

559
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,234
Two.

560
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,478
One.

561
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,233
Zero.

562
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,557
You must have sat and slid down.
Your skirt had hiked up.

563
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,996
Don't worry.
You looked incredible.

564
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,548
- This feels stupid.
- Don't worry about that.

565
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,877
- Can't we...
- Come on!

566
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,233
Come on.

567
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,510
Look to the left.

568
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,392
A little down.

569
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,551
Close your legs a bit.

570
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,358
It's uncomfortable.

571
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,228
- We had sex the second night.
- They know what "sex" means.

572
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,752
No they don't. It's just
strange noises to them.

573
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,869
The French don't even understand
English without a French accent.

574
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,789
I don't think
it was until the third night.

575
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,879
- Why was I so nervous?
- You were so cute.

576
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,272
You kept talking about
how the first time never is any good.

577
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,159
No, wait.

578
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,791
What's the matter?

579
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,350
What are you thinking about?

580
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,233
Nothing.

581
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,196
Say something.

582
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,313
Why did you want us
to come back here?

583
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,993
You don't love me anymore,
is that it?

584
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,271
I don't know.

585
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,668
Of course you know.

586
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,558
FALL

587
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,550
Erik Høiaas is here.
Your book has just been published.

588
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,319
"Pro-so-po-peia."

589
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,473
You write about madness. Is this something
you have personal experience with?

590
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:44,029
Well... "Prosopopeia", isn't really...

591
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,311
- It isn't really about madness.

592
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,998
The personal is on a different
level than the biographical.

593
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:59,192
But the protagonist is searching
for "the absolute language."

594
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,715
A language which can grasp
all the world's nuances.

595
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,197
- And that is a madness of sorts.

596
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,115
A strong personal experience
can become an intense story...

597
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,993
- But what I wanted to say...

598
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:25,078
Is that these days, the exposure of private
ailments have become a tabloid requirement.

599
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,949
- Bringing up
all sorts of personal "tragedies."

600
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,872
...but that's not "literature."

601
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,314
John Pedersen,
you became an author late in life.

602
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,789
Your book is called
"The Long Journey Back."

603
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:50,279
I never thought I would become
an author. When things...

604
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,475
- Hi, Phillip.
- Hi, Erik Høiaas, long time no see.

605
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,751
- How's it going?
- I'm not really sure.

606
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,270
I don't know if you saw me on TV.
It didn't go well.

607
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,830
Forget about that. Come on over.
Geir and Morten are here.

608
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,437
It's been a while.

609
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,590
I don't know.
I'm going to Lillian's.

610
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,357
So nothing's changed there?

611
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,072
Then bring her with you.

612
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,711
We've been invited
to a party at Lars'.

613
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:41,314
<i>Two months earlier Lars felt obliged to</i>
<i>mingle with his fellow med-students.</i>

614
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,632
<i>No one had heard from him since.</i>

615
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,278
<i>That night Lars had made more than</i>
<i>a passing contact with a girl: Merethe.</i>

616
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,713
Does Lars have a girlfriend?

617
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,750
My God!

618
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,480
Then we have no choice.

619
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,913
Ok.

620
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,432
<i>Lillian was understanding</i>
<i>as always when Erik said:</i>

621
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,834
Phillip rang.
He doesn't feel well.

622
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,676
21? This must be it.

623
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,599
Hey...

624
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,394
I can't take it.
It's too sad.

625
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,591
- Hey there!
- Hey. Well... quite a party!

626
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,754
Wow, look here; The Little Lord!</i>
Out swimming with the commoners?

627
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,077
We were about to leave,
but things are picking up now.

628
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,235
- I brought my friend Johanne.
- Nice to meet you.

629
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,060
Come on in.

630
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,998
Sorry.

631
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,272
Are you all right?

632
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,718
Do you know Bjørn?

633
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,034
Yes.

634
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,434
- What's your name?
- Geir.

635
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,276
Hi, Geir.

636
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,515
Ingrid?

637
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,759
Ingrid!

638
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,072
We've had another complaint.
Can you please...

639
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,754
Henning!

640
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,669
Suck negro pussy in hell,
you fucking zayin!

641
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,434
Five.

642
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,993
Four.

643
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,394
Three.

644
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,635
Two.

645
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,359
One.

646
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,469
Zero.

647
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,636
Ten.

648
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,035
Nine.

649
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,357
Eight, seven, six, five.

650
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,554
Four, three, two, one.

651
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,998
Lillian?

652
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,719
Hi.

653
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,555
- How nice.
- Not a word, Erik.

654
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,672
Don't touch me.

655
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,713
Lillian...
Hey, come sit down.

656
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,038
I've had enough. Not just because
we never see each other.

657
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:45,360
It's that you pretend to care,
when you're so damn selfish.

658
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,679
You're such a damn cliché!

659
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,757
Don't call me.

660
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,716
Is he awake?

661
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,912
So you've seen it?

662
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,116
FORM WITHOUT SUBSTANCE.

663
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,072
Want a cup of tea?

664
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,351
Hi, Phillip.

665
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,076
No, I'm a little...

666
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,469
What?
You've written something?

667
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,038
Well...

668
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,433
This is...

669
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,754
A lot of it is good, but we've
always been honest with each other.

670
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,155
This isn't your best work.

671
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,235
But it's cool
that you're writing.

672
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,276
What?

673
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,189
I'm glad you take it like that.

674
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:17,433
It just seems... disjointed.
Even for me who knows your style.

675
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,078
I mean, you haven't
slept all night.

676
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:28,797
But there is something here.

677
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:35,637
Your water metaphor
relating to emotional distance, -

678
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,994
- but then that glides into
this erotic thing...

679
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,597
There's a lot here you can work on.

680
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,670
I don't think so.

681
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,350
- It's only the first draft.
- Don't try to be nice.

682
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:59,190
I'm not being nice. If you work on it
this might be publishable.

683
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,118
That isn't important.
I'm just writing for myself.

684
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,993
- A lot of this is good.
- No, it isn't!

685
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,031
Why can you never say what you mean?

686
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,913
I mean... You're a great writer.

687
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:26,355
All I've ever done is to recycle
Sten Egil Dahl and Tor Ulven.

688
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,395
It's no big deal.

689
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,358
- Is that recycled Sten Egil Dahl too?
- I don't know.

690
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,030
What do you mean?

691
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,518
- What the fuck are you doing?
- He's mine.

692
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,074
- Svein?
- Sorry, Erik.

693
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,397
I'm not a fag!

694
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,599
You're Erik Høiaas, aren't you?

695
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,037
- Yes.
- I saw you on television last night.

696
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,591
- Let me get you to a doctor.
- No, I'm fine.

697
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:46,152
Television is no place to discuss literature.

698
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,751
I don't know why I...

699
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,836
I've read your book.

700
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,312
Nice title.

701
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,278
Very good.

702
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,949
Except for the final part.

703
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,397
Don't try to be poetic.

704
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,676
- Are you serious?
- Yes. But the rest was good.

705
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,951
Very promising.

706
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,033
You...

707
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,709
You look much better now.

708
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:04,829
How do you feel?

709
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,871
Much better.
Much better.

710
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,389
<i>An idea had begun to take shape.</i>

711
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,034
<i>Two days later,</i>
<i>- as he lay in bed, irritated by -</i>

712
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,038
<i>- the lights from his stereo,</i>
<i>that couldn't be turned off, -</i>

713
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:27,474
<i>- it came to him:</i>
<i>He had to get out of Oslo.</i>

714
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,239
Ten.

715
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,474
Nine.

716
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,074
Eight.

717
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,438
Seven.
Six.

Five.

Two.

One.

723

Zero.

724
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,830
Hello, my name is Kari Brekke.
May I speak to Linda Saugstad?

725
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,355
- Hello, my name is...
- Kari?

726
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,557
I found you.
I managed to find you.

727
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,431
You know where I work.

728
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,471
It was always meant to be.
There were just so many things...

729
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,956
Something links us together.
I found you here, right?

730
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,755
Everything was just a mess.

731
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,320
There was something that...

732
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,556
Excuse me.

733
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,557
Can I help you?

734
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,192
- Listen to me.
- Kari?

735
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:15,792
I love you, Kari.
Everything is in synch now.

736
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,996
I love you.
I love you.

737
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,918
Stop it!

738
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,991
I can't take this anymore...

739
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,511
Phillip, hey...

740
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,199
Hey...

741
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,953
Phillip?

742
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,156
- Kari?
- Just...

743
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,476
Come on.

744
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,558
Get up.

745
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,835
<i>Erik would have left without saying</i>
<i>goodbye to Phillip or his friends.</i>

746
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,192
<i>He would have found a small</i>
<i>apartment where he could write.</i>

747
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,277
<i>Erik would have let nothing interfere</i>
<i>with his creative impulses.</i>

748
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:16,794
<i>Paradoxically, missing friends</i>
<i>and family would have inspired him.</i>

749
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,595
<i>After months of hard work,</i>
<i>he would've completed his novel.</i>

750
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:36,112
<i>The next fall Erik's second book</i>
<i>would be published in Norway.</i>

751
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,871
<i>The book would've gotten mixed reviews</i>
<i>and sparked a literary debate</i>

752
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,595
<i>- a professor from Denmark</i>
<i>would say in an article:</i>

753
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:51,795
<i>Norway now has two authors of interest:</i>
<i>Sten Egil Dahl and Erik Høiaas.</i>

754
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:57,597
<i>Erik would feel distanced from</i>
<i>this fuss, working on his new book.</i>

755
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,272
<i>Surprisingly, it was a first novel that</i>
<i>was the big hit that fall:</i>

756
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,392
<i>A coming of age, Oslo epic: "Roundabout"</i>

757
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,550
It's an attack on the World Bank,
the North-South conflict.

758
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:18,677
- That may not be obvious to everyone.
- No, but all the more important.

759
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,438
Buy it, it's important!

760
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:36,472
<i>After a year abroad, Erik would have</i>
<i>felt it was time to come home.</i>

761
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:47,271
<i>They would have met again at a café.</i>
<i>Or at a restaurant...</i>

762
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,355
<i>No, it would have been at a wedding.</i>

763
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,473
Kari is cool.

764
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,909
She's my nurse. Makes sure
I take my medicine, get dressed, -

765
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,598
- gives me sponge baths...

766
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,434
Nah, actually, we're pretty happy.

767
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,311
You all have girlfriends.
Traitors!

768
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,557
You didn't give us a choice,
running off like that.

769
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,116
Quisling.

770
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:50,199
- I'm back at the university.

771
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,959
- Studying what?

772
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,108
It may seem silly,
but I'm studying psychology.

773
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,838
That's great!

774
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,157
<i>Erik would've feared she thought</i>
<i>he was being ironic.</i>

775
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,716
<i>For he truly felt it was the most</i>
<i>touching expression of love he'd heard of.</i>

776
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,271
- He killed himself?
- Yes.

777
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,955
- I thought you knew.
- No.

778
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,472
A few months ago.

779
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,150
Does anyone know why?

780
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,669
Well, he only had two fans.

781
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:32,954
One went nuts, the other fled
the country. That was the straw...

782
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:35,632
No, I don't know.

783
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:42,592
This next song is dedicated to
my brother Geir, the politician.

784
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,758
Let's hope he doesn't get
"Fingerfucked by the Prime Minister"!

785
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,674
<i>The next day Phillip would have told</i>
<i>Erik how much he liked his book.</i>

786
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,515
<i>They would've discussed</i>
<i>Sten Egil Dahl's suicide,</i>

787
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,314
<i>- before Phillip</i>
<i>said he had run into Svein.</i>

788
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:53,075
- He seemed upset about hurting you.
- Me?

789
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:57,992
<i>Phillip's comments would inspire</i>
<i>Erik to keep working on his next novel.</i>

790
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,278
How about you?
Aren't you going to write?

791
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,109
No, I don't think so.

792
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:18,670
Though maybe the spirit will
move me again, like last time.

793
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,911
- Ten, nine.
- Hey, don't.

794
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:01,715
Eight, seven, six, five.

795
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,953
Four.

796
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,839
Three.

797
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,879
Two.

798
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,510
One.

799
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,153
Stop.

800
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,200
3

801
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:03,500
2

802
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:03,800
1

803
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:04,700
