2
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,645
You shouldn't do that.

3
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,285
Tap the glass.

4
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,764
How did you know
I was going to?

5
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,087
You must forgive
my son. He loves bees.

6
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,006
It isn't a bee. It's a wasp.

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,969
Different thing entirely.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,490
Was that him?

9
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,007
Ah, the prodigal returns.

10
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,406
Ooh.

11
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,522
Outside, Roger.
You know you're not allowed.

12
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,246
Like having a Welsh pony.

13
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,010
Will you be going up to your study?

14
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,806
No, not as yet.

15
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,441
Ah, yes. Home again.

16
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,846
Home again.

17
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,489
Mrs Munro!

18
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,202
It would appear
we've had a decrease in population.

19
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,365
Did Mr Healy not come by to take care
of the apiary whilst I was gone?

20
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,564
Yes, but he won't be able
to do it next time.

21
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,691
- Did Mr Healy say that?
- No, his daughter did.

22
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,124
She's taken him to live with her.
Too feeble, she said.

23
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,647
- Is he too feeble?
- Seemed spry enough.

24
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,603
- Chattier, maybe.
- With you?

25
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,400
With himself.

26
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,484
Key to the study.

27
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,084
- Is that lunch?
- Mm.

28
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,641
Hm...

29
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,011
"Watson had married
<i>and I was alone.</i>

30
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,565
<i>"In fact, it was on the very day
he left Baker Street,</i>

31
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,725
<i>"that the case which was to be my last
began to unfold.</i>

32
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,762
<i>"It was almost 30 years ago.
The Great War had ended</i>

33
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,081
<i>"and the tourists
had come back to Baker Street</i>

34
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,925
<i>"to catch a glimpse
of the real Sherlock Holmes.</i>

35
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,365
<i>"Thankfully, in his stories,</i>

36
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,848
<i>"Watson had always published
a false address for our actual quarters."</i>

37
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,169
So you found the right address.

38
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,804
- Why did you do it?
- Sir?

39
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,364
Break into my study.

40
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,171
My study is my sanctum sanctorum.

41
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,605
Private place.

42
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,645
Before you went to Japan,
I saw you writing that story.

43
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,289
I didn't know you wrote stories.

44
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,971
Oh, Dr Watson, yes, he was the writer.

45
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,201
Well, so I borrowed Mum's key and
went into your study, and there it was.

46
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,521
And how much did you read?

47
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,450
Just to where you stopped.
It was a good part too.

48
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,245
A man comes to Baker Street. You say,
"You've come about your wife."

49
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,045
How could you tell? Did you do the thing?

50
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,289
What thing would that be?

51
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,640
"The cane shows
the marks of a dog's teeth.

52
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,242
"The wood is from an island
southwest of Madeira."

53
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,767
That thing.

54
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,607
And how would you tell
that a man's visit was about his wife?

55
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
He wears a wedding ring?

56
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,811
No. The clues are all on that page.

57
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,762
This sentence, to be exact.

58
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,962
"One day, into the room
came a young man,

59
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,123
"in newly-pressed,
albeit inexpensive clothes."

60
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,091
The clothes are freshly-pressed.
He's a young man, though.

61
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,123
Not expensive clothes.

62
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,291
Then his wife must press them.

63
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,205
Men don't have the talent
and he can't afford a servant to do so.

64
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,007
Very good.

65
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,727
- That's how you knew it was about the wife.
- Well, no.

66
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,365
When you're a detective
and a man comes to visit you...

67
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
It's usually about his wife.

68
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,044
So why did you stop where you did?

69
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,320
Ahh...

70
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,528
Ah, did you get the things
from the chemist?

71
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,723
On order. Said it would be a few days.

72
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,165
We'll hold them to that.

73
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,723
Otherwise, triumphant, were you?

74
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,050
Like V-E Day.

75
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,167
Oh. Doctor's here.

76
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,971
- Did you catch cold in Japan?
- Does it sound it?

77
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,131
I thought you might be coming off
the tail end of something.

78
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,442
- Lost some weight as well.
- Hm.

79
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,844
Did you find what you were looking for,
the mysterious ashy prick?

80
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,522
- Prickly Ash.
- Oh, yes, sorry.

81
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,163
That was the reason the fellow
invited you to Japan, wasn't it?

82
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,402
Dig up a pile of the stuff,
smuggle it home?

83
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,206
It can't interfere
with anything you've prescribed.

84
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,924
- But surely it can't do me ill.
- In and of itself, no.

85
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,603
- You mean there might be side effects?
- Perhaps.

86
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,042
- Such as?
- Hope.

87
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,564
What was the name of the fellow
who invited you to Japan?

88
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,403
You just spent a week with the man,

89
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,847
corresponded with him for months.

90
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,125
Do you recall his name?

91
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,165
There's a flat adjacent to my surgery
that's gone to let...

92
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,287
No!

93
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,721
What happens when you don't recall
where the telephone is,

94
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,121
or you forget to turn off the gas?

95
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,369
- You can't live alone.
- I don't live alone.

96
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,205
I have the housekeeper.

97
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,121
Take this diary.

98
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,121
Each day you don't recall a name or place,

99
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,962
make a mark on the page
for that day's date.

100
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,804
And if I forget to make the mark?

101
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,282
Oh... Mm.

102
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,603
No, no, no. No. No, no, no.

103
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,170
- It's the Royal Jelly.
- Yes, well, we're not using it any more.

104
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,164
Instead, we're going to use this.

105
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,770
- It's called Prickly Ash.
- Is it food?

106
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,564
Mm...

107
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,411
Eurgh.
Looks like it came out the down-spout.

108
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,005
It came from Japan.

109
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,720
That makes all the difference.

110
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,845
You add it in as you would
the Royal Jelly, in the tea or the coffee.

111
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,882
And you should try cooking with it
to enhance your specialities.

112
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,925
Mr. Holmes?

113
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,600
Mr Holmes?

114
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,485
Tamiki Umezaki.

115
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,645
Welcome to Japan.

116
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,124
I am so honoured
you have accepted my invitation.

117
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,244
We spend tonight at my house.
Tomorrow we begin our search.

118
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,206
I have owned
your book for 20 years.

119
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,770
I purchased my copy
when it first appeared in print.

120
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,884
I hope you'll do me the honour
of a personal inscription.

121
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,526
Oh, yes. Of course.

122
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,801
Um...

123
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,404
Mr Umezaki, how close to the city
does the Prickly Ash grow?

124
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,049
It is found mostly near the sea.

125
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,924
And how far shall we have to go?

126
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,850
Where I am thinking
is two days' journey by train.

127
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,366
You are very eager?

128
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,210
I'm in the middle of a project
that I'm keen to finish

129
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,204
and my wits must be at their sharpest.

130
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,489
I want to be able to benefit
from the effect as soon as possible.

131
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,040
- It's that urgent?
- I fear it's so.

132
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,562
You are very great detective!

133
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,530
Thank you very much.

134
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,770
My mother, she wonders

135
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,922
if you have brought your famous hat.

136
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,648
Oh, the deer stalker.

137
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,883
That was an embellishment
of the illustrator.

138
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,001
I've never worn one.

139
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,284
- And the pipe?
- I prefer a cigar.

140
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,085
I told Watson,
if I ever write a story myself,

141
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,970
it will be to correct
the million misconceptions

142
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,042
created by his imaginative license.

143
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,249
Did you write such a story?

144
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,846
But I'm trying to do so now.

145
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,561
Hm.

146
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,160
I must finish with you before I die.

147
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,408
"So you've come about your wife."

148
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,288
<i>"You've come about your wife."</i>

149
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,971
"You've come..."

150
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,927
Roger.

151
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,961
Here.

152
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,050
I'll see you after lunch.

153
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,167
I'm going to need some help with the bees.

154
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,724
So you found the right address.

155
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,206
A friendly porter at 221 B...

156
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,406
It's just a minor fiction
to mislead the curious.

157
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,004
Most of them seem to be American.

158
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,131
Have a seat, Mr Kelmot.

159
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,127
So...

160
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,565
You've come about your wife.

161
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,482
- How did you know?
- It doesn't matter.

162
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,643
Tell me what you have to say.

163
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,650
My wife is named Ann.

164
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,128
Her mother died in childbirth.

165
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,929
Her father was a colonel,
killed in that business at Waziristan.

166
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,530
<i>We wanted very much to have children.</i>

167
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,167
She lost our first child
in her third month...

168
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,691
<i>Our second in her fourth.</i>

169
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,408
<i>We were told
it was too dangerous to try again.</i>

170
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,364
<i>Ann was... Distraught.</i>

171
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,762
It was as though each of them lost
had been a real child, as opposed to...

172
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,121
Thank you.

173
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,961
For a time, she even insisted
I have a pair of headstones carved

174
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,203
and placed in our cemetery plot,
as if their bodies were buried beneath.

175
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,482
She was in desperate need of something
to soothe this dangerous melancholy.

176
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,245
She liked music
so I suggested the glass armonica.

177
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,210
- The armonica?
- My father's most prized possession.

178
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,203
<i>He played it constantly
till the day he died.</i>

179
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,330
<i>I had it brought to the house
and arranged a month's worth of lessons.</i>

180
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,721
<i>One hour per week.</i>

181
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,404
Soon Ann asked me if she could
increase the lessons to twice a week.

182
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,526
Then three times. Then every day.

183
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,603
<i>So, she took up the avocation
you hoped she would.</i>

184
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,608
Why are you here, Mr Kelmot?

185
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,082
Mr Holmes, my Ann has changed.

186
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,846
And it isn't just the lessons
or her obsession with the instrument.

187
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,769
<i>One day I was outside the room
and suddenly her playing stopped.</i>

188
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,648
<i>And I heard her saying, quite clearly...</i>

189
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,690
Grace? James?

190
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,331
Those were to be
the names of your children?

191
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,529
When I confronted Ann, she denied it.

192
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,124
So I forbad her playing the armonica
and I forbad her taking the lessons.

193
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,720
The woman who teaches them,
Madame Schirmer,

194
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,330
is a person of dangerous beliefs.

195
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,888
The dangerous beliefs of a music teacher?

196
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,485
She's put a spell on Ann,

197
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,049
preying upon her weak frame of mind,
for what reason I cannot say.

198
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,088
Have you proof of this?

199
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,201
Following my instructions, she stopped
seeing Madame Schirmer.

200
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,166
I received in the post...
Three receipts from the woman.

201
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,487
Each for the payment
of one armonica lesson.

202
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,810
Again Ann denied it.

203
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,407
Consequently, my wife is no longer
permitted to withdraw money from the bank.

204
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,691
<i>Then yesterday, I followed Ann to the
place where the woman gives her lessons.</i>

205
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,247
<i>Even on the pavement below
I could hear her playing.</i>

206
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,242
<i>Naturally, I went inside,
but the Schirmer woman said,</i>

207
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,845
"Your wife is not here."

208
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,844
Last night, I questioned Ann.

209
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,960
And she said that she hadn't been
to Madame Schirmer's rooms.

210
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,167
Not for weeks.

211
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,002
Do you have a portrait of your wife?

212
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,641
I shall take your case
if you answer just one last question.

213
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,801
Certainly.

214
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,609
What perfume does your wife wear?

215
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,047
Roger?

216
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,207
It's late. Lights out like it's the Blitz.

217
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,651
Look at you.

218
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,250
Do you remember your dad?

219
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,170
I remember him holding my hand
and taking me to the sea.

220
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,049
You're not remembering.
That's the picture.

221
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,402
What about the invisible stories?

222
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,850
Some nights at bedtime,
your dad would make up stories.

223
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,123
He'd... He'd say, "Give me three things."

224
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,123
And you'd say, "A ball, a cat and Roger."

225
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,921
So then he'd...

226
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,601
He'd make up some tale about
a ball that had a pet cat named Roger.

227
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,001
Always a something
and something and Roger.

228
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,602
You don't remember
any of the invisible stories?

229
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,884
No. Do you?

230
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,604
I was never any good at stories.

231
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,521
Sleep well.

232
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,165
The first thing to know
<i>is there's no danger.</i>

233
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,371
Bees aren't interested in harming you.
Their only concern is self-preservation.

234
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,644
- From people?
- They're much too clever for people.

235
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,762
Their enemies are the weather,
disease and predators.

236
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,571
The wasp is their particular antagonist.

237
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,806
Did you know that one wasp can kill
40 honey bees in under a minute?

238
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,250
In consequence, we do not like wasps.

239
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,244
- Yes, sir. We do not like wasps.
- Ah.

240
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,087
The queen runs the colony.

241
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,007
The drones service the queen.

242
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,441
Hands up.

243
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,451
Workers do the work. As it should be.

244
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,884
Of concern is the latest decrease
in the bee population.

245
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,205
We've identified the problem,
and now we must solve it.

246
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,522
Right. There you are. Off you go.

247
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,846
- Have you ever been bitten by a bee?
- Stung.

248
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,042
Bees don't have teeth. Yes, I have.

249
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,247
Well, not often, though.

250
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,441
7,816 times.

251
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,081
I keep a record.

252
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,643
You're not entirely dreadful.

253
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,761
You ever been bit?

254
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,882
No. I have never been bit.

255
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,249
Well, people work
with bees all the time, don't they?

256
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,444
What is Royal Jelly?

257
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,244
It's a special secretion
of the worker bees.

258
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,563
- And it's royal because?
- It feeds the queen.

259
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,246
Bravo.

260
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,489
It was the jelly's curative powers
that prompted my monograph,

261
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,201
<i>The Value of Royal Jelly</i>

262
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,005
<i>with Further Comments on the
Potential Health Benefits of Prickly Ash.</i>

263
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,449
- What's that?
- Prickly Ash, hm?

264
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,411
Well, in Japanese, <i>Hire Sansho</i> is the
common word for <i>Zanthoxylum Piperitum.

265
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,528
It's used to treat
various degenerative diseases.

266
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,766
Anaemia, circulatory conditions...
Arthritis and...

267
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,524
Hm. What's it called?

268
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,451
Oh. Senility.

269
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,404
That was a witticism.

270
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,967
The newest research suggests that Prickly
Ash has far more promise than Royal Jelly.

271
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,044
Henceforth, Prickly Ash
is all that we should use.

272
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Have you written more
about the man and his wife?

273
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,285
- All in good time.
- Is it real?

274
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,644
Of course. Fiction is worthless!

275
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,648
The place you stopped. Why do you want
to know the wife's perfume?

276
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,722
- Cameo Rose, is it?
- Yes, sir.

277
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,850
Always leaves a trace.

278
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,123
Madame Schirmer.

279
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,007
Madame Schirmer,
this is Thomas Kelmot. Let me in.

280
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,081
Madame Schirmer!

281
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,730
Herr Kelmot, I did warn!
You come, I call the Metropolitan Police!

282
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,169
Madame, my friend's emotional state
is such that, if denied entry,

283
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,886
he might not be able
to restrain his passions.

284
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,051
Allow us both in,
and I will take full responsibility.

285
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,731
- Thank you so much.
- Who is this?

286
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,927
- This gentleman is a detective.
- <i>Ja?</i> His badge, please?

287
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,690
His name is Mr Sherlock Holmes.

288
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,003
You don't mind if I close this, do you?
Such a draught.

289
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,882
No. I have seen Sherlock Holmes
in the magazines.

290
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,009
With the hat and the pipe.
It was never this person.

291
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,766
Madame Schirmer, I saw Ann enter
this place, I demand you produce her.

292
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,202
Your wife is not here.

293
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,682
- You said that last time.
- You question my truth?

294
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,241
Oswald, my dear, it is a wish
to know if you are this man's wife.

295
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,643
- No.
- You could be in disguise.

296
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,281
- I don't think so.
- <i>Voilà!</i>

297
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,605
It is, I believe,
what the English call a water closet.

298
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,849
She was here! I saw her!

299
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,248
Mr Kelmot,
if you insist on following your wife

300
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,129
when you have employed me to do the same,

301
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,485
one or the other of us
will find himself made redundant.

302
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,562
- He is distraught.
- He is a fool.

303
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,211
The armonica used to be thought of
as an instrument of the black arts,

304
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,800
said to be used to call for the dead.

305
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,283
Something to do with
the nature of the glasses.

306
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,011
You don't believe that, surely?

307
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,045
What I believe
plays no part in this matter.

308
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,686
When was Mrs Kelmot last here?

309
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,490
Weeks now.

310
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,611
Then the receipts you posted to her
address were for Oswald's lessons.

311
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,090
Mrs Kelmot is paying for them.

312
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,050
Frau Kelmot is passionate, but an amateur.

313
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,880
She knew it was Oswald who has the gift.

314
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,806
- You knew she was not here.
- Of course.

315
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,725
Oswald doesn't wear her scent.

316
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,731
You are still not Sherlock Holmes!

317
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,611
How considerate.

318
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,004
You waited for me.

319
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,241
What are you doing?

320
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,403
Trying to see
if I can tell where I've been.

321
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,041
Don't you know?

322
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,205
Mr Holmes can tell things like that
just from looking at a person.

323
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,803
- Where are you off to?
- See to the bees!

324
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,450
You'll eat your breakfast first!

325
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,240
Got a letter from your aunt the other day.

326
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,569
She says there's a couple in Portsmouth
opening a hotel there.

327
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,449
- Need a housekeeper.
- Why would we want to live in Portsmouth?

328
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,249
- Can't stay here forever.
- Why not?

329
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
- Because we can't.
- What's in Portsmouth?

330
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,600
- This couple are opening a hotel there...
- You said that.

331
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,522
You'll leave the table when
you're finished and not before.

332
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,761
I'm not finished.

333
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,761
You don't eat that Japanese muck.

334
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,764
It's <i>Hire Sansho.</i>

335
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,001
- I know you like working with the hive...
- It's an apiary.

336
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,761
And you like being given responsibility,
but I shouldn't get too close.

337
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,525
- Bees don't bite.
- I don't mean the bees.

338
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,524
Mr Holmes won't be here forever.

339
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,488
Your aunt says
this hotel might even take you on.

340
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,331
- They got porters and...
- Have porters.

341
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,486
Finished.

342
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,606
Chemist delivered your things.
Shall I have Roger open the crate?

343
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,042
No. I'll see to it when I'm finished.

344
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,246
Yes, sir.

345
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,041
Sir?

346
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,641
I know Roger's been a help to you.
He's a good boy.

347
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,851
He's always been clever.

348
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,925
His dad and I weren't the sort to know the
things a boy like Roger takes interest in.

349
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,562
Exceptional children are often the product
of unremarkable parents.

350
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,404
I've got a sister.
She lives in Portsmouth.

351
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,240
A couple of her acquaintants
are opening a private hotel there,

352
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,523
say they're willing
to take Roger and me on.

353
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,524
You have a sister?

354
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,605
Never would have thought it.

355
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,483
Is this a matter of wages?

356
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,966
No.

357
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,080
Hm.

358
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,681
I shall take this under advisement.

359
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,448
My mother was sad to see you leave.

360
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,041
I'm rather sorry now
I didn't bring the deerstalker.

361
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,006
- You said you never wore one.
- Well, yes, but it would've pleased her.

362
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,322
She wanted the fictional.
You are the real.

363
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,964
Well, I'm not sure that's true.

364
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,645
I think I was real once
until John made me into fiction.

365
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,762
And then after that, I had little choice.

366
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,164
Play the part as he'd fashioned it,
or become its contradiction.

367
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,365
I'm actually quite fond of a pipe,

368
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,761
but to smoke it, especially in public,

369
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:55,848
after it became so well known a prop,
seemed vulgar.

370
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,970
So, Dr Watson's imagination changed you?

371
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,926
I've never had much use for imagination.

372
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,811
I prefer facts.

373
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,489
My father would bring me here as a child.
It was designed as a miniature.

374
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,002
We walk as giants.

375
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,323
The stones represent the lives
of those he has lost.

376
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,841
Oh...

377
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,166
Sherlock-sen!

378
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,770
- Hire Sansho?
- Prickly Ash.

379
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,004
- Mr Holmes.
- Hmm?

380
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,885
Too late to check on the bees?

381
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,966
Not in the least.

382
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,486
Bee check!

383
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,930
- They're quiet.
- Yes.

384
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,684
What happens when the bees die?

385
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,010
Is this a metaphysical question?

386
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,566
I mean, do you mourn them?

387
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,528
Oh, I can't say that I've ever mourned
the dead, bees or otherwise.

388
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,648
I concentrate on circumstances.

389
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,531
How did it die? Who was responsible?

390
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,087
Death, grieving, mourning,

391
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,051
they're all commonplace.

392
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,248
Logic is rare, and so...

393
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,650
I dwell on logic.

394
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,089
Well, thank you, kind sir.

395
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,761
Night, bees.

396
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,001
Sweet dreams, bees.

397
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,247
Now, what do you say
we go for a dip tomorrow?

398
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,530
- In the sea?
- Yes.

399
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,761
It'll be brisk.

400
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,166
Good for the blood!

401
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,240
All right, then.

402
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,324
What sort of books do you like, hmm?

403
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,201
Apart from Dr Watson's stories
and books about bees.

404
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,006
Those are all the books I have.

405
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,042
Well, there's a perfectly good library
right here, inside.

406
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,200
You can take any book you like.

407
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,406
Mr. Holmes?

408
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,640
Are we going for our swim?

409
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,765
I've already seen to the apiary.

410
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,645
Are you all right?

411
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,210
I'm perfectly...

412
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,246
I'm quite...

413
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,521
Perfectly fine.

414
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,089
All right, Roger.

415
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,123
You go along. I'll catch you up.

416
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,127
Roger! Come along or we'll lose the day.

417
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,207
Well done.

418
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,769
The photograph is her, isn't it?
The woman in the story.

419
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,281
Yes.

420
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,726
Is she why you're writing it?

421
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,369
I wouldn't say I was writing it...

422
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,724
It's more I'm trying to remember it.

423
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,605
Ah, thank you.

424
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,321
A few months ago, my brother Mycroft died.

425
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,241
<i>His club, the Diogenes,</i>

426
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,562
<i>asked that I go up to London
to retrieve his things.</i>

427
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,120
<i>I was given a small chest
containing the Watson stories,</i>

428
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,286
<i>none of which I'd ever actually read.</i>

429
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,202
<i>They were as John always described them,</i>

430
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,763
<i>penny dreadfuls
with an elevated prose style.</i>

431
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,207
<i>But one of the titles piqued my interest.</i>

432
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,006
<i>The story was familiar,
but its ending felt very, very wrong.</i>

433
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,729
<i>I'd not seen
any of the cinematic depictions.</i>

434
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,043
<i>But by a fortunate chance,
an opportunity soon arose.</i>

435
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,407
<i>It's strange to see a semblance
of one's self 40 feet high...</i>

436
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,685
<i>- I fear for my Ann's sanity.
- Fear for her sanity?</i>

437
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,728
<i>Dear man, you should fear for your life.</i>

438
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,247
<i>Whatever do you mean?</i>

439
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,051
<i>Murder, Mr Kelmot. Murder.</i>

440
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,086
...and played <i>as
a character out of pantomime.</i>

441
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,482
<i>Poisoned?</i>

442
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,210
<i>With what means have I?</i>

443
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,482
<i>Your armonica, Madame Schirmer.</i>

444
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,362
<i>- Preposterous!
- Or rather, the glasses.</i>

445
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,450
<i>It is the lead in the crystal
that creates the unique tone.</i>

446
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,804
<i>Absorbed into the blood through the skin,</i>

447
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,566
<i>small exposure can produce confusion,
hallucinations.</i>

448
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:02,127
<i>But constant, obsessive contact
can end in insanity and death.</i>

449
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,410
Every plot twist came
<i>with a twirl of a moustache</i>

450
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,482
<i>and ended in an exclamation mark.</i>

451
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,521
<i>Our would-be murderer is ingenious.</i>

452
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,805
<i>Surely you're not referring to...</i>

453
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,407
<i>I'm afraid, Mrs Kelmot, you will
have to find yourself a new music teacher.</i>

454
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,281
<i>Oh.</i>

455
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,684
<i>Absolute rubbish!</i>

456
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,690
What possible motive could that
German woman have had to kill Ann?

457
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,485
That night I searched for something
to jog my memory of the actual case.

458
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,005
<i>And there it was... Her picture.</i>

459
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,650
You know, a few years ago,
I could have told you everything

460
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,290
about the woman in that photograph.

461
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,402
Certainly I'd recall
what had become of her,

462
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,721
whether she was victim or culprit.

463
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,721
But that night...

464
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,290
I couldn't remember any of it.

465
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,805
All I knew for certain
was that the case was my last

466
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,326
and it was why I left the profession,

467
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,727
came down here,

468
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,204
Retired to my bees.

469
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,286
So, I decided to
write the story down on paper

470
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,004
as it was, not as John made it.

471
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,330
Get it right before I die.

472
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,809
You're not going to die.

473
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,881
Roger.

474
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,527
I'm 93.

475
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,600
I had a great uncle
who lived to be 102.

476
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,889
Well, then, that seals my fate.

477
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,882
What are the odds that you would
know two men who would live that long?

478
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,610
Well, I didn't actually know him.

479
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,086
I'll see to the bees.

480
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,365
Ow! Mr Holmes!

481
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,487
Mr. Holmes!

482
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,600
Aargh. Aargh.

483
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,405
I've been stung.

484
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,887
Unlike the wasp,
the bee always leaves its sting.

485
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,605
- I must have done something stupid.
- Oh, no.

486
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,004
Sometimes...
There's no reason at all.

487
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,089
Right. Salt water, you drink that.

488
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,171
Or onion juice
to prevent serious consequences.

489
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,722
And no need to tell your mother
about all this.

490
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,490
We don't want to worry her, do we?

491
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,849
You going to go back to the story?

492
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,203
- Is that the price for your silence?
- Tight lips.

493
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,208
How considerate.
You waited for me.

494
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,647
Good afternoon.

495
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,205
- Sir?
- Tea for one in the window.

496
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,811
Certainly, sir. Mind the step.

497
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,366
"I do you say?

498
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,920
It took all the strength he had
just to write out the cheque.

499
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,771
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

500
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,764
Well, here we are.

501
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,721
- Have you used this before?
- No. I haven't.

502
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,442
It is highly poisonous.
A drop will more than suffice.

503
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,567
Thank you.

504
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,565
It's just Thomas is in such a state.
He insisted I made certain.

505
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,290
Reassure Mr Kelmot

506
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,087
that the particulars of the will
have not changed since he dictated them.

507
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,406
Your possessions are bequeathed to him,
as his are to you.

508
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,407
Thank you so much.
It was so good to see you.

509
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,285
- Excuse me.
- Yes, miss?

510
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,805
Is the 8:10 the fast service?

511
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,042
The 8.10's the slow one,
makes local stops.

512
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,086
And the 9:05?

513
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,568
That's the fast train,
goes right on through.

514
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,369
- All aboard!
- Thank you.

515
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,325
All aboard.

516
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,569
Honeybees are attracted to you.

517
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,241
It's the scent. Cameo Rose.

518
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,491
- Oh.
- She thinks you're a flower.

519
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,923
Must confuse the little thing no end.

520
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,367
May I?

521
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,767
Oh.

522
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,367
Very kind.

523
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,127
Ah. The iris. Amazing resilience.

524
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,844
Enough light and they will grow
in the most uninhabitable regions,

525
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,571
desert, cold, rock.

526
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,482
Why do you suppose it is that something
as small and insignificant as the iris

527
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,121
should be so much stronger than we are?

528
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,247
Perhaps they're less affected
by what goes on around them.

529
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,407
Hm.

530
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,523
- Are you a botanist?
- Amateur only.

531
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,443
I am, by disposition, a hobbyist.

532
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,651
In fact, if I may, there is one particular
hobby of mine that might amuse you.

533
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,286
I can see the future.

534
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,809
Shall I read your palm?
I promise I'll find nothing dreadful.

535
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,561
What about our friend?

536
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,408
Oh.

537
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,481
Oh.

538
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,008
Hm. Hm.

539
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,526
Your parents are gone.

540
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,405
Your mother long ago,
your father more recently.

541
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,203
You had love in your heart for someone...

542
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,048
No, for more than one person.

543
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,969
But they have left you,
and your love for them has nowhere to go.

544
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,367
You're in pain.

545
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,043
But you must not allow your pain
to guide your actions.

546
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,689
Where that leads...
The lines are not so distinct.

547
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,249
- Why?
- I beg your pardon?

548
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,886
You see so much.

549
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,320
Why can't you see what happens next?

550
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,404
- The lines...
- Yes, you said.

551
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,291
Ply your parlour tricks elsewhere,
Mr Holmes.

552
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,567
"Wait."

553
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,087
I can't...

554
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,805
I can't remember.

555
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,522
Mum! Mum!

556
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,566
Mr Holmes!

557
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,006
- Was it the smoke knocked him out?
- Could have done.

558
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,370
Most likely he stood up too quickly
and lost consciousness.

559
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,967
It isn't the first time.

560
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,762
The last housekeeper
didn't know what to do.

561
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,611
He must have decided
to take it subcutaneously.

562
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,400
Well, now we can't leave.

563
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,606
No. Made sure of that, didn't he?

564
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,286
Where's the Hire Sansho?

565
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,524
- The Prickly Ash.
- If it's not there, I'm sure I don't know.

566
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,323
- Did you throw it out?
- Why would I do that?

567
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,201
For spite and malice.

568
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,883
- Where'd you get words like that?
- The dictionary.

569
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,610
Like as not, he took the muck himself.
Got burnt up with the rest of it.

570
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,247
Those can go on the fire.

571
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,689
Did Mr. Holmes say you were to do this?

572
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,727
- He always disposes of that sort.
- How do you know what sort these are?

573
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,360
You want to know who writes to him?

574
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,807
Pensioners who think
they've solved Jack the Ripper.

575
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,485
Widows who've lost their cats

576
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,961
and just know he's the only
man on Earth who can find them.

577
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,608
He's the last resort
for every lunatic out there.

578
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,291
- It's not your decision.
- It is...

579
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,166
If I'm to be a full-bore medical staff
at cook's wages.

580
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,682
He's an invalid.
Needs a nurse, not a housekeeper.

581
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,171
All he did was took a fall.

582
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,165
Your granddad was hale and hearty
60 summers then he took a fall.

583
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,964
It was three weeks to the day he died.

584
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,167
Should be in hospital.
That or one of them places.

585
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,566
- He'll get better!
- And the day he does is the day we go.

586
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,887
Is that clear?

587
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,326
Hm.

588
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,049
- Oh.
- Got a letter from Japan.

589
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,685
It's from Mr Umezaki.

590
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,730
- Have you read it?
- No. Wanted to.

591
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,005
Sin of desire. You're a Catholic.

592
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,642
Mum says you throw out
most of the letters you get.

593
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,125
And why do you think that is?

594
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,202
The people who write
want you to solve things.

595
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,608
If you read their letters,
you'd want to help.

596
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,411
Oh, no. You give me too much credit.

597
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,841
It's just if I were to read them,
I'd feel obliged to respond.

598
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,171
Perhaps Mr Umezaki's
asking you to go back to Japan.

599
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,801
Oh. I'll never go back to Japan.

600
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,131
- Why not?
- Long journey, old man.

601
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,768
- You made it before.
- That was before.

602
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,729
Maybe you could get more Prickly Ash.

603
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,211
The Prickly Ash hasn't made
a bit of difference to my memory,

604
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,089
any more than the Royal Jelly did.

605
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,967
Yes.

606
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,842
The only inspiration for any sort
of recollections has been you.

607
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,610
Go on. You open it.

608
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,571
He's writing to say his mother is dead.

609
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,281
How could you tell?

610
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,330
Mr Umezaki swore
that he would never contact me again.

611
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,409
The only thing that would
make him change his mind

612
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,051
would be a deathbed instruction
from his mother.

613
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,448
A good son always does
what his mother asks.

614
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,600
Mr Holmes!

615
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,844
You're not to be out of bed!

616
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:03,251
Mrs Munro, I have counted the steps
from the bed to the window,

617
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,001
- from the window to the...
- You're not to do anything on your own.

618
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,087
You're to ring.

619
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,405
I thought it was an imposition.

620
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,369
It will be an imposition
if you lose your bearings

621
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,329
and end up on the floor for me to collect!

622
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,485
I hadn't realised that this
had become an industrial dispute.

623
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,161
I've been trying
to calculate the likelihood

624
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,767
that we should find Hire Sansho
in a place so utterly devoid of life.

625
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,366
Perhaps it is life re-asserting itself.

626
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,886
<i>Hire Sansho.</i>

627
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,005
How does it taste?

628
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,402
It isn't for the taste that we sought it.

629
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,448
Ah, now, before we leave,
there's something that I mustn't forget.

630
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,889
I've signed it, as you requested.

631
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,327
Oh.

632
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,247
Not certain you can read my scrawl.

633
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,922
"To Mr Umezaki,
who has not owned this book for long."

634
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,406
You haven't had this book for 20 years.
It came from the library.

635
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,444
The glue mark shows
where you removed the card jacket.

636
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,607
You know nothing about bees
or Royal Jelly or Prickly Ash.

637
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,770
Enough to bring you here.

638
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,765
During our correspondence
over the last few months...

639
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,928
Was my name not familiar to you?

640
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,287
- No.
- My father's, then?

641
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,451
Masuo Umezaki?

642
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,685
- I never knew your father.
- He was a diplomat in London, years ago.

643
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,122
He loved all things English.

644
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,611
The first gift he gave to me
was a cricket bat.

645
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,249
The second was this.

646
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,282
In English so as to
"assist my education."

647
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,961
"After consulting with the
very great detective Sherlock Holmes,

648
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,764
"I realise
it's in the best interests of us all

649
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,320
"that I remain in England indefinitely.

650
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,642
"You will see from this book that
he is a very wise and intelligent man,

651
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,043
"and that his say in this matter
should not be taken lightly."

652
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,924
We never heard from him again.

653
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,291
- I'm sorry.
- My mother is dying.

654
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,850
She grew old without a husband.
All because of you.

655
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,401
I understand.

656
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,563
The last time you heard from your father
was the first time you heard about me.

657
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:50,368
Masuo vanished from your life
and I arrived... In the form of a book.

658
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,084
One replaced the other, as it were.

659
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,328
I suggest you and your mother
take whatever time you have

660
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,880
to come to terms
with the facts of the case.

661
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,127
A man abandoned his family
and wrote his son a story.

662
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,411
He wouldn't be the first to cloak
his cowardice in a flag of sacrifice.

663
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,767
I'm sorry.

664
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,569
But I never knew your father.

665
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,884
I shall not bother you
any longer with my questions.

666
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,203
But if the Prickly Ash succeeds,
you will let me know?

667
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,006
Aargh, argh!

668
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,730
Aargh!

669
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,487
Help.

670
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,767
Help.

671
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,527
Thank you.

672
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,490
I look like I've been attacked
by the Hound of the Baskervilles.

673
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,529
- Can't let Mum see you wearing that top.
- No.

674
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,688
- It's evidence.
- Yes.

675
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,328
What of? A murder?

676
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,770
Oh... I've something for you.

677
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,527
No.

678
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,007
<i>Apis Cerana Japonica.</i>

679
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,485
- They have bees in Japan?
- Yes. Just like our bees.

680
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,005
Only they're Japanese.

681
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,164
No, it's for you. It's a gift.

682
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,328
Oh. Thank you.

683
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,608
<i>Arigato</i>, as they say in Japan.

684
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,205
Something the matter?

685
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,050
You lost another dozen bees today.

686
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,009
- A dozen?
- What do you think it is?

687
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,329
An outbreak of mortality.

688
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,451
Could be a disease we've not seen before,
or a sudden mutation.

689
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,810
You bring up some corpses
and we'll examine them.

690
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,330
- Yes, sir!
- And my glass.

691
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,608
Study. Should be in one of the drawers.

692
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,687
Roger?

693
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,687
Roger?

694
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,721
- Mr Holmes feels better today.
- Is that so?

695
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,327
Hm.

696
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,285
Mr Holmes feels so much better,
we're about to start an investigation.

697
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,047
Of what?

698
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,203
The crime wave that has done away
with a number of our apiary's

699
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,248
most prominent residents.

700
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,162
Well. If you need suspects,
you know where to find me.

701
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,204
Mum, wait.

702
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,246
I bet if we asked,
Mr Holmes would... Do his thing.

703
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,320
The thing he does where he tells people

704
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,561
who they are and where they've been,
just from looking.

705
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,481
Do Mum for her.

706
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,241
I'm sure your mother
doesn't need to be told where she's been.

707
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,128
Let's not bother Mr Holmes
with any foolishness.

708
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,964
It's not foolishness. Here.

709
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,644
You come and stand in front of Mr Holmes.
Just like that.

710
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,248
And he will tell you where you've been.

711
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,687
Do it.

712
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,247
- You want her to turn in a circle?
- No, that won't be necessary.

713
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,167
Turn in a circle.

714
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,685
You've been away most of the day.

715
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,250
The soot on your dress attests
that you went by train to Portsmouth,

716
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,680
as all other nearby rail lines
which might accommodate

717
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,528
a return trip of this length
are under repair or beyond it.

718
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,246
In Portsmouth, you met
the couple who run the hotel.

719
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,046
Your hair and nails are evidence that you
wished to make a favourable impression.

720
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,204
They made you an offer, you accepted.

721
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,961
You declined tea,
and did not see the sister

722
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,242
for whom you have no particular fondness,

723
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:54,611
using my indisposition
as an excuse to hurry back.

724
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,486
- It wasn't an excuse.
- You accepted?

725
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,727
Start a week Monday.

726
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,247
Both of us?

727
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,207
- We're both going.
- She wants me to be a bootblack!

728
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,246
- Roger!
- She wants me to do what she does!

729
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,650
There is no shame in what I do!

730
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,560
You complain enough about it!
Always going on about how hard things are.

731
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,729
And you wish you had it better!
She can barely read!

732
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,721
Go after her.

733
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,449
Apologise for saying things
that were meant to hurt.

734
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,640
You were cruel!

735
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,809
If you don't apologise,
you will regret it.

736
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,686
- People always say that.
- Because it's true.

737
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,922
<i>Moi, je regrette tellement.</i>

738
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,289
- You regret...
- So much!

739
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,248
Your dad hated what he did for a living.

740
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,687
Mechanic in a garage,
like his dad before him.

741
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,881
When he got called up, he said to me,

742
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,564
"My love, I'll not spend this war

743
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,768
"underneath the oil pan
of some toff's jeep.

744
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,649
"I'm gonna put in for the RAF."

745
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,287
So he did.

746
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:31,927
He trained.

747
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,649
Scored high marks, got assigned
to a Bristol Blenheim, Mark IV.

748
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,361
Blown out of the sky. First time up.

749
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,162
All his mates who worked the motor pool
came home without a scratch.

750
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,249
I shouldn't have said what I said.

751
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,686
Lesson there, then.

752
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,645
Don't say everything you think.

753
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,567
Look.

754
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,600
- How did you find that?
- In your desk.

755
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,726
- Couldn't have.
- The one in the corner.

756
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,249
Didn't know it was a desk
until I opened it

757
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,290
Oh, that's not my desk, it's John's.

758
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,603
He left it at Baker Street
when he went off to get married.

759
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,564
Yes, and there's a secret compartment

760
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,680
containing the very glove
you've been writing about.

761
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,200
I know you say Dr Watson didn't always
get things right, but in the story...

762
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,163
I am not working on that story any more.

763
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,244
Yes, but in Watson's story
he does have the armonica in it.

764
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,209
And the German lady. And that glove.

765
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,404
- So maybe he did get things right.
- No, that's not possible.

766
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,809
- John had gone from Baker Street by then.
- Well, then why was it in there?

767
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,081
I don't know!

768
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,927
And if I ever did know, I don't remember.

769
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,771
If you can't remember, then why couldn't
the case have been a success

770
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,001
like Dr Watson wrote it?

771
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,003
Because it was my last case.

772
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,367
And if I'd brought it
to a successful conclusion,

773
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,249
I wouldn't have left the profession

774
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,644
and spent 35 years here,
in this place, away from the world!

775
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,888
I chose exile for my punishment,
but what was it for?

776
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,930
I must have done something
terribly wrong...

777
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,248
And I've no evidence of what it was.

778
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,724
Only pain, guilt...

779
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,125
Useless, worthless feelings!

780
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,243
I wish to God
I'd never even taken Umezaki's case!

781
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,847
- Kelmot's.
- What?

782
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,851
Kelmot's case. You said Umezaki.

783
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,408
Roger. Tea's ready.

784
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,165
Best clear this up.

785
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,927
Mr Holmes. Would you like your tea now?

786
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,446
Mr Holmes?

787
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,689
If you die...
What'll happen to the bees?

788
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,004
I haven't a clue.

789
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,241
One can't solve everything.

790
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,007
Said to be used
<i>to call for the dead.</i>

791
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,647
<i>Death, mourning, grief...</i>

792
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,005
<i>They're all commonplace.</i>

793
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,522
<i>Logic is rare.</i>

794
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,561
The dead are not so very far away.

795
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,041
They're just on the other side
of the wall.

796
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,210
Now, whenever did you say that?

797
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,091
Ply your parlour tricks elsewhere,
Mr Holmes.

798
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,282
My husband could never succeed
at deception so long as I do his laundry.

799
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,330
I don't know much about your profession,

800
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,201
but I doubt predicting the future
of women you're engaged to follow

801
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,441
is common practice.

802
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,169
It was intended only as a means
to achieve a desired result.

803
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,448
- That being what?
- To delay your actions.

804
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,082
To keep you from this appointment
you seem so eager to make.

805
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,370
Even before I glimpsed you today,

806
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,921
I'd gleaned some of the passionate
feelings you have for your husband.

807
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,487
The man who took away the music you loved,

808
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,168
denied you the pleasures of your lessons,

809
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,647
even refused even to mark a child's grave.

810
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,571
All these predicted your antipathy.

811
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,287
And then I witnessed your actions.

812
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,291
<i>Forging his signature...</i>

813
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,964
<i>Drawing down his account,</i>

814
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,800
<i>purchasing poison, consulting his will,</i>

815
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,409
<i>planning an escape with a mystery man
who was paid a handsome fee.</i>

816
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,205
And all for my benefit.

817
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,449
A convincing set of circumstances,

818
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,570
signalling your intention
to murder your husband.

819
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,609
But for two errors.

820
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,444
We must place blame
on your husband for the first.

821
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,170
If Mr Kelmot had not blundered
into Madame Schirmer's atelier...

822
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,922
<i>And so taken me from my course,</i>

823
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,250
<i>you wouldn't have had to loiter for
such a suspiciously long period of time.</i>

824
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,210
<i>But you had no choice,
so loiter you did.</i>

825
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,971
I would also make the observation
that there is nothing about you

826
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,850
that signifies the type of woman
who enjoys window shopping,

827
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,045
especially the window of a taxidermist.

828
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,081
- Was that the second error?
- No, merely confirmation of the first.

829
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,562
The second was unavoidable,
and all the more damning.

830
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,764
The man at the station.

831
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,681
Everything about him,
his clothes, the patches on his trousers,

832
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:20,369
<i>his hands, scarred and burned with acid,
announced his profession.</i>

833
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,680
Stonemason.

834
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,846
Money must have been a dire necessity,

835
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,010
else you would never have forged
your husband's signature.

836
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,089
The money was to pay for the headstones
your husband would not allow.

837
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,924
For Grace. For James.

838
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,761
For you.

839
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,491
Was arranging things to make it look
as if Mr Kelmot was the intended victim,

840
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,723
simply to keep me off the trail?

841
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,409
When I found the card...
I was furious.

842
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,684
That Thomas should know me so little

843
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,401
that he had need to employ a detective
to uncover the truth.

844
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,931
Then it struck me,

845
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,564
if anyone could understand,
it would be you.

846
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,444
Thomas thinks I'm mad
because I speak to my children.

847
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,364
He doesn't understand.

848
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,963
The dead are not so very far away.

849
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:34,767
They're just...

850
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,882
On the other side of the wall.

851
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,121
It's us, on this side,
who are, all of us so...

852
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,481
Alone?

853
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,291
I have been alone...

854
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,406
All my life.

855
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,647
But with the compensations
of the intellect.

856
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,529
- And is that enough?
- It can be.

857
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,127
If one is so fortunate
as to find a place in the world.

858
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:17,007
And another soul with whom
one's loneliness can reside.

859
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,211
Do you know a place,
where two such souls might reside?

860
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,682
It was an offer <i>unlike
any I had ever received.</i>

861
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,891
<i>She wanted to share her solitude with me.</i>

862
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,364
<i>It was only later that I realised
how fateful my decision would be.</i>

863
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,168
You have a husband who loves you.

864
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,691
Go home to him.

865
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,649
Mr Holmes...

866
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,766
You have my thanks.

867
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,328
What more, madam, could I do?

868
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,846
<i>She had poured out
the contents of the bottle.</i>

869
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,648
<i>And with no malice aforethought,
poisoned the innocent witness.</i>

870
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,202
<i>If it had been one of John's stories,</i>

871
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,282
<i>he would have called it a foreshadowing.</i>

872
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,771
<i>Our time together was fleeting.</i>

873
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,004
<i>Less than an hour, really.</i>

874
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,721
<i>Yet her death made me see
that human nature was a mystery</i>

875
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,207
<i>that logic alone could not illuminate.</i>

876
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,844
<i>I had successfully deduced
the facts of her case,</i>

877
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,366
<i>but I had failed to grasp their meaning.</i>

878
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:26,247
<i>Never had I felt such an incomprehensible
emptiness within myself.</i>

879
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,971
<i>Only then did I begin to understand
how utterly alone I was in the world.</i>

880
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,322
<i>Mrs Hudson wrote to Watson.</i>

881
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,530
<i>He came at once.</i>

882
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,971
<i>He stayed with me, in our old rooms,
for a month more.</i>

883
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,601
<i>I told him about the case,
everything in great detail.</i>

884
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,208
<i>He brought me back from the brink.</i>

885
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,843
<i>And then Watson wrote the story.</i>

886
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,206
<i>He made me the hero.</i>

887
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,651
<i>It was his way of bestowing a kindness.</i>

888
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:25,529
<i>He knew no other manner in which
to write the character he had created.</i>

889
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,085
<i>After all those years,
John didn't know me at all.</i>

890
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,530
<i>Why he took the glove I can only surmise,</i>

891
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,048
<i>was it to prevent it
becoming too powerful a reminder,</i>

892
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:42,330
<i>to keep it from being a well of sadness
to which I might return?</i>

893
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,447
<i>But he could not bring himself
to destroy it either.</i>

894
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,481
<i>After that, John and I were estranged.</i>

895
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,001
<i>Three years later, he too was gone,</i>

896
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,651
<i>without us ever having said goodbye.</i>

897
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,921
<i>And thus concludes the true story
of a woman who died before her time,</i>

898
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:22,531
<i>and a man who until recently
was certain he had outlived his.</i>

899
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,084
Roger with the bees?

900
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,881
Like as not.

901
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,610
Must tell him
something important.

902
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,971
You continue with
whatever it was you were doing.

903
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,651
You might ask him
where the watering can's got to!

904
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,926
Ambulance? Yes,
this is Headly House.

905
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,371
- Headly?
- Yes, quickly!

906
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,010
And bring some supplies of adrenaline.

907
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,160
<i>- Headly House?
- That's right, Headly!</i>

908
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,767
Roger?

909
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,161
Roger!

910
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,486
Roger?

911
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,971
Oh, Roger. Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

912
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,844
Roger. Oh, Roger!

913
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,721
Mr Holmes?

914
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,889
It's Inspector Gilbert.

915
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,566
Mr Holmes?

916
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,490
Yes, Inspector?

917
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,521
They're giving the boy injections
of adrenaline, as you said to, but...

918
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,486
He's not looking good.

919
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,447
He was fleeing his attackers.

920
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,005
His footprints.

921
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,689
Their pattern shows
that his flight was disorientated.

922
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,480
The swarm must have followed him
in their attack.

923
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,650
And before he lost consciousness,
his skin would have flushed,

924
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,371
accompanied by burning pain...

925
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,047
A drop in blood pressure, weakness.

926
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,763
His throat and mouth would be swollen

927
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,002
which explains why he didn't call for help.

928
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,728
Then a drop in heart rate...

929
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,082
Inability to breathe...

930
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,805
Shock.

931
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,202
Did you know he was allergic to bees?

932
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,962
I was certain he wasn't.

933
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,962
No, no! No, Mrs Munro, no!

934
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:37,965
You mustn't do that!

935
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,044
My son... Won't wake.

936
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,131
He may never wake.

937
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,883
They sent me away till morning.

938
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,964
You didn't even have the decency
to tell me what'd happened to him!

939
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,841
I didn't think it would make a difference.

940
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,325
I'm his mother!

941
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,130
I'm his mother...

942
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,529
And you stole him from me!

943
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,011
He's all I had!

944
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,290
And I've lost him now.

945
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,881
Why wasn't it you they did it to?

946
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,603
- It should've been you!
- The bees were not to blame.

947
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,960
They're all you care about!

948
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,724
No! I care about Roger.

949
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,771
I care about him very much.

950
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,324
The bees... Didn't do it.

951
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,280
The bees were not to blame.

952
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,842
It was the wasps!

953
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,531
Roger was trying to find out
what was killing the bees.

954
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,530
And he did. He found the wasps' nest.

955
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:03,282
He had to stop them wiping out the bees.
And so he did the worst possible thing.

956
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,205
He tried to drown them
with water from his can.

957
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,042
How do you know it was them?

958
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,845
Bees leave their stings. Wasps don't.

959
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,406
There were no stings left in Roger's face.

960
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,881
And when they attacked,
he dropped the watering can

961
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,041
and ran up to protect the bees.

962
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,448
There are his footprints
from the apiary to the nest and back.

963
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,289
He was trying to save the bees.

964
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,486
Yes.

965
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,966
Yes.

966
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,122
There was a woman, once.

967
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,889
I knew her less than a day.

968
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,442
A quarter of an hour's conversation.

969
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,044
She needed my help.

970
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,365
She needed so desperately
to be understood by someone...

971
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,690
Me.

972
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,642
So, I laid out the particulars
of her case as I saw them...

973
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,328
To her satisfaction, I thought.

974
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,362
I watched her walk away.

975
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,802
And within hours she'd ended her life.

976
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,889
By identifying the cause
of her despair with such clarity,

977
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,527
I'd given her carte blanche
to do just as she intended.

978
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,009
I should've done whatever
it took to save her.

979
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,840
Lie to her, make up a story.

980
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:07,246
Take her by the hand
and hold her as she wept,

981
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,567
and said, "Come live with me.

982
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,122
"Let us be alone together."

983
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:20,768
But I was fearful.

984
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,406
Selfish.

985
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,327
She's the reason...

986
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,368
I came here to my bees,

987
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,209
so that I couldn't harm anyone ever again.

988
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,522
I'm leaving you the house.

989
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,004
You and Roger.

990
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,882
House, grounds, apiary,
everything within and without.

991
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,521
And as I shan't change my mind
on this point, you will see, I trust,

992
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,605
that it will be greatly
less complicated for all concerned

993
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,809
if the two of you don't go off

994
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:09,407
to somewhere like... Portsmouth.

995
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,891
Mrs Munro?

996
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,931
Roger's awake.

997
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,484
Dear Mr Umezaki,

998
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:09,011
<i>I write to tell you that I have at last
recalled my meeting with your father.</i>

999
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,126
<i>A woman had died
because I failed to solve her case.</i>

1000
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:19,843
<i>Guilt and recrimination
having taken their toll on me,</i>

1001
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,491
<i>my powers were far from at their best</i>

1002
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,611
<i>when I received an urgent message</i>

1003
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,767
<i>summoning me to the Diogenes Club
to meet with my brother Mycroft.</i>

1004
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,291
This gentleman has made
an offer of service.

1005
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,684
He wishes to work for the Crown.

1006
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,128
I'm here to be tested, Mr Holmes.

1007
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,929
<i>I very much want to be of use.</i>

1008
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,004
Do you think that I am suited?

1009
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,726
I'm sure, sir.

1010
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,005
Good. There is one minor issue.

1011
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,890
Mr Umezaki has a wife and child in Japan.

1012
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,771
He wonders what would be the best course.

1013
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,286
Write a letter saying
you plan to stay on in England.

1014
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,243
Could be a long while until your return.

1015
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,963
<i>Your father went on to serve
the British Empire for many years</i>

1016
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:24,562
<i>in absolute secrecy
and with the greatest distinction,</i>

1017
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,641
from...

1018
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:40,804
The Malay... Straits...

1019
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,727
To the Arabian Sea.

1020
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,971
<i>He was a man of courage, heart and dignity,</i>

1021
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,731
<i>of whom a beloved wife and cherished son</i>

1022
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,208
may be deservedly proud.

1023
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,250
Sherlock Holmes.

1024
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,286
Hmmm.

1025
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,166
My friend John.

1026
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,564
My brother Mycroft.

1027
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,126
Mrs Hudson.

1028
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,764
Masuo Umezaki.

1029
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,929
Maya... Umezaki.

1030
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,051
Ann.

1031
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,204
And who is that one for?

1032
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,969
Me. You.

1033
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,882
Well, not yet awhile, surely?

1034
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,209
Did you finish what you had to do?

1035
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,410
Yes, I did.

1036
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,531
My first foray into the world of fiction.

1037
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,885
One shouldn't leave this life
without a sense of completion.

1038
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,811
You can use this in one of your stories.

1039
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,641
A glass, a bee...

1040
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,725
And Roger.

1041
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,005
Show me how to knock them out.

1042
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,326
Go on.

1043
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,728
- The queen runs the colony.
- Mm-hm.

1044
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,768
The drones service the queen.

1045
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,848
The workers do the work.

1046
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,883
Isn't it true?

1047
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,683
