1
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>Today marks a bleak anniversary
for our planet.</i>

2
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,858
<i>Three years ago the first case
of a global plant virus was reported,</i>

3
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,487
<i>which started to ravage
most of our ecosystems.</i>

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,061
<i>The world's leading research laboratories</i>

5
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:15,204
<i>have been trying to find a way
to stop this deadly pathogen,</i>

6
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,703
<i>but so far their efforts
have been unsuccessful.</i>

7
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,752
<i>The latest research shows that people
who consume food infected with a virus</i>

8
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:24,251
<i>develop severe autoimmune diseases.</i>

9
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,797
<i>In addition, the loss of plant life
has contributed to the concentration</i>

10
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:31,425
<i>of oxygen in the atmosphere
to decrease to 18%.</i>

11
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,302
<i>The lowest on record.</i>

12
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,305
<i>The rapidly disappearing forest
cannot recycle</i>

13
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,226
<i>enough carbon dioxide to maintain
these level for much longer.</i>

14
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,045
<i>These atmospheric changes
have caused an increase</i>

15
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,440
<i>in natural disasters around the globe.</i>

16
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,360
<i>As oxygen levels drop below 10%,</i>

17
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,362
<i>people will begin to suffocate.</i>

18
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,989
<i>Our beautiful planet Earth is doomed.</i>

19
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>But humanity still has
a chance of survival.</i>

20
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,953
<i>And their best hope is Project Gemini</i>

21
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>developed by Dr. Steven Ross.</i>

22
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,616
<i>The project centers around
an archaeological find</i>

23
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:06,705
<i>discovered eight years ago
by a group of paleontologists</i>

24
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:10,005
<i>who found two unique objects
of extraterrestrial origin.</i>

25
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,260
<i>The artifacts were estimated
to be more than four billion years old.</i>

26
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,555
Stephen Hawking once said,

27
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,183
that if humans are to survive long term,

28
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,144
we must find a way
to get off planet Earth.

29
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,189
He was optimistic
about our chances,

30
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,609
and in fact, as it turns out he was right.

31
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:35,865
These unique devices that we found
appeared on Earth before life itself.

32
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,579
We don't know what mysterious Stellar
wisdom created them and left them here,

33
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,624
but we've received this gift
on the brink of extinction.

34
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,879
We managed to recreate
this pseudo tough materials**

35
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,965
that the Sphere and the Engine
are made of.

36
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,468
And we precisely copied
both of the devices.

37
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:01,849
Now each of them has an identical twin.

38
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,769
The Warp Engine
for interstellar flights

39
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,813
has allowed us to find a planet

40
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,108
more or less suitable for terraforming.

41
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,655
The unmanned vehicle completed a jump
to the solar system TESS

42
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,076
and returned with information
and samples that confirmed our theories.

43
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,207
And this device, this Sphere,
is for creating life.

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,627
After years of research,

45
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,172
we discovered a way
to control the Sphere and the Engine.

46
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,009
These devices have their own
unique language.

47
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,304
We decoded dozens of commands,

48
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,432
each of which corresponds
to a certain pattern.

49
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,769
This pattern gave
the initial command,

50
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,389
and the Sphere began to carry out
more than four billion years now.

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,249
The Sphere uses chemical elements
from the environment

52
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,669
and creates a true miracle:

53
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,754
life!

54
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,217
Now we know life on Earth
was created by this machine.

55
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:22,346
The Sphere is our starting point.

56
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,685
Let me introduce you to our team
of leading research scientists.

57
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,942
Our team consists of:
Dr. Peter Lehmann,

58
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,028
a specialist in extraterrestrial
Warp Engine.

59
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,656
Doctor Leona Redwood,

60
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,117
a terraforming program builder.

61
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,414
Today we are joined
by military trained pilots,

62
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,541
headed by Major Ryan Connor.

63
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,005
We are departing
for the solar system TESS,

64
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,258
several hundred
light years from here.

65
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:03,303
We will bring The Sphere to a planet

66
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,973
that has the right conditions.

67
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,434
And we'll create

68
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,894
Earth 2.0,

69
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,731
a new home for humanity.

70
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,724
What do you think, Peter?

71
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,311
Whoever created this, where are they now?

72
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,105
There's not enough data to say.

73
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,151
And I don't really like speculating
about stuff like this.

74
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,279
This isn't about the speculation.
It's a theory.

75
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,492
Maybe it was
a lost civilization.

76
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,120
We know from experience
how highly-developed civilizations

77
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,831
are good at self-destruction.

78
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,417
-Who knows?
-Yeah.

79
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,030
Well, another giant leap
for humanity, eh, guys?

80
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,577
Only this time literally,
for the first time in history.

81
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,111
Just as long as something
more than a bunch of atoms

82
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,057
makes it to the destination…

83
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,667
It still counts.

84
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,004
Say it. For the first time in history.

85
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,636
Attention! And prepare for a jump.

86
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,546
All systems are ready.

87
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,382
The coordinates are set.

88
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,760
Warp Drive set at maximum power.

89
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,969
Ready?

90
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,474
Engage.

91
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,224
<i>Critical error.</i>

92
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,394
<i>Critical error.</i>

93
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,022
<i>Critical error.</i>

94
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,234
<i>Critical error.</i>

95
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,855
Where are we?

96
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,239
Is this TESS?

97
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,997
Richard, did we complete the maneuver?

98
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:10,957
Yes, we did.

99
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,461
Star maps…
They don't match up.

100
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,380
It's not TESS.

101
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,597
What coordinates
did you put in?

102
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,017
Are you sure they were operational?

103
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,686
Of course, sir.

104
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,647
Did you check the Engine?

105
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,733
Everything was done according to protocol.

106
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,611
If everything was done to protocol,

107
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,488
we'd be in TESS right now.

108
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,282
The mission failed, Peter.

109
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,326
There is no hope for Earth now.

110
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,705
-Permission to check the Engine.
-No.

111
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,624
You are relieved of your duties.

112
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,460
Stay in your bunk until I say otherwise.

113
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,553
Yes, sir.

114
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,784
What's this?

115
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:14,497
In physics,
there is an equation…

116
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,916
The Dirac equation.

117
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,962
When two particles
come into contact,

118
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,882
they become bound forever.

119
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,344
They continue to "feel" one another,

120
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,764
even if they are light years apart.

121
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,559
It's called quantum entanglement.

122
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,605
That's physics for you?

123
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,026
Not just physics.

124
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,772
Try de-set the jump trajectory.

125
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,775
Maybe it will help us
figure out where we are.

126
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,195
No, Steve.
The trajectory is not clear.

127
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,532
The data doesn't make any sense at all.

128
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,909
We've entered the fourth dimension,

129
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,496
But it's almost as if we moved along
the coordinates axis that we can't access.

130
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,916
And then we jumped back
into three-dimensional space.

131
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,712
But where?

132
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,065
Is there anything around us
that can help us figure out our location?

133
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,486
No, no land marks.
Nothing even remotely familiar.

134
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,949
We have no point to set a return jump.

135
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,368
So that means

136
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,621
that until we figure out
where we are we can't get back.

137
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,998
No.

138
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,877
<i>Repair airlock is open.</i>

139
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,240
What's that?

140
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,670
The repair airlock
of the Engine compartment is open.

141
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,635
Why? And who is there?

142
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,850
Repair airlock, this is
the captain calling. Airlock, report.

143
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,519
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

144
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,317
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

145
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,281
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

146
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,287
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

147
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,834
<i>Unidentified object approaching.</i>

148
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,643
Shit!

149
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,584
I can't believe it.

150
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,585
Calm down, Leona.

151
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,214
We gotta keep our cool
if we wanna survive.

152
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,259
We are already a man down.

153
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,848
Peter ignored Steve's orders,
went to the Engine compartment,

154
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,727
realised what he'd done,
and that was the end.

155
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,523
Peter wouldn't have.

156
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,818
I knew him.

157
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,904
I worked with him for eight years.

158
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,574
He couldn't given up so easily.

159
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,158
Leona, enough.

160
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,161
How can you defend him?

161
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,291
Now we have to deal
with the results of his mistakes.

162
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,418
Do his work for him.

163
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,964
One person put multiple lives in danger.

164
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,552
He almost destroyed
humanity's only chance of survival.

165
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,054
That's who you should be crying for?

166
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,008
After Rita died
I didn't wanna live anymore.

167
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,721
But then I thought,
instead of ending it all

168
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,307
I could make it mean something.

169
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,520
So I decided
to devote myself to the mission.

170
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,232
But now it turns out

171
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:39,197
that I'm less useful
here than on Earth.

172
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,828
David…

173
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,917
Everything will be all right.
We'll find a way out this.

174
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,963
The future of Earth
depends on our mission.

175
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,173
Giving up is not an option.

176
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,555
We need to establish
what part of the universe we're in.

177
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,058
-Richard, do you have anything?
-Not yet.

178
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,104
I'm tracking the moving trajectories
of the nearest stars and planets.

179
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,732
I'll try to calculate
our position from there.

180
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,236
David, what about that planet?

181
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,406
Any data on the probe?

182
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,701
Just loaded.

183
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,372
Great.

184
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,917
The surface of the planet
is made of volcanic rock.

185
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,004
There is no biosphere.

186
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,590
There is an atmosphere,
but without oxygen.

187
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,552
The average temperature
is 16 degrees Celsius.

188
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,015
The outside environment isn't aggressive.

189
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,726
All we'll need are breathing masks.

190
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,440
It's perfect.

191
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,819
If I could choose
between TESS and this planet,

192
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,113
I'd go here.

193
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,706
Do you realize how lucky we are?

194
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:16,169
What was the likelihood of winding up
near planet that's perfect for the Sphere?

195
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,212
What if this isn't an accident?

196
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,798
What if we were brought here on purpose?

197
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,386
-By whom?
-The same thing that left us the Sphere.

198
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,348
-Ryan, get ready to disembark.
-What do you mean?

199
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,435
We can complete our mission
on this planet.

200
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,771
But we haven't examined it.

201
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,565
But this is our chance.

202
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,718
If we launch the Sphere on this planet

203
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,051
we'll have enough time
to understand where we are.

204
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,697
Then, other ships come repeat our job.

205
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,869
Richard, prepare the lander
to go down to the planet.

206
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,580
But it's a young planet,
the atmosphere is unstable.

207
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,082
We don't know anything about it.

208
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,667
It might not be safe
to make a surface landing.

209
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,046
I agree, you're recklessly risking
the safety of the crew.

210
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,547
And I'm against it.

211
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,093
Thankfully, I am the one
who makes the final decisions.

212
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,346
No, Steve. It's too early
for decisions like these.

213
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,265
I said we are landing.

214
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,352
Richard, show in the landing area.

215
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,312
You'll land here, in the valley.

216
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,232
The weather conditions
for descent are optimal.

217
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,734
We're ready.
Initiate un-docking procedure.

218
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,821
<i>Un-docking sequence initiated.</i>

219
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,743
<i>Engine's activated.</i>

220
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,329
<i>The height is 30,000 meters. Coming down.</i>

221
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,180
A storm front is heading your way.

222
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,725
<i>It formed a few minutes ago.
Couldn't have predicted it.</i>

223
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,144
<i>The winds are up to 40 meters per second.</i>

224
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:24,106
So hold on.
Activating braking thrusters.

225
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,028
What the hell was that?

226
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,364
<i>- What's going on?</i>
-It's the wind.

227
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,532
The storm is quite aggressive.

228
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,580
The descent is twice as high
as the landing speed. We're falling.

229
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,582
We're gonna crush into surface.

230
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,502
I can double the thrust.
It will slow your fall.

231
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,589
<i>If we use that we won't have a fuel
for the return flight!</i>

232
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,593
If we don't, we will die!

233
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,471
The temperature is too extreme.
Your hole is melting.

234
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,807
Damn it!
Release the first tank.

235
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,446
I'll try to slow you down aerodynamically.

236
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,365
I hope the hole holds up.

237
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,130
<i>Hold on.
We are coming in on it!</i>

238
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,298
<i>Brace for impact!</i>

239
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,944
Amy…

240
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,747
Amy, why did you fly off to?

241
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,667
I need you.

242
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,428
I got you something.

243
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,347
What's this?

244
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,475
We've been together for a year.

245
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,188
You know, The Sphere means a lot to me,

246
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,231
but not as much as you do.

247
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,153
Obviously, I know
you two don't get along.

248
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,531
So I thought to create
something to connect you both.

249
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,742
It's made out of the old Sphere.

250
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,162
There was a fragment
that really stood out.

251
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,499
It's so beautiful. Thank you.

252
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,418
I thought it would be symbolic.

253
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,547
The Sphere is our salvation,

254
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,424
and you are mine.

255
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,725
Let's go home. The sprinklers
are about to start spraying.

256
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,520
Let's stay for a while.

257
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,741
-What's the status on the lander?
<i>- No critical damage.</i>

258
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,287
<i>But it's almost out of fuel.</i>

259
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,793
Now we can't get back to the ship,
we're stuck here.

260
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:17,298
Why go back to the ship?
Our plan was to come back in four years.

261
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,509
And now our main task
is to install and launch the Sphere.

262
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,261
We're continuing the program.

263
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,054
But we can't carry it out now.

264
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:28,142
We strayed too far away from
the landing site, into the mountains.

265
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,979
That means there should be caves here.

266
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:36,233
But it's impossible to deploy
domes on this terrain.

267
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,529
We'll manage without domes.
A deep enough cave

268
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,282
will provide the right amount
of protection for the Sphere.

269
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,910
There! This cave looks suitable.

270
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,746
It's big enough and easy to access.

271
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,998
Leona, you get the data
on seismic activity,

272
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,625
David, adjust the program.

273
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,835
Everyone else, check the equipment.

274
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,464
Get to work, people,
what are you waiting for?

275
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,988
Conditions on this planet
are even better than we expected.

276
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,283
Other ships will arrive here soon.

277
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,245
A new history of mankind begins here,

278
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,997
at this very minute.

279
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,159
We did it! I can't believe it.

280
00:33:56,452 --> 00:34:00,080
Peter would be so happy.
He worked so hard for this.

281
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,790
<i>Captain, you need to see this.</i>

282
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,041
He should be here.

283
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,461
Okay, attention, team.

284
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,421
We're returning to base.

285
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:10,758
Move out.

286
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,807
David, do you have any data?

287
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,395
Not yet.

288
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:30,569
Doctor Ross, martial laws
are in effect on this station.

289
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,156
What? Why?

290
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,158
We have new information.

291
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,367
Richard?

292
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,620
Starting playback.

293
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,093
<i>This is Dr. Peter Lehmann.</i>

294
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,640
<i>Against all orders, I will personally
conduct an Engine inspection.</i>

295
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,001
<i>I'm now recording all of my actions</i>

296
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,447
<i>so I'm not accused of tampering
with the results.</i>

297
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,607
<i>The security cameras are switched off
so that I am not interrupted.</i>

298
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,943
<i>I'm not gonna be a scapegoat.</i>

299
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,655
<i>I'm gonna prove that I made no mistake.</i>

300
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:03,036
<i>Help!</i>

301
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,258
What was that?

302
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,596
Some kind of a life form?

303
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,098
Was that what killed Peter?

304
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,899
<i>I watched all of the recordings
from the cameras.</i>

305
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:28,099
<i>It shows up by the Sphere
for the first time</i>

306
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,996
<i>right after we left Earth.</i>

307
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,608
This thing crawled out of the Sphere?

308
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,278
Straight outta the story
of the Trojan horse.

309
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,241
<i>And that Trojan climbed right into
the Engine just before the jump.</i>

310
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,037
So maybe it caused the failure?

311
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:50,709
Richard, if that Trojan
is still on the ship, you're in danger.

312
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,837
No. He went down with you,

313
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,505
<i>into the Sphere.</i>

314
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,633
<i>We can track its position.</i>

315
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,886
It causes interference
in the electromagnetic field.

316
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,164
<i>Here's the video from the cameras
right before the landing.</i>

317
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,518
I've got the first data from the cave.

318
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,646
Something's strange. Steve?

319
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:21,698
Levels of CO2 and oxidation
inside the Sphere are rising,

320
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,910
but there aren't any bio markers.

321
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,329
What? Could it be a malfunction?

322
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,748
No, it's working in a full capacity.

323
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,168
Just on the different program
than the one we've uploaded.

324
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,879
It's doing something else.

325
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,006
Regroup.

326
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,259
We're going back to the Sphere.
We need to adjust the settings.

327
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,803
Nobody's going anywhere, Steve.

328
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,183
We'll adjust the settings later,
after we deal with the threat.

329
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,853
But Steve is the head of the project,
he calls the shots.

330
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,563
Not anymore.

331
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,609
Now it's a question of the crew survival.

332
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:00,404
Steve, I'm taking command,
you're being relieved.

333
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,740
You can't do that.

334
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,660
The future of mankind
depends on this mission.

335
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,870
Only Dr. Ross can carry it out.

336
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,290
Are you sure that Dr. Ross
is giving us all the information

337
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,918
about what the Sphere actually is?

338
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,629
What are you talking about?

339
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,382
Richard, show the video from the cave.

340
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,186
Steve saw the anomaly.

341
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,648
And didn't say anything to anyone

342
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,317
<i>risking the lives of the entire crew.</i>

343
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:45,073
-Where did it come from?
-Right from the Sphere.

344
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,328
Which as it turns out
we know too little about.

345
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,707
What if it's an incubator
for those monsters?

346
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:59,421
I didn't hide a single confirmed fact
about the Sphere from you.

347
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:04,217
And there was no sense
in discussing anomalies.

348
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,429
If we had known about these anomalies,

349
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,557
we would have treated
the Sphere differently,

350
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,727
and Peter would be alive right now.

351
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,343
David, I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

352
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,805
It's okay.

353
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,682
I understand how busy you are.

354
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,103
Yes, we don't have much time to spare.

355
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,521
Why are you here?

356
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,026
The doctor says I'm fine.
Gave me a clean bill of health.

357
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,154
So I'm ready to join everyone
for the pre-launch.

358
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,073
What?

359
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,450
I mean you…

360
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,162
You're actually planning to fly?

361
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,874
But you are the one who made me
a member of the crew.

362
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,543
But that was…

363
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,461
before…

364
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,256
Before Rita died?

365
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,509
So what?
I'm telling you the psychologist

366
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,511
has confirmed I'm okay.

367
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,347
But to lose a daughter…

368
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,183
David, I'm terribly sorry.

369
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,728
I understand you want to get back to work

370
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,106
but this is not the best way.

371
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,609
Right now you need time to grief.

372
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,696
Steve, I'm not flying
to forget my daughter.

373
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,073
She'll always be a part of me.

374
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,661
I know the Sphere as well as you do.

375
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,204
And you'll need me there.

376
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,123
David, listen,

377
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,251
all I'm doing is looking out for you.

378
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,711
What?

379
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,755
You're crossing my name off?

380
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,760
After all we've done
you're going to leave me on the sidelines?

381
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,600
I can help you change the future.

382
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,853
Don't take that away from me.

383
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,040
-What?
-We can't leave it like that.

384
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:43,627
We have to go back to the cave
and restore the settings.

385
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:47,172
-But Ryan gave orders.
-Just you and me.

386
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,050
We'll go out quietly.

387
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:55,513
Whatever killed Peter is still in there.

388
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,059
The Trojan is 30 kilometers away
from the cave right now,

389
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,311
that means if it decides to come back

390
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:03,840
we'll have at least
half an hour to get out.

391
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,815
-What about Ryan?
-Ryan's too careful.

392
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,360
He's wasting time.

393
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,863
Lost days are lost lives.

394
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:17,702
When Rita was dying,
you slowly died with her.

395
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,622
I saw what that was like.

396
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:26,544
Now imagine that entire planet
is dying the exact same way.

397
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:31,800
Slowly, irreversibly,
from the same virus.

398
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,859
What the hell is this?

399
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,653
What's going on?

400
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,699
The Sphere did this.

401
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,576
-You think it was a malfunction?
-Not just a malfunction

402
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,830
The Sphere is creating an alien life form.

403
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,999
And incredibly quickly.

404
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,584
Faster than it created life on Earth.

405
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,547
We shouldn't touch it.
We need to discuss this with everybody.

406
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,590
We need to set a plan of action.

407
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,468
Someone readjusted
the settings on the Sphere.

408
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,518
The Trojan's getting closer,
we gotta leave.

409
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:24,644
Just a minute.

410
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:25,812
Can't you hear me?

411
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,398
There's no point in risking our lives!
Let's go!

412
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:29,983
Get away from me, dammit!

413
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:42,120
-Have you lost your mind?
-It's over! The mission is over!

414
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,413
Deal with it!

415
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,667
The Sphere is hostile!

416
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,172
Put the gun down, David! Put it down!

417
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,050
You wanna die
because of this piece of shit?

418
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,013
Too late, it's already here.

419
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:39,529
<i>Airlock closed.
Pressurization completed.</i>

420
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,873
You're a psycho, Steve.
Because of you, we both almost died.

421
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:58,882
This is not about us.
We have to complete the mission.

422
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,636
If you had damaged the Sphere
all of this would've been for nothing.

423
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:07,140
Then you should've shot me.
Why didn't you?

424
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,688
If you threaten the mission one more time

425
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,773
I will.

426
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:27,410
Steve, what the hell were you doing?
Where were you?

427
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,330
Why did you leave the lander
against my orders?

428
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,291
We did what we had to.

429
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,051
You no longer have the right
to make decisions.

430
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,889
I make the decisions I find necessary.

431
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,265
Or what?

432
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,976
What are you gonna do?
Use force?

433
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,729
Then go ahead! Well?

434
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:55,980
Come on!

435
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,907
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

436
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,118
What did you do?

437
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:11,120
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

438
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,834
<i>Module integrity compromised.</i>

439
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,216
Quiet, sweetie.

440
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,928
We're so close I'm losing my head.

441
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,555
What's that?

442
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,725
Trojan's in the lander.

443
00:48:56,643 --> 00:49:00,188
Got a hole in the lower deck,
everything's covered in this shit.

444
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:02,148
So what do we do now?

445
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,945
Quietly, and slowly. Let's go.

446
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:22,960
It's hard to breathe.

447
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,448
Get back.

448
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,450
What? Why?

449
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,787
It's here.

450
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,392
Run!

451
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,832
What's happened?
Are you okay?

452
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,917
The Trojan…

453
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,836
The Trojan's in the laboratory.

454
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,089
Do you realize what you've done?

455
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,674
You brought it down here with you!

456
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,989
-Can it get in here?
-We don't know.

457
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,451
It damaged the generator
and the cameras aren't working.

458
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,787
We've lost contact with the ship, so…

459
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,289
We have no video from space.

460
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,460
Here's the last video saved on the system.

461
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,879
It was looking
for a weak spot in the hull.

462
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,176
It got in through the cooling system.

463
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,386
Where the steel is thinnest.

464
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,807
So this thing is smart?
It can think?

465
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,059
Whether it can think or not,

466
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:47,688
if we smoke it out and with the hole shut
it can't crawl back in.

467
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,690
But how? How can we smoke it out?

468
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,734
We can't even see where it is.

469
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:56,239
We have to restore the security cameras
and communications.

470
00:51:56,823 --> 00:52:01,494
The Trojan damaged the main generator,
but the life support system is working.

471
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,247
That means the back up generator is fine.

472
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:07,875
We can connect the network
and cameras to it.

473
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,668
We will have to make
all the way blind to the fuse box

474
00:52:10,768 --> 00:52:13,530
with no idea where that bastard is.
It's too risky.

475
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,760
It's all my fault.

476
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,096
So I'll go.

477
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,267
I'll watch your six.

478
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:38,651
Steve,

479
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:40,319
<i>you need to get out of there, now!</i>

480
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,335
Are you hurt?

481
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,551
How's the signal and the cameras?

482
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,637
All there. Back online.

483
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,892
Damn it! It's transmitting an EMP field
stronger than the Sphere.

484
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,352
The electronics next to it
are going crazy.

485
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,021
So what now?

486
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:03,571
Have you ever seen a raging bull
running after the crowds

487
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:05,873
down a narrow passage
just before a bull fight?

488
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,408
The bull wants to catch the runners,

489
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,912
but he ends up in the arena
with the matador.

490
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:17,124
The Trojan is the bull.
It also wants to catch us.

491
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:22,421
We have a chance to lead it
wherever we want, like outside the lander.

492
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,049
It's a huge risk for everyone,

493
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,468
but it's all worth it.

494
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:39,105
The lander has two airlocks:

495
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,525
the central one, and the one in the lab.

496
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,654
I'll be outside
in front of the open central hatch.

497
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,031
I'll be the main decoy.

498
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:54,203
The Trojan will chase me
along the corridors.

499
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:59,708
Once we get outside, you'll shut
the engines to the airlock behind it.

500
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,297
Understood?

501
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:05,673
But in order to do all that,
we need to get to the airlocks.

502
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,967
And that's where the Trojan is.

503
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,679
We can isolate it
in the main corridor, here.

504
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,973
The inner doors won't hold on long,

505
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,809
but should buy us some time.

506
00:57:19,162 --> 00:57:22,148
<i>I'll lure him into the inter-hatch space.
And lock him in</i>

507
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:41,310
<i>After the Trojan is blocked, each one
of us will report to a specific location.</i>

508
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,272
<i>David, you and I will open
the air hatch in the labs.</i>

509
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:47,738
<i>You'll wait for me there,</i>

510
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:52,029
<i>while I'll go outside
to be the bait for the Trojan.</i>

511
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,990
But in order for the Trojan
to see me and come out

512
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:59,370
both sides of the airlock
have to be open,

513
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,580
outside and inside.

514
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:05,584
That's why Leona
will manually open the airlock

515
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:09,088
and hide right here,
in the technical bay.

516
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:46,583
<i>When the Trojan comes after me,
it will run over here,</i>

517
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,461
<i>past the Engine's steering nozzles.</i>

518
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,380
<i>There should be some fuel left.</i>

519
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,925
<i>And if we turn the Engine
at the right moment</i>

520
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,637
<i>we won't just smoke it out,
we'll roast it.</i>

521
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,432
<i>Get out of here, you fucking bastard!</i>

522
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:04,101
<i>Hurry! It won't hold up much longer!</i>

523
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,854
Don't panic. Release the Trojan.

524
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,023
Hide in the tech bay.

525
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,607
You can do it.

526
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,050
<i>I'm turning on the Engine.</i>

527
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,385
It's not working.
The Trojan is messing with the system.

528
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:40,012
Steve, run!

529
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,690
The Engine's on.

530
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,901
Leona, get out! Get out!

531
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,629
<i>Ryan, the airlock!
Shut the airlock!</i>

532
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:21,929
Shit!

533
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,742
Rest in peace, Frank.

534
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,481
A part of its tentacle was cut off
by the door. It returned to the cave.

535
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,614
<i>Pressurization complete.</i>

536
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,534
<i>Oxygen level returning to normal.</i>

537
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,416
It won't get back in here.

538
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,835
But the Sphere is under its control.

539
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,588
Not for long.

540
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:46,930
Amy.

541
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,475
What is it?

542
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,145
It's the virus…

543
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,858
It's already in our home, literally.

544
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:02,654
You shouldn't go on this mission.

545
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:06,033
Amy, what are you talking about?
We discussed everything.

546
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,537
You've done enough.
This isn't your mission.

547
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,208
-Excuse me?
-You're not even an astronaut.

548
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:20,714
You want me

549
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,051
to walk out a week before the launch?

550
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,969
What's gotten into you?

551
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,310
We're going to have a baby.

552
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,025
What?

553
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,153
Just stay.

554
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,949
We'll work on the vaccine.
I found a promising pathway.

555
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:51,119
The mission will create a new Earth
but we could save this one.

556
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,559
This is my blueprint for the vaccine,
please go over it.

557
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:56,367
I'm really happy.

558
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,378
But it's such poor timing.

559
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,465
I won't get to see him grow up.

560
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,387
Steve, I'm begging you.
Please, stay with me. Stay with us.

561
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,848
I can't, I have to be there. I have to.

562
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,809
You've done everything you could.

563
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:16,895
We can develop the vaccine now.
I think I'm onto something.

564
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,065
I need to save the Earth.

565
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,744
We have to study this creature,

566
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:44,524
so we can understand
what you're infected with.

567
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,730
My guess, it's a bio-robot.

568
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:18,624
These are the same materials
the Sphere is made of.

569
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:32,262
And they also change their properties
when they come into contact with water.

570
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:36,558
We studied it never understanding

571
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:41,229
that one of its functions
was to create a Trojan.

572
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,608
Maybe they are much more advanced
than we are.

573
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,819
And better.

574
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,921
David, listen…

575
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:11,760
Tell me what you found.

576
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,683
The bacteria that infected you

577
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:22,938
have an unusually powerful
defense mechanism.

578
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,116
I studied them.

579
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,159
Figured out how they work.

580
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:40,330
This is what we spent
all those years searching for.

581
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:47,177
Your blood holds the key
to the vaccine against the virus

582
01:06:47,816 --> 01:06:49,715
that's been destroying life on Earth.

583
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,843
It doesn't change anything.

584
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,803
Don't you understand?

585
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:57,305
We can save the world.

586
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:02,060
And it's all because of you.
You are the real hero.

587
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,401
I'll administer some painkillers,
you'll feel better.

588
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,036
Here goes nothing…

589
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,527
What was that?

590
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,073
David…

591
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,701
It's a transponder.

592
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:46,248
We can see the connections
of the Sphere.

593
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,878
This is their way
of colonizing planets.

594
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,089
<i>How's it going?</i>

595
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:57,551
<i>It's a bio-robot.</i>

596
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,136
<i>We have to find
a way to destroy it</i>

597
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,430
and restore the settings in the Sphere.

598
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:07,102
<i>No, Steve. Too many people
have died because of you already.</i>

599
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:11,773
<i>Wait. What did you do?</i>

600
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:15,652
<i>Did you lock me in?</i>

601
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,529
<i>You are under arrest, Steve.</i>

602
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,198
<i>Ryan,</i>

603
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,617
<i>we have to work together.</i>

604
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,453
<i>For Peter, and Frank and Leona.</i>

605
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,998
<i>Otherwise they all died in vain--</i>

606
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,584
<i>People are expendable to you.</i>

607
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,254
<i>Ryan! Ryan!</i>

608
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,883
He's right.

609
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:50,228
It was never the salvation of humanity
that was most important to you, Steve.

610
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,315
You always wanna play the hero.

611
01:09:55,567 --> 01:10:00,030
And now you just want to win and you
don't care about other people's lives.

612
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,605
Amy, talk to me.

613
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:44,366
I read your proposal.
It looks truly promising.

614
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:47,494
A real breakthrough.

615
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,331
A chance to create a vaccine.
Finally, a real one.

616
01:10:57,212 --> 01:11:00,382
But I do need to go.
For our sake.

617
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:06,304
I don't know what I'll do without you

618
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,724
but I promise I'll come back.

619
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,937
I need you.

620
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,232
Both of you.

621
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:25,448
Tell him…

622
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,410
or her…

623
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:34,207
that Daddy like a God
is out creating the new Earth.

624
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:41,006
You keep saying
you're doing this to save everyone.

625
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:43,341
But who is everyone?

626
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,969
You don't see people around you.

627
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:51,224
All you care about is you
and your project. Why even bother?

628
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,602
To be the hailed a savior? Is that it?

629
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:02,986
To save our future.

630
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:09,951
I wonder what it is
you're really trying to save.

631
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:42,442
Richard, you modeled the trajectories
of the nearest stars?

632
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,862
That didn't give us anything.
What do you think you'll find there?

633
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,421
You said that when we made the jump

634
01:12:48,521 --> 01:12:51,951
we moved along a coordinate axis
that was inaccessible to us.

635
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,163
And what if that axis wasn't spatial?

636
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,668
Show us how these stars will look

637
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:04,464
accounting the expansion of the universe
over four billion years.

638
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,927
<i>Yes, recalculating.</i>

639
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,276
We didn't move in space.

640
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,446
We moved in time.

641
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,366
It's Ursa Major.

642
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,077
And Orion.

643
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,122
And there's the North Star…

644
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:39,624
and our…

645
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:43,628
Sun?

646
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,015
And the Earth was silent and empty,

647
01:13:57,308 --> 01:14:00,520
and the darkness over the abyss.

648
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,484
That means that we're on Earth?

649
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,155
Before the beginning of life itself?

650
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,584
About four billion years ago.

651
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,671
How did you figure that out?

652
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,848
This is the fragment
that flew off the Sphere

653
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,558
when David fired at it.

654
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,187
Here is the broken fragment.

655
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:46,983
And here is the same piece
on the bracelet I made for Amy.

656
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,366
Because it's the exact same fragment.

657
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,914
The Sphere here and the old one on Earth

658
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,459
are the exact same Sphere,

659
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,837
but in different times.

660
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,342
Some civilization sent the Sphere on Earth

661
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:15,511
to create a biosphere suitable for them.

662
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,014
But something went wrong.

663
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,017
But that means no matter what we do here,

664
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,021
we won't save the people on Earth?

665
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,607
There's only one option left,

666
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,194
tell Amy about those
extraterrestrial bacteria

667
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:34,322
and help her to create the vaccine.

668
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:37,200
How do you plan to do that?

669
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:43,581
We know that the Sphere will remain
in the cave until our time.

670
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:51,506
And that I will make this fragment
into a bracelet for Amy.

671
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,720
I'll write her a message
telling her how to connect the Spheres.

672
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,483
But Amy had the bracelet before we left.

673
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,318
And she didn't say anything about it.

674
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,364
I believe Amy will miss me.

675
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,752
She will come for the bracelet,

676
01:16:20,169 --> 01:16:23,037
and sooner or later
she will see these inscriptions.

677
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,624
What's left is to put the part back

678
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,376
and reconfigure the system.

679
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,963
Or the life that we ​​know

680
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,632
will never appear.

681
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:37,385
Neither will humanity.

682
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:18,736
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

683
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:21,406
Ryan is planning on blowing up the Sphere.

684
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:23,866
Connect me to him.

685
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:27,870
He switched off his radio.

686
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,247
You need to find him

687
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:30,706
<i>and explain everything.</i>

688
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,918
<i>Go, I've re-opened the airlock.</i>

689
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:05,366
Stop right there.

690
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,203
Ryan…

691
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:14,750
The Sphere is our only chance.

692
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:17,462
Don't even try.

693
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,591
Okay. Okay.

694
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,302
But your plan still won't work.

695
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:28,514
It will.

696
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:30,850
You'll see.

697
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,479
You want to take the bomb to the cave,

698
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:40,151
wait for the Trojan there
and blow it up along with the Sphere.

699
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,279
But what if it attacks you on the way?

700
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,117
Then I will go up

701
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,870
in smoke with him.

702
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:53,706
And you will lose.

703
01:19:55,333 --> 01:20:00,379
After all, the Sphere will continue
to create the environment

704
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,215
that the Trojan needs.

705
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:07,512
What do you suggest?
You got a better idea?

706
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,014
Let's lure in the Trojan,

707
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:12,183
into the lander,

708
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:16,604
lock the airlocks and blow it up.

709
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:18,189
Here.

710
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,029
David, why?

711
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:27,865
For Rita.

712
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,579
-She died.
-She hasn't died yet.

713
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,625
-You're deranged.
-I'm not.

714
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,257
After what have happened
in the cave, I understand.

715
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:53,792
The Trojan didn't kill me,

716
01:20:54,921 --> 01:21:00,259
and it doesn't do anything
without a reason.

717
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,612
It chose me.

718
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:10,074
And I will help it.

719
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,619
We weren't supposed to be here.

720
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,371
We're a mistake.

721
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:20,042
And you are the one
who helped me understand that.

722
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:31,887
I realized that we all
are just like you, Steve.

723
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,223
We weren't created right.

724
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,560
We're a malfunction of the Sphere.

725
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,523
But I will fix it.

726
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:45,985
David, wake up!

727
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:48,070
You can't help Rita like that!

728
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,325
She wouldn't be born to suffer,

729
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,620
and she will not die at the age of eight.

730
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,576
No ones else will suffer, Steve,

731
01:21:58,676 --> 01:22:02,080
because there will never be
any people to begin with.

732
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:14,972
People deserve a chance, David.

733
01:22:16,057 --> 01:22:17,642
People don't change.

734
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,418
<i>Encounter to Mission.</i>

735
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:56,670
Encounter to Mission.

736
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:02,343
Encounter to Mission.
Encounter to Mission.

737
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:05,638
Come in, Mission.

738
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:08,766
Come on, guys.

739
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,393
Encounter to Mission….

740
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:15,898
<i>Encounter to Mission.</i>

741
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:19,985
<i>Encounter to Mission!</i>

742
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:24,531
<i>Encounter to Mission!</i>

743
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,661
<i>Encounter to Mission!</i>

01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:32,790
Richard.

745
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,334
Steve! Thank God!

746
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,753
I saw the explosion on camera.

747
01:27:37,878 --> 01:27:40,089
<i>-I thought you were all…</i>
-The Trojan's been destroyed.

748
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:46,553
-What about Ryan?
<i>-He didn't make it.</i>

749
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:58,190
<i>Steve, your oxygen levels are dropping.</i>

750
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,443
Looks like some shrapnel pierced the tank.

751
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:05,906
-How much time do I have?
<i>-About an hour.</i>

752
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:10,285
<i>Look, I'll land the ship and pick you up.</i>

753
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:14,123
No, there's a storm here. You'll crash.

754
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:17,209
And what are you gonna do?

755
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:21,296
<i>I'm going to the cave.
I need to contact Amy.</i>

756
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:25,134
Land the ship
as soon as the storm settles down.

757
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,053
Godspeed, Steve.

758
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,241
Please start working.

759
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:12,551
Steve!

760
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,642
Amy?

761
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:31,361
Steve!

762
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,156
Where are you?

763
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:38,827
-I'm somewhere in the distant past.
-What do you mean?

764
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:43,749
We don't have much time.
I know how to save the Earth.

765
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,168
You were on the right path.

766
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:50,339
There's a mechanism
that can help us create the vaccine.

767
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,467
I saw it here with my own eyes.

768
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,596
-Can you write something down?
-Sure. Sure.

769
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:04,501
You have to teach the plant cells

770
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:08,023
to quickly identify
any mutation of the virus.

771
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,692
Here's the antigen formula.

772
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,487
Amy, I promised
I'd come back to see you.

773
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:15,739
I'm so sorry.

774
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:22,788
-No. Steve…
-I only regret one thing…

775
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:28,752
That I'll never hold you again

776
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:32,923
and our child.

777
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:37,511
We're connected, remember?

778
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,598
You'll always be with me. With us.

779
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:58,824
I love you. Both of you.

780
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:12,671
Steve.

781
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:16,383
I love you.

782
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,219
Steve…

783
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:29,956
<i>The Earth, O Lord,
is full of God mercy.</i>

784
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:33,335
<i>Teach me thy statutes.</i>

785
01:34:34,086 --> 01:34:36,421
<i>Teach me good judgment and knowledge.</i>

786
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:40,384
<i>Before I was afflicted I went astray.</i>

787
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:43,553
<i>But now have I kept thy word.</i>

788
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,433
<i>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.</i>

789
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:53,188
<i>Let thy tender mercies come unto me,</i>

790
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:57,317
<i>that I may live.</i>

791
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:02,538
﻿今天是我们星球惨淡的周年纪念日。

792
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,958
三年前，报告了首例全球植物病毒病例，

793
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,587
这开始破坏我们的大部分生态系统。

794
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,161
世界领先的研究实验室

795
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:15,304
一直在努力寻找阻止这种致命病原体的方法，

796
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:17,803
但到目前为止，他们的努力没有成功。

797
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,852
最新研究表明，食用被病毒感染的食物的人

798
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:24,351
发展为严重的自身免疫性疾病。

799
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,897
此外，植物生命的丧失也导致了集中

800
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:31,525
大气中的氧气含量降至 18%。

801
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,402
有记录以来最低。

802
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,405
迅速消失的森林无法循环利用

803
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:40,326
足够的二氧化碳来维持这些水平更长的时间。

804
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,145
这些大气变化导致增加

805
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:46,540
在世界各地的自然灾害中。

806
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:49,460
当氧气含量降至 10% 以下时，

807
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,462
人们将开始窒息。

808
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,089
我们美丽的地球注定要毁灭。

809
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,800
但人类仍有生存的机会。

810
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:59,053
他们最大的希望是双子座计划

811
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,221
由 Steven Ross 博士开发。

812
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,716
该项目以考古发现为中心

813
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:06,805
八年前由一群古生物学家发现

814
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:10,105
他发现了两个独特的外星物体。

815
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:14,360
这些文物估计有超过四十亿年的历史。

816
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:17,655
斯蒂芬霍金曾经说过，

817
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,283
如果人类要长期生存，

818
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,244
我们必须找到离开地球的方法。

819
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:27,289
他对我们的机会持乐观态度，

820
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,709
事实上，事实证明他是对的。

821
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:35,965
我们发现的这些独特设备比生命本身更早出现在地球上。

822
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:41,679
我们不知道是什么神秘的恒星智慧创造了它们并将它们留在这里，

823
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:45,724
但我们在濒临灭绝的时候收到了这份礼物。

824
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:49,979
我们设法重新创造了这种伪坚韧的材料**

825
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:53,065
球体和引擎是由它组成的。

826
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:56,568
我们精确地复制了这两种设备。

827
00:02:57,486 --> 00:03:01,949
现在他们每个人都有一个同卵双胞胎。

828
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,869
用于星际飞行的曲速引擎

829
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:07,913
让我们找到了一颗行星

830
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:11,208
或多或少适合地形改造。

831
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:16,755
无人车完成向太阳系TESS的跳跃

832
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:21,176
并返回了证实我们理论的信息和样本。

833
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:27,307
而这个装置，这个球体，是用来创造生命的。

834
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,727
经过多年的研究，

835
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,272
我们发现了一种控制球体和引擎的方法。

836
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:37,109
这些设备有自己独特的语言。

837
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,404
我们解码了几十个命令，

838
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:43,532
每一个都对应一个特定的模式。

839
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,869
这种模式给出了最初的命令，

840
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:51,489
球体现在开始运行超过 40 亿年。

841
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,349
Sphere使用环境中的化学元素

842
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,769
创造一个真正的奇迹：

843
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:13,854
生活！

844
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,317
现在我们知道地球上的生命是由这台机器创造的。

845
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,446
球体是我们的起点。

846
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,785
让我向您介绍我们的领先研究科学家团队。

847
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,042
我们的团队包括： Peter Lehmann 博士，

848
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,128
外星曲速引擎专家。

849
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,756
莱昂娜·雷德伍德医生，

850
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:43,217
一个地球化程序构建器。

851
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,514
今天我们加入了受过军事训练的飞行员，

852
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,641
由瑞恩康纳少校领导。

853
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,105
我们要启程前往太阳系苔丝，

854
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:59,358
距离这里数百光年。

855
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:03,403
我们将把球体带到一个星球上

856
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,073
有合适的条件。

857
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,534
我们将创建

858
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:10,994
地球2.0，

859
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,831
人类的新家园。

860
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:35,824
你怎么看，彼得？

861
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,411
谁创造了这个，他们现在在哪里？

862
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:42,205
没有足够的数据可以说。

863
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:46,251
而且我真的不喜欢猜测这样的事情。

864
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:49,379
这与猜测无关。这是一个理论。

865
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:53,592
也许这是一个失落的文明。

866
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,220
我们从经验中知道高度发达的文明

867
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:59,931
善于自毁。

868
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,517
-谁知道？-是的。

869
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:32,130
嗯，人类又一次巨大的飞跃，嗯，伙计们？

870
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:37,677
只是这一次是字面意义上的，历史上第一次。

871
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:40,211
只要比一堆原子多的东西

872
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,157
到达目的地……

873
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:43,767
它仍然很重要。

874
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,104
说吧。历史上第一次。

875
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,736
注意力！并准备跳跃。

876
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,646
所有系统都准备好了。

877
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,482
坐标已设置。

878
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,860
曲速驱动设置为最大功率。

879
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:36,069
准备好？

880
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,574
从事。

881
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:22,324
关键错误。

882
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:25,494
关键错误。

883
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:29,122
关键错误。

884
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,334
关键错误。

885
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:51,955
我们在哪？

886
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,339
这是苔丝吗？

887
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:09,097
理查德，我们完成演习了吗？

888
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,057
是的我们做了。

889
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:14,561
星图……它们不匹配。

890
00:13:16,354 --> 00:13:17,480
这不是苔丝。

891
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,697
你放的是什么坐标？

892
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,117
你确定他们在运作吗？

893
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:31,786
当然，先生。

894
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:33,747
你检查引擎了吗？

895
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,833
一切都按照协议进行。

896
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,711
如果一切都按照协议完成，

897
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:41,588
我们现在就在苔丝。

898
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,382
任务失败了，彼得。

899
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,426
现在地球没有希望了。

900
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,805
- 允许检查引擎。-不。

901
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:52,724
你的职责被解除了。

902
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:55,560
待在你的铺位上，直到我另有说法。

903
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:04,653
是的先生。

904
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,884
这是什么？

905
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:14,597
在物理学中，有一个方程...

906
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:17,016
狄拉克方程。

907
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:21,062
当两个粒子接触时，

908
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,982
他们永远被束缚。

909
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,444
他们继续“感受”彼此，

910
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,864
即使它们相隔光年。

911
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:34,659
它被称为量子纠缠。

912
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,705
这对你来说是物理吗？

913
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,126
不仅仅是物理学。

914
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,872
尝试取消设置跳跃轨迹。

915
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,875
也许它会帮助我们弄清楚我们在哪里。

916
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:27,295
不，史蒂夫。轨迹不清楚。

917
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,632
这些数据根本没有任何意义。

918
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,009
我们进入了第四维度，

919
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:36,596
但这几乎就像我们沿着我们无法访问的坐标轴移动一样。

920
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:40,016
然后我们又跳回了三维空间。

921
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,812
但是哪里？

922
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:04,165
我们周围有什么东西可以帮助我们确定我们的位置吗？

923
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:08,586
不，没有地标。甚至没有任何熟悉的东西。

924
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:13,049
我们没有必要设置回跳。

925
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:15,468
所以这意味着

926
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,721
直到我们弄清楚我们在哪里，我们才能回来。

927
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,098
不。

928
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,977
修理气闸打开。

929
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,340
那是什么？

930
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,770
发动机舱维修气闸打开。

931
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,735
为什么？谁在那里？

932
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,950
修理气闸，这是船长的电话。气闸，报告。

933
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:41,619
不明物体接近。

934
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,417
不明物体接近。

935
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,381
不明物体接近。

936
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,387
不明物体接近。

937
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,934
不明物体接近。

938
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,743
拉屎！

939
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,684
我不敢相信。

940
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,685
冷静点，蕾欧娜。

941
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,314
如果我们想生存，就必须保持冷静。

942
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,359
我们已经是一个男人了。

943
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,948
彼得无视史蒂夫的命令，去了发动机舱，

944
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:04,827
意识到他做了什么，那就结束了。

945
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,623
彼得不会。

946
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,918
我认识他。

947
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,004
我和他一起工作了八年。

948
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:17,674
他不能这么轻易放弃。

949
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,258
蕾欧娜，够了。

950
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,261
你怎么能保护他？

951
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:26,391
现在我们必须处理他的错误造成的结果。

952
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,518
为他做他的工作。

953
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,064
一个人使多条生命处于危险之中。

954
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,652
他几乎摧毁了人类唯一的生存机会。

955
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:40,154
那是你应该为谁哭泣？

956
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:17,108
丽塔死后，我不想活了。

957
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,821
但后来我想，与其结束这一切

958
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,407
我可以让它有意义。

959
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:29,620
所以我决定全身心投入到这个使命中。

960
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,332
但现在事实证明

961
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:39,297
我在这里不如在地球上有用。

962
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:45,928
大卫…

963
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:51,017
一切都会好起来的。我们会找到解决办法的。

964
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,063
地球的未来取决于我们的使命。

965
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:57,273
放弃不是一种选择。

966
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:04,655
我们需要确定我们在宇宙的哪个部分。

967
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:07,158
-理查德，你有什么吗？-还没有。

968
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,204
我正在跟踪最近的恒星和行星的移动轨迹。

969
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,832
我会试着从那里计算我们的位置。

970
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,336
大卫，那个星球呢？

971
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,506
探头有数据吗？

972
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,801
刚加载。

973
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:29,472
伟大的。

974
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:33,017
这颗行星的表面是由火山岩构成的。

975
00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:36,104
没有生物圈。

976
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,690
有大气层，但没有氧气。

977
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,652
平均温度为16摄氏度。

978
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,115
外部环境不具侵略性。

979
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:49,826
我们需要的只是呼吸面罩。

980
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,540
这是完美的。

981
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,919
如果我可以在苔丝和这个星球之间做出选择，

982
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,213
我会去这里。

983
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,806
你知道我们有多幸运吗？

984
00:22:12,348 --> 00:22:16,269
在最适合 Sphere 的行星附近盘旋的可能性有多大？

985
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:18,312
如果这不是意外呢？

986
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,898
如果我们是故意被带到这里怎么办？

987
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,486
-通过谁？-同样的东西给我们留下了球体。

988
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,448
-瑞恩，准备下船。-你的意思是？

989
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:32,535
我们可以完成我们在这个星球上的使命。

990
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:34,871
但我们还没有检查它。

991
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,665
但这是我们的机会。

992
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,818
如果我们在这个星球上发射 Sphere

993
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:42,151
我们将有足够的时间来了解我们在哪里。

994
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:44,797
然后，其他船只来重复我们的工作。

995
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,969
理查德，准备着陆器去地球。

996
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,680
但它是一颗年轻的星球，大气不稳定。

997
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:54,182
我们对此一无所知。

998
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:56,767
进行地面着陆可能不安全。

999
00:22:56,934 --> 00:23:00,146
我同意，你不顾一切地冒着船员安全的风险。

1000
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,647
我反对它。

1001
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:05,193
值得庆幸的是，我是做出最终决定的人。

1002
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,446
不，史蒂夫。现在做出这样的决定还为时过早。

1003
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:11,365
我说我们正在着陆。

1004
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,452
理查德，在着陆区表演。

1005
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,412
你会降落在这里，在山谷里。

1006
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,332
下降的天气条件是最佳的。

1007
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,834
我们准备好了。启动取消对接程序。

1008
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,921
解除对接序列已启动。

1009
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,843
引擎已启动。

1010
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,429
高度为30,000米。下来。

1011
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:14,280
暴风雨前线正朝着你的方向前进。

1012
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:17,825
它是在几分钟前形成的。无法预料。

1013
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:20,244
风速高达每秒40米。

1014
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:24,206
所以坚持住。启动制动推进器。

1015
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:29,128
这是什么东西？

1016
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,464
- 这是怎么回事？- 是风。

1017
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:33,632
风暴相当凶猛。

1018
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,680
下降速度是着陆速度的两倍。我们正在坠落。

1019
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:41,682
我们要粉碎到地表。

1020
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:44,602
我可以加倍推力。它会减缓你的跌倒。

1021
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,689
如果我们使用它，我们将没有回程航班的燃料！

1022
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:52,693
如果我们不这样做，我们就会死！

1023
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,571
温度太极端了。你的洞正在融化。

1024
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:57,907
该死的！释放第一个坦克。

1025
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:12,546
我会尽量在空气动力学上减慢你的速度。

1026
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,465
我希望这个洞能撑得住。

1027
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:29,230
坚持，稍等。我们正在参与其中！

1028
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:30,398
为冲击做好准备！

1029
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,044
艾米…

1030
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:02,847
艾米，你为什么飞去？

1031
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:06,767
我需要你。

1032
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,528
我给你一些东西。

1033
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,447
这是什么？

1034
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,575
我们在一起一年了。

1035
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,288
你知道，球体对我来说意义重大，

1036
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:29,331
但不如你做的那么多。

1037
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:34,253
很显然，我知道你们两个相处不来。

1038
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:37,631
所以我想创造一些东西来连接你们俩。

1039
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:39,842
它是由旧的 Sphere 制成的。

1040
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,262
有一个片段真的很突出。

1041
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,599
这个很漂亮。谢谢你。

1042
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,518
我认为这将是象征性的。

1043
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:53,647
球体是我们的救赎，

1044
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,524
你是我的。

1045
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:04,825
我们回家吧。洒水车即将开始喷洒。

1046
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,620
让我们呆一会儿。

1047
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:02,841
- 着陆器的状态如何？- 无严重伤害。

1048
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,387
但它几乎没有燃料了。

1049
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,893
现在我们不能回到船上了，我们被困在这里了。

1050
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:17,398
为什么要回到船上？我们的计划是四年后回来。

1051
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:20,609
现在我们的主要任务是安装和启动 Sphere。

1052
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,361
我们正在继续该计划。

1053
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,154
但是我们现在不能执行。

1054
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:28,242
我们离着陆点太远了，进了山里。

1055
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,079
这意味着这里应该有洞穴。

1056
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:36,333
但是在这种地形上部署圆顶是不可能的。

1057
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:40,629
我们将在没有圆顶的情况下进行管理。一个足够深的洞穴

1058
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:43,382
将为 Sphere 提供适量的保护。

1059
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:46,010
那里！这个洞穴看起来很合适。

1060
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,846
它足够大且易于访问。

1061
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,098
Leona，你得到了关于地震活动的数据，

1062
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:52,725
大卫，调整程序。

1063
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,935
其他人，检查设备。

1064
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:58,564
开始工作吧，各位，还在等什么？

1065
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:46,088
这个星球上的条件比我们预期的还要好。

1066
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:49,383
其他船只将很快到达这里。

1067
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:53,345
人类新的历史从这里开始，

1068
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,097
在这一刻。

1069
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:55,259
我们做到了！我不敢相信。

1070
00:33:56,552 --> 00:34:00,180
彼得会很高兴的。为此，他非常努力。

1071
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:01,890
船长，你需要看看这个。

1072
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,141
他应该在这里。

1073
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,561
好的，注意，团队。

1074
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:07,521
我们正在返回基地。

1075
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:10,858
搬出去。

1076
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,907
大卫，你有数据吗？

1077
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:23,495
还没有。

1078
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,669
罗斯博士，这个车站正在执行戒严令。

1079
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,256
什么？为什么？

1080
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,258
我们有新的信息。

1081
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:37,467
理查德?

1082
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,720
开始播放。

1083
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,193
这是彼得·莱曼博士。

1084
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,740
针对所有命令，我将亲自进行发动机检查。

1085
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,101
我现在正在记录我的所有动作

1086
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:04,547
所以我没有被指控篡改结果。

1087
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:08,707
安全摄像头已关闭，因此我不会被打扰。

1088
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,043
我不会成为替罪羊。

1089
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,755
我要证明我没有错。

1090
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:03,136
帮助！

1091
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,358
那是什么？

1092
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:20,696
某种生命形式？

1093
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:23,198
这就是杀死彼得的原因吗？

1094
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,999
我从摄像机中观看了所有的录音。

1095
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,199
它第一次出现在球体上

1096
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:30,096
在我们离开地球之后。

1097
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:32,708
这东西是从球体里爬出来的？

1098
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:36,378
直接从特洛伊木马的故事中解脱出来。

1099
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:41,341
那个特洛伊木马就在跳跃之前爬进了引擎。

1100
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:45,137
那么也许它导致了失败？

1101
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:50,809
理查德，如果那个特洛伊木马还在船上，那你就有危险了。

1102
00:36:51,226 --> 00:36:53,937
不，他和你一起下去，

1103
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,605
进入球体。

1104
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:57,733
我们可以追踪它的位置。

1105
00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:00,986
它会在电磁场中造成干扰。

1106
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,264
这是着陆前摄像机的视频。

1107
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,618
我从洞穴中得到了第一批数据。

1108
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:10,746
有什么奇怪的。史蒂夫?

1109
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:21,798
球体内的二氧化碳和氧化水平正在上升，

1110
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:25,010
但没有任何生物标记。

1111
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:27,429
什么？会不会是故障？

1112
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:29,848
不，它正在满负荷工作。

1113
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:33,268
只是在与我们上传的程序不同的程序上。

1114
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,979
它在做别的事情。

1115
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:38,106
重组。

1116
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:41,359
我们要回到球体。我们需要调整设置。

1117
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,903
史蒂夫，没人会去任何地方。

1118
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:48,283
处理完威胁后，我们稍后会调整设置。

1119
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,953
但史蒂夫是该项目的负责人，他做主。

1120
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,663
不再。

1121
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:57,709
现在是船员生存的问题。

1122
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:00,504
史蒂夫，我接受指挥，你松了一口气。

1123
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,840
你不能那样做。

1124
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,760
人类的未来取决于这一使命。

1125
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:08,970
只有罗斯博士能做到。

1126
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:12,390
你确定罗斯博士给了我们所有的信息吗

1127
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,018
关于球体实际上是什么？

1128
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:17,729
你在说什么？

1129
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,482
理查德，展示洞穴里的视频。

1130
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:33,286
史蒂夫看到了异常。

1131
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,748
并且没有对任何人说什么

1132
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,417
冒着全体船员的生命危险。

1133
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:45,173
-它从哪里来的？- 就在球体上。

1134
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,428
事实证明，我们对此知之甚少。

1135
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,807
如果它是那些怪物的孵化器呢？

1136
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,521
我没有向你隐瞒任何关于 Sphere 的确认事实。

1137
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:04,317
讨论异常没有任何意义。

1138
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:07,529
如果我们知道这些异常情况，

1139
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,657
我们会以不同的方式对待球体，

1140
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,827
彼得现在还活着。

1141
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:46,443
大卫，很抱歉我没能成功。

1142
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:49,905
没关系。

1143
00:39:50,864 --> 00:39:52,782
我明白你有多忙。

1144
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,203
是的，我们没有太多的空闲时间。

1145
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,621
你为什么在这？

1146
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,126
医生说我没事。给了我一份干净的健康单。

1147
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,254
所以我准备好和大家一起进行预发布。

1148
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,173
什么？

1149
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,550
我是说你…

1150
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:14,262
你真的打算飞？

1151
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:17,974
但你是让我成为船员的人。

1152
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:19,643
但那是……

1153
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,561
前…

1154
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,356
丽塔死前？

1155
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,609
所以呢？我告诉你心理学家

1156
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:29,611
已确认我没事。

1157
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,447
但是失去一个女儿……

1158
00:40:33,073 --> 00:40:35,283
大卫，我非常抱歉。

1159
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:38,828
我知道你想回去工作

1160
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,206
但这不是最好的方法。

1161
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:44,709
现在你需要时间来悲伤。

1162
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,796
史蒂夫，我不是为了忘记我的女儿而飞。

1163
00:40:47,963 --> 00:40:50,173
她将永远是我的一部分。

1164
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,761
我和你一样了解 Sphere。

1165
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:56,304
你会需要我在那里。

1166
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:58,223
大卫，听着，

1167
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,351
我正在做的就是照顾你。

1168
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:02,811
什么？

1169
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,855
你是在抹黑我的名字吗？

1170
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:10,860
在我们做完这一切之后，你要把我留在场边吗？

1171
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:16,700
我可以帮你改变未来。

1172
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:19,953
不要把它从我身边拿走。

1173
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:40,140
-什么？-我们不能就这样离开它。

1174
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:43,727
我们必须回到洞穴并恢复设置。

1175
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:47,272
- 但是瑞恩下达了命令。-就咱俩。

1176
00:41:48,481 --> 00:41:50,150
我们悄悄出去。

1177
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:55,613
杀死彼得的东西还在里面。

1178
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,159
木马现在距离洞穴30公里，

1179
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:01,411
这意味着如果它决定回来

1180
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:03,940
我们至少还有半个小时才能出去。

1181
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:05,915
-瑞恩呢？-瑞恩太小心了。

1182
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,460
他在浪费时间。

1183
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,963
失去的日子就是失去的生命。

1184
00:42:13,923 --> 00:42:17,802
当丽塔快要死的时候，你和她一起慢慢地死去。

1185
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:20,722
我看到了那是什么样的。

1186
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:26,644
现在想象整个星球都以完全相同的方式死亡。

1187
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:31,900
慢慢地，不可逆转地，来自同一种病毒。

1188
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,959
这到底是什么？

1189
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:51,753
这是怎么回事？

1190
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:55,799
球体做到了这一点。

1191
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:58,676
- 你认为这是一个故障？-不仅仅是故障

1192
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,930
球体正在创造一种外星生命形式。

1193
00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:04,099
而且非常快。

1194
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:06,684
比它在地球上创造生命的速度还要快。

1195
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,647
我们不应该碰它。我们需要和大家讨论这个问题。

1196
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:12,690
我们需要制定一个行动计划。

1197
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,568
有人重新调整了 Sphere 的设置。

1198
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:23,618
木马越来越近了，我们得离开了。

1199
00:43:23,785 --> 00:43:24,744
等一下。

1200
00:43:25,078 --> 00:43:25,912
你听不见我吗？

1201
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,498
拿我们的生命冒险是没有意义的！我们走吧！

1202
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:30,083
离我远点，该死的！

1203
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:42,220
-你疯了吗？-结束了！任务结束！

1204
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,513
处理它！

1205
00:43:45,348 --> 00:43:47,767
球体是敌对的！

1206
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:52,272
放下枪，大卫！放下它！

1207
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:55,150
你想因为这个狗屎而死吗？

1208
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,113
太晚了，已经到了。

1209
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:39,629
气闸关闭。加压完成。

1210
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:49,973
你是个精神病患者，史蒂夫。因为你，我们都差点死掉。

1211
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:58,982
这与我们无关。我们必须完成任务。

1212
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,736
如果你损坏了 Sphere，这一切都将是徒劳的。

1213
00:46:04,153 --> 00:46:07,240
那你应该开枪打死我。你为什么不呢？

1214
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:13,788
如果你再次威胁任务

1215
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:15,873
我将会。

1216
00:46:23,506 --> 00:46:27,510
史蒂夫，你到底在做什么？当时你在哪里？

1217
00:46:28,094 --> 00:46:30,430
你为什么违背我的命令离开着陆器？

1218
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:33,391
我们做了我们必须做的。

1219
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,151
您不再有权做出决定。

1220
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:47,989
我会做出我认为必要的决定。

1221
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:49,365
要不然是啥？

1222
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:52,076
你要去做什么？动武？

1223
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:54,829
然后继续！好吧？

1224
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:56,080
快点！

1225
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:06,007
模块完整性受损。

1226
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:09,218
你做了什么？

1227
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:11,220
模块完整性受损。

1228
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,934
模块完整性受损。

1229
00:48:46,315 --> 00:48:47,316
安静，亲爱的。

1230
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,028
我们离得太近了，我快要失去理智了。

1231
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,655
那是什么？

1232
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,825
木马在着陆器中。

1233
00:48:56,743 --> 00:49:00,288
下层甲板有个洞，一切都被这狗屎盖住了。

1234
00:49:00,455 --> 00:49:02,248
那么，我们现在该怎么办？

1235
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:08,045
静静地，慢慢地。我们走吧。

1236
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:23,060
呼吸困难。

1237
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:52,548
回来。

1238
00:49:52,715 --> 00:49:54,550
什么？为什么？

1239
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:57,887
它在这里。

1240
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:19,492
跑步！

1241
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:42,932
发生了什么？你还好吗？

1242
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,017
木马…

1243
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:46,936
特洛伊木马在实验室。

1244
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:50,189
你意识到你做了什么吗？

1245
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:51,774
你把它带到这里来了！

1246
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:15,089
- 能进去吗？-我们不知道。

1247
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:18,551
它损坏了发电机，相机无法正常工作。

1248
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:20,887
我们已经失去了与飞船的联系，所以……

1249
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:23,389
我们没有来自太空的视频。

1250
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:27,560
这是系统上保存的最后一个视频。

1251
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:29,979
它正在寻找船体中的弱点。

1252
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:35,276
它通过冷却系统进入。

1253
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,486
钢最薄的地方。

1254
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:40,907
所以这东西很聪明？它可以思考吗？

1255
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,159
不管能不能想，

1256
00:51:43,492 --> 00:51:47,788
如果我们把它抽出来，把洞关上，它就不能爬回来了。

1257
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:49,790
但是怎么做？我们怎样才能把它抽出来？

1258
00:51:49,957 --> 00:51:51,834
我们甚至看不到它在哪里。

1259
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:56,339
我们必须恢复安全摄像头和通信。

1260
00:51:56,923 --> 00:52:01,594
木马损坏了主发电机，但生命支持系统正在工作。

1261
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:04,347
这意味着备用发电机很好。

1262
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:07,975
我们可以将网络和摄像头连接到它。

1263
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,768
我们将不得不一直对保险丝盒视而不见

1264
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:13,630
不知道那个混蛋在哪里。这太冒险了。

1265
00:52:16,442 --> 00:52:17,860
都是我的错。

1266
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:20,196
所以我会去的。

1267
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,367
我会看你的六。

1268
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:38,751
史蒂夫，

1269
00:54:38,918 --> 00:54:40,419
你需要离开那里，现在！

1270
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:38,435
你受伤了吗？

1271
00:55:43,816 --> 00:55:45,651
信号和摄像头怎么样？

1272
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:48,737
都在那里。重新上线。

1273
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:52,992
该死的！它正在传输比球体更强的 EMP 场。

1274
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:55,452
旁边的电子设备都快疯了。

1275
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,121
所以现在怎么办？

1276
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,671
你有没有见过一头狂暴的公牛在人群后面奔跑

1277
00:56:03,771 --> 00:56:05,973
在斗牛之前沿着狭窄的通道走下去？

1278
00:56:07,882 --> 00:56:09,508
公牛想追赶跑者，

1279
00:56:10,342 --> 00:56:13,012
但他最终和斗牛士一起进入了竞技场。

1280
00:56:13,762 --> 00:56:17,224
木马就是公牛。它也想抓住我们。

1281
00:56:18,726 --> 00:56:22,521
我们有机会把它带到任何我们想要的地方，比如在着陆器外面。

1282
00:56:23,522 --> 00:56:25,149
对每个人来说都是一个巨大的风险，

1283
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,568
但这一切都是值得的。

1284
00:56:38,037 --> 00:56:39,205
着陆器有两个气闸：

1285
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,625
中心的一个，实验室的一个。

1286
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,754
我会在敞开的中央舱门前。

1287
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:49,131
我将成为主要诱饵。

1288
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:54,303
木马会沿着走廊追我。

1289
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:59,808
一旦我们到外面，你就会关闭引擎到它后面的气闸。

1290
00:57:00,142 --> 00:57:01,397
明白了吗？

1291
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:05,773
但为了做到这一切，我们需要到达气闸。

1292
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,067
这就是特洛伊木马的所在。

1293
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:11,779
我们可以把它隔离在主走廊，这里。

1294
00:57:11,946 --> 00:57:14,073
内门撑不了多久，

1295
00:57:15,074 --> 00:57:16,909
但应该为我们争取一些时间。

1296
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:22,248
我会引诱他进入孵化空间。并将他锁在里面

1297
00:58:37,323 --> 00:58:41,410
木马被拦截后，我们每个人都会向特定位置报告。

1298
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:45,372
大卫，你和我将打开实验室的空气舱。

1299
00:58:46,582 --> 00:58:47,838
你会在那里等我，

1300
00:58:48,187 --> 00:58:52,129
而我会去外面做木马的诱饵。

1301
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:55,090
但是为了让木马看到我然后出来

1302
00:58:55,758 --> 00:58:59,470
气闸的两侧都必须打开，

1303
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,680
外面和里面。

1304
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:05,684
这就是为什么 Leona 会手动打开气闸

1305
00:59:06,602 --> 00:59:09,188
躲在这里，在技术区。

1306
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:46,683
当木马追上我时，它会跑过来，

1307
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:49,561
经过发动机的转向喷嘴。

1308
00:59:49,728 --> 00:59:51,480
应该还有一些燃料。

1309
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,025
如果我们在正确的时刻转动引擎

1310
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:58,737
我们不会只是把它抽出来，我们会烤它。

1311
00:59:59,613 --> 01:00:01,532
滚开，你这该死的混蛋！

1312
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:04,201
匆忙！撑不了多久了！

1313
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:06,954
不要惊慌。释放木马。

1314
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:09,123
躲在科技湾。

1315
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:10,707
你能行的。

1316
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:36,150
我正在打开引擎。

1317
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:38,485
它不工作。木马正在破坏系统。

1318
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:40,112
史蒂夫，快跑！

1319
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:51,790
引擎开启。

1320
01:00:51,957 --> 01:00:54,001
蕾欧娜，出去！出去！

1321
01:01:11,518 --> 01:01:13,729
瑞恩，气闸！关闭气闸！

1322
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:22,029
拉屎！

1323
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:43,842
安息吧，弗兰克。

1324
01:02:10,577 --> 01:02:14,581
它的一部分触手被门切断。它回到了山洞。

1325
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,714
加压完成。

1326
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:25,634
氧气水平恢复正常。

1327
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:32,516
它不会回到这里。

1328
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:34,935
但球体在它的控制之下。

1329
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:37,688
不是很长。

1330
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:47,030
艾米。

1331
01:02:48,407 --> 01:02:49,575
它是什么？

1332
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,245
是病毒……

1333
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:57,958
从字面上看，它已经在我们家了。

1334
01:03:01,336 --> 01:03:02,754
你不应该去执行这个任务。

1335
01:03:03,255 --> 01:03:06,133
艾米，你在说什么？我们讨论了一切。

1336
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:10,637
你已经做得够多了。这不是你的任务。

1337
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:14,308
-打扰一下？- 你甚至不是宇航员。

1338
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:20,814
你需要我

1339
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:24,151
在发射前一周走出去？

1340
01:03:24,526 --> 01:03:26,069
你怎么了？

1341
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:33,410
我们要生孩子了。

1342
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,125
什么？

1343
01:03:42,044 --> 01:03:43,253
留下来。

1344
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,049
我们将研究疫苗。我找到了一条有希望的途径。

1345
01:03:47,633 --> 01:03:51,219
该任务将创造一个新地球，但我们可以拯救这个地球。

1346
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:54,659
这是我的疫苗蓝图，请看一下。

1347
01:03:55,162 --> 01:03:56,467
我真的很高兴。

1348
01:03:57,768 --> 01:03:59,478
但这时机太差了。

1349
01:04:01,521 --> 01:04:03,565
我不会看到他长大。

1350
01:04:04,566 --> 01:04:08,487
史蒂夫，我求你了。请留下来陪我。和我们在一起。

1351
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,948
我不能，我必须在那里。我必须。

1352
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,909
你已经做了你能做的一切。

1353
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:16,995
我们现在可以研制疫苗。我想我在做某事。

1354
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,165
我需要拯救地球。

1355
01:04:40,185 --> 01:04:41,844
我们必须研究这种生物，

1356
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:44,624
这样我们就可以了解您感染了什么。

1357
01:04:57,035 --> 01:04:59,830
我猜，这是一个生物机器人。

1358
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:18,724
这些是制造 Sphere 的相同材料。

1359
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:32,362
当它们与水接触时，它们也会改变它们的特性。

1360
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:36,658
我们研究过它从来不理解

1361
01:05:36,825 --> 01:05:41,329
它的功能之一是创建木马。

1362
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,708
也许他们比我们先进得多。

1363
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,919
而且更好。

1364
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:06,021
大卫，听着……

1365
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:11,860
告诉我你发现了什么。

1366
01:06:15,489 --> 01:06:17,783
感染你的细菌

1367
01:06:19,618 --> 01:06:23,038
拥有异常强大的防御机制。

1368
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,216
我研究了它们。

1369
01:06:34,341 --> 01:06:36,259
弄清楚它们是如何工作的。

1370
01:06:37,302 --> 01:06:40,430
这就是我们多年来一直在寻找的东西。

1371
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:47,277
你的血液是疫苗的关键

1372
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:49,815
那一直在摧毁地球上的生命。

1373
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,943
它不会改变任何东西。

1374
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:54,903
你不明白吗？

1375
01:06:55,654 --> 01:06:57,405
我们可以拯救世界。

1376
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,160
而且这一切都是因为你。你是真正的英雄。

1377
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:09,501
我会给你一些止痛药，你会感觉好多了。

1378
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,136
这里什么都没有……

1379
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,627
那是什么？

1380
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,173
大卫…

1381
01:08:40,008 --> 01:08:41,801
这是一个转发器。

1382
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:46,348
我们可以看到 Sphere 的连接。

1383
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,978
这是他们殖民行星的方式。

1384
01:08:52,771 --> 01:08:54,189
怎么样了？

1385
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,651
这是一个生物机器人。

1386
01:08:58,026 --> 01:09:00,236
我们必须想办法摧毁它

1387
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:02,530
并恢复 Sphere 中的设置。

1388
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:07,202
不，史蒂夫。已经有太多人因为你而死了。

1389
01:09:09,663 --> 01:09:11,873
等待。你做了什么？

1390
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:15,752
你把我锁在里面了吗？

1391
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,629
你被捕了，史蒂夫。

1392
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:20,298
瑞安，

1393
01:09:21,174 --> 01:09:22,717
我们必须共同努力。

1394
01:09:23,843 --> 01:09:25,553
给彼得、弗兰克和莱昂娜。

1395
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,098
否则他们都白白死去——

1396
01:09:28,682 --> 01:09:30,684
人对你来说是消耗品。

1397
01:09:31,726 --> 01:09:34,354
瑞恩！瑞恩！

1398
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:37,983
他是对的。

1399
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:50,328
史蒂夫，对你来说最重要的从来不是人类的拯救。

1400
01:09:51,496 --> 01:09:53,415
你总是想扮演英雄。

1401
01:09:55,667 --> 01:10:00,130
而现在你只想赢，不关心别人的生活。

1402
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,705
艾米，跟我说话。

1403
01:10:41,087 --> 01:10:44,466
我读了你的提议。它看起来真的很有希望。

1404
01:10:46,134 --> 01:10:47,594
真正的突破。

1405
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:51,431
创造疫苗的机会。最后，一个真实的。

1406
01:10:57,312 --> 01:11:00,482
但我确实需要去。为了我们。

1407
01:11:04,486 --> 01:11:06,404
我不知道没有你我会做什么

1408
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,824
但我保证我会回来的。

1409
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:14,037
我需要你。

1410
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,332
你们俩。

1411
01:11:24,464 --> 01:11:25,548
告诉他…

1412
01:11:27,258 --> 01:11:28,510
还是她…

1413
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:34,307
像上帝一样的爸爸正在创造新的地球。

1414
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:41,106
你一直说你这样做是为了拯救所有人。

1415
01:11:41,773 --> 01:11:43,441
但是每个人都是谁？

1416
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:46,069
你看不到你周围的人。

1417
01:11:46,945 --> 01:11:51,324
你只关心你和你的项目。为什么还要打扰？

1418
01:11:52,033 --> 01:11:54,702
成为被誉为救世主的人？是这样吗？

1419
01:12:01,543 --> 01:12:03,086
为了拯救我们的未来。

1420
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:10,051
我想知道你真正想要保存的是什么。

1421
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:42,542
理查德，你模拟了最近恒星的轨迹？

1422
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:45,962
那没有给我们任何东西。你认为你会在那里找到什么？

1423
01:12:46,713 --> 01:12:48,521
你说当我们跳的时候

1424
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:52,051
我们沿着我们无法接近的坐标轴移动。

1425
01:12:52,927 --> 01:12:55,263
如果那个轴不是空间的呢？

1426
01:12:58,683 --> 01:13:00,768
向我们展示这些星星的外观

1427
01:13:00,935 --> 01:13:04,564
宇宙膨胀超过四十亿年。

1428
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:09,027
是的，重新计算。

1429
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,376
我们没有在太空中移动。

1430
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,546
我们及时搬家。

1431
01:13:29,714 --> 01:13:31,466
是大熊座。

1432
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,177
和猎户座。

1433
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,222
还有北极星……

1434
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:39,724
和我们的……

1435
01:13:42,602 --> 01:13:43,728
太阳？

1436
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:56,115
大地寂静而空虚，

1437
01:13:57,408 --> 01:14:00,620
和深渊上的黑暗。

1438
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:06,584
这意味着我们在地球上？

1439
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:10,255
在生命本身开始之前？

1440
01:14:20,473 --> 01:14:22,684
大约四十亿年前。

1441
01:14:25,103 --> 01:14:26,771
你是怎么想出来的？

1442
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,948
这是飞离球体的碎片

1443
01:14:37,156 --> 01:14:38,658
当大卫向它开枪时。

1444
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:42,287
这是破碎的片段。

1445
01:14:43,705 --> 01:14:47,083
这是我为艾米制作的手镯上的同一件。

1446
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:55,466
因为它是完全相同的片段。

1447
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,014
这里的球体和地球上的旧球体

1448
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,559
是完全相同的球体，

1449
01:15:06,352 --> 01:15:07,937
但在不同的时期。

1450
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:12,442
一些文明在地球上发送了球体

1451
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:15,611
创造一个适合他们的生物圈。

1452
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:18,114
但是出了点问题。

1453
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:21,117
但这意味着无论我们在这里做什么，

1454
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:25,121
我们不会拯救地球上的人吗？

1455
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:27,707
只剩下一个选项，

1456
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:31,294
告诉艾米那些外星细菌

1457
01:15:32,337 --> 01:15:34,422
并帮助她研制疫苗。

1458
01:15:35,882 --> 01:15:37,300
你打算怎么做？

1459
01:15:38,843 --> 01:15:43,681
我们知道球体将一直留在洞穴中，直到我们的时间。

1460
01:15:47,769 --> 01:15:51,606
我会把这个碎片做成一个手镯送给艾米。

1461
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:57,820
我会写信告诉她如何连接球体。

1462
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,583
但艾米在我们离开之前拿到了手镯。

1463
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,418
而她什么也没说。

1464
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,464
我相信艾米会想念我的。

1465
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,852
她会来拿手镯，

1466
01:16:20,269 --> 01:16:23,137
她迟早会看到这些铭文。

1467
01:16:23,971 --> 01:16:26,724
剩下的就是把零件放回去

1468
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,476
并重新配置系统。

1469
01:16:30,561 --> 01:16:32,063
还是我们所知道的生活

1470
01:16:33,147 --> 01:16:34,732
永远不会出现。

1471
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:37,485
人类也不会。

1472
01:18:17,168 --> 01:18:18,836
史蒂夫！史蒂夫！

1473
01:18:19,504 --> 01:18:21,506
Ryan 正计划炸毁 Sphere。

1474
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:23,966
把我和他联系起来。

1475
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:27,970
他关掉了收音机。

1476
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:29,347
你需要找到他

1477
01:18:29,514 --> 01:18:30,806
并解释一切。

1478
01:18:31,933 --> 01:18:34,018
去吧，我已经重新打开了气闸。

1479
01:19:04,215 --> 01:19:05,466
停在那儿。

1480
01:19:08,427 --> 01:19:09,303
瑞安…

1481
01:19:12,557 --> 01:19:14,850
球体是我们唯一的机会。

1482
01:19:15,935 --> 01:19:17,562
甚至不要尝试。

1483
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:21,691
好的。好的。

1484
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:24,402
但你的计划仍然行不通。

1485
01:19:27,572 --> 01:19:28,614
它会。

1486
01:19:29,824 --> 01:19:30,950
你会看到的。

1487
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,579
你想把炸弹带到山洞里，

1488
01:19:35,663 --> 01:19:40,251
在那里等待特洛伊木马并将其与球体一起炸毁。

1489
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:43,379
但是如果它在途中攻击你怎么办？

1490
01:19:46,465 --> 01:19:48,217
那我就上去

1491
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,970
和他一起冒烟。

1492
01:19:52,305 --> 01:19:53,806
你会输的。

1493
01:19:55,433 --> 01:20:00,479
毕竟Sphere会继续创造环境

1494
01:20:00,646 --> 01:20:02,315
木马需要的。

1495
01:20:03,774 --> 01:20:07,612
你有什么建议？你有更好的主意吗？

1496
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,114
让我们引诱木马，

1497
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:12,283
进入着陆器，

1498
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:16,704
锁定气闸并将其炸毁。

1499
01:20:17,204 --> 01:20:18,289
这里。

1500
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:25,129
大卫，为什么？

1501
01:20:26,756 --> 01:20:27,965
对于丽塔。

1502
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,679
-她死了。——她还没有死。

1503
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:37,725
-你疯了。-我不是。

1504
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:44,357
在山洞里发生的事情之后，我明白了。

1505
01:20:52,323 --> 01:20:53,892
特洛伊木马没有杀死我，

1506
01:20:55,021 --> 01:21:00,359
它不会无缘无故地做任何事情。

1507
01:21:05,211 --> 01:21:06,712
它选择了我。

1508
01:21:08,673 --> 01:21:10,174
我会帮助它。

1509
01:21:11,676 --> 01:21:13,719
我们不应该在这里。

1510
01:21:14,053 --> 01:21:15,471
我们是个错误。

1511
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:20,142
你是帮助我理解这一点的人。

1512
01:21:28,776 --> 01:21:31,987
我意识到我们都和你一样，史蒂夫。

1513
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:34,323
我们不是被创造出来的。

1514
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,660
我们是 Sphere 的故障。

1515
01:21:40,913 --> 01:21:42,623
但我会修复它。

1516
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:46,085
大卫，醒醒！

1517
01:21:46,252 --> 01:21:48,170
你不能那样帮助丽塔！

1518
01:21:50,464 --> 01:21:52,425
她不会生来就受苦，

1519
01:21:53,467 --> 01:21:55,720
她不会在八岁时死去。

1520
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:58,676
没有其他人会受苦，史蒂夫，

1521
01:21:58,776 --> 01:22:02,180
因为永远不会有任何人开始。

1522
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:15,072
人们应该有机会，大卫。

1523
01:22:16,157 --> 01:22:17,742
人不会变。

1524
01:26:53,058 --> 01:26:54,518
遇见使命。

1525
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:56,770
遇见使命。

1526
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:02,443
遇见使命。遇见使命。

1527
01:27:04,403 --> 01:27:05,738
进来，使命。

1528
01:27:07,573 --> 01:27:08,866
拜托了伙计们。

1529
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:11,493
遭遇使命……

1530
01:27:14,955 --> 01:27:15,998
遇见使命。

1531
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,085
遇见使命！

1532
01:27:23,464 --> 01:27:24,631
遇见使命！

1533
01:27:27,634 --> 01:27:28,761
遇见使命！

1534
01:27:31,805 --> 01:27:32,890
理查德。

1535
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:35,434
史蒂夫！感谢上帝！

1536
01:27:35,976 --> 01:27:37,853
我在摄像机上看到了爆炸。

1537
01:27:37,978 --> 01:27:40,189
-我以为你们都是……
-特洛伊木马被摧毁了。

1538
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:46,653
-瑞恩呢？- 他没有成功。

1539
01:27:55,162 --> 01:27:58,290
史蒂夫，你的氧气含量正在下降。

1540
01:27:58,957 --> 01:28:01,543
看起来像一些弹片刺穿了坦克。

1541
01:28:03,295 --> 01:28:06,006
-我有多少时间？-大约一小时。

1542
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:10,385
听着，我会降落船来接你。

1543
01:28:10,511 --> 01:28:14,223
不，这里有暴风雨。你会崩溃的。

1544
01:28:15,849 --> 01:28:17,309
你要做什么？

1545
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:21,396
我要去洞穴。我需要联系艾米。

1546
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,234
风暴平息后立即降落船。

1547
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:28,153
上帝保佑，史蒂夫。

1548
01:30:52,839 --> 01:30:54,341
请开始工作。

1549
01:31:11,692 --> 01:31:12,651
史蒂夫！

1550
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:20,742
艾米？

1551
01:31:30,043 --> 01:31:31,461
史蒂夫！

1552
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:34,256
你在哪里？

1553
01:31:35,215 --> 01:31:38,927
-我在遥远的过去的某个地方。-你的意思是？

1554
01:31:39,261 --> 01:31:43,849
我们没有太多时间。我知道如何拯救地球。

1555
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:46,268
你走在正确的道路上。

1556
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:50,439
有一种机制可以帮助我们制造疫苗。

1557
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:53,567
我亲眼看到了这里。

1558
01:31:54,526 --> 01:31:57,696
-你能写点什么吗？-当然。当然。

1559
01:32:01,992 --> 01:32:04,601
你必须教植物细胞

1560
01:32:04,701 --> 01:32:08,123
快速识别病毒的任何突变。

1561
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,792
这是抗原配方。

1562
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:13,587
艾米，我答应过会回来看你的。

1563
01:32:14,379 --> 01:32:15,839
我很抱歉。

1564
01:32:19,176 --> 01:32:22,888
-不。史蒂夫……-我只后悔一件事……

1565
01:32:26,892 --> 01:32:28,852
我再也不会抱你了

1566
01:32:31,438 --> 01:32:33,023
和我们的孩子。

1567
01:32:35,942 --> 01:32:37,611
我们有联系，记得吗？

1568
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:41,698
你会永远和我在一起。和我们。

1569
01:32:56,421 --> 01:32:58,924
我爱你。你们俩。

1570
01:33:11,603 --> 01:33:12,771
史蒂夫。

1571
01:33:15,148 --> 01:33:16,483
我爱你。

1572
01:33:18,026 --> 01:33:19,319
史蒂夫…

1573
01:34:25,969 --> 01:34:30,056
主啊，地球充满了上帝的怜悯。

1574
01:34:31,308 --> 01:34:33,435
教导我你的律例。

1575
01:34:34,186 --> 01:34:36,521
教我良好的判断力和知识。

1576
01:34:37,856 --> 01:34:40,484
在我受苦之前，我误入歧途。

1577
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:43,653
但现在我遵守了你的话。

1578
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:48,533
你的手创造了我，塑造了我。

1579
01:34:49,993 --> 01:34:53,288
让你的慈悲临到我，

1580
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:57,417
好让我活下去。
