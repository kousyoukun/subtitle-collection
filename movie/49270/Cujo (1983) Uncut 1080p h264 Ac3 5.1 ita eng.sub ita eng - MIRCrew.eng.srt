1
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,089
Mommy!

2
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,969
Bad dreams?

3
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,304
- Mommy.
- It's all over.

4
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,348
Come here.

5
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,934
It was in my closet.
Something's in my closet.

6
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,978
Oh, too much junk food.

7
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,689
Too much of the tube, guys.

8
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,482
He's in there.

9
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,736
Tad, now, there's nothing in this house
that's going to hurt you.

10
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,530
Look what I see in the closet here.
I see clothing.

11
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,782
I see a pile of blankets on a chair...

12
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,326
a lot oftoys
that weren't put away...

13
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,414
and your favorite
over-the-hill teddy bear...

14
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,833
who would probably be
a lot happier-

15
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,381
Who would probably be
a lot happier in bed with you.

16
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,216
And that's it.

17
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,219
- Nothing else.
- I saw him, really.

18
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,971
He's in the closet.

19
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:33,726
He has yellow eyes,
and his mouth is about this long...

20
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,438
and he has teeth,
and they're curled like this...

21
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,356
and he made sounds.

22
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:44,070
What kind of sounds?

23
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,948
Come on, try.
What kind of sounds? Like what?

24
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,956
- That would scare me pretty good.
- Really.

25
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,875
But he's all gone now,
champ, see?

26
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,338
He's in there. I saw him. Really.

27
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,964
Tad, you saw him in
your dreams—

28
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,591
in your head, nowhere else.

29
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,134
See, Tad,
there aren't any real—

30
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,805
Tad, listen to me,
there's no such thing as real monsters...

31
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,348
only in stories.

32
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,600
There's no real monsters.

33
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,145
- Really?
- Really.

34
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,730
Really.

35
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,943
Okay, over, done with,
gone, right?

36
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,528
Over, done with, gone.

37
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,905
What a guy.
Okay, snuggle in.

38
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,743
Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite.

39
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,291
- You have good dreams now, okay?
- I will.

40
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,550
There aren't any monsters, Tad.

41
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,189
Except for the one in my closet.

42
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,068
Please.

43
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,197
Please. Please.

44
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,683
Hey, Tadder.

45
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,561
You know, it looks like someone
was moving furniture around...

46
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,396
up in your bedroom last night.

47
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,481
Any idea who that might have been?

48
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,321
- Do you know, Donna?
- It wasn't me.

49
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,907
It wasn't me, either.

50
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,491
Wasn't me.

51
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,204
Yeah, come on in, Steve.

52
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,831
Morning!

53
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,542
- Mrs. Trenton.
- Morning.

54
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,295
Here you go, Tadpole.

55
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,089
Just like I promised—
Brought your horse back.

56
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,674
Looks pretty good stripped,
doesn't it?

57
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,594
- Do we have a check for him?
- Listen.

58
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,055
Why don't you just wait
until I bring your table back?

59
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,641
Thanks.

60
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,227
I can't stay for a cup
of coffee anyway.

61
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,438
Sorry. Would you like a cup?

62
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,023
Just teasing.

63
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,943
Hey Tad, maybe it was Mr. Kemp
who moved all your furniture around, huh?

64
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:34,531
Okay, what did I do now, huh?

65
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,450
No, the monster did it.

66
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,118
The monster?

67
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,204
Oh, no. Come on,
remember what I said.

68
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,290
There aren't
no such things as monsters.

69
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,126
There aren't any
such things as monsters.

70
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,045
Not in the daytime anyway.

71
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,633
Come here, you!
Not in the daytime?

72
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,677
I'll show you what a monster
would do in the daytime.

73
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,304
He's grab your knee
is what he'd—

74
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,807
- I know a lot about cereal.
- Daddy! Daddy! Look!

75
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,060
Because I'm
the Sharp Cereal Professor.

76
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:08,148
Sharp cereals: Twinkles,
Cocoa Bears, Brand 1 6.

77
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,900
My daddy invented that.

78
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,319
He made them all up.

79
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,989
- Who?
- The professor.

80
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,574
And they're good for you.

81
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,828
Well, your daddy's
real smart, isn't he?

82
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,247
As well as being a hell
of a tennis player.

83
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,207
Ready for a rematch
any time you are.

84
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,543
- Sure, sure.
- Gotta go.

85
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
Bye.

86
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,713
Thanks.

87
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,011
Nothing wrong here.

88
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,560
That's game, set, and match.

89
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,520
- Good game.
- Oh, yeah, what was the score?

90
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,897
- 6-love, 6-1 ?
- Yeah.

91
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,236
You're not getting tired
ofthis, are you?

92
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,780
What, are you kidding me?
Getting my ass handed to me every week.

93
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,782
No, I love it, I'm a masochist.

94
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,118
- Well, whatever turns you on.
- Yeah.

95
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,652
...the onlyjeans that-

96
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,946
Turn that off, please.
It's dinner.

97
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,864
Turn it off, Tad.

98
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
This marriage is definitely
running out of conversation, isn't it?

99
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,885
Maybe we should talk
about having another baby.

100
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,395
I got you!

101
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,691
Oh, no, he's got me.

102
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
He's got me!

103
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,735
Watch my chair!

104
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,842
Hi.

105
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,385
Excuse me.

106
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,722
I have a problem with my front wheel.
I wonder ifyou could look at it.

107
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,725
Park it next to the Datsun.
Leave the keys in it.

108
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,521
Well, I was kind of hoping
I could wait for it today.

109
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,817
You're kidding.

110
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,153
See you later, Harry.

111
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,914
Joe Camber will do it for you.

112
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,375
What's that?

113
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,960
Joe Camber.

114
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,713
Do a real good job,
and he won't rob you blind.

115
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,677
Where's Joe Camber?

116
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,971
You take 1 1 7 here
straight out of town...

117
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,057
6 mile, give or take.

118
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,726
All the way out to the end.
You'll see Camber's mailbox.

119
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,311
You can't miss it.

120
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,981
Thanks.

121
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,319
See you later, Harry.

122
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,863
Hi.

123
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,742
Pa!

124
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,673
Tough time finding this place.
How are you?

125
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,968
My name is Victor Trenton.
You're Mr. Camber, right?

126
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,859
Afternoon.

127
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,032
You folks want anything to drink?

128
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,327
No, thank you. Thanks.

129
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,641
Vic?

130
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
Come on, Cujo.

131
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,354
Come on, boy. Come on.

132
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,357
Get going. That dog.
Look at that dog.

133
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,108
Don't worry about it, ma'am.

134
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,527
Cujo won't hurt him.
He likes kids.

135
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,157
- He's safe.
- Run me down the hill.

136
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,618
- I want to have a listen to her.
- Yeah, okay.

137
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,287
- Vic?
- It's all right.

138
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,206
Yeah, it's all right.

139
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,251
Don't worry, Mr. Trenton.
Your boy will be all right.

140
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,101
Gently.

141
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,895
Cujo. His name's Cujo.

142
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,772
Cujo?

143
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,899
How you doing, Cujo?

144
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,609
Hey, boy.

145
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,277
What kind of dog is he?

146
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,904
St. Bernard.

147
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,489
He's a great dog.

148
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,200
Yeah, he's a pretty smart one, too.

149
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,207
Monsters, stay out ofTad's room.

150
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,959
You have no business here.

151
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,754
No monsters in Tad's closet.

152
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,506
It's too small for you in there.

153
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,635
Where else?

154
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,220
Under the bed.

155
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,013
Under the bed? Okay.

156
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,226
All right, no monsters under Tad's bed.

157
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,855
You cannot fit under there.

158
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,816
No monsters outside Tad's window.

159
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,402
Can't hold on out there.

160
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,738
Nothing will touch Tad.

161
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,740
Nothing will hurt Tad...

162
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,200
all through this night.

163
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,785
Okay?

164
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,664
They have no business here.

165
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,379
Okay?

166
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,101
Oh, my God, 1 :30?

167
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,113
What?

168
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,699
You're just really good
with him, that's all.

169
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,745
How am I with you?

170
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,330
Wonderful.

171
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,667
Good night.

172
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,018
Nothing wrong here.

173
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,521
Well, that's not entirely true.

174
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,023
This morning, thousands of
people across the country...

175
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,068
reported internal hemorrhaging
after eating Sharp Cereal products.

176
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,695
The scare, however,
proved to be a false alarm.

177
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,239
- Hi!
- Hi.

178
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,949
- Hi, Tad.
- Hi, Dad.

179
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,410
Despite that fact, the scare
has reached alarming proportions.

180
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,831
Sharp Cereal has been
unavailable for comment.

181
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,667
Nope, nothing wrong here, folks.

182
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,252
Cute.

183
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,047
That's our ad campaign.

184
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,007
They've recalled
the whole goddamn cereal.

185
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,968
- There's no harm done, is there?
- No harm done?

186
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,262
Donna, that guy comes into
America's living room...

187
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,264
and he says to kids, "Trust me!"

188
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,266
- Yes, I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

189
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,017
We created that guy-
Roger and me.

190
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,270
- He's our brainchild.
- I understand.

191
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,480
These kids, they go out,
and they buy the cereal.

192
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,732
All the Sharp cereals.
All of them.

193
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,862
Brand 1 6, All-Grain,
Cocoa Bears, Twinkles.

194
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,239
And now, kids
all over the country...

195
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,449




are peeing
and puking red dye...

196
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,035
and scaring the hell
out oftheir parents...

197
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,787
and we told them to buy it.

198
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,706
The Sharp Professor is us!

199
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,541
That's our ass, Roger's and mine.

200
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,043
You'll work it out.
You always have before.

201
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,753
Look, I appreciate
this isn't a world crisis—

202
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,423
- This is not a mass suicide.
- That'll be Roger.

203
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,966
Hello.

204
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,801
Yeah, sure, Roger, hold on.

205
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,386
It's Roger.

206
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,018
Hi, Rog.

207
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,897
Roger! Rog, calm down.
Calm down.

208
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,066
We'll work it out.
We always have before.

209
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,068
Well then nobody got hurt, right?

210
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,613
What we're talking about here
is a lot of scared people.

211
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,865
We're talking about recalling
the whole goddamn cereal.

212
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,910
Well, that's not too bad.
I mean, it certainly could be worse.

213
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,870
Hey, buddy, don't yell at me.

214
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,622
- It's your dye, not my-
- Roger!

215
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,124
...like there's
nothing wrong here!

216
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,834
Look, no harm was done...

217
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,796
and I'm sure, given time,
this whole thing will blow over.

218
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,673
We're having a special
board meeting next week, okay?

219
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,425
Special board meeting?

220
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,510
We're going to reassess our
position re the Professor.

221
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,512
- Sure, we can be there.
- You better be there.

222
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,890
You better start taking this
a little more seriously, too.

223
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,850
- I'm not kidding!
- Right.

224
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,896
To reassess our position
re the Professor.

225
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,359
We lost the Sharp account.

226
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,743
Brett!

227
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,854
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,064
Come here.

229
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,317
I can't see you anymore, Steve.

230
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,115
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

231
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,034
Just came by to tell you that.

232
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,957
Okay.

233
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,709
Can you tell me why?

234
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,504
Jesus, I don't know.

235
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,840
I got this terrific husband
and this terrific kid...

236
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,926
and here I am, screwing
around with the local stud.

237
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,887
No offense intended.

238
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,764
None taken.

239
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,474
What the hell's the matter?

240
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,810
It's just over, that's all.
I want it over.

241
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:20,565
It's not your fault.
It was just a stupid mistake.

242
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,695
Okay.

243
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,280
Whatever you want.

244
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,371
Sorry.

245
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,505
Hi, Punkin'.

246
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,048
Hi! Look what I made.

247
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,426
Hey, that's really nice.

248
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,137
What happened to you?

249
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,891
- Nothin'.
- Yeah? It doesn't look like nothing.

250
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,684
I got hit by a swing.

251
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,687
Come here. Let me make it better.

252
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,109
Well, over, done with, gone, right?

253
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,279
- Over, done with, gone.
- Okay, strap in.

254
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,587
Oh, you like this, huh?

255
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,172
It's fun!

256
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,719
Bum, bum, bum, bum

257
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,763
I see your heinie

258
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,098
It's nice and shiny

259
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,100
Ifyou don't hide it

260
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,311
I think I'll bite it

261
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,397
Daddy's home.

262
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,191
Yeah, so I see.

263
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,527
Okay, everybody out.

264
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,115
- Hi.
- Daddy!

265
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,700
My big guy.

266
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,871
- Home early, huh?
- Yeah.

267
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,624
- What happened to your head?
- Fell off the swing.

268
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,501
Pinto's doing that thing again.

269
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,461
I'll have to take it up to Camber's.

270
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,630
- Yeah, I've heard that one before.
- Come here.

271
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,340
- Would you like to play some baseball?
- Yeah.

272
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,050
- Would you?
- There's a load of groceries here, Tad.

273
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,386
That's yourjob.

274
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,179
No. Not today.

275
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,516
Go on. Go get your mitt.
You left it on the front lawn again.

276
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,559
- Go on.
- Okay.

277
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,730
So what did you do today?

278
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,318
Oh, you know, the usual.

279
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,404
Groceries, errands.

280
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,407
Yeah?

281
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,325
Roger come in today?

282
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,577
No, he's still in mourning
for the account.

283
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,638
What the hell is that?

284
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,307
It's an engine hoist.

285
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,560
You wanted one.

286
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,438
It's the new hydraulic hoist
you wanted.

287
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,523
You kept telling me you need one.

288
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,193
You tell me what the fuck
is up here, Charity.

289
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,029
Sit down and eat, and I will.

290
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,614
Can't you use it?

291
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,369
Damn well can't afford it.

292
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,764
I won the lottery.

293
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,733
$5,000.

294
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,697
When do we get it?

295
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,034
Two weeks. A little less.

296
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,374
Thanks.

297
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,794
I got you a present.

298
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,506
You give me one, Joe. Okay?

299
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,347
I want to go away
for a week with Brett...

300
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,475
to see my sister in Connecticut.

301
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,482
Boston?

302
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,569
What the hell
are you gonna do in Boston?

303
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,905
What makes you think
I could afford to go anyway?

304
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,075
Shit! You're rollin' in it.

305
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,454
You might have to dig out something
from the mattress is all.

306
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,957
You're kicking up your heels a little,
aren't you, Joey?

307
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,917
You're go right
to the Combat Zone...

308
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,420
see a couple of dirty movies
and try to get the clap.

309
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,174
You better look out, pervert,
or I'll sic my dog on you.

310
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,717
That dog?

311
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,385
You couldn't sic that dog on me...

312
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,722
if I was coming at you
with a straight razor in each hand.

313
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,809
What does your wife say about it?

314
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,061
She don't know.
She don't have to know.

315
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,646
Sure.

316
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,608
She's going to take the boy to visit
her sister. Gonna be gone a week.

317
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,700
You're going to spend the lump
ofthat lottery money, eh?

318
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,871
- Shit.
- Broads, booze, baseball.

319
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,790
I don't want to do it alone.
It's no fun. Come on!

320
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,130
I don't give a shit if I do.

321
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,301
Now you're talking.
Now you're talking!

322
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,174
You've come to get me!
You've come to get me!

323
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,427
How's my boy? You having
a good time at summer camp?

324
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,179
It's yucky.

325
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,558
Your mom said
you were having fun.

326
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,601
Well, you want
to go home, then?

327
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,646
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go. Over the shoulder.

328
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,773
Yeah. Home we go.

329
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,733
Think you can beat me
to the Jaguar?

330
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,443
Think you can beat me?

331
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,028
Come on.

332
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,441
God, you scared
the shit out of me.

333
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,026
I'm sorry.

334
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,237
How'd you get
in here anyway?

335
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,323
Finished with your table.
I brought it back.

336
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,950
It's all stripped, and it's
a beautiful piece ofwork.

337
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,911
Leave it on the back porch.

338
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,580
I already did.

339
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,833
Where's Tadpole?

340
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,710
He's upstairs sleeping.

341
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,423
Steve—

342
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,842
I miss you, okay?

343
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,510
You know, I miss touching you.

344
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,971
Please, Steve. Please.

345
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,556
Quit it!

346
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,899
Steve?

347
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,115
- God, it's my home!
- Stop it! What?

348
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,535
It's my goddamn home,
you bastard!

349
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,038
Bastard, it's my home!

350
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,748
What the hell
are you doing?

351
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,750
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

352
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,670
Just get out of here, okay?

353
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,923
Mommy! Mom—

354
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,428
- What happened?
- The milk spilled.

355
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,393
- Go out and ride your bike.
- Are you okay, Mommy?

356
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,145
- Go on.
- Yeah, honey, I'm okay. Go ride your bike.

357
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,525
I brought your table,
but I spilled some—

358
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,610
Steve.

359
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,129
Yes or no?

360
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,344
Yes.

361
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,923
Don't, you son of a—

362
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,972
What is it, Tad?

363
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,932
I don't want you to go.

364
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,101
Well, I'll be back.
I'll be back in ten days.

365
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,230
But I don't want
to go to day camp.

366
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,941
Well, why don't you give
that another day or two, all right?

367
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,153
Who's going to say
the monster words?

368
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,946
Mommy don't know them.

369
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,080
Come here.

370
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,801
See, Tad, the thing
about the monster words...

371
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,761
is they're written down.

372
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,263
That's the only way
your dad can know them...

373
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,433
so what I'll do
is copy them for you...

374
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,310
and then I'll tack them
on your bedroom wall...

375
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:51,357
and that way, your mom
can read them to you every night.

376
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,818
- Will you?
- I will.

377
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,945
I promise I'll do it
for you tonight.

378
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,616
Okay, Tad,
time for your nap.

379
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,119
I love you, sport.

380
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,665
Come on.

381
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,169
Did you fix it?

382
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,838
No, I don't have the tools.

383
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,216
Take it up to Joe Camber's.
It's only 7 miles.

384
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,884
Yeah, maybe.

385
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,136
I'll try and run it up Saturday
if I can get the time.

386
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,013
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

387
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,062
Cujo?

388
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,384
Cujo, what's the matter?

389
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,638
Cujo, it's me, Brett.

390
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,059
Take it easy, boy.

391
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,021
I'm not gonna hurt you.

392
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:17,312
I don't want you to go for ten days.
I don't want you to go for one day.

393
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,815
Tad, I'll be back before you know it.
Now give me a kiss.

394
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,700
I forgot to take
the Pinto into Camber's.

395
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,829
I'll take care of it.

396
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,379
Well, I'll see you.

397
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,844
Vic! Stay there!

398
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,569
I just wanted you
to know it was over.

399
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,946
I just wanted to be
sure that you knew that.

400
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,950
I can't make that it
never happened, Vic.

401
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,037
I can't make like it never
happened either, Donna.

402
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,705
I know. I know that.

403
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,875
So I don't know what
I'm going to do yet.

404
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,300
I don't know.

405
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,782
Get the rest
ofthe bags, Brett.

406
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,670
Mom?

407
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,548
Mom, I'm worried about Cujo.

408
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,633
I saw him this
morning in the fog.

409
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,343
He was all bloody.

410
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,387
He was dripping foam
at the mouth.

411
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,014
Think I better tell Dad.

412
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,641
No, you do no such thing.

413
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,936
Your father would just jump
on something like that.

414
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,272
You just leave him be, and he'll
come mooching around your dad...

415
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,566
and your dad will take care of him.

416
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,442
He loves Cujo.

417
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,612
- Yeah. I guess he would.
- Tell you what.

418
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,365
We'll call your
father tonight.

419
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,450
When you talk
to him, you say...

420
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,995
sort of casually...

421
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,915
"You feeding my dog, Daddy?"

422
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,377
- Then you'll know.
- Yeah.

423
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,962
Brett!

424
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,361
Cujo.

425
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,155
What are you growling at?

426
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,764
Come on!

427
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,684
Come on!
I don't give a shit!

428
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,770
Hear me?
I don't give a shit!

429
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,324
You ought to be dead,
you stupid son of a bitch.

430
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,842
Cujo!

431
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,732
Shit.

432
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,345
Gary!

433
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,809
Hey, Gary!

434
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,414
Gary?

435
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:00,882
Gary!

436
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,398
Oh, shit!

437
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,569
Gary.

438
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,131
Cujo.

439
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,844
Oh, my God, you're rabid.

440
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,226
Easy, boy. Easy, Cujo.

441
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,616
One rolled over

442
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,493
And the other one said

443
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,078
Bum, bum, bum, bum

444
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,913
I see a heinie

445
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,666
It's nice and shiny

446
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,584
Ifyou don't hide it

447
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,753
I think I'll bite it

448
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,508
Alice stepped in the bathtub

449
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,677
Pulled out the plug, and then

450
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,595
Oh my goodness!
Oh, my soul!

451
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,389
There goes Alice
down the hole!

452
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,808
Glub, glub, glub

453
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,108
Come on, baby.

454
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,985
Just a little more to go.

455
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,901
Well, I think
we've arrived, Tadder.

456
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,321
Yeah, but is anybody home?

457
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,407
I don't know. We'll see.

458
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,205
Hello?

459
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,379
- I can't get my seat belt off.
- Hello!

460
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,554
Just great. This is great.

461
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,644
I can't get my damn
old seat belt off.

462
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,646
All right. I'm coming.

463
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,316
You're so impatient.

464
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,736
Damn button's stuck again.

465
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,655
Everything in this car is broken.

466
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,991
I wish Daddy'd get a new car.

467
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,743
Well, sounds good to me.

468
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,705
Damn this car.

469
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,457
You pull while I push.

470
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,962
Oh, I can't get it.

471
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,547
Pull!

472
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,630
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

473
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,012
It's the monster
from out of my closet!

474
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,348
Oh, there's no monster.

475
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,600
He got out of my closet!

476
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,436
Oh, baby.

477
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,105
How'd the monster
get out of my closet?

478
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,232
Listen to me. It's not a monster.

479
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,817
It's just a doggy.

480
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,801
Okay.

481
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,971
Okay, the doggy's gone.

482
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,556
See, the doggy's gone.

483
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,517
All right, we're going
to go home right now.

484
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,520
- I want to go home!
- We're going right now.

485
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,065
Oh, God.

486
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,817
Damn this car!

487
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,656
- Oh, I want to go home!
- Okay, listen to me!

488
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,868
We can't go home
right now, okay?

489
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,621
- We have to wait—
- I want to go home!

490
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,415
Tad, we have to let— Okay.

491
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,501
We have to let the engine—

492
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,169
I want to go home!

493
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,255
Okay. We'll go home.

494
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,717
Okay, we're going to go
home in a few minutes.

495
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,307
We'll go home
in a few minutes.

496
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,364
Mom, aren't we going?

497
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,367
Ma!

498
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,246
Yeah, okay. We'll try it.

499
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,041
Cross your fingers.

500
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,544
Come on, baby. One more time.

501
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,178
Great! It's fixed!
We're gonna go home!

502
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,359
Fuck you, dog.

503
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,550
Come on, damn it, turn over.

504
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,680
God damn you! Come on!

505
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,559
God, why didn't you
get this car fixed!

506
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,403
Mommy, are you okay?

507
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,700
Yeah.

508
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:49,535
I thought you were mad at me.

509
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:54,457
No, baby, never at you.

510
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,966
Can he get us in here?

511
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,475
Can he eat his way in here?

512
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,060
Can he?

513
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,108
I wish he would die.

514
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,528
Me, too.

515
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,187
Mommy?

516
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,772
What?

517
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,356
I gotta go pee.

518
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,653
- Yeah? Tadder, you gotta go bad?
- Yes.

519
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,238
Real bad?

520
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:56,120
Okay, look. We're going to open
this doorjust a little crack, okay?

521
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,206
You pee right outside here.

522
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,836
- Why can't we go outside?
- Because it's too cold.

523
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,547
Get your pants down. Ready?

524
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,132
Okay.

525
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,717
Okay, go quick.

526
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,073
Zip up your pants, Tad.

527
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,517
Don't open the window.

528
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,978
Just gonna open a little
bit for some air.

529
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,859
What's that?

530
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,444
The monster words.

531
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,655
Oh, let me see.

532
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,198
Please?

533
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,075
I'll give them right back.

534
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,080
- Is there any more drink?
- Oh, baby.

535
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,626
We gotjust a little bit left,
and I think we ought to save it, okay?

536
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,753
Can you wait? Just for a while?

537
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,589
- Yeah.
- Good. Thank you.

538
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,343
Can I have my
monster words back?

539
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:41,929
Okay.

540
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,518
"You have no business here.

541
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,854
No monsters under Tad's bed.

542
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:53,149
You can't fit under there.

543
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:56,777
No monsters hiding
in Tad's closet.

544
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,946
It's too small in there.

545
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:02,658
No monsters outside
ofTad's window.

546
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,536
You can't hold on out there.

547
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,122
No vampires, no werewolves...

548
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,749
nothing that bites.

549
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,709
You have no business here."

550
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,422
Maybe it will start now.

551
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:21,427
I'm afraid to try it
because the battery is so weak.

552
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:26,057
What does it matter
ifthe battery's weak or not?

553
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,808
We're just sitting here.

554
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,186
Try it.

555
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,771
Please?

556
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:34,482
Okay.

557
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,082
Told you.

558
01:01:55,504 --> 01:01:58,547
Don't worry. When the mailman comes,
we'll go home.

559
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,144
Just lay them out like this.

560
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,729
Okay.

561
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,233
- George.
- Yeah?

562
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,611
Hold mail until notified.

563
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,406
The Cambers.
Remember, George?

564
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,574
My mind's going.

565
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,993
Thanks, Roger.
You saved me a trip.

566
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,265
Get back in that barn, damn you.

567
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,262
Oh, my God.

568
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,800
It makes him angry.

569
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:28,322
Baby.

570
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,115
Quiet. Please be quiet.

571
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,918
I want to go home.

572
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:45,005
Oh, Mom wants to go
home very much, too.

573
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,177
I know, baby.

574
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,433
Nothing wrong here.

575
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,319
This is ridiculous.

576
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,113
We need a whole new campaign.

577
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,198
Start from scratch, huh, Vic?

578
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,619
What? I'm sorry.

579
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:18,205
Cut it, Frank.
We're wasting our time.

580
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,749
Where are you going?

581
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,501
I need some sugar.

582
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,186
Tadder?

583
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,887
Oh, shit.

584
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,480
Mommy! Mommy!

585
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,984
Let me see!

586
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,570
Mommy!

587
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:03,907
Okay, baby.

588
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,576
I want to go home.

589
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,661
Listen.

590
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,246
Listen, Tad.

591
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,959
- Tad, listen.
- I want to go home.

592
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,919
Don't get out of the car.

593
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,369
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
-Just wanted you to know.

594
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,581
- Roger, I have to go back.
- Go back? Go home?

595
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,708
You can't do that.
This whole damn thing was your idea.

596
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,460
- You can't do that to me.
- I know, Roger.

597
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,421
- I'm sorry. But I can't stay.
- Look, Vic, I understand.

598
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,089
I know what you're going through.

599
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,133
- You do?
- Of course.

600
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,260
You think I'm so wrapped up
in my own problems...

601
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:08,305
I can't see what's happening to you?
I see it, believe me.

602
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,474
- It happens to everyone.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

603
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,976
Oh, you can't come up with an
answer to the Sharp account...

604
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:14,561
so you think you're through.

605
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:16,813
You think the creative juice is gone.

606
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,399
It's panic, that's all, just panic.

607
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,280
Hey, what did I say?

608
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,324
Vic, what is eating you?

609
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,246
Donna's been having an affair.

610
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,918
Before I left, she told
me she had quit it.

611
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,379
Roger, she hasn't answered
the phone in two days.

612
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,006
Shit.

613
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,217
I'm going back.

614
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,969
I'm sorry.

615
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:50,931
Look, maybe she's spending
the night with a friend.

616
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,599
Oh, I can't believe I said that.

617
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,309
Call someone. Call the police.

618
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:57,688
- Have them go over and take a look.
- That's not the point.

619
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:01,525
Goddamn it, Vic, you can't
run out on the Sharp account.

620
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,110
Wanna bet?

621
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,012
Please, God, get me out of here.

622
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,434
Please get me out of here.

623
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,390
Tad.

624
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,812
Tadder, wake up.

625
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,575
Oh, my God.

626
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,160
Tad, wake up.

627
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,456
Oh, my God.

628
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:31,842
Now breathe. Breathe!

629
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,594
Give me your tongue.

630
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,728
Come on, breathe. Breathe!

631
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,647
Breathe! Come on!

632
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,109
Tad, talk to me!

633
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,944
I want to go home.

634
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,364
Tad, talk.

635
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,199
Four little monkeys

636
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:57,784
Laying on a bed

637
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,121
One rolled over
and the other one said

638
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,041
I see your heinie
Nice and shiny

639
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,626
Right?

640
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:10,088
Then I think I'll bite

641
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,673
Okay.

642
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:28,648
Is anybody home?

643
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:37,407
Donna?

644
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:42,389
We got two of everybody on that list,
didn't we, Bannerman?

645
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:45,225
Did we ever reach Missus—
What was her name?

646
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,895
- Her friend in Reardon.
- I said yes.

647
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,314
I am telling you, it was Kemp.
All right?

648
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,900
This was Kemp who did this.

649
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:56,987
Where's your wife's car,
Mr. Trenton?

650
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,571
Her what?

651
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,824
Bothers me.
Kemp came here, right?

652
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,742
He grabs your wife and son.

653
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:07,163
Why? Well, he's crazy,
which is reason enough.

654
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,832
Where's her car?

655
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,334
It's in the shop at Camber's.
The needle valve is sticking.

656
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,253
-Joe Camber's?
- Yes. Joe Camber.

657
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,588
- She was going to take it in.
- When would that have been?

658
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,674
- I don't know.
- I'll check it out.

659
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:23,013
Wait. What are you
going to do about Kemp?

660
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,015
We've got an MV alert out on him.

661
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,766
We'll pick him
up soon enough.

662
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,518
Kemp is taken care of.

663
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,372
Oh, Tad.

664
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:37,916
Not now!

665
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,959
Oh, please, not now.

666
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,753
Please. Please.

667
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,216
Breathe!

668
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,800
Not now!

669
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,722
I want my daddy.

670
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:55,099
- Okay. Okay.
- I want my daddy.

671
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,310
I'll get your daddy.
Oh, my God.

672
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,771
I want my daddy!

673
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:08,321
I want my daddy.

674
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:11,074
I want my daddy!

675
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,368
All right, I'll get your daddy!

676
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,684
Mr. Trenton?

677
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,936
They picked up Kemp.

678
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,479
Are they all right?

679
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:43,606
Well, your wife and son
weren't with him.

680
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,775
He claims that he
never even saw them.

681
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,027
Oh, bullshit.
You don't believe that, do you?

682
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,113
Not after what he
did to the house.

683
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,198
Well, that's the thing.

684
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:54,284
He admits that he
trashed the house...

685
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:55,994
and his story checks.

686
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,580
Tell you the truth,
I believe him.

687
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,960
What did Bannerman say?

688
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,670
Well, he—

689
01:22:06,714 --> 01:22:09,549
He's probably following up some lead.

690
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,051
We'll be hearing
from him any time now.

691
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,597
Wait a minute.
You haven't heard from him yet?

692
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,473
He hasn't even called in?

693
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,414
Tad, baby.

694
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,420
Oh, baby, wake up.

695
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:55,154
Dear God, save my baby.

696
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,534
I'm losing my baby.

697
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,584
Well, come on, then!

698
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,406
Oh, my God.

699
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,404
Oh, breathe!

700
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:28,469
Oh, yes!

701
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,429
Yes, baby!

702
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:36,060
Yes, my baby!

703
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:35,578
Donna?

704
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:37,955
Donna!
