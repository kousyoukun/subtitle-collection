That's great. Now I'm gonna smoke your ass.

132
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:56,367
轮到我吗?
It's my shot, right?

133
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,777
来吧  约翰
Come on, John.

134
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:01,167
把桌子抹了
Wipe off the tables.

135
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:05,167
够了  真的够了
This is it. This is really it.

136
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:07,867
没什么可比性了
I mean,

137
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,467
我想我该走了
here I go.

138
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,977
伙计  不必装得太轻松
There's no sense in gettin' too relaxed, buddy.

139
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,677
-告诉我这是真的  -来吧
-Let me know that it's real -Come on.

140
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,697
你这个同性恋
You faggot.

141
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,667
你
You

142
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:42,167
我的天啊
Jesus Christ!

143
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:45,757
你竟然这么冷血地对你母亲
To do this to your own mother...

144
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,267
她为你一生祈祷
who prays for you all her life.

145
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,767
你真是这么残忍无情吗?
Is your heart so cruel, so unfeeling?

146
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:55,007
你娶了这女人回来  留下她给我
You marry this girl. You leave her with me.

147
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:58,207
然后跟这群无赖去越南
And you go with these bums to the Vietnam!

148
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:00,377
-狗屁
-Bullshit.

149
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,577
如果这相当好
And if it's quite all right

150
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,807
飞一次  只要在天上飞一次
One flight! It's one flight upstairs!

151
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:09,807
我回来时  只飞一次
When I come home-One flight.

152
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:11,717
我爱安琪拉
I love Angela.

153
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,417
她也爱我
And she loves me.

154
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,477
今天你得扣上围巾
Wear a scarf today!

155
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:25,267
穿燕尾服怎可扣围巾
You don't wear a scarf with a tuxedo.

156
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:29,017
我不会扣围巾的
I'm not gonna wear a scarf with a tuxedo.

157
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:23,437
-你想扮成王子吗? -什么意思  扮?
-You tryin' to look like a prince? -What do you mean trying?

158
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,587
你早该预备好
You should've done that a long time ago.

159
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,007
-它是那样设计的  -我知道
-That way, it would've set. -I know.

160
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:33,337
-那么  你为何不照做呢  -因为我忘了
-Then why didn't you do it? -'Cause I forgot.

161
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:40,207
看见了吗?
Oh, man.

162
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:43,107
迈克  还有几个小时  史蒂夫就结婚了
Steven's gettin' married in a couple of hours.

163
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:46,447
我不明白我们到底为什么居然讨论参军前最后一次狩猎
We're talkin' about huntin' the last time before the army.

164
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:51,147
整件事都  有点疯狂
The whole thing, it's crazy.

165
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:53,717
让我告诉你一件事
I'll tell ya one thing.

166
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:56,547
如果我命中注定要死在山中
If I found out my life had to end up in the mountains,

167
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:58,517
那都无所谓
I'd be all right.

168
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,547
但是你得紧记
But it has to be in your mind.

169
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,797
什么
What?

170
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,797
一击即中
One shot?

171
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:10,067
第二枪就太逊了
Two is pussy.

172
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,367
我不会为一击即中  想太多的  迈克
I don't think about one shot that much anymore, Mike.

173
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:15,107
你一定要  一击即中就是重点
You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about.

174
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,067
射杀鹿只要一枪
A deer has to be taken with one shot.

175
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:20,107
我一直在说服大家  他们都不听
I try to tell people that. They don't listen.

176
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:27,507
-你真的想去越南吗? -是
-You really think about Vietnam? -Yeah.

177
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,877
我不知道
I don't know. I guess.

178
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:35,517
当我想着鹿时  就想去越南
I'm thinkin' about the deer. Going to Nam.

179
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,977
你知道我喜欢树吗?
I like the trees, you know?

180
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:43,017
我喜欢树在山上的样子  每棵都不同
I like the way the trees are in the mountains, all the different

181
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,317
各式各样的树
The way the trees are.

182
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:53,017
说来像个笨蛋  是吗?
I sound like some asshole, right?

183
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:58,287
听我说  尼克  你是我  唯一想要结伴打猎的人
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy I go huntin' with, you know?

184
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:01,517
我喜欢跟动作快  速度快的人打猎
I like a guy with quick moves and speed. I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

185
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,827
-我才不愿意跟笨蛋打猎  -那么谁是笨蛋
-Well, who's an asshole? -Who's an asshole?

186
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:06,437
你想会是谁
Who do you think's an asshole?

187
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:08,987
他们全都是笨蛋
They're all a bunch of assholes.

188
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:11,087
不过我也喜欢他们  他们是好人
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys,

189
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,027
但是  如果没有你  我就一人去
but without you, I'd hunt alone.

190
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:16,927
-我是认真的  我真的会这么做  -你真是个疯子
-Seriously, that's what I'd do. -Well, you're a fuckin' nut.

191
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,927
迈克  知道吗? 你是个狂人  你有控制狂
You know that, Mike. You're a maniac, control freak.

192
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:22,927
我喜欢意外惊喜
I just don't like no surprises.

193
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:29,727
-烂车打不开的  -那么  踢它一脚
-Damn thing won't open. -Well, give it a kick.

194
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,937
不是这样的  不是这样的
Hey, man, hey, hey, not like that. Not

195
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,597
踢这  这  这里
Here, here, here.

196
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:36,837
-看到没有  -操
-See that? -Fuckin' A.

197
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,797
不是真的
Unreal.

198
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:46,437
艾素  我终于知道  为何不支持飞云队
Axel, now I know why you're not still kicking for the Steelers.

199
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:49,157
你知道  我一直喜欢迈克的车
You know, I love Mike's car.

200
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:51,807
对呀  有些车只会抛锚
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.

201
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:55,537
我是说你永远不会理解一个将会带你到见鬼的地方去的车
You never know with a car like this where the hell it's gonna take you.

202
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:59,147
是呀  它使我感到安全
Yeah. It makes me feel safe.

203
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,007
哦  他在做什么?
Oh, what is he doing?

204
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:09,047
艾素在溜迈克的车
Axel's humping Mike's Coupe de Ville.

205
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:15,347
噢  艾素  走开  我去拿康乃馨  他们已到齐了
-Axel, get out of there. -Let's get the carnations.

206
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:18,617
起来  起来  你在干什么
Get up. Get up. What are you doing?

207
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:22,217
快点  坐好  别想过  艾素
Come on. Sit up. Oh, God, you're impossible.

208
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,757
带着它  你得把这个扣上  寒酸的燕尾服
-Here, put this on, you have to have that on. -Crummy tuxedo.

209
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,717
这个燕尾服老是被卡住
Tuxedo's been stuck a million times.

210
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:32,117
哪里得来的  一点也不好笑
-Where'd you get this thing? It's not funny.

211
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,557
我很漂亮  对吧  不  不漂亮
-I'm beautiful, right? I'm beautiful. -No, you're not.

-All set. -Thanks, Amy.

213
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:48,427
艾素  怎么坐不稳
You can't even sit up, Axel. Oh!

214
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:52,157
-来  坐直  -漂亮
-Axel, come on. Sit up. -Beautiful.

215
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:00,667
琳达  怎么了  我正想去接你
Linda, what's the matter? I was gonna pick you up.

216
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:02,727

Hey, wait a minute, goddamn it.

220
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,637
你不能就这样走开  你脸上的是什么鬼东西
You don't walk away from me. What is that on your face?

221
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:21,067
你和迈克过几天便要走了
Nicky, you and Michael, you're goin' away in a couple of days.

222
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,377
我想我还能不能住在这里
I was just wonderin' if I could use this place to stay.

223
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:28,337
-当然可以  -我会付钱给你们

Hey, Kochatka, it's me you're talking to.

227
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:47,377
难道你对我的了解还不够深吗?
You know, how long have you known me for?

228
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,547
什么意思
What?

我一定是疯了
I must be out of my mind.

415
00:51:51,797 --> 00:51:54,697
事情来得太快了
I don't know. Everything's going so fast.

416
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,217

429
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:40,377
喂  尼克  嗯

431
00:53:53,837 --> 00:53:57,337
我记不住其他的词了
I don't remember the rest of the words.

432
00:53:57,377 --> 00:53:59,307
没事的
So let me be free

433
00:54:03,027 --> 00:54:04,047
狗屁的  有点恐怖
Chickenshit, get scared.

434

不要推
Oh, boy.

435
00:54:21,147 --> 00:54:23,047

Fuckin' cold.

欠我36杯酒
Thirty-six beers.

好的  我会继续
All right, I'll go on, already.

439
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:35,457
等一等
Wait, wait.

440
00:54:39,657 --> 00:54:44,657
你能一边尿  一边喝酒
You ever piss and take a drink of beer at the same time?

441
00:54:48,257 --> 00:54:50,257
哇
Whoa.

442
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:55,457
我只能勉强地撒尿
Ah, I just barely got a chance to shake it off.

443
00:54:55,497 --> 00:54:57,367
等一等  来吧  该死
Wait! Come on! Oh, fuck!

444
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,867
婊子养的
Bastards!

445
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,267
婊子养的
Sons of bitches!

446
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:44,877
-你跟我们同路吗? -来吧
-You guys goin' my way? -Come on.

447
00:55:50,977 --> 00:55:52,887
操
Fuck!

448
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:00,187
一点也不好玩
That's not funny!

449
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:19,697
不要再闹了  走吧
No fuckin' around now.

450
00:56:21,697 --> 00:56:24,697
不要再闹了
Come on. Stick around. Don't fuck around.

451
00:56:26,197 --> 00:56:28,197
不要再闹了
All right? No fuckin' around.

452
00:56:56,507 --> 00:56:59,507
-放我出去  放我出去  -出去  出去
-Lemme out! Lemme out! -Out, out. Get out.

453
00:57:04,107 --> 00:57:06,077
不对  肯定不对
This is not it. Definitely.

454
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:08,107
他们换了  不是开玩笑
-They changed it. -No kidding.

455
00:57:08,147 --> 00:57:10,077
有人换了
Somehow they changed it.

456
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:14,707
-像每年都会发生的  -斯丹尼  你真是狗屁
-Like this happens every goddamn year. -You're full of shit, Stanley.

00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:17,517
-你说谁狗屁  -你放狗屁
-Who did you say was full of shit? -You're full of shit.

458
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:21,217
-你总是放狗屁  -我饿了
-You're always full of shit. -I'm starvin'.

459
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:22,477
吃这个吧
Eat that.

460
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:23,877
喂  尼克  我问你一个问题
Hey, nock.Can I ask you a question?

461
00:57:24,117 --> 00:57:26,477
为什么我从来不见你吃东西
Nick, how come I never see you eatin'?

462
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:29,187
我喜欢挨饿  保持惊恐状态
I like to starve myself. Keeps the fear up.

463
00:57:29,217 --> 00:57:32,617
-这是违反自然  来吧  约翰  -喂  那是我的
-It ain't natural. Come on, John. -Hey! That's mine.

464
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,987
-你真的很想要吗? -你说得真对
-You really want it that bad? -You're goddamn right.

-那是芥末  -什么
-That's mustard! -What?

467
00:57:51,407 --> 00:57:54,787
他把这个和芥末一起吃
He put mustard on his Twink

468
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:57,677
你说话好像该死的交通警察一样
You're talkin' like a goddamn traffic cop.

469
00:57:57,717 --> 00:58:00,767
-不可思议  -迈克  给我一瓶酒
-Oh, fuck--Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:06,427
-我在这鬼地方干什么  -完全不对
-What the hell am I doing with you? -This is not it.

472
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:09,197
变了  他们把这儿改变了
They changed it. Somehow they changed it.

473
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:13,237
-即使用双手也找不到自己屁股  -操
-You couldn't find your own ass with two hands. -Fuckin' A.

474
00:58:13,437 --> 00:58:18,137
你明白的  我们忘了为史蒂夫和安琪拉举杯
Hey, you know, we forgot to toast Steven and Angela.

475
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,337
敬史蒂夫和安琪拉
Steven and Angela!

476
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:24,837
干杯
Na zdorovije!

477
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:30,937

478
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:34,507
别逗我笑  我在吃东西
Don't make me laugh when I have things in my mouth.

479
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:37,137
我不能带你们到其它地方  你想怎样  哼
I can't take you guys anyplace. What the hell you doin'?

480
00:58:37,177 --> 00:58:39,507
不要碰那该死的面包
Get your hands off the fuckin' bread.

481
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:42,047
你可以把他装扮好  但不能带他走
You can dress 'em up, but you can't take 'em anywhere.

482
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:44,007
喂  好了  好了
Oh, come on. Come on!

483

486
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:01,347
艾素  你真是满口污言秽语
You know, Axel, you got a terrific vocabulary.

487
00:59:01,387 --> 00:59:04,167

Watch the rifle. Axel, gimme my bag.

489
00:59:09,657 --> 00:59:11,557
越来越冷了  嗯
It's gettin' cold, huh?

490
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,427
喂  迈克  有多双保暖长袜吗?
Hey, Mike, you got any extra thermal socks?

491
00:59:18,577 --> 00:59:19,787
去你妈的

492
00:59:22,027 --> 00:59:25,327
喂  迈克  有多双保暖长袜吗?
Hey, Mike, you got any extra thermal socks?

493
00:59:26,527 --> 00:59:28,427
算了吧  我找到了
Never mind. I got 'em.

494
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,827
我的靴子在哪儿
Where the hell's my boots?

495
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:37,297
有谁看到我的靴子
Anybody see my boots?

496
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:40,737
谁拿了我的靴子  我特价时买的
Somebody took my boots. I bought 'em special.

497
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:46,537
好了  不管是谁拿的  现在还我
All right. All right, you guys. Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

498
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:50,237
我有一双靴子给你  斯丹尼  在你的屁股下面
I got a boot for you, Stan, right up your ass.

499
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:52,137
喂  迈克
Hey, Mike.

500
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:57,437
可以把你的备用借我吗?
Hey, Mike, lemme borrow your spares, huh?

501
00:59:57,477 --> 01:00:00,437
-你的备用的吗? -不好  斯丹尼
-Your extra pair? -No, Stan.

502
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:02,437
不好
No?

503
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:08,047
-什么叫不好  -不好就是不好
-What do you mean, No? -Just what I said. No. No means no.

504
01:00:10,147 --> 01:00:13,347
你真是个该死的朋友  知道吗?
Some fuckin' friend. You're some fuckin' friend, you know that?

505
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:16,447
每次来到这儿  你总是装出一脸的高傲
Every time you come here, you got your head up your ass.

506
01:00:16,477 --> 01:00:19,947
可能他觉得高高在上够威风吧
Maybe he likes the view from up there.

507
01:00:23,947 --> 01:00:27,147
每次到来  他既是没刀  没夹克
Every time he comes up, he's got no knife, no jacket.

508
01:00:27,187 --> 01:00:29,517
没裤子或没靴子
He's got no pants, no boots.

509
01:00:29,547 --> 01:00:33,047
他只记着那支呆枪  真像约翰因演的呆子警察
All he's got is that stupid gun he carries like John Wayne.

510
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,017
那帮不了你
That ain't gonna help ya.

511
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:37,817
见鬼的  迈克  借给他吧
Oh, what the hell, Mike. Give him the boots.

512
01:00:37,857 --> 01:00:41,857
休想  我绝对不会把靴子借给他  绝不
No, I ain't givin' him no boots. No more. That's it.

513
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:45,857
你真是混蛋  哼
You're a fuckin' bastard, you know that? Huh?

514
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:47,917
斯丹尼  你明白吗?
Stanley, see this? This is this.

515
01:00:47,957 --> 01:00:51,157
完了  就这样
This ain't somethin' else. This is this.

516
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:54,057
现在开始  你得靠自己了
From now on, you're on your own.

517
01:00:57,757 --> 01:01:00,257
我帮了你多少次
I fixed you up a million times.

518
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:02,727
我帮了他不知道多少次
I fixed him up a million times.

519
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:05,167
有多少次因为我的帮忙  那些女人
I don't know how many times I must've fixed him up with girls.

520
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:07,827
才没发生意外  零次
And nothin' ever happened. Zero.

521
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:11,517
喂  迈克  你知道你的问题吗? 没人明白你的鬼话
You know your trouble, Mike? Nobody ever knows what you're talkin' about.

522
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:15,167
哼  什么叫完了  他到底想说什么  什么完了
This is this.  What the hell's that supposed to mean? This is this.

523
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:18,167
完了  听来像娘娘腔的狗屁话
Is that faggot-soundin' bullshit, or is that faggot-soundin'

524
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,437
斯丹尼  闭嘴  你太过火了
Shut up, Stan, will ya? Hey, man, you're outta line.

525
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:24,637
小心你的枪  斯丹尼
Watch out with that gun, Stan. Watch out with the gun.
