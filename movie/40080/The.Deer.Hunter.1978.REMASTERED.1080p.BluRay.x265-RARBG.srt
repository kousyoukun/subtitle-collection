你听说过快乐的罗马人吗？　　-啥？

12
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:28,876
他很快乐，因为他把她吃了
- He was "glad he ate her". - Come on. Let's go, let's go.

艾索，史丹在那　　-嗨，史丹

快点，史丹，你够帅了
Come on, Stosh. You're beautiful now.

31
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,916
你仍然是最丑的混蛋，史丹
You're still an ugly bastard, Stan!

32
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,585
祝你在军中好运

很成熟，非常成熟
Very mature. Very mature, well-adapted individual, Stosh.

39
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,626
没人像你们这么成熟

40
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:30,917
小心点
- Take it easy. - Whoa.

41
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:33,793
嘿，看那里　　-我们走，快点
Hey! Look at that! Whoa! What the hell is that?

42
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,084
那是什么东西啊？

43
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:37,502
哪里？看到了
Where? Oh, yeah.

44
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,208
见鬼了，你知道那是什么吗？
Holy shit. You know what that is? Those are sun dogs.

45
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,834
那是太阳犬

46
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:44,335
什么意思？
What does it mean?

47
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,584
天上的大狼为了保佑他的后代
It means a blessing on the hunter sent by the great wolf to his children.

48
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:47,752
赐福给猎人的象征
- What the fuck are you talking about? - No, it's an old Indian thing.

49
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,752
听你在放屁

50
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,377
才不是，这是古老的印地安传说

51
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,042
听你在放屁
You're full of shit.

52
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,710
史丹，这种事情我有骗过你吗？
Stanley, would I shit you about something like that?

53
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,752
你知道吗，麦可
You know, Mike,

54
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,459
有时候只有医生才了解你
there's times when nobody but a doctor can understand you.

55
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,126
那是一个预兆，你知道吗？
And that's an omen, you know that?

56
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:07,377
你知道，今晚猎鹿之旅一定会很棒的
You know that we could have one great fucking hunting trip tonight?

57
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:10,166
麦可，我不知道你是怎么想出
You know, Mike, I don't know where the hell you come up with all this shit.

58
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,166
这些鬼东西的
Hey, wait a minute.

59
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,166
等一下

60
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,876
你们到底在想什么啊，今晚要去猎鹿？
What, are you...? Are you thinking of going deer hunting tonight?

61
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,751
不，今晚不行，今晚我要结婚
Ah, not tonight. I'm getting married tonight. You fucking guys would go deer hunting.

62
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:22,459
而你们这些家伙要去猎鹿？　　-安啦
Hey, hey. First we get you legal. Tuck you in bed with Angela.

63
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,875
我们会先让你完婚

64
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,335
让你先上了安琪拉的床

65
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:28,542
你们这群疯子　　-我们是疯子？
You guys are all fucking nuts, you know that?

66
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:30,584
你们都疯了　　-这一生完蛋了
- Boy, you're all crazy. - Life is over.

67
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,083
说的对
Right. You're getting married. We're crazy.

68
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,083
你要结婚了，而我们都疯了？

69
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,627
没关系
It's all right. Hey...

70
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,166
没关系的，我们都会去
It's all right. We'll be right there. We'll be right with you, all of us, won't we?

71
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,376
我们全部人都会陪你一起，对吗？

72
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,418
真他妈的对极了　　-没错
Right? Am I right?

73
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,501
- Right. - Fuckin' A, man.

74
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,751
来吧
Come on. Come on, you guys.

75
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,626
来吧，今天早上的第一轮酒算我的
- I'm buying the first round this morning. - Hey, Steven! Steven!

76
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:48,000
嘿，史帝夫！史帝夫！
Any help you might need tonight, just feel free to call on me.

77
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,501
今晚如果你需要帮助的话

78
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,502
随时打给我

79
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,459
史丹，有时你的笑话一点都不好笑
Oh...

80
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,584
Hey, Stanley, sometimes your sense of humour ain't funny.

81
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,542
得了吧，史帝夫
- Come on, Steven. - Willing fingers.

82
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,958
自愿被套牢的手指
Extra lips.

83
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,460
又一张嘴要养

84
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:00,792
真他妈的对极了
Fuckin' A, man.

85
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,584
嘿，你简直是诗人，艾索
- Hey, you're a regular poet, Axel. - I couldn't agree with you more.

86
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,585
我完全同意你说的

87
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,335
进去吧　　-快点，快点
- Get in the car. - Come on. Come on.

88

我愿意
I do.

91
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,585
我的天啊！
Oh, my God.

92
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,335
我还是不敢相信
I still do not believe this.

93
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,585
我的儿子和这个奇怪的女孩在一起
My own boy with a strange girl.

94
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,083
她一点也不瘦，如果你懂我的意思
And not so thin, if you understand my meaning.

95
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:57,834
她是带球走
Not such a thin girl.

96
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,418
然后你知道，他要去越南了
The next thing you know, he goes to Vietnam.

97
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,126
（俄语）

98
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,834
我不明白，神父
I do not understand, Father.

99
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,543
我完全都不明白
I understand nothing anymore.

100
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,042
一点都不
Nothing!

101
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,792
Oh!

102
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:18,293
为什么？
Why?

103
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,293
你能解释一下吗？
Can you explain?

104
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,751
有谁能解释吗？
Can anyone explain?

105
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:37,792
（俄语）

106
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:55,708
从内线超过他
- Pass him on the inside. - Oh-ho, you'd never do it.

107
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,127
你办不到的
Shut the hell up. I'm trying to concentrate.

108
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,958
闭嘴，我要专心
- It's your Caddy against my truck. - Today your lucky day?

109
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,542
我用我的货车当赌注

110
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:02,252
今天是你的幸运日？　　-你办不到的
You can't make it.

111
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:16,792
哇，好家伙！你办到了！

112
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,750
艾索，你打开车窗
- Whoa! Mike! - Hey, hey, Axel, you owe him a window.

113
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:25,875
麦可！伟大的麦可！
Mike! Hey, mighty Mike!

114
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,000
艾索！　　-货车还你
- Whoa, Axel. - Here's your truck back.

115
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,168
见鬼了！
- Oh, hell! I hope he didn't break an axle. - I wouldn't want to take advantage of you.

116
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,418
我希望你没弄断轮轴　　-不想占你便宜

117
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:32,666
艾索！
Axel!

118
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,958
这简直是万无一失，赢定了
It's a million-to-one shot against a sure thing.

119
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,875
没有什么事情是万无一失　　-对啦
- There's no such thing as a sure thing. - Yeah.

120
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,293
你看到了吗？
Did you see that?

121
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,085
你好吗？
- Hey, Boom! - Hey, how ya doin'?

122
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,501
不准收任何人的钱
Don't take anybody's money!

123
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,751
别跟我收钱，跟他收
- Don't take my money. Take his money. - Set 'em up.

124
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,417
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock. - Kessler and a Rolling Rock.

125
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:56,126
Give him a short one.

126
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,001
给我朋友们献上最深的祝福
And give my friends down here my warm regards.

127
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,709
约翰！

128
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:07,958
我赌一百元
Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles never cross the fifty in the next half.

129
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,834
老鹰队在下半场连50码都过不了

130
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:13,042
钢铁队会赢多少？20？
And the Steelers win by what? Twenty!

131
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:14,001
我再加20块
I got an extra twenty says the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!

132
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,042
赌老鹰队的四分卫是个娘娘腔

133
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,502
一言为定！
You got it!

134
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,126
一言为定！
Take your money off the bar. Drinks are on the house!

135
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,792
把钱都收起来，免费招待！

136
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:43,418
（俄语）

137
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,709
我弄湿了吗？　　-我不知道
- Oh, did I get all wet? - No. I don't know.

138
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,501
艾美！

139
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,252
快点，艾美
Come on, Amy!

140
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:05,501
快点
Come on!

141
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,959
你知道，乔，或许我们能多挂些旗子
Uh, Joe, maybe we could use some more flags.

142
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,127
这样可以吗？
- Is that all right? - Uh...

143
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:20,709
再上面一点，你觉得呢？
- Up a bit, I would say, wouldn't you say so? - Up!

144
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,916
不，不，下面一点
No, no, no, down.

145
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,210
喔，这蛋糕真漂亮！
Oh, what a beautiful cake. Here.

146
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,959
真该赏你们一杯
You've earned a drink.

147
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,210
蛋糕真漂亮
You have a beautiful cake.

148
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:40,001
Here!

149
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,335
我没忘了你
I haven't forgotten about you.

150
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,168
我也敬你一杯
I have one for you, too.

151
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:14,085
去死吧！
Go to... fucking hell.

152
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:20,335
我要把镇上的车全都放了气
I'll give every car in the town a flat tyre.

153
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,792
每一辆都该死　　-喔，爹地
- Every goddamn one. - Oh, Daddy.

154
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,417
我真的会
I'll do it!

155
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:32,709
他妈的我说到做到，ㄚ头　　-来吧
Yeah, I fucking mean what I say, girl.

156
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,959
Shh. Yes. Come on.

157
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:36,293
就像在海上摇晃　　-我的天！
- All around... like a sea. - Oh, my God.

158
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,584
整遍海都是破轮胎
Ocean of flat tyres.

159
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,959
他妈的…　　-不！
- Fucking... bitch. - No!

160
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,168
贱人！

161
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:46,377
都是贱女人
All bitches.

162
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,210
我恨他们　　-爹地
- I hate 'em. - Daddy.

163
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,293
爹地，不要！是我！　　-他妈的贱人
- Daddy, no, it's me! - Fucking bitches!

164
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,584
刺破他们的轮胎
Yeah! Give 'em all flat tyres.

165
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,251
<i>你是如此完美，就像梦幻一般</i>
? You're just too good to be true

166
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,584
<i>我无法将目光从你身上移开</i>　　-太棒了
- ? Can't take my eyes off you - That's great.

167
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,126
现在，我要打的你屁股开花
Now I'm gonna smoke your ass.

168
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,667
<i>你就像人们向往的天堂</i>
? You'd be like heaven to touch

169
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:44,583
<i>我多想拥抱着你</i>
? I wanna hold you so much

170
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,375
<i>爱情终于到来</i>
? At long last love has arrived

171
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:51,751
<i>感谢上帝我仍活着</i>
? And I thank God I'm alive

172
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:53,416
<i>你是如此完美，就像梦幻一般</i>
- ? You're just too good to be true - It's my shot, right?

173
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,918
该我了吗？

174
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:59,501
快点，约翰，终结这一局吧
- ? Can't take my eyes off of you - Come on, John.

175
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:03,293
就是这次，真的就是这一刻
Wipe off the tables.

176
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:03,459
- ? Pardon the way that I stare - This is it. This is really it.

177
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:09,417
我是说，我要结婚了
- ? There's nothing else to compare - I mean, here I go.

178
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,792
? The sight of you leaves me weak

179
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,459
<i>什么话都不必再说了</i>
? There are no words left to speak

180
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:18,375
也没必要装得太轻松吧，老兄
- ? But if you feel like I feel - No sense in getting too relaxed, buddy.

181
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,667
<i>请让我知道这一切都是真的</i>
- ? Please let me know that it's real - Come on.

182
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:25,376
<i>你是如此完美，就像梦幻一般</i>
? You're just too good to be true

183
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:29,085
<i>我无法将目光从你身上移开</i>
? Can't take my eyes off of you

184
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:33,709
? Ba-da, da-da, da-da, ba-ba-ba

185
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:37,459
? Ba-da, ba-da, ba-ba, da-da-da

186
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:41,501
? Ba-da, da-da, da-da, ba-ba-ba

187
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:45,292
? Ba-da, ba-da, da

188
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,625
<i>我爱你，宝贝</i>
? I love you, baby

189
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,500
<i>而如果可以的话</i>
? And if it's quite all right

190
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,375
<i>宝贝，我需要你</i>
? I need you, baby to warm the lonely night

191
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,251
<i>来温暖这孤独的夜晚</i>

192
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:56,834
<i>我爱你，宝贝</i>
? I love you, baby

193
00:15:56,835 --> 00:16:01,042
<i>当我说出下面话语时，请相信我</i>
? Trust in me when I say

194
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,751
<i>喔，漂亮的宝贝</i>
? Oh, pretty baby

195
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,625
<i>我请求你别让我失望</i>
? Don't bring me down, I pray

196
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,583
<i>喔，漂亮宝贝</i>
? Oh, pretty baby

197
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:09,375
<i>我终于找到你了，请留下</i>
? Now that I've found you, stay

198
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:12,834
<i>让我有机会爱你，宝贝</i>
? And let me love you, baby

199
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,458
<i>让我爱你</i>
- ? Let me love you - You faggot.

200
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:16,500
你这死同性恋
- ? You're just too good to be true - Bums!

201
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,708
<i>你是如此完美，就像梦幻一般</i>

202
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,877
流氓！
? Can't take my eyes off of you

203
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:23,709
<i>我无法将目光从你身上移开</i>

204
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,583
<i>你就像人们向往的天堂</i>
- ? You'd be like heaven to touch - Hey!

205
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,084
（俄语）
? I wanna hold you so much

206
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,251
<i>我多想拥抱着你</i>

207
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:35,376
? At long last love has arrived

208
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,334
? And I thank God I'm alive ?

209
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,625
我的天啊！
Jesus Christ!

210
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,876
你这样对待自己母亲
...to do this to your own mother

211
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,710
我这一生都在为你祈祷
who prays for you all her life!

212
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:50,168
你真的是没心没肺了吗？
Is your heart so cruel, so unfeeling?

213
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:53,625
你和这个女孩结婚，然后把她留给我
You marry this girl, you leave her with me,

214
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:56,501
再和这些流氓跑到越南去！
and you go with these bums to the Vietnam!

215
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,584
乱来！
- Ow. Ow. - Bullshit.

216
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,084
飞一下，飞一下就到了
One flight! It's one flight upstairs!

217
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:05,626
等我回家…
When I come home... one flight!

218
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,127
飞一下

219
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,752
我爱安琪拉
I love Angela.

220
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,334
她也爱我
And she loves me.

221
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,292
今天你要戴围巾
Wear a scarf today!

222
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:22,584
穿燕尾服没人戴围巾的啦
You don't wear a scarf with a tuxedo.

223
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,625
我才不要穿燕尾服戴围巾
I'm not gonna wear a scarf with a tuxedo.

224
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,542
（俄语）

225
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:21,542
你想假装成王子吗？　　-什么叫假装？
- You trying to look like a prince? - What do you mean, "trying"?

226
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,834
你早就该弄了，那样才会定型
You should've done that a long time ago. That way, it would've set.

227
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:26,835
我知道
I know.

228
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,458
那你为什么不做呢？
- Then why didn't you do it? - Cos I forgot.

229
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,835
因为我忘了

230
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,960
你还看得见吗？

231
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,209
Oh, man!

232
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,877
天啊！麦可
For Christ's sake, Mike, Steven's getting married in a couple of hours.

233
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:41,500
史帝夫还有几个小时就要结婚了

234
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:42,583
我不知道我们到底在做什么
I don't know what we're doing talking about hunting a last time before the army.

235
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:43,834
我们竟然在谈论当兵前…

236
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,043
最后一次去打猎的事
The whole thing, it's crazy.

237
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:48,292
这整件事情…实在是太疯狂了

238
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,459
我告诉你一件事
I'll tell you one thing.

239
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,793
如果我发现我会死在山上
If I found out my life had to end up in the mountains,

240
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,668
那也没关系
I'd be all right.

241
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:58,627
但是你心里必须记着
But it has to be in your mind.

242
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,585
记着什么？
What?

243
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,084
一枪毙命？
One shot?

244
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,416
两枪就太娘了
Two is pussy.

245
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:11,042
我不会再想着一枪毙命了，麦可
I don't think about one shot that much anymore, Mike.

246
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:12,416
你必须想着一枪毙命
You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about.

247
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,834
最重要的就是一枪毙命
A deer has to be taken with one shot.

248
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,751
猎鹿就是要一枪毙命

249
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:16,668
我一直要大家了解这一点
I try to tell people that. They don't listen.

250
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:17,877
可是他们不听

251
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:26,292
你真的想去越南吗？　　-是的
- You really think about Vietnam? - Yeah.

252
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,334
我不知道，我猜我是在想猎鹿的事
I don't know. I guess.

253
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:34,042
I'm thinking about the deer. Going to Nam.

254
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:34,209
就想到越南去

255
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:37,209
我喜欢树木，你知道吗？
I like the trees, you know?

256
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,042
我喜欢山上树木的样子，全都不同
I like the way the trees are in the mountains, all the different...

257
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,042
树木的样子
The way the trees are.

258
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,209
我听起来像傻的，对吗？
I sound like some asshole, right?

259
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,042
我告诉你，尼克
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy I go hunting with, you know?

260
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,960
我只愿意和你一个人去打猎

261
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:59,002
我喜欢行动敏捷的人
I like a guy with quick moves and speed. I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

262
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,792
我才不要和傻瓜一起打猎
- Well, who's an asshole? - Who's an asshole?

263
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:04,167
谁是傻瓜？　　-你觉得谁是傻瓜？

264
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,542
Who do you think's an asshole?

265
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,501
他们全都是一群傻瓜
They're all a bunch of assholes.

266
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,208
我是说，我喜欢他们，他们都是好人
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys, but, you know, without you, I'd hunt alone.

267
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,251
但是，你知道

268
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,083
如果你不在，我宁愿自己一个人去打猎
- Seriously, that's what I'd do. - Well, you're a fucking nut.

269
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:13,585
说真的，我一定会那样做

270
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:15,668
你真是他妈的疯子
You know what, Mike? You're a maniac. Control freak.

271
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,834
你知道吗，麦可？你是偏执狂

272
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,334
你有控制狂

273
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,627
我只是不喜欢惊喜
I just don't like no surprises.

274
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,627
该死的东西打不开　　-好吧，踢它一下！
- Damn thing won't open. - Well, give it a kick.

275
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,542
嘿，嘿，不是这样，不是这样
Hey, hey, not like that. Not like that. Not... Here, here, here.

276
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:31,752
这里，这里，这里

277
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,416
看到了吗？
- See that? - Fuckin' A.

278
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:35,877
他妈的对极了

279
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,126
假仙
Unreal.

280
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,959
艾索，现在我知道
Axel, now I know why you're not still kicking for the Steelers.

有些车只是待在那里

285
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,000
但你永远不知道这部车
I mean, you never know with a car like this where the hell it's gonna take you.

286

The tuxedo's been stuck a million times. Where'd you get this thing?

297
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,126

It's only...

这不过是…
It's only... It's only a wedding, Stanley.

464

这不过是一场婚礼，史丹

465
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:45,751
什么叫做不过是一场婚礼？
What do you mean, "It's only a wedding"? The guy...

466
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:48,377
你看，他又摸了，他刚刚又摸了
Look, he did it again! He just did it!

你打伤我这里
You punched me right there. It hurts.

473
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,792
Is that better?

474
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:14,335
我要揍扁他
I'm gonna kick on his fucking ass.

475
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,460
史丹疯了
- Hey, Stan is crazy. - Why? What happened?

476
00:42:17,543 --> 00:42:20,042
为什么？发生什么事了？　　-史丹疯了

We're going airborne, sir. What's it like?

491
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:06,083
我希望他们送我们去枪林弹雨的战场
I hope they send us where the bullets are flying.

492
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,334
没错　　-战况最惨烈的地方
- Fighting's the worst, huh? - That's right.

操它的　　-我想他是这样说的
Fuck it. That's what I thought.

497

那里究竟怎么样？
Well, what's it like over there?

他到底是什么人？
- Who the hell is he? - Who the fuck knows?

507
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:53,209
我怎么会知道？
He looks like a fucking hillbilly.

508
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,042

我不知道我在说些什么
I don't know what the hell I mean.

533

你说的是你心里想的话

这是我最后一个真正的秘密
That's my last one true secret.

549

孩子生下来以后，我要怎么办？
What am I gonna do when she has a baby?

555
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:14,917
那是安琪拉的事
That's Angela's part, right? Leave all that to Angela.

556
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,459
让她自己处理，你只要放轻松　　-对

你不知道安琪拉的事？
You didn't know that about Angela, huh?

565
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:37,459
对吗？　　-那是胡扯
- Right? - Oh, that's bullshit.

胡扯？　　-胡扯

等等！拜托！
Wait! Come on! Oh, fuck!

This is not it. Definitely. This is not it.

660
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,751
它们变了　　-不是开玩笑的
- They changed it. Somehow they changed it. - No kidding.

661
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:06,293
不知怎的，它们变了

662
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,084
每年都是这个样子
- Like this happens every goddamn year. - You're full of shit, Stanley.

663
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,125
你真是满嘴胡说八道，史丹

664
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:12,709
你说谁满嘴胡说八道？
- Who did you say was full of shit? - You're full of shit.

665

00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:18,751
吃屎啦

668
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:20,875
尼克，我问你一个问题
Nick, how come I never see you eating?

669
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:22,166
为什么我从没见过你吃东西？
I like to starve myself. Keeps the fear up.

670
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,752
我喜欢挨饿，这样才能保持恐惧

671
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,752
这样很不自然
It ain't natural. Come on, John.

672
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:28,042
来吧，约翰
Hey! Hey, that's mine.

那是芥末　　-什么？
- That's mustard! - What?

679
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:50,042
他把芥末沾在蛋糕上
He put mustard on his Twink...

680
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:53,460
你说话的样子好像该死的交通警察
You're talking like a goddamn traffic cop.

真不敢相信
- Incredible. - Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

快点，给我一罐啤酒，麦可，快点啦
- Come on. Come on. - I can't believe you guys.

683
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,000
我真不敢相信你们这些家伙

684
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:02,335
我干嘛跟你们在一起？　　-不是这里
- What the hell am I doing with you? - This is not it.

685
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:04,959
它们变了，不知怎的，它们变了
They changed it. Somehow they changed it.

686
00:58:06,585 --> 00:58:08,459
你连自己的屁股在哪里都找不到
You couldn't find your own ass with two hands.

687
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,626
他妈的对极了
Fuckin' A.

688
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:10,627
你们知道吗？
Hey, you know, we forgot to toast Steven and Angela.

689

691
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:20,834
（俄语）

692
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,083
怎么了？
What?

693
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:30,501
我嘴巴里有东西的时候，别逗我笑
Don't make me laugh when I have things in my mouth.

694
00:58:30,502 --> 00:58:32,585
我再也受不了你们了
I can't take you guys anyplace. What the hell are you doing?

695
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:33,377
你到底在干什么？
Get your hands off the fucking bread.

696
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:35,252
你的手离面包远一点

697
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:37,417
猴子穿上西装还是猴子
You can dress 'em up, but you can't take 'em anywhere.

你知道吗？艾索
You know, Axel, you got a really terrific vocabulary.

705

It's getting cold, huh?

710
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:11,959
麦可，你有多的保暖袜吗？
Hey, Mike, you got any extra thermal socks?

711
00:59:15,168 --> 00:59:16,627
他妈的对极了！
Here we go.

712
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,460
麦可！
Hey, Mike, you got any extra thermal socks?

713
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:21,751
你有多的保暖袜吗？

714
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,917
不用了，我找到了
Never mind. I got 'em.

715
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:28,377
我该死的靴子跑哪去了？
Where the hell's my boots?

716
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:33,252
有谁看到我的靴子？
Anybody see my boots?

717
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:35,709
有人拿了我的靴子
Somebody took my boots.

718
00:59:36,293 --> 00:59:37,834
我特地买的
I bought 'em special.

719
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,042
没关系
All right. All right, you guys. Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

720
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:42,125
没关系，老兄，不管是谁拿的

721
00:59:42,126 --> 00:59:44,625
现在还我　　-我给你一双靴子，史丹
I got a boot for you, Stan, right up your ass.

722
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,210
在你屁股上

723
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,833
麦可
Hey, Mike.

724
00:59:52,252 --> 00:59:54,041
麦可，你备用的那双借我好吗？
Hey, Mike, let me borrow your spares, huh?

725
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:55,167
你多的那双？
- Your extra pair? - No, Stan.

726
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:56,460
不行，史丹

727
00:59:57,792 --> 00:59:58,791
不行？
No?

728
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,293
你说不行是什么意思？
- What do you mean, "no"? - Just what I said. No. No means no.

729
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:04,667
正如我说的，不行就是不行

730
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:07,916
真他妈的不够朋友
Some fucking friend. You're some fucking friend, you know that?

731
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:09,501
你真他妈的不够朋友，你知道吗？

732
01:00:09,502 --> 01:00:11,292
你得受点教训，史丹，每次你上来这里
You gotta learn. Every time you come here, you got your head up your ass.

733
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:13,000
你都只带屁股，没带脑袋

734
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:14,959
或许他喜欢用屁股欣赏风景吧？
Maybe he likes the view from up there.

735
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,417
每次他上来，他都没带刀
Every time he comes up, he's got no knife, he's got no jacket,

736
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:25,958
没有夹克，没有裤子，没有靴子
he's got no pants, he's got no boots.

737
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:29,335
他只有带着那把笨枪，像约翰韦恩一样
All he's got is that stupid gun he carries around like John Wayne.

738
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,085
那可帮不了你
That ain't gonna help you.

739
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,168
别搞了，麦可，把靴子借给他吧
Oh, what the hell, Mike. Give him the boots.

740
01:00:34,418 --> 01:00:35,958
门都没有，我绝不会把靴子借给他
No way, I ain't giving him no boots. No more. No more. That's it.

741
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:37,959
不借，不借，就是这样

742
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:41,001
你真是他妈的王八蛋，你知道吗？
You're a fucking bastard, you know that? Huh?

743
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:43,501
史丹，看到这个吗？
Stanley, see this? This is this.

744
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:45,666
这个就是这个，不是别的
This ain't something else. This is this.

745
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:47,377
这个就是这个

746
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,543
从现在开始，你要靠你自己了
From now on, you're on your own.

747
01:00:54,293 --> 01:00:56,292
我帮了你多少次
I fixed you up a million times.

748
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:58,502
我帮了他不知道多少次
I fixed him up a million times.

749
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:00,042
我不知道我帮他解决多少次
I don't know how many times I must've fixed him up with girls.

750
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:01,626
女孩子的事

751
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:04,085
但从来没有结果，一个也没有
And nothing ever happened. Zero.

752
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:05,666
你知道你的问题吗，麦可？
You know your trouble, Mike, huh?

753
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:08,084
没有人知道你他妈的在说些什么东西
Nobody ever knows what you're talking about.

754
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:09,168
“这个就是这个”
"This is this."

755
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,584
什么叫做“这个就是这个”？
What the hell's that supposed to mean? "This is this."

756
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,459
我是说那听起来像同性恋在放屁
Is that faggot-sounding bullshit, or is that faggot-sounding...

757
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,501
还是什么的…
Shut up, Stan, will you?

758
01:01:14,502 --> 01:01:16,252
闭嘴，史丹，好吗？

759
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:18,042
老兄，你太超过了
Hey, man, you're outta line.

760
01:01:18,043 --> 01:01:19,251
小心那把枪，史丹
- Watch out with that gun, Stan. - Do you know what I think?

761
01:01:19,252 --> 01:01:21,252
你知道我怎么想的？　　-小心了

762
01:01:21,335 --> 01:01:22,210
你知道我怎么想的？
You know what I think?

763
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,750
我发誓我有几次想过你是同性恋
There's times I swear I think you're a fucking faggot.

764
01:01:24,751 --> 01:01:26,541
别这样，你们这些家伙
Hey, come on, you guys.

765
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:28,417
上星期，就是上星期，他本来可以搞上
Last week he could've had that new redheaded waitress at the Bowladrome.

766
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,126
酒吧新来的红发女服务生

767
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:31,791
只要他点头，他就可以上了她
He could've had it knocked, and look what he did.

768
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,667
可是他做了什么？他什么也没做
Nothing! That's what.

769
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:35,127
就是那样
Shut up, Stan, huh? Just shut up!

770
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:37,626
闭嘴，史丹！只要闭嘴

771
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:41,126
只要闭嘴，把麦可该死的靴子拿去
Just shut up. Take... Take Michael's goddamn boots and shut up.

772
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:42,210
然后闭嘴
Otherwise, I'm going home.

773
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:44,167
要不然我要回家了
Yeah, I'm going home right now.

774
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:45,876
好，我现在就回家

775
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:47,625
别碰我的东西
Get off my stuff. What the hell are you doing?

776
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:48,959
你在里面搞什么啊？

777
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:53,210
嘿，史丹
Hey, Stosh.

778
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:56,127
我说过不借了
I said "no".

779
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:02,959
你要怎么样？杀了我？
What, are you gonna shoot me?

780
01:02:03,626 --> 01:02:05,167
Huh?

781
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,209
这里
Here.

782
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:28,418
你到底怎么一回事？
What's the matter with you?

783
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:31,791
史丹
Stan.

784
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,292
小心，麦可！小心
Watch it, Mike! Pow! Whack!

785
01:05:50,043 --> 01:05:51,793
史帝夫！

786
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:56,542
安琪拉，我有一把大枪！
Hey! Hey, Angela, I got a big eye!

787
01:05:56,667 --> 01:06:00,708
（俄语）

788
01:06:00,709 --> 01:06:03,168
回家！快滚回家！
Bums! Go home! Go home!

789
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:08,334
（威尔许酒吧）

790
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:18,167
<i>主啊，把我踢进</i>

天啊，我真不敢相信
Holy Christ. I don't believe it.

放轻松，会没事的
It's gonna be OK.

It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.

好了，好了
Come on. Come on. Come on.

831

我没事
I'm OK.

没有事的，没事
Easy. That's all right. OK. OK.

Shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it out.

839
01:16:23,168 --> 01:16:27,543
想想别的事，想想你家里

Think of home. Think of home.

01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:30,917
想着安琪拉

842
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:16,085
他们会杀了我，麦可
- Come on. - They're gonna have to kill my ass, Mike.

843
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:20,833
史帝夫，你要照做，如果你不做
Stevie, you gotta do it.

844
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,626
他们就会把你扔进坑里
You don't do it, they're gonna throw you in a pit.

845
01:17:23,502 --> 01:17:25,209
他们把你扔进坑里，你就死定了
They throw you in a pit, you're gonna die.

846
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:28,042
做吧，你必须做，你做得到的
Go ahead. You gotta do it. You can do it.

847
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:31,127
你做得到的，史帝夫
You can do it, Stevie. You can do it.

848
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:39,625
看我的眼睛，史帝夫
Look in my eyes.

849
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:40,709
史帝夫，看着我！

You showed these bastards. Showed 'em.

你给他们点颜色了

867

别担心，孩子
Don't worry, kid.

尼克

尼克，听着
Nicky, listen.

884
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:29,252
现在要靠我们，只有我和你
It's up to us now.

885
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:29,959
It's me and you.

886
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:31,377
史帝夫呢？
- What about Steven? - Forget him.

887
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:33,127
不管他了

888
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:36,293
不管他？　　-不管他了，他撑不下去的
- Forget him? - Forget him. He ain't gonna make it.

889
01:20:37,293 --> 01:20:39,127
你以为你是谁？上帝？
Who do you think you are? God?

890
01:20:42,168 --> 01:20:44,127
看看他，他已经神智不清
Look at him. He's in a daze.

891
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:47,584
他无法醒来了，他活在梦中
He ain't coming out. He's in a dream.

892
01:20:47,834 --> 01:20:48,876
麦可，你在说什么？
- Mike, what are you saying? - I'm saying forget him, Nick.

893
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,751
我说别管他了，尼克

894
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:53,376
脑袋清醒一点，不然你和我也会死
Get it through your head, or you and me are both gone, too.

895
01:21:02,877 --> 01:21:04,501
玩更多子弹
We gotta play with more bullets.

896
01:21:04,877 --> 01:21:06,501
什么？　　-更多子弹

897

我要在枪里面装更多子弹

898

01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,458
枪里面装更多子弹？　　-更多子弹
- More bullets in the gun? - More bullets in the gun.

900
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:18,960
要多装几颗？
How many more bullets?

901
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,626
三颗
Three.

902
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:32,751
那表示我们必须对赌
That means we gotta play each other.

903
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:36,001
装更多子弹，然后对赌？你疯了吗？
More bullets against each oth... What? Are you crazy?

904
01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:37,626
尼克，这是唯一的方法
Nicky, it's the only way.

905
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:43,085
我会挑选时机
I'll pick the moment. The game goes until I move.

906
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:45,084
游戏持续进行直到我采取行动

907
01:21:45,085 --> 01:21:47,666
当我开始射击时，你就对付最近的守卫
When I start shooting, you go for the nearest guard.

908
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:49,792
你拿到他的枪，然后干掉那个王八蛋
You get his gun and zap the fucker.

909
01:21:49,877 --> 01:21:51,334
我还没准备好
- I'm not ready for this. - You gotta listen to me.

910
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:53,042
你必须听我的
You wanna stay down here and die?

911
01:21:53,043 --> 01:21:54,877
你想留在这下面等死吗？

912
01:21:56,626 --> 01:21:57,625
去吧
Go on. It's up to you.

913
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:00,541
由你决定，就是现在，由你决定

914
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:01,667
不！
- Now it's up to you. - No!

915

01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:54,085
别担心，尼克，别担心
Don't worry. Five minutes, we're gonna be outta here.

933
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:57,085
再五分钟，我们就要离开这里了

934
01:23:57,334 --> 01:23:58,877
我们一定会离开这里
We're gonna be outta here.

你和我，你和我
You and me. You and me.

Now we got ourselves a real game.

好的，没事
OK. All right.

1018
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,626
就是这样
That's it.

1019
01:33:54,168 --> 01:33:55,293
我的手
- That's it. - My arm. My arm.

1020

好的
I can't... I can't feel my legs.

01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:07,876
? So he's leaving the life

1081
01:43:07,959 --> 01:43:10,709

1082
01:43:10,792 --> 01:43:12,667

? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

1100
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:11,542
? I'd rather live in his world

1101
01:44:11,626 --> 01:44:13,334
? Than live without him in mine

1102
01:44:18,084 --> 01:44:20,417

我要去买一只大象
I gotta get an elephant.

1115
01:45:02,376 --> 01:45:06,208
不！我不能待在小孩子哭闹的房间

1116
01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:06,209
I can't stay here in a room with a kid crying.

01:45:06,209 --> 01:45:08,418
过来这里　　-不，不要

你为什么不先付钱给我？去你的！
Why don't you pay me first?

1119
01:45:10,459 --> 01:45:12,584
Fuck you!

1120
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:16,334
Oh.

1121
01:45:17,834 --> 01:45:19,334
Oh.

1122
01:45:23,584 --> 01:45:25,417
? The snow does snow

1123
01:45:25,501 --> 01:45:28,209
? The rain does rain

1124
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,834
? The wind does blow

1125
01:45:32,417 --> 01:45:35,084
? The rain does rain

1126
01:45:35,167 --> 01:45:37,792
? The snow does snow

1127
01:45:37,876 --> 01:45:39,834
? The wind does blow ?

1128
01:46:31,917 --> 01:46:33,627
你看起来很困扰
You seem disturbed.

1129
01:46:49,377 --> 01:46:51,251
里面的人是为了钱做这种事吗？
People inside doing it for money?

1130
01:46:52,126 --> 01:46:54,209
有时候是很大的一笔钱
Sometime a great deal of money.

1131
01:46:55,084 --> 01:46:57,208
我自己没办法玩这种游戏
I cannot play this kind of game myself.

1132
01:46:57,209 --> 01:47:00,585
但我一向…你们是怎么说的？
But I'm always... How do you say?

1133
01:47:01,084 --> 01:47:04,792
追求不同的事物
Looking out for those things quite different, quite rare.

1134
01:47:05,209 --> 01:47:06,668
非常稀有的

1135
01:47:09,209 --> 01:47:10,668
要香槟吗？
Champagne, perhaps?

1136
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:12,709
不
No.

1137
01:47:13,876 --> 01:47:15,167
别说不
Don't say no.

1138
01:47:16,209 --> 01:47:18,000
当一个男人对香槟说不
When a man say no to champagne, he say no to life.

1139
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:19,668
他就等于是对生命说不

1140
01:47:24,959 --> 01:47:26,460
你以前看过吗？
You saw this before?

1141
01:47:30,585 --> 01:47:31,752
在北部
Up north.

1142
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:34,042
是的，当然
Oh, yes. Of course.

1143
01:47:34,627 --> 01:47:35,751
我得走了
Gotta go.

1144
01:47:36,252 --> 01:47:38,252
但你一定要进来
But you must come in.

1145
01:47:40,126 --> 01:47:41,335
我坚持
I insist.

1146
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:47,377
在这场战争之后，还有什么好怕的？
Of what is there to be afraid of after this war?

1147
01:47:47,585 --> 01:47:49,126
这场战争是个笑话
War is a joke.

1148
01:47:49,418 --> 01:47:50,293
是件蠢事
- A silly thing. - I'm going home, ace!

1149
01:47:50,294 --> 01:47:51,834
我要回家了，赌王

1150
01:47:52,585 --> 01:47:55,876
基本上，我付钱给我的玩家，现金
<i>Naturellement</i> I pay my players...

1151
01:47:56,252 --> 01:47:57,460
美金
cash, American.

1152
01:47:58,126 --> 01:48:00,833
或者你比较喜欢德国马克
However, should you prefer German marks or perhaps Swiss franc,

1153
01:48:00,834 --> 01:48:05,252
或是瑞士法郎，当然那都没问题

1154
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:05,167
that, of course, can be arranged.

1155
01:48:05,335 --> 01:48:06,875
我任何事情都能搞定
- I can arrange everything. - You got the wrong guy, ace.

1156
01:48:06,876 --> 01:48:08,252
你找错人了，赌王
- But you must come in. - Don't do that.

1157
01:48:08,377 --> 01:48:10,502
但你一定要进来　　-不，别那样

1158
01:48:10,543 --> 01:48:12,377
不过，我坚持
But I insist.

1159
01:48:45,627 --> 01:48:48,627
（越南话）

1160
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:33,041
尼克！
Nick!

1161
01:49:55,418 --> 01:49:56,417
尼克！
Hey, Nick!

1162
01:50:20,584 --> 01:50:23,459
Hey! Nick! Nick!

1163
01:50:22,834 --> 01:50:23,833
尼克！

1164
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:28,625
听着，如果你既勇敢再加上好运
- Listen, if you are very brave and lucky... - Hey, Nick!

1165
01:50:28,626 --> 01:50:31,584
尼克！　　-我可以让你非常有钱
...I can make you very, very rich.

1166
01:51:09,085 --> 01:51:10,834
你看到那个了吗？
Wow, would you look at that?

1167
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:15,625
（欢迎麦可回家） 继续走，继续走
- Just keep going. Just keep going. - You said Logan Street.

1168
01:51:15,626 --> 01:51:17,167
你说要到罗根街的，老兄
- The trailer. It's right there. - Just keep going.

1169
01:51:17,168 --> 01:51:19,084
拖车就在那里　　-我只想继续往前走

1170
01:51:19,085 --> 01:51:20,876
一直等到麦可回来这里，好吗？
Just wait till Michael gets here, huh?

1171
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:24,876
就是他了，麦可来了
This is it! This is Michael!

1172
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:29,833
好了，大家留在原地
All right. Everybody, stay where you are! Stay right there. I'll go get him.

1173
01:51:29,834 --> 01:51:32,042
我去接他，大家留在这里
Everybody, stay here.

1174
01:51:32,043 --> 01:51:34,209
为红白蓝欢呼三声！
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.

1175
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:36,210
加油！加油！加加油！
Hip, hip, hurray!

1176
01:51:36,542 --> 01:51:38,751
加油！加油！加加油！
Hip, hip, hurray!

1177
01:51:40,043 --> 01:51:41,335
加油！
Hip, hip, hurray!

1178
01:51:48,751 --> 01:51:50,334
那辆计程车没有停下来
- That cab ain't stopping. - What's going on?

1179
01:51:50,335 --> 01:51:51,334
这是怎么回事？

1180
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,792
我等不及让他看到这一切
I can't wait for him to see all this stuff.

1181
01:51:59,542 --> 01:52:00,542
怎么了？
What happened?

1182
01:52:00,876 --> 01:52:02,959
史丹，怎么回事？我还以为是他
Hey, Stosh, what happened? I thought it was him.

1183
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:05,293
可能是他的飞机误点
So his plane could be late.

1184
01:52:05,626 --> 01:52:06,750
放轻松点好吗，艾索？
Take it easy, will you, Axel? You're driving everyone nuts.

1185
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:08,834
你把所有人都逼疯了

1186
01:52:11,959 --> 01:52:13,127
你还好吧？
You OK?

1187
01:52:21,626 --> 01:52:23,501
我知道尼克很快就会回来的
I know Nick will be back soon.

1188
01:52:24,709 --> 01:52:26,876
我了解尼克，他也会回来的
I know Nick. He'll be coming back, too.

1189
01:52:29,043 --> 01:52:30,917
对不对，艾索？　　-真他妈对极了
- Right, Axel? - Fuckin' A.

1190
01:52:32,917 --> 01:52:34,334
往前走一直到高速公路
- Go straight on down to the highway. - It's your bread, man.

1191
01:52:34,335 --> 01:52:35,960
付钱的是你，老兄

1192
01:52:45,792 --> 01:52:50,127
（河景汽车旅馆）

1193
01:55:18,168 --> 01:55:19,667
等一下！

1194
01:56:19,251 --> 01:56:20,835
门没锁
It's open!

1195
01:56:36,793 --> 01:56:37,792
是…
I'm sor... Michael?

1196
01:56:38,542 --> 01:56:39,667
麦可！

1197
01:56:41,002 --> 01:56:43,501
喔，麦可！
Oh, Michael!

1198
01:56:44,334 --> 01:56:47,292
喔，麦可！
Oh!

1199
01:56:45,626 --> 01:56:48,876
Oh, Michael! Oh, Michael!

1200
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,127
喔，麦可！

1201
01:56:50,002 --> 01:56:51,376
喔，麦可！
Oh, my God.

1202
01:56:53,417 --> 01:56:55,251
喔，我的天！
Oh, gee.

1203
01:56:55,752 --> 01:56:57,417
你看起来好漂亮
Gee, you look beautiful.

1204
01:56:58,959 --> 01:57:02,709
Oh, uh... let me take your coat.

1205
01:57:00,793 --> 01:57:02,417
我帮你拿大衣

1206
01:57:02,792 --> 01:57:06,542
Oh! Everybody was here. You missed them all.

1207
01:57:04,584 --> 01:57:06,626
大家本来都在这里，你错过他们了

1208
01:57:06,667 --> 01:57:08,084
Oh.

1209
01:57:09,127 --> 01:57:10,250
如果他们发现错过你
They're gonna be so mad when they find out they missed you.

1210
01:57:10,251 --> 01:57:12,417
他们一定会气死的

1211
01:57:16,085 --> 01:57:17,334
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1212
01:57:24,877 --> 01:57:26,877
你知道，我希望…
You know, I was hoping...

1213
01:57:27,668 --> 01:57:30,500
麦可，我本来希望有可能
I was hoping somehow, Michael, maybe you had... Nick with you.

1214
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:31,710
尼克会和你一起回来

1215
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:33,250
没有
No.

1216
01:57:34,793 --> 01:57:35,792
没有
No.

1217
01:57:44,209 --> 01:57:45,835
你有尼克的任何消息吗？
You hear anything on Nick?

1218
01:57:48,877 --> 01:57:49,877
没有
No.

1219
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,166
一点都没有
Nothing. He's A.W.O.L.

1220
01:57:54,167 --> 01:57:56,626
我们只知道他无假外出而己
That's all we know.

1221
01:58:00,542 --> 01:58:01,793
他会回来的
He'll be back.

1222
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,835
他从没写信给我，也从没打过电话
He never wrote to me. He never called me.

1223
01:58:06,417 --> 01:58:07,918
也许你刚好不在
Maybe you were out.

1224
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,209
也许吧
Yeah. Maybe.

1225
01:58:17,501 --> 01:58:19,627
总之，你好吗？
So how are you anyway?

1226
01:58:20,251 --> 01:58:22,501
我很好，很好，你呢？
I'm fine. OK. How are you?

1227
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:26,291
我？我很好，我没事
Er... me?

1228
01:58:26,292 --> 01:58:27,793
还过得去，你知道
I'm OK. I'm fine. I go along, you know?

1229
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,125
还是在超市上班
Still working at the market there.

1230
01:58:30,126 --> 01:58:33,334
那里有许多事情要做

1231
01:58:31,751 --> 01:58:33,626
There's a million things to do.

1232
01:58:34,918 --> 01:58:36,751
你确定你没事吗？
- You sure you're all right, huh? - Yeah, I'm all right.

1233
01:58:36,752 --> 01:58:39,251
是，我很好　　-你的伤势如何？
- What about your wounds? - It was nothing, just...

1234
01:58:39,835 --> 01:58:41,334
没什么

1235
01:58:42,376 --> 01:58:44,500
只是普通的并发症而己
- Just the usual complications, that's all. - We heard.

1236
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:45,334
我们听说…
No, that's not true, a lot of guys go through it.

1237
01:58:45,335 --> 01:58:47,542
不，那不是真的，很多人都经历过

1238
01:58:48,876 --> 01:58:50,834
Hmm.

1239
01:58:52,918 --> 01:58:55,002
我替尼克织了那件毛衣
I made Nick that sweater.

1240
01:59:02,417 --> 01:59:04,877
我记不起正确的尺寸
I couldn't remember the exact size, but...

1241
01:59:05,793 --> 01:59:08,376
但我想他的尺寸和你差不多，对吗
I think he's about the same size as you, huh?

1242
01:59:12,043 --> 01:59:15,126
不，太大了，真糟
No.

1243
01:59:13,626 --> 01:59:15,959
Too big. Whoops.

1244
01:59:16,752 --> 01:59:18,960
不过我可以修改
Well, I could fix that, though. I mean...

1245
01:59:20,167 --> 01:59:22,835
我是说毛线很容易…
One thing about wool, it's really a cinch...

1246
01:59:26,126 --> 01:59:27,585
修改
...to fix.

1247
01:59:29,084 --> 01:59:30,877
喔，天啊！
Oh, Christ.

1248
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,710
没事的
It's OK.

1249
01:59:35,417 --> 01:59:36,793
没事的

1250
01:59:41,543 --> 01:59:42,835
没事的
It's OK.

1251
01:59:44,585 --> 01:59:45,627
你的工作如何？
- How's your job? - Great. Fine. Yeah.

1252
01:59:45,710 --> 01:59:48,084
好极了，很好

1253
01:59:49,084 --> 01:59:51,041
有一两次我们差点要关门了
Once or twice we almost had to close. I gotta go to work now.

1254
01:59:51,042 --> 01:59:52,710
我现在要去上班了

1255
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,585
你现在就要去？　　-对
- Gotta go now? - Yeah.

1256
01:59:57,002 --> 01:59:59,292
你介意我陪你走过去吗？
Uh, would you mind if I walked you to work?

1257
02:00:03,543 --> 02:00:05,167
麦可，你真…
Mikie, you're so... weird.

1258
02:00:06,543 --> 02:00:07,793
奇怪

1259
02:00:08,543 --> 02:00:10,459
你总是很有绅士风度
You're always such a gentleman.

1260
02:00:12,334 --> 02:00:14,126
Well...

1261
02:00:19,585 --> 02:00:21,208
外面很冷　　-对
- It's cold out there. - Yeah.

1262
02:00:21,209 --> 02:00:22,585
我还不太习惯
I'm not used to it.

1263
02:00:24,251 --> 02:00:27,042
我真高与你活着
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

1264
02:00:27,835 --> 02:00:29,752
我真的很高兴
I'm so happy.

1265
02:00:32,209 --> 02:00:34,292
我真的不知道我的感觉
I really don't know what I feel.

1266
02:00:53,042 --> 02:00:54,084
你好啊

1267
02:01:04,793 --> 02:01:06,042
你好啊，麦可
- Hey, Jack. - Hello. How are you?

1268
02:01:27,918 --> 02:01:32,835
琳达，我只想说，尼克的事，我很抱歉
Linda, er... I just want to say how sorry I am about Nick.

1269
02:01:33,376 --> 02:01:35,126
而且…
And how... I know how much you loved him, and...

1270
02:01:35,543 --> 02:01:37,752
我知道你很爱他

1271
02:01:37,959 --> 02:01:39,959
而且永远没有人可以替代
I know that it'll never be the same.

1272
02:01:41,835 --> 02:01:43,585
我只想告诉你这些
I just wanted to tell you that.

1273
02:01:45,042 --> 02:01:48,668
也许…我不知道，也许你不想谈
Maybe... I don't know, maybe you don't want to talk about it.

1274
02:01:56,917 --> 02:02:01,126
（老鹰超市）

1275
02:02:05,126 --> 02:02:06,917
你好吗，美女？
How's it going, hot lips?

1276
02:02:09,001 --> 02:02:12,585
他是新来的，很烦人
Yeah, a new kid.

1277
02:02:11,334 --> 02:02:13,126
A real tough guy.

1278
02:02:14,334 --> 02:02:15,460
没关系
It's OK.

1279
02:02:17,667 --> 02:02:19,626
Mike.

1280
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:22,876
你何不跟我进去？
Why don't you come in with me?

1281
02:02:22,917 --> 02:02:25,584
只是打声招呼，来吧，麦可，拜托
Just say hello. Go on, just for... Oh, Mike, please.

1282
02:02:25,585 --> 02:02:27,793
只是打声招呼，他们都想见你，我知道
Just say hello. They want to see you, I know.

1283
02:02:28,167 --> 02:02:30,167
只要一下子，好吗？
Just for a second, OK? OK.

1284
02:02:30,377 --> 02:02:31,752
嘿，看谁来了？
Hey, look who's here. It's Michael.

1285
02:02:32,001 --> 02:02:33,000
麦可来了！
- Look who's here. Hey, everybody. - Oh, Michael!

1286
02:02:33,001 --> 02:02:34,917
大家看看谁来了

1287
02:02:35,543 --> 02:02:36,292
麦可
- Oh, Michael, I read about you in the paper. - Helen!

1288
02:02:36,293 --> 02:02:40,166
喔！麦可

1289
02:02:40,167 --> 02:02:42,126
喔！麦可，亲爱的
- Let me... - Oh, Michael. Oh, dear.

1290
02:02:43,126 --> 02:02:44,459
他看起来很棒吧？
- Doesn't he look terrific, Janie? - Hi, Michael.

1291
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:45,917
你的大衣真不错

1292

不了，谢谢
- ? It happens every time we get together - No, thanks.

1442
02:13:35,543 --> 02:13:41,209

<i>我们真的互相道别了吗？</i>
? Did we ever really say goodbye?

Yeah, Linda!

1450
02:14:07,167 --> 02:14:08,918
你觉得她怎么样，麦可？
What do you think of her, Mike?

1451
02:14:09,459 --> 02:14:10,626
我不知道
- I don't know. - No, come on. On the level. On the level.

1452
02:14:10,668 --> 02:14:12,960
不知道？来吧，直说吧

1453
02:14:13,167 --> 02:14:14,793
我不知道，史丹
I don't know, Stosh.

1454

她漂亮吗？
Is she... Is she beautiful?

她漂亮吗？漂亮吗？
Is she beautiful? Is she?

1456

? Tattletale eyes, told on our minds... ?

1465
02:14:46,542 --> 02:14:48,752
我也不觉得她聪明
I don't think she's intelligent either.

1466
02:14:49,167 --> 02:14:50,250
那你为什么还看上她？
- What the hell you see in her? - I don't know, that's what I came to ask you.

1467
02:14:50,251 --> 02:14:52,626
我也不知道，所以…

1468
02:14:52,627 --> 02:14:55,376
我才过来问你…也许她的床上功夫很好
Maybe she's good in bed.

1469
02:14:56,334 --> 02:14:57,710
你为什么不去问她？
Why don't you ask her?

1470
02:14:57,752 --> 02:15:01,458
<i>告密者的眼睛</i>

我那该死的球跑到哪里去了？
Now, where the fuck is my fucking ball?

1477
02:15:26,126 --> 02:15:28,251
该死的捡球机
- Goddamn pinsetter! - ? Tattletale eyes

1478

他要去哪里？　　-他在干什么？
Where's he going?

1479

麦可！
Michael!

1482
02:15:45,626 --> 02:15:47,251
What the hell happened?

1483
02:15:47,376 --> 02:15:48,417
怎么回事？
- What the hell happened? - The pinsetter came down.

1484
02:15:48,668 --> 02:15:50,333
捡球机压到他

1485
02:15:50,334 --> 02:15:52,376

这该死的地方什么都坏了
Shit. Nothing works around this damn place anymore.

1487

来吧，艾索
We're getting you clear here.

好了，你们现在想做什么？
What do you guys want to do now, huh?

1494
02:16:16,918 --> 02:16:18,376
我们要去打猎，对吧？
- We're going hunting, right? - Who asked you?

1495
02:16:18,585 --> 02:16:20,208
谁问你了？他妈的是谁问你了？

- But no women. - Just like old times, hey, am I right?

1499
02:16:26,877 --> 02:16:28,917
就像以前一样，麦可，对吗？

1500
02:16:28,918 --> 02:16:31,083
我说的对不对？就像以前一样

你是在开我玩笑吧，艾索？
Are you kidding me, Axel?

1503
02:18:08,917 --> 02:18:11,334
如果我在你的位置
Forty times we could've had it!

1504

我们早就打中它一百次了
If I'd have been where you are.

1505

干掉它，艾索！

他妈的对极了！
Jesus Christ. What the hell is that?

1509
02:18:58,917 --> 02:19:00,876

那把愚蠢的枪在这里有什么用？
What's that stupid little gun doing up here?

1517

万一你撞见你的女友
In case you stumble on one of your girlfriends

1520
02:21:08,335 --> 02:21:10,585
她正在帮一个森林管理员吹喇叭？
