1
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:18,100
Down!

2
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:30,214
How ya doin'?

3
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:35,010
Hey, watch out, Axel. We'll be
calling him old fireballs after tonight.

4
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,346
- Fuckin' A.
- Not bad.

5
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,350
Hey, Stevie,
now that you're going to the army,

6
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,352
how about givin'
my 20 bucks back?

7
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,530
- So long, Mike.
- Take care, Mike.

8
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,490
I'll see ya, fellas.

9
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:59,410
- Freddy!
- Hi, Mike. Be good.

10
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:02,621
- You hear about the happy Roman?
- Yeah.

11
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,332
- He was "glad he ate her. "
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.

12
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,543
- Where's Stan? Hey, Stan!
- I don't know.

13
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:09,545
- I'll see you later.
- Take care.

14
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:11,589
Nick! Write us.

15
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,632
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Bye-bye.

16
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:16,010
- So long.
- Take it easy, Mike.

17
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,346
- Don't get your ass shot off, Okay? Good luck.
- Okay, I won't.

18
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:22,766
Hey! Say, Mike, take care of yourself.
Good luck to you.

19
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:26,145
- Kill a few for me too.
- I will. Stay out of trouble.

20
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:28,147
Hey, little killer.

21
00:05:28,188 --> 00:05:30,649
Stevie! Hey!

22
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:35,446
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Stanley!

23
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:38,157
- Stanley, you asshole.
- Hey, Stan!

24
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:41,619
Stan, it's no use!

25
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,954
Come on, Stosh.
You're beautiful now.

26
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,123
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan!

27
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,250
Good luck to you
in the army, man.

28
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,210
Get Stanley, Axel.

29
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:52,171
Come on. Come on.

30
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:56,258
Get the hell outta here.

31
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,261
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

32
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:04,642
Very mature. Very mature,
well-adapted individual, Stosh.

33
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:07,102
- Take it easy.
- Whoa.

34
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:10,856
Hey! Look at that! Whoa!
What the hell is that?

35
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:12,858
Where? Oh, yeah.

36
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:18,072
Holy shit. You know what that is?
Those are sun dogs.

37
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:19,114
What does it mean?

38
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:22,993
A blessing on the hunter sent by
the great wolf to his children.

39
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:26,872
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- It's an old Indian thing.

40
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:29,416
You're full of shit.

41
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,753
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

42
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,713
You know, Mike,

43
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:37,675
there's times when nobody but a doctor
can understand you.

44
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,635
That's an omen,
you know that?

45
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:43,013
We can have one great
fucking hunting trip tonight.

46
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:46,350
Mike, I don't know
where you come up with all this.

47
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:48,644
Hey, wait a minute.

48
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,981
What? Are you thinking of
going deer huntin' tonight?

49
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:55,234
Not tonight.
I'm gettin' married tonight.

50
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:57,653
- You fuckin' guys would go deer huntin'.
- Hey, hey.

51
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:00,072
First we get you legal.
Tuck you into bed with Angela.

52
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:02,032
Hey, baby.

53
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,076
You guys are fuckin' nuts.
You know that?

54
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,036
- Boy, you're all crazy.
- Life is over.

55
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:09,081
Yeah, right.
You're gettin' married. We're crazy.

56
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,959
It's all right.
Hey, it's all right.

57
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,588
We'll be right with you, all of us, won't we?
Right? Am I right?

58
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,048
- Right.
- Fuckin' A, man.

59
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,426
Come on. Come on, you guys.

60
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:23,262
- I'm buying the first round this morning.
- Hey, Steven!

61
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:26,682
Any help you might need tonight,
just feel free to call on me.

62
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:30,185
Hey, Stanley, sometimes
your sense of humor ain't funny.

63
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,688
- Come on, Steven.
- Willing fingers.

64
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,690
Extra lips.

65
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,650
Fuckin' A, man.

66
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:39,904
- Hey, you're a regular poet, Axel.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

67
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,906
- Get in the car.
- Come on. Come on.

68
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:49,079
I do.

69
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,083
I do.

70
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:57,588
I do.

71
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,810
Oh, my God.

72
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:26,408
I still do not
believe this.

73
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,370
My own boy
with a strange girl.

74
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:33,999
And not so thin, if you understand
my meaning. Not such a thin girl.

75
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:38,420
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

76
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,968
I do not understand, Father.

77
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:49,598
I understand
nothing anymore. Nothing!

78
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:57,982
Why?

79
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:02,820
Can you explain?
Can anyone explain?

80
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,725
- Pass him on the inside.
- Oh-oh, you'd never do it.

81
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,393
Shut up.

82
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:36,937
- It's your Caddy against my truck.
- Is today your lucky day?

83
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,939
You can't make it.

84
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:58,417
Hey, hey, Axel,
you owe him a window.

85
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,378
Mike! Mike!
Hey, mighty Mike!

86
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,464
- Oh, Axel.
- Here's your truck back.

87
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:05,758
Oh, hell, I hope
he didn't break an axle.

88
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,010
I wouldn't want
to take advantage of you.

89
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,220
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

90
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:12,431
- There's no such thing as a sure thing.
- Yeah.

91
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:14,391
Did you see that?

92
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:18,437
- Hey, Boom!
- Hey, how ya doin'?

93
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:21,106
Don't take anybody's money!

94
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:25,152
- Don't take my money. Take his money.
- Set 'em up.

95
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,114
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.
- Kessler and a Rolling Rock.

96
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:31,909
Give him a short one.

97
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,245
And give my friends down here
my warm regards.

98
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:36,747
- John!
- Aaah!

99
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:46,048
Hey, I got a hundred bucks says the Eagles
never cross the 50 in the next half.

100
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,509
And the Steelers win
by what? Twenty.

101
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,554
I got an extra 20 says
the Eagles' quarterback wears a dress!

102
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:57,935
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

103
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,335
- Oh, did I get all wet?
- No. I don't know.

104
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,848
Come on, Amy!

105
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,854
Come on!

106
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:48,068
Uh, Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

107
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,616
- Is that all right?
- Uh-

108
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:56,160
- Up a bit, I would say, wouldn't you say so?
- Up!

109
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:59,622
No, no, no, down.

110
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:02,541
Oh, what a beautiful cake. Here.

111
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:08,172
You've earned a drink.

112
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:13,886
You have a beautiful cake.

113
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:15,846
Hey!

114
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:18,057
I haven't forgotten about you.

115
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:20,059
I have one for you too.

116
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:49,755
Go to... fuckin' hell.

117
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:55,886
I'll give every car
in the town a flat tire.

118
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,973
- Every goddamn one.
- Oh, Daddy.

119
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,891
I'll do it!

120
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:06,772
Yeah, I fuckin' mean
what I say, girl.

121
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,732
Shh. Yes. Come on.

122
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:12,570
- All around... like a sea.
- Oh, my God.

123
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:15,364
Ocean of flat tires.

124
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,576
- Fuckin'... bitch.
- No!

125
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:21,704
All bitches.

126
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,166
- I hate 'em.
- Daddy.

127
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,795
- Daddy! Daddy, no, it's me!
- Fuckin' bitches!

128
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:33,799
Give 'em all flat tires.

129
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,876
"You're just too good
to be true"

130
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:13,505
That's great.
Now I'm gonna smoke your ass.

131
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:16,675
"Like heaven to touch"

132
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,762
"I wanna hold you so much"

133
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:24,892
"At long last
love has arrived"

134
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:27,353
"And I thank God I'm alive"

135
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:30,689
- "You're just too good to be true"
- It's my shot, right?

136
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,108
- "Can't take my eyes"
- Come on, John.

137
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,527
- "Off of you"
- Wipe off the tables.

138
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:39,490
This is it.
This is really it.

139
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,201
I mean,

140
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,828
here I go.

141
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:55,297
There's no sense
in gettin' too relaxed, buddy.

142
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,008
- "Let me know that it's real"
- Come on.

143
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,345
"You're just too good
to be true"

144
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:04,598
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

145
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:09,812
"Ba-da, da-da
Da-da, ba-ba-ba"

146
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:13,649
"Ba-da, ba-da
Ba-ba, da-da-da"

147
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:17,403
"Ba-da, da-da
Da-da, ba-ba-ba"

148
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:21,407
"Ba-da, ba-da, da"

149
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,577
"I love you, baby"

150
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,495
"And if it's quite
all right"

151
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:30,332
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely night"

152
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,793
"I love you, baby"

153
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:36,839
"Trust in me when I say"

154
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:39,883
"Oh, pretty baby"

155
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:43,345
"Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby"

156
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:45,306
"Now that I've found you
Stay"

157
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:51,228
"And let me love you, baby
Let me love you"

158
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,023
- You faggot.
- "You're just too good"

159
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:56,984
- "To be true"
- Bums!

160
00:15:57,026 --> 00:15:59,945
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

161
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:01,989
"You-"

162
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,991
Hey!

163
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:07,620
- "I wanna hold you so much"
- Jesus.

164
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,503
Jesus Christ!

165
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:20,090
To do this to your own mother...

166
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:23,594
who prays for you all her life.

167
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:26,096
Is your heart so cruel,
so unfeeling?

168
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:29,350
You marry this girl.
You leave her with me.

169
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:32,561
And you go with these bums
to the Vietnam!

170
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,688
- Ow. Ow.
- Bullshit.

171
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,899
"And if it's quite all right"

172
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:40,152
One flight!
It's one flight upstairs!

173
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:44,156
When I come home- One flight.

174
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:46,033
I love Angela.

175
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:49,745
And she loves me.

176
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,834
Wear a scarf today!

177
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,588
You don't wear a scarf
with a tuxedo.

178
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,342
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

179
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:57,771
- You tryin' to look like a prince?
- What do you mean "trying"?

180
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:01,901
You should've done that
a long time ago.

181
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,320
- That way, it would've set.
- I know.

182
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:07,656
- Then why didn't you do it?
- 'Cause I forgot.

183
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:14,538
Oh, man.

184
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,458
Steven's gettin' married
in a couple of hours.

185
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,794
We're talkin' about huntin'
the last time before the army.

186
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:25,466
The whole thing, it's crazy.

187
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:28,052
I'll tell ya one thing.

188
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:30,888
If I found out my life
had to end up in the mountains,

189
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,848
I'd be all right.

190
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,768
But it has to be
in your mind.

191
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:37,770
What?

192
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:40,773
One shot?

193
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:45,027
Two is pussy.

194
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,363
I don't think about one shot
that much anymore, Mike.

195
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:50,074
You have to think about one shot.
One shot is what it's all about.

196
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:52,034
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

197
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:55,079
I try to tell people that.
They don't listen.

198
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,503
- You really think about Vietnam?
- Yeah.

199
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,840
I don't know. I guess.

200
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:10,469
I'm thinkin' about the deer.
Going to Nam.

201
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:13,973
I like the trees, you know?

202
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:17,977
I like the way the trees are in the mountains,
all the different-

203
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:23,274
The way the trees are.

204
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,987
I sound like
some asshole, right?

205
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:33,242
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the only guy
I go huntin' with, you know?

206
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:36,495
I like a guy with quick moves and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

207
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,789
- Well, who's an asshole?
- Who's an asshole?

208
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:41,417
Who do you think's
an asshole?

209
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,961
They're all a bunch of assholes.

210
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:48,007
I mean, I love 'em. They're great guys,
but without you, I'd hunt alone.

211
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,885
- Seriously, that's what I'd do.
- Well, you're a fuckin' nut.

212
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:55,889
You know that, Mike.
You're a maniac, control freak.

213
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,891
I just don't like
no surprises.

214
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,690
- Damn thing won't open.
- Well, give it a kick.

215
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:06,901
Hey, man, hey, hey,
not like that. Not-

216
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,570
Here, here, here.

217
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:11,822
- See that?
- Fuckin' A.

218
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:16,785
Unreal.

219
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:21,415
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

220
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:24,126
You know, I love Mike's car.

221
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,795
Yeah, some cars, they just sit.

222
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:30,507
You never know with a car like this
where the hell it's gonna take you.

223
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:34,094
Yeah.
It makes me feel safe.

224
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,975
Oh, what is he doing?

225
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:44,021
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

226
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:50,319
- Axel, get out of there.
- Let's get the carnations.

227
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:53,572
Get up. Get up.
What are you doing?

228
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:57,201
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, God, you're impossible.

229
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:00,704
- Here, put this on, you have to have that on.
- Crummy tuxedo.

230
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:03,707
Tuxedo's been stuck a million times.

231
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:07,086
- Where'd you get this thing?
It's not funny.

232
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:10,506
- I'm beautiful, right? I'm beautiful.
- No, you're not.

233
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,424
- All set.
- Thanks, Amy.

234
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:23,394
You can't even
sit up, Axel. Oh!

235
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:27,147
- Axel, come on. Sit up.
- Beautiful.

236
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:35,614
Linda, what's the matter?
I was gonna pick you up.

237
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:37,700
Hi.

238
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:40,119
- What's the matter?
- He hit me.

239
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:47,126
Hey, come here, come here.
I wanna ask you something.

240
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,086
Hey, wait a minute,
goddamn it.

241
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,589
You don't walk away from me.
What is that on your face?

242
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,051
Nicky, you and Michael,
you're goin' away in a couple of days.

243
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:59,346
I was just wonderin'
if I could use this place to stay.

244
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:03,309
- Oh, sure.
- I'd wanna pay you both.

245
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,228
- And I was thinking-
- What are you talkin' about?

246
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:13,193
I would wanna
pay you, Nick.

247
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:17,781
Hey, Kochatka,
it's me you're talking to.

248
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:22,328
You know, how long
have you known me for?

249
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:24,496
What?

250
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:26,540
I don't know.

251
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,617
Have you, Steven,
a free will and a firm intention...

252
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:27,286
to take unto yourself
as wife this woman, Angela,

253
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:29,079
whom you see before you?

254
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,247
I do.

255
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:35,794
- You have not promised yourself to any other bride?
- I have not.

256
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:38,505
Have you, Angela,
a free will and a firm intention...

257
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:41,175
to take unto yourself
as husband this man, Steven,

258
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,093
whom you see before you?

259
00:24:43,135 --> 00:24:44,470
I have.

260
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,891
- You have not promised yourself to any other man?
- I have not.

261
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:55,189
Blessed is the kingdom
of the Father and of the Son...

262
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:57,149
and of the Holy Spirit,

263
00:24:57,191 --> 00:25:02,196
now and ever
and unto ages of ages.

264
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:08,077
"Amen"

265
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,558
"Entreat, entreat
the Lord"

266
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,355
"Entreat, entreat the Lord"

267
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:04,109
"And He will have mercy"

268
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:10,824
"On our souls"

269
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:12,900
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:34,964
Oh, hey,
what's going on?

271
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:38,217
For a buck,
you get a shooter, a cigar...

272
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:41,428
and a dance
with the beautiful bride.

273
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:43,305
Fuckin' A.

274
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,308
And you're on your way.

275
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:59,822
Do it. Come on. Do it.

276
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:30,227
Whoo!

277
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,717
May I have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?

278
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,638
Quiet, please, please.

279
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:14,146
That's really wonderful. Thank you.
May I have your attention, please?

280
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:16,232
I have a very,
very important announcement.

281
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:19,985
Whoever owns-

282
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:23,948
Whoever owns a white Chevy Impala,
would you please move it?

283
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:26,825
It's blocking the driveway.

284
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:32,539
Whoever owns
a white Chevy Impala,

285
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,543
it's blocking the driveway.

286
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:39,546
A white Chevy Impala.

287
00:33:45,928 --> 00:33:48,597
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

288
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:51,225
Angela and Steven
would like to welcome you...

289
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,852
and to introduce you
to their bridal party,

290
00:33:53,894 --> 00:33:56,313
and especially
to Michael and Nick,

291
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:59,233
who are also going to Vietnam
with Steven...

292
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:02,861
to proudly serve their country.

293
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:56,373
"You're just too good to be true"

294
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:59,960
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

295
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:01,962
Will you dance with me?

296
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:08,886
Monday, Monday's the day.
Yeah, Monday, Monday.

297
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,057
You're so sweet.
Thanks for being my maid of honor.

298
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,272
Dance, dance.

299
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:22,233
You want me to-

300
00:35:22,274 --> 00:35:26,278
You nut, you want me to dance?
You want me to dance? Hey, Nicky!

301
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:32,493
Michael, Michael!

302
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:37,665
Oh, my God.

303
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:39,667
- Hey, how ya been?
- Excuse me.

304
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:42,753
Hey, Nick, Nick,
you know, you know,

305
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:44,797
you know that I'd be going
with you guys...

306
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,383
if, if, if it wasn't
for my knees.

307
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:49,885
You know that?

308
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:51,887
Wait.

309
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:04,108
"I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right"

310
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:08,070
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely nights"

311
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:11,365
"Oh, I love you, baby"

312
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:14,577
"Trust in me when I say"

313
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:17,454
"Oh, pretty baby"

314
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:21,375
"Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby"

315
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,919
"Now that I've found you
Stay"

316
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:26,380
"And let me love you, baby"

317
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:30,259
"Let me love you"

318
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:34,054
"You're just too good
to be true"

319
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:37,683
"Can't take my eyes
off of you"

320
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:41,520
"You feel like heaven
to touch"

321
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:45,316
"I want to hold you so much"

322
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:48,986
"At long last
love has arrived"

323
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:52,406
I'm not the greatest dancer
in the world.

324
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,492
- You're okay.
- I am not.

325
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:59,121
No, you're very fancy.

326
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:03,751
You want a beer
or something like that?

327
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:07,171
- You want a beer or something?
- Okay. Sure.

328
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:10,424
- What kind of beer would you like?
- What? I don't know.

329
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:13,594
- What kind of beer would you like?
- I don't care. Any kind.

330
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:16,055
- I'll get you a Rolling Rock.
- Okay.

331
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:19,516
- That's a good beer, it's the best around.
- Huh? Yeah, okay.

332
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:21,894
- Rolling Rock?
- Yeah.

333
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,896
Be right back.

334
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:27,524
"Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray"

335
00:37:27,566 --> 00:37:31,320
"I need you, baby
to warm the lonely night"

336
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:35,115
"I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say"

337
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:39,286
You wanna come?
I'll get you-

338
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:42,498
"Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray"

339
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:45,709
"Oh, pretty baby
Now that I've found you, stay"

340
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:49,505
"And let me love you, baby"

341
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:51,507
"Let me love you"

342
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:53,467
Hey, Jerry.

343
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:56,178
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

344
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,181
Jerry, give us two
Rolling Rocks...

345
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:01,934
and give me a Kessler
on the side.

346
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:04,603
It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.

347
00:38:04,603 --> 00:38:08,607
You're supposed to let go
and have fun and all that.

348
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:12,111
You really like Nick a lot, huh?

349
00:38:12,152 --> 00:38:14,113
Anybody else for a shooter?

350
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:17,116
Yeah.

351
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:51,317
Axel!

352
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,236
Put me down!
What are you doing?

353
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:56,655
Axel! Help!

354
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:12,296
Axel, no!
Axel, put me down!

355
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:14,548
- What are you doing? Oh, Axel.
- I'm gonna kiss you.

356
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,968
Stop! Stop!
I'm gonna stab you.

357
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,347
- You wanna fuck or fight?
- Axel!

358
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,564
I think I might like to dance
with the lady, if you don't mind.

359
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:40,074
Have you known him long?

360
00:39:52,169 --> 00:39:55,047
This is the most fun
I've had in months.

361
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:09,562
Do you know what that son of a bitch
is doing?

362
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:15,359
He's got his hand
on her ass!

363
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:19,363
It's only-
It's only-

364
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:23,284
- It's only a wedding.
- What do you mean, "It's only a wedding"?

365
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:26,745
The guy- Look, he did it again!
He just did it!

366
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:31,166
- Come on. I gotta go get my gun out of my coat.
- Go get your gun. Go get it.

367
00:40:55,774 --> 00:40:58,277
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

368
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,779
Time out. Time out!

369
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:21,133
You hurt me, you-

370
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:23,594
You punched me right there.
It hurts.

371
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,767
Is that better?

372
00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:51,872
I'm gonna kick
on his fuckin' ass.

373
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:56,085
- Hey, Stan is crazy.
- Why? What happened?

374
00:41:56,126 --> 00:41:58,087
- That Stan is crazy.
- What happened?

375
00:41:58,128 --> 00:42:00,047
It's a Green Beret!

376
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:04,051
- Hey! Whoo!
- No kidding.

377
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:06,679
Jerry!
Jerry, give the man a drink.

378
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,516
- Hey!
- Give him a drink!

379
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:13,102
- Sir! Sir!
- Sir!

380
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,645
Na zdorovije.

381
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,897
- Na zdorovije.
- Na zdorovije.

382
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,780
Don't cause any kind
of problem, huh?

383
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:28,617
Nah, I wanna talk to the man. I wanna talk to the man.
We're goin' over there.

384
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,703
Sir, Mike Vronsky.

385
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:38,711
- Nick. This is the groom, Steve.
- I'm the best man.

386
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:42,590
We're goin' airborne, sir.
What's it like?

387
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,592
- I hope they send us where the bullets are flyin'.
- That's right.

388
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:48,095
- Fighting's the worst, huh?
- That's right.

389
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:50,014
Fuck it.

390
00:42:51,098 --> 00:42:53,601
- Fuck it? What did he say?
- Fuck it.

391
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:56,562
Fuck it.
That's what I thought.

392
00:42:56,604 --> 00:43:00,024
W- Well, what's it like
over there?

393
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:03,402
Can you tell us anything?

394
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,321
Fuck it.

395
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,533
Okay, fuck it.

396
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,535
Fuck him.

397
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:18,834
Fuck it. Hey!

398
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:21,086
Michael, hey.

399
00:43:21,128 --> 00:43:23,505
- Hey.
- Fuck who?

400
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:27,301
Fuck who?

401
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:30,930
- Who the hell is he?
- Who the fuck knows?

402
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:33,098
He looks like a fuckin' hillbilly.

403
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,101
Give him another drink, Jerry.
Just the same.

404
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:38,646
Hey! Fuck it!

405
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:41,106
Fuck you.

406
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:45,819
Hey! Hey!

407
00:43:57,623 --> 00:44:00,209
Hey! Hey!

408
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:12,555
Steven.

409
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:14,723
Hey! Hey!

410
00:44:19,228 --> 00:44:21,647
Hey! Hey!

411
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:32,533
Oh!

412
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:43,627
Hey! Hey!

413
00:44:52,761 --> 00:44:54,847
Hey! Hey!

414
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:14,033
I got it!

415
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,374
Will you marry me?

416
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:26,253
Yeah.

417
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:29,256
You would?

418
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:31,217
Mm-hmm.

419
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:35,262
What I mean is
if we get back from-

420
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:37,723
I mean, when we get back.

421
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:39,725
I don't know
what the hell I mean.

422
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:43,479
I think what goes through your mind
comes out your mouth.

423
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:45,481
Angela and Steven,

424
00:45:48,651 --> 00:45:50,611
if you don't spill a drop,

425
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:53,656
it's good luck
for the rest of your life.

426
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:14,004
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

427
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:17,466
Whoo!

428
00:48:17,508 --> 00:48:20,094
Don't worry what Stan says.
Just forget that.

429
00:48:20,135 --> 00:48:22,805
- He's got a big fucking mouth.
- Right.

430
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:24,807
- Huh?
- That's enough.

431
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:26,767
- Hey!
- Come here.

432
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:29,728
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

433
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:35,526
Great. That's great.

434
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:39,863
That's my last one true secret.

435
00:48:39,905 --> 00:48:42,700
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

436
00:48:42,741 --> 00:48:45,619
Angela, Angela!

437
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:50,499
Oh, Angela.

438
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:52,501
What am I gonna do
when she has the baby?

439
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:54,503
- That's Angela's part, right?
- That's right.

440
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:56,505
- Just hang loose.
- Hang loose?

441
00:48:56,547 --> 00:48:58,591
Be happy.

442
00:48:58,632 --> 00:49:01,510
Go on. Get out of here.
We don't wanna see you anymore.

443
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:03,429
Look at this maniac.

444
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,808
I'll see you Monday
on the train.

445
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,395
- Hey.
- Drive carefully.

446
00:49:11,437 --> 00:49:15,816
- You didn't know that about Angela, huh? Right?
- Oh, that's bullshit.

447
00:49:15,858 --> 00:49:18,235
- Oh, it's bullshit, right? Yeah?
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.

448
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:20,195
- I happen to know it's true.
- That's bullshit.

449
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:22,197
- I happen to know it's true. All right?
- You're full of bullshit.

450
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,409
- Do you wanna bet? Put your money where your mouth is.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

451
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,536
- Go fuck yourself, Stan.
- Huh? Go fuck yourself.

452
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:31,540
- Fuck you.
- Ah, grow up.

453
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:35,419
Hey! Hey! All right!

454
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,143
Michael, Michael, what are you doing?

455
00:49:51,185 --> 00:49:55,147
- Mike! Hey, Mike!
- Michael!

456
00:49:55,356 --> 00:49:59,318
Michael, what the hell are you doing?

457
00:49:59,652 --> 00:50:02,821
- Michael!
- Hey!

458
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:06,158
Michael, what the hell
are you doing? Michael!

459
00:50:06,158 --> 00:50:09,620
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Fuck it!

460
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,458
Michael, come back here!
What the hell is he doing?

461
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,543
Michael, what the hell are you doing?

462
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,629
- Hey, Mike!
- Michael, come back here!

463
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:20,589
Come here, Michael!

464
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,133
You know we love you!
Get back here!

465
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:27,930
Hey, Mike!
I gotta talk to you!

466
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,941
Mike!

467
00:50:45,948 --> 00:50:47,866
Hey!

468
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:14,643
Shit!

469
00:51:17,062 --> 00:51:19,648
I must be out of
my fuckin' mind.

470
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,651
I must be out of my mind.

471
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:29,867
I don't know.
Everything's going so fast.

472
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:32,369
Man, oh, man.

473
00:51:32,411 --> 00:51:34,872
Hey, Nick.

474
00:51:36,874 --> 00:51:39,251
Think we'll ever come back?

475
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:41,253
- From Nam?
- Yeah.

476
00:51:44,757 --> 00:51:47,051
You know something?

477
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:52,389
The whole thing,
it's right here.

478
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:54,350
I love this fuckin' place.

479
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,435
- You're crazy, man.
- I know that sounds crazy.

480
00:51:56,477 --> 00:52:00,481
If anything happens, Mike,
don't leave me over there.

481
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:04,068
You got- You gotta-
Just don't leave me.

482
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:07,488
- You gotta promise me that, Mike.
- Hey.

483
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:10,449
No, man, you got-
you gotta-

484
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:13,369
You gotta promise definitely.

485
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,537
- Hey, Nicky.
- Huh?

486
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:19,291
- You got it, pal.
- Promise?

487
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:04,044
"Shout Geronimo, Geronimo"

488
00:53:04,086 --> 00:53:07,298
"It's a silk and check your canopy
and take a look around"

489
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:10,551
"The air is filled with troopers
set for battle on the ground"

490
00:53:10,593 --> 00:53:13,762
"'Til we join the stick of angels
Kill the lengthy Amazon"

491
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:17,391
- "Shout Geronimo, Geronimo"
- It's the Screaming Eagles Airborne song.

492
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:20,477
"It's a gory road to glory, But we're ready
Here we go"

493
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:23,063
- "Shout Geronimo"
- Screaming assholes.

494
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:26,066
- "Geronimo, look out below"
- Fuckin' A.

495
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,944
- "Look out below"
- "Let me be free"

496
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:32,489
- "Let me be free"
- I don't remember the rest of the words.

497
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:34,450
"So let me be free"

498
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:39,204
- "You'll always be happy with me"
- Chickenshit, get scared.

499
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,263
Oh, boy.

500
00:53:56,305 --> 00:53:58,224
Fuckin' cold.

501
00:54:00,726 --> 00:54:03,187
Thirty-six beers.

502
00:54:03,229 --> 00:54:06,482
- Whoo! What?
- Come on.

503
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:08,692
All right,
I'll go on, already.

504
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:10,611
Wait, wait.

505
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:19,828
You ever piss and take a drink of beer
at the same time?

506
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:25,417
Whoa.

507
00:54:27,836 --> 00:54:30,631
Ah, I just barely
got a chance to shake it off.

508
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:32,508
Wait! Come on!
Oh, fuck!

509
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:38,013
Bastards!

510
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:41,433
Sons of bitches!

511
00:55:17,136 --> 00:55:20,014
- You guys goin' my way?
- Come on.

512
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:28,022
Fuck!

513
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:35,321
That's not funny!

514
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:54,840
No fuckin' around now.

515
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:59,845
Come on. Stick around.
Don't fuck around.

516
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:03,349
All right?
No fuckin' around.

517
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:34,672
- Lemme out! Lemme out!
- Out, out. Get out.

518
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,220
This is not it.
Definitely.

519
00:56:41,262 --> 00:56:43,264
- They changed it.
- No kidding.

520
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:45,224
Somehow they changed it.

521
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:49,853
- Like this happens every goddamn year.
- You're full of shit, Stanley.

522
00:56:49,895 --> 00:56:52,648
- Who did you say was full of shit?
- You're full of shit.

523
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:56,360
- You're always full of shit.
- I'm starvin'.

524
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:59,238
Eat that.

525
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,615
Nick, how come
I never see you eatin'?

526
00:57:01,657 --> 00:57:04,326
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

527
00:57:04,368 --> 00:57:07,746
- It ain't natural. Come on, John.
- Hey! That's mine.

528
00:57:07,788 --> 00:57:11,125
- You really want it that bad?
- You're goddamn right.

529
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:15,671
- Hey, give me a Twinkie, Mike.
- What are you guys, a bunch of cripples?

530
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:26,515
- That's mustard!
- What?

531
00:57:26,557 --> 00:57:29,935
He put mustard
on his Twink-

532
00:57:29,977 --> 00:57:32,813
You're talkin' like
a goddamn traffic cop.

533
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:35,900
- Oh, fuck-
- Come on. Give me a beer, Mike.

534
00:57:35,941 --> 00:57:38,944
- Come on. Come on.
- I can't believe you guys.

535
00:57:38,986 --> 00:57:41,572
- What the hell am I doing with you?
- This is not it.

536
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:44,325
They changed it.
Somehow they changed it.

537
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:48,370
- You couldn't find your own ass with two hands.
- Fuckin' A.

538
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:53,292
Hey, you know, we forgot
to toast Steven and Angela.

539
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:55,461
Steven and Angela!

540
00:57:55,502 --> 00:57:59,965
Na zdorovije!

541
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:06,096
What?

542
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,642
Don't make me laugh
when I have things in my mouth.

543
00:58:09,683 --> 00:58:12,269
I can't take you guys anyplace.
What the hell you doin'?

544
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:14,647
Get your hands
off the fuckin' bread.

545
00:58:14,688 --> 00:58:17,191
You can dress 'em up,
but you can't take 'em anywhere.

546
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:19,151
Oh, come on.
Come on!

547
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:21,987
What the fuck you doin'?
That was mine, you assholes.

548
00:58:27,201 --> 00:58:30,079
Fuckin' assholes.
I can't fuckin'-

549
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,540
- Fuckin' A!
- What the fuck?

550
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:36,502
You know, Axel, you got
a terrific vocabulary.

551
00:58:36,544 --> 00:58:39,296
- Fuckin' A.
- Hey, watch the gear.

552
00:58:39,338 --> 00:58:42,091
Watch the rifle.
Axel, gimme my bag.

553
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:46,679
It's gettin' cold, huh?

554
00:58:48,097 --> 00:58:51,100
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

555
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,985
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

556
00:59:02,194 --> 00:59:04,113
Never mind. I got 'em.

557
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,491
Where the hell's my boots?

558
00:59:10,494 --> 00:59:12,955
Anybody see my boots?

559
00:59:12,997 --> 00:59:16,417
Somebody took my boots.
I bought 'em special.

560
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,214
All right. All right, you guys.
Whoever took my boots, I want 'em back.

561
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:25,885
I got a boot for you, Stan,
right up your ass.

562
00:59:25,926 --> 00:59:27,803
Hey, Mike.

563
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:33,100
Hey, Mike, lemme borrow
your spares, huh?

564
00:59:33,142 --> 00:59:36,103
- Your extra pair?
- No, Stan.

565
00:59:36,145 --> 00:59:38,105
No?

566
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:43,694
- What do you mean, "No"?
- Just what I said. No. No means no.

567
00:59:45,821 --> 00:59:48,991
Some fuckin' friend.
You're some fuckin' friend, you know that?

568
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:52,119
Every time you come here,
you got your head up your ass.

569
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:55,623
Maybe he likes the view from up there.

570
00:59:59,627 --> 01:00:02,796
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife, no jacket.

571
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:05,174
He's got no pants, no boots.

572
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:08,719
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries like John Wayne.

573
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:10,679
That ain't gonna help ya.

574
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:13,474
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

575
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:17,519
No, I ain't givin' him no boots.
No more. That's it.

576
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:21,523
You're a fuckin' bastard,
you know that? Huh?

577
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:23,567
Stanley, see this?
This is this.

578
01:00:23,609 --> 01:00:26,820
This ain't somethin' else.
This is this.

579
01:00:26,862 --> 01:00:29,740
From now on, you're on your own.

580
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,913
I fixed you up a million times.

581
01:00:35,955 --> 01:00:38,374
I fixed him up a million times.

582
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:40,834
I don't know how many times
I must've fixed him up with girls.

583
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:43,504
And nothin' ever happened. Zero.

584
01:00:43,546 --> 01:00:47,174
You know your trouble, Mike?
Nobody ever knows what you're talkin' about.

585
01:00:47,216 --> 01:00:50,844
"This is this. " What the hell's
that supposed to mean? "This is this. "

586
01:00:50,844 --> 01:00:53,847
Is that faggot-soundin' bullshit,
or is that faggot-soundin'-

587
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:57,101
Shut up, Stan, will ya?
Hey, man, you're outta line.

588
01:00:57,142 --> 01:01:00,312
Watch out with that gun, Stan.
Watch out with the gun.

589
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:04,233
Do you know what I think? There's
times I swear I think you're a faggot.

590
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:06,193
Hey, come on, you guys.

591
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:09,446
Last week he could've had that new
redheaded waitress at the Bowladrome.

592
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:11,740
He could've had it,
but look what he did.

593
01:01:11,782 --> 01:01:14,201
Nothin', that's what.

594
01:01:14,243 --> 01:01:17,413
Shut up, Stan.
Just shut up!

595
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:21,917
Just shut up. Take- Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up.

596
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:24,920
Otherwise, I'm goin' home.
I'm goin' home right now.

597
01:01:24,962 --> 01:01:29,258
Get off my stuff.
What the hell're you doin'?

598
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:33,512
Hey, Stosh.

599
01:01:33,512 --> 01:01:35,639
I said, "No. "

600
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:43,355
What? Are you gonna
shoot me? Huh?

601
01:01:44,356 --> 01:01:46,525
Here.

602
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:07,671
What's the matter with you?

603
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:10,341
Stan.

604
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:26,912
Watch it, Mike! Pow! Whack!

605
01:05:32,418 --> 01:05:36,005
Hey! Hey, Angela!

606
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:42,803
Bums! Go home!
Go home!

607
01:05:55,816 --> 01:05:57,776
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

608
01:05:57,818 --> 01:06:00,195
"Through the goalposts of life"

609
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:04,074
"End over end
Neither left nor to right"

610
01:06:04,116 --> 01:06:08,120
"Straight through the heart
of the righteous uprights"

611
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:18,214
"Drop-kick me, Jesus,
through the goalposts of life"

612
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:22,218
"End over end
Neither left nor to right"

613

614
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:28,974
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

615
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:31,936
"Through the goalposts of life"

616
01:06:31,977 --> 01:06:33,896
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

617
01:06:33,938 --> 01:06:35,981
"Through the goalposts of life"

618
01:06:36,023 --> 01:06:41,403
"End over end, end over end

619
01:06:41,403 --> 01:06:46,742
"Straight through the heart

620
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:48,786
"Drop-kick me, Jesus"

621
01:06:48,827 --> 01:06:52,748
"Through the goalposts of life"

622
01:10:38,307 --> 01:10:41,685
Un-fuckin'- believable.

623
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:31,402
Oh, Christ.
I don't believe it.

624
01:11:32,528 --> 01:11:34,863
- Mike?
- Mike!

625
01:11:34,905 --> 01:11:37,199
Jesus Christ!
Hey!

626
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:39,618
Incoming!

627
01:13:32,356 --> 01:13:35,442
Steven, take it easy.
Stevie!

628
01:13:35,484 --> 01:13:38,362
Stevie, calm down!

629
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:48,706
Think of something else.

630
01:13:48,747 --> 01:13:50,749
Tell yourself to think
of something else.

631
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:59,049
We don't belong here.

632
01:14:16,358 --> 01:14:18,819
Stevie, take it easy.

633
01:14:18,861 --> 01:14:22,364
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

634
01:14:22,406 --> 01:14:25,868
I'm all right.
- It's gonna be okay.

635
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:45,137
I'm okay.

636
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:49,141
Okay, just take it easy.

637
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:53,062
It's okay. It's okay.

638
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:54,980
Take it easy.
Stevie, take it easy.

639
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:00,861
Mike?

640
01:15:07,785 --> 01:15:11,580
Come on. Come on. Come on.

641
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:14,667
I'm okay.

642
01:15:41,193 --> 01:15:45,573
Easy. Okay. Okay.

643
01:15:45,614 --> 01:15:48,200
All right, press hard.
Press hard. Press hard.

644
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:50,995
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

645
01:15:51,036 --> 01:15:53,789
Go ahead. That's it.
That's it.

646
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:56,292
Mike.

647
01:15:58,502 --> 01:16:01,171
Shake it off.

648
01:16:01,213 --> 01:16:03,465
Shake it off. Shake it out.

649
01:16:03,465 --> 01:16:05,676
Think of something else.

650
01:16:05,718 --> 01:16:09,305
Think of home.
Think of home.

651
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:56,602
- Come on.
- They're gonna have to kill my ass, Mike.

652
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:00,689
Stevie, you gotta do it.

653
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:03,400
You don't do it,
they're gonna throw you in the pit.

654
01:17:03,442 --> 01:17:06,070
They throw you in the pit,
you're gonna die.

655
01:17:06,111 --> 01:17:08,781
Go ahead. You gotta do it.
You can do it.

656
01:17:08,822 --> 01:17:11,408
You can do it, Stevie.
You can do it.

657
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:18,999
Look in my eyes.

658
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:21,043
Stevie?
Stevie, look at me!

659
01:17:21,043 --> 01:17:23,671
- Mike?
- Do it!

660
01:17:23,712 --> 01:17:27,132
Go ahead.
Show 'em you got balls.

661
01:17:27,174 --> 01:17:29,093
Aw, fuck you.

662
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:33,138
Go ahead. Shoot me! Go ahead!

663
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,643
Come on.

664
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:43,899
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Stevie!

665
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:46,610
Go ahead! Show 'em you got balls!

666
01:17:46,652 --> 01:17:48,821
Go ahead!

667
01:18:02,126 --> 01:18:04,587
Hey, kid. Kid.

668
01:18:04,628 --> 01:18:07,840
Look at me, Stevie. You did it.

669
01:18:11,427 --> 01:18:13,387
Stevie.

670
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:16,432
You showed these bastards.
Showed 'em.

671
01:18:28,736 --> 01:18:32,031
Don't worry, kid.

672
01:18:32,072 --> 01:18:33,949
You did it.

673
01:18:50,549 --> 01:18:55,262
- Michael! Michael!
- Stevie!

674
01:19:02,436 --> 01:19:07,858
Michael!

675
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:15,866
Stevie!
Stevie, don't worry!

676
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:18,327
Mike!

677
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:20,496
Mike! Oh!

678
01:19:20,538 --> 01:19:22,623
Oh, God.

679
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:25,459
Michael, there's rats in here.

680
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:47,565
Nicky-

681
01:19:54,446 --> 01:19:59,451
Motherfucker!

682
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:02,788
Nicky, listen.

683
01:20:06,876 --> 01:20:09,587
It's up to us now.
It's me and you.

684
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:12,089
What about Steven?

685
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:14,633
Forget him.

686
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:17,970
- Forget him?
- He ain't gonna make it.

687
01:20:18,012 --> 01:20:20,556
Who do you think
you are? God?

688
01:20:22,766 --> 01:20:24,727
Look at him.
He's in a daze.

689
01:20:24,768 --> 01:20:27,271
He ain't comin' out.
He's in a dream.

690
01:20:27,313 --> 01:20:29,315
Mike, what are you saying?

691
01:20:29,315 --> 01:20:31,317
I'm saying forget him.

692
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:33,235
Get it through your head,

693
01:20:33,277 --> 01:20:35,696
or you and me are both gone too.

694
01:20:43,287 --> 01:20:45,289
We gotta play with more bullets.

695
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:47,166
- What?
- More bullets.

696
01:20:49,501 --> 01:20:53,505
I gotta get more bullets
in the gun.

697
01:20:53,589 --> 01:20:56,050
- What?
- We gotta play with more bullets.

698
01:20:56,091 --> 01:20:58,302
- More bullets in the gun?
- More bullets in the gun.

699
01:20:58,302 --> 01:21:01,305
How many more bullets?

700
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:03,599
Three.

701
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:13,776
That means we gotta play each other.

702
01:21:13,776 --> 01:21:16,779
- More bullets against each oth-
- We gotta do it.

703
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,782
- What? Are you crazy?
- Nicky, it's the only way.

704
01:21:22,284 --> 01:21:25,162
I'll pick the moment.
The game goes until I move.

705
01:21:25,162 --> 01:21:27,998
When I start shootin',
go for the nearest guard,

706
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,251
get his gun,
zap the fucker.

707
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:33,379
- I'm not ready for this.
- You gotta listen to me.

708
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,589
You wanna stay
down here and die?

709
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:40,177
Go on.
It's up to you.

710
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:42,179
- Now it's up to you.
- No!

711
01:21:42,221 --> 01:21:44,181
- No!
- Hey, him against me!

712
01:21:44,223 --> 01:21:46,475
Side by side!

713
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:51,689
- Side by side!
- Get away! Get away!

714
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,607
Me and him!
Me against him!

715
01:21:54,692 --> 01:21:59,321
Michael!

716
01:22:35,524 --> 01:22:39,194
Come on! These fuckers-

717
01:22:39,236 --> 01:22:41,822
These fuckers-
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

718
01:22:41,864 --> 01:22:44,408
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

719
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,702
Go ahead. Go ahead, Nicky.

720
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:05,638
I do three bullets.
Three.

721
01:23:05,638 --> 01:23:07,806
Three. We do three, huh?

722
01:23:07,806 --> 01:23:09,934
One, two, three.
Three.

723
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:22,446
Three. Three.

724
01:23:28,244 --> 01:23:30,913
Three. Three.

725
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:37,753
Don't worry. Five minutes,
we're gonna be outta here.

726
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:39,630
We're gonna be outta here.

727
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:43,551
Yeah.

728
01:23:49,723 --> 01:23:51,725
Now we got ourselves a game.

729
01:23:51,767 --> 01:23:53,686
You and me.
You and me.

730
01:23:53,727 --> 01:23:55,646
Now we got ourselves a game.

731
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:18,210
Okay. Okay.

732
01:24:18,252 --> 01:24:20,254
You wanna see it?
All right.

733
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:25,968
There.

734
01:24:34,268 --> 01:24:36,937
No more. No. No more.

735
01:24:42,151 --> 01:24:44,111
I'm gonna will us out of here.

736
01:24:44,153 --> 01:24:46,155
You got an empty chamber in that gun.

737
01:24:46,196 --> 01:24:48,157
Put an empty chamber
in that gun!

738
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:51,160
Go ahead.

739
01:24:56,665 --> 01:24:58,709
Goddamn it!

740
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:00,753
It's gonna be all right, Nicky.

741
01:25:00,794 --> 01:25:03,047
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot, Nicky!

742
01:25:03,047 --> 01:25:05,257
Goddamn you,

743
01:25:05,299 --> 01:25:08,636
You motherf-

744

No, no, no, no, Nicky!

745
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:15,176
Oh! You cock-

746

Oh! Oh, you're gonna die,

747
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:20,139
You're gonna die!

748
01:25:22,141 --> 01:25:24,102
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Nicky.

749

Just do it. Do it.
Do it! Do it!

01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,440
Go ahead!

751
01:25:34,946 --> 01:25:36,823
You made it.
You made it.

752
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,122
It's all right, Nicky.

753
01:25:44,122 --> 01:25:48,126
All right,
we're gonna show 'em.

754
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:51,546
That's good, Nicky.

755
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:59,429
All right. All right.

756
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:40,261
Come on, Nicky.
Come on.

757
01:26:40,303 --> 01:26:42,263
Come on! Nicky-

758
01:26:42,305 --> 01:26:44,807
Come on.

759
01:26:44,849 --> 01:26:47,977
Nicky, come on.
Damn it!

760
01:26:47,977 --> 01:26:49,979
Come on!

761
01:26:53,357 --> 01:26:55,359
Shit.

762
01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:01,574
Get me up.

763
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,453
Steve!

764
01:27:08,664 --> 01:27:10,666
Get up. Get up.

765
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,585
Get up!

766
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,674
Michael. Michael.

767
01:27:20,259 --> 01:27:22,178
Michael!

768
01:27:26,057 --> 01:27:28,059
Stevie, come on.
Come on, Stevie.

769
01:27:28,101 --> 01:27:30,061
We're gonna go for a swim.
Come on.

770
01:27:30,103 --> 01:27:32,355
Stevie.

771
01:27:32,355 --> 01:27:34,273
Come on. Come on.

772
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,364
We don't belong
here in the jungle, Michael.

773
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:45,451
Get on. Go on.
Just get on, see?

774
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:50,581
- Just get on.
- There's rats in these waters.

775
01:27:50,623 --> 01:27:52,875
- These w-
- Hold on.

776
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:55,169
Hold on right there.

777
01:27:55,211 --> 01:27:57,088
Hold on.

778
01:28:12,478 --> 01:28:14,689
- Michael.
- Okay, buddy.

779
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:22,989
Mike.

780
01:28:28,786 --> 01:28:31,497
Nicky!

781
01:28:53,311 --> 01:28:56,773
Mike!

782
01:28:56,814 --> 01:28:58,816
I wanna go home, Mike.

783
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:03,923
What is that sound?

784
01:30:05,425 --> 01:30:07,927
What's that sound, Michael?

785
01:30:20,606 --> 01:30:24,610
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

786
01:31:32,637 --> 01:31:34,639
Go ahead! Go ahead!

787
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,892
Mike! Mike!

788
01:31:37,934 --> 01:31:40,937
Hold on, Michael! Don't let go!

789
01:31:42,438 --> 01:31:44,565
Mike!

790
01:31:49,445 --> 01:31:52,365
No! Mike!

791
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:33,364
Stevie!

792
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:57,972
I hit some rocks, Michael.

793
01:32:58,014 --> 01:32:59,932
I hit some rocks.

794
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,976
- Are you all right?
- Michael.

795
01:33:02,018 --> 01:33:04,353
- Okay.
- My legs-

796
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:08,357
Come on. Come on.

797
01:33:09,776 --> 01:33:13,780
Stevie, come on.

798
01:33:19,285 --> 01:33:21,245
M- Mike,

799
01:33:21,287 --> 01:33:23,372
I hit some rocks.

800
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:26,334
Okay.

801
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:28,377
All right.

802
01:33:31,798 --> 01:33:33,758
That's it.

803
01:33:33,758 --> 01:33:36,177
- That's it.
- My arm.

804
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:41,599
I can't feel my legs.

805
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:45,061
All right. Come on.

806
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,572
Push yourself up.

807
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:13,464
Shh!

808
01:34:13,506 --> 01:34:17,510
Okay. Okay, kid. Okay.

809
01:34:17,593 --> 01:34:21,597
Shh! Shh!

810
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,449
Hi.

811
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:51,038
Hi.

812
01:37:57,146 --> 01:37:59,148
Ah.

813
01:38:05,363 --> 01:38:08,449
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

814
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:13,162
Can you understand me, Nikanor?

815
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,543
Excuse me?

816
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:21,712
- Are you Chevotarevich? Are you sure?
- Yes.

817
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:24,882
Uh-huh. Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

818
01:38:28,177 --> 01:38:31,139
No. It's American.

819
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:33,349
All right.
Let me see your name tag.

820
01:38:35,685 --> 01:38:39,647
- This yours?
- It's his.

821
01:38:39,689 --> 01:38:45,570
- What are your parents' names?
- Lou and, uh-

822
01:38:45,611 --> 01:38:49,532
My mother's name is, uh-

823
01:38:49,574 --> 01:38:53,453
- Tsk. Eva.
- Uh-huh.

824
01:38:53,453 --> 01:38:56,456
And what are your parents'
dates of birth?

825
01:39:03,796 --> 01:39:08,676
What the-

826
01:39:41,793 --> 01:39:45,797
We're gonna have
to get him outta here.

827
01:40:14,117 --> 01:40:15,993
Sure, sure.

828
01:40:17,787 --> 01:40:20,289
Excuse me.

829
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:26,712
Some more noise, uh-huh.

830
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:29,298
Hello?

831
01:40:30,299 --> 01:40:34,595
Uh, I'm calling
the United States.

832
01:40:36,222 --> 01:40:39,225
Clairton, Pennsylvania.

833
01:40:41,519 --> 01:40:45,440
C- L-A...

834
01:40:45,481 --> 01:40:49,360
I- R-T-O-N.

835
01:40:49,402 --> 01:40:53,072
Pennsylvania. Right.

836
01:40:53,072 --> 01:40:56,701
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

837
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:03,082
Never mind.

838
01:41:03,124 --> 01:41:06,127
Nothing, nothing.
No. Never mind. Nothing.

839
01:41:15,928 --> 01:41:19,932
Hey, back off, Jack!
Back off.

840
01:41:20,224 --> 01:41:24,228
Well, just do that.

841
01:42:08,147 --> 01:42:10,108
Mike?

842
01:42:10,149 --> 01:42:12,151
Hello. How are you?

843
01:42:12,151 --> 01:42:14,153
- Hey.
- Mike?

844
01:42:16,948 --> 01:42:20,952
Mike? Hey, Mike.

845
01:42:21,035 --> 01:42:24,247
Sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

846
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:43,224
- "Too much for the man"
- "Too much for the man"

847
01:42:43,266 --> 01:42:45,393
"He couldn't make it"

848
01:42:45,435 --> 01:42:49,439
"So he's leavin'
the life he's"

849
01:42:49,522 --> 01:42:52,150
"He's come to know"

850
01:42:52,191 --> 01:42:54,110
"Ooh, ooh"

851
01:42:54,152 --> 01:42:59,365
- "He said he's goin'"
- "He said he's going back to find"

852
01:42:59,365 --> 01:43:01,325
"Going back to find"

853
01:43:01,367 --> 01:43:04,746
"Ooh, ooh, ooh
What's left of his world"

854
01:43:06,831 --> 01:43:10,460
"The world he left behind"

855
01:43:10,501 --> 01:43:15,298
"Not so long ago"

856
01:43:15,339 --> 01:43:18,342
- How are you?
- Okay.

857
01:43:18,384 --> 01:43:20,511
"He's leavin'"

858
01:43:20,553 --> 01:43:26,434
- "On that midnight train to Georgia"
- I show you. Come.

859
01:43:26,476 --> 01:43:29,520
- "Yeah"
- Not like the girls home in U.S.A.

860
01:43:29,562 --> 01:43:32,523
- I make you crazy.
- "Goin' back to find"

861
01:43:32,565 --> 01:43:36,027
- "To a simpler place and time"
- I make you crazy.

862
01:43:36,069 --> 01:43:38,738
- "Oh, yes, he is"
- "Guess who's gonna be right by his side"

863
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:42,533
- No, I don't wanna.
- Come.

864
01:43:42,575 --> 01:43:47,080
"Leavin' on that
midnight train to Georgia"

865
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:50,208
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"

866
01:43:50,249 --> 01:43:53,503
"I'd rather live in his world"

867
01:43:53,544 --> 01:43:56,756
"Than live without him in mine"

868
01:44:00,176 --> 01:44:02,845
"Mmm, L.A."

869
01:44:02,887 --> 01:44:05,556
Come on inside.

870
01:44:15,066 --> 01:44:19,487
Okay, what you like
call me now, hmm?

871
01:44:19,487 --> 01:44:23,032
What you like call me?

872
01:44:23,074 --> 01:44:25,785
- Linda.
- Linda. Just like home.

873
01:44:25,827 --> 01:44:28,955
No, no.
Thank you.

874
01:44:28,955 --> 01:44:32,250
Come back here.
Come back here.

875
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:36,963
- Call- Call- Call me Linda.
- Hey, look.

876
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:40,258
Elephants.

877
01:44:40,258 --> 01:44:42,760
I gotta get an elephant.

878
01:44:42,802 --> 01:44:45,346
No!

879
01:44:45,388 --> 01:44:47,890
I can't stay here in a room
with a kid cryin'.

880
01:44:47,932 --> 01:44:50,059
- Come on.
- No. No!

881
01:44:50,059 --> 01:44:54,063
Why don't you pay me first?
Fuck you!

882
01:44:56,274 --> 01:45:01,279
Oh. Oh.

883
01:45:04,574 --> 01:45:07,201
"The snow does snow"

884
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:09,746
"The rain does rain"

885
01:45:09,787 --> 01:45:12,290
"The wind does blow"

886
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:16,586
"The rain does rain"

887
01:45:16,627 --> 01:45:18,963
"The snow does snow"

888
01:45:19,005 --> 01:45:21,299
"The wind does blow"

889
01:46:13,393 --> 01:46:16,104
You seem disturbed.

890
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,870
People inside
doing it for money?

891
01:46:32,912 --> 01:46:36,457
Sometime a great deal of money.

892
01:46:36,499 --> 01:46:39,293
I cannot play
this kind of game myself.

893
01:46:39,335 --> 01:46:42,797
But I'm always-
How do you say?

894
01:46:42,797 --> 01:46:47,593
Looking out for those things
quite different, quite rare.

895
01:46:49,303 --> 01:46:52,223
Champagne, perhaps?

896
01:46:52,265 --> 01:46:54,183
No.

897
01:46:54,225 --> 01:46:57,979
Tsk, tsk. Don't say no.

898
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:02,024
When a man say no to champagne,
he say no to life.

899
01:47:06,404 --> 01:47:09,031
You saw this before?

900
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,578
Up north.

901
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:15,997
Oh, yes. Of course.

902
01:47:16,038 --> 01:47:21,043
- Gotta go.
- But you must come in.

903
01:47:21,043 --> 01:47:23,629
I insist.

904
01:47:26,507 --> 01:47:31,137
Of what is there to be afraid of
after this war? War is a joke.

905
01:47:31,179 --> 01:47:33,806
- A silly thing.
- I'm going home, ace!

906
01:47:33,848 --> 01:47:36,809
Naturellement
I pay my players...

907
01:47:36,851 --> 01:47:39,979
cash, American.

908
01:47:40,021 --> 01:47:45,026
However, should you prefer German marks
or perhaps Swiss franc,

909
01:47:45,068 --> 01:47:47,111
that, of course,
can be arranged.

910
01:47:47,111 --> 01:47:50,114
- I can arrange everything.
- You got the wrong guy, ace.

911
01:47:50,156 --> 01:47:52,617
- But you must come in.
- Don't do that.

912
01:47:52,658 --> 01:47:55,244
But I insist.

913
01:49:13,448 --> 01:49:15,158
Nick!

914
01:49:37,054 --> 01:49:38,181
Hey, Nick!

915
01:50:02,789 --> 01:50:05,792
Hey! Nick! Nick!

916
01:50:07,085 --> 01:50:11,589
- Listen, if you are very brave and lucky,
- Hey, Nick!

917
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:14,592
I can make you
very, very rich.

918
01:50:50,169 --> 01:50:53,673
Wow. Would you
look at that?

919
01:50:55,675 --> 01:50:58,469
- Just keep goin'. Just keep goin'.
- You said Logan Street.

920
01:50:58,511 --> 01:51:01,305
- I just want to keep goin'.
- The trailer. It's right there.

921
01:51:01,305 --> 01:51:04,600
Just wait 'til Michael
gets here, huh?

922
01:51:04,642 --> 01:51:07,979
This is it!
This is Michael!

923
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:10,148
- Oh!
- All right.

924
01:51:10,189 --> 01:51:14,193
Everybody, stay where you are!
I'll go get him.

925
01:51:14,277 --> 01:51:16,612
Three cheers
for the red, white and blue.

926
01:51:16,612 --> 01:51:20,575
Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!

927
01:51:20,783 --> 01:51:24,704
Hip, hip, hurray!

928
01:51:30,376 --> 01:51:33,296
- That cab ain't stoppin'.
- What's goin' on?

929
01:51:37,091 --> 01:51:41,971
I can't wait for him
to see all this stuff.

930
01:51:42,013 --> 01:51:45,767
- What happened?
- Hey, Stosh, what happened? I thought it was him.

931
01:51:45,808 --> 01:51:51,689
So his plane could be late.
Take it easy, will ya, Axel? You're drivin' everyone nuts.

932
01:51:54,317 --> 01:51:56,486
You okay?

933
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:07,080
I know Nick will be back soon.

934
01:52:07,121 --> 01:52:11,501
I know Nick.
He'll be comin' back too.

935
01:52:11,542 --> 01:52:14,879
- Right, Axel?
- Fuckin' A.

936
01:52:14,921 --> 01:52:19,509
- Go straight on down to the highway.
- It's your bread, man.

937
01:56:01,981 --> 01:56:04,192
It's open!

938
01:56:17,663 --> 01:56:21,667
Forget something-
Michael?

939
01:56:23,169 --> 01:56:28,049
Oh, Michael! Oh!

940
01:56:28,091 --> 01:56:32,095
Oh, Michael!
Oh, Michael!

941
01:56:32,386 --> 01:56:34,680
Tsk! Oh, my God.

942
01:56:34,722 --> 01:56:38,351
Oh, gee.

943
01:56:38,393 --> 01:56:41,646
Gee, you look beautiful.

944
01:56:41,687 --> 01:56:45,441
Oh, uh, let me
take your coat.

945
01:56:45,483 --> 01:56:49,153
Oh! Everybody was here.
You missed them all.

946
01:56:49,195 --> 01:56:54,992
Oh. They're gonna be so mad
when they find out they missed you.

947
01:56:58,788 --> 01:57:00,706
Welcome home.

948
01:57:06,379 --> 01:57:08,881
You know, I was hopin'-

949
01:57:08,881 --> 01:57:14,303
I was hopin' somehow, Michael,
maybe you had... Nick with you.

950
01:57:14,345 --> 01:57:18,808
No. No.

951
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:29,402
You hear anything on Nick?

952
01:57:31,612 --> 01:57:33,698
No.

953
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:37,744
Nothing.
He's A.W.O.L.

954
01:57:37,785 --> 01:57:39,912
That's all we know.

955
01:57:39,954 --> 01:57:42,373
Tsk.

956
01:57:42,415 --> 01:57:44,083
He'll be back.

957
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:48,504
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

958
01:57:48,546 --> 01:57:50,506
Maybe you were out.

959
01:57:52,717 --> 01:57:54,594
Yeah. Maybe.

960
01:58:00,099 --> 01:58:02,268
So how are you anyway?

961
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:05,229
I'm fine. Okay.
How are you?

962
01:58:05,229 --> 01:58:08,691
Uh, me? I'm okay.

963
01:58:08,733 --> 01:58:10,777
I'm fine.
I go along, you know.

964
01:58:10,818 --> 01:58:15,698
Still workin' at the market there.
There's a million things to do.

965
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:19,077
Y- You sure
you're all right, huh?

966
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:22,580
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- What about your wounds?

967
01:58:22,622 --> 01:58:27,502
It was nothin'.
Just the usual complications, that's all.

968
01:58:27,502 --> 01:58:31,506
- We heard.
- No, that's not true, a lot of guys go through it.

969
01:58:31,631 --> 01:58:35,635
Hmm. Tsk.

970
01:58:35,927 --> 01:58:39,305
I made Nick that sweater.

971
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:48,689
I couldn't remember
the exact size, but-

972
01:58:48,731 --> 01:58:51,818
I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

973
01:58:54,737 --> 01:58:59,700
No. Too big. Whoops.

974
01:58:59,742 --> 01:59:02,995
Well, I could fix that, though.
I mean-

975
01:59:03,037 --> 01:59:05,832
One thing about wool,
it's really a cinch...

976
01:59:08,918 --> 01:59:11,129
to fix.

977
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:13,339
Oh, Christ.

978
01:59:16,217 --> 01:59:20,221
It's okay.

979
01:59:24,142 --> 01:59:26,102
It's okay.

980
01:59:26,144 --> 01:59:30,189
- How's your job?
- Great. Fine. Yeah.

981
01:59:30,231 --> 01:59:34,235
Once or twice
we almost had to close.

982
01:59:34,277 --> 01:59:36,154
I gotta go to work now.

983
01:59:37,947 --> 01:59:40,116
- Gotta go now?
- Yeah.

984
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,954
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

985
01:59:46,456 --> 01:59:51,502
Mikie, you're so... weird.

986
01:59:51,544 --> 01:59:54,756
You're always such a gentleman.

987
01:59:54,797 --> 01:59:57,049
Tsk. Well-

988
02:00:01,929 --> 02:00:04,057
- It's cold out there.
- Yeah.

989
02:00:04,098 --> 02:00:07,018
I'm not used to it.

990
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:10,646
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

991
02:00:10,688 --> 02:00:13,649
I'm so happy.

992
02:00:15,068 --> 02:00:17,570
I really don't know
what I feel.

993
02:00:46,766 --> 02:00:49,352
- Hey, Jack.
- Hello. How are you?

994
02:01:10,373 --> 02:01:13,876
Linda, uh,
I just want to say...

995
02:01:13,918 --> 02:01:16,421
how sorry I am about Nick.

996
02:01:16,462 --> 02:01:20,967
And how- I know how much
you loved him and...

997
02:01:21,008 --> 02:01:24,762
I know that it'll
never be the same.

998
02:01:24,804 --> 02:01:28,141
I just wanted
to tell you that.

999
02:01:28,182 --> 02:01:32,186
Maybe- I don't know-
Maybe you don't want to talk about it.

1000
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:51,664
How's it goin', hot lips?

1001
02:01:51,664 --> 02:01:56,085
Yeah, a new kid.
A real tough guy.

1002
02:01:57,295 --> 02:01:59,672
It's okay.

1003
02:02:00,798 --> 02:02:03,760
Mike.

1004
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:07,472
Why don't you come in with me?
Just say hello.

1005
02:02:07,513 --> 02:02:11,184
Oh, Mike, please.
They want to see you. I know.

1006
02:02:11,225 --> 02:02:13,352
Just for a second, okay?
Okay.

1007
02:02:13,394 --> 02:02:17,398
Hey, look who's here.
It's Michael. Hey, everybody.

1008
02:02:19,192 --> 02:02:23,196
- Oh, Michael, I read about you in the paper.
- Helen!

1009
02:02:23,279 --> 02:02:26,240
- Let me-
- Oh, Michael. Oh, dear.

1010
02:02:26,282 --> 02:02:28,993
- Doesn't he look terrific, Janie?
- Hi, Michael.

1011
02:02:29,035 --> 02:02:31,037
- Mike!
- How beautiful you look.

1012
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:35,500
- You look good, Mike. Welcome back.
- We're glad he's home.

1013
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:39,212
- Wait a minute. Look at his medals.
- Congratulations.

1014
02:02:39,212 --> 02:02:42,673
- There's gotta be 20.
- Oh, Michael.

1015
02:02:42,715 --> 02:02:46,677
- Helen! Come on.
- Janie, leave me alone.

1016
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:50,681
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1017
02:02:50,681 --> 02:02:55,812
- I have to go to work now.
- We better- Good seeing you.

1018
02:02:55,853 --> 02:02:59,315
- See ya, Michael. See ya, Michael.
- Come see us.

1019
02:02:59,315 --> 02:03:01,776
Bye.

1020
02:03:01,818 --> 02:03:04,445
- Can I see you later?
- Okay.

1021
02:03:04,487 --> 02:03:07,115
- After work?
- Yeah. Where?

1022
02:03:07,156 --> 02:03:10,284
- Home?
- Home? Okay.

1023
02:03:40,106 --> 02:03:42,483
- One beer at John's. One beer.
- One?

1024
02:03:42,483 --> 02:03:44,819
- Uh-
- Come on. I'll buy ya a beer.

1025
02:03:44,861 --> 02:03:47,029
I'm in. All right.
Just one.

1026
02:03:47,071 --> 02:03:49,198
Hey, Axel. Hey, Stosh. Axhead.

1027
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,076

1028
02:03:52,118 --> 02:03:55,329

02:03:55,371 --> 02:03:58,207
Hey, man. How ya doin'?
Hey, where was you?

1030
02:03:58,249 --> 02:04:00,084
- Where was you?
- Where were you?

1031
02:04:00,126 --> 02:04:02,420
We had everything all set there.
Beer, food.

1032
02:04:02,462 --> 02:04:07,216
- Fuckin' A.
- I got delayed.

1033
02:04:07,258 --> 02:04:10,011

- Hey-

1034
02:04:11,137 --> 02:04:14,223
- You got a mustache.
- Yeah.

1035
02:04:14,265 --> 02:04:16,309
Looks pretty good.

1036
02:04:16,309 --> 02:04:19,771
- It looks cute.
- Yeah, it looks-

1037
02:04:19,812 --> 02:04:23,232
Come on.
We're goin' to John's.

1038
02:04:23,274 --> 02:04:26,778
So how you guys been?

1039
02:04:26,819 --> 02:04:29,197
Hangin' in there.
You know.

1040
02:04:29,197 --> 02:04:31,532
How's it feel to be shot?

1041
02:04:31,574 --> 02:04:34,702
- It don't.
- Oh.

1042
02:04:34,744 --> 02:04:37,413
It don't hurt.
If that's what you wanna know.

1043
02:04:37,455 --> 02:04:40,333
How youse been?
Been okay?

1044
02:04:40,374 --> 02:04:43,086
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1045
02:04:43,127 --> 02:04:46,798
Same old thing, you know.
Nothing's changed.

1046
02:04:46,839 --> 02:04:50,635
I'm gettin' more ass than a toilet seat,
and Axel's gettin' fatter than ever.

1047
02:04:50,676 --> 02:04:56,349
Hey! Hey, Stan,
why don't you show him that gun?

1048
02:04:56,391 --> 02:04:58,893
Shh! Take it easy.

1049
02:04:58,935 --> 02:05:01,229
That little pussy thing you carry
around back there. Look at that.

1050
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:03,606
- Watch it.
- What's that for?

1051
02:05:03,648 --> 02:05:06,150
- Same thing the other one was for.
- And what was that for?

1052
02:05:06,192 --> 02:05:08,403
- He's a worrier.
- Ah, forget it.

1053
02:05:08,444 --> 02:05:10,655
- Let's go have a drink.
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

1054
02:05:10,655 --> 02:05:12,615
"So long time forgotten"

1055
02:05:12,657 --> 02:05:17,453
- "Seems a good spell that I loved you"
- Look what I found.

1056
02:05:17,495 --> 02:05:19,497
Hey, Mikie!

1057
02:05:19,539 --> 02:05:23,251
Let this man through!
Let him through!

1058
02:05:25,837 --> 02:05:28,965
Hey, John!
Good to see ya!

1059
02:05:28,965 --> 02:05:32,927
Boy, oh, boy!

1060
02:05:33,052 --> 02:05:35,138
Come on.
Come on in the back.

1061
02:05:35,179 --> 02:05:41,644
In the back.
Come on!

1062
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:46,899
What the hell's
goin' on here?

1063
02:05:46,941 --> 02:05:50,570
- Goddamn.
- Stosh, get the glasses on the sink.

1064
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:54,157
- The dirty ones?
- Yeah, use the dirty ones.

1065
02:05:54,198 --> 02:05:57,160
Holy shit! What did you do?

1066
02:05:57,201 --> 02:06:00,121
Win the war
all by yourself?

1067
02:06:00,163 --> 02:06:02,165
- Look at this stuff.
- No help from you.

1068
02:06:02,206 --> 02:06:03,916
- Huh?
- Here we go!

1069
02:06:03,958 --> 02:06:08,755
Misha. Na zdorovije.
To you, Mike.

1070
02:06:08,796 --> 02:06:11,215
Na zdorovije to everybody.

1071
02:06:11,257 --> 02:06:13,551
- Fuckin' A.
- Na zdorovije!

1072
02:06:13,593 --> 02:06:16,262
- Na zdorovije!
- Hey! Hey!

1073
02:06:16,304 --> 02:06:18,931
Wait, wait!
To Nick and Steve!

1074
02:06:18,973 --> 02:06:22,060
- To Nick and Steve.
- Nick and Steve.

1075
02:06:33,946 --> 02:06:36,574
You look great.

1076
02:06:40,661 --> 02:06:42,872
How's Angela?

1077
02:06:48,086 --> 02:06:52,548
- Not so good, Mike, worse since she talked to him.
- Talked to who?

1078
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:54,217
Steven.

1079
02:06:54,258 --> 02:06:57,762
She talked to Steve?
I didn't know he was back.

1080
02:06:57,804 --> 02:07:00,973
- You didn't know he's back?
- Oh, Jesus.

1081
02:07:01,015 --> 02:07:04,352
No, I didn't know.
Is he back?

1082
02:07:04,394 --> 02:07:07,772
- You- You- You didn't-
- Where is he? Where is he?

1083
02:07:07,814 --> 02:07:09,357
- Come on, John.
- Come on.

1084
02:07:09,399 --> 02:07:10,733
Where is he?

1085
02:07:10,775 --> 02:07:12,944
- I don't know.
- Just answer me. Where is he?

1086
02:07:12,985 --> 02:07:16,364
- Just tell me where he is?
- I don't know where he is, Mike.

1087
02:07:16,406 --> 02:07:20,284
- Angela wouldn't tell us. Mike.
- What do you mean?

1088
02:07:20,326 --> 02:07:22,370
She wouldn't talk to anybody!

1089
02:07:22,412 --> 02:07:24,664
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

1090
02:07:46,602 --> 02:07:48,604
Boom!

1091
02:08:00,992 --> 02:08:03,077
Angela.

1092
02:08:05,079 --> 02:08:09,083
I heard Steven was alive.
Where is he?

1093
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:16,007
Where's Steven?

1094
02:08:18,301 --> 02:08:22,305
Where is he?
Just tell me where it is.

1095
02:08:25,308 --> 02:08:27,351
Angela, where is Steve?

1096
02:08:27,393 --> 02:08:32,106
- Uh, uh-
- Just tell me where he is.

1097
02:08:33,983 --> 02:08:39,697
Where is he?

1098
02:08:39,739 --> 02:08:43,159
Please.

1099
02:08:43,201 --> 02:08:46,496
You gotta tell me.
Now where is he?

1100
02:08:46,537 --> 02:08:49,791
Do you know?
Where is he?

1101
02:09:20,613 --> 02:09:22,698
Take care.

1102
02:10:10,538 --> 02:10:13,082
Michael?

1103
02:10:13,124 --> 02:10:15,585
Right here.

1104
02:10:15,626 --> 02:10:18,212
- Whatcha doin'?
- Nothin'.

1105
02:10:18,212 --> 02:10:20,631
Just got my gear,
and I was gonna go.

1106
02:10:20,673 --> 02:10:22,592
- What?
- I was gonna go.

1107
02:10:22,633 --> 02:10:25,428
Don't go.
I have, uh, all this food.

1108
02:10:25,470 --> 02:10:28,222
I'll make you
a nice sit-down dinner.

1109
02:10:28,264 --> 02:10:31,726
- I-I can't.
- Mikie.

1110
02:10:37,356 --> 02:10:39,442
Why don't we go to bed?

1111
02:10:43,529 --> 02:10:47,533
C- Can't we just comfort
each other?

1112
02:10:47,658 --> 02:10:51,621
No, I can't. Not here.
I gotta get outta here.

1113
02:10:51,829 --> 02:10:54,290
Sorry.
I just gotta get out.

1114
02:10:54,332 --> 02:10:56,709
I'll be-
Look, I don't know.

1115
02:10:56,751 --> 02:11:01,047
I feel a lot of distance,
and I feel far away. I'll see ya later.

1116
02:11:36,374 --> 02:11:40,336
It feels kind of weird...

1117
02:11:40,378 --> 02:11:42,630
comin' to a motel.

1118
02:11:42,672 --> 02:11:44,674
You know what I mean, Michael?

1119
02:11:44,674 --> 02:11:48,678
Mike?

1120
02:12:43,191 --> 02:12:45,818
Go ahead.

1121
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:49,864
I got to put my can down
for this one.

1122
02:12:49,906 --> 02:12:53,868
Ha! Ha!

1123
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:06,464
"Here we are
staring at each other"

1124
02:13:09,175 --> 02:13:15,098
"With that crazy look
in our eyes"

1125
02:13:15,098 --> 02:13:17,767
Michael, it's on the house.

1126
02:13:17,767 --> 02:13:20,395
- "It happens every time"
- No, thanks.

1127
02:13:20,436 --> 02:13:24,399
"We get together"

1128
02:13:26,275 --> 02:13:32,198
"Did we ever really
say good-bye"

1129
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:35,701
How ya feelin'?
You okay?

1130
02:13:35,743 --> 02:13:38,955
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1131
02:13:38,996 --> 02:13:43,584
"Then our eyes keep looking
at each other"

1132
02:13:43,626 --> 02:13:47,588
All right!

1133
02:13:47,797 --> 02:13:50,258
Yea, Linda!

1134
02:13:50,299 --> 02:13:54,303
- What do you think of her, Mike?
- I don't know.

1135
02:13:54,512 --> 02:13:58,516
- No, come on. On the level.
- I don't know, Stosh.

1136
02:13:58,599 --> 02:14:02,228
Is she-
Is she beautiful?

1137
02:14:02,270 --> 02:14:05,898
Is she beautiful? Is she?

1138
02:14:09,193 --> 02:14:11,195
- The truth?
- Yeah!

1139
02:14:11,237 --> 02:14:13,239
No.

1140
02:14:13,239 --> 02:14:15,158
No?

1141
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:19,203
- No.
- Well, do you think she's intelligent?

1142
02:14:19,287 --> 02:14:24,417
- No.
- Neither do I.

1143
02:14:30,298 --> 02:14:33,092
I don't think
she's intelligent either.

1144
02:14:33,092 --> 02:14:38,222
- What the hell you see in her?
- I don't know, that's what I came to ask you.

1145
02:14:38,264 --> 02:14:41,726
- Maybe she's good in bed.
- Why don't you ask her?

1146
02:14:46,022 --> 02:14:49,192
Whoa!

1147
02:14:49,192 --> 02:14:52,570
"Oh, it's somethin'"

1148
02:14:52,612 --> 02:14:56,324
"How they read
between the lines"

1149
02:14:59,410 --> 02:15:04,415
"Tattletale eyes
tell what's on our minds"

1150
02:15:07,627 --> 02:15:10,505
Now where the fuck
is my fuckin' ball?

1151
02:15:10,546 --> 02:15:12,590
Goddamn pinsetter!

1152
02:15:12,632 --> 02:15:15,802
- "Tattletale eyes"
- Where's he goin'?

1153
02:15:15,843 --> 02:15:18,304
Axel! Axel!

1154
02:15:23,518 --> 02:15:25,436
Michael!

1155
02:15:29,524 --> 02:15:32,568
What the hell happened?

1156
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:36,906
- The pinsetter came down.
- Stan, get the jack out of my trunk.

1157
02:15:40,410 --> 02:15:43,746
Shit. Nothin' works
around this damn place anymore.

1158
02:15:43,746 --> 02:15:46,207
We're gettin' you clear here.

1159
02:15:46,249 --> 02:15:48,835
Watch your elbow here.
All right, you got it.

1160
02:15:48,876 --> 02:15:51,254
All right, belly burn.

1161
02:15:51,295 --> 02:15:54,465
You all right, man?

1162
02:15:54,507 --> 02:15:57,635
- Hey!
- Fuckin' A!

1163
02:15:58,344 --> 02:16:01,013
What do you guys
want to do now, huh?

1164
02:16:01,013 --> 02:16:03,933
- We're goin' huntin', right?
- Who asked you?

1165
02:16:03,975 --> 02:16:06,853
- Who the hell asked you?
- I was askin' Mike.

1166
02:16:06,853 --> 02:16:09,814
- He's goin'.
- Yeah, Mike's goin'.

1167
02:16:09,856 --> 02:16:13,818
- But no women.
- Just like old times, hey, am I right?

1168
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:17,822
- Just like old times?
- Fuckin' A!

1169
02:17:50,164 --> 02:17:52,333
Are you kiddin' me, Axel?

1170
02:17:52,375 --> 02:17:56,129
Forty times
we could've had it!

1171
02:17:56,170 --> 02:17:59,882
If I'd have been
where you are.

1172
02:18:09,559 --> 02:18:13,980
Go get 'im, Axel!

1173
02:18:15,690 --> 02:18:17,567
Fuck you guys.

1174
02:18:37,587 --> 02:18:41,924
- Oh, how sweet it is.
- Fuckin' A.

1175
02:18:41,966 --> 02:18:46,262
Jesus Christ.
What the hell is that?

1176
02:18:46,304 --> 02:18:50,641
Hey!

1177
02:18:50,683 --> 02:18:54,687
Hey! Hey, John!
Axel! I got one!

1178
02:18:57,774 --> 02:19:01,569
Hey, fellas! I got one!

1179
02:19:48,116 --> 02:19:49,992
Okay?

1180
02:20:19,605 --> 02:20:24,819
Okay!

1181
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:42,420
What's that stupid little gun
doin' up here?

1182
02:20:45,923 --> 02:20:47,884
In case.

1183
02:20:47,925 --> 02:20:50,887
In case?
In case of what?

1184
02:20:50,928 --> 02:20:52,930
In case you stumble
on one of your girlfriends...

1185
02:20:52,972 --> 02:20:55,433
sucking on
a forest ranger's cock?

1186
02:20:56,726 --> 02:20:59,812
You say that one more time.

1187
02:20:59,854 --> 02:21:02,899
Say it!
Go on. Say it!

1188
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:06,027
Stanley, you're so full of shit
you're gonna float away.

1189
02:21:06,069 --> 02:21:07,904
Try me!
You try me!

1190
02:21:07,904 --> 02:21:09,906
- Just say it!
- You're gonna float away.

1191
02:21:09,947 --> 02:21:13,409
- Easy, Mike.
- Ow! Hey!

1192
02:21:13,409 --> 02:21:15,912
- Take it easy, Mike.
- What the hell was that for?

1193
02:21:15,953 --> 02:21:18,831
What? You think it was loaded?
Gimme that.

1194
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:26,339
Don't.

1195
02:21:32,428 --> 02:21:36,349
You wanna play games?
All right, I'll play your fuckin' games.

1196
02:21:39,808 --> 02:21:41,810
- Hey!
- How do you feel now?

1197
02:21:41,851 --> 02:21:45,105
Huh? Huh?

1198
02:21:45,105 --> 02:21:49,109
- Hey!
- Big shot!

1199
02:23:11,358 --> 02:23:13,401
Hi, Michael!

1200
02:23:13,443 --> 02:23:15,528
- Linda's in back.
- She's in the back?

1201
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:18,531
- Yeah. Hey, how was the hunting?
- It was fine. Thanks.

1202
02:23:29,959 --> 02:23:32,170
Linda, what's the matter?

1203
02:23:35,465 --> 02:23:37,467
I don't know.

1204
02:23:40,053 --> 02:23:42,389
What's the matter?

1205
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:44,766
Noth-
I don't know.

1206
02:23:49,646 --> 02:23:51,648
Well, it's gotta be somethin'.

1207
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,029
I got the car outside.

1208
02:23:58,029 --> 02:24:00,156
Yeah. Well, that's okay.

1209
02:24:01,449 --> 02:24:03,410
You sure?

1210
02:24:03,451 --> 02:24:05,954
No, it's okay.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1211
02:24:08,081 --> 02:24:09,958
Really.

1212
02:24:25,056 --> 02:24:28,018
Have a nice night.

1213
02:24:28,059 --> 02:24:30,854
Good night!
See you tomorrow.

1214
02:24:36,192 --> 02:24:38,361
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1215
02:24:41,072 --> 02:24:43,116
No. I think
I'll go with him.

1216
02:24:43,158 --> 02:24:45,160
- Okay? Thanks.
- Well, okay.

1217
02:24:54,586 --> 02:24:58,298
You okay?

1218
02:25:00,675 --> 02:25:03,595
Did you ever think life
would turn out like this?

1219
02:25:06,598 --> 02:25:08,475
No.

1220
02:27:40,126 --> 02:27:42,045
"I" 27.

1221
02:27:45,548 --> 02:27:48,176
- "N" 40.
- Bingo!

1222
02:27:48,218 --> 02:27:52,138
We have a bingo.
Johnny-come-lately.

1223
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:54,516
Where are you, Johnny?

1224
02:27:54,557 --> 02:27:56,518
There you are.

1225
02:27:56,518 --> 02:27:59,020
- "B" 15. "I" 16.
- Right.

1226
02:27:59,062 --> 02:28:01,064
- Right.
- "N" 33.

1227
02:28:01,106 --> 02:28:02,982
- Right.
- "G" 60.

1228
02:28:03,024 --> 02:28:05,819
We- Yeah.
That's a winner.

1229
02:28:05,819 --> 02:28:08,238
Get outta my road there,
Ivan Stivan.

1230
02:28:08,279 --> 02:28:10,740
I can't see myself smokin'.

1231
02:28:10,782 --> 02:28:13,868
And the next number: "I" 16.

1232
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:16,955
Wish it was I.
Nice sweet 16.

1233
02:28:16,955 --> 02:28:18,915
"I" 18.

1234
02:28:18,957 --> 02:28:21,251
Then you become a man.

1235
02:28:21,292 --> 02:28:23,503
Let's go, men. "G" 60.

1236
02:28:23,545 --> 02:28:25,922
And those that can't
help themselves,

1237
02:28:25,964 --> 02:28:28,425
please, buddy,
help them too.

1238
02:28:28,425 --> 02:28:30,844
Oh, will you dance with me?

1239
02:28:30,885 --> 02:28:33,722
"G" 47.

1240
02:28:33,763 --> 02:28:37,726
But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got,

1241
02:28:37,851 --> 02:28:39,936
that wonderful life I've lived.

1242
02:28:39,978 --> 02:28:42,480
Think it over, buddy boys,

1243
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:44,941
and I'll give you "O" 61.

1244
02:28:49,362 --> 02:28:51,948
Hi. How ya doin'?

1245
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:53,867
Hi.

1246
02:28:56,369 --> 02:28:59,456
Steven, there's a call for you.

1247
02:28:59,497 --> 02:29:01,333
Maybe it's from Angela.

1248
02:29:29,652 --> 02:29:32,864
- Hello.
- Stevie, it's me, Mike.

1249
02:29:32,906 --> 02:29:37,410
Michael?

1250
02:29:37,452 --> 02:29:40,664
- Hey!
- Hey!

1251
02:29:40,705 --> 02:29:42,624
Hey!

1252
02:29:42,666 --> 02:29:45,210
How's things?

1253
02:29:45,251 --> 02:29:49,047
I'm okay. Never mind me.
How are you?

1254
02:29:49,089 --> 02:29:53,718
Great.

1255
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,054

Take that too.
Tell him. Go ahead.

1413
02:46:55,907 --> 02:46:57,951
Et avec ca, ca suffit?

1414
02:47:47,167 --> 02:47:50,879
We don't have much time.
We don't have much time, Nick.

1415
02:48:17,572 --> 02:48:19,491
Don't do it.

1416
02:48:33,213 --> 02:48:35,090
What are you-

1417
02:48:58,488 --> 02:49:03,827
Is this what you want?

1418
02:49:13,712 --> 02:49:16,214
I love you, Nick.

1419
02:49:29,436 --> 02:49:31,312
Don't do it.

1420
02:49:50,623 --> 02:49:53,710
Come on, Nicky.
Come home.

1421
02:49:53,752 --> 02:49:55,920
Just come home. Home.

1422
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:01,009
Talk to me.

1423
02:50:01,009 --> 02:50:05,013
Nicolas, talk to me.

1424
02:50:08,308 --> 02:50:10,894
Nicky. Nicky.

1425
02:50:10,935 --> 02:50:14,689
Wait a minute, Nick.
What did you do to your arms?

1426
02:50:14,731 --> 02:50:18,735
Nicky, do you remember
all the different ways of the trees?

1427
02:50:18,777 --> 02:50:21,780
Do you remember? Huh?

1428
02:50:21,821 --> 02:50:24,616
- The mountains? You remember all that?
- Yeah.

1429
02:50:24,658 --> 02:50:28,244
- One shot.
- One shot. One shot.

1430
02:50:30,914 --> 02:50:33,041
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1431
02:50:37,545 --> 02:50:40,965
Nicky! Nick! Nick!

1432
02:50:41,007 --> 02:50:44,594
Oh! Nicky! Nick!

1433
02:50:44,594 --> 02:50:47,389
Nicky! Nick!

1434
02:50:47,430 --> 02:50:50,433
Nicky! Nicky!

1435
02:50:50,475 --> 02:50:53,395
Don't! Nick! No!

1436
02:50:53,436 --> 02:50:57,232
No! No!
Nicky, you can't!

1437
02:51:08,034 --> 02:51:09,995
This seems to be
the last chapter...

1438
02:51:10,036 --> 02:51:12,914
in the history of American involvement
in Vietnam.

1439
02:51:12,956 --> 02:51:15,667
It's also been the largest
single movement of people...

1440
02:51:15,667 --> 02:51:18,461
in the history
of America itself.

1441
02:51:18,503 --> 02:51:20,797
Hillary Brown, ABC News,

1442
02:51:20,839 --> 02:51:23,758
aboard the attack aircraft carrier
USS Hancock,

1443
02:51:23,800 --> 02:51:26,636
in the South China Sea.

1444
02:52:44,881 --> 02:52:49,678
"May his soul dwell"

1445
02:52:49,719 --> 02:52:55,600
"Among the"

1446
02:52:55,642 --> 02:53:01,481
"Righteous"

1447
02:53:01,523 --> 02:53:04,567
Mommy!

1448
02:53:57,412 --> 02:53:59,414
I'll get these tables.

1449
02:54:07,380 --> 02:54:09,382
Axel, bring those two tables over here.

1450
02:54:09,424 --> 02:54:11,760
I- I'll get it.

1451
02:54:11,801 --> 02:54:15,597
Everybody make yourself at home.
The coffee's already made.

1452
02:55:08,024 --> 02:55:11,027
- Cups. I'll get the cups.
- I'll help you with that.

1453
02:55:11,069 --> 02:55:13,530
I'll help you too, John.

1454
02:55:32,632 --> 02:55:36,177
Oh, hey, there's too many cups.

1455
02:55:36,219 --> 02:55:38,221
How does everybody
want their eggs?

1456
02:55:38,263 --> 02:55:40,932
How about just scrambled, John?

1457
02:55:42,142 --> 02:55:44,019
Toast! Toast.

1458
02:56:03,330 --> 02:56:05,248
- Hey.
- Uh-uh.

1459
02:56:14,424 --> 02:56:16,926
Careful, Linda.
It's hot.

1460
02:56:19,054 --> 02:56:22,140
Hey, Axel, how about some beer?

1461
02:56:26,519 --> 02:56:29,314
Here, uh-
I'll get started on the eggs.

1462
02:56:29,356 --> 02:56:31,358
- Yeah, I'll help you with the eggs.
- No, Linda, Linda.

1463
02:56:31,358 --> 02:56:35,320
Sit down. Sit down.
Pour the coffee.

1464
02:57:08,061 --> 02:57:10,647
It's been such a gray day.

1465
02:57:52,063 --> 02:57:55,025
"Stand beside her"

1466
02:57:55,066 --> 02:57:57,986
"And guide her"

1467
02:58:27,265 --> 02:58:32,187
"God bless America"

1468
02:58:32,228 --> 02:58:36,191
"Land that I love"

1469
02:58:36,232 --> 02:58:39,235
"Stand beside her"

1470
02:58:39,277 --> 02:58:41,780
"And guide her"

1471
02:58:41,821 --> 02:58:44,240
"Through the night"

1472
02:58:44,282 --> 02:58:48,286
"With the light from above"

1473
02:58:48,495 --> 02:58:51,498
"From the mountains"

1474
02:58:51,498 --> 02:58:54,417
"To the prairies"

1475
02:58:54,417 --> 02:58:57,420
"To the oceans"

1476
02:58:57,462 --> 02:59:01,216
"White with foam"

1477
02:59:01,257 --> 02:59:06,471
"God bless America"

1478
02:59:06,513 --> 02:59:11,434
"My home sweet home"

1479
02:59:11,476 --> 02:59:17,232
"God bless America"

1480
02:59:17,273 --> 02:59:22,988
"My home sweet home"

1481
02:59:32,414 --> 02:59:36,292
- Here's to Nick.
- To Nick.

1482
02:59:36,334 --> 02:59:40,797
To Nick.
