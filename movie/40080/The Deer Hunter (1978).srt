1
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,888
Down!

2
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,297
How you doing?

3
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:32,091
Hey, watch out,
Axel.

4
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:34,760
We'll be calling him
old fireballs after tonight.

5
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,264
Really?
Not bad.

6
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,269
Hey, Steve, now that
you're going into the Army,

7
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:43,353
how about giving my $20 back?

8
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,197
All right, boys.

9
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,407
Hey, take care, buddy.

10
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,198
I'll see you, fellows.

11
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:57,241
Freddy!

12
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,242
Hi, Mike!

13
00:04:58,325 --> 00:04:59,368
Be good.

14
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:00,912
Did you hear about
the happy Roman?

15
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,372
Yeah?

16
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:03,624
He was glad he ate her.

17
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,958
Come on, let's go.

18
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,293
Where's Stan?
All right.

19
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,462
Hey, Stan,
let's go!

20
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:08,629
Take care of yourself.

21
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:10,757
Give us a call.
Write us.

22
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,633
Take care. I'll see you later. So long.

23
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:13,676
Okay, bye-bye.

24
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,468
Take care of yourself. Take it easy.

25
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,554
Don't get your ass
shot off.

26
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,890
I won't.
Good luck.

27
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,225
Okay.

28
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:23,019
Hey, Mike, take care of
yourself. Good luck to you.

29
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:24,270
Stay out of trouble.

30
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:26,356
Kill a few for me, too.
I will. Stay out of trouble.

31
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,856
Hey, little killer.

32
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:28,942
Let's go.

33
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:30,319
Hey!

34
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,864
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Hi, Stanley.

35
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,741
Hi, Stanley,
you asshole.

36
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,326
Hey, Stan!

37
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,369
Get back there.

38
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,454
Stan, it's no use.

39
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,039
Come on, Stosh,
you're beautiful now.

40
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,960
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan.

41
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,546
Good luck to you
in the Army.

42
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:48,838
Hey, Stanley!

43
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:51,424
Come on, come on.

44
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,344
Stosh, let's get
the hell out of here.

45
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,930
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

46
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:59,350
Let's go. Come on.

47
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,227
Very mature, very mature,
well-adapted individuals.

48
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,064
Take it easy.
Whoa!

49
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:07,900
Hey, look at that.
Let's go. Come on.

50
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:08,901
Whoa!

51
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,402
What the hell is that?

52
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,320
Where? Oh, yeah.

53
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,283
Holy shit,
you know what that is?

54
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,076
Those are sun dogs.

55
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,327
What does
it mean?

56
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,995
It means a blessing
on the hunter,

57
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,999
sent by the Great Wolf
to his children.

58
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,001
What the fuck are you
talking about?

59
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,753
No, it's an old
Indian thing.

60
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,379
You're full of shit.

61
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:31,340
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

62
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,178
You know, Mike,

63
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:37,430
there's times when nobody but
a doctor can understand you.

64
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,350
That's an omen,
you know that?

65
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,141
You know that we could
have one great

66
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,728
fucking hunting
trip tonight?

67
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,772
Yeah, Mike, I don't know
where the hell

68
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:46,271
you come up
with all this shit.

69
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,233
Hey, wait a minute.

70
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,903
What are you-
What, are you thinking

71
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,988
of going
deer hunting tonight?

72
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,823
No, not tonight.
I'm getting married tonight,

73
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,284
and you fucking guys are
going deer hunting?

74
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,204
Hey, first we get you legal,
tuck you into bed with Angela.

75
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,288
Hey!

76
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:02,581
You guys are
all fucking nuts.

77
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:03,624
Are we mad?

78
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,668
Boy, you're all crazy.
Life is over.

79
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,045
Yeah, right.

80
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:09,087
You're getting married,
we're crazy?

81
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,505
It's all right.

82
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,216
Hey, it's all right.
We'll be right there.

83
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,177
We'll be right with you.
All of us, won't we?

84
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:15,470
Right?
Am I right?

85
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,222
Fuckin' A, man.
Right.

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,806
Come on.

87
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,685
Come on, you guys, I'm buying
the first round this morning.

88
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,102
Hey, hey, Steven!
Steven!

89
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,147
Any, uh, help you might need
tonight, just feel free to call on me.

90
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:27,191
Ooh!

91
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,442
Hey, Stanley, sometimes your
sense of humor ain't funny.

92
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,736
Come on,
Steven.

93
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:31,945
Willing fingers.

94
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,155
Extra lips.

95
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:35,700
Fucking A, man.

96
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,702
Hey, you're a regular poet,
Axel.

97
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,369
I couldn't agree
with you more.

98
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:40,454
Get in there.

99
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:41,581
Come on, come on.

100
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,004
I do.

101
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,758
I do.

102
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,389
I do.

103
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,321
Oh, my God!

104
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,500
I still do not
believe this.

105
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,463
My own boy,
with a strange girl.

106
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,298
And not so thin,
if you understand my meaning.

107
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:33,175
Not such a thin girl.

108
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:36,763
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

109
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,852
I do not understand, Father.

110
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,523
I understand nothing anymore.

111
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,192
Nothing.

112
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:53,362
Why?

113
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,449
Why?

114
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:59,535
Can you explain?

115
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,874
Can anyone explain?

116
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,861
Pass him on the inside.

117
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,112
You'd never do it.

118
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,238
Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to concentrate.

119
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:35,782
It's your Caddy
against my truck.

120
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:36,825
Today your lucky day?

121
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,369
You can't make it.

122
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,755
Oh, boy!

123
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,048
You got it!

124
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,932
Hey, Axel,
you opened the window.

125
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:58,934
Mike!

126
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:00,643
Hey, mighty Mike!

127
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,060
Oh, Axel!

128
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,061
Here's your truck back.

129
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,146
Oh, hell!

130
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,691
Wouldn't wanna
take advantage of you.

131
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:07,776
I hope you didn't
break an axle. Axle!

132
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,194
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

133
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,113
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

134
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:13,780
Did you see that?

135
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,326
Hey, how're you doing?

136
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:20,788
Don't take
anybody's money.

137
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,624
Don't take my money.
Take his money.

138
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,134
Give my friends down here
my warm regards.

139
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,185
Hey, I got $100

140
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,231
says the Eagles never cross
the 50 in the next half.

141
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,400
And the Steelers
win by what? 20.

142
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,735
I got an extra
$20 that says

143
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,487
the Eagles' quarterback
wears a dress.

144
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,905
You got it!

145
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:57,785
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

146
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,685
Oh, did I get all wet?

147
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,770
I don't wanna know.

148
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,361
Amy!

149
00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:35,281
Come on, Amy.

150
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:44,585
You know what,

151
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:47,462
Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

152
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,217
Is that all right?

153
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:53,259
Uh,

154
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,888
up a bit, I would say.
Wouldn't you say so?

155
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,597
No, no, down.

156
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:01,726
Oh, it's a beautiful cake.

157
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,108
You've earned a drink.

158
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,363
You have
a beautiful cake.

159
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:17,743
I haven't forgotten
about you.

160
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:20,871
I have one for you, too.

161
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,942
Go to-Fucking hell.

162
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,949
I'll give every car in
the town a flat tire.

163
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,866
Every goddamned one.

164
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,244
Oh, daddy!

165
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,955
I'll do it.

166
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,961
I fucking mean what I say, girl. Shh.

167
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:08,463
Come on.

168
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:11,383
All around, like a sea. Oh, my God!

169
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,721
Ocean of flat tires.

170
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,348
Fucking..
No.

171
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:18,473
Bitch!

172
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,309
All bitches.

173
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:24,898
I hate them.

174
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:25,982
Daddy.

175
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,358
Daddy, no,
it's me.

176
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:28,568
Fucking bitches.

177
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,781
Give them all flat tires.

178
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,316
<i>"You're just too good
to be true"</i>

179
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:09,985
That's great.

180
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,319
<i>"I can't take my eyes
off of you"</i>

181
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:13,197
Now, I'm gonna smoke your ass.

182
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,200
<i>"You'd be like heaven
to touch"</i>

183
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:19,246
<i>"I wanna hold you so much"</i>

184
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:23,416
<i>"At long last
love has arrived"</i>

185
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,212
<i>"And I thank God I'm alive"</i>

186
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:30,631
It's my shot, right?

187
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:35,095
Come on, John.
Wipe off the tables.

188
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,557
This is it.
This is really it.

189
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:42,311
<i>"There's nothing else
to compare"</i>

190
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,064
I mean, here I go.

191
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:49,570
<i>"There are no words
left to speak"</i>

192
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:54,115
There's no sense
in getting too relaxed, buddy.

193
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,451
<i>"Please let me know
that it's real"</i>

194
00:14:57,576 --> 00:14:58,702
Come on.

195
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>"You're just too good
to be true"</i>

196

00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:24,273

198
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,190
<i>"And if it's quite
all right"</i>

199
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,192
<i>"I need you, baby"</i>

200
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,067
<i>"to warm the lonely night"</i>

201

205
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:44,584

now that I've found you"</i>

206
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:48,464

208
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,467
You faggot.

209
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,971
<i>"You're just too good

210

211
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:02,017
Hey!

00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,358
<i>"I wanna hold you so much"</i>

213
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:16,366
Jesus Christ!

214
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,703
To do this to
your own mother,

215
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:21,081
who prays for you
all her life.

216
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,710
Is your heart so cruel,
so unfeeling?

217
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:29,256
You marry this girl,
you leave her with me,

218
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:32,175
and you go with these bums
to the Vietnam!

219
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,011
Whoa, whoa!

220
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:37,848
One flight.

221
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:39,767
It's one flight upstairs.

222
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:41,269
When I come home..

223
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:42,646
One flight!

224
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:45,356
I love Angela.

225
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,195
And she loves me.

226
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,698
Wear a scarf today.

227
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,329
You don't wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

228
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,375
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

229
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,180
You trying to
look like a prince?

230
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,098
What do you mean,
trying?

231
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,435
You should've done that
a long time ago,

232
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,686
that way it would've set.

233
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:02,770
I know.

234
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,233
Then why didn't you do it?

235
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,566
'Cause I forgot.

236
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:10,111
Can you still see?

237
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,243
For Christ's sake, Mike. Steven is
getting married in a couple of hours,

238
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,871
I don't know
what the hell we're doing

239
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,998
talking about hunting
a last time before the Army.

240
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:23,791
The whole thing,
it's crazy.

241
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,502
I'll tell you one thing.

242
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,342
If I found out my life had
to end up in the mountains,

243
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:32,801
it'd be all right.

244
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:34,470
But it has to be in your mind.

245
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,470
What?

246
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:39,892
One shot?

247
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,315
Two is pussy.

248
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,858
I don't think about one shot
that much any more, Mike.

249
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,361
You have to think about
one shot.

250
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:49,777
One shot is what
it's all about.

251
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,488
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

252
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:54,032
I try to tell people that,
they don't listen.

253
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,040
You really think
about Vietnam?

254
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:02,165
Yeah.

255
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:05,626
I don't know.

256
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,213
I guess I'm thinking
about the deer.

257
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:09,798
Going to Nam.

258
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,969
I like the trees, you know?

259
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,680
I like the way the trees are
in the mountains,

260
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,390
it's all different.

261
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,479
The way the trees are.

262
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,482
I sound like
some asshole, right?

263
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,655
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the
only guy I go hunting with, you know?

264
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,950
I like a guy
with quick moves and speed.

265
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,827
I ain't gonna hunt
with no assholes.

266
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,412
Who's an asshole?

267
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,205
Who do you think's
an asshole?

268
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:42,705
They're all
a bunch of assholes.

269
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,210
I mean, I love them.
They're great guys.

270
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,880
But, you know,
without you, I'd hunt alone.

271
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:49,923
Seriously,
that's what I'd do.

272
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,759
But you're a fucking nut.

273
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:53,593
You know that, Mike?
You're a maniac.

274
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,137
Control freak.

275
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,848
I just don't like
no surprises.

276
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:03,020
Damn thing won't open.

277
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,313
Well, give it
a kick!

278
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,527
Hey, hey, not like that, not
like that. Here, here, here.

279
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,611
See that?

280
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:11,738
Fuckin' A.

281
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:14,824
Unreal.

282
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:20,457
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

283
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:22,415
You know,

284
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,334
I love Mike's car.

285
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,086
Yeah, some cars,
they just sit.

286
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:29,048
I mean, you never know
with a car like this

287
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:30,800
where the hell
it's gonna take you.

288
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,762
It makes me feel safe.

289
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,473
Hey!

290
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:44,146
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

291
00:20:46,482 --> 00:20:48,483
Oh, Axel, get out of there.

292
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,611
Let's get the carnations.
Oh, they're over there.

293
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:52,197
Get up, get up.

294
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:54,491
What are you doing?
Come on, sit up.

295
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,826
Don't pass, Axel!

296
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:58,995
Here, put this on.
You have to have that on.

297
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,831
Crummy tuxedo.

298
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,125
Your tuxedo's been
stuck a million times.

299
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,418
Where'd you get this thing?

300
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,585
Fucking A.

301
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:06,795
You're not funny.

302
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,795
I'm beautiful, right?

303
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:09,630
No, you're not beautiful.

304
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:12,051
All set.
Thanks, honey.

305
00:21:12,676 --> 00:21:14,719
I'm not..
Let go!

306
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:17,264
Let go!

307
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,480
You can't even sit up,
Axel! Oh!

308
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:25,232
Axel, come on, sit up.

309
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:27,108
Beautiful.
Can't even sit up.

310
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:33,532
Linda, what's the matter?

311
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:35,032
I was gonna pick you up.

312
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,535
Hi.

313
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:38,537
What's the matter?

314
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:39,663
He hit me.

315
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:40,829
Don't cry.

316
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:45,043
Come here,
I want to ask you something.

317
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,380
Hey, wait a minute,
God damn it.

318
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:49,923
You don't walk away from me.
Nick!

319
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:51,467
What the hell is that
on your face?

320
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:55,805
Nicky, you and Michael are
going away in a couple of days.

321
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,225
I was just wondering if I
could use this place to stay.

322
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:00,685
Sure.

323
00:22:00,768 --> 00:22:02,061
I want to pay you both.

324
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,314
And I was thinking-

325
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:05,899
What are you talking about?

326
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:12,613
I would want to pay you,
Nick.

327
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,870
It's me you're talking to.

328
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:18,496
How long have you
known me for?

329
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:23,709
What?

330
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,052
Oh!

331
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:22,959
Have you, Steven,

332
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,626
a free will
and a firm intention

333
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,088
to take unto yourself
as wife, this woman, Angela,

334
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,007
whom you see before you?

335
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,175
I do.

336
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,261
You have not promised yourself
to any other bride?

337
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,095
I have not.

338
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:36,346
Have you, Angela,

339
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:38,141
a free will and
a firm intention,

340
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,935
to take unto yourself
as husband this man, Steven,

341
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,771
whom you see before you?

342
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:43,897
I have.

343

You have not promised yourself
to any other man?

344

I have not.

345
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,949
Blessed is the kingdom

346
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,201
of the Father and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

347
00:24:56,577 --> 00:25:00,872
Now and ever
and unto ages of ages.

348
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:06,253
Amen.

349
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:17,618
Whoo-hoo.

350
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:23,940
Hey!

351
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,369
For a buck,
you get a shooter, a cigar,

352
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:39,788
and a dance with
the beautiful bride.

353
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:42,206
Fuckin' A.

354
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:43,375
Hey, you.

355
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:45,503
And you're on your way.

356

357

363
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:25,357

You nut, you want me to dance?
You want me to dance?

Okay. Sure.

It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.

Look, he did it again,

C'mon, I gotta go get
my gun out of my coat.

You punched me right here.

Why? What happened?

474
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,725
Stan is crazy.

I'm the best man.

490
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:41,687
We're going Airborne,
sir.

491
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:44,023
I hope they send us
where the bullets are flying

492
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:45,607
where the fighting's
the worst, huh?

493
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,068
That's right.

494
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,029
Fuck it.

495
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,740
Fuck it?
What did he say?

496
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:53,742
"Fuck it."
"Fuck it."

497
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:55,284
That's what I thought.

498
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,707
Well,
what's it like over there?

499
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:01,500
Can you tell us anything?

500
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,378
Fuck it.

501
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:07,798
Okay. Fuck it.

502
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:10,677
Fuck him.

503
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,016
Fuck it!

504
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,768
Mike!

505
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:22,605
Hey, hey,
fuck who?

506
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:25,817
Fuck who?

507
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:29,406
Who the hell is he?

508
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,698
Who the fuck knows?

509
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:32,742
He looks like
a fucking hillbilly.

510
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,662
Give him another drink,
Jerry, just the same.

511
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:37,289
Hey, fuck it.

512
00:45:12,554 --> 00:45:13,680
I caught it.

513
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:21,898
Will you marry me?

514
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:24,984
Yeah.

515
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:28,028
You would?

516
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:29,737
Mmm-hmm.

517
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:33,367
What I mean is,
if we get back from..

518
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,496
When we get back.

519
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:39,832
I don't know
what the hell I mean.

520
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,919
What goes through your mind
comes out of your mouth.

521
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:45,129
<i>Angela and Steven!</i>

522
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:50,091
<i>If you don't spill a drop</i>

523
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:53,012
<i>it's good luck for
the rest of your life.</i>

524
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,605
Come on.
Come on!

525
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,573
Hey!

526
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,581
Don't worry about
what Stan says.

527
00:48:18,706 --> 00:48:20,375
Just forget that.
Forget what Stan says.

528
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,334
He's got a big
fucking mouth.

529
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,463
That's enough. Come here. Hey!

530
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:26,631
Give me a crack.

531
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:29,301
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

532
00:48:33,096 --> 00:48:34,847
Great,
that's great.

533
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,060
That's my last
one true secret.

534
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:42,064
It's nothing, it's nothing,
just forget about it.

535
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:44,524
Angela!

536
00:48:48,487 --> 00:48:49,696
Oh, Angela!

537
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:51,699
What am I gonna do
when she has a baby?

538
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:52,909
That's Angela's part,
right?

539
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:55,161
Leave all that to her.
Just hang loose.

540
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:56,370
Hang loose?
Hang loose.

541
00:48:56,495 --> 00:48:58,247
What are you so worried about?
Be happy.

542
00:48:58,372 --> 00:48:59,416
Get out of here.

543
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:00,833
We don't wanna see you
anymore.

544
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,377
Look at this maniac.

545
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:06,256
See you Monday
on the train.

546
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:08,050
Hey!

547
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:11,053
Drive careful.

548
00:49:11,136 --> 00:49:13,223
You didn't know
that about Angela, huh?

549
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:15,265
Right?
That's bullshit, man.

550
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,640
Bullshit?
Bullshit.

551
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:18,266
Yeah? I happen
to know it's true.

552
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,226
That's bullshit.
I happen to know it's true.

553
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:21,396
You're full of bullshit.

554
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,897
All right, you want to bet?
Yeah.

555
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:24,732
Go, put your money
where your mouth is.

556
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:26,609
Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.

557
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:28,152
Eh, grow up.

558
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:34,911
All right!

559
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:50,760
Michael, what are you doing?

560
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:52,428
Hey, Mike!

561
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:54,263
Michael!

562
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,809
Michael, what the hell
are you doing?

563
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,937
Michael!

564
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:04,191
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

565
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:05,444
Michael!

566
00:50:08,028 --> 00:50:09,196
Fuck it!

567
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:10,906
Michael, come back here.

568
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:14,076
What the hell is he doing?

569
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,413
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

570
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:19,416
Michael, come back here,
Michael!

571
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,959
Michael, we love you.
Get back here!

572
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,294
I gotta talk to you!

573
00:50:36,348 --> 00:50:37,309
Mike!

574
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,525
Hey!

575
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:13,679
Shit!

576
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:18,935
I must be out of
my fucking mind.

577
00:51:19,186 --> 00:51:20,771
I must be out of
my mind.

578
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:28,987
I don't know,
everything's going so fast.

579
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:30,739
Man, oh, man!

580
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,243
Hey, Nick.

581
00:51:36,288 --> 00:51:38,247
You think we'll ever
come back?

582
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,539
From Nam?

583
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:40,582
Yeah.

584
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:46,048
You know something?

585
00:51:46,715 --> 00:51:48,050
The whole thing,

586
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:50,969
it's right here.

587
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:53,720
I love
this fucking place.

588
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:57,518
I know that sounds crazy,
but if anything happens, Mike,

589
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:00,062
don't leave-
don't leave me over there.

590
00:52:00,186 --> 00:52:01,564
You got-you gotta..

591
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:02,982
Just don't leave me.

592
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:04,483
You gotta promise me that,
Mike.

593
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,609
Hey!

594
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:11,907
No, man, you got-you gotta-
you gotta promise. Definitely.

595
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:14,743
Hey, Nicky.
Huh?

596
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,246
You got it, pal.

597
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:03,460
<i>"Geronimo!"</i>

Don't push.

612
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,308
Fucking cold.

613
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:02,314
36 beers.

614
00:54:02,565 --> 00:54:03,525
Oh!

615
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:04,524
What?

616
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,527
Come on.

617
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:09,030
All right, I'll go already.
Wait, wait.

618
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:18,414
Did you ever piss and take a
drink of beer at the same time?

619
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:23,878
Oh!

620
00:54:27,466 --> 00:54:29,886
I just barely got
a chance to shake it off.

621
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,261
Wait! Come on!

622
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:32,679
Fuck.

623
00:54:35,598 --> 00:54:36,849

Sons of bitches!

625

You guys
going my way?

626
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:19,520
Come on.

627
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:26,651
Fuck!

628
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:32,742
That's not funny!

629
00:55:52,471 --> 00:55:54,266
Don't fuck
around, now.

630
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:57,894
Come on.
Don't fuck around.

631
00:55:58,018 --> 00:55:59,353
Don't fuck around.

632
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:02,814
Don't fuck around.

633
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:31,678
Let me out!

634
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:33,179
Out, out.
Let me out.

635
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:34,305
Get out.

636
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,189
This is not it!

637
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,856
Definitely.
This is not it.

638
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,190
They changed it.
No kidding.

639
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,108
Somehow,
they changed it.

640
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:47,194
Like this happens
every goddamm year.

641
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:49,364
You're full of shit,
Stanley.

642
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,907
Who did you say
was full of shit?

643
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,369
You're full of shit,
you're always full of shit.

644
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,704
I'm starving.

645
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,038
Eat that.

646
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,040
Nicky, let me
ask you a question.

647
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:00,458
How come I never
see you eating?

648
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,044
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

649
00:57:03,544 --> 00:57:05,088
It ain't natural.

650
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,548
Come on, John.

651
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,674
Hey, it's mine.

652
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:09,009
You really
want it that bad?

653
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,385
You're goddamn right!

654
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,179
Hey, give me a Twinkie,
Mike.

655
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:15,724
What are you guys,
a bunch of cripples? Here.

656
00:57:22,441 --> 00:57:23,524
That's mustard.

657
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,566
What?

658
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,111
He put mustard
on his Twinkie.

659
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,910
You're talking like
a goddamn traffic cop.

660
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:33,369
Incredible.

661
00:57:33,786 --> 00:57:35,914
Come on, give me a beer,
Mike. Come on.

662
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:37,872
I can't believe you guys.

663
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:39,499
What the hell am
I doing with you?

664
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,043
This is not it.

665
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:43,588
They changed it,
somehow they changed it.

666
00:57:44,797 --> 00:57:46,883
You couldn't find your own ass
with two hands.

667
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:47,966
Fuckin' A.

668
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:49,093
Hey, you know.

669
00:57:49,218 --> 00:57:51,929
We forgot to toast
Steven and Angela.

670
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:54,890
Steven and Angela!

671
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,441
What?

672
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,113
Don't make me laugh when
I have things in my mouth.

673
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,947
I can't take you guys
anywhere.

674
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:12,241
What the hell are you doing?

675
00:58:12,324 --> 00:58:13,993
Take your hands off
the fucking bread.

676
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:15,244
You can dress him up,

677
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:17,371
but you can't take
him anywhere.

678
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:19,499
Come on! Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?

679
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:21,584
That was mine,
you assholes.

680
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,134
Fucking assholes.
I can't fucking..

681
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,511
Fuckin' A!

682
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:33,889
You know, Axel,

683
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:35,806
you got a really terrific
vocabulary.

684
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,058
Fuckin' A.

685
00:58:37,141 --> 00:58:38,436
Hey, watch the gear.

686
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,771
Watch the rifle.

687
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,606
Give me my bag.

688
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:45,902
It's getting cold.
Huh?

689
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,949
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

690
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:54,703
Fuckin' A.

691
00:58:56,538 --> 00:58:57,539
Hey, Mike!

692
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,543
You got any
extra thermal socks?

693
00:59:01,878 --> 00:59:03,754
Never mind,
I got them.

694
00:59:04,964 --> 00:59:06,883
Where the hell's my boots?

695
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:11,303
Anybody see my boots?

696
00:59:12,555 --> 00:59:14,181
Somebody took my boots.

697
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:16,017
I bought them special.

698
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:18,477
All right.

699
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:21,398
All right, you guys, whoever
took my boots, I want them back.

700
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:22,983
I got a boot for you, Stan.

701
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:24,900
Right up your ass.

702
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:27,528
Hey, Mike.

703
00:59:30,574 --> 00:59:32,410
Hey, Mike, let me borrow
your spares, huh?

704
00:59:32,576 --> 00:59:33,619
Your extra pair?

705
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:34,911
No, Stan.

706
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:37,288
No?

707
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:40,958
What do you mean, "no?"

708
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:43,004
Just what I said, no.
"No" means no.

709
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:47,633
Some fucking friend, you're some
fucking friend, you know that?

710
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:48,800
You got to learn, Stanley.

711
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:51,637
Every time you come up here you
got your goddamn head up your ass.

712
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,722
Maybe he likes
the view from up there, huh?

713
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,022
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife,

714
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:04,399
he's got no jacket, he's got
no pants, he's got no boots.

715
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:08,155
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries around like John Wayne.

716
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,740
That ain't gonna help you.

717
01:00:09,865 --> 01:00:12,576
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

718
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:14,578
No way.
I ain't giving him no boots.

719
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:16,412
No more, no more,
that's it.

720
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:20,375
You're a fucking bastard,
you know that?

721
01:00:20,793 --> 01:00:22,085
Stanley, you see this?

722
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:24,212
This is this,
this ain't something else.

723
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:26,131
This is this.

724
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:28,508
From now on,
you're on your own.

725
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:34,765
I fixed you up
a million times.

726
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,101
I fixed him up
a million times.

727
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:40,397
I don't know now many times I
must have fixed him up with girls,

728
01:00:40,522 --> 01:00:42,482
and nothing ever happens.
Zero.

729
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:44,316
Hey, you know your trouble,
Mike, huh?

730
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:46,486
Nobody ever knows what the
fuck you're talking about.

731
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:47,821
Huh? "This is this."

732
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,491
What the hell's that supposed
to mean? "This is this."

733
01:00:50,616 --> 01:00:53,285
I mean, is that some faggot-sounding
bullshit, or is that some-

734
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,244
Shut up, Stan, will you?

735
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:56,704
Hey, man,
you're out of line.

736
01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:58,538
Watch out
with that gun, Stan.

737
01:00:58,663 --> 01:00:59,748
Do you know what I think?

738
01:00:59,874 --> 01:01:00,834
You know what I think?

739
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:03,338
There's times I swear, I
think you're a fucking faggot.

740
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:05,130
Hey, come on, you guys.

741
01:01:05,256 --> 01:01:06,966
Last week, last week
he could've had that

742
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:08,927
new red-headed waitress
at the Bowladrome.

743
01:01:09,008 --> 01:01:10,344
He could've had it knocked.

744
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:12,514
Look what he fucking did?
Nothing.

745
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:13,766
That's what.

746
01:01:13,891 --> 01:01:16,601
Shut up, Stan!
Just shut up.

747
01:01:16,727 --> 01:01:17,936
Just shut up.

748
01:01:18,061 --> 01:01:20,937
Take-Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up!

749
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:22,857
Otherwise,
I'm goin' home.

750
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,693
Okay,
I'm going home right now.

751
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:26,152
Get off my stuff.

752
01:01:26,277 --> 01:01:27,780
What the hell are you
doing in there?

753
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:32,159
Hey, Stosh,

754
01:01:33,327 --> 01:01:34,577
I said no.

755
01:01:40,082 --> 01:01:41,875
What, are you gonna
shoot me?

756
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,169
Huh?

757
01:01:43,629 --> 01:01:44,672
Here.

758
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:07,695
What's the matter with you?

759
01:02:09,197 --> 01:02:10,324
Stan.

760
01:05:23,065 --> 01:05:25,150
Watch it, Mike! Watch it.

761
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:32,742
Hey, Steven!

762
01:05:32,993 --> 01:05:35,078
Hey, Angela,
I got a big gun!

763
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:41,961

Stevie, calm down!

Think of something else.

796
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:50,387
Control yourself.
Think of something else.

797
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:58,769
We don't belong here.

798
01:14:15,874 --> 01:14:20,336
Take it easy.
It's gonna be okay.

I'm all right.

Okay. I'm okay.

801
01:14:44,277 --> 01:14:46,112
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

802

It's okay,
it's okay.

803

Take it easy, Stevie.
Stevie, take it easy.

Mike.

Come on.
Come on.

Mike?

812
01:15:59,144 --> 01:16:02,107
Shake it off. Shake it out.
Shake it out.

813
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:04,736
Think of something else.
Think of home.

01:16:53,286 --> 01:16:55,955
They're gonna have
to kill my ass, Mike.

817
01:16:58,459 --> 01:17:00,543
Stevie, you gotta do it.
If you don't do it,

818
01:17:00,627 --> 01:17:02,753
they're gonna
throw you in the pit.

819
01:17:03,129 --> 01:17:05,340
They throw you in the pit,
you're gonna die.

820
01:17:05,465 --> 01:17:07,676
Go ahead, you gotta do it.
You can do it.

821
01:17:08,134 --> 01:17:09,719
You can do it, Stevie.

822
01:17:16,518 --> 01:17:20,355
Look in my eyes. Stevie.
Stevie, look at me!

823
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,440
Mike?

824
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:23,109
Do it! Do it!

825
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:26,280
Go ahead! Show them you got
balls. Show 'em you got balls.

826
01:17:26,403 --> 01:17:28,155
Fuck you.

827
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:30,657
Go ahead!

828
01:17:30,783 --> 01:17:32,535
Shoot me.
Go ahead.

829
01:17:34,287 --> 01:17:35,496
Come on.

830
01:17:41,335 --> 01:17:42,336
Go ahead.

831
01:17:42,461 --> 01:17:45,465
Go ahead, Stevie! Go ahead.
Show them you got balls!

832
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,551
Go ahead!

833
01:18:01,106 --> 01:18:02,358
Hey, kid.

834
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:06,986
Kid. Look at me,
Stevie, you did it.

835
01:18:11,658 --> 01:18:13,787
Stevie,
you showed these bastards.

836
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:16,039
You showed 'em.

837
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:29,763
Don't worry, kid.

838
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,306
You did it.

839
01:18:49,784 --> 01:18:51,035
Michael!

840
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,495
Michael!

841
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:54,621
Stevie!

842
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,131
Michael.

843
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,091
Michael.

844
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:13,556
Stevie!

845
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:15,016
Stevie, don't worry.

846
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:19,395
Mike, help!

847
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:23,860
Oh, God!
There's rats in here!

848
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:45,799
Nicky.

849
01:19:54,726 --> 01:19:56,185
Motherfucker!

850
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,438
Motherfucker!

851
01:20:00,023 --> 01:20:01,315
Nicky, listen.

852
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:08,949
It's up to us now.
It's me and you.

853
01:20:10,034 --> 01:20:11,661
What about Steven?

854
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,995
Forget him.

855
01:20:13,161 --> 01:20:14,204
Forget him?

856
01:20:14,329 --> 01:20:16,458
Forget him.
He ain't gonna make it.

857
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,375
Who do you think you are?
God?

858
01:20:22,086 --> 01:20:23,962
Look at him, he's in a daze.

859
01:20:25,341 --> 01:20:27,593
He ain't coming out,
he's in a dream.

860
01:20:27,676 --> 01:20:28,969
Mike,
what are you saying?

861
01:20:29,053 --> 01:20:30,347
I'm saying forget him, Nick.

862
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:32,847
Get it through your head, or
you and me are both gone, too.

863
01:20:42,525 --> 01:20:44,068
Gotta play with
more bullets.

864
01:20:44,194 --> 01:20:45,193
What?

865
01:20:45,318 --> 01:20:46,695
More bullets.

866
01:20:48,864 --> 01:20:51,159
I gotta get more
bullets in the gun.

867
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,579
What?

868
01:20:53,704 --> 01:20:55,163
We got to play
with more bullets.

869
01:20:55,288 --> 01:20:57,166
More bullets in the gun?

870
01:20:57,374 --> 01:20:59,085
How many more bullets?

871
01:21:00,211 --> 01:21:01,128
Three.

872
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:12,807
That means we've got
to play each other.

873
01:21:13,223 --> 01:21:14,558
More bullets
against each other?

874
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:15,767
What, are you crazy?

875
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:17,770
Nicky, it's the only way.

876
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:23,193
I'll pick the moment.

877
01:21:23,277 --> 01:21:25,027
The game goes until I move.

878
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:27,612
When I start shooting,
you go for the nearest guard

879
01:21:27,738 --> 01:21:29,574
you get his gun
and zap the fucker.

880
01:21:29,657 --> 01:21:31,450
I'm not ready for this.

881
01:21:31,575 --> 01:21:33,202
You gotta listen to me.

882
01:21:33,327 --> 01:21:34,956
You want to stay down here
and die?

883
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:37,541
Go.

884
01:21:37,624 --> 01:21:40,210
It's up to you.
Now, it's up to you.

885
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:41,378
No!

886
01:21:41,503 --> 01:21:43,714
Hey, him against me!

887
01:21:43,797 --> 01:21:44,757
Side by side.

888
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:49,553
Get away! Get away!

889
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,220
Side by side.

890
01:21:51,387 --> 01:21:52,806
Man, I can't wait!

891
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,893
Michael!

892
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:57,686
Michael!

893
01:22:36,476 --> 01:22:37,646
Come on!

894
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:41,231
These fuckers, these fuckers.
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

895
01:22:41,315 --> 01:22:43,611
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

896
01:22:43,694 --> 01:22:46,362
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead,
Nicky. That's it. That's it.

897
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:05,675
I do three bullets.
Three, three.

898
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,678
We do three, huh?
One, two, three. Three.

899
01:23:19,605 --> 01:23:21,191
Three, three.

900
01:23:27,072 --> 01:23:29,657
Three, three.

901
01:23:31,994 --> 01:23:33,913
Don't worry, Nick.
Don't worry.

902
01:23:34,037 --> 01:23:36,208
In five minutes,
we're gonna be out of here.

903
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,374
We're gonna be out of here.

904
01:23:48,886 --> 01:23:52,138
Now we got ourselves a game.
You and me. You and me.

905
01:24:14,956 --> 01:24:18,167
Okay. Okay, you want a game?

906
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:36,225
Go ahead.

907
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:37,353
No more.

908
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:38,813
No, no more.

909
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:43,526
That's fucked.

910
01:24:43,608 --> 01:24:45,527
I'm gonna will us
outta here.

911
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,738
You've got an empty
chamber in that gun.

912
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:50,326
Put an empty chamber
in that gun. Go ahead.

913
01:24:58,915 --> 01:25:00,085
God damn it!

914
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,586
It's gonna be all right,
Nicky.

915
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:04,130
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot, Nicky!

916
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,134
You motherfucker!

917
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,056
No, no, no, Nicky!

918
01:25:16,228 --> 01:25:18,480
Now you're gonna die,
you motherfucker!

919
01:25:18,604 --> 01:25:20,607
You're gonna die!

920
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:24,402
Go ahead, go ahead, Nicky,
just do it.

921
01:25:24,944 --> 01:25:26,697
Do it, do it, do it.

922
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:28,156
Go ahead.

923
01:25:34,998 --> 01:25:36,332
You made it.

924
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,341
It's all right.

925
01:25:43,466 --> 01:25:45,258
All right,
we're gonna show them.

926
01:25:55,353 --> 01:25:56,395
All right.

927
01:25:58,021 --> 01:25:58,896
All right.

928
01:26:19,626 --> 01:26:20,544
Yeah.

929
01:26:37,564 --> 01:26:39,189
Come on, come on.

930
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:41,317
Come on.

931
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:42,859
Nicky.

932
01:26:44,484 --> 01:26:45,611
Nicky.

933
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:48,241
Come on, damn it!
Come on.

934
01:26:54,246 --> 01:26:55,622
Oh, shit.

935
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:00,252
Get me up.

936
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:04,174
Steve!

937
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:11,889
Get on it. Get on it.

938
01:27:16,102 --> 01:27:18,063
Michael, Michael.

939
01:27:20,107 --> 01:27:21,317
Michael!

940
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:28,072
Stevie, come on.

941
01:27:28,198 --> 01:27:31,285
Come on, Stevie. We're gonna
go for a swim. Come on, Stevie.

942
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,955
Come on, come on.

943
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:40,044
We don't belong here
in the jungle, Michael.

944
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:46,717
Just get on, see?
Just get on.

945
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:48,969
There's rats
in these waters.

946
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:54,100
Hold on, right there.

947
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,145
Hold on.

948
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:13,745
Michael.

949
01:28:13,828 --> 01:28:14,535
Okay, buddy.

950
01:28:21,002 --> 01:28:22,088
Mike.

951
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,762
Nicky.

952
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:58,000
Mike, I want to go home, Mike.

953
01:30:01,983 --> 01:30:03,442
What is that?

954
01:30:05,278 --> 01:30:07,324
What's that sound, Michael?

955
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:21,878
Hey! Hey! Hey!

956
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:35,455
Go on! Go on!

957
01:31:35,538 --> 01:31:39,416
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, Michael.

958
01:31:43,215 --> 01:31:44,549
Mike!

959
01:32:30,347 --> 01:32:31,263
Steve!

960
01:32:55,456 --> 01:32:59,253
I hit some rocks, Michael.
I hit some rocks.

961
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:01,255
On my legs, Michael.

962
01:33:01,421 --> 01:33:03,966
Okay. Relax.

963
01:33:06,634 --> 01:33:08,552
Come on, come on.

964
01:33:09,511 --> 01:33:12,266
Stevie, come on.

965
01:33:12,391 --> 01:33:14,101
Come on, Stevie.

966
01:33:14,185 --> 01:33:15,603
Please.

967
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:20,607
My legs.

968
01:33:21,066 --> 01:33:22,401
I hit some rocks.

969
01:33:24,235 --> 01:33:25,403
Okay. All right.

970
01:33:33,663 --> 01:33:34,664
That's it.

971
01:33:34,788 --> 01:33:35,956
My arm.

972
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:38,752
Okay.

973
01:33:38,835 --> 01:33:40,837
I can't feel my legs.

974
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,925
All right, all right,
come on.

975
01:33:47,509 --> 01:33:48,802
My arm.

976
01:33:53,933 --> 01:33:55,436
Push yourself.

977
01:34:04,528 --> 01:34:05,446
Whoa.

978
01:34:12,202 --> 01:34:14,705
Oh, man.

979
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:18,376
Okay, kid, okay, shh, shh.

980
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:37,292
Take him.

981
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:39,335
Take him.

982
01:35:49,055 --> 01:35:50,471
Not me, him.

983
01:38:05,197 --> 01:38:07,574
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

984
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:12,411
Can you understand me,

Yes.

Uh-huh, Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

988
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:29,889
No. It's American.

989
01:38:31,348 --> 01:38:33,475
All right,
let me see your name tag.

990
01:38:35,561 --> 01:38:36,770
Is this yours?

991
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:39,606
It's his.

992
01:38:40,065 --> 01:38:42,025
What are your
parents' names?

993

Lou.

994

And what are your
parents' dates of birth?

997
01:39:42,463 --> 01:39:44,841
We're gonna have
to get him out of here.

998
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,333
Sure, sure, sure.

1000
01:40:18,794 --> 01:40:20,086
Excuse me.

1001

1002
01:40:26,426 --> 01:40:27,552

01:57:14,311 --> 01:57:15,312
No.

1149
01:57:16,772 --> 01:57:17,732
No.

1150
01:57:26,156 --> 01:57:28,035
Did you hear
anything on Nick?

1151
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:32,039
No.

1152
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:38,504
Nothing. He's AWOL.
That's all we know.

1153
01:57:42,592 --> 01:57:44,051
He'll be back.

1154
01:57:45,178 --> 01:57:47,887
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

1155
01:57:48,513 --> 01:57:50,099
Well, maybe you were out.

1156
01:57:52,058 --> 01:57:54,020
Yeah, maybe.

1157
01:57:59,568 --> 01:58:01,191
So how are you, anyway?

1158
01:58:02,526 --> 01:58:04,822
I'm fine, okay.
How are you?

1159
01:58:05,031 --> 01:58:09,243
Uh, me? I'm okay. I'm fine.
I go along, you know.

1160
01:58:10,161 --> 01:58:12,037
Still working at the market.

1161
01:58:13,705 --> 01:58:15,791
There's a million
things to do.

1162
01:58:17,209 --> 01:58:18,543
Y- You sure you're all right,
huh?

1163
01:58:18,627 --> 01:58:19,587
Yeah, I'm all right.

1164
01:58:19,713 --> 01:58:21,548
What about your wounds?

1165
01:58:21,966 --> 01:58:23,550
There's nothing.

1166
01:58:24,427 --> 01:58:26,636
Just the usual complications,
that's all.

1167
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:27,970
We heard-

1168
01:58:28,054 --> 01:58:30,683
No, that's not true.
A lot of guys go through it.

1169
01:58:30,849 --> 01:58:31,767
Mmm.

1170
01:58:35,103 --> 01:58:37,273
I made Nick that sweater.

1171
01:58:44,447 --> 01:58:46,949
I couldn't remember
the exact size,

1172
01:58:47,659 --> 01:58:50,579
but I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

1173
01:58:54,248 --> 01:58:57,002
No, too big. Oops.

1174
01:58:58,963 --> 01:59:01,048
Well,
I could fix that, though.

1175
01:59:02,384 --> 01:59:05,052
I mean, one thing about wool,
it's really a cinch..

1176
01:59:08,346 --> 01:59:09,555
to fix.

1177
01:59:11,891 --> 01:59:13,061
Oh, Christ!

1178
01:59:15,646 --> 01:59:16,647
It's okay.

1179
01:59:17,815 --> 01:59:19,026
It's okay.

1180
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:24,780
It's okay.

1181
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:27,868
How's your job?

1182
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:30,202
Great. Fine, yeah.

1183
01:59:31,413 --> 01:59:33,164
Once or twice we
almost had to close.

1184
01:59:33,288 --> 01:59:34,875
I gotta go to work now.

1185
01:59:36,751 --> 01:59:37,918
You gotta go now?

1186
01:59:38,044 --> 01:59:39,212
Yes.

1187
01:59:39,338 --> 01:59:41,632
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

1188
01:59:45,844 --> 01:59:47,596
Mikey, you're so..

1189
01:59:48,638 --> 01:59:49,639
weird.

1190
01:59:50,849 --> 01:59:52,809
You're always
such a gentleman.

1191
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:02,944
It's cold out there.

1192
02:00:03,027 --> 02:00:03,987
Yeah.

1193
02:00:04,071 --> 02:00:05,281
I'm not used to it.

1194
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,786
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

1195
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:11,413
I'm so happy.

1196
02:00:14,497 --> 02:00:16,834
I really don't know
what I feel.

1197
02:00:47,575 --> 02:00:49,120
Hello, hi, Mike.

1198
02:01:10,226 --> 02:01:14,730
Linda, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Nick.

1199
02:01:14,979 --> 02:01:17,022
And how..

1200
02:01:17,941 --> 02:01:19,858
I know how much
you loved him,

1201
02:01:19,941 --> 02:01:22,653
and I know that
it'll never be the same.

1202
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:26,657
I just wanted
to tell you that.

1203
02:01:27,451 --> 02:01:29,201
Maybe..
I don't know.

1204
02:01:29,285 --> 02:01:31,538
Maybe you don't want
to talk about it.

1205
02:01:47,262 --> 02:01:48,971
How's it going, Hot Lips?

1206
02:01:51,559 --> 02:01:54,479
Yeah, no kidding.
He's a real tough guy.

1207
02:01:56,689 --> 02:01:58,023
It's okay.

1208
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:05,031
Why don't you
come in with me?

1209
02:02:05,115 --> 02:02:08,035
Just say hello.
Come on. Oh, Mike, please.

1210
02:02:08,118 --> 02:02:10,120
Just say hello.
They want to see you, I know.

1211
02:02:10,245 --> 02:02:12,538
Yeah, just for a second,
okay? Okay.

1212
02:02:12,747 --> 02:02:14,248
Hey, look who's here?

1213
02:02:14,332 --> 02:02:15,375
It's Michael!

1214
02:02:15,459 --> 02:02:17,335
Look who's here.
Hey, everybody.

1215
02:02:18,755 --> 02:02:22,300
Oh, Michael, I read about
you in the paper. Oh, Michael.

1216
02:02:22,425 --> 02:02:24,136
Oh, Michael.
Oh, dear.

1217
02:02:24,303 --> 02:02:25,678
Doesn't he look terrific?

1218
02:02:25,802 --> 02:02:28,263
What a nice coat you have.
Hi, Michael.

1219
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:29,807
Mike.
How beautiful you look.

1220
02:02:29,931 --> 02:02:31,308
You look good, Mike.

1221
02:02:31,391 --> 02:02:32,350
Welcome back.

1222
02:02:32,475 --> 02:02:33,477
Doesn't he
look gorgeous?

1223
02:02:33,602 --> 02:02:34,646
I'm glad he's home.

1224
02:02:34,771 --> 02:02:36,772
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this. Medals.

1225
02:02:36,857 --> 02:02:38,107
Oh, my god.

1226
02:02:38,232 --> 02:02:39,524
All the medals.

1227
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:40,859
Congratulations.

1228
02:02:40,984 --> 02:02:42,403
Oh, Michael.

1229
02:02:42,486 --> 02:02:43,695
Oh, Helen, come on.

1230
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:45,157
Janie, leave me alone.

1231
02:02:47,158 --> 02:02:50,079
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1232
02:02:50,163 --> 02:02:51,956
I have to go to work now.

1233
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,875
Good seein' you, Mike.

1234
02:02:55,251 --> 02:02:56,710
See you, Michael.

1235
02:02:56,919 --> 02:02:59,381
Come see us, Michael.

1236
02:03:01,715 --> 02:03:02,883
Can I see you later?

1237
02:03:03,008 --> 02:03:04,175
Okay.

1238
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:05,385
After work?

1239
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:06,512
Yeah. Where?
Where.

1240
02:03:06,637 --> 02:03:08,179
At home?
At home? Okay.

1241
02:03:39,255 --> 02:03:40,589
One beer at John's. One beer.

1242
02:03:40,715 --> 02:03:41,923
What?

1243
02:03:42,048 --> 02:03:43,967
Come on,
I'll buy you a beer.

1244
02:03:45,092 --> 02:03:46,261
All right, just one.

1245
02:03:46,385 --> 02:03:48,848
Hey, Axel! Hey, Stosh!
Hey, Axel.

1246
02:03:49,514 --> 02:03:50,640
Hey!

1247
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:52,309
Hey! He-hey!
Look at this!

1248
02:03:52,392 --> 02:03:53,686
How you doing?

1249
02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:55,729
Mikey! Hey, man, how
are you doing? All right.

1250
02:03:55,813 --> 02:03:57,648
Hey, where was you?
Where was you?

1251
02:03:57,731 --> 02:03:59,817
What do you mean, where
was I? Where were you?

1252
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:01,945
Where was you, when we had
everything all set there.

1253
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:04,281
The beer..
I'm I right, Axel? Huh?

1254
02:04:04,406 --> 02:04:05,866
I got delayed.

1255
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,951
Something..

1256
02:04:08,076 --> 02:04:08,994
Hey.

1257
02:04:10,578 --> 02:04:12,038
You got a mustache.

1258
02:04:12,955 --> 02:04:14,124
Yeah.

1259
02:04:14,249 --> 02:04:15,960
Hey, it looks pretty good.

1260
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,087
It's cute.

1261
02:04:18,212 --> 02:04:19,338
Yeah, it looks..

1262
02:04:19,422 --> 02:04:21,424
Come on,
we're going to John's.

1263
02:04:23,176 --> 02:04:25,051
So, how have you guys been?

1264
02:04:27,347 --> 02:04:28,722
Hanging in there. You know?

1265
02:04:28,805 --> 02:04:30,893
How does it feel
to be shot?

1266
02:04:30,976 --> 02:04:32,269
It don't.

1267
02:04:32,685 --> 02:04:33,646
Mmm.

1268
02:04:34,145 --> 02:04:37,107
It don't hurt, if that's what
you want to know.

1269
02:04:37,776 --> 02:04:40,109
How you been? Been okay?

1270
02:04:40,610 --> 02:04:41,737
Yeah.
Yeah.

1271
02:04:42,487 --> 02:04:43,905
Same old thing, you know?

1272
02:04:43,989 --> 02:04:45,782
Nothing's changed.

1273
02:04:46,032 --> 02:04:47,951
I'm getting more ass
than a toilet seat

1274
02:04:48,035 --> 02:04:50,202
and Axel here,
he's getting fatter than ever.

1275
02:04:54,081 --> 02:04:56,250
Hey, Stan, why don't you
show him that gun?

1276
02:04:56,376 --> 02:04:58,294
Shh. Take it easy.

1277
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,672
That little pussy thing you
carry around, look at that.

1278
02:05:00,798 --> 02:05:01,758
Watch it.

1279
02:05:01,883 --> 02:05:03,217
What's that for?

1280
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,634
Same thing
the other one was for.

1281
02:05:04,759 --> 02:05:05,843
And what was that for?

1282
02:05:05,969 --> 02:05:07,554
He's a worrier.

1283
02:05:07,637 --> 02:05:09,931
Ah, forget it. Come on,
let's go have a drink.

1284
02:05:10,015 --> 02:05:11,475
Yeah, let's get a drink.

1285
02:05:13,728 --> 02:05:16,437
Hey, Boom-Boom!
Look what I found!

1286
02:05:16,646 --> 02:05:19,566
Hey, Michael!
Never seen somebody..

1287
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:21,861
Let this man through.
A little room!

1288
02:05:21,986 --> 02:05:23,531
How you doing, Mike?

1289
02:05:24,991 --> 02:05:26,367
What's up, buddy?

1290
02:05:29,161 --> 02:05:33,081
<i>"But she never complains of the fast
times and the bad things he's done"</i>

1291
02:05:33,206 --> 02:05:35,417
Come on, come on,
in the back, in the back.

1292
02:05:37,003 --> 02:05:38,253
Get in the back.

1293
02:05:38,336 --> 02:05:39,505
Come on.

1294
02:05:39,672 --> 02:05:41,464
<i>"She just talks about
the good times they've had"</i>

1295
02:05:41,673 --> 02:05:43,675
<i>"and all the good times
to come"</i>

1296
02:05:43,843 --> 02:05:45,553
Hey, what's going on here?

1297
02:05:47,596 --> 02:05:49,348
Stosh,
get the glasses on the sink.

1298
02:05:49,473 --> 02:05:51,099
Which ones, the dirty ones?

1299
02:05:51,266 --> 02:05:52,893
Yeah, use the dirty ones.

1300
02:05:53,436 --> 02:05:54,730
Phew, no shit.

1301
02:05:55,689 --> 02:05:57,940
Shit, what did you do?
Win the war all by yourself?

1302
02:05:59,066 --> 02:06:00,276
Look at this stuff here.

1303
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,486
No help from you.

1304
02:06:01,610 --> 02:06:03,112
Here we go!

1305
02:06:03,196 --> 02:06:04,197
<i>Misha..</i>

1306
02:06:07,869 --> 02:06:08,994
To you, Mike.

1307
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:10,328
To everybody.

1469
02:21:14,897 --> 02:21:16,150
What, you think
it was loaded?

1470
02:21:16,275 --> 02:21:17,442
Give me that!

1471
02:21:31,665 --> 02:21:33,125
You want to play games?

1472
02:21:33,250 --> 02:21:35,710
All right,
I'll play your fucking games!

1473
02:21:39,672 --> 02:21:40,548
Hey!

1474
02:21:40,673 --> 02:21:43,678
How do you feel now? Huh? Huh?

1475
02:21:44,678 --> 02:21:45,679
Hey!

1476
02:21:45,762 --> 02:21:46,889
Big shot!

1477
02:23:11,184 --> 02:23:12,604
Hi, Michael.

1478
02:23:12,853 --> 02:23:13,855
Linda's in back.

1479
02:23:13,939 --> 02:23:14,939
She's in back?

1480
02:23:15,023 --> 02:23:16,274
Yeah, hey,
how was the hunting?

1481
02:23:16,398 --> 02:23:17,776
It was fine, thanks.

1482
02:23:29,789 --> 02:23:31,748
Linda, what's the matter?

1483
02:23:36,628 --> 02:23:38,046
I don't know.

1484
02:23:40,382 --> 02:23:42,049
What's the matter?

1485
02:23:42,843 --> 02:23:44,679
Nothing, I don't know.

1486
02:23:50,307 --> 02:23:52,310
Well,
it's gotta be something.

1487
02:23:55,690 --> 02:23:57,526
I got the car outside.

1488
02:23:57,734 --> 02:23:59,487
Yeah. Well, that's okay.

1489
02:24:02,238 --> 02:24:03,280
You sure?

1490
02:24:03,364 --> 02:24:05,826
No, it's okay.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1491
02:24:07,870 --> 02:24:08,996
Really.

1492
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:29,934
Good night,
see you in the morning.

1493
02:24:30,017 --> 02:24:31,936
Good night, see you tomorrow.

1494
02:24:35,814 --> 02:24:38,025
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1495
02:24:41,486 --> 02:24:43,363
No, I think
I'll go with him.

1496
02:24:43,447 --> 02:24:45,157
Okay? Thanks.
Okay.

1497
02:24:54,958 --> 02:24:56,377
You okay?

1498
02:25:00,215 --> 02:25:02,927
Did you ever think life
would turn out like this?

1499
02:25:06,097 --> 02:25:07,138
No.

1500
02:27:40,299 --> 02:27:42,135
<i>I-27.</i>

1501
02:27:45,222 --> 02:27:46,388
<i>N-40.</i>

1502
02:27:46,514 --> 02:27:47,599
Bingo.

1503
02:27:48,099 --> 02:27:51,393
<i>We have a bingo,
Johnny come lately.</i>

1504
02:27:52,229 --> 02:27:54,190
<i>Where are you, Johnny?</i>

1505
02:27:54,274 --> 02:27:55,858
<i>There you are.</i>

1506
02:27:55,941 --> 02:27:57,192
B-15.

1507
02:27:57,275 --> 02:27:58,817
<i>Yeah.

1508
02:27:58,942 --> 02:28:00,569
<i>Right.

1509
02:28:00,737 --> 02:28:01,654
<i>Right.</i>

<i>G-60.</i>

1511
02:28:02,905 --> 02:28:05,407
<i>We have.. That's a winner.</i>

1512
02:28:05,574 --> 02:28:06,993
<i>Get out of my road there.</i>

1513
02:28:07,076 --> 02:28:10,205
<i>Ivan Stivan,
I can't see myself smokin'.</i>

1514

<i>And the next number, I-16.</i>

1515
02:28:13,624 --> 02:28:16,795
<i>Wish it was I,
nice, sweet 16.</i>

1516
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:20,132
<i>I-18. Then you become a man.</i>

1517
02:28:20,425 --> 02:28:23,219
<i>Let's go, men, G-60.</i>

1518
02:28:23,344 --> 02:28:25,846
<i>And those boys that
can't help themselves,</i>

1519
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:27,848
<i>please, buddy, help them, too.</i>

1520
02:28:27,931 --> 02:28:30,101
<i>Oh, will you dance with me?</i>

1521
02:28:30,476 --> 02:28:32,395
<i>G-47.</i>

1522
02:28:33,312 --> 02:28:36,900
<i>But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got.</i>

1523
02:28:37,484 --> 02:28:39,778
<i>That wonderful life
I've lived.</i>

1524
02:28:39,903 --> 02:28:44,323
<i>Think it over, buddy boys,
and I'll give you O-61.</i>

1525
02:28:50,499 --> 02:28:52,082
Hi, how're you doing?

1526
02:28:56,254 --> 02:28:58,255
Steven,
there's a call for you.

1527
02:28:59,050 --> 02:29:00,926
Maybe it's from Angela.

1528
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:30,372
Hello.

1529
02:29:30,539 --> 02:29:32,082
<i>Stevie, it's me, Mike.</i>

1530
02:29:32,458 --> 02:29:33,626
Michael?

1531
02:29:35,836 --> 02:29:36,795
Michael?

1532
02:29:37,379 --> 02:29:38,380
Hey.

1533
02:29:38,506 --> 02:29:39,799
<i>Hey.</i>

1534
02:29:41,301 --> 02:29:42,219
Hey.

1535
02:29:43,304 --> 02:29:44,720
How's things?

1536
02:29:44,845 --> 02:29:47,139
<i>I'm okay. Never mind me.
How are you?</i>

1537
02:29:48,849 --> 02:29:50,016
Great.

1538
02:29:51,351 --> 02:29:52,352
Great.

1539
02:29:54,982 --> 02:29:57,234
Hey, wha-
hey, what's that noise?

1540
02:29:58,025 --> 02:29:59,110
What?

1541
02:29:59,402 --> 02:30:01,363
Oh, wheelchairs.

1542
02:30:02,071 --> 02:30:03,155
<i>What?</i>

1543
02:30:07,621 --> 02:30:09,330
Hey, Stevie,
when are you gettin' out?

1544
02:30:10,372 --> 02:30:13,290
Uh, I'm gonna stay
here awhile, Mike.

1545
02:30:13,832 --> 02:30:15,002
What for?

1546
02:30:15,211 --> 02:30:16,503
<i>The place is great.</i>

1547
02:30:16,712 --> 02:30:17,671
Huh?

1548
02:30:18,214 --> 02:30:19,882
It's like a resort.

1549
02:30:21,717 --> 02:30:23,928
I mean, they got basketball,

1550
02:30:24,176 --> 02:30:25,136
bowlin'.

1551
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:26,306
<i>What?</i>

1552
02:30:28,223 --> 02:30:31,144
Princess Grace came to see us
the other day.

1553
02:30:33,147 --> 02:30:34,355
Michael?

1554
02:30:34,439 --> 02:30:35,606
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

1555
02:30:35,815 --> 02:30:36,776
Hey.

1556
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:38,360
<i>Michael.</i>

<i>Steve?</i>

1558
02:30:41,238 --> 02:30:42,407
<i>Stevie.</i>

1559
02:30:42,531 --> 02:30:44,408
Hey, I gotta go, Mike.

1560
02:30:44,658 --> 02:30:45,742
I gotta go.

1561
02:30:46,326 --> 02:30:47,244
<i>Curfew, man.</i>

1562
02:30:48,413 --> 02:30:50,206
Stevie? Steve?

1563
02:31:56,982 --> 02:31:58,401
Mike?

1564
02:32:00,654 --> 02:32:02,447
Mike. Hey.

1565
02:32:05,659 --> 02:32:07,370
Mike, how are you?

1566
02:32:07,745 --> 02:32:08,620
Hey.

1567
02:32:08,746 --> 02:32:09,706
Hey.

1568
02:32:10,497 --> 02:32:11,499
Michael.

1569
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Hey.

1570
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:18,507
Good. We made it.
We made it.

1571
02:32:18,883 --> 02:32:19,842
Okay.
Yeah.

1572
02:32:19,925 --> 02:32:21,510
Good.
That's it.

1573
02:32:21,635 --> 02:32:22,594
Hey.

1574
02:32:23,635 --> 02:32:25,346
I don't wanna go home.

1575
02:32:25,512 --> 02:32:26,347
I know.

1576
02:32:26,513 --> 02:32:27,933
Oh, good. Good.
I know.

1577
02:32:28,058 --> 02:32:29,017
Yeah, good.

1578
02:32:29,142 --> 02:32:30,017
I know.

1579
02:32:30,143 --> 02:32:31,310
Really.

1580
02:32:33,896 --> 02:32:35,106
You look good.

1581
02:32:35,189 --> 02:32:36,233
Yeah.

1582
02:32:36,565 --> 02:32:38,317
You do any hunting?

1583
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:41,320
Hunting? Yeah, I did hunting.
Did you get one?

1584
02:32:41,446 --> 02:32:42,948
No, yeah, no, no.

1585
02:32:43,032 --> 02:32:44,658
You didn't get a deer?

1586
02:32:44,783 --> 02:32:47,035
Didn't get anything.
No, I know.

1587
02:32:47,161 --> 02:32:48,038
Oh.

1588
02:32:48,163 --> 02:32:49,830
I was tracking
this beautiful buck

1589
02:32:49,955 --> 02:32:51,457
and it slipped away.

1590
02:32:51,541 --> 02:32:52,541
Oh.

1591
02:32:53,292 --> 02:32:54,252
Oh.

1592
02:32:54,545 --> 02:32:56,046
Angela didn't send you?

1593
02:32:56,170 --> 02:32:57,047
Angela?

1594
02:32:57,171 --> 02:32:58,131
She didn't send you here?

1595
02:32:58,255 --> 02:32:59,133
No.

1596
02:32:59,758 --> 02:33:01,218
Yeah, good.

1597
02:33:01,302 --> 02:33:02,636
I got something
I wanna show you.

1598
02:33:02,717 --> 02:33:03,635
What's that?

1599
02:33:03,719 --> 02:33:05,222
I got something here.

1600
02:33:06,222 --> 02:33:07,682
Come here with me
for a minute.

1601
02:33:07,807 --> 02:33:09,769
It's something
I gotta show you.

1602
02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:11,061
Yeah.

1603
02:33:12,312 --> 02:33:14,816
Angela, she keeps
sending me socks.

1604
02:33:15,941 --> 02:33:18,318
It's not socks
I gotta show you, Mike.

1605
02:33:19,402 --> 02:33:22,156
This-This comes
every month from Saigon.

1606
02:33:22,239 --> 02:33:23,699
I don't understand.

1607
02:33:24,324 --> 02:33:25,576
I don't understand.

1608
02:33:25,702 --> 02:33:27,994
That place is
gonna fall any day now.

1609
02:33:32,582 --> 02:33:34,209
It's Nicky, Steve.

1610
02:33:35,335 --> 02:33:36,755
Nick's alive?

1611
02:33:38,422 --> 02:33:40,425
Mike? Hey.

1612
02:33:41,842 --> 02:33:43,261
What did you say?

1613
02:33:43,386 --> 02:33:44,721
How do you know?

1614
02:33:47,181 --> 02:33:48,140
Hey.

1615
02:33:48,307 --> 02:33:49,767
That place is
gonna get caught

1616
02:33:49,851 --> 02:33:51,519
in a terrible shitstorm.

1617
02:33:52,062 --> 02:33:54,731
Where's a guy like Nick
get money like this?

1618
02:33:56,232 --> 02:33:57,859
I don't know. Cards, maybe.

1619
02:33:57,943 --> 02:34:00,613
Listen, Steven,
I'm gonna take you home.

1620
02:34:00,737 --> 02:34:02,406
Oh, shit, Mike,
you promised me.

1621
02:34:02,489 --> 02:34:03,741
Stevie, I'm gonna
take you home.

1622
02:34:03,866 --> 02:34:06,577
Come on. I don't fit.. You
can't stay here, come on.

1623
02:34:06,703 --> 02:34:08,079
Look.. Hey.

1624
02:34:08,163 --> 02:34:09,538
I'm gonna take you home.

1625
02:34:09,622 --> 02:34:10,706
Fuck, man.
Look, you promised me, man.

1626
02:34:12,457 --> 02:34:14,585
I don't fit! Michael!

1627
02:34:14,836 --> 02:34:17,422
Hey, I'm sorry.

1628
02:34:17,672 --> 02:34:19,800
You do as your
heart tells you, man.

1629
02:34:52,666 --> 02:34:54,585
We got a Coke machine,
if anybody wants one.

1630
02:34:54,668 --> 02:34:56,753
No, Sergeant,
we're runnin' late.

1631
02:35:01,926 --> 02:35:03,053
Make way!

1632
02:35:07,015 --> 02:35:08,015
Make way!

1633
02:35:15,021 --> 02:35:15,981
Make way!

1634
02:37:06,722 --> 02:37:08,767
Hey, where are you going?

1635
02:37:08,851 --> 02:37:10,728
Are you going to come
with me?

1636
02:38:19,090 --> 02:38:20,340
Do you remember me?

1637
02:38:21,843 --> 02:38:23,177
You remember me?

1638
02:38:27,058 --> 02:38:29,518
You remember Nick?
You remember Nick?

1639
02:38:31,812 --> 02:38:32,855
Where is he?

1640
02:38:33,023 --> 02:38:35,941
I don't know.
Really, I don't know.

1641
02:38:36,065 --> 02:38:37,901
He disappeared
a long time ago.

1642
02:38:40,696 --> 02:38:41,655
Hold on a minute.

1643
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:43,032
What are you
looking for?

1644
02:38:43,157 --> 02:38:44,784
Nothing to see
anymore here.

1645
02:38:44,909 --> 02:38:45,784
See that?

1646
02:38:45,910 --> 02:38:46,867
What you want?

1647
02:38:46,951 --> 02:38:47,954
I want a game.

1648
02:38:49,247 --> 02:38:50,789
That's for you.

1649
02:38:53,167 --> 02:38:54,712
It's too dangerous now.

1650
02:38:54,836 --> 02:38:58,131
These times are too dangerous
for this kind of game.

1651
02:39:00,050 --> 02:39:02,718
What do you think?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1652
02:39:05,263 --> 02:39:07,181
I want to play the American.

1653
02:39:07,764 --> 02:39:09,936
I'll match him.
Highest stakes.

1654
02:39:20,321 --> 02:39:21,405
Okay.

1655
02:39:23,033 --> 02:39:25,202
How do I know
you know where he is?

1656
02:39:25,619 --> 02:39:27,744
Because I know, that's all.

1657
02:39:27,953 --> 02:39:30,206
But I have to take you
by the river.

1658
02:39:43,845 --> 02:39:47,058
Only because I feel
comfortable with the whites.

1659
02:40:48,579 --> 02:40:49,622
We are.

1660
02:40:49,748 --> 02:40:52,209
You like change your mind?
There's still time.

1661
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:15,607
Come on.

1662
02:41:27,994 --> 02:41:29,245
Wait here.

1663
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:55,400
He said we have
to pay to go inside.

1664
02:41:55,525 --> 02:41:56,442
How much?

1665
02:41:56,609 --> 02:41:57,485
$1,000.

1666
02:41:58,277 --> 02:41:59,779
Tell him I'm coming up.

1667
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:36,651
He said, yes, the famous
American is inside.

1668
02:42:36,776 --> 02:42:39,820
You have to give him $500 more
for this information.

1669
02:44:22,011 --> 02:44:23,512
Where's Nick?
I don't know.

1670
02:44:23,638 --> 02:44:25,221
What do you mean?
Where is he?

1671
02:44:25,346 --> 02:44:26,934
We have to go ask the boss.

1672
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:40,238
Hey, Nick.

1673
02:44:41,364 --> 02:44:42,616
Are you all right?

1674
02:44:42,783 --> 02:44:44,074
Nick, it's me.

1675
02:44:45,367 --> 02:44:47,579
Nick. Hey. Hey.

1676
02:44:48,915 --> 02:44:51,749
What you're doing? Nick?
What you're.. Oh.

1677
02:44:51,833 --> 02:44:53,252
What you're doing?

1678
02:44:53,336 --> 02:44:55,463
Nicholas, what's the matter?

1679
02:44:55,628 --> 02:44:57,422
Get over there.
Get over there.

1680
02:45:01,426 --> 02:45:03,219
Do you know it's me?
It's Mike.

1681
02:45:03,303 --> 02:45:04,640
Tell me, "it's Mike."

1682
02:45:04,807 --> 02:45:06,141
Tell me, "it's Mike."
It's Mike.

1683
02:45:06,265 --> 02:45:07,558
Tell me, "it's Mike."
It's Mike.

1684
02:45:07,641 --> 02:45:09,019
Mike. Mike who?

1685
02:45:09,395 --> 02:45:11,313
Mike who? Hey, Mike who?

1686
02:45:11,771 --> 02:45:13,440
"Mike who?" I don't know.

1687
02:45:18,654 --> 02:45:21,992
Nicholas, I came 12,000 miles
back here to get you.

1688
02:45:23,325 --> 02:45:25,577
Don't do that to me,
I'll fucking.. Don't do it.

1689
02:45:25,661 --> 02:45:28,288
Don't do it. Don't do it.
What's the matter with you?

1690
02:45:28,413 --> 02:45:30,498
Don't you recognize me? Huh?

1691
02:45:30,624 --> 02:45:32,918
Don't you recognize me? Huh?

1692
02:45:36,382 --> 02:45:37,674
Nicky, I love you.

1693
02:45:37,799 --> 02:45:40,133
You're my friend,
what are you doing?

1694
02:45:51,436 --> 02:45:53,147
How could you fucking
do this to me?

1695
02:45:53,272 --> 02:45:54,774
You fucking..

1696
02:45:57,903 --> 02:45:59,571
Did you hear what I said?

1697
02:45:59,696 --> 02:46:01,281
Come here,
you fucking guinea.

1698
02:46:08,413 --> 02:46:09,373
<i>Salut.</i>

1699
02:46:21,219 --> 02:46:22,678
How much?

1700
02:46:23,012 --> 02:46:25,306
"How much?"
This is how much.

1701
02:46:32,063 --> 02:46:33,774
Here, you count it.

1702
02:46:44,158 --> 02:46:45,118
C'mon, why not?

1703
02:46:46,286 --> 02:46:47,537
Why not?

1704
02:46:49,540 --> 02:46:51,041
I don't want this money.

1705
02:46:51,166 --> 02:46:52,209
You don't want the money?

1706
02:46:52,292 --> 02:46:53,543
Here, take it,
take that, too.

1707
02:46:53,711 --> 02:46:55,005
Tell him, go ahead.

1708
02:47:47,351 --> 02:47:48,686
We don't have much time.

1709
02:47:48,811 --> 02:47:50,686
We don't have
much time, Nick.

1710
02:48:17,714 --> 02:48:19,133
Don't do it.

1711
02:48:57,715 --> 02:48:59,342
Is this what you want?

1712
02:49:00,843 --> 02:49:02,345
Is this what you want?

1713
02:49:12,896 --> 02:49:14,189
I love you, Nick.

1714

Nicholas.

1715
02:49:50,312 --> 02:49:52,313
Come on, Nicky, come home.

1716
02:49:52,939 --> 02:49:55,067
Just come home. Home.

1717
02:49:57,945 --> 02:49:59,279
Talk to me.

1718
02:50:00,031 --> 02:50:01,823
Look, Nicholas,
talk to me.

1719
02:50:07,538 --> 02:50:09,038
Nicky. Nicky.

1720
02:50:10,625 --> 02:50:13,210
Wait a minute.
What did you do to your arms?

1721
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:15,921
Nicky, you remember the trees,

1722
02:50:16,046 --> 02:50:17,547
all the different ways
in the trees.

1723
02:50:17,714 --> 02:50:19,674
Remember that?
Remember? Huh?

1724
02:50:21,136 --> 02:50:23,637
The mountains.
You remember all that?

1725

One shot.

1726
02:50:25,933 --> 02:50:27,519
One shot. One shot.

1727
02:50:30,227 --> 02:50:31,187
Hey.

1728
02:50:31,563 --> 02:50:32,523
Yeah.

1729
02:50:35,942 --> 02:50:39,654
