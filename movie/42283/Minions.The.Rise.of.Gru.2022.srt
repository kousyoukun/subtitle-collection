- Here, take this. - Uh... If you ever get famous, remember who gave you your first gadget.

276
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,427
好吧。
Okay.

277
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,347
如果他对我说我不会怪他
♪ Wouldn't blame him if he said to me ♪

278
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,349
♪你不行，你不行♪
♪ You're no good, you're no good ♪

279
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:34,701
♬你不行…试着后退。
♪ You're no good... Try backwards.

280
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,616
啊。
Ah.

281
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,577
欢迎来到邪恶六人组。
Welcome to the Vicious Six.

282
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,187
哇。
Whoa.

283
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:46,147
很……哇!
That is pretty... Whoa!

284
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
你好。
Hello.

285
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:07,168
大家都来面试了吗?
Everybody here for the interview?

286
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,344
我也是。
Me, too.

287
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,215
你们等会有什么安排吗?
So, what do you guys got going on later?

288
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,608
你不怀好意吗?
Are you up to no good?

289
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:15,263
你要胡闹吗?
You gonna get into some mischief?

290
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,615
好吧。
Okay.

291
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,226
让第一个进来。
Send the first one in.

292
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,925
他们准备好见你了，格鲁先生。
They're ready to see you, Mr. Gru.

293
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,535
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

294
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,841
太好了。
Great.

295
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,408
哦……
Oh...

296
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:04,399
尊敬的恶棍们，我是格鲁。
Distinguished villains, my name is Gru.

297
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:12,973
我觉得我说话的声音太大了尽管我们的距离不需要这么大的音量。
I feel like I'm talking too loud even though our proximity doesn't require this kind of volume.

298
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:29,685
如果你在我十岁的时候告诉我，我有机会成为我最喜欢的恶棍，野指关节，我会说，你脑子里有石头
If you told me when I was ten that I would have the chance to fill the shoes of my favorite villain ever, Wild Knuckles, I would say, "You got rocks in your head."

299
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:34,734
但现在我11又4 / 4岁了，这就说得通了。
But now that I'm 11 and three quarters, it makes a lot more sense.

300
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:37,171
好吧，谁让那孩子进来的?
All right, who let the kid in?

301
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,434
我以为他是个小个子。
I thought he was a tiny man.

302
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,045
你怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

303
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:46,920
你真的认为一个弱小的孩子也能成为坏人吗?
You seriously think a puny little child can be a villain?

304
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,356
嗯,是的。
Um, yes.

305
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,576
我很卑鄙。
I-I am pretty despicable.

306
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,795
你不会想惹我的。
You don't want to cross me.

307
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:59,802
邪恶是为那些偷取强大古石并大肆破坏的成年人准备的。
Evil is for adults who steal powerful ancient stones and wreak havoc.

308
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:11,335
而不是那些胖乎乎的小混混他们应该在学校里，学习，休息，吮吸大拇指。
And not for tubby little punks who should be at school, learning, taking a recess, sucking his thumb.

309
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,773
“吸他的……”
"Sucking his..."

310
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,864
等你做了让我印象深刻的事再来。
Come back when you've done something to impress me.

311
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:20,431
下一个是谁?
Who's next?

312
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:25,611
我是荣曼，邪恶六人组的下一个成员。
I am Wing Man, the next member of the Vicious Six.

313
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:29,005
看哪，这是飞行的能力。
Behold, the power of flight!

314
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,010
好了，玩笑结束了。
All right, joke's over.

315
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,882
好戏上演。
Showtime.

316
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,409
这是一个大问题。
This is a big one.

317
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,455
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

318
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:45,718
到左边。这是正确的。
To the left. That's right.

319
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:04,406
带他进来，带他进来，伙计们。
Bring him in, bring him in, boys.

320
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,608
每个人都堆!
Everybody pile on!

321
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:10,438
他拿走了魔法石!
He took the stone!

322
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,528
我要得到他!
I'll get him!

323
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,964
噢!啊!
Oh! Ah!

324
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,794
封锁大楼。
Lock down the building.

325
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,758
噢!噢!
Oh! Oh!

326
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:31,459
——嗯?——什么?-嗯……这里没什么可看的。
- Huh? - What? -Uh... Nothing to see here.

327
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,200
——哦。-哦，看看你
- Oh. - Oh, look at you.

328
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:35,376
弗兰普顿是活着!不错的选择。
Frampton Comes Alive! Nice choice.

329
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:42,470
我…继续走。
I... Just keep walking.

330
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,786
那到底是谁?一个孩子吗?
Who the heck is that? A kid?

331
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,659
哦,伙计们。
Oh, guys.

332
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,792
——贝罗。——Mini-Boss !
- Bello. - Mini-Boss!

333
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,707
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

334
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,840
好了，上车吧。
Okay, just get on.

335
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,668
他往哪边去了?
Which way did he go?

336
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,017
那个小贼来了!
There's that little thief!

337
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,845
去吧!走,走,走!
Go! Go, go, go!

338
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,760
分手了!

339
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:28,777
咚,咚,交付。
Knock, knock. Delivery.

340
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:43,313

That demon child!

341
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:44,595
奥托，把石头带回巢穴。
Otto, take the stone back to the lair.

342
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:46,012
我要分散他们的注意力。
I'll distract them.

343
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:47,753
去吧!走,走,走!

Come on, come on!

347
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,553
噢!
Oh!

是的,宝贝。
Yeah, baby.

349
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,226
我会处理这个问题。
I'll handle this.

350
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,713
希望你能享受你短暂的余生。
Hope you enjoy the rest of your short life.

请工作。
Please work.

00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,891
快点，快点，快点!
Come on, come on, come on!

353
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,721
耶!
Yay!

Well... this kid just stole something from the worst villains in the world.

360
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:31,204
当我把它拿给他们的时候，他们会说……“我们犯了一个可怕的错误。
When I bring it back to them, they are going to say... "We have made a terrible mistake.

361
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,946

不，不是“Otto le come-ay”。
No, not "Otto le come-ay."

368
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,353

-奥托!——Mini-Boss !

你在干什么?

你看起来就像我妈在感恩节做的烤过头的火鸡。
You look like the overcooked turkey my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

696
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:52,784
哦,上帝。

710
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,446

我不能让你被鳄鱼吃掉。
I could not let you get eaten by crocodiles.

715

00:57:15,562 --> 00:57:18,696
这就是我一直想要的。
That's all I ever wanted.

718

你想要的,嗯…我不知道，你想让我…要我教你一两招吗?
You want, uh... I don't know, you want me... you want me to teach you a thing or two?

719
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:26,443
Mm-hmm-hmm !

即使我们中最小的人也能做伟大的事情。

You just dig down deep, find your inner beast, and...

724
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:02,130

01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:15,524
你介意我们上个厕所吗?
Say, do you mind if we use the john?

746
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:02,615
这个小家伙是谁?
Who's this little guy?

747
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:08,403
那是我的孙子，他还没学会孩子应该被关注而不是被倾听。
Well, that's my grandson, who still has not learned that children should be seen and not heard.

748

Only dream I ever had was doing bad stuff with my buddies.

818

We are starting a new team, and it's going to be called The Terrible Twos.

01:06:47,307 --> 01:06:55,750
我们以后可以找个更好的名字，但现在我们要找到那块石头让所有人知道你还留着它。
We can find a better name later, but right now we're going to find that stone and show everybody that you still got it.

824
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:58,623
来吧。你只是个孩子。

功夫……这是从哪里来的?

我一直在想，你不会看着我长大也不会看着我做那些可怕的事。
I've been thinking about how you won't see me grow up or be there for all the terrible things that I'm going to do.

913
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:16,632
相信我，肯定会有可怕的事情发生。

因为你，我会成为最棒的反派。
I'm going to be the best villain ever because of you.

916
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:37,261
因为你教会了我什么才是重要的。
Because you taught me what matters.

917
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:39,829
你一个人做不到任何事。
You can't do anything alone.

918
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:47,575
找到你的部落，永远不要让他们走。
Find your tribe, and never, ever let them go.

919
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:49,360

922
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:41,586
我将过一种美好而诚实的生活。

923
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:45,677
你还活着吗?

924
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,984
噢!

你让我大吃一惊。
You just blew my mind.

926
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,031
你是怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

927
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:57,645
我等不及要伪造自己的死亡来逃避当局。
I cannot wait to fake my own death to avoid the authorities.

928
01:18:57,689 --> 01:18:59,430
大胆尝试吧，孩子。
Shoot for the moon, kid.

929
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:00,736
大胆尝试。
Shoot for the moon.

930
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,043
