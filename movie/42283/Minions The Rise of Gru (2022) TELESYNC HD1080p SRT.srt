Right, right...
Okay...

166
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:32,346
When you guys tracked me down and
responded to my help, what did happen?

167
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,658
I was like
"who are these tiny tater tots?"

168
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:39,236
"And where did they get so much denim?"

169
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:49,158
And you're just wouldn't quit.

170
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:06,093
All right, I surrender.
Come on in.

171
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,490
We've had some great times since then,

172
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,478
But the thing is... The Vicious 6,
they're the big leagues.

173
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:26,283
And you guys...
are... great...

174
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:30,106
and so the job you did with the lair.

175
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,365
A plus.

176
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,393
It's just what I was thinking

177
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,273
is that there are a lot
of other villains in the world.

178
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:39,775
You know?

179
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,611
Never mind. Look.

180
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,974
I think I just need to fly solo.

181
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:52,120
See you later, alligator.

182
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:40,066
Here we go.

183
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:52,596
Excuse me.
Sir?

184
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:58,234
I was wondering if you're no good.

185
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,416
You're good. My mistake.

186
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:07,346
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

187
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:10,856
I was just trying out
this new invention of mine.

188
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:15,926
I call it "sticky fingers"
or "smart goo."

189
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,456
I haven't quite landed on the name yet.

190
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:20,482
Come here.

191
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:25,990
I overheard you were looking
for something...

192
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:27,446
Special.

193
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:32,837
I yes, I was hoping
you're no good.

194
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:40,096
I think you'll enjoy
listening in Booth 3.

195
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:44,006
Right this way.

196
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,596
This is it. Mums the word. Keep it down.

197
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:01,446
Good luck.
Let her have it, son.

198
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:03,884
Thanks mister

199
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,306
Nefario.

200
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:08,728
That's Doctor Nefario.

201
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,369
Here are the package.

202
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:14,286
If you ever get famous, remember
who gave you your first gadget.

203
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:16,756
Okay.

204
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,550
Try backwards.

205
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:38,244
Welcome to The Vicious 6.

206
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,916
That's pretty...

207
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:53,947
Hello.

208
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:02,345
Everybody here for the interview?

209
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:04,356
Me too.

210
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,526
So what do you guys
got going on later?

211
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:08,796
Are you up to no good?

212
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:11,084
Are you gonna get into some mischief?

213
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,135
Bring the first one in.

214
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,772
They're ready to see you Mr. Gru.

215
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,291
Oh, good good.

216
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:57,949
Distinguished villains,

217
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,216
My name is Gru.

218
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,010
I feel like I'm talking too loud,
even though our proximity

219
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,653
doesn't require this kind of volume.

220
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,723
If you told me when I was ten,

221
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,280
if I would have the chance to fill
the shoes of my favorite villain ever,

222
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,473
Wild Knuckles

223
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,900
I would say "you got
rocks in your head,"

224
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,393
but now that I'm 11 and 3/4
it makes a lot more sense.

225
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:33,256
All right, who let the kid in?

226
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,276
I thought he was this tiny man.

227
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,796
What's wrong with you?

228
00:24:38,263 --> 00:24:42,896
You seriously think a puny little
child can be a villain.

229
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:46,428
Umm... Yes. I'm pretty despicable.

230
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:48,776
You don't want to cross me.

231
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,840
Evil is for adults,

232
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,100
who steal powerful ancient stones
and wreak havoc,

233
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:03,670
and not for tubby little pups
who should be at school learning

234
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,093
taking a recess.

235
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:07,206
Suck, I can't stop.

236
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:13,896
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

237
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,556
Who's next?

238
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,736
I am Wingman,
the next member of The Vicious 6.

239
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:25,076
Behold, the power of flight, Sir.

240
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,194
All right, joke's over.
Show time.

241
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:41,656
right

242
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:00,830
Bring him in. Bring him in, boys!

243
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:06,572
He took the stone.

244
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:08,018
Caught him!

245
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,056
Lock down the building.

246
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:27,566
I did... nothing to see here.

247
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:31,536
Oh, look at you. Frampton Comes Alive!
Nice choice.

248
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:35,265
I uh...

249
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,096
Just keep walking.

250
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:49,516
Look at that. A kid?

251
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:53,816
Guys.

252
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:57,266
What are you doing here?

253
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,135
Okay. Just get on.

254
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,026
-Which way did he go?
-There is that little thief.

255
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:24,556
-Knock knock. Delivery!

256
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:39,021
The demon child!

257
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,176
Otto, take the stone back to the lair.

258
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,076
I'll distract them.

259
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:55,530
No, not now. Come on, come on.

260
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,093
Yeah, baby.

261
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,819
I'll handle this.

262
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:30,588
Hope you enjoy the rest of your short life.

263
00:28:31,468 --> 00:28:33,655
Please work.
Come on, come on, come on.

264
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,560
We're coming for you, tiny man!

265
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,225
They all said a kid wouldn't
be a real villain.

266
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:17,843
We-he-ell... This kid just stole something
from the worst villains in the world.

267
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:23,276
When I bring it back to them,
they're going to say...

268
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,296
"We have made a terrible mistake."

269
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,676
"Please join us."

270
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,016
"Please Gru"
and I will say...

271
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:36,386
Yes! I will be the newest
member of The Vicious 6.

272
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,836
Now all I need is Otto.

273
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,595
Where is Otto?

274
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:45,976
No, not "Otto le komay"
He needs to come in now.

275
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:53,100
-Otto!
-Mini boss!

276
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,683
There you are...

277
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,616
You got it?

278
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:04,448
Is this... Are you pulling
on my legs right now?

279
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,948
Otto, where's the stone?

280
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:20,616
What about you?

281
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:50,086
Come up.

282
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:25,056
Did you just trade my future?

283
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:27,306
For a pet rock?!

284
00:31:30,546 --> 00:31:31,913
Okay, I'll go...

285
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,953
Where was this birthday party?

286
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:41,159
This is unacceptable. Unacceptable!

287
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:44,973
I told you guys that you weren't
ready for the big leagues

288
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,663
and you have proven me correct.

289
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,866
All you do is mess everything up.

290
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,769
Ugh! What?!

291
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,586
My mom was right.

292
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:05,882
You do not belong here.
You're fired.

293
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:11,007
I'm going to find that stone.

294
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,505
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

295
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:17,406
And Otto, close your yapper!

296
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:24,886
I'll say goodbye.

297
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,736
No one ever cared if I should leave.

298
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,826
Kevin, no, I will be better
off on my own.

299
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:34,134
I'm sorry.
I thought you'll be impressed

300
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:36,296
Can I just speak to Belle Bottom?

301
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,836
Wild Knuckle!

302
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:46,946
You're alive?

303
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:50,956
Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper.

304
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,650
This could be a great opportunity
if you don't kill me.

305
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,783
Shut up and give me the stone.

306
00:33:57,634 --> 00:33:59,146
Ahh. Yes. The stone.

307
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,336
Here's the thing about that.

308
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:03,466
It's kind of a funny story.

309
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:04,596
Give it to him.

310
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:13,586
It's all going to go south very quickly.

311
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,986
What the heck is this?

312
00:34:34,203 --> 00:34:35,226
Where is it, boy?

313
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:37,766
I don't have it,
I don't have it.

314
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,296
I know you're hiding
it somewhere.

315
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,298
I'm not, I'm not. I swear.
Cross my heart and hope to die.

316
00:34:42,353 --> 00:34:43,626
Stick a needle in my eye.

317
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,136
Don't actually do that though.

318
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:46,636
Somebody bring me a phone.

319
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:52,540
Call home. It's ransom time.

320
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:56,426
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me.

321
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,266
Good one. Call!

322
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,146
Who is this?

323
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,026
Kevin lay what?

324
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:42,236
You kidding me?
You got henchmen?

325
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,870
Well, that's the end of that.

326
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,167
Listen, you. Bring the stone to me
in San Francisco.

327
00:35:49,192 --> 00:35:53,433

Oh ho ho... The stone.

330

Gave that to my uncle.
It's more his style.

Bank of Evil.

490
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,828
It's showtime, kid.

491
01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:44,858
Follow my lead and
don't forget your cue.

492
01:00:46,665 --> 01:00:49,374
Hello I... I just need to cash this.

493
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:52,248
Oh wowie zowie! What a big bank!

494
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:54,828
How many security guards
are in here?

495
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,268
Who's this little guy?

496
01:00:56,505 --> 01:01:02,258
Well, that's my grandson who still has not learned
that children should be seen and not heard.

497
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:05,848
Haha, kids.
I actually have a son of my own.

498
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,568
Yeah, you look so weird.

499
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:10,547
Oh haha, don't listen to him.

500
01:01:10,642 --> 01:01:12,794
Your son is very uh...

501
01:01:12,962 --> 01:01:13,868
cute.

502
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:25,741
Help I'm seeing a white light.
Helen, I'm coming for you.

503
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:31,248
Helen, I'm coming for you...

504
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:32,634
Oh... help!

505
01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:35,370
Help my grandpa.

506
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:37,968
Somebody help him.

507
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,605
My grandpa!

508
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:43,998
This is the big one.

509
01:01:47,935 --> 01:01:48,694
You hear that?

510
01:01:49,325 --> 01:01:51,328
It's the sweet sound of angels.

511
01:01:54,807 --> 01:01:58,303
Do something, my life
is flashing before my eyes.

512
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:14,278
No, no, no.
The other way, the other way.

513
01:02:18,995 --> 01:02:20,478
All right.
Everyone stand back.

514
01:02:21,945 --> 01:02:22,473
Uh-oh...

515
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,528
-Clear.
-Wait a minute, wait.

516
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,998
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

517
01:02:29,073 --> 01:02:30,828
No, no, no.
I'm feeling better.

518
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:31,749
Clear!

519
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:35,246
Maximum charge.

520
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:36,068
Clear.

521
01:02:37,413 --> 01:02:39,523
You saved my grandpa.

522
01:02:40,568 --> 01:02:42,638
Did we... Did we do the heist?

523
01:02:43,498 --> 01:02:46,095
Grandpa say the darnest things.

524
01:02:47,035 --> 01:02:48,146
You dropped this.

525
01:02:52,658 --> 01:02:54,182
Look what I got.

526
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:56,198
Hey, not bad.

527
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:57,398
Not bad at all.

528
01:02:57,515 --> 01:02:58,818
We make a good team.

529
01:03:00,462 --> 01:03:02,895
Oh yeah, hey,
we got to keep at it.

530
01:03:03,102 --> 01:03:05,005
Wait till you see what I'm
gonna teach you next.

531
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:07,141
I cannot wait.

532
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:08,743
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

533
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:44,265
Time to strike.

534
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:17,149
They're not here.

535
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:18,678
Fan out and find them.

536
01:04:35,695 --> 01:04:37,658
Something big is going
down in Frisco.

537
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:49,078
Whoo. There it is.

538
01:04:53,675 --> 01:04:55,228
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

539
01:04:58,085 --> 01:04:59,768
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

540
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:03,508
Hey, so welcome. Good luck.

541
01:05:26,935 --> 01:05:30,346
My friend, you're not gonna
learn from the old school.

542
01:05:30,825 --> 01:05:31,557
Umm?

543
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:37,893
Oh no...

544
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:53,197
[WILD KNUCKLES FOUNDS THE VICIOUS SIX]

545
01:05:55,195 --> 01:05:57,638
I can't believe they did this to me.

546
01:05:58,274 --> 01:06:00,698
I... I taught them everything they know.

547
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,708
We were a team.

548
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:04,428
Umm?

549
01:06:05,425 --> 01:06:06,208
I give up.

550
01:06:09,605 --> 01:06:10,277
Hey.

551
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:12,426
You are a great bad guy.

552
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,789
They are stupid idiots.

553
01:06:15,382 --> 01:06:19,165
Only dream I ever had was
doing bad stuff with my buddies.

554
01:06:20,235 --> 01:06:23,383
Now look at me, old... alone...

555
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,968
Well, you are old.

556
01:06:26,745 --> 01:06:27,958
But you're not alone.

557
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:33,748
All right, listen up, buster.

558
01:06:34,752 --> 01:06:38,462
We are starting a new team
and it's going to be called

559
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:40,115
The Terrible Twos.

560
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:42,935
We can find a better name later,

561
01:06:43,002 --> 01:06:46,392
but right now we are going
to find that stone

562
01:06:46,462 --> 01:06:49,145
and show everybody that you still got it.

563
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:53,455
Come on, you're just a little kid.
It's over.

564
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:55,813
-Go home.
-But you said we...

565
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:57,167
Go home!

566
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:46,142
Otto?

567
01:07:58,443 --> 01:08:00,943
Otto!
Mini boss!

568
01:08:02,056 --> 01:08:03,384
Mini boss!

569
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:14,948
You found the stone.

570
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:16,968
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

571
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:20,749
Hurry, we don't have much time.

572
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:22,358
We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.

573
01:08:35,784 --> 01:08:38,531
Long time no see, punk.

574
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,188
I'll take that.

575
01:08:52,326 --> 01:08:55,744
Anti-Villain League. You are under arrest.

576
01:09:00,685 --> 01:09:05,338
Well, well, well, everybody...
Did you forget what time it is?

577
01:09:19,309 --> 01:09:21,438
Happy New Year!

578
01:09:26,614 --> 01:09:27,864
Fire!

579
01:09:49,677 --> 01:09:51,298
Stand your ground.

580
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:08,862
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, NO!

581
01:10:10,171 --> 01:10:12,260
Where do you think you're going?

582
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:16,772
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay.

583
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:25,858
Enjoy being torn apart.

584
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:29,242
Guys!

585
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,995
Oh...
Why don't we make this a fair fight?

586
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:45,827
Oh... You thought I was serious?

587
01:10:56,538 --> 01:10:58,567
Hello, traitors!

588
01:10:59,624 --> 01:11:01,428
Remember me?

589
01:11:02,964 --> 01:11:04,117
You?

590
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:06,098
You can leave me for dead,

591
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:11,408
You destroy everything I own,
but I will not let you hurt that kid.

592
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,768
Oh...
So you're gonna save the kid?

593
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:16,208
Yeah, you and what army?

594
01:11:18,736 --> 01:11:21,018
Okay... this army.

595
01:12:22,364 --> 01:12:27,188
Dig down deep.
Find your inner beast.

596
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:46,347
Otto.

597
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:48,730
Hurry! Faster!

598
01:14:31,002 --> 01:14:32,466
Get away from him.

599
01:14:32,491 --> 01:14:34,361
Destroy the kid.

600
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:53,990
No!

601
01:14:56,730 --> 01:15:00,773
How does it feel to be beaten
by the tiny little bug?

602
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:07,277
You guys were amazing.

603
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:10,011
The Kung Fu,
where did that come from?

604
01:15:10,179 --> 01:15:12,726
Obviously, you guys are re-hired.

605
01:15:43,936 --> 01:15:46,458
Oh, no. Wild Knuckles.

606
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:50,568
-Gru
-Hey

607
01:15:50,929 --> 01:15:53,156
You're gonna be OK, right?

608
01:15:53,214 --> 01:15:54,948
Don't worry about me, kid.

609
01:15:55,226 --> 01:15:56,858
I'll be fine.

610
01:15:57,355 --> 01:15:58,428
Finally.

611
01:15:58,702 --> 01:16:02,042
You are going away
for a long, long time.

612
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,588
Yeah, well, I wouldn't bet on it.

613
01:16:06,182 --> 01:16:06,898
No.

614
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,449
See you soon kiddo.

615
01:16:44,888 --> 01:16:48,048
Wild Knuckles
was my favorite villain.

616
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:54,628
We didn't have much time together,
but the time we did have...

617
01:16:54,947 --> 01:16:57,112
I'm so grateful for

618
01:16:57,544 --> 01:17:01,607
I've been thinking about how you
won't see me grow up or be there

619
01:17:01,632 --> 01:17:05,279
for all the terrible things
that I'm going to do.

620
01:17:05,304 --> 01:17:09,674
Believe me,
they're gonna some awful things

621
01:17:19,366 --> 01:17:21,398
But I'm going to make you proud.

622
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:26,548
I'm going to be the best villain
ever because of you.

623
01:17:26,963 --> 01:17:32,958
Because you taught me what matters,
you can't do anything alone.

624
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:36,718
Find your tribe.

625
01:17:37,077 --> 01:17:40,202
And never ever let them go.

626
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,768
Otto.

627
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:30,388
You better stay out of trouble, kid.

628
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:34,900
I will live a
good and honest life.

629
01:18:37,322 --> 01:18:38,878
You're alive?

630
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:43,884
You just blew my mind.

631
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:45,598
How could you do that?

632
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:50,701
I cannot wait to fake my own death
to avoid the authorities.

633
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:54,138
Shoot for the moon, kid.
Shoot for the moon.

634
01:18:55,961 --> 01:18:58,158
See you later, suckers.

635
01:19:33,146 --> 01:19:43,420
I need a scientist who is very genius.
You want to work for me?

636
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,502
No, I am done with villainy
off the happier horizon.

637
01:19:48,693 --> 01:19:50,548
Goodbye, you old chap.

638
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:08,420
Ohhh... All right, all right. Fine.
Stop with a face. I'm in.

639
01:20:09,519 --> 01:20:11,252
Wanna see something cool?

640
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,311
Are you kidding me?

641
01:20:31,682 --> 01:20:33,966
Big boss, I like that.
