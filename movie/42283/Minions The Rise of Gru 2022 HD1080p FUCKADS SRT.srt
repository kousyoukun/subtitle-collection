116
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:04,006
OK fine fine because you had the nightmare
but just tonight.

00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:15,526
I don't dig it.

133
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:16,926
There's nothing to dig.

134
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,376
They thought they could leave me
for dead, huh?

135
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,686
Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat.

136
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,536

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,183
but The thing is, the vicious sex
didn't the big leagues and you guys.

173
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,466
Or

174
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,186
Gray.

175
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:52,326
And so the champion did in Delaware.

176
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:54,586
A plus.

177
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,593
It's just what I was thinking

178
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,473
is that there are a lot
of other villains in the world.

179
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:01,636
Now.

180
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:04,970
OK,

181
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,983
never mind work, I think I
just need to fly solo.

182
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:17,286
People gonna go.

183
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:20,566
Getting backlash.

184
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:24,366
yes

185
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:28,496
No.

186
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:31,676
You know that.

187
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:34,516
I did.

188
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:35,890
let

189
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:38,586
No.

190
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:46,880
cool

191
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:02,266
Here we go.

192
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:13,496
excuse

193
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:14,796
son

194
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,896
wondering if you're.

195
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:20,386
No.

196
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:22,026
well

197
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:23,616
My mistake.

198
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:26,586
Ohh

199
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,546
sorry I didn't mean to scare you.

200
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:33,056
I was just trying out
this new invention of mine.

201
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:38,146
Our cool it get your fingers
or smart good.

202
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:40,656
I haven't quite landed on the name yet.

203
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:42,356
Algeria.

204
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:47,966
I overheard you were looking
for something.

205
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:49,646
Special.

206
00:20:50,523 --> 00:20:55,116
I yes, I was hoping
you're no good.

207
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:02,296
I think you'll enjoy
listening in Booth 3.

208
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,206
Right this way.

209
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,090
yeah

210
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:20,666
This isn't mums.

211
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:21,796
The word keep it down.

212
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:22,396
Good luck.

213
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,646
Let her have it, son.

214
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:27,506
Thanks Mr Mayor fario.

215
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,626
right doctor nefario

216
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:31,796
hey.

217
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:36,486
If you ever get famous, remember
who gave you your first gadget.

218
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:38,956
OK.

219
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:58,196
Go.

220
00:21:59,123 --> 00:21:59,816
Sisters

221
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:03,116
really.

222
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:15,586
Hello.

223
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:23,596
Everybody hears what they.

224
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:26,556
Me too.

225
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,726
So what do you guys
got going on later?

226
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:30,996
Are you up to no good?

227
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,066
Then you gonna get it?

228
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:41,496
Within the first one there,
they're ready to.

229
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:45,316
Oh, good good.

230
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:19,796
This danglish village.

231
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,416
My name is crew.

232
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,210
I feel like I'm talking too loud,
even though our proximity

233
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,853
doesn't require this kind of volume.

234
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,923
If you told me when I was ten,

235
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,480
if I would have the chance
to fill the shoes of my favorite filling ever,

236
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,673
why don't merkels?

237
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,100
I would say you got
the rocks in your head,

238
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,593
but now that I'm 11 and 3/4
it makes a lot more sense.

239
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,456
All right, who let the kid in?

240
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,476
I thought he was this tiny man.

241
00:23:58,153 --> 00:23:59,996
What's wrong with you?

242
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:05,096
Really think a puny little child
can be a villain.

243
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:10,976
Pretty despicable,
you don't want to cross me.

244
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,080
Evil is for adults

245
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,300
who steal powerful ancient stones
and wreak havoc,

246
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:25,870
and not for tubby little pups
who should be at school learning

247
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,293
taking a recess.

248
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:29,406
Suck, I can't stop.

249
00:24:34,093 --> 00:24:36,096
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

250
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:37,756
Who's that?

251
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:43,936
I am with man,
the next fever of the vicious 6.

252
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,276
Behold, the power of flight, Sir.

253
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:52,206
Alright, so.

254
00:24:57,283 --> 00:24:57,556
one

255
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:03,856
right

256
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:27,866
OK, that's this.

257
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:29,316
Call

258
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:37,256
building.

259
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:49,766
I did nothing here.

260
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,736
Your breathing comes alive
nice Joyce.

261
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:57,196
Hello.

262
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:00,296
Just keep walking.

263
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:11,716
Deserve a kid.

264
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,016
Guys.

265
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:19,466
What are you doing here?

266
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:22,876
Just get that.

267
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:46,756
A little rain.

268
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:56,616
Huh?

269
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:00,226
That didn't.

270
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,376
We'll take the phone back
to the lair.

271
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,276
I'll distract them.

272
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:16,876
No, come on.

273
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:52,396
Enjoy the rest of the start.

274
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:10,886
We're coming for you.

275
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:14,366
More.

276
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,970
i

277
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:32,426
Again, wouldn't be
a real villain.

278
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,310
This guys just those happening
from

279
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,323
villains in the.

280
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:45,476
When I bring it back to them,
they're going to say.

281
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:49,496
It's terrible to stake.

282
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:50,876
Please join us.

283
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,216
Please crew
and I will say.

284
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:58,586
I will be the newest member
of the vicious say.

285
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,936
Is Apple where is Arthur?

286
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:06,436
No, that's not
don't look gourmet.

287
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:08,176
He needs to come now.

288
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:18,816
That is.

289
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:27,516
Is this are you pulling
on my legs right now though?

290
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:29,606
Where's this done this good?

291
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:31,646
They call it boom.

292
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:42,816
What about you?

293
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:12,286
Come up.

294
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:21,306
Piano.

295
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:41,026
The physical is not.

296
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:47,256
Did you just trade my future?

297
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,506
For a, that's not.

298
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,330
OK,

299
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,153
where was this birthday party?

300
00:30:59,113 --> 00:30:59,726
I don't remember.

301
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:03,536
Is that the ball acceptable?

302
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,173
I told you guys that you weren't
ready for the big leagues

303
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,863
and you have proven me correct.

304
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,066
You guys messed everything up.

305
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:15,426
Up

306
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:18,246
wow.

307
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:23,786
My mom was right.

308
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:28,096
You do not belong here,
you're fired.

309
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:35,686
I'm going to find that stop
when I get home you open the record.

310
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,606
Close your yapper.

311
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:44,536
see

312
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,086
I'll say goodbye.

313
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,936
No one ever cared if I should leave.

314
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:56,416
Let them on.

315
00:31:58,823 --> 00:32:02,026
Kevin, no, I will be better
off on my own.

316
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,846
Live with that.

317
00:32:07,643 --> 00:32:08,826
I just can't see.

318
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:13,206
So.

319
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:15,866
move

320
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:19,376
Those.

321
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,136
It's a boy.

322
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:58,496
I'm sorry I thought to be impressed
and I just speak to Bell bottom.

323
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:01,456
Good.

324
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:06,036
Why isn't that cool?

325
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:09,146
We're alive.

326
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:13,156
Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper.

327
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,850
This could be a great opportunity
if you don't kill me,

328
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,983
shut up
and give me this stone.

329
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,346
Ohh this this stuff.

330
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:23,536
Here's the thing about that.

331
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:25,666
It's kind of a funny story.

332
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:26,796
Give it to him.

333
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:35,786
Going to go South very quickly.

334
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:40,186
Well done, heck is this.

335
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:46,066
You're at.

336
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:57,426
Where is it going?

337
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,966
I don't have it,
I don't have it.

338
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:01,496
I know you're hiding
it somewhere.

339
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:05,826
Stick a needle in my eye.

340
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,336
Don't actually do that though.

341
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:08,836
Somebody bring me a phone.

342
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:15,106
Call home it's ransom time.

343
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,626
Probably pay you the kidney.

344
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,466
Move one full.

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,213
where you are never going to see
your little boss again.

353
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:25,346
That's not done.

354
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:26,736
I don't care.

355
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:27,406
So now.

356
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:31,906
I don't know.

357
00:35:33,953 --> 00:35:34,746
We grew up though.

358
00:35:39,143 --> 00:35:39,986
Oh no, no.

359
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:04,216
What's up?

360
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:07,406
OK, Google.

361
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:16,716
Stone.

362
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:18,806
But it was.

363
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:21,696
It's more his style.

364
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:25,816
Oh

365
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:51,646
I told you I don't know where
you went you stupid Twinkies.

366
00:36:58,923 --> 00:36:59,156
OK.

367
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:01,216
Bully.

368
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:07,436
Not cool man.

369
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,716
Thank God I did something like that.

370
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:12,866
But

371
00:37:19,373 --> 00:37:20,496
San Francisco.

372
00:37:25,573 --> 00:37:26,006
I don't know.

373
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:28,316
What kind of weather?

374
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,056
Come in, get out.

375
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:39,786
Let's rock and roll time
to get our stone back.

376
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,546
We're coming for you, Mr grew.

377
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:54,856
Murder.

378

386
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:49,486
And I had to turn back
at LaGuardia.

387
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:53,426

399
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,270
Yeah.

400
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:52,806

401
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:32,696

receive a compliment?

403
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:43,976
Right now, well, it's about
to become your nightmare.

404
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:48,736
Welcome to my newest torture
device and disco inferno.

405
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,360
Your minions better get it
by sundown tomorrow

406
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,613
because in 48 hours of discount
on kill you the blade will.

407
00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:23,286
So that.

00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:44,036

Next up brain St.

415
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:36,156
Who does like any?

416
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:43,456
Yeah.

417
00:43:48,483 --> 00:43:49,086
Minivan.

418

No no no no OK OK?

We're going to go back.

421
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:31,306
Go go.

422
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:38,006
Wait a minute.

423
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:41,336
Hello.

424
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:49,606

426
00:45:35,293 --> 00:45:38,626
OK, now you might feel
a little pinch.

427
00:45:47,473 --> 00:45:49,426
Time to bring some fun.

428
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:58,706
Any plans for the weekend?

429
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:07,767
25 deep breaths.

430
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,806
You like picking
on little guys, huh?

431
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,456
Don't take a nap, old lady.

432
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:19,036
Lady.

433
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:28,640

Ancient Shaolin art
of Kung Fu.

435
00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:00,366
No.

436
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,406
Get lost.

437
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:13,386
If you come back to our place,
you're dead.

438
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:14,856
Come in.

439
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:20,996
Thank you, thank you.

440
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:27,666
You can thank me
by going away, I'm working.

441
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:29,526
computer

442
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:32,656
you want to learn Kung Fu?

443
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:35,446
You didn't.

444
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:38,766
Fu

445
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:49,136
my teaching days are over.

446
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:51,126
This is my life now.

447
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:53,840
look

448
00:47:55,593 --> 00:47:57,616
I have my level,
you just come through.

449
00:47:58,363 --> 00:47:58,916
But I see that.

450
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,286
If a boy.

451
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:09,336
I.

452
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:12,906
I will teach you.

453
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:17,880
Hey,

454
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,313
those are not for you.

455
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:23,766
The name of the game
is sell, sell, sell.

456
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:26,656
LA

457
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:50,706
Where is groom?

458
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,916
How should I know what's
with the costumes?

459
00:48:54,043 --> 00:48:55,606
Halloween was four months ago.

460
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:56,666
You look stupid.

461
00:48:57,123 --> 00:48:58,586
That's off shoe.

462
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,346
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

463
00:49:01,463 --> 00:49:02,906
Let me help you with that, dearie.

464
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:05,936
Yeah, where's the boy?

465
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:10,796
I didn't mean to scare you.

466
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:13,536
Don't worry,
we're not mad at him.

467
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,030
We just want to

468
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,993
hire him.

469
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:20,916
Where is it?

470
00:49:23,943 --> 00:49:27,666
Why not go live
and working with the kid?

471
00:49:28,463 --> 00:49:31,026
We're going to San Francisco.

472
00:49:38,253 --> 00:49:40,586
You had better be paying for my roof.

473
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:46,596
Pretty groovy high.

474
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:50,756
What?

475
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:55,636
We begin with a basic kick.

476
00:49:57,263 --> 00:49:57,626
How do you?

477
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,500
OK, no kick.

478
00:50:05,323 --> 00:50:06,526
This is a melon hammer.

479
00:50:06,763 --> 00:50:07,626
It's a weapon.

480
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:09,386
This is Fred.

481
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:10,486
He is a dummy.

482
00:50:10,923 --> 00:50:12,986
Never underestimate a dummy.

483
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:16,546
No attack.

484
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:37,716
My time.

485
00:50:39,823 --> 00:50:42,886
Don't tell to me
I cannot break this wood.

486
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:46,636
But doubt exists
only in the mind.

487
00:50:47,073 --> 00:50:49,136
You know what I say
to my mind.

488
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:54,096
Now you gay.

489
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,186
kevin kevin kenny

490
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:15,846
Looks like I can.

491
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:26,667
OK, clearly we are not ready
for philosophy.

492
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,067
Let's just trade.

493
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:32,026
Oh

494
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:46,266
OK OK OK yeah.

495
00:51:47,343 --> 00:51:47,866
Yeah.

496
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:50,176
Yeah.

497
00:51:55,923 --> 00:51:56,216
Hello.

498
00:52:05,063 --> 00:52:08,496
Rest up tomorrow's going
to be even worse.

499
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,066
Why you're quitting?

500
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:14,566
I told you what I get, that stone?

501
00:52:14,703 --> 00:52:15,986
We're going to be unstoppable.

502
00:52:16,273 --> 00:52:17,586
I have had enough.

503
00:52:17,703 --> 00:52:20,266
There's nothing sadder
than an aging village.

504
00:52:22,243 --> 00:52:24,526
Guys, come on, we're a team.

505
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:35,766
Hope you like it.

506
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:38,646
Is this?

507
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:42,326
I just had to fire
my henchman, you know why?

508
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,467
Because they weren't getting
the job done.

509
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,500
OK, I'm just gonna untie you now because I

510
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,893
I I I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

511
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,440
You know, kind of nice to have
a little company around here,

512
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:57,823
yeah?

513
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:01,156
Just throwing some jars.

514
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:02,686
Well, those are kind of trouble.

515
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,896
We could get them though.

516
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:06,726
What's that?

517
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:09,466
That's your evil chuckle, obviously.

518
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:10,846
Well, it stinks.

519
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:14,426
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo really well?

520
00:53:14,503 --> 00:53:17,726
You look like a wizard going
through an end of life crisis.

521
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:19,866
Vehicles.

522
00:53:20,603 --> 00:53:21,626
Who's done rickles?

523
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,840
oh

524
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:45,176
Dude.

525
00:53:46,613 --> 00:53:48,456
I thought we lost you
there for a minute.

526
00:53:52,803 --> 00:53:53,266
Trying to swim.

527
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,166
Hey soul brother,
we're getting off to.

528
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,400
Let's go back to Frisco Frisco.

529
00:54:06,853 --> 00:54:09,276
It's so lucky day chick
I'm heading up the coast.

530
00:54:09,393 --> 00:54:10,636
I could drop you off on the way.

531
00:54:20,013 --> 00:54:20,296
People.

532
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:23,267
look

533
00:54:57,973 --> 00:54:59,076
Start with the pool.

534
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,046
This place you going to be
sticking spared.

535
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:02,216
What are you doing?

536
00:55:02,323 --> 00:55:03,976
You look like the overcooked Turkey.

537
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,567
My mom makes some Thanksgiving.

538
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,030
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,

539
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,313
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

540
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,566
Yeah, well doesn't scare me.

541
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,603
Be careful I can't have you losing all

542
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,753
because they need you to change
some light bulbs after this, yeah.

543
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:29,906
I'm sorry how it's done.

544
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:33,376
Knock it off.

545
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:37,606
Google.

546
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:42,736
However, no, no no.

547
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:44,066
no

548
00:55:45,183 --> 00:55:45,766
Wow.

549
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:48,036
goodnight

550
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:50,926
I got there.

551
00:55:53,873 --> 00:55:54,796
I thought that you.

552
00:55:58,753 --> 00:55:59,446
Take my hand.

553
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:00,436
Cool.

554
00:56:13,793 --> 00:56:17,916
You gonna run well,
you were you didn't I told you?

555
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,576
My favorite.

556
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:23,900
World I could not let you could even
by crocodiles.

557
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:26,796
Even though that would have been
kind of cool to watch.

558
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:31,286
So, so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

559
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,100
That's all I ever wanted.

560
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,300
You want I don't know you want me.

561
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:39,033
Do you have any teacher thing or two?

562
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:43,016
Many

563
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:49,406
how did I become a great master?

564
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:05,126
Even the smallest of us are capable
of great things.

565
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:10,796
You just dig down deep,
find, join the please and.

566
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:17,316
doesn't

567
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:19,586
Now you try.

568
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:37,516
Find your.

569
00:57:40,553 --> 00:57:41,136
Stop this.

570
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:50,976
We have a lot more work to do.

571
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:06,700
Coach

572
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:04,367
Kevin Stuart and Bob
you are ready.

573
00:59:09,803 --> 00:59:10,296
Ready for you?

574
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:12,586
4 chievement badges.

575
00:59:14,773 --> 00:59:15,406
They're dead.

576
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,467
First rule of ice.

577
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,170
Always stay in character,

578
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,003
Grandpa.

579
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:29,886
See.

580
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:34,766
My boy Dexter here can't hold it
in till we get home.

581
00:59:49,913 --> 00:59:50,576
Bank of.

582
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,666
It's Showtime kid.

583
01:00:04,453 --> 01:00:06,696
Follow my lead and don't forget
your cube.

584
01:00:08,503 --> 01:00:14,086
Hello I I just need to cash this oh wow
is that way what The Big Bang?

585
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:16,666
How many security guards
are in here?

586
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:18,106
Who's this little guy?

587
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:24,096
Well that's my grandson who still has not learned
that children should be seen and not heard.

588
01:00:25,423 --> 01:00:27,686
It's actually have a son of my own.

589
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:30,406
Yeah, you look so weird.

590
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,890
Your son is very

591
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,303
cute.

592
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:47,286
Help I'm seeing you like Ellen,

Said nothing helped him.

596
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,836
This is the big one.

597
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:10,316
You're here.

598
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:13,166
This is the sweet
sound of angels.

599
01:01:16,963 --> 01:01:19,716
Something my life
is flashing before my eyes.

600
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,096
The other way, the other way.

601
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:40,920
all

602
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:42,316
Stand back.

603
01:01:44,343 --> 01:01:45,366
Wait a minute, wait.

604
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:50,836
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

605
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:52,686
You have a.

606
01:01:57,483 --> 01:01:57,906
Clear.

607
01:01:59,603 --> 01:01:59,796
so

608
01:02:03,193 --> 01:02:04,216
Did we do the high?

609
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,446
Well said the darkest day.

610
01:02:08,873 --> 01:02:09,636
You've done this.

611
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:18,036
Hey not bad.

612
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:19,236
Not bad at all.

613
01:02:19,353 --> 01:02:20,656
We make a good team.

614
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,513
Oh yeah, hey,

615
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,733
we got to keep fighting

616
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,843
when did you see what I'm
going to teach you next?

617
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:02,486
OK, do you want to do it?

618
01:03:38,243 --> 01:03:40,516
Love hair fan out
and find them.

619
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,496
Something big is going
down in Frisco.

620
01:04:09,703 --> 01:04:10,226
Daddy

621
01:04:12,363 --> 01:04:12,816
put it down.

622
01:04:15,513 --> 01:04:17,066
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

623
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,606
You know I'm going to miss you.

624
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,346
Hey so welcome good luck.

625
01:04:48,773 --> 01:04:51,646
My friend, you're not going
to learn from the old school.

626
01:04:52,663 --> 01:04:52,996
Umm?

627
01:04:59,183 --> 01:04:59,556
No.

628
01:05:17,033 --> 01:05:19,476
I can't believe they did this to me.

629
01:05:20,953 --> 01:05:22,536
I've looked up everything they know.

630
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,396
We were a team.

631
01:05:25,883 --> 01:05:26,266
Umm?

632
01:05:27,263 --> 01:05:28,046
I give up.

633
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:31,596
Hey.

634
01:05:32,353 --> 01:05:33,896
You are a great bad guy.

635
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,276
They are stupid idiots.

636
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,693
Only dream I ever had

637
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,003
was doing bad stuff
with my buddies.

638
01:05:42,073 --> 01:05:45,026
Now look at me old long.

639
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:47,806
Well, you are old.

640
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,796
But you're not alone.

641
01:05:53,403 --> 01:05:55,586
All right, listen up, Buster.

642
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:00,300
We are starting a new thing
and it's going to be called

643
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,503
the terrible twos.

644
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,773
We can find a better name later,

645
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,230
but right now we are going
to find that stone

646
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,983
and show everybody that you still got it.

647
01:06:12,603 --> 01:06:14,926
It's just a little kid,
it's all over.

648
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:17,656
Go home, what do you said?

649
01:07:35,463 --> 01:07:36,786
You found this stall.

650
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:38,806
You

651
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:42,606
we don't have much time.

652
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,196
We got to get this to wild levels.

653
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,436
Long time no see.

654
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:04,026
Like that?

655
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:17,306
Billy, you are under arrest.

656
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:27,176
Everybody, could you forget
what time it is?

657
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:07,956
no

658
01:09:28,533 --> 01:09:28,866
No no.

659
01:09:30,483 --> 01:09:31,016
And now.

660
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:36,476
What do you think you're going
you stole from us?

661
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:39,716
God.

662
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:47,696
Being torn apart.

663
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:49,486
Honey.

664
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,080
Guys,

665
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,813
why don't we make this a fair fight?

666
01:10:07,323 --> 01:10:07,826
Serious.

667
01:10:19,163 --> 01:10:20,386
Come on Raiders.

668
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,266
Remember Mary?

669
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:27,936
You can leave me for dead.

670
01:10:28,453 --> 01:10:33,246
You destroy everything I own,
but I will not let you her test it.

671
01:10:34,283 --> 01:10:35,606
So you're going to save the kid.

672
01:10:36,383 --> 01:10:38,046
Yeah, you and what army?

673
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:42,856
Oh good, this army.

674
01:10:49,323 --> 01:10:50,096
Ohh

675
01:10:56,013 --> 01:10:56,836
ah.

676
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:46,316
Dig down deep.

677
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:49,026
Please.

678
01:12:26,173 --> 01:12:26,576
Hmm.

679
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:44,176
Come in.

680
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:54,616
Get away from him.

681
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,426
Destroy the kid.

682
01:14:06,223 --> 01:14:06,666
Hello.

683
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,946
How does it feel to be beaten
by the happy little bug?

684
01:14:26,983 --> 01:14:29,506
You guys were amazing.

685
01:14:29,713 --> 01:14:32,306
The Kung Fu,
where did that come from?

686
01:14:32,603 --> 01:14:34,806
Obviously you guys are really high.

687
01:14:37,093 --> 01:14:37,276
cool

688
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,296
No well beckles.

689
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:11,326
Brew.

690
01:15:12,173 --> 01:15:12,406
Hey.

691
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:15,316
You're gonna be OK, right?

692
01:15:15,613 --> 01:15:16,786
Don't worry about big kid.

693
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:18,696
Fine.

694
01:15:19,763 --> 01:15:20,266
Finally.

695
01:15:21,023 --> 01:15:24,096
You are going away
for a long, long time.

696
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:26,426
Yeah, well, I wouldn't bet on it.

697
01:15:28,613 --> 01:15:28,756
No.

698
01:15:29,843 --> 01:15:31,306
See you soon kiddo.

699
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:09,886
Knuckles
was my favorite villain.

700
01:16:11,723 --> 01:16:16,466
We didn't have much time together,
but the time we did have.

701
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,950
I'm so grateful for

702
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:23,833
I've been thinking about how you
won't see me grow up or be there

703
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:28,123
for all the terrible things
that I'm going to do, but we've.

704
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:43,236
But I'm going to make you proud.

705
01:16:44,123 --> 01:16:48,386
I'm going to be the best feeling
ever because of you.

706
01:16:49,413 --> 01:16:54,796
Because you taught me what matters,
you can't do anything alone.

707
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:58,576
Find your tribe.

708
01:16:59,383 --> 01:17:02,206
And never ever let them go.

709
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:04,606
Auto.

710
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:08,746
Videos.

711
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:11,366
thought

712
01:17:13,393 --> 01:17:15,596
to give back that.

713
01:17:37,493 --> 01:17:38,656
But I like it OK.

714
01:17:50,283 --> 01:17:52,226
You better stay out of trouble,
kid.

715
01:17:54,733 --> 01:17:57,086
Good and honest life.

716
01:18:00,123 --> 01:18:00,716
Why?

717
01:18:04,363 --> 01:18:05,966
You have to blow my mind.

718
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:07,436
How could you do that?

719
01:18:08,303 --> 01:18:12,706
I cannot wait to fake my own death
to avoid the authorities.

720
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:15,966
Choose for the mode.

721
01:18:19,633 --> 01:18:19,996
Girls.

722
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,050
It's.

723
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:48,233
No, I am done with villainy
off the happier horizon.

724
01:18:49,603 --> 01:18:50,606
Goodbye little chap.

725
01:18:52,213 --> 01:18:52,566
Apple.

726
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:08,900
Ohhh alright alright fine stop
with a face I'm in.

727
01:19:10,343 --> 01:19:11,706
Wanna see something cool?

728
01:19:33,433 --> 01:19:34,233
I like that.

729
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:35,967
yeah
