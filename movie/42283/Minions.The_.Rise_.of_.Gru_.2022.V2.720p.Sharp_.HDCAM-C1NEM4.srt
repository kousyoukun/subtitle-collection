00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,426
Oh, you want to come?

166
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:55,433
Right, right...
Okay...

167
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:02,346
When you guys tracked me down and
responded to my help, what did happen?

168
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,658
I was like 
"who are these tiny tater tots?"

169
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,236
"And where did they get so much denim?"

170
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:19,158
And you're just wouldn't quit.

171
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:36,093
All right, I surrender.
Come on in.

172
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,490
We've had some great times since then,

173
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,478
But the thing is... The Vicious 6,
they're the big leagues.

174
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:56,283
And you guys...
are... great...

175
00:19:56,703 --> 00:20:00,106
and so the job you did with the lair.

176
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:02,365
A plus.

177
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,393
It's just what I was thinking

178
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,273
is that there are a lot
of other villains in the world.

179
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:09,775
You know?

180
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,611
Never mind. Look.

181
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,974
I think I just need to fly solo.

182
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,120
See you later, alligator.

183
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,066
Here we go.

184
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,596
Excuse me.
Sir?

185
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:28,234
I was wondering if you're no good.

186
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:31,416
You're good. My mistake.

187
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,346
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

188
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:40,856
I was just trying out
this new invention of mine.

189
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:45,926
I call it "sticky fingers"
or "smart goo."

190
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:48,456
I haven't quite landed on the name yet.

191
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,482
Come here.

192
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,990
I overheard you were looking
for something...

193
00:21:56,963 --> 00:21:57,446
Special.

194
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:02,837
I yes, I was hoping
you're no good.

195
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:10,096
I think you'll enjoy
listening in Booth 3.

196
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:14,006
Right this way.

197
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,596
This is it. Mums the word. Keep it down.

198
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:31,446
Good luck.
Let her have it, son.

199
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:33,884
Thanks mister

200
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,306
Nefario.

201
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,728
That's Doctor Nefario.

202
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,369
Here are the package.

203
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:44,286
If you ever get famous, remember
who gave you your first gadget.

204
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:46,756
Okay.

205
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:00,550
Try backwards.

206
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:08,244
Welcome to The Vicious 6.

207
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:10,916
That's pretty...

208
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:23,947
Hello.

209
00:23:30,193 --> 00:23:32,345
Everybody here for the interview?

210
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,356
Me too.

211
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,526
So what do you guys
got going on later?

212
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:38,796
Are you up to no good?

213
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:41,084
Are you gonna get into some mischief?

214
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,135
Bring the first one in.

215
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:50,772
They're ready to see you Mr. Gru.

216
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:53,291
Oh, good good.

217
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,949
Distinguished villains,

218
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,216
My name is Gru.

219
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,010
I feel like I'm talking too loud,
even though our proximity

220
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,653
doesn't require this kind of volume.

221
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,723
If you told me when I was ten,

222
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,280
if I would have the chance to fill
the shoes of my favorite villain ever,

223
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,473
Wild Knuckles

224
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,900
I would say "you got
rocks in your head,"

225
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:00,393
but now that I'm 11 and 3/4
it makes a lot more sense.

226
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:03,256
All right, who let the kid in?

227
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,276
I thought he was this tiny man.

228
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,796
What's wrong with you?

229
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:12,896
You seriously think a puny little
child can be a villain.

230
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:16,428
Umm... Yes. I'm pretty despicable.

231
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:18,776
You don't want to cross me.

232
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,840
Evil is for adults,

233
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,100
who steal powerful ancient stones
and wreak havoc,

234
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:33,670
and not for tubby little pups
who should be at school learning

235
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,093
taking a recess.

236
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:37,206
Suck, I can't stop.

237
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:43,896
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

238
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:45,556
Who's next?

239
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,736
I am Wingman,
the next member of The Vicious 6.

240
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:55,076
Behold, the power of flight, Sir.

241
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,194
All right, joke's over.
Show time.

242
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:11,656
right

243
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,830
Bring him in. Bring him in, boys!

244
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,572
He took the stone.

245
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,018
Caught him!

246
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:45,056
Lock down the building.

247
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,566
I did... nothing to see here.

248
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,536
Oh, look at you. Frampton Comes Alive!
Nice choice.

249
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:05,265
I uh...

250
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,096
Just keep walking.

251
00:27:17,642 --> 00:27:19,516
Look at that. A kid?

252
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:23,816
Guys.

253
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:27,266
What are you doing here?

254
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:31,135
Okay. Just get on.

255
00:27:31,722 --> 00:27:34,026
-Which way did he go?
-There is that little thief.

256
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:54,556
-Knock knock. Delivery!

257
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,021
The demon child!

258
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:11,176
Otto, take the stone back to the lair.

259
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:12,076
I'll distract them.

260
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:25,530
No, not now. Come on, come on.

261
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,093
Yeah, baby.

262
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:51,819
I'll handle this.

263
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,588
Hope you enjoy the rest of your short life.

264
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:03,655
Please work.
Come on, come on, come on.

265
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:19,560
We're coming for you, tiny man!

266
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,225
They all said a kid wouldn't
be a real villain.

267
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:47,843
We-he-ell... This kid just stole something 
from the worst villains in the world.

268
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:53,276
When I bring it back to them,
they're going to say...

269
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,296
"We have made a terrible mistake."

270
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:58,676
"Please join us."

271
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,016
"Please Gru"
and I will say...

272
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:06,386
Yes! I will be the newest
member of The Vicious 6.

273
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:09,836
Now all I need is Otto.

274
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:11,595
Where is Otto?

275
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:15,976
No, not "Otto le komay"
He needs to come in now.

276
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:23,100
-Otto!
-Mini boss!

277
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,683
There you are...

278
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:26,616
You got it?

279
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:34,448
Is this... Are you pulling
on my legs right now?

280
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,948
Otto, where's the stone?

281
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:50,616
What about you?

282
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:20,086
Come up.

283
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:55,056
Did you just trade my future?

284
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:57,306
For a pet rock?!

285
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:01,913
Okay, I'll go...

286
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,953
Where was this birthday party?

287
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:11,159
This is unacceptable. Unacceptable!

288
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:14,973
I told you guys that you weren't
ready for the big leagues

289
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,663
and you have proven me correct.

290
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,866
All you do is mess everything up.

291
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,769
Ugh! What?!

292
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:31,586
My mom was right.

293
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:35,882
You do not belong here.
You're fired.

294
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:41,007
I'm going to find that stone.

295
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,505
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

296
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:47,406
And Otto, close your yapper!

297
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:54,886
I'll say goodbye.

298
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,736
No one ever cared if I should leave.

299
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:09,826
Kevin, no, I will be better
off on my own.

300
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:04,134
I'm sorry.
I thought you'll be impressed

301
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,296
Can I just speak to Belle Bottom?

302
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,836
Wild Knuckle!

303
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:16,946
You're alive?

304
00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:20,956
Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper.

305
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,650
This could be a great opportunity
if you don't kill me.

306
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,783
Shut up and give me the stone.

307
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:29,146
Ahh. Yes. The stone.

308
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:31,336
Here's the thing about that.

309
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:33,466
It's kind of a funny story.

310
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:34,596
Give it to him.

311
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:43,586
It's all going to go south very quickly.

312
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:47,986
What the heck is this?

313
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,226
Where is it, boy?

314
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:07,766
I don't have it,
I don't have it.

315
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:09,296
I know you're hiding
it somewhere.

316
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:12,298
I'm not, I'm not. I swear.
Cross my heart and hope to die.

317
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,626
Stick a needle in my eye.

318
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:15,136
Don't actually do that though.

319
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:16,636
Somebody bring me a phone.

320
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:22,540
Call home. It's ransom time.

321
00:35:22,618 --> 00:35:26,426
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me.

322
00:35:27,696 --> 00:35:29,266
Good one. Call!

323
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,146
Who is this?

324
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,026
Kevin lay what?

325
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,236
You kidding me?
You got henchmen?

326
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,870
Well, that's the end of that.

327
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,167

Say, you mind if we use the John...

Bank of Evil.

492
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:41,828
It's showtime, kid.

493
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,858
Follow my lead and 
don't forget your cue.

494
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:49,374
Hello I... I just need to cash this.

495
01:01:49,398 --> 01:01:52,248
Oh wowie zowie! What a big bank!

496
01:01:52,445 --> 01:01:54,828
How many security guards
are in here?

497
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:56,268
Who's this little guy?

498
01:01:56,505 --> 01:02:02,258
Well, that's my grandson who still has not learned
that children should be seen and not heard.

499
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:05,848
Haha, kids.
I actually have a son of my own.

500
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:08,568
Yeah, you look so weird.

501
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:10,547
Oh haha, don't listen to him.

502
01:02:10,642 --> 01:02:12,794
Your son is very uh...

503
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:13,868
cute.

504
01:02:20,305 --> 01:02:25,741
Help I'm seeing a white light.
Helen, I'm coming for you.

505
01:02:28,436 --> 01:02:31,248
Helen, I'm coming for you...

506
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:32,634
Oh... help!

507
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:35,370
Help my grandpa.

508
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:37,968
Somebody help him.

509
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:40,605
My grandpa!

510
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:43,998
This is the big one.

511
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:48,694
You hear that?

512
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:51,328
It's the sweet sound of angels.

513
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:58,303
Do something, my life
is flashing before my eyes.

514
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:14,278
No, no, no.
The other way, the other way.

515
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,478
All right.
Everyone stand back.

516
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:22,473
Uh-oh...

517
01:03:22,505 --> 01:03:23,528
-Clear.
-Wait a minute, wait.

518
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:28,998
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

519
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:30,828
No, no, no.
I'm feeling better.

520
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:31,749
Clear!

521
01:03:33,957 --> 01:03:35,246
Maximum charge.

522
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,068
Clear.

523
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,523
You saved my grandpa.

524
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:42,638
Did we... Did we do the heist?

525
01:03:43,498 --> 01:03:46,095
Grandpa say the darnest things.

526
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,146
You dropped this.

527
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:54,182
Look what I got.

528
01:03:54,255 --> 01:03:56,198
Hey, not bad.

529
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:57,398
Not bad at all.

530
01:03:57,515 --> 01:03:58,818
We make a good team.

531
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,895
Oh yeah, hey,
we got to keep at it.

532
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:05,005
Wait till you see what I'm
gonna teach you next.

533
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,141
I cannot wait.

534
01:04:07,258 --> 01:04:08,743
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

535
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:44,265
Time to strike.

536
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:17,149
They're not here.

537
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:18,678
Fan out and find them.

538
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:37,658
Something big is going
down in Frisco.

539
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:49,078
Whoo. There it is.

540
01:05:53,675 --> 01:05:55,228
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

541
01:05:58,085 --> 01:05:59,768
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

542
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:03,508
Hey, so welcome. Good luck.

543
01:06:26,935 --> 01:06:30,346
My friend, you're not gonna
learn from the old school.

544
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:31,557
Umm?

545
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:37,893
Oh no...

546

[WILD KNUCKLES FOUNDS THE VICIOUS SIX]

547
01:06:55,195 --> 01:06:57,638
I can't believe they did this to me.

548
01:06:58,274 --> 01:07:00,698
I... I taught them everything they know.

549
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:02,708
We were a team.

550
01:07:04,045 --> 01:07:04,428
Umm?

551
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:06,208
I give up.

552
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:10,277
Hey.

553
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:12,426
You are a great bad guy.

554
01:07:13,135 --> 01:07:14,789
They are stupid idiots.

555
01:07:15,382 --> 01:07:19,165
Only dream I ever had was
doing bad stuff with my buddies.

556
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:23,383
Now look at me, old... alone...

557
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:25,968
Well, you are old.

558
01:07:26,745 --> 01:07:27,958
But you're not alone.

559
01:07:31,565 --> 01:07:33,748
All right, listen up, buster.

560
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:38,462
We are starting a new team
and it's going to be called

561
01:07:38,552 --> 01:07:40,115
The Terrible Twos.

562
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:42,935
We can find a better name later,

563
01:07:43,002 --> 01:07:46,392
but right now we are going
to find that stone

564
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,145
and show everybody that you still got it.

565
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:53,455
Come on, you're just a little kid.
It's over.

566
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:55,813
-Go home.
-But you said we...

567
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,167
Go home!

568
01:08:45,262 --> 01:08:46,142
Otto?

569
01:08:58,443 --> 01:09:00,943
Otto!
Mini boss!

570
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:03,384
Mini boss!

571
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:14,948
You found the stone.

572
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,968
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

573
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:20,749
Hurry, we don't have much time.

574
01:09:20,845 --> 01:09:22,358
We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.

575
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:38,531
Long time no see, punk.

576
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,188
I'll take that.

577
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:55,744
Anti-Villain League. You are under arrest.

578
01:10:00,685 --> 01:10:05,338
Well, well, well, everybody...
Did you forget what time it is?

579
01:10:19,309 --> 01:10:21,438
Happy New Year!

580
01:10:26,614 --> 01:10:27,864
Fire!

581
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:51,298
Stand your ground.

582
01:11:06,323 --> 01:11:08,862
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, NO!

583
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:12,260
Where do you think you're going?

584
01:11:12,358 --> 01:11:16,772
You stole from us, 
and now you're gonna pay.

585
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:25,858
Enjoy being torn apart.

586
01:11:28,092 --> 01:11:29,242
Guys!

587
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,995
Oh...
Why don't we make this a fair fight?

588
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:45,827
Oh... You thought I was serious?

589
01:11:56,538 --> 01:11:58,567
Hello, traitors!

590
01:11:59,624 --> 01:12:01,428
Remember me?

591
01:12:02,964 --> 01:12:04,117
You?

592
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:06,098
You can leave me for dead,

593
01:12:06,167 --> 01:12:11,408
You destroy everything I own,
but I will not let you hurt that kid.

594
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,768
Oh...
So you're gonna save the kid?

595
01:12:14,116 --> 01:12:16,208
Yeah, you and what army?

596
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:21,018
Okay... this army.

597
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:27,188
Dig down deep.
Find your inner beast.

598
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:46,347
Otto.

599
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,730
Hurry! Faster!

600
01:15:31,002 --> 01:15:32,466
Get away from him.

601
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,361
Destroy the kid.

602
01:15:52,565 --> 01:15:53,990
No!

603
01:15:56,730 --> 01:16:00,773
How does it feel to be beaten
by the tiny little bug?

604
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:07,277
You guys were amazing.

605
01:16:07,302 --> 01:16:10,011
The Kung Fu,
where did that come from?

606
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:12,726
Obviously, you guys are re-hired.

607
01:16:43,936 --> 01:16:46,458
Oh, no. Wild Knuckles.

608
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:50,568
-Gru
-Hey

609
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:53,156
You're gonna be OK, right?

610
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:54,948
Don't worry about me, kid.

611
01:16:55,226 --> 01:16:56,858
I'll be fine.

612
01:16:57,355 --> 01:16:58,428
Finally.

613
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:02,042
You are going away
for a long, long time.

614
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,588
Yeah, well, I wouldn't bet on it.

615
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:06,898
No.

616
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,449
See you soon kiddo.

617
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:48,048
Wild Knuckles
was my favorite villain.

618
01:17:49,361 --> 01:17:54,628
We didn't have much time together,
but the time we did have...

619
01:17:54,947 --> 01:17:57,112
I'm so grateful for

620
01:17:57,544 --> 01:18:01,607
I've been thinking about how you
won't see me grow up or be there

621
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:05,279
for all the terrible things
that I'm going to do.

622
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:09,674
Believe me, 
they're gonna some awful things

623
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:21,398
But I'm going to make you proud.

624
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:26,548
I'm going to be the best villain
ever because of you.

625
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:32,958
Because you taught me what matters,
you can't do anything alone.

626
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:36,718
Find your tribe.

627
01:18:37,077 --> 01:18:40,202
And never ever let them go.

628
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,768
Otto.

629
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:30,388
You better stay out of trouble, kid.

630
01:19:30,662 --> 01:19:34,900
I will live a
good and honest life.

631
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:38,878
You're alive?

632
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,884
You just blew my mind.

633
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:45,598
How could you do that?

634
01:19:46,169 --> 01:19:50,701
I cannot wait to fake my own death
to avoid the authorities.

635
01:19:50,726 --> 01:19:54,138
Shoot for the moon, kid.
Shoot for the moon.

636
01:19:55,961 --> 01:19:58,158
See you later, suckers.

637
01:20:33,146 --> 01:20:43,420
I need a scientist who is very genius.
You want to work for me?

638
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:47,502
No, I am done with villainy
off the happier horizon.

639
01:20:48,693 --> 01:20:50,548
Goodbye, you old chap.

640
01:21:03,219 --> 01:21:08,420
Ohhh... All right, all right. Fine.
Stop with a face. I'm in.

641
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:11,252
Wanna see something cool?

642
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,311
Are you kidding me?

643
01:21:31,682 --> 01:21:33,966
Big boss, I like that.
