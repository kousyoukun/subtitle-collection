3
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,862
I'll never forget that summer.

4
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:56,896
I spent a week in the old house
where my mother grew up.

5
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:18,662
Almost there. Feeling all right?

6
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,065
Yes.

7
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:45,812
The Secret World of
Arrietty

8
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:56,552
Haru... How many times have I told her?

9
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:00,165
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

10
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:07,442
Haru!

11
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:10,416
You're blocking the driveway again.

12
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:39,209
Sho?

13
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:41,345
Where are you?

14
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,461
Don't touch!

15
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:02,606
These aren't for you.

16
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:25,872
- Arrietty!
- What?

17
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:28,939
You went outside again, didn't you?

18
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:32,547
And you might clean up this room,
young lady.

19
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,448
Is my own little garden.

20
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:38,255
If you ask me, it looks like a mess.

21
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,693
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

22
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:51,945
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early this year.

23
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,948
Enough for a whole year.

24
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,491
But the bay tree's so far away.

25
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:04,891
If a human saw you...

26
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,661
I'm always careful.

27
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:10,638
The world is full of
dangerous creatures.

28
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,976
Your great uncle...

29
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,678
Was eaten by a frog. Right?

30
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:19,719
Doesn't that perilla smell lovely?

31
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,659
Yes, it does.

32
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:26,224
With a bit of sugar,
I could make perilla juice.

33
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,868
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

34
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:37,878
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.

35
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:40,055
Papa's home.

36
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,129
Welcome back.

37
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,633
- Papa, about tonight...
- There's a boy in the house.

38
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,377
I saw him.

39
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:59,650
- No! Dear...
- I swear, he didn't see me at all!

40
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:04,923
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

41
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,790
I won't hear of it. Is too dangerous.

42
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:09,990
But, he's just a child!

43
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,999
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

44
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,342
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

45
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:19,280
I'll be fine!

46
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,482
Youngsters go to bed early.

47
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,027
Thank you, Papa!

48
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:29,697
But Pod...

49
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:33,132
The boy is sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

50
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:34,632
But still...

51
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:39,141
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

52
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,785
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

53
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:48,925
Someday she'll have to survive
without our help.

54
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:53,530
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

55
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:22,441
Whatever you need, just ask Haru.

56
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:23,703
All right.

57
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:25,875
Haru, I'm depending on you.

58
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,847
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:38,198
Les shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

60
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,664
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

61
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,810
I already decided!

62
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,714
I hope you can borrow
some tissue paper.

63
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,354
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

64
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,328
We could have perilla juice and sugar
for our tea.

65
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:46,094
But anything's just fine.

66
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:51,008
We'll be back soon.

67
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:52,974
Please be careful.

68
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:54,311
We will.

69
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,366
Arrietty!

70
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,427
Sorry!

71
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:30,253
- Hold these for me.
- Yes, Papa.

72
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:06,216
Hold on tight!

73
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,316
Arrietty?

74
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,714
Ready?

75
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,419
Everything's so huge!

76
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:25,120
The world of humans.

77
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,126
The sugar's over there.

78
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,834
Wait for me down there.

79
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,242
Papa, you're great!

80
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:48,836
Now les get that tissue.

81
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,236
Papa, look.

82
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,109
Your first borrowing.

83
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,621
Be careful, is sharp.

84
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,983
I will!

85
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,727
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

86
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:48,837
Look down there.

87
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:58,116
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

88
00:17:58,887 --> 00:17:59,946
I'm not afraid.

89
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,585
I'm ready for anything. I've got this!

90
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,859
Sometimes is best not to
go looking for danger.

91
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:56,835
What is this place?

92
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,742
The humans made it for their dolls.

93
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,561
Is just perfect for us!

94
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:15,794
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

95
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,699
These things aren't for borrowing.

96
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:21,035
If anything went missing,
they'd know right away.

97
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,038
Oh...

98
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,354
Don't be afraid.

99
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:05,963
I saw you.

100
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:10,970
In the garden. It was you, wasn't it?

101
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:20,210
My mother told me about you.

102
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:25,147
She saw little people here
when she was young.

103
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,555
Was it you that she saw?

104
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:33,395
Was it?

105
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:21,944
I'm sorry, Papa.

106
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:24,677
He saw me today, out in the garden.

107
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:28,686
I should have been more careful.

108
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,585
I hope he didn't frighten you.

109
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:36,592
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

110
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:38,103
All right.

111
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:49,111
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

112
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,368
We're home.

113
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,409
Safe and sound.

114
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,299
And?

115
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,661
Things didn't go well this time.

116
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:26,034
This light gave out before we finished.

117
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:28,305
Oh, dear.

118
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,042
We had to give up on the sugar.

119
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,048
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

120
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:41,394
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

121
00:24:50,714 --> 00:24:52,410
What a pretty pin.

122
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:57,483
Time for bed.

123
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,235
Good night.

124
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,680
She looks worn out.

125
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,412
Shall I make some tea?

126
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:51,150
Sho!

127
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,058
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

128
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:40,343
A cube of sugar? But whatever for?

129
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,255
He left it by the grating.

130
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:46,694
Is probably the same one
I dropped last night.

131
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:49,424
What?

132
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,265
What do you mean, you dropped it?

133
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:59,378
Don't touch it. Do you understand?

134
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,451
Is a trap.

135
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:07,816
They're trying to catch us!

136
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,557
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.

137
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:14,401
Maybe they already know where we are.

138
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,469
Pod, we'll have to move!

139
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:21,141
This was such a lovely house.

140
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:23,643
Now we'll have to start all over again.

141
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,484
Well, les see how things go.

142
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,819
Now eat, the soup is getting cold.

143
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:34,964
Why did it have to be sugar?

144
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,293
Thank you, Arrietty.

145
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:01,440
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

146
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:05,213
You know I love doing laundry.

147
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:13,888
- I'm going to nap for a bit.
- All right.

148
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,771
You forgot something

149
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:11,848
You came back.

150
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:16,655
Wait, don't go.

151
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,806
Please leave us alone.

152
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,743
I wanted to tell you that.

153
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:28,779
I want to talk to you.

154
00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:31,376
Humans are dangerous.

155
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:35,615
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

156
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:39,889
You have a family? I envy you.

157
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:43,136
Don't you have one?

158
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:47,240
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

159
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,246
Mother is so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

160
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,785
Really...

161
00:35:57,226 --> 00:36:00,355
My name's Sho. Whas your name?

162
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,131
Do you have one?

163
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:08,509
Of course I have a name!

164
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,343
Is Arrietty.

165
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,445
Arrietty. Arrietty.

166
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:17,350
Thas pretty.

167
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:37,177
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

168
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:46,632
Just a peek. Please?

169
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:40,783
Whas happening?
Oh, my gosh, is a crow!

170
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,796
You can't come in here!

171
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:07,783
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

172
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:11,028
Maybe is nesting season
or something.

173
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:19,872
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

174
00:38:20,109 --> 00:38:22,203
Are you all right?

175
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:26,376
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

176
00:38:26,987 --> 00:38:28,250
Thanks, Haru.

177
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,080
I feel fine.

178
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:40,499
Nesting season?

179
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:51,746
Have yourself a nice long rest now.

180
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:52,613
Papa...

181
00:39:54,987 --> 00:39:58,618
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.

182
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:01,688
I wanted to do something to help.

183
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,333
But he didn't see me.

184
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:08,672
You put your family in danger.

185
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:12,814
I won't say it again. Understand?

186
00:40:13,215 --> 00:40:14,183
Yes.

187
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,953
We'd better start looking.

188
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:27,214
We'd better start looking.

189
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:31,182
Is time.

190
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,656
Pod...

191
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,711
Afternoon! Package for you.

192
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:18,074
Thanks again ma'am.
Is pretty hot out there.

193
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:18,507
Thanks again ma'am.
Is pretty hot out there.

194
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,841
Listen, do you know any good
pest control companies?

195
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,779
Pest control?

196
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:29,718
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

197
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:33,588
"Squeaky Klean Service"?
Let me just write that down.

198
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:38,869
Having problems with mice?

199
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:43,713
Maybe is mice.
Or maybe is something else.

200
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:48,446
Between us, is little people.

201
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:50,288
I've seen them myself.

202
00:41:57,001 --> 00:42:00,233
A crow tried to fly into your room?

203
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:02,334
I hope it didn't scare you.

204
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:06,071
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

205
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,981
I was so astonished!

206
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:12,582
I never saw such a huge...

207
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:16,151
Excitemens the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

208
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,466
He came here for peace and quiet.

209
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:23,501
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

210
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,734
I know, I know.

211
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:31,352
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

212
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:34,546
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

213
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:39,353
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

214
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:42,030
I don't mind.

215
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,371
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped.

216
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:50,037
But why can't she be here
when he needs her so?

217
00:42:58,294 --> 00:43:01,787
Aunt Sadako,
who made that little house in my room?

218
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,533
Is amazing.

219
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:05,736
You mean the dollhouse?

220
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:09,066
That dollhouse belongs to your mother.

221
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:12,575
She left it here when she moved out.

222
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:13,850
It was hers?

223
00:43:14,618 --> 00:43:18,215
My father had it
custom-made in England.

224
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:20,960
It was for the little people.

225
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,399
My father claimed he'd seen them.

226
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:27,500
He waited for so many years.

227
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:32,772
He always said that house
was a present for them.

228
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:36,785
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

229
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,023
Not in my father's lifetime, nor in mine.

230
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:46,190
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

231
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:51,798
Unfortunately, no.

232
00:43:52,976 --> 00:43:56,004
Is been in our family
for four generations.

233
00:43:56,348 --> 00:44:00,480
If you like it, it will be yours someday.

234
00:44:00,688 --> 00:44:02,156
You mean it?

235
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:03,681
Yes.

236
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:08,626
Have you looked inside?
Is quite beautiful!

237
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:16,843
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:30,528
This is the living room.

239
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:35,533
All the furnishings were handmade
by a real furniture maker.

240
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:39,236
Isn't it wonderful?

241
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:44,754
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

242
00:44:45,423 --> 00:44:49,555
But the next room
is my personal favorite.

243
00:44:49,863 --> 00:44:52,389
Haru, could you open that up?

244
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:55,570
Les see, I think it opens this way.

245
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:02,041
Everything is so detailed!

246
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,583
Detailed and just like the real thing.

247
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:09,820
Thas a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

248
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,129
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

249
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:14,993
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

250
00:45:15,535 --> 00:45:16,833
And is been so long...

251
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:20,271
Maybe the little people are gone now.

252
00:47:41,143 --> 00:47:44,137
Mother,
we've had these pictures three years.

253
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:45,576
Don't you want new ones?

254
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:48,709
I love those pictures.

255
00:47:48,888 --> 00:47:52,849
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

256
00:47:53,762 --> 00:47:56,995
Besides, there's no point in
changing them now.

257
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:03,202
Papa's later than usual.

258
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,376
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

259
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:14,894
- Papa?
- Thas the back door.

260
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:20,227
Papa! Welcome back...

261
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:24,070
Twisted my leg.

262
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:26,506
Is lucky Spiller found me.

263
00:48:32,755 --> 00:48:33,916
Pod?

264
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:38,586
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.

265
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,135
Does it hurt?

266
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:45,599
Is not broken. I'll be fine in no time.

267
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:48,945
I'll get some cold water.

268
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:53,444
Here's a towel, better dry off.

269
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:55,919
Who's this?

270
00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:03,959
Is not just the three of us after all.

271
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:13,843
Gotta go.

272
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,747
Wait, at least stay and have some tea.

273
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:29,664
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

274
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:34,780
Thank you, Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

275
00:49:38,655 --> 00:49:40,681
We're so grateful for your help.

276
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,120
Listen, have you seen other Borrowers?

277
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,169
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

278
00:49:51,808 --> 00:49:52,935
This many.

279
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:56,613
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

280
00:49:58,252 --> 00:50:00,278
Can I see your bow?

281
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,399
You use this for hunting.

282
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,402
Give that back. Is not a toy.

283
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:33,764
Gotta go.

284
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:38,311
Won't you stay and have a bite?

285
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,775
Got this.

286
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:47,953
A crickes leg!

287
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,861
Want some? Is real good.

288
00:50:51,1000 --> 00:50:52,967
No thanks!

289
00:50:57,675 --> 00:50:58,642
Take care.

290
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:01,680
Thanks again.

291
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,148
I'll see him out.

292
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:16,161
You were looking for a new place.

293
00:51:17,171 --> 00:51:21,371
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

294
00:51:21,544 --> 00:51:23,172
Really...

295
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:26,742
His territory reaches past the river.

296
00:51:27,687 --> 00:51:31,557
And he knows a few
places where we could live.

297
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:34,458
Thas good I suppose.

298
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,865
I'd hate to camp out.

299
00:51:39,339 --> 00:51:43,003
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

300
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:50,718
I'm glad there are still others like us.

301
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:53,755
Do you have friends and family, Spiller?

302
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:57,159
Family? No, just me.

303
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:00,232
Well, I hope you can come again.

304
00:52:00,538 --> 00:52:03,565
My mother's stew
is the best in the world.

305
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,339
Haru?

306
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,965
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

307
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:33,702
Pull it apart and do it again.

308
00:53:35,748 --> 00:53:39,379
Why do we need such a big sack,
anyway?

309
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,899
I'm going to check in on Papa.

310
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:54,076
Papa, can I come in?

311
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,009
How's your leg?

312
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,412
I'll be walking soon.

313
00:54:01,188 --> 00:54:02,746
Papa?

314
00:54:04,927 --> 00:54:06,953
Are we going to move?

315
00:54:08,265 --> 00:54:11,759
We were seen.
We have no choice but to move.

316
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:19,372
I don't think every human is dangerous.

317
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:22,117
Arrietty...

318
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,950
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

319
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,126
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

320
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:32,459
The other one moved away.

321
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:34,664
They were seen by humans.

322
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:38,642
No matter what happens,
we have to survive.

323
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:40,811
Papa...

324
00:54:57,006 --> 00:55:00,774
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

325
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:26,576
Mother!

326
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:30,688
It won't open.

327
00:55:34,863 --> 00:55:36,833
The doorframe buckled.

328
00:55:57,431 --> 00:55:59,627
The wall!

329
00:56:36,189 --> 00:56:37,316
Homily!

330
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,591
Homily!

331
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:46,004
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

332
00:57:51,204 --> 00:57:53,639
Gather only what we need.

333
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,087
We can't carry all that.

334
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:07,954
And, Homily,
take nothing from the doll house.

335
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:12,135
I'll make sure is safe.

336
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:15,406
- Stay with your mother.
- Yes, Papa.

337
00:58:47,823 --> 00:58:49,348
You finally came.

338
00:58:59,407 --> 00:59:02,071
Do you like your new kitchen?

339
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:06,178
Our house is a disaster.

340
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:11,457
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

341
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:18,067
Can I look?

342
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,871
You're beautiful.

343
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:49,179
We have to move.

344
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:52,115
We were seen.

345
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,957
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

346
00:59:56,161 --> 00:59:57,459
Borrowers?

347
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,956
We borrow from humans.

348
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,566
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.

349
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:06,977
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

350
01:00:07,545 --> 01:00:10,709
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

351
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:14,319
No one ever saw them?

352
01:00:15,356 --> 01:00:16,323
Probably.

353
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:21,230
Is all my fault.

354
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:26,438
Niya, don't be like that. Be nice to her.

355
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:31,871
Are there other little people
like you in the house?

356
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:35,881
No, is just
my father and mother and me.

357
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:38,183
What about in other houses?

358
01:00:38,425 --> 01:00:42,193
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

359
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:43,921
Oh.

360
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:48,565
Soon you'll be the only one left.

361
01:00:50,243 --> 01:00:52,735
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

362
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:56,714
You're a doomed species, you know.

363
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,555
Thas not true!

364
01:01:00,826 --> 01:01:04,058
There are lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

365
01:01:04,698 --> 01:01:05,722
Spiller?

366
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:07,929
He's one of us.

367
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:11,407
And he said there are lots more.

368
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:17,473
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

369
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:21,581
There are 6.7 billion of us.

370
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:24,628
Six point seven billion?

371
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:26,692
What about you?

372
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,091
I don't know.

373
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:32,272
There's probably just a few of you.

374
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,601
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

375
01:01:38,816 --> 01:01:42,276
Lots of species are already extinct.

376
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:45,893
I've only seen them in books, though.

377
01:01:47,029 --> 01:01:49,430
So many beautiful species...

378
01:01:49,566 --> 01:01:53,265
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

379
01:01:53,739 --> 01:01:58,236
Is sad, but thas what fate
has in store for your kind.

380
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,382
Fate, you say?

381
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:06,648
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

382
01:02:08,095 --> 01:02:10,758
We have to survive.
Thas what Papa said.

383
01:02:11,299 --> 01:02:13,769
So we're leaving,
even though is dangerous.

384
01:02:14,604 --> 01:02:20,170
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

385
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,879
We're not going to die out that easily!

386
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:29,489
I'm sorry. You're right.

387
01:02:30,428 --> 01:02:32,796
I'm the one who's going to die.

388
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,804
Is my heart.

389
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:44,075
They're going to operate next week,
but is probably hopeless.

390
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:45,714
Your heart?

391
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:51,292
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

392
01:02:52,262 --> 01:02:56,564
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

393
01:02:56,835 --> 01:02:59,100
I can't even do that.

394
01:02:59,773 --> 01:03:02,140
I hope you can forgive me.

395
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,616
I didn't know you were so sick.

396
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,588
What in the world is this doing here?

397
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:03,563
Is the kitchen from the doll house!

398
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:21,864
Found you!

399
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:28,669
Whas wrong?

400
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:32,474
My mother... I heard her voice.

401
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:06,928
This really is a great kitchen.

402
01:05:07,534 --> 01:05:10,664
You're not the only little one here, I bet.

403
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:34,073
I have to go.

404
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:25,384
Let me out! Help me!

405
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:35,521
The ceiling's tilted.

406
01:09:01,924 --> 01:09:04,951
Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?

407
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,596
Can you make an urgent house call?

408
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,894
There's something small in the house.
No, not mice.

409
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:12,331
Not mice?

410
01:09:12,506 --> 01:09:14,668
I don't want them killed.

411
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:16,339
You need trapping services?

412
01:09:16,512 --> 01:09:19,642
Yes, thas it. I want you to trap them.

413
01:09:30,768 --> 01:09:32,259
Sho! Sho!

414
01:09:36,008 --> 01:09:37,169
Arrietty!

415
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:44,384
Mother's gone!

416
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:49,518
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human got her!

417
01:09:55,238 --> 01:09:56,967
Momma...

418
01:10:07,056 --> 01:10:08,580
We'll find her.

419
01:10:43,712 --> 01:10:45,271
Is locked.

420
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:51,721
Les try the room next door.

421
01:11:11,587 --> 01:11:12,646
It won't budge.

422
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:13,985
Wait!

423
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:25,341
I can fit.

424
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:01,864
Amazing!

425
01:12:37,451 --> 01:12:39,784
No, thas not it.

426
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,184
There's a dirt road. Turn in there.

427
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:47,527
- Before the bridge?
- No, not that one!

428
01:12:55,346 --> 01:12:57,679
Haru opened this.

429
01:12:58,183 --> 01:13:01,154
Then she must have
taken Mother someplace.

430
01:13:37,743 --> 01:13:39,233
Are you okay?

431
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:52,029
Whas taking them so long?

432
01:14:25,716 --> 01:14:28,379
Mother! Where are you?

433
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:46,811
But the lock...

434
01:14:47,215 --> 01:14:48,478
Lock?

435
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:53,187
Could I have some hot milk?

436
01:14:53,525 --> 01:14:56,155
Okay, wait just a minute.

437
01:15:05,577 --> 01:15:07,135
Thanks.

438
01:15:44,736 --> 01:15:48,333
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

439
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:55,916
Mother!

440
01:15:57,556 --> 01:15:58,989
Mother!

441
01:16:06,636 --> 01:16:09,129
- Mother?
- Arrietty!

442
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,481
Here I am, Arrietty!

443
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:19,947
Mother!

444
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:25,791
Arrietty!

445
01:16:52,706 --> 01:16:57,373
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

446
01:17:18,512 --> 01:17:20,538
Another human!

447
01:17:24,388 --> 01:17:26,050
Is all right, Mother.

448
01:17:49,326 --> 01:17:52,456
We'd like to take a look around first.

449
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:54,096
Take your time.

450
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:21,139
Now who can this be?

451
01:18:22,342 --> 01:18:24,504
Haru? Haru!

452
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,513
Whas going on here?

453
01:18:28,786 --> 01:18:32,519
Is finally happened.
The little people are here!

454
01:18:32,692 --> 01:18:34,023
Little people?

455
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:36,523
Thas right.

456
01:18:36,664 --> 01:18:39,225
And what little thieves they are!

457
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:54,349
Is really true.

458
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:01,668
They steal from all over the house.

459
01:19:01,769 --> 01:19:04,933
Thas why things were going missing.

460
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,941
Haru, whas gotten into you?

461
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:11,348
All these years I thought
it was my imagination.

462
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,386
Well, it wasn't.

463
01:19:14,154 --> 01:19:17,683
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

464
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:22,093
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

465
01:19:23,936 --> 01:19:26,133
You'll believe me when you see this.

466
01:19:26,907 --> 01:19:29,103
This is their nest.

467
01:19:30,947 --> 01:19:32,609
Nest?

468
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:41,258
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.

469
01:19:44,567 --> 01:19:47,402
What? I swear I saw it.

470
01:19:48,807 --> 01:19:51,710
Haru, I'm sending
the exterminators away.

471
01:19:51,979 --> 01:19:54,380
Now, wait just a minute.

472
01:19:55,784 --> 01:19:57,878
The dollhouse!

473
01:20:05,432 --> 01:20:08,403
Young Master?
May we come in for a minute?

474
01:20:08,738 --> 01:20:09,727
All right.

475
01:20:20,722 --> 01:20:24,558
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen, too.

476
01:20:26,164 --> 01:20:28,963
You'll see, is gone.

477
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,830
Is not gone.

478
01:20:34,076 --> 01:20:36,341
Such a pleasure to look at.

479
01:20:49,566 --> 01:20:53,368
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

480
01:20:56,377 --> 01:20:59,370
I wonder whas gotten into Haru.

481
01:20:59,915 --> 01:21:00,883
Oh?

482
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,381
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

483
01:21:20,446 --> 01:21:22,506
Someone was making tea!

484
01:21:24,552 --> 01:21:28,924
Is just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

485
01:21:32,164 --> 01:21:33,427
Yes, there are.

486
01:21:34,467 --> 01:21:36,903
So Haru really saw them.

487
01:21:37,072 --> 01:21:39,541
Though she accused them of stealing.

488
01:21:39,842 --> 01:21:43,280
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

489
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,951
I mean, I wish I could see them.

490
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:52,461
I bet they're here somewhere.

491
01:21:57,335 --> 01:21:59,464
I'm sure they are.

492
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:15,360
Excuse me, ma'am!

493
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,160
Where would you like us to start?

494
01:22:26,748 --> 01:22:28,512
Are you all right?

495
01:22:31,221 --> 01:22:33,190
It got away.

496
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:36,019
I had one and it got away!

497
01:22:36,362 --> 01:22:39,993
Is not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

498
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:43,396
Next time I swear I'll get them!

499
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:02,399
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

500
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:07,063
Is just outside the forest.
Then we head downriver.

501
01:23:08,444 --> 01:23:13,145
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

502
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:29,973
Les hurry.

503
01:23:31,278 --> 01:23:32,974
I can't do it...

504
01:23:59,521 --> 01:24:04,018
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

505
01:24:04,263 --> 01:24:05,230
What?

506
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:08,665
I'm so sorry.

507
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:14,333
Is my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

508
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:20,176
Thas in the past.

509
01:24:21,555 --> 01:24:25,357
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

510
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:33,362
I'm going outside for a bit.

511
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:36,707
Don't go too far now.

512
01:25:12,299 --> 01:25:13,426
Niya!

513
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:24,867
Niya...

514
01:26:43,938 --> 01:26:45,566
Just a little further.

515
01:27:08,476 --> 01:27:09,944
Spiller!

516
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,464
Thas everything.

517
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:29,774
Now les get moving.

518
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:31,338
Okay.

519
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:37,980
Mother, are you all right?

520
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:51,436
Arrietty!

521
01:28:21,854 --> 01:28:23,049
Sho!

522
01:28:27,095 --> 01:28:28,427
Arrietty...

523
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,758
We're leaving now.

524
01:28:54,804 --> 01:28:56,602
I'm glad I made it.

525
01:29:00,646 --> 01:29:02,774
Niya showed me the way.

526
01:29:10,461 --> 01:29:13,296
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

527
01:29:19,575 --> 01:29:21,009
I brought this.

528
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:30,321
I hope you'll accept it this time.

529
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,533
Thank you.

530
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:53,552
I have to go.

531
01:29:54,896 --> 01:29:56,694
When is your operation?

532
01:29:57,599 --> 01:29:59,033
The day after tomorrow.

533
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:03,704
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

534
01:30:12,289 --> 01:30:13,985
For luck.

535
01:30:18,965 --> 01:30:20,228
Thanks.

536
01:30:27,245 --> 01:30:29,737
You protected me after all.

537
01:30:31,952 --> 01:30:33,614
Arrietty...

538
01:30:35,991 --> 01:30:38,928
I hope you have the best life ever.

539
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,763
Goodbye.

540
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:51,271
Arrietty, you're a part of me now.

541
01:30:51,948 --> 01:30:54,942
I'll never forget you, ever.

542
01:34:31,043 --> 01:34:36,609
The End
