3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,345
I'll never forget that summer.

4
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,376
I spent a week in the old house
where my mother grew up.

5
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:19,131
Almost there. Feeling all right?

6
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:20,533
Yes.

7
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:46,267
The Secret World of
Arrietty

8
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,001
Haru... How many times have I told her?

9
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:00,612
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

10
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:07,886
Haru!

11
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:10,858
You're blocking the driveway again.

12
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:39,605
Sho?

13
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,740
Where are you?

14
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,815
Don't touch!

15
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,958
These aren't for you.

16
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,212
- Arrietty!
- What?

17
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:29,277
You went outside again, didn't you?

18
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,884
And you might clean up this room,
young lady.

19
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:34,784
Is my own little garden.

20
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:38,589
If you ask me, it looks like a mess.

21
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,025
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

22
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:52,271
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early this year.

23
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,271
Enough for a whole year.

24
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,812
But the bay tree's so far away.

25
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,211
If a human saw you...

26
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:06,980
I'm always careful.

27
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,955
The world is full of
dangerous creatures.

28
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:14,291
Your great uncle...

29
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:16,991
Was eaten by a frog. Right?

30
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,031
Doesn't that perilla smell lovely?

31
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,970
Yes, it does.

32
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,533
With a bit of sugar,
I could make perilla juice.

33
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,174
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

34
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,180
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.

35
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,356
Papa's home.

36
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:47,427
Welcome back.

37
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,927
- Papa, about tonight...
- There's a boy in the house.

38
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:56,670
I saw him.

39
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,941
- No! Dear...
- I swear, he didn't see me at all!

40
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,211
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

41
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:08,077
I won't hear of it. Is too dangerous.

42
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,276
But, he's just a child!

43
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,283
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

44
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,624
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

45
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,561
I'll be fine!

46
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,760
Youngsters go to bed early.

47
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,303
Thank you, Papa!

48
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:29,972
But Pod...

49
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,406
The boy is sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

50
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,905
But still...

51
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:39,411
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

52
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,053
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

53
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:49,190
Someday she'll have to survive
without our help.

54
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,793
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

55
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,689
Whatever you need, just ask Haru.

56
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:23,950
All right.

57
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,121
Haru, I'm depending on you.

58
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,092
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:38,438
Les shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

60
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:26,878
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

61
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:29,023
I already decided!

62
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:34,924
I hope you can borrow
some tissue paper.

63
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,563
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

64
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:41,535
We could have perilla juice and sugar
for our tea.

65
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,298
But anything's just fine.

66
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,210
We'll be back soon.

67
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:53,175
Please be careful.

68
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:54,511
We will.

69
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:27,549
Arrietty!

70
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:47,599
Sorry!

71
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,403
- Hold these for me.
- Yes, Papa.

72
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:06,347
Hold on tight!

73
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,422
Arrietty?

74
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:54,820
Ready?

75
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,479
Everything's so huge!

76
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,179
The world of humans.

77
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:27,184
The sugar's over there.

78
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,888
Wait for me down there.

79
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,271
Papa, you're great!

80
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:48,820
Now les get that tissue.

81
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:10,208
Papa, look.

82
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:14,079
Your first borrowing.

83
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,590
Be careful, is sharp.

84
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,951
I will!

85
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:41,683
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

86
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,789
Look down there.

87
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,063
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

88
00:17:58,834 --> 00:17:59,892
I'm not afraid.

89
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,529
I'm ready for anything. I've got this!

90
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:08,801
Sometimes is best not to
go looking for danger.

91
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:56,752
What is this place?

92
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:00,657
The humans made it for their dolls.

93
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,470
Is just perfect for us!

94
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:15,701
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

95
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:17,605
These things aren't for borrowing.

96
00:19:17,913 --> 00:19:20,939
If anything went missing,
they'd know right away.

97
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:22,941
Oh...

98
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,183
Don't be afraid.

99
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:05,781
I saw you.

100
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:10,785
In the garden. It was you, wasn't it?

101
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:20,021
My mother told me about you.

102
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:24,955
She saw little people here
when she was young.

103
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:29,361
Was it you that she saw?

104
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,199
Was it?

105
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:21,722
I'm sorry, Papa.

106
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,454
He saw me today, out in the garden.

107
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,461
I should have been more careful.

108
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,358
I hope he didn't frighten you.

109
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:36,363
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

110
00:23:36,906 --> 00:23:37,873
All right.

111
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:48,875
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

112
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:04,124
We're home.

113
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,164
Safe and sound.

114
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,047
And?

115
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,408
Things didn't go well this time.

116
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:25,779
This light gave out before we finished.

117
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,049
Oh, dear.

118
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:31,784
We had to give up on the sugar.

119
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:35,788
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

120
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:41,131
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

121
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,141
What a pretty pin.

122
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:57,212
Time for bed.

123
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:05,959
Good night.

124
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,400
She looks worn out.

125
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,131
Shall I make some tea?

126
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:50,788
Sho!

127
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:53,694
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

128
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,955
A cube of sugar? But whatever for?

129
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:42,866
He left it by the grating.

130
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:46,303
Is probably the same one
I dropped last night.

131
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,031
What?

132
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,871
What do you mean, you dropped it?

133
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,980
Don't touch it. Do you understand?

134
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,051
Is a trap.

135
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,414
They're trying to catch us!

136
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:11,153
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.

137
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:13,995
Maybe they already know where we are.

138
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:16,062
Pod, we'll have to move!

139
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,732
This was such a lovely house.

140
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:23,233
Now we'll have to start all over again.

141
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:28,071
Well, les see how things go.

142
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:30,405
Now eat, the soup is getting cold.

143
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,548
Why did it have to be sugar?

144
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:57,865
Thank you, Arrietty.

145
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:01,010
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

146
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:04,781
You know I love doing laundry.

147
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:13,451
- I'm going to nap for a bit.
- All right.

148
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:57,311
You forgot something

149
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:11,256
You came back.

150
00:35:14,468 --> 00:35:16,060
Wait, don't go.

151
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:22,208
Please leave us alone.

152
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,144
I wanted to tell you that.

153
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:28,178
I want to talk to you.

154
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,774
Humans are dangerous.

155
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:35,010
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

156
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,282
You have a family? I envy you.

157
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:42,528
Don't you have one?

158
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,629
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

159
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:50,633
Mother is so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

160
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,171
Really...

161
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,738
My name's Sho. Whas your name?

162
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,511
Do you have one?

163
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:07,887
Of course I have a name!

164
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:09,720
Is Arrietty.

165
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:13,820
Arrietty. Arrietty.

166
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:16,724
Thas pretty.

167
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:36,540
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

168
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:45,990
Just a peek. Please?

169
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:40,113
Whas happening?
Oh, my gosh, is a crow!

170
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:49,121
You can't come in here!

171
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:07,099
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

172
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:10,342
Maybe is nesting season
or something.

173
00:38:14,848 --> 00:38:19,182
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

174
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:21,512
Are you all right?

175
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:25,682
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

176
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,555
Thanks, Haru.

177
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:29,384
I feel fine.

178
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,798
Nesting season?

179
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,039
Have yourself a nice long rest now.

180
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:51,874
Papa...

181
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:57,876
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.

182
00:39:58,385 --> 00:40:00,945
I wanted to do something to help.

183
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,588
But he didn't see me.

184
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:07,925
You put your family in danger.

185
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:12,065
I won't say it again. Understand?

186
00:40:12,466 --> 00:40:13,433
Yes.

187
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:26,196
We'd better start looking.

188
00:40:26,196 --> 00:40:26,457
We'd better start looking.

189
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:30,423
Is time.

190
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:35,894
Pod...

191
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,931
Afternoon! Package for you.

192
00:41:14,445 --> 00:41:17,291
Thanks again ma'am.
Is pretty hot out there.

193
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:17,723
Thanks again ma'am.
Is pretty hot out there.

194
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:21,056
Listen, do you know any good
pest control companies?

195
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:22,993
Pest control?

196
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:28,929
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

197
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,797
"Squeaky Klean Service"?
Let me just write that down.

198
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,075
Having problems with mice?

199
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,916
Maybe is mice.
Or maybe is something else.

200
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:47,647
Between us, is little people.

201
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:49,488
I've seen them myself.

202
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:59,428
A crow tried to fly into your room?

203
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:01,528
I hope it didn't scare you.

204
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,263
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

205
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,171
I was so astonished!

206
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:11,770
I never saw such a huge...

207
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:15,337
Excitemens the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

208
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:18,651
He came here for peace and quiet.

209
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,684
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

210
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,915
I know, I know.

211
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:30,530
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

212
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,723
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

213
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:38,527
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

214
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:41,203
I don't mind.

215
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,542
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped.

216
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:49,206
But why can't she be here
when he needs her so?

217
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:00,950
Aunt Sadako,
who made that little house in my room?

218
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,695
Is amazing.

219
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:04,897
You mean the dollhouse?

220
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,225
That dollhouse belongs to your mother.

221
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:11,732
She left it here when she moved out.

222
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,006
It was hers?

223
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:17,369
My father had it
custom-made in England.

224
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:20,113
It was for the little people.

225
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,549
My father claimed he'd seen them.

226
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,649
He waited for so many years.

227
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:31,918
He always said that house
was a present for them.

228
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,929
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

229
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:40,165
Not in my father's lifetime, nor in mine.

230
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:45,329
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

231
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,934
Unfortunately, no.

232
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:55,138
Is been in our family
for four generations.

233
00:43:55,482 --> 00:43:59,612
If you like it, it will be yours someday.

234
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,287
You mean it?

235
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:02,811
Yes.

236
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:07,754
Have you looked inside?
Is quite beautiful!

237
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:15,966
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,644
This is the living room.

239
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:34,647
All the furnishings were handmade
by a real furniture maker.

240
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:38,348
Isn't it wonderful?

241
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,863
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

242
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:48,661
But the next room
is my personal favorite.

243
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:51,494
Haru, could you open that up?

244
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,673
Les see, I think it opens this way.

245
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,141
Everything is so detailed!

246
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:04,681
Detailed and just like the real thing.

247
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:08,916
Thas a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

248
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,224
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

249
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,086
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

250
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,925
And is been so long...

251
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,361
Maybe the little people are gone now.

252
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,152
Mother,
we've had these pictures three years.

253
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,590
Don't you want new ones?

254
00:47:45,231 --> 00:47:47,722
I love those pictures.

255
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:51,860
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

256
00:47:52,772 --> 00:47:56,003
Besides, there's no point in
changing them now.

257
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,207
Papa's later than usual.

258
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:06,379
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

259
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:13,893
- Papa?
- Thas the back door.

260
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:19,223
Papa! Welcome back...

261
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:23,064
Twisted my leg.

262
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:25,499
Is lucky Spiller found me.

263
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:32,905
Pod?

264
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:37,573
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.

265
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:41,120
Does it hurt?

266
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:44,582
Is not broken. I'll be fine in no time.

267
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:47,926
I'll get some cold water.

268
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:52,423
Here's a towel, better dry off.

269
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:54,897
Who's this?

270
00:48:59,873 --> 00:49:02,933
Is not just the three of us after all.

271
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:12,811
Gotta go.

272
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:15,714
Wait, at least stay and have some tea.

273
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:28,624
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

274
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,737
Thank you, Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

275
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,635
We're so grateful for your help.

276
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:43,073
Listen, have you seen other Borrowers?

277
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:47,119
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

278
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:51,883
This many.

279
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:55,559
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

280
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:59,222
Can I see your bow?

281
00:50:05,371 --> 00:50:07,339
You use this for hunting.

282
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:15,338
Give that back. Is not a toy.

283
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,691
Gotta go.

284
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,235
Won't you stay and have a bite?

285
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,697
Got this.

286
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:46,872
A crickes leg!

287
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:50,778
Want some? Is real good.

288
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:51,884
No thanks!

289
00:50:56,589 --> 00:50:57,556
Take care.

290
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,592
Thanks again.

291
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,057
I'll see him out.

292
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:15,066
You were looking for a new place.

293
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:20,273
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

294
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:22,073
Really...

295
00:51:22,615 --> 00:51:25,641
His territory reaches past the river.

296
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:30,454
And he knows a few
places where we could live.

297
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:33,353
Thas good I suppose.

298
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,758
I'd hate to camp out.

299
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:41,894
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

300
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:49,605
I'm glad there are still others like us.

301
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,640
Do you have friends and family, Spiller?

302
00:51:53,346 --> 00:51:56,042
Family? No, just me.

303
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:59,114
Well, I hope you can come again.

304
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:02,445
My mother's stew
is the best in the world.

305
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,184
Haru?

306
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:30,799
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

307
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:32,535
Pull it apart and do it again.

308
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:38,209
Why do we need such a big sack,
anyway?

309
00:53:45,925 --> 00:53:48,723
I'm going to check in on Papa.

310
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:52,898
Papa, can I come in?

311
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:56,829
How's your leg?

312
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,231
I'll be walking soon.

313
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:01,564
Papa?

314
00:54:03,743 --> 00:54:05,768
Are we going to move?

315
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,572
We were seen.
We have no choice but to move.

316
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,181
I don't think every human is dangerous.

317
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,924
Arrietty...

318
00:54:21,227 --> 00:54:25,755
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

319
00:54:26,165 --> 00:54:28,929
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

320
00:54:29,168 --> 00:54:31,261
The other one moved away.

321
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:33,465
They were seen by humans.

322
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:37,441
No matter what happens,
we have to survive.

323
00:54:38,244 --> 00:54:39,609
Papa...

324
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:59,561
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

325
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,350
Mother!

326
00:55:28,027 --> 00:55:29,460
It won't open.

327
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:35,601
The doorframe buckled.

328
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:58,384
The wall!

329
00:56:34,927 --> 00:56:36,053
Homily!

330
00:56:38,064 --> 00:56:39,326
Homily!

331
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,736
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

332
00:57:49,902 --> 00:57:52,336
Gather only what we need.

333
00:58:00,379 --> 00:58:02,779
We can't carry all that.

334
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:06,644
And, Homily,
take nothing from the doll house.

335
00:58:08,854 --> 00:58:10,822
I'll make sure is safe.

336
00:58:11,624 --> 00:58:14,092
- Stay with your mother.
- Yes, Papa.

337
00:58:46,492 --> 00:58:48,016
You finally came.

338
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,732
Do you like your new kitchen?

339
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:04,837
Our house is a disaster.

340
00:59:07,246 --> 00:59:10,113
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

341
00:59:15,321 --> 00:59:16,720
Can I look?

342
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,511
You're beautiful.

343
00:59:45,951 --> 00:59:47,816
We have to move.

344
00:59:49,021 --> 00:59:50,750
We were seen.

345
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:54,590
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

346
00:59:54,794 --> 00:59:56,091
Borrowers?

347
00:59:56,562 --> 00:59:58,587
We borrow from humans.

348
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:01,196
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.

349
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,604
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

350
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:09,335
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

351
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:12,943
No one ever saw them?

352
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:14,946
Probably.

353
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,850
Is all my fault.

354
01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:25,055
Niya, don't be like that. Be nice to her.

355
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:30,486
Are there other little people
like you in the house?

356
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,493
No, is just
my father and mother and me.

357
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,794
What about in other houses?

358
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:40,802
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

359
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,529
Oh.

360
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:47,171
Soon you'll be the only one left.

361
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:51,339
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

362
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:55,316
You're a doomed species, you know.

363
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,155
Thas not true!

364
01:00:59,425 --> 01:01:02,656
There are lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

365
01:01:03,295 --> 01:01:04,319
Spiller?

366
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,525
He's one of us.

367
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:10,001
And he said there are lots more.

368
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:16,064
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

369
01:01:18,043 --> 01:01:20,170
There are 6.7 billion of us.

370
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:23,215
Six point seven billion?

371
01:01:24,016 --> 01:01:25,278
What about you?

372
01:01:26,118 --> 01:01:27,676
I don't know.

373
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:30,855
There's probably just a few of you.

374
01:01:31,223 --> 01:01:35,182
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

375
01:01:37,396 --> 01:01:40,854
Lots of species are already extinct.

376
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:44,469
I've only seen them in books, though.

377
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:48,004
So many beautiful species...

378
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,837
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

379
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:56,805
Is sad, but thas what fate
has in store for your kind.

380
01:01:58,551 --> 01:01:59,950
Fate, you say?

381
01:02:00,753 --> 01:02:05,213
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

382
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:09,321
We have to survive.
Thas what Papa said.

383
01:02:09,862 --> 01:02:12,330
So we're leaving,
even though is dangerous.

384
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:18,728
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

385
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:22,435
We're not going to die out that easily!

386
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:28,042
I'm sorry. You're right.

387
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,347
I'm the one who's going to die.

388
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:38,352
Is my heart.

389
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:42,621
They're going to operate next week,
but is probably hopeless.

390
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:44,259
Your heart?

391
01:02:46,398 --> 01:02:49,834
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

392
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:55,103
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

393
01:02:55,374 --> 01:02:57,638
I can't even do that.

394
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,676
I hope you can forgive me.

395
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:05,150
I didn't know you were so sick.

396
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:32,108
What in the world is this doing here?

397
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:02,067
Is the kitchen from the doll house!

398
01:04:18,424 --> 01:04:20,358
Found you!

399
01:04:25,898 --> 01:04:27,160
Whas wrong?

400
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,963
My mother... I heard her voice.

401
01:05:02,134 --> 01:05:05,399
This really is a great kitchen.

402
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:09,133
You're not the only little one here, I bet.

403
01:05:31,563 --> 01:05:32,530
I have to go.

404
01:06:20,913 --> 01:06:23,814
Let me out! Help me!

405
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:33,914
The ceiling's tilted.

406
01:09:00,272 --> 01:09:03,298
Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?

407
01:09:03,575 --> 01:09:05,941
Can you make an urgent house call?

408
01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:09,238
There's something small in the house.
No, not mice.

409
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:10,674
Not mice?

410
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:13,010
I don't want them killed.

411
01:09:13,452 --> 01:09:14,680
You need trapping services?

412
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:17,981
Yes, thas it. I want you to trap them.

413
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:30,591
Sho! Sho!

414
01:09:34,339 --> 01:09:35,499
Arrietty!

415
01:09:41,413 --> 01:09:42,710
Mother's gone!

416
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:47,841
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human got her!

417
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:55,287
Momma...

418
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:06,894
We'll find her.

419
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:43,565
Is locked.

420
01:10:47,179 --> 01:10:50,012
Les try the room next door.

421
01:11:09,868 --> 01:11:10,926
It won't budge.

422
01:11:11,036 --> 01:11:12,264
Wait!

423
01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:23,614
I can fit.

424
01:11:59,151 --> 01:12:00,118
Amazing!

425
01:12:35,687 --> 01:12:38,019
No, thas not it.

426
01:12:38,924 --> 01:12:42,416
There's a dirt road. Turn in there.

427
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:45,758
- Before the bridge?
- No, not that one!

428
01:12:53,572 --> 01:12:55,904
Haru opened this.

429
01:12:56,408 --> 01:12:59,377
Then she must have
taken Mother someplace.

430
01:13:35,947 --> 01:13:37,437
Are you okay?

431
01:13:47,325 --> 01:13:50,226
Whas taking them so long?

432
01:14:23,895 --> 01:14:26,557
Mother! Where are you?

433
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:44,979
But the lock...

434
01:14:45,383 --> 01:14:46,645
Lock?

435
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,352
Could I have some hot milk?

436
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,318
Okay, wait just a minute.

437
01:15:03,735 --> 01:15:05,293
Thanks.

438
01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:46,469
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

439
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:54,048
Mother!

440
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:57,120
Mother!

441
01:16:04,763 --> 01:16:07,254
- Mother?
- Arrietty!

442
01:16:14,406 --> 01:16:16,601
Here I am, Arrietty!

443
01:16:16,975 --> 01:16:18,067
Mother!

444
01:16:22,213 --> 01:16:23,908
Arrietty!

445
01:16:50,809 --> 01:16:55,473
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

446
01:17:16,601 --> 01:17:18,626
Another human!

447
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:24,135
Is all right, Mother.

448
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:50,527
We'd like to take a look around first.

449
01:17:50,802 --> 01:17:52,167
Take your time.

450
01:18:16,795 --> 01:18:19,195
Now who can this be?

451
01:18:20,398 --> 01:18:22,559
Haru? Haru!

452
01:18:24,803 --> 01:18:26,566
Whas going on here?

453
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:30,569
Is finally happened.
The little people are here!

454
01:18:30,742 --> 01:18:32,073
Little people?

455
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:34,571
Thas right.

456
01:18:34,712 --> 01:18:37,272
And what little thieves they are!

457
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:52,388
Is really true.

458
01:18:57,769 --> 01:18:59,703
They steal from all over the house.

459
01:18:59,804 --> 01:19:02,967
Thas why things were going missing.

460
01:19:04,108 --> 01:19:05,973
Haru, whas gotten into you?

461
01:19:06,511 --> 01:19:09,378
All these years I thought
it was my imagination.

462
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:11,415
Well, it wasn't.

463
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:15,710
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

464
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:20,118
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

465
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,155
You'll believe me when you see this.

466
01:19:24,929 --> 01:19:27,124
This is their nest.

467
01:19:28,967 --> 01:19:30,628
Nest?

468
01:19:35,974 --> 01:19:39,273
It looks like a pile of old junk to me.

469
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:45,413
What? I swear I saw it.

470
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:49,719
Haru, I'm sending
the exterminators away.

471
01:19:49,988 --> 01:19:52,388
Now, wait just a minute.

472
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,884
The dollhouse!

473
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:06,403
Young Master?
May we come in for a minute?

474
01:20:06,738 --> 01:20:07,727
All right.

475
01:20:18,716 --> 01:20:22,550
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen, too.

476
01:20:24,155 --> 01:20:26,953
You'll see, is gone.

477
01:20:30,828 --> 01:20:31,817
Is not gone.

478
01:20:32,063 --> 01:20:34,327
Such a pleasure to look at.

479
01:20:47,545 --> 01:20:51,345
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

480
01:20:54,352 --> 01:20:57,344
I wonder whas gotten into Haru.

481
01:20:57,889 --> 01:20:58,856
Oh?

482
01:21:01,259 --> 01:21:03,352
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

483
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:20,468
Someone was making tea!

484
01:21:22,513 --> 01:21:26,882
Is just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

485
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:31,383
Yes, there are.

486
01:21:32,423 --> 01:21:34,857
So Haru really saw them.

487
01:21:35,026 --> 01:21:37,494
Though she accused them of stealing.

488
01:21:37,795 --> 01:21:41,231
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

489
01:21:43,101 --> 01:21:45,899
I mean, I wish I could see them.

490
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:50,407
I bet they're here somewhere.

491
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:57,406
I'm sure they are.

492
01:22:10,962 --> 01:22:13,294
Excuse me, ma'am!

493
01:22:13,898 --> 01:22:16,093
Where would you like us to start?

494
01:22:24,676 --> 01:22:26,439
Are you all right?

495
01:22:29,147 --> 01:22:31,115
It got away.

496
01:22:31,382 --> 01:22:33,942
I had one and it got away!

497
01:22:34,285 --> 01:22:37,914
Is not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

498
01:22:38,756 --> 01:22:41,316
Next time I swear I'll get them!

499
01:22:56,407 --> 01:23:00,309
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

500
01:23:01,512 --> 01:23:04,970
Is just outside the forest.
Then we head downriver.

501
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:11,049
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

502
01:23:26,571 --> 01:23:27,868
Les hurry.

503
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:30,868
I can't do it...

504
01:23:57,401 --> 01:24:01,895
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

505
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,107
What?

506
01:24:05,243 --> 01:24:06,540
I'm so sorry.

507
01:24:07,745 --> 01:24:12,205
Is my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

508
01:24:16,487 --> 01:24:18,045
Thas in the past.

509
01:24:19,423 --> 01:24:23,223
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

510
01:24:29,233 --> 01:24:31,224
I'm going outside for a bit.

511
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,567
Don't go too far now.

512
01:25:10,141 --> 01:25:11,267
Niya!

513
01:26:21,545 --> 01:26:22,671
Niya...

514
01:26:41,732 --> 01:26:43,359
Just a little further.

515
01:27:06,257 --> 01:27:07,724
Spiller!

516
01:27:22,473 --> 01:27:24,236
Thas everything.

517
01:27:25,576 --> 01:27:27,544
Now les get moving.

518
01:27:27,845 --> 01:27:29,107
Okay.

519
01:27:33,551 --> 01:27:35,746
Mother, are you all right?

520
01:27:47,898 --> 01:27:49,195
Arrietty!

521
01:28:19,597 --> 01:28:20,791
Sho!

522
01:28:24,835 --> 01:28:26,166
Arrietty...

523
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:47,486
We're leaving now.

524
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:54,327
I'm glad I made it.

525
01:28:58,369 --> 01:29:00,496
Niya showed me the way.

526
01:29:08,179 --> 01:29:11,012
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

527
01:29:17,288 --> 01:29:18,721
I brought this.

528
01:29:24,695 --> 01:29:28,028
I hope you'll accept it this time.

529
01:29:33,871 --> 01:29:35,236
Thank you.

530
01:29:49,086 --> 01:29:51,247
I have to go.

531
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,387
When is your operation?

532
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:56,725
The day after tomorrow.

533
01:29:57,094 --> 01:30:01,394
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

534
01:30:09,974 --> 01:30:11,669
For luck.

535
01:30:16,647 --> 01:30:17,909
Thanks.

536
01:30:24,922 --> 01:30:27,413
You protected me after all.

537
01:30:29,627 --> 01:30:31,288
Arrietty...

538
01:30:33,664 --> 01:30:36,599
I hope you have the best life ever.

539
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:40,432
Goodbye.

540
01:30:44,408 --> 01:30:48,936
Arrietty, you're a part of me now.

541
01:30:49,613 --> 01:30:52,605
I'll never forget you, ever.

542
01:34:28,593 --> 01:34:34,156
The End
