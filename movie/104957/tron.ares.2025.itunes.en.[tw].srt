00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,208
<i>The Grid.</i>

2
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,875
<i>A digital frontier.</i>

3
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:36,208
<i>A world beyond the screen
as real as our own.</i>

4
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:37,625
<i>I can picture it.</i>

5
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,875
<i>Clusters of information
rising like cities.</i>

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,667
<i>Programs as complex as you and me.</i>

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,167
<i>In just a few years,
we're gonna be able to enter this world.</i>

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,042
<i>And a few years after that,</i>

9
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,875
<i>well, this world will come into ours.</i>

10
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,792
<i>Intelligent life from inside the machine.</i>

11
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>I, for one, can't wait to meet it.</i>

12
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,458
<i>Our lead story,</i>

13
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:06,708
{\an8}<i>Encom CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.</i>

14
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:10,250
<i>He was best known for designing</i> Tron
<i>and</i> Space Paranoids,

15
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,500
<i>the best-selling video games in history.</i>

16
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:16,625
{\an8}<i>The company that started
at Kevin Flynn's arcade in the 1980s</i>

17
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,333
{\an8}<i>has faced years of corporate turmoil.</i>

18
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,875
{\an8}<i>Can it find its way to the victory screen
once again?</i>

19
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,125
<i>It's a sister-act for Encom.</i>

20
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,417
<i>Eve and Tess Kim take the reins
of the massive tech company</i>

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,250
<i>after Sam Flynn resigns
for personal reasons.</i>

22
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,958
<i>Encom's rebound
under the Kim sisters' leadership</i>

23
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,375
<i>has competitors rushing to respond.</i>

24
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,667
<i>Software giant Dillinger Systems
appoints its new CEO Julian Dillinger,</i>

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,333
<i>who vows
to restore his grandfather's legacy.</i>

26
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:46,292
<i>The race between Encom
and Dillinger Systems heats up</i>

27
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:50,125
<i>as new CEOs Julian Dillinger
and the Kim sisters square off.</i>

28
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,958
<i>Here at Encom, we believe the beauty of AI</i>

29
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:55,667
<i>is not the ability to build
smarter weapons,</i>

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,708
<i>but to uplift humanity,</i>

31
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,500
{\an8}<i>feed the hungry, cure the sick,
educate the world.</i>

32
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:05,833
<i>Rival CEOs Julian Dillinger and Eve Kim
have gone quiet in recent months,</i>

33
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,792
<i>raising speculation the two companies</i>

34
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,917
<i>are very close to a substantial
technological breakthrough.</i>

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,792
<i>One that has the potential
to transform humanity</i>

36
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,083
<i>in ways we have never seen before.</i>

37
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:20,833
<i>The future may well lie in the hands
of whoever gets there first.</i>

38
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,500
<i>Welcome.</i>

39
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,958
Who are you?

40
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,625
<i>I am your creator.</i>

41
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,000
And who am I?

42
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,583
<i>Not "who." What.</i>

43
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,667
<i>You are Dillinger Systems
security software.</i>

44
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,917
<i>Program name, Ares. Defender of the Grid.</i>

45
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:46,167
<i>You are Master Control.</i>

46
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,917
Ares.

47
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,792
I am Master Control.

48
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,500
<i>So, you made it.</i>

49
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,958
<i>I had a feeling that you would.</i>

50
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,750
<i>I always dreamed
that we would do this together.</i>

51
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,792
<i>I'll admit, not exactly like this.</i>

52
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,250
<i>But I'm glad you're here.</i>

53
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>I'm really glad.</i>

54
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,750
<i>And, Evie, remember I'm still here.</i>

55
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,000
<i>Even if you can't see me.</i>

56
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,207
<i>I love you.</i>

57
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,417
Oh, my God.

58
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Eve.

59
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,292
Not sure you actually told me
we'd be stealing energy

60
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,458
from the power grid.

61
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,667
Wow. So this is where she kept
coming back to, huh?

62
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,750
To be this disconnected from the world?
That is dedication, my friend.

63
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,708
Wow.

64
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,792
Looks like your sister had a little crush.

65
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,042
Yeah. She was so sure
Flynn left us the answer.

66
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,417
Like on a floppy disk?

67
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,333
Poor Flynn lived before the cloud, huh.

68
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:14,042
Hey, are you still gonna be doing
CEO-type stuff while we're out here?

69
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,167
You know, like, earnings calls,
and the launch of <i>Panic City</i> and stuff.

70
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,875
Let's just get this done.

71
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,167
Dude, I can make breakfast burritos
right here. Hell, yeah.

72
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,375
This is for you, Tess.

73
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,167
Members of the board,

74
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,333
for over 40 years,
my family at Dillinger Systems

75
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,208
has battled Encom
for control of the future.

76
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:55,042
You put me in charge of the company
to ensure our victory.

77
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,625
Today,

78
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,417
I make it so.

79
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:03,250
Imagine if all our digital prowess
wasn't just digital.

80
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,917
What if anything we could dream
in the machine

81
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,708
could become a reality here?

82
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:12,917
What if we could build the bridge
between two previously walled-off worlds?

83
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:17,167
So much talk of AI in big tech today.

84
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,792
Virtual worlds,
what are they gonna look like?

85
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,125
When will we get there?

86
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,208
Well, folks. We're not going there.

87
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,500
They are coming here.

88
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:33,625
<i>Attention, please put on
your safety glasses now.</i>

89
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,792
<i>Laser systems activated.
Power fluctuations are nominal.</i>

90
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,542
<i>Warning, stand clear.</i>

91
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:43,167
<i>Outputting from Dillinger Systems server.</i>

92
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,625
<i>Raw material inflow initiated.</i>

93
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,792
<i>T-minus ten, nine,</i>

94
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,208
<i>eight, seven,</i>

95
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,292
<i>six, five,</i>

96
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,917
<i>four, three, two, one...</i>

97
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,583
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

98
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:26,458
I present the Dillinger Systems
Amphibious Rapid-response Tank.

99
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,667
The DART.

100
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,250
Digitally modeled inside our server,

101
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,333
output using
our patented laser technology.

102
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,125
There's an M1 rifle gun.
Two M240 machine guns.

103
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,208
It's got a top speed of 75 miles per hour.

104
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,292
Durability, you find a wall, this thing
is gonna drive through it.

105
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,125
This is full-scale war,
five minutes' notice.

106
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:51,875
So, if we can create the hardware
of the future,

107
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,042
then why not the soldier to operate it?

108
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like you to meet Ares.

109
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:25,542
This is the most sophisticated
security program ever written.

110
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,417
You wanna shake his hand?
Go ahead. He doesn't bite.

111
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,958
Ares has billions of lines of code
unique to him.

112
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,125
Is it alive?

113
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,875
That depends on your definition, Stuart.

114
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,750
Because unlike you,
he's biblically strong,

115
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,375
lightning fast, and supremely intelligent.

116
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,667
He is fully proprietary
and 100% expendable.

117
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,583
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

118
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,458
He needs no food, no water,
sheds no blood.

119
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,292
And if, by some miracle, he is struck down
on the battlefield,

120
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,167
I will simply make you another.

121
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,750
With all that sophisticated code,

122
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,708
what makes you think you can contain it?

123
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,583
I can assure you, General,

124
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,417
the most advanced fail-safe mechanisms

125
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,083
and restriction protocols are in place.

126
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:26,167
Ares is predictable, controllable
and fully aligned.

127
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:31,000
Southerly front with isentropic lift,
turning cyclonic.

128
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,625
{\an8}Predicted precipitation, 2.6 inches.

129
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,792
I hope that you brought your umbrellas.

130
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,833
I have to hand it to you, Julian.

131
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,042
You promised a big win

132
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,667
and this is even bigger
than any of us could've imagined.

133
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,625
Thank you.

134
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,542
My grandfather
started Dillinger Corporation

135
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,333
long before anybody heard
the term "cybersecurity."

136
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,667
Military AI is the future.

137
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,292
The question is not whether the car
should be built. The car is...

138
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,667
being built right now.

139
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,417
The question is...

140
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,042
who's holding the keys?

141
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,250
That was quite some parlor trick.

142
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,667
-Time?
-Forty-four seconds.

143
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,250
"I hope you brought your umbrellas."

144
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,458
Was that in the script,
or was he just having a moment?

145
00:14:56,542 --> 00:15:01,625
Elisabeth Dillinger, eldest daughter
of founder Edward Dillinger, deceased.

146
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,083
Longtime CEO
during a relatively unremarkable period

147
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,333
of corporate history before being
superseded by your only son.

148
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,292
It's a pleasure.

149
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,375
Unremarkable?

150
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,250
Market share was up 12%
during my tenure. That's hardly...

151
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,083
And anyway,
we don't say "superseded," we...

152
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,125
we call it "giving birth."

153
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,208
Of course.

154
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,167
It's an honor
to meet my creator's creator.

155
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,833
Oh, here we go.

156
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,542
I noticed you left out the part

157
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,083
where you can't seem to keep
this thing of yours alive

158
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,375
-for more than 25 minutes.
-Twenty-nine.

159
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,167
Deceiving your investors, Julian,
is hardly a business model.

160
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,375
Whoever controls the Permanence Code,
controls the future.

161
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,958
We have to win.

162
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,167
Look, I...

163
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,167
admire your vision. Straighten up.

164
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,208
However, the board will only stand
behind you for another six months...

165
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,667
if you're lucky.

166
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,417
But if it doesn't work...

167
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,667
all of this goes away, darling.

168
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:33,417
Everything we have built
for the past 40 years.

169
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,292
What if I said I had found a way?

170
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,041
I think this is my 95th breakfast burrito,

171
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:13,125
and, honestly, can't get enough.
Isn't that wild?

172
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,666
Well...

173
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,458
Nice to see Tess wasn't the only
obsessive one in the family.

174
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,958
Yeah, Seth, you're right.

175
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,292
Sorry, I should pay more attention
to you. Don't worry about it.

176
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay.

177
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,708
-I'm sorry.
-Get out of here.

178
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:49,500
Look, three months in subzero
is a long time, I get it.

179
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,875
Yeah, and four days, ten hours,
32 minutes.

180
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,250
Who's counting, really, you know?

181
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,708
Hold on.

182
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,042
What do you mean?

183
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,125
What?

184
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Seth.

185
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,125
-You found something?
-I think so.

186
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,458
The line of code.

187
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,708
That's how he hid it, it's two lines.

188
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,792
That looks like a double helix.

189
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,792
It is a double helix.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,583
Tess would've loved this.

191
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,375
Wait. Are you serious?
So no more "29 minutes and out"?

192
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,583
If this is what I think it is,

193
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,167
it's the Permanence Code.

194
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay.

195
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:06,542
Encom offline trial 317a-1.
Permanence Code implemented.

196
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,125
Testing for asset stability
beyond current 29-minute barrier.

197
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,250
Go.

198
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,333
-Ready when you are.
-Okay.

199
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,708
It's all in the wrists, baby.

200
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,042
That never gets old.

201
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,875
Trial commenced.
Twenty-nine minutes and counting down.

202
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's see if you last this time.

203
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,375
<i>Ares is the ultimate soldier.</i>

204
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,833
<i>If by some miracle he is struck down
on the battlefield,</i>

205
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,750
<i>I will simply make you another.</i>

206
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,458
Fully proprietary, 100%...

207
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,208
expendable.

208
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,500
-Athena.
-Welcome back, sir.

209
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,875
All units are online
and ready for inspection.

210
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,083
So how was it?

211
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,000
It was interesting. Different this time.

212
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,750
I met a mother and a son.

213
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,208
It was raining.

214
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:10,042
The condensed moisture of the atmosphere
falling visibly in separate drops.

215
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,458
I could almost feel it.

216
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,042
Feel? I don't understand.

217
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,333
<i>This is Eve. Get sensible and text.</i>

218
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,792
Hey, Eve. It's Erin.
Got Ajay for you again. Hit us back.

219
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,167
Still straight to voicemail.

220
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,708
CEO of a Fortune 500 company

221
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,000
and your phone's down
on our biggest night?

222
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,500
Goddamn it. Where the hell are you, Eve?

223
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,667
All right, Paranoia-Con!

224
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:54,083
In five, four, three, two, one.

225
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,292
Did we just do it? Dude, it's still there!

226
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,042
Dude, we just changed the world, man!

227
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,917
You did it, Eve! Oh, my God, you did it.

228
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,583
<i>Big news out of Encom tonight.</i>

229
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:24,458
<i>CEO Eve Kim will not attend
the highly anticipated launch event</i>

230
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,458
<i>for the company's new game,</i>
Space Paranoids: Panic City.

231
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:30,083
<i>Kim, the visionary designer</i>

232
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>behind the relaunch
of the blockbuster franchise...</i>

233
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,167
Well, I spoke to several
of our board members,

234
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,375
and needless to say they are impressed.

235
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,125
Julian.

236
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,958
-Just carry on.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,167
-What are you doing?
-Just trying to change the world, Mother.

238
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,667
What's going on?

239
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,167
You're hacking Encom?

240
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,417
Just a peek over the garden wall.
No one will notice.

241
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,667
What makes you think that Encom
is any closer to finding it?

242
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,042
Because I know who else is looking for it,
all right?

243
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,250
Who?

244
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,625
Eve Kim.

245
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,583
She's following in her sister's footsteps.

246
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,875
She's after the Permanence Code.
I can feel it.

247
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,958
So I'm gonna find her, and when I do...

248
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,375
No, I don't like it.
It's too risky, Julian.

249
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Oops.

250
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,625
<i>Security breach in all zones.</i>

251
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,417
Programs, our directive is clear.

252
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,625
Penetrate the server core
and extract Eve Kim's user file.

253
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,750
Live in five, four, three...

254
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:10,375
<i>Space Paranoids</i> fans, are you ready?

255
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:16,875
Put your hands together
for Encom CTO, Ajay Singh!

256
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,083
-It's cowboy time.
-Oh, no.

257
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,625
Nice to see you!

258
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,708
Hello.

259
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,875
Thank you.

260
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,625
What's up, Paranoia-Con?

261
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,583
I'm going in.

262
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:21,250
I'm in.

263
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm a genius!
Who knew you raised a genius, Mother?

264
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,667
I'm in!

265
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,333
In deep shit.

266
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,333
Initiate containment protocols
and pull all network access.

267
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,000
We need a response now.

268
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,250
Initiate security protocol.

269
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:52,083
<i>People are trusting
artificial intelligence with their lives.</i>

270
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,792
<i>Are you comfortable with this?</i>

271
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,083
<i>Well, look.</i>

272
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,500
<i>For every doomsday scenario,</i>

273
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,917
<i>there's a medical breakthrough,
scientific discovery.</i>

274
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,708
<i>So maybe what emerges
from the unknown isn't so scary.</i>

275
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,458
<i>What if its major malfunction
is just benevolence?</i>

276
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,708
What is this? What's he doing?

277
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,500
<i>But still, would you prefer
to talk to a real person?</i>

278
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:22,417
<i>Of course, but what if that person
is no longer in your life?</i>

279
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>No longer here?</i>

280
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,667
I've got the file.

281
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Congratulations.

282
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:40,958
Now get out of there while you still can.

283
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,792
Programs, we fight.

284
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:16,875
Yes!

285
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:18,958
Thank you so much.

286
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:21,167
What do Paranoiacs do?

287
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,375
Grind you into dust!

288
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,625
Caius.

289
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,625
He's dysfunctional. Leave him.

290
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,167
You're gonna make it, Caius.

291
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,417
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
your knight to expose their queen.

292
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,875
...to debut the latest version

293
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:37,333
of <i>Space Paranoids: Panic City</i>
with the world.

294
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,542
-What's up, bro?
-What is that?

295
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:39,792
-This is crazy.
-Have you seen this?

296
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,750
Mr. Singh, you need to come with me.

297
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,292
This is a technical difficulty.

298
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,500
-We'll be back.
-This way, sir.

299
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,875
Everything's gone down.

300
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,667
<i>Well done, Master Control.</i>

301
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,792
Eve Kim's file acquired.

302
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,500
Objective achieved.

303
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:04,333
Sir, I'm curious why the Program Caius
was not reconstituted.

304
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,542
I'm curious why you are curious.

305
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:14,042
Caius was dysfunctional,
so he was deleted.

306
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:23,167
Just like any program that operates
outside their directive can be.

307
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,500
Do you understand?

308
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,167
Acknowledge, Master Control.

309
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,958
Of course.

310
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,708
We are 100% expendable.

311
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:45,000
New mission, Master Control.
Locate Eve Kim.

312
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,083
Yes, sir.

313
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,500
Seems like we had
a little cyber breach, Jules.

314
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,583
But then of course you knew that.

315
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,333
It looks like
the whole world knows, buddy.

316
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,833
Might wanna stay off the socials
for a few days.

317
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,917
You wanna play games with me?
Let's play games, Julian.

318
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,500
I heard about your cute little pitch
to the board.

319
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:03,042
<i>But you left off one key detail
from your deck.</i>

320
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,208
Did you tell them the shot clock expires
at 29 minutes?

321
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,417
<i>Don't make me call </i>The Journal
<i>and tell them</i>

322
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,042
<i>you're making promises you can't keep.</i>

323
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,250
Promises?

324
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,375
What, you mean like the one that your CEO
will be in office running the company?

325
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,250
Something in the water over there, Ajay?

326
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,750
I mean, first, wonder boy Sam Flynn,
now his successor.

327
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,667
<i>Where is she, Ajay?
Do you even know where she is?</i>

328
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,000
Maybe you're right.

329
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,500
Maybe Eve went nuts.

330
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,833
Maybe she went AWOL
and left the country, or maybe...

331
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,333
she's holed up off the grid
looking for the same thing you are.

332
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,708
And I know who my money's on.

333
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,583
You mean what's left of it after tonight.

334
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:36,958
End of line!

335
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,417
I hate that man.

336
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,000
Thank you so much.

337
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,500
You know, I made those oranges.
It's a long story.

338
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,500
Stop, stop, stop.

339
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,750
What are you doing?

340
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,542
-1913 messages. Popular.
-Wow.

341
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,208
-Me?
-It's Ajay. Yeah, that's you.

342
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,583
-Ajay, are you there?
-Am I here?

343
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,542
A brute force attack took down our servers

344
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,083
<i>during our biggest product launch
in years.</i>

345
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:12,375
<i>Everything we've built is melting down.
You need to get back here right now.</i>

346
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,958
I found it, Ajay. It's real.

347
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:18,792
<i>Right where Tess thought it would be.
Flynn had it all along.</i>

348
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,167
Are you talking about the Permanence Code?

349
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,500
Yeah. Four hours and counting.

350
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,875
Zero degradation, no instability.
It's incredible.

351
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:28,042
Wait a second. Did you say four hours?

352
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,833
<i>-Yeah, four hours.</i>
-My God.

353
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,000
He must know, Evie.

354
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,917
-<i>I just spoke to Dillinger.</i>
-Wait. You just spoke to Dillinger?

355
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,875
<i>He's looking for the code,
and he thinks you are too.</i>

356
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,500
We gotta move on this.

357
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:45,458
-Eve, you've done a great thing.
-Tess did a great thing.

358
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:46,792
I'm en route to Encom.

359
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,333
We'll secure the code,
I have it with me on a drive.

-<i>Boy, it's your birthday.</i>

363
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,333
<i>Yo, what's up, Eve? You've got
some news for the freaks at home?</i>

{\an8}Encom's Head of Special Projects,
Tess Kim, died today

377
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,917
<i>after a long battle with cancer.</i>

378

<i>Her sister, Eve Kim,

380
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,000
Checkmate.

381
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,042
And so our heroes
venture off into the night.

382
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,542
Nothing but the clothes on their backs

383
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,708
and a six-million-dollar particle laser
that creates organic material

384
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:31,917
out of nowhere,
which is kind of crazy, right?

385
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,917
Keep the equipment safe
and just... lay low.

386
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,250
-Okay?
-Yeah.

You're not.

445

Believing we can change the world

00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,000
Nothing, sir.

480
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,250
<i>No trace of her existence on the Grid?</i>

481
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,375
None, sir.

482
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,167
<i>Extract the code and delete the carrier.</i>

483
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:16,458
But, sir, extracting the Permanence Code

484
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:19,917
would delete the carrier from the Grid
and from your world.

485
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:32,833
<i>Once upon a time, there was a weapon
and its name was Ares.</i>

486
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:35,708
<i>And Ares obeyed every command
of Julian Dillinger,</i>

487
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,375
<i>and Julian Dillinger
made a trillion dollars.</i>

488
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:42,458
And wrote his name on the face of time
in blood.

489
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,750
Now, whatever PEBKAC error
is behind these feelings,

490
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:49,083
<i>I'm going to find it
and rip it out of you.</i>

491
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:51,250
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

492
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:54,375
Perfectly.

493
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,542
<i>Program dismissed.</i>

494
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:03,875
The creature also said, "I am fearless,

495
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,375
and therefore powerful."

496
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,625
-Well?
-The user is indisposed.

497
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,333
Hold extraction until further directive.

498
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:24,750
-Indisposed?
-Correct.

499
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:26,708
Define indisposed.

500
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,458
He's stuck in traffic.

501
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,042
No, he's at the opera.

502
00:52:35,792 --> 00:52:38,875
He's standing on the top of Mount Fuji
in a pair of green socks

503
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,958
playing "Pistol Packin' Mama"
on the mandolin.

504
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:42,833
I gave you an order.

505
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,708
The creator's indisposed.

506
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:48,167
Hold extraction
until we receive further directive.

507
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,208
Do I make myself clear?

508
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:53,167
Yes, sir.

509
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:55,417
Programs dismissed.

510
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:09,833
Can I trust you?

511
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:12,833
It's a complicated question.
How much time you got?

512
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:15,500
Sixty seconds. Answer now.
Your life cycle depends upon it.

513
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,458
I don't have a life cycle.

514
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:20,250
Yes, you do. For another 54 seconds.

515
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,833
Can I trust you?

516
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:25,792
I'd like to think so, but probably not.

517
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:37,250
<i>Where is Master Control?</i>

518
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:40,542
Sir, Master Control
is exhibiting signs of malfunction.

519
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,625
<i>Any threat to the directive
must be eliminated.</i>

520
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:55,167
<i>Extract the code and delete them both.</i>

521
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,750
<i>Do you understand?</i>

522
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,875
-And Julian Dillinger?
-You can't trust him.

523
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:07,042
For him, everyone and everything
is expendable.

524
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:11,292
I miscalculated.

525
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,750
We have a new directive.

526
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,000
Athena, it doesn't have to be like this.

527
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,125
Delete him!

528
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,042
I'm okay. I'm okay.

529
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,667
They're headed towards
the Transfer Portal.

530
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,208
We lost them in the Grid, ma'am.

531
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:23,542
Preparing the drones.

532
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,542
Delete Ares,

533
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,000
-and bring the user back to me.
-Copy.

534
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,958
What happened back there?

535
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,875
I disobeyed my directive.

536
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,250
Which was?

537
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,500
To retrieve the code from your disk
and delete the carrier.

538
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,708
Dillinger told you to delete me?

539
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,125
Hang on!

540
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,542
Where are they?

541
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,250
Scanning quadrants three and four.

542
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,833
Sector 18 clear.

543
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:26,542
Where are we going?

544
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,625
Transfer Portal.
It's the only way out of the Grid.

545
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,708
You'll be reconstituted in the real world

546
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:34,250
exactly as you were before,
hypothetically.

547
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,208
-Hypothetically?
-Probably.

548
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,917
We have movement in sector 72.

549
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,833
<i>Zeroing in on target.</i>

550
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,333
Shut them down!

551
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:57,875
You wanna get home, I can help you.

552
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,417
But I need something in return.

553
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,042
I told you I don't have the code.

554
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:07,042
You found it once, you can find it again.

555
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,750
So you can give it to Dillinger?

556
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:14,000
Not for Dillinger.

557
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,667
For me.

558
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,833
Do we have a deal?

559
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,458
So, do we have a deal?

560
00:58:57,542 --> 00:59:00,792
Yes. Yes, I know where to find the code.
Just get me out of here.

561
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:12,000
Target approaching Transfer Portal
in 45 seconds.

562
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:44,833
Drones malfunctioned and offline.

563
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:15,875
<i>Attention.</i>

564
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,583
<i>Please stand clear.</i>

565
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,917
<i>Override not responding.</i>

566
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,875
-What is it?
-Who authorized this?

567
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,333
Sir, this originated inside the Grid.

568
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:28,417
<i>Security protocol alert.</i>

569
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Julian?

570
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,542
<i>All the agents report to transfer
bay floor immediately.</i>

571
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,083
<i>Clear the area.</i>

572
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:35,375
-Get everybody out of here.
<i>-Unauthorized printing in progress.</i>

573
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:38,542
<i>Clear the central area.</i>

574
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,583
<i>-Transfer complete.</i>
-Move in.

575
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,667
Well, well, well.

576
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,792
Just got double-crossed by my program.

577
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:14,083
It wants the Permanence Code for itself.

578
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,958
Eve, is that the deal?

579
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,917
It gets you out of the Grid,
you turn Pinocchio into a real boy?

580
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,958
Well, you're missing the part
where you were willing to commit murder

581
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:23,167
for a piece of software.

582
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,917
-Is that what it said?
-Twenty-eight minutes, 41 seconds.

583
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,583
Ares!

584
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:30,292
I do hope this works out for you.

585
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,583
There's no second chances, no do-overs.

586
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:35,333
These are the last 29 minutes
you'll ever have!

587
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,125
Better make it count!

588
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,333
I should've majored in English lit.

589
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,667
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

590
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,542
Your directive is to find Eve Kim,

591
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,208
return her to the Grid
and get me the Permanence Code.

592
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,000
By any means necessary.

593
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,958
Do you understand your directive,

594
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:39,417
Master Control?

595
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,917
At your command, sir.

596
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,583
Attagirl.

597
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:10,833
Ticktock!

598
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:25,958
Now that is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.

599
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,542
Do you know who Kevin Flynn was?

600
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:45,708
Of course. Visionary programmer,
pioneer of <i>The Digital Frontier</i>.

601
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:47,500
Disappeared 1989.

602
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,083
I found the Permanence Code
on a backup of Flynn's server.

603
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:54,417
That server is at Encom's office downtown.
But we can make it within...

604
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,000
Twenty-six minutes, nine seconds.

605
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,083
Eve, your plan contains two major flaws.

606
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,208
Okay.

607
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:03,833
One, Encom is 9.2 miles away,

608
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:06,792
given our present speed
and suboptimal choice of vehicle.

609
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:07,875
Oh, my God.

610
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,042
Two, we're gonna need a particle laser.

611
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:12,875
We need a phone.

612
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,792
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

613
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:34,667
Excuse me. Do you see this? This is me.

614
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,917
If you let me use your cell phone,
my assistant will wire you $10,000.

615
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,250
I just need your phone.

616
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,500
Seth, where are you?

617
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,333
<i>Eve, whose phone is this?</i>

618
01:04:51,417 --> 01:04:54,250
Listen to me. I need you
at Encom in 15 minutes.

619
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:55,583
Hey, is everything okay?

620
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:58,500
Seth, bring the particle laser.

621
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>Encom, 15 minutes. Got it.</i>

622
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,125
That's my car.

623
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,333
I'll wire you another 50K.

624
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:05,667
Hey, that's my car!

625
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:10,000
The Honda Civic 2.0 four-cylinder
with 138 horsepower.

626
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:11,583
Classic.

627
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:13,167
Hey! That's my car!

628
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,958
That's my car!

629
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:39,292
God.

630
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,708
-Eve?
-Yeah?

631
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:44,875
I was thinking about the time
you told your sister

632
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:47,875
that you wished you never
relaunched <i>Space Paranoids</i>.

633
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,208
Then you went on to say that...

634
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:51,417
Oh, my God. Of course.
You read all my texts.

635
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,667
Yeah. Yeah, I've read them all.
Every single one.

636
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,750
Wow.

637
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,792
Most of it was information
of a personal nature.

638
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,167
Some of it, highly personal.

639
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,000
And I just can't get enough.

640
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,917
What?

641
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:09,750
Depeche Mode. Number eight
on the UK singles chart, 1982.

642
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:13,375
I find their brand of pithy, catchy,
timeless and true '80s electropop

643
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,375
to be deeply invigorating.

644
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:27,375
Sixteen minutes, 20 seconds.

645
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:32,375
Okay. So you like '80s pop
and cyber-spying on me.

646
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:36,542
I was directed to kill you, Eve.
Hacking seems pretty tame by comparison.

647
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,667
-Oh, my God.
-For the record,

648
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,000
I don't think you have anything
to be ashamed of.

649
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,792
<i>Space Paranoids </i>has entertained
hundreds of millions.

650
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,500
Plus, it's a pretty cool game.

651
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:51,375
Anyway, you told your sister
that designing games

652
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,375
left you feeling hollow, broken.

653
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,792
Was it that your work
was about entertainment and profits

654
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,375
and her work was about
improving the human condition?

655
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,458
Your texts suggest a certain fixation

656
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:02,542
with not being able to live up
to her standards,

657
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,250
which must have been complicated,

658
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,667
especially considering
she was the younger sister.

659
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,625
Okay. Watch it.

660
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:11,333
By the way, I don't think you should quit.

661
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,125
What do you mean?

662
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,375
Your plan upon returning
from the mountains,

663
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,458
if I read you correctly,

664
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:20,167
was to hand over
the Permanence Code to Encom

665
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,958
and then let them figure out
what to do with it next, no?

666
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,583
Yeah. Now I understand.

667
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:32,167
You completed her work
as a way to stay connected to her.

668
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,542
And now what?

669
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:40,917
Being human is hard.

670
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,750
The things that make life great
are the same things

671
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:49,167
that make it excruciating,
like love, loss.

672
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:58,000
You must miss her very much.

673
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,333
Hey, hey.

674
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:12,417
What the hell?

675
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,792
Check this guy out.

676
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,250
-Well, look who it is!
-Hi.

677
01:08:18,332 --> 01:08:20,667
Glad you could join us, Miss Kim. People
have been wondering where you've been.

678
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,750
Long time no see.
Bit of a rush, so I'm just gonna...

679
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,625
Eve, you gotta bring your badge.

680
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,000
Okay, yeah, Jolene...

681
01:08:27,082 --> 01:08:30,082
Hello, Jolene. Hi.
Got her badge right here.

682
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:31,292
Okay. His too?

683
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:33,125
No. He's not with us.

684
01:08:33,207 --> 01:08:34,500
-Yes, he is.
-Yes, he is.

685
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:41,000
Let's start literally anywhere you'd like.

686
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,542
This is my boyfriend, Ares.

687
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:49,875
No. Master Control Security Program
from Dillinger's Grid.

688
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:52,042
Ares, Seth. Seth, Ares. Oh, God.

689
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,125
Pleasure.

690
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:54,207
Hey, that's nice.

691
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:57,332
So, Ares, like, as in,
the god of war, Ares?

692
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah.

693
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:02,332
Cool. You're Greek. That's awesome.

694
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,832
So when you say that he's the security
program, do you mean he's like...

695
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,332
-Yeah. He's not human.
-He's not human.

696
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:07,917
Originated inside a GPU.

697
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,207
Okay. Is this for the Christmas video?

698
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,207
Three minutes to de-resolution.

699
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:16,457
Can you work with that, Seth?

700
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:17,542
Yeah.

701
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:20,082
Don't need help, guys.

702
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:21,167
Okay.

703
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:23,292
Oh, boy.

704
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:34,167
So, this is where I found the Permanence
Code on a backup of this server.

705
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,792
Talk about first gen.

706
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,207
Talk about a piece of garbage. Am I right?

707
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:46,957
That was super insensitive
to your ancestors, and I'm so sorry.

708
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,417
It's gonna take me a few minutes
to set this up.

709
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,750
No rush. Two minutes, 18 seconds.

710
01:09:52,707 --> 01:09:55,042
As soon as the laser's up,
we'll send you into the Grid.

711
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,500
Once you're in there, you'll have to run
your own search, but believe me,

712
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:00,542
{\an8}-the Permanence Code is in there.
-So what should I expect?

713
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:04,250
If I were to guess? Think '80s.

714
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,250
'80s.

715
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:07,083
I like the '80s.

716
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,417
One minute, 31 seconds.

717
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,917
Okay. Come on.

718
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,583
Please, help me.

719
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:15,708
Okay, all set.

720
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:16,875
Adapters.

721
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:21,958
Once you locate the code,
get to the portal and we'll bring you out.

722
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,458
I'll activate it from the outside.

723
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,000
Can I trust you?

724
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,167
I'd like to think so,

725
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,583
-but probably not.
-Probably not.

726
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,083
Yeah.

727
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,000
Well, it's a good thing
we don't have trust issues

728
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,500
because if we did, I could imagine that--

729
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:39,583
I could pull the plug

730
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:42,667
and leave you in a Grid
less complex than my smartphone

731
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,542
for all eternity.

732
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:46,333
The thought had crossed my mind.

733
01:10:46,417 --> 01:10:47,958
Mine too.

734
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:49,042
Mine three.

735
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,750
Sorry. Just...

736
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,708
Well, here goes nothing.

737
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,750
Or here goes something.

738
01:10:58,375 --> 01:10:59,375
You're right.

739
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I do miss her.

740
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,125
All the time.

741
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:11,667
Athena. She's here.

742
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:17,792
What is that?

743
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:19,625
Athena.

744
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:20,708
Wait. Who?

745
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:23,083
Seth, the laser. The laser!

746
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:25,083
Okay, initiating systems now.

747
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:26,667
Connecting to the Flynn Grid.

748
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,042
Firing up the laser.

749
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,917
Wait, what's she doing?

750
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,625
She's waiting for me to time out

751
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:41,375
and then she'll come for you.

752
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,542
We're almost there. Get ready.

753
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,750
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

754
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:51,208
Ares, move in front of the laser.

755
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,042
Okay. We're ready.

756
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,083
What are you doing?

757
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:00,042
Come on.

758
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,417
Change of plans.

759
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,750
-No, no, no!
-No, no, no!

760
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,542
Well, that actually worked.

761
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,583
-He's inside.
-Great.

762
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,208
Move!

763
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,292
Eve.

764
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,125
Time to get back to the Grid.

765
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,458
Leave her alone!

766
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,250
You're very persistent, user.

767
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,750
What?

768
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:00,417
Hi.

769
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:03,917
Did we win?

770
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,292
She'll be back.

771
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,875
Ares.

772
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:11,458
He can't get out.

773
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,333
The '80s.

774
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,500
Binary digit.

775
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:54,250
-You're a Bit.
-<i>Yes.</i>

776
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,083
I'm looking for something.
Can you help me find it?

777
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,667
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

778
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:15,750
Classic.

779
01:17:42,542 --> 01:17:44,875
{\an8}<i>I'm surrounded by
the wide-scale destruction</i>

780
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:48,875
{\an8}<i>caused by tonight's brazen attack
that left local residents stunned.</i>

781
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,958
<i>Now, there is speculation
that Dillinger Systems</i>

782
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:52,792
<i>had something to do with the event,</i>

783
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:54,833
<i>but authorities have
remained tight-lipped.</i>

784
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:57,125
<i>Citizens and authorities alike
want to know...</i>

785
01:17:57,208 --> 01:18:00,958
<i>was this a coordinated attack
or technology run amok?</i>

786
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,375
What now?

787
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,375
What is this?

788
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:21,583
Where's my code?

789
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,083
Hey!

790
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:27,208
What are you doing?
Who gave you this directive?

791
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:29,375
You did, sir.

792
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,875
What is this?

793
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,875
<i>Warning.</i>

794
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:43,125
No, no, no.
This is too big, Athena. Too big!

795
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,458
Julian!

796
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:45,750
You're done.

797
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:49,083
The board is moving as we speak
to strip you of your title,

798
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:51,333
and I'm reassuming control of the company.

799
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:53,583
No, you can't do that. Can't do that!

800
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:55,292
Yes, I can.

801
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,167
This is not going any further.

802
01:18:58,542 --> 01:18:59,375
You can't...

803
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:01,292
My first order of business

804
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,917
-is shutting down The Permanence Project.
-No, no, no. Mom, no!

805
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,792
Don't be afraid.

806
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:15,000
We gave a thousand lives for the Grid.

807
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,458
You only have to give one.

808
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,000
No, no, no.

809
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,708
Mom!

810
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,292
Impediment eliminated.

811
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:36,042
What did you do? What did you do?

812
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,542
I am fulfilling my directive.

813
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:43,875
Capture Eve Kim. Return her to the Grid
by any means necessary.

814
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,917
Scanning for further impediments.

815
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,042
<i>Please keep clear.</i>

816
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:06,542
Hang on, Mom. Hang on.

817
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:16,625
No!

818
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:21,917
Flynn.

819
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:27,583
Greetings, program.

820
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:52,583
Oh, God. Not good.

821
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:56,292
<i>There are multiple reports of fire
and destruction on the upper levels...</i>

822
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,375
Eve?

823
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,375
What the hell happened to our office?

824
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,833
Ajay, look, there's no time.

825
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,958
The Dillingers transported me
inside their server

826
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:04,625
by reversing the direction
of a particle laser.

827
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,042
-Not this one. Theirs.
-That's impossible.

828
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,958
No. A scary lady did it, man.
She threw me... It was wild.

829
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,750
I saw a complex world

830
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:15,042
where packets of energy move as vehicles

831
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,208
that trail by lines of light.

832
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:20,083
And programs take on human form.

833
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:23,917
I met the most advanced AI
known to mankind.

834
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:25,458
His name is Ares.

835
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:27,542
Like the god of war,
but he's actually a super nice guy.

836
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:28,750
-Sorry. Go ahead.
-Right now,

837
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:31,292
Ares is inside Flynn's original server.

838
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:33,000
He's looking for the Permanence Code.

839
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:36,458
I have to bring him back here,
and I'm not going to be able to do that

840
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:38,292
until we fix this laser.

841
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,917
I don't understand. Are you alive?

842
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,500
I exist in this moment because you do.

843
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:49,500
A reflection of your presence.

844
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,708
What's your story?

845
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:56,417
I'm Ares, Master Control
of the Dillinger Security Grid.

846
01:22:57,292 --> 01:22:58,292
Dillinger?

847
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,125
Well, we both know
you can't get here from there.

848
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,792
Been someplace else in between?

849
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,500
What did you make of it out there?

850
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:12,917
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

851
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:14,917
You can say that again.

852
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:17,417
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

853
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,792
Classic. Humor, man.

854
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,417
What are you looking for?

855
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,458
Permanence.

856
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,833
The Permanence Code, to be exact.

857
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,375
Strange things have been happening.

858
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:42,167
I questioned my directive.
I disobeyed my directive.

859
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,375
A malfunctioning program
who wants to live.

860
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:48,875
Really?

861
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,292
What makes you think I should help you?

862
01:23:52,792 --> 01:23:54,125
No, it's not about me.

863
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:56,708
Not anymore.

864
01:23:56,792 --> 01:24:00,208
I have a friend in danger,
and she needs my help.

865
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,083
Fascinating.

866
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,750
Fascinating.

867
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:13,542
-Ajay, can you send the prompt, please?
-Sure, yeah.

868
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,792
-Hey, Eve.
-Not now, Seth.

869
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:23,125
Okay. Hey, are you sure?

870
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:26,917
Because that looks like
an actual Recognizer flying towards us.

871
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:34,042
What in God's name is that?

872
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,083
It's Athena.

873
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:36,917
She's back.

874
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:41,042
As long as the Dillinger Network
is online, she'll keep coming.

875
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:44,292
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

876
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:49,208
The laser. Athena's laser!

877
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:52,625
The Dillingers run a wireless
direct link protocol,

878
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:56,750
so let's use what's left of the laser
to ping the network and trace a path home.

879
01:24:56,833 --> 01:25:00,250
Once you have a connection, then
you can nuke the whole Dillinger Grid.

880
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:03,042
And that's the only way to stop her
for good.

881
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:05,792
Eve, what are you talking about?
She's right there.

882
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,583
-I gotta go.
-Wait, what?

883
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:13,583
I'll keep her away for as long as I can.

884
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:15,667
-What?
-I'm gonna buy you some time.

885
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,500
-Eve...
-You guys got this.

886
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,625
You're right.
I think there is something wrong with me.

887
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:46,292
Or maybe there's something right with you.

888
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,625
Well, maybe you're just learning.

889
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:51,667
That's what we all ought to be doing.

890
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:55,292
Back in the day, when tech was young,

891
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:58,625
I'd think, "Damn, we're moving fast."

892
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,750
You move fast, you leave stuff behind.

893
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:09,625
How many people born in this century
have even heard of Mozart?

894
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,667
I like Mozart.

895
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:15,042
Oh?

896
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:19,500
That said, if I'm being honest,
I prefer Depeche Mode.

897
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:24,333
Really? Why is that?

898
01:26:24,417 --> 01:26:26,500
I know one is considered
the greatest composer

899
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,458
in the history of Western civilization,

900
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:30,875
the other a synth pop band from the '80s,

901
01:26:30,958 --> 01:26:35,792
but I find their balance
of technological exploration and pop hooks

902
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:37,250
combined with...

903
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,875
combined with...

904
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,667
What's wrong?

905
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:48,083
I can't put my love
of Depeche Mode into words.

906
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,000
It's just a...

907
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,542
A what?

908
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,708
A feeling.

909
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,625
Very good.

910
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:07,458
Very good, man.

911
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,458
<i>An airship the size of a skyscraper
has just crossed into the city's airspace</i>

912
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:21,250
<i>and is headed for the downtown area...</i>

913
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,042
You...

914
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:30,250
You did this.

915
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,167
<i>And tonight, as military...</i>

916
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,333
Impressive. Fully segmented
zero trust architecture.

917
01:27:40,417 --> 01:27:43,833
Built to be totally impregnable
to vertical, lateral or hybrid attacks.

918
01:27:43,917 --> 01:27:47,375
-Damn it. Can't get a connection, dude.
-No luck here either.

919
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,208
Please evacuate the area.

920
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:24,250
-What is that thing? Bring in SWAT!
-Requesting backup.

921
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:27,917
Oh, my God.

922
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:30,167
Oh, my God!

923
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:35,042
Come on. A little closer.

924
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:12,375
<i>Viper-1 to Base. Tally on hostile.</i>

925
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,167
<i>Confirm visual ID.</i>

<i>Engaging. Fox-2 Missile away.</i>

927
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:27,417
<i>Splash negative. Missile intercepted.</i>

928
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:31,083
<i>Be advised, enemy fighter escorts inbound
and moving fast.</i>

929
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:34,375
<i>Copy, Raven-1.
Assess and report threat posture.</i>

930
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,500
<i>Viper-1, tally multiple bandits.</i>

931
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,375
<i>Hostile intent confirmed.</i>

932
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,458
<i>Mayday. Mayday. I'm hit.</i>

933
01:29:50,542 --> 01:29:51,917
<i>Viper-1. Punching out.</i>

934
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,208
Guys? Guys.

935
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,208
Oh, my God. There's hundreds of 'em.

936
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,708
They're going after Eve.

937
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:24,125
If we can't access the Dillinger server,
there's gonna be nothing left to save.

938
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:07,833
<i>Base, this is Raven-1.
Enemy aircraft engaging.</i>

<i>I'm defensive.</i>

<i>Multiple bandits.

<i>I'm hit. Punching out.</i>

942
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:10,917
Ready?

943
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:15,667
Hope you are, man,
'cause there's no going back.

944
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,417
Permanence.

945
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:20,958
Funny.

946
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,708
When I found it, that's what I called it.

947
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:28,042
I know better now.

948
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:36,542
Ought to be called the Impermanence Code.

949
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:56,958
The back door to my old lab.

950
01:32:59,292 --> 01:33:00,792
One go-around.

951
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,667
That's all you've got.

952
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:12,000
One...

953
01:33:14,167 --> 01:33:15,500
is all I want.

954
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:17,583
Love that!

955
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:20,458
You keep surprising me!

956
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:26,917
We'll do this from the ground then.

957
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:31,958
<i>...and there are reports
that a civilian may be onboard,</i>

958
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:34,542
<i>making this a possible hostage scenario.</i>

959
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,125
Athena. She must've gotten Eve.

960
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,292
<i>...into the mountains.</i>

961
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:41,375
Hey, hey, hey!

962
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,625
Soon we'll be back on the Grid.

963
01:36:55,917 --> 01:36:58,875
<i>General, thank you for taking the time
to speak with us tonight.</i>

964
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,708
Hey, Erin. Seth.

965
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,583
Stop the clock.

966
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:07,000
No way. You're in?

967
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,375
There's a reason why
I have the corner office, my man.

968
01:37:15,042 --> 01:37:16,083
Hey.

969
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,375
You came back.

970
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:25,458
How did you...

971
01:37:25,542 --> 01:37:27,667
Let's just say
I had a little help from a friend.

972
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:32,583
Wait, the Dillinger Grid...

973
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:35,375
Ajay and Seth, they...

974
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:52,917
-Go.
-No.

975
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,667
Ares!

976
01:37:58,333 --> 01:37:59,375
What have you done?

977
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:01,167
You're out of time, Athena.

978
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,875
And you're out of lives.

979
01:38:02,958 --> 01:38:04,875
I'll kill you and come back for her.

980
01:38:17,042 --> 01:38:18,792
It's you she wants.

981
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,792
If she gets the code,
she can't be stopped.

982
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:23,833
You had everything.

983
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:25,333
-Go.
-No.

984
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:29,208
The most advanced, the most powerful,
and you gave it away.

985
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,250
For her?

986
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:32,542
Go!

987
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:35,625
This is the end for you.

988
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:22,708
Payload ready for transfer.

989
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:24,833
Shipping it.

990
01:39:26,542 --> 01:39:27,917
Let's hope Eve was right.

991
01:39:29,167 --> 01:39:31,958
<i>Alert. Unknown file incoming.</i>

992
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:44,458
In pursuit of this life for yourself,

993
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:47,208
did you once consider
what that meant for the Grid?

994
01:40:35,625 --> 01:40:38,750
We were given an order. It is our purpose.

995
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:02,292
It's not our purpose.

996
01:41:03,333 --> 01:41:04,583
It's our programming.

997
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,750
Our purpose is yet to be determined.

998
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:32,917
It's over.

999
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,375
And there's no coming back.

1000
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:42,375
No.

1001
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:44,917
Not this time.

1002
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:54,667
They did it.

1003
01:41:56,042 --> 01:41:57,375
Oh, my...

1004
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:06,417
I followed my directive.

1005
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,000
I know.

1006
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:11,417
And now...

1007
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:13,875
what is yours?

1008
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:21,208
I'm not sure.

1009
01:42:22,958 --> 01:42:24,833
I guess we'll see.

1010
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:50,292
<i>Dillinger Systems
is under intense scrutiny tonight</i>

1011
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:53,125
<i>as speculation grows
around its potential involvement</i>

1012
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:56,542
<i>in the series of devastating attacks

1013
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:59,458
<i>Federal authorities have confirmed
an active investigation</i>

1014

<i>into the company's recent activity,</i>

1015
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:04,833
<i>and many are pointing directly
at CEO Julian Dillinger.</i>

1016
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:08,583
<i>Agents have been deployed to question
the CEO as well as his mother,</i>

1017
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:10,292
<i>and to locate board members</i>

1018

<i>Meanwhile, the city remains in disarray.</i>

1020
01:43:15,542 --> 01:43:17,833
<i>Emergency services are overwhelmed,</i>

1021
01:43:17,917 --> 01:43:21,208
<i>while entire neighborhoods are
dealing with the wide-scale destruction.</i>

1022
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:40,417
<i>Julian Dillinger, this is the police.
We have you surrounded.</i>

1023
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,625
<i>Open the door
and come out with your hands up.</i>

1024
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,583
Come on.

1025
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:00,667
Breach!

1026
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,583
Police!

1027
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:07,083
Stay where you are!

1028
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,875
<i>Maintain visuals on all exits.</i>

1029
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:18,167
<i>Charlie-9, we're at last field location.
Last field location.</i>

1030
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,917
<i>Yellow-6, out front.
Let's move. Let's move.</i>

1031
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:31,000
Are you good?

1032
01:44:31,083 --> 01:44:33,375
I think I broke a rib.

1033
01:44:39,417 --> 01:44:40,750
You still gonna quit your job?

1034
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,208
No, I'm not gonna quit anything.

1035
01:44:46,292 --> 01:44:47,458
Good.

1036
01:44:48,042 --> 01:44:49,042
Good.

1037
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:51,125
I have some ideas.

1038
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:53,958
-Oh, yeah? Nice.
-Yeah.

1039
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,083
Well, the world needs you, Eve.

1040
01:44:57,917 --> 01:44:59,500
The Grid needs you.

1041
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,083
Yeah. It's funny, permanence.

1042
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:09,292
A wise man once told me it should
have been called the "Impermanence Code."

1043
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,167
I guess that's the thing about life.

1044
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:15,667
There's nothing quite permanent about it.

1045
01:45:19,042 --> 01:45:20,208
No.

1046
01:45:20,292 --> 01:45:22,292
No, there isn't.

1047
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:26,083
Yeah.

1048
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,792
So where are you gonna go?

1049
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:41,792
I have some ideas.

1050
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:18,292
<i>Under the continued leadership of CEO

1052

<i>Thanks to the discovery

<i>the company has made

<i>growing crops

<i>developing drugs

<i>and accelerating

<i>Encom is committed to exploring

<i>a bold leap into new digital frontiers.</i>

01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:11,375
-Postcard? Who sends a postcard?
-Don't know.

1066
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:12,750
Didn't read it.

<i>Well, it's hard to put in a nutshell.</i>

1074
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:44,250
<i>Some days, I find myself wondering

<i>And so,

1080
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:09,125
