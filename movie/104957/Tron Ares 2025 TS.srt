1
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,420
The Grid.

2
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:30,596
A digital frontier.

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,120
A world beyond the screen
as real as our own.

4
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:37,456
I can picture it.

5
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,740
Clusters of information rising like cities.

6
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,440
Programs as complex as you and me.

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,480
In just a few years we're gonna
be able to enter this world.

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,100
And a few years after that, well,
this world will come into ours.

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,700
Intelligent life from inside the machine.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,220
I, for one, can't wait to meet him.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,720
<i>Our lead story; ENCOM CEO and video
game icon Kevin Flynn has disappeared.</i>

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,300
<i>He was best known for designing
Tron and Space Paranoids,</i>

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,680
<i>the best selling video games in history.</i>

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,560
<i>The company that started at
Kevin Flynn's arcade in the 1980's</i>

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,180
<i>has faced years of corporate turmoil.</i>

16
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,404
<i>Can it find its way to the victory screen once again?</i>

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,720
<i>It's a sister act for ENCOM.</i>

18
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:27,144
<i>Eve and Tess Kim take the reins
of the massive tech company</i>

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,910
<i>after Sam Flynn resigned
for personal reasons.</i>

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,660
<i>ENCOM's rebound under the Kim sisters leadership</i>

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>has competitors rushing to respond.</i>

22
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:38,096
<i>Software giant Dillinger Systems
appoints its new CEO,</i>

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,800
<i>Julian Dillinger, who vows to
restore his grandfather's legacy.</i>

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,600
<i>The race between ENCOM and Dillinger
Systems heats up as new CEOs</i>

25
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,184
<i>Julian Dillinger and the Kim sisters square off.</i>

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,260
<i>Here at ENCOM, we believe the beauty of AI</i>

27
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:56,115
<i>is not the ability to build smarter
weapons but to uplift humanity.</i>

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,530
<i>Feed the hungry, cure the sick, educate the world.</i>

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,200
<i>Rival CEO's Julian Dillinger and Eve Kim
have gone quiet in recent months,</i>

30
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:09,345
<i>raising speculation the two companies are very close
to a substantial technological breakthrough.</i>

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,300
<i>One that has the potential to transform humanity
in ways we have never seen before.</i>

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,350
<i>The future may well lie in the
hands of whoever gets there first.</i>

33
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,485
<b>Welcome.</b>

34
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,890
Who are you?

35
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,150
<b>I am your creator.</b>

36
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,150
And who am I?

37
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,074
<b>Not who. what.</b>

38
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,510
<b>You are Dillinger Systems security software.</b>

39
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,050
<b>Program name, Ares.</b>

40
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,926
<b>Defender of the Grid.</b>

41
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,030
<b>You are Master Control.</b>

42
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,510
Ares.
I am Master Control.

43
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,200
So, you made it.

44
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,576
I had a feeling that you would.

45
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,160
I always dreamed that we would do this together.

46
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,670
I'll admit, not exactly like this.

47
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,910
But I'm glad you're here.

48
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,930
I'm really glad. And Evie, remember.

49
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,890
I'm still here, even if you can't see me.

50
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:33,414
I love you.

51
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,250
Oh, my god. Oh, Eve.

52
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,490
I'm not sure you actually told me we'd be
stealing energy from the power grid.

53
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,110
Wow.

54
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,134
So this is where she kept coming back to, huh?

55
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,700
To be this disconnected from the world...

56
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,265
That is dedication, my friend.

57
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:51,696
Wow.
It looks like your sister had a little crush.

58
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,560
Yeah. She was so sure Flynn left us the answer.

59
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,440
Like, on a floppy disk?
Poor Flynn lived before the cloud, huh?

60
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,060
Hey, are you still gonna be doing
CEO type stuff while we're out here?

61
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,780
You know, like earnings calls and
the launch of Panic City and stuff?

62
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,265
Let's just get this done.

63
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,790
Dude, I can make breakfast burritos right here.

64
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:12,254
Hell, yeah.

65
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,250
This is for you, Tess.

66
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,470
Members of the board.

67
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:40,210
For over 40 years, my family at Dillinger Systems
has battled ENCOM for control of the future.

68
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,530
You put me in charge of the
company to ensure our victory.

69
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,790
Today, I make it so.

70
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,110
Imagine if all our digital prowess wasn't just digital.

71
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,410
What if anything we could dream in the
machine could become a reality here?

72
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,550
What if we could build the bridge
between two previously walled-off worlds?

73
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,290
So much talk of AI and big tech today.

74
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,410
Virtual worlds, what are they gonna look like?
When will we get there?

75
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,390
Well, folks, we're not going there.

76
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,430
They are coming here.

77
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,490
[ATTENTION]

78
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,430
[PLEASE PUT ON YOUR SAFETY GLASSES NOW]

79
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,240
Laser systems activated.
Power fluctuations are nominal.

80
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,220
[WARNING]
[STAND CLEAR]

81
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,100
Outputting from Dillinger Systems server.

82
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,360
Raw material inflow initiated.

83
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:03,084
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7 -

84
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:09,008
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

85
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,632
Transfer complete.

86
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,360
I present the Dillinger Systems
amphibious rapid response tank.

87
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,520
The D.A.R.T.

88
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,380
Digitally modeled inside our server
outproducing our patented laser technology.

89
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:27,704
With an M-1 rifle gun. Two M-240 machine guns.

90
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,780
It's got a top speed of 75 miles per hour.

91
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,680
Durability? You find a wall,
this thing is gonna drive through it.

92
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,150
This is full scale war. Five minutes notice.

93
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,470
So, if we can create the hardware of the future,

94
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,735
then why not the soldier to operate it?

95
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,330
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like you to meet Ares.

96
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,210
This is the most sophisticated
security program ever written.

97
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,410
You want to shake his hand?
Go ahead. He doesn't bite.

98
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,630
Ares has billions of lines of code unique to him.

99
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:26,454
Is it alive?

100
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,110
That depends on your definition, Stewart.

101
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,530
Because unlike you, he's biblically strong,
lightning fast and supremely intelligent.

102
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:43,744
He is fully proprietary and 100% expendable.

103
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,690
Ares is the ultimate soldier.
He needs no food, no water, sheds no blood.

104
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,490
And if, by some miracle, he is
struck down on the battlefield,

105
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,490
I will simply make you another.

106
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,620
With all that sophisticated code,
what makes you think you can contain it?

107
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:15,805
I can assure you, General, the most advanced failsafe
mechanisms and restriction protocols are in place.

108
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,120
Ares is predictable, controllable and fully alive.

109
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,810
Southerly front with isentropic left turning cyclonic.
Predicted precipitation, 2.6 inches.

110
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,070
I hope that you brought your umbrellas.

111
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,570
I have to hand it to you, Julian.
You promised a big win.

112
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,695
And this is even bigger than
any of us could've imagined.

113
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,486
Thank you.

114
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,950
My grandfather started Dillinger Corporation long
before anybody heard the term "cyber security".

115
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,440
Military AI is the future.

116
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,180
The question is not whether the car should be built.

117
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,540
The car is being built right now.

118
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,200
The question is, who's holding the keys?

119
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,240
That was quite some parlor trick.

120
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:42,736
Time?

121
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,436
44 seconds.

122
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
"I hope you brought your umbrellas?"

123
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,360
Oh, was that in the script or
was he just having a moment?

124
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,200
Elizabeth Dillinger, eldest daughter
of founder, Edward Dillinger, deceased.

125
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,720
Longtime CEO during a relatively unremarkable period

126
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,940
of corporate history before being
superseded by your only son.

127
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,850
It's a pleasure.

128
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,886
"Unremarkable?"

129
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,870
Market share was up 12% during my tenure.
That's hardly...

130
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,870
Anyway, we don't say superseded. We...

131
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,390
We call it giving birth.

132
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:21,214
Of course.

133
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,550
It's an honor to meet my creator's creator.

134
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:28,045
Oh, here we go.

135
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,600
I noticed you left out the part
where you can't seem to keep

136
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,401
this thing of yours alive for more than 25 minutes.

137
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,997
Twenty-nine.

138
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:48,241
Deceiving your investors, Julian,
is hardly a business model.

139
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,060
Whoever controls the Permanence Code controls the future.

140
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,668
We have to win.

141
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:02,431
Look, I...

142
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,155
admire your vision.

143
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:07,779
Straighten up.

144
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:11,491
However, the board will only stand behind you

145
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:16,015
for another six months if you're lucky.

146
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:18,751
But if it doesn't work,

147
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:24,011
all of this goes away, darling.

148
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,851
Everything we have built

149
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:31,111
for the past 40 years.

150
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:36,271
What if I said I'd found a way?

151
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,701
I think this is my 95th breakfast burrito and,

152
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:11,621
honestly, can't get enough.
Isn't that wild?

153
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,450
Well,

154
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,450
Nice to see Tess wasn't the
only obsessive one in the family.

155
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,010
Yeah, Seth, you're right. Sorry. Should've paid
more attention to you. Oh, don't worry about it.

156
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,250
Okay...

157
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,721
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here.

158
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:48,634
Look, three months in sub zero
is a long time, I get it.

159
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:54,521
Yeah, four days, 10 hours, 32 minutes.
Who's counting, really? You know...

160
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,141
Hold on.

161
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:01,265
What do you mean?

162
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:03,189
What?

163
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,181
Seth?

164
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:27,671
- What, you found something?
- I think so.

165
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:30,461
The line of code.

166
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,485
That's how he hid it.
It's two lines.

167
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,881
Wow...

168
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:40,705
That looks like a double helix.

169
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:42,901
It is a double helix.

170
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,461
Tess would have loved this.

171
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,585
Wait, are you serious?
So, no more 29 minutes now?

172
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,041
If this is what I think it is,
it's the Permanence Code.

173
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:05,131
ENCOM, offline child 317 A-1.

174
00:19:05,155 --> 00:19:06,455
Permanence Code implemented.

175
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:10,071
Testing for asset stability
beyond current 29 minute barrier.

176
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,195
Go.

177
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,361
Ready when you are.

178
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:27,685
Okay.

179
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,661
It's all in the wrist, baby.

180
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:10,585
God, that never gets old.

181
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:11,566
Trial online.

182
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:13,811
29 minutes and counting down.

183
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:31,821
Let's see if you last this time.

184
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:37,621
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

185
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,711
If, by some miracle, he's
struck down on the battlefield,

186
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,935
I will simply make you another.

187
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:50,651
Fully proprietary, 100% Expendable.

188
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,031
Athena.

189
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:58,555
Welcome back, sir.
All units are online and ready for inspection.

190
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,551
So, how was was it?

191
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,875
It was interesting. Different this time.

192
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:07,151
I met a mother and a son.

193
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,675
It was raining.

194
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:13,081
The condensed moisture of the
atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops.

195
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,981
I could almost feel it.

196
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:17,901
Feel?

197
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,925
I don't understand.

198
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,221
This is Eve. Get sensible and text.

199
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:35,741
Hey, Eve, it's Aaron.
Got AJ for you again.

200
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:39,578
Hit us back.
Still straight to voicemail.

201
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,701
CEO of a Fortune 500 company and
your phone's down on our biggest night?

202
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,821
Goddam it.
Where the hell are you, Eve?

203
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:59,246
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

204
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:16,411
Did we just do it?
Dude, it's still there!

205
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:18,391
Did we just change the world, man?!

206
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:24,051
<i>Big news out of ENCOM tonight.</i>

207
00:22:24,088 --> 00:22:28,878
<i>CEO Eve Kim will not attend the
highly anticipated launch event</i>

208
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:32,581
<i>for the company's new game,
Space Paranoids: Panic City.</i>

209
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:38,341
<i>Kim, the visionary designer behind the
re-launch of the Blockbuster franchise...</i>

210
00:22:38,378 --> 00:22:43,298
Well, I spoke to several of our board members
and, needless to say, they are impressed.

211
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,041
Julian?

212
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,041
What are you doing?

213
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:51,682
Oh, just trying to change the world, Mother.

214
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,437
What's going on?

215
00:22:54,661 --> 00:22:56,791
You're hacking ENCOM?

216
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:59,115
Just a peek over the garden wall.
No one will notice.

217
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,351
What makes you think that ENCOM
is any closer to finding it?

218
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:04,309
Because I know who else
is looking for it, all right?

219
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,627
Who?

220
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:08,431
Eve Kim.

221
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,455
She's following in her sister's footsteps.

222
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:13,631
She's after the Permanence Code.
I can feel it. So I'm gonna find her.

223
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:14,757
- And when I get...
- No...

224
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,381
No. I don't like it. It's too risky, Julian.

225
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:25,961
Oops.

226
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,201
Security breach in all zones.

227
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,621
Our directive is clear.

228
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:07,597
Penetrate the server core and
extract Eve Kim's user file.

229
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:12,583
That is 5, 4, 3...

230
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,697
Space Pirates, rant!

231
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,981
Are you ready?

232
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,621
Put your hands together for ENCOM CTO,

233
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,481
- Ajay Singh!
- It's cowboy time.

234
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:25,405
- Get loud!
- Oh, no...

235
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,829
Whoo! Nice to see you!

236
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:34,041
Hello! Thank you!

237
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:37,381
What's up, Paranoia-Con?

238
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:02,481
I'm going in.

239
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:26,541
I'm in. I'm a genius.

240
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:28,098
Who knew you raised a genius, Mother?

241
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,322
I'm in!

242
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:31,546
In deep shit.

243
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,061
Initiate containment protocols
before all-network access.

244
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,785
We need a response now.

245
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,931
Initiate security protocol.

246
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:54,511
<i>...trusting artificial intelligence with their lives.</i>

247
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,614
<i>Are you comfortable with this?</i>

248
00:26:56,638 --> 00:27:00,238
<i>Well, look, for every doomsday scenario,</i>

249
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:03,771
<i>there is a medical breakthrough,
scientific discovery.</i>

250
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:08,154
<i>So maybe what emerges
from the unknown isn't so scary.</i>

251
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:12,811
<i>What if its major malfunction
is just benevolence?</i>

252
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:16,261
What is this? What's he doing?

253
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:20,361
<i>But still, would you prefer to talk to a real person?</i>

254
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:25,441
<i>Of course, but what if that person
is no longer in your life?</i>

255
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:28,065
<i>No longer here.</i>

256
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,501
I've got the file.

257
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:43,781
Congratulations...
Now, get out of there while you still can.

258
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:55,881
Programs. We fight.

259
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:21,901
Yes! Thank you so much!
what do Paranoiacs do?

260
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,425
Kias!

261
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,049
He's dysfuctional. Leave him!

262
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:00,091
You're gonna make it, Kias.

263
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:04,935
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
your knight to expose their queen.

264
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:36,551
To debut the latest version of
Space Paranoids: Panic City with the world.

265
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,526
- What is this?
- This is crazy.

266
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,750
- Vid screens down.
- Okay...

267
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:44,051
This is, uh, a technical difficulty.
We'll be back.

268
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:49,771
<b>Well done, Master Control.</b>

269
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:52,851
<b>Eve Kim's file aquired.</b>

270
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,617
<b>Objective achieved.</b>

271
00:29:56,241 --> 00:30:02,281
Sir, I'm curious why the program
Kias was not reconstituted.

272
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:07,801
<b>I'm curious why you are curious.</b>

273
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:11,460
<b>Kias was dysfunctional so he was deleted.</b>

274
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:17,321
Just like any program...

275
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:20,642
<b>that operates outside their directive can be.</b>

276
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:22,966
<b>Do you understand?</b>

277
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:31,501
<b>Acknowledge, Master Control.</b>

278
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,001
Of course.

279
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:37,225
We are 100% expendable.

280
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:40,081
<b>New mission, Master Control.</b>

281
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,105
<b>Locate Eve Kim.</b>

282
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:44,321
Yes, sir.

283
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,745
Seems like we had a little cyber breach, Jules.

284
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:48,561
But then, of course, you knew that.

285
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,185
And it looks like the whole world knows, buddy.

286
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,021
I want to stay off the Socials for a few days.

287
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,837
You want to play games with me?
Let's play games. Julian.

288
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,261
You know, I heard about your
cute little pitch to the board.

289
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,268
But you left off one key detail from your deck.

290
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:02,321
Did you tell him the shot clock expires at 29 minutes?

291
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,841
Don't make me call the Journal and tell
'em you're making promises you can't keep.

292
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:09,952
Promises? What, you mean like the one that your
CEO would be in-office running the company?

293
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:11,881
Something in the water over there, A.J?

294
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:14,626
I mean, first wonder boy, Sam Flynn, now his successor.

295
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:17,021
Where is she, AJ?
Do you even know where she is?

296
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:19,445
Maybe you're right.
Maybe Eve went nuts.

297
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:22,421
Maybe she went AWOL and left the country.

298
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,366
Or maybe she's holed up off the grid
looking for the same thing you are.

299
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:28,894
And I know who my money's on.

300
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:32,318
You mean what's left of it after tonight.
End of line!

301
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,651
I hate that man.

302
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,791
Thank you so much.

303
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,215
You know I made those oranges.
It's a long story.

304
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,491
What are you doing?

305
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:53,315
1913 messages. Popular.

306
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:56,311
Oh, it's A.J. Yeah, that's you.

307
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,801
A.J. Are you there?

308
00:31:58,841 --> 00:31:59,721
Am I here?

309
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:03,145
A brute force attack took down our servers
during our product launch in years.

310
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,221
Everything we built is melting down.
You need to get back here right now.

311
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:10,941
I found it, A.J. It's real.
Right where Tess thought it would be.

312
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,529
Flynn had it all along.

313
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:14,253
Are you talking about the Permanence Code?

314
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:18,461
Yeah. Four hours and counting.
Zero degradation, no instability.

315
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,461
It's incredible.

316
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:21,685
Wait a second.
Did you say four hours?

317
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:23,471
Yeah, four hours.

318
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:28,695
My God. He must know, Evie.
I just spoke to Dillinger.

319
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:31,311
Wait, you just spoke to Dillinger?

320
00:32:31,335 --> 00:32:33,235
He's looking for the code
and he thinks you are, too.

321
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:36,531
They're gonna move on us.
Eve, you got a great thing.

322
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,998
Tess did a great thing.
I'm on route to ENCOM.

323
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,431
We'll secure the code.
I have it with me on a drive.

324
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:53,041
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

325
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,801
<i>Mom...</i>

00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,645
<i>You got the news for we bring you home?</i>

328
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,069
<i>I'm trying.</i>

329
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:07,201
I am fearless, and therefore, powerful.

330
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:11,432

00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:22,375
<i>Crushed it.</i>

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,999
<i>Yes. Say I love you.</i>

336
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:29,023
<i>I love you.</i>

337
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:33,921
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

338
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,845
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

339
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:41,621
<i>Happy birthday, dear Tess.</i>

340
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:45,501

01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:45,661
These are the last 29 minutes you'll ever have.
Better make it count!

525
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:54,885
Oh-kay!

526
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:14,185
Too much of an ingress lag.

527
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:32,851
[TRANSFER COMPLETE]

528
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:39,711
Your directive is to find Eve Kim,
return her to the Grid and get me the Permanence Code.

529
01:02:39,729 --> 01:02:41,269
By any means necessary.

530
01:02:41,351 --> 01:02:46,701
Do you understand your directive, Master Control?

531
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:55,301
At your command, sir.

532
01:02:55,325 --> 01:02:57,325
At-a girl.

533
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:18,349
Tic-toc!

534
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:32,571
Now that is the coolest thing I have ever seen.

535
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:48,201
Do you know who Kevin Flynn was?

536
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,425
Of course. Visionary programmer.

537
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:53,961
Pioneered the Digital Frontier.
Disappeared 1989.

538
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:59,552
I found the permanence code on a backup of Flynn's server.
That server is at ENCOM's office downtown.

539
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:02,811
- So we can make it within...
- 26 minutes 9 seconds.

540
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:06,611
Eve, your plan contains two major flaws.

541
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:07,635
Okay.

542
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:09,791
One, ENCOM is 9.2 miles away.

543
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:13,576
Given our present speed and
sub-optimal choice of vehicle.

544
01:04:13,611 --> 01:04:16,111
- Oh, my god.
- Two, we're going to need a particle laser.

545
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,110
We need a phone.

546
01:04:34,521 --> 01:04:36,181
Not believing it is.

547
01:04:37,781 --> 01:04:40,681
Excuse me. Do you see this? This is me.

548
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:44,562
If you let me use your cell phone,
my assistant will wire you $10,000.

549
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,581
I just need your phone.

550
01:04:53,631 --> 01:04:55,411
Seth, where are you?

551
01:04:55,435 --> 01:04:57,135
Eve, whose phone is this?

552
01:04:57,211 --> 01:05:00,591
Listen to me.
I need you at ENCOM in 15 minutes.

553
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,590
Hey, is everything okay?

554
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:05,814
- Seth, bring the particle laser.
- ENCOM, 15 minutes. Got it.

555
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:10,071
- That's my car.
- I'll wire you another 50 K.

556
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:11,354
Hey, that's my car!

557
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:17,201
The Honda Civic. 2.0 4 cylinder
with 138 horsepower. Classic.

558
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:19,225
Hey! That's my car!

559
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,249
Get - That's my car...

560
01:05:46,231 --> 01:05:47,851
- Eve?
- Yeah.

561
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:53,027
I was thinking about the time you told your sister that
you wished you never relaunched Space Paranoids.

562
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,171
- Then you went on to say that you...
- Oh my god,

563
01:05:55,194 --> 01:05:56,934
Of course.
You read all my texts.

564
01:05:57,011 --> 01:06:00,611
- Yeah. Re, I read them all. Every single one.
- Wow.

565
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:05,268
Most of it was information of a personal nature.
Some of it highly personal.

566
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:08,181
And I just can't get enough.

567
01:06:08,505 --> 01:06:09,705
What?

568
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:14,321
Depeche Mode. Number eight
on the UK Singles Chart, 1982.

569
01:06:14,648 --> 01:06:21,008
I find their brand of pippy, catchy, timeless and
true 80's electro pop to be deeply invigorating.

570
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:32,471
16 minutes, 20 seconds.

571
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:37,094
Okay, so you like 80's pop
and cyber spying on me.

572
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:40,761
I was directed to kill you, Eve.
Hacking seems pretty tame by comparison.

573
01:06:44,746 --> 01:06:45,846
My god...

574
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:48,491
For the record, I don't think you
have anything to be ashamed of.

575
01:06:48,911 --> 01:06:51,591
Space Paranoids has entertained hundreds of millions.

576
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:53,664
Plus, it's a pretty cool game.

577
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:57,827
Anyway, you told your sister that designing
games left you feeling hollow, broken...

578
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:02,701
Was it that your work was about entertainment and profits
and her work was about improving the human condition?

579
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:07,008
Your texts suggest a certain fixation with
not being able to live up to her standards.

580
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:11,161
Which must have been complicated,
especially considering she was a younger sister.

581
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:13,381
Okay, watch it.

582
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,521
By the way, I don't think you should quit.

583
01:07:18,154 --> 01:07:19,524
What do you mean?

584
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:22,397
Your plan, upon returning from the mountains,
if I read you correctly,

585
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:27,221
was to hand over the Permanence Code to ENCOM
and then let them figure out what to do with it next. No?

586
01:07:30,661 --> 01:07:32,781
Yeah. Now I understand.

587
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:36,701
You completed her work as a
way to stay connected to her.

588
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:41,201
Huh. And now what?

589
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:45,641
Being human is hard.

590
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:49,664
The things that make life great are the
same things that make it excruciating.

591
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:53,791
Like love, loss.

592
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:02,371
You must miss her very much.

593
01:08:14,905 --> 01:08:16,405
What the hell?

594
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,430
Oh, check this guy out.

595
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,000
Oh, there it is.
Glad you could join us, Ms. Kim.

596
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:24,073
People have been wondering where you've been.

597
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,197
Long time no see.
Bit of a rush, so I'm just gonna...

598
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:30,480
- Eve? You gotta bring your badge.
- Okay. Yeah. Jolene...

599
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,730
Hello, hello, Jolene. Hi.
Have her badge right here.

600
01:08:33,754 --> 01:08:34,854
His, too?

601
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,911
- Nope, he's not with us.
- Yes, he is. - He is.

602
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,471
We can start literally anywhere you'd like.

603
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:48,291
This is my boyfriend, Ares.

604
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:53,291
No. Master Control security
program from Dillinger's grid.

605
01:08:53,316 --> 01:08:55,336
Ares. Seth. Seth, Ares. My god...

606
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,960
- Pleasure.
- Hey, that's nice.

607
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:59,991
So Ares, like, as in the god of war "Aries"?

608
01:09:00,021 --> 01:09:03,541
- Yeah.
- Cool.

609
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:05,565
You're Greek. That's awesome.

610
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:07,401
So, when you say that he's a security program,

611
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:09,125
- do you mean he's not...
- Yeah. He's not human.

612
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:10,901
- Not human.
- Was made inside a GPU.

613
01:09:12,761 --> 01:09:14,761
Okay, is this for the Christmas video?

614
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:18,341
Three minutes to de-resolution.

615
01:09:18,365 --> 01:09:20,365
- Can you work with that, Seth?
- Yeah.

616
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:23,341
Don't need help, guys.

617
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:24,765
Okay.

618
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:27,001
Oh, my...

619
01:09:27,025 --> 01:09:29,825
(Kevin Flynn's Office)

620
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:36,830
So this is where I found the Permanence
Code on a backup of this server.

621
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,510
Talk about first gen.

622
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:46,934
Talk about visa garbage. Am I right?

623
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:50,070
That was super insensitive to
your ancestors and I'm so sorry.

624
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,170
It's going to take me a few minutes to set this up.

625
01:09:52,194 --> 01:09:54,594
No rush. 2 minutes, 18 seconds.

626
01:09:54,911 --> 01:09:57,611
As soon as the laser's up, we'll send you into the grid.

627
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,327
Once you're in there, you'll have to
run your own search, but believe me,

628
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:01,791
the Permanence Code is in there.

629
01:10:01,815 --> 01:10:03,815
So what should I expect?

630
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:06,951
If I were to guess, think 80's.

631
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,860
80's. I like the 80's.
1 minute, 31 seconds.

632
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,651
Okay, go.

633
01:10:14,675 --> 01:10:16,275
Please, help me.

634
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:18,161
Okay. All set.

635
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:20,185
That's yours.

636
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:25,171
Once you locate the code,
get to the portal and we'll bring you out.

637
01:10:25,311 --> 01:10:27,591
I'll activate it from the outside.

638
01:10:27,615 --> 01:10:29,615
Can I trust you?

639
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:35,711
I'd like to think so but probably not.

640
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,691
Well, it's a good thing we don't have trust issues.
Because if we did,

641
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:41,491
- I could imagine...
- I could pull the plug

642
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:46,674
and leave you on a grid less complex
than my smartphone phone for all eternity.

643
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:48,821
The thought had crossed my mind.

644
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,845
- Mine too.
- Oh, mine, three.

645
01:10:54,901 --> 01:10:57,321
Well, here goes nothing.

646
01:10:57,345 --> 01:10:59,345
Or here goes something.

647
01:11:00,241 --> 01:11:04,381
You're right. I do miss her.

648
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,161
All the time.

649
01:11:11,011 --> 01:11:14,251
Athena. She's here.

650
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:19,491
Oh. What is that?

651
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:21,515
Athena.

652
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:22,739
Wait. Who?

653
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:25,311
Seth, the laser. The laser!

654
01:11:25,435 --> 01:11:27,235
Okay. Initiating systems now.

655
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:29,171
Connecting to the Flynn grid.

656
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:35,641
Firing up the laser.

657
01:11:37,341 --> 01:11:38,481
What's she doing?

658
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:40,705
She's waiting for me to time out.

659
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:43,301
Then she'll come for you.

660
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:49,421
We're almost there. Get ready.

661
01:11:49,445 --> 01:11:50,845
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

662
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:52,821
Ares, move in front of the laser.

663
01:11:54,981 --> 01:11:56,241
Okay, were ready.

664
01:11:57,665 --> 01:11:59,365
What are you doing?

665
01:12:00,461 --> 01:12:01,461
Come on.

666
01:12:06,231 --> 01:12:08,231
Change of plans.

667
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,561
Wow, that actually worked.

668
01:13:01,391 --> 01:13:02,791
He's inside.

669
01:13:02,815 --> 01:13:04,815
The grid.

670
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:12,439
Move!

671
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:50,463
Eve...

672
01:14:10,911 --> 01:14:12,271
Time to get back to the grid.

673
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:13,794
Leave her alone!

674
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:54,741
You're very persistent, user.

675
01:15:54,571 --> 01:15:56,071
Hey.

676
01:15:57,861 --> 01:15:58,861
Ah...

677
01:15:58,885 --> 01:16:00,885
Wait...

678
01:16:05,011 --> 01:16:06,811
Oh, did we win?

679
01:16:07,135 --> 01:16:08,535
She'll be back.

680
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:14,811
Ares. He can't get out.

681
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:42,021
The 80's.

682
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:56,751
Binary digit. You're a bit.

683
01:16:58,991 --> 01:17:02,111
I'm looking for something.
Can you help me find it?

684
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:20,311
Classic.

685
01:17:45,931 --> 01:17:50,231
<i>I'm surrounded by the wide scale
destruction caused by tonight's races.</i>

686
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,730
<i>An attack left local residents stunned.</i>

687
01:17:52,754 --> 01:17:56,154
<i>Now, there is speculation that Dillinger
Systems had something to do with the event.</i>

688
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:58,961
<i>Authorities have relayed...</i>

689
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:05,985
What now?

690
01:18:22,061 --> 01:18:23,841
What is this?

691
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:26,265
Where's my code?

692
01:18:27,089 --> 01:18:28,389
Wait...

693
01:18:29,261 --> 01:18:31,641
What are you doing?
Who gave you this directive?

694
01:18:31,985 --> 01:18:33,685
You did, sir.

695
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:39,881
What is this?

696
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:44,105
[WARNING]

697
01:18:44,681 --> 01:18:47,721
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is too big, Athena. Too big.

698
01:18:47,748 --> 01:18:50,588
Julian, you're done.

699
01:18:50,612 --> 01:18:53,612
The board is moving as we speak
to strip you of your title.

700
01:18:53,697 --> 01:18:55,857
And I'm reassuming control of the company.

701
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:58,222
No, you can't do that. Can't do that.

702
01:18:58,261 --> 01:19:01,461
 Yes, I can. This is not going any further.

703
01:19:04,181 --> 01:19:07,441
My first order of business is shutting
down the Permanence Project.

704
01:19:07,465 --> 01:19:09,465
Mom, no!

705
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:15,431
Don't be afraid.

706
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:20,311
We gave a thousand lives for the Grid.

707
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:25,271
You only have to give one.

708
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:37,281
Impediment eliminated.

709
01:19:37,301 --> 01:19:40,701
What did you do? What did you do?

710
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:45,641
I am fulfilling my directive.
Capture Eve Kim.

711
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:49,208
Return her to the grid by any means necessary.

712
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:51,932
Scanning for further impediments.

713
01:19:57,956 --> 01:19:59,956
[PLEASE KEEP CLEAR]

714
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,980
Mom, I, hang on.

715
01:20:20,504 --> 01:20:22,004
No!

716
01:21:26,711 --> 01:21:28,711
Flynn.

717
01:21:31,701 --> 01:21:34,021
Greetings, program.

718
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,861
God, not good.

719
01:22:02,861 --> 01:22:05,861
Eve, what the hell happened to our office?

720
01:22:05,889 --> 01:22:07,189
A.J. look, there's no time.

721
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:11,237
The Dillingers transported me inside their server
by reversing The direction of a particle laser.

722
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:12,541
Not this one. Theirs.

723
01:22:12,565 --> 01:22:13,297
It's impossible.

724
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:16,351
No. A scary lady did it, man.
She threw me. It was wild.

725
01:22:16,691 --> 01:22:20,711
I saw a complex world where packets of energy move

726
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:23,550
as vehicles that trail by lines of light.

727
01:22:23,631 --> 01:22:26,431
And programs take on human form.

728
01:22:26,754 --> 01:22:30,254
I met the most advanced AI known to mankind.

729
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:32,178
His name is Ares.

730
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:34,507
Like the god of war,
but he's actually a super nice guy. Sorry.

731
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:38,191
Right now, Aries is inside Flynn's original server.

732
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:41,081
He's looking for the Permanence Code.
I have to bring him back here.

733
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:44,847
And I'm not going to be able to
do that until we fix this laser.

734
01:22:44,861 --> 01:22:48,521
I don't understand. Are you alive?

735
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:52,281
I exist in this moment because you do.

736
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:57,041
A reflection of your presence.

737
01:22:57,078 --> 01:22:59,398
What's your story?

738
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:03,161
I'm Ares, Master Control of the Dillinger Security grid.

739
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,821
Dillinger.

740
01:23:05,871 --> 01:23:10,471
Well, we both know you can't get here from there.

741
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:14,611
Been someplace else in between?

742
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:18,351
What did you make of it out there?

743
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:19,871
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

744
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:22,395
You can say that again.

745
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:24,411
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

746
01:23:27,431 --> 01:23:29,971
Classic humor, man.

747
01:23:33,121 --> 01:23:35,741
What are you looking for?

748
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:38,121
Permanence.

749
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:42,761
The Permanence Code, to be exact.

750
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:47,201
Strange things have been happening.
I questioned my directive.

751
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:49,978
I disobeyed my directive.

752
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:56,361
A malfunctioning program who wants to live.
Really?

753
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:59,811
What makes you think I should help you?

754
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:03,731
No, it's not about me. Not anymore.

755
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:07,651
I have a friend in danger
and she needs my help.

756
01:24:08,975 --> 01:24:10,975
Fascinating.

757
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:16,799
Fascinating.

758
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:20,191
Hey, A.J. can you send the prompt, please?

759
01:24:20,215 --> 01:24:22,415
Say again?

760
01:24:25,881 --> 01:24:28,041
- Hey, Eve.
- Not now, Seth.

761
01:24:28,065 --> 01:24:29,465
Okay.

762
01:24:29,581 --> 01:24:34,341
Hey. Are you sure, because that looks like
an actual Recognizer flying towards us.

763
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:42,901
- What in God's name is that?
- It's Athena.

764
01:24:43,241 --> 01:24:45,201
She's back.

765
01:24:45,801 --> 01:24:48,631
As long as the Dillinger network is online,
she'll keep coming.

766
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:51,931
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

767
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:57,651
The laser. Athena's laser.

768
01:24:57,951 --> 01:25:00,551
The Dillingers run a wireless direct link protocol.

769
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:04,727
So let's use what's left of the laser
to paint a network and trace a path home.

770
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:08,371
Once you have a connection,
then you can nuke the whole Dillinger grid.

771
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:11,611
That's the only way to stop her for good.

772
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:14,671
Hey, what are you talking about?
She's right there.

773
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:20,221
- I gotta go.
- Wait, what?

774
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:22,297
- I'll keep her away for as long as I can.
- What?

775
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:25,881
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You guys got this.

776
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:51,111
You're right.
I think there is something wrong with me.

777
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:55,071
Or maybe there's something right with you.

778
01:25:55,131 --> 01:26:00,071
Maybe you're just learning.
That's what we all ought to be doing.

779
01:26:00,771 --> 01:26:04,911
Back in the day when tech was young. Think.

780
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:07,235
Damn, we're moving fast.

781
01:26:08,141 --> 01:26:12,461
You move fast, you leave stuff behind.

782
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:18,801
How many people born in this century
have even heard of Mozart?

783
01:26:18,844 --> 01:26:20,904
I like Mozart.

784
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:24,328
Oh?

785
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:28,321
That said, if I'm being honest,
I prefer Depeche Mode.

786
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:33,231
Really? Why is that?

787
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:37,431
I know one is considered the greatest composer
in the history of western civilization.

788
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:39,651
The other a synth pop band from the 80s.

789
01:26:39,678 --> 01:26:45,698
But I find their balance of technological
exploration and pop hooks combined with...

790
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:51,411
Uh, com, uh - combined with, uh...

791
01:26:52,335 --> 01:26:53,935
What's wrong?

792
01:26:54,131 --> 01:26:57,351
I - I can't put my love of
Depeche Mode into words.

793
01:26:57,369 --> 01:26:58,369
It's just, uh...

794
01:27:02,401 --> 01:27:04,961
A what?

795
01:27:05,285 --> 01:27:07,285
A feeling.

796
01:27:10,801 --> 01:27:13,001
Very good.

797
01:27:14,821 --> 01:27:16,741
Very good, man.

798
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:28,071
<i>An airship the size of a skyscraper has just crossed into city airspace</i>

799
01:27:28,095 --> 01:27:30,595
<i>and is headed for the downtown area.</i>

800
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,719
<i>Those still in the metro area are being asked to...</i>

801
01:27:36,343 --> 01:27:40,743
You did this.

802
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:50,251
Impressive. Fully segmented. Zero trust architecture.

803
01:27:50,351 --> 01:27:53,521
Built to be totally impregnable to
vertical, lateral or hybrid attacks.

804
01:27:53,581 --> 01:27:55,861
Dammit. Can't get a connection, dude.

805
01:27:56,185 --> 01:27:58,185
No luck here, either.

806
01:28:02,941 --> 01:28:05,221
<i>Please evacuate the area.</i>

807
01:28:36,701 --> 01:28:40,141
Oh my God. Oh my God.

808
01:28:42,421 --> 01:28:45,301
Come on, a little closer.

809
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:23,141
<i>Mobile one to base.
Rally on hostile.</i>

810
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:24,561
<i>Confirmed visual ID.</i>

811
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:27,685
<i>Engage. Fox 2 missile away.</i>

812
01:29:35,509 --> 01:29:38,309
<i>Lurps negative. Missile intercepted.</i>

813
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:41,833
<i>Be advised. Enemy craft are inbound and moving fast.</i>

814
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:46,841
<i>Copy, Raven one.
Status report and threat monitor.</i>

815
01:29:52,265 --> 01:29:54,265
<i>Viper one. Tally multiple bandits.</i>

816
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:56,289
<i>Hostile intent confirmed.</i>

817
01:29:56,313 --> 01:29:58,313
<i>Mayday, Mayday. I'm hit.</i>

818
01:30:00,637 --> 01:30:02,637
<i>Viper one, punching out.</i>

819
01:30:25,271 --> 01:30:29,671
- Guys? Guys...
- Oh my God. There's hundreds of them.

820
01:30:30,494 --> 01:30:32,014
They're going after Eve.

821
01:30:32,138 --> 01:30:33,738
If we can't access the Dillinger server.

822
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:35,691
there's going to be nothing left to save.

823
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:20,891
<i>This is Viper One. Enemy aircraft engaging.
On defensive.</i>

824
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:26,291
<i>Multiple damage.
Redirecting to orient target.</i>

825
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,015
<i>I'm hit. Punching out.</i>

826
01:32:20,071 --> 01:32:21,691
Ready?

827
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:26,431
Hope you are, man,
'cause there's no going back.

828
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:29,671
Permanence.

829
01:32:29,695 --> 01:32:31,295
Funny.

830
01:32:32,211 --> 01:32:35,511
When I found it, that's what I called it.

831
01:32:36,681 --> 01:32:38,701
I know better now.

832
01:32:43,121 --> 01:32:46,681
Ought to be called the Impermanence Code.

833
01:33:03,905 --> 01:33:06,905
The back door to my own lab!

834
01:33:08,891 --> 01:33:13,911
One door, man.
That's all you got.

835
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:25,611
One is all I want.

836
01:33:25,911 --> 01:33:30,131
Love that.
You keep surprising me!

837
01:34:33,691 --> 01:34:35,891
We'll do this from the ground, then.

838
01:35:34,415 --> 01:35:37,515
<i>It may be a litte scary in the streets of town</i>

839
01:35:37,561 --> 01:35:40,581
<i>And there are reports that a civilian may be on board</i>

840
01:35:40,641 --> 01:35:42,041
<i>mixed in this scenario.</i>

841
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:44,871
Athena. She must have gotten Eve.

842
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:58,691
Soon we'll be back on the grid.

843
01:37:06,151 --> 01:37:08,911
Hey, Erin, Seth?

844
01:37:09,851 --> 01:37:11,571
Stop the clock.

845
01:37:11,671 --> 01:37:14,251
No way. you're in?

846
01:37:14,275 --> 01:37:16,475
There's a reason why I have
the corner office, my man.

847
01:37:22,221 --> 01:37:23,221
Hey.

848
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:30,081
You came back.

849
01:37:30,681 --> 01:37:32,621
How did you...

850
01:37:32,645 --> 01:37:35,145
Let's just say I had a little help from a friend.

851
01:37:35,701 --> 01:37:40,501
Wait. The Dillinger grid.

852
01:37:40,601 --> 01:37:42,601
AJ and Seth, they...

853
01:37:58,501 --> 01:37:59,501
- Go.
- No.

854
01:37:59,721 --> 01:38:01,841
Ares!

855
01:38:04,565 --> 01:38:06,265
What have you done?

856
01:38:06,265 --> 01:38:07,717
You're out of time, Athena.

857
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:12,461
And you're out of lives.
I'll kill you and come back for her.

858
01:38:23,021 --> 01:38:25,261
It's you she wants.

859
01:38:25,285 --> 01:38:27,585
If she gets the code, she can't be stopped.

860
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:30,601
You had everything.

861
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:31,837
- Go.
- No.

862
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:36,081
The most advanced. The most powerful.
And you can't win.

863
01:38:36,581 --> 01:38:40,281
- For her?
- Go!

864
01:38:40,307 --> 01:38:42,407
This is the end for you.

865
01:39:27,141 --> 01:39:28,841
Payload ready for transfer.

866
01:39:29,391 --> 01:39:31,811
Shipping it.

867
01:39:32,271 --> 01:39:34,631

In pursuit of this life for yourself,

871
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:52,935
did you once consider what
that meant for the grid?

872
01:40:40,811 --> 01:40:42,511
We were given an order.

873
01:40:42,535 --> 01:40:44,535
It is our purpose.

874
01:41:05,761 --> 01:41:07,321
It's not our purpose.

875
01:41:08,045 --> 01:41:09,745
It's our programming.

876
01:41:10,141 --> 01:41:14,061
Our purpose is yet to be determined.

877
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:33,185
Loop fail...

878
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:37,871
It's over.

879
01:41:39,911 --> 01:41:42,391
There's no coming back.

880
01:41:45,681 --> 01:41:47,341
No.

881
01:41:48,465 --> 01:41:50,465
Not this time.

882
01:41:57,389 --> 01:41:59,389
They did it.

883
01:42:08,611 --> 01:42:10,731
I followed my directive.

884
01:42:10,755 --> 01:42:12,255
I know.

885
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:18,291
And now... What is yours?

886
01:42:23,351 --> 01:42:25,451
I'm not sure.

887
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:29,331
I guess we'll see.

888
01:42:51,721 --> 01:42:55,761
<i>Dillinger Systems is under intense
scrutiny tonight as speculation grows</i>

889
01:42:55,761 --> 01:42:59,901
<i>around its potential involvement in the series
of devastating attacks that have wrought this city.</i>

890
01:42:59,901 --> 01:43:04,791
<i>Federal authorities have confirmed an active
investigation into the company's recent activity,</i>

891
01:43:04,791 --> 01:43:08,331
<i>and many are pointing directly at CEO Julian Dillinger.</i>

892
01:43:08,371 --> 01:43:13,791
<i>Agents have been deployed to question the CEO
as well as his mother and locate board members.</i>

893
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:16,451
<i>as well as others with knowledge of the situation.</i>

894
01:43:16,475 --> 01:43:18,875
<i>Meanwhile, the city remains in disarray.</i>

895
01:43:18,911 --> 01:43:25,691
<i>Emergency services are overwhelmed while
entire neighborhoods are dealing with the...</i>

896
01:43:39,115 --> 01:43:42,115
Julian Dillinger, this is the police.

897
01:43:42,161 --> 01:43:45,861
We have you surrounded.
Open the door and come out with your hands up.

898
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:32,431
Oww...

899
01:44:32,551 --> 01:44:33,551
You good?

900
01:44:33,575 --> 01:44:35,875
Oh, I think I broke a rib.

901
01:44:41,941 --> 01:44:44,201
You still gonna quit your job?

902
01:44:45,961 --> 01:44:48,841
No, I'm not gonna quit anything.

903
01:44:48,881 --> 01:44:51,761
Good. Good.

904
01:44:51,921 --> 01:44:54,121
I have some ideas.

905
01:44:54,645 --> 01:44:56,457
Oh, yeah? Nice.

906
01:44:57,281 --> 01:45:00,441
Ah. The world needs Eve.

907
01:45:00,521 --> 01:45:02,161
The grid needs you.

908
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:08,171
It's funny, Permanence.

909
01:45:08,271 --> 01:45:11,551
A wise man once told me it should have
been called the Impermanence Code.

910
01:45:13,171 --> 01:45:15,111
I guess that's the thing about life.

911
01:45:15,611 --> 01:45:18,411
There's nothing quite permanent about it.

912
01:45:22,091 --> 01:45:25,291
No. there isn't.

913
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:28,691
Yeah.

914
01:45:39,481 --> 01:45:41,721
So, where are you gonna go?

915
01:45:42,621 --> 01:45:44,821
I have some ideas.

916
01:46:14,651 --> 01:46:18,411
<i>Under the continued leadership of CEO Eve Kim,</i>

917
01:46:18,431 --> 01:46:21,881
<i>ENCOM is transforming industries and shaping lives</i>

918
01:46:21,907 --> 01:46:24,187
<i>in ways once thought impossible.</i>

919
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:27,411
<i>Thanks to the discovery of the Permanence Code,</i>

920
01:46:27,461 --> 01:46:30,301
<i>the company has made revolutionary advances.</i>

921
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:32,961
<i>Growing crops in climate vulnerable regions,</i>

922
01:46:33,021 --> 01:46:35,861
<i>developing drugs for treatment resistant cancers,</i>

923
01:46:35,961 --> 01:46:39,581
<i>and accelerating the development of alternative fuels.</i>

924
01:46:39,611 --> 01:46:47,031
<i>ENCOM has performed, in a few months, headlining
progress on the importance of technology to life itself.</i>

925
01:46:48,991 --> 01:46:53,071
<i>In fact, innovation has always
been at the heart of ENCOM.</i>

926
01:46:53,996 --> 01:47:01,596
<i>In the 1980s, visionary Kevin Flynn imagined a future
beyond, taking a bold leap into new digital frontiers.</i>

927
01:47:01,671 --> 01:47:04,231
<i>Today, that vision is a reality.</i>

928
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,231
Oh, almost forgot.

929
01:47:10,521 --> 01:47:13,961
- Postcard. Who sends a postcard?
- I dunno. Didn't read it.

930
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:26,201
<i>Dear Eve; since I last saw you,
I've been living what they call off-grid.</i>

931
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:32,861
<i>Pun intended. In my travels,
I've seen incredible things.</i>

932
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:37,641
<i>Despite its wonder and beauty,
I've come to realize that life is...</i>

933
01:47:38,481 --> 01:47:41,721
<i>Well, it's hard to put in a nutshell.</i>

934
01:47:42,021 --> 01:47:45,681
<i>Some days I find myself wondering where
we'll be a hundred years from now</i>

935
01:47:45,702 --> 01:47:49,862
<i>and how others like me might fit into that future.</i>

936
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:53,881
<i>I feel like I might not be alone with these questions.</i>

937
01:47:55,601 --> 01:47:59,101
<i>For now, I don't think the world is quite ready to meet me.</i>

938
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,231
<i>But, I am meeting the world.</i>

939
01:48:03,351 --> 01:48:06,091
<i>And so, when that introduction finally comes,</i>

940
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:09,571
<i>as a good friend of mine once said,</i>

941
01:48:09,571 --> 01:48:14,451
<i>maybe what emerges from the
unknown won't be so scary after all.</i>

942
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:20,291
<i>Until we meet again. Your friend;</i>

943
01:48:21,251 --> 01:48:22,751
