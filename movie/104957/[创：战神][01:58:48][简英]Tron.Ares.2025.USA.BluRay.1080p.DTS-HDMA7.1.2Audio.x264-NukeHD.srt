我就再做一个给你
I will simply make you another.

代码那么精密
With all that sophisticated code,

148
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,500
你怎么控制得了它？
what makes you think you can contain it?

149

正在制造中
being built right now.

165

问题是...
The question is...

166
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,890
谁握有钥匙？
who's holding the keys?

167
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,130
好炫的小把戏
That was quite some parlor trick.

168
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,550
-时间？ -44秒
-Time? -Forty-four seconds.

169

170
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,430
那在剧本里 还是他即兴演出？
Was that in the script, or was he just having a moment?

我任期的市占率提升12% 几乎...
Market share was up 12% during my tenure. That's hardly...

177

总之我们不说“取代” 我们...
And anyway, we don't say "superseded," we...

178
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,130
称为“生孩子”
we call it "giving birth."

179

我发现你没有提到
I noticed you left out the part

183
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,110
你似乎无法让这家伙活着

不过董事会只会再支持你半年
However, the board will only stand behind you for another six months...

191
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,640
如果你运气好的话
if you're lucky.

192
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,390
要是不成功
But if it doesn't work...

193
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,650
这一切都会化为乌有 宝贝
all of this goes away, darling.

我们过去40年来打造的所有心血

真的吃不腻 很扯吧？
and, honestly, can't get enough. Isn't that wild?

199
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,700

又4天10小时32分
Yeah, and four days, ten hours, 32 minutes.

207
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,320
谁在算呢？
Who's counting, really, you know?

208
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
等一下
Hold on.

209
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,120
什么意思？
What do you mean?

210
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
怎样？
What?

-发现什么了吗？ -应该是

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,650
那行代码
The line of code.

216
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,820
那就是他的藏法 有两行

如果跟我想的一样

311
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,780

都有医疗突破和科学发现
there's a medical breakthrough, scientific discovery.

314
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,410
或许未知带来的事物没那么可怕
So maybe what emerges from the unknown isn't so scary.

315
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,080
如果它的重大缺陷只是仁慈呢？
What if its major malfunction is just benevolence?

316
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,420
这是什么？他在干嘛？

你撑得住 凯厄斯

-太扯了 -你看到了吗？

339
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,610
辛先生 你得跟我来

这是技术问题
This is a technical difficulty.

341

Sir, I'm curious why the Program Caius was not reconstituted.

347
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,350
我想知道你为何想知道
I'm curious why you are curious.

348
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,850
凯厄斯失能 所以被删除了
Caius was dysfunctional, so he was deleted.

349
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,990
跟任何不照指令运作的程序一样
Just like any program that operates outside their directive can be.

350
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,320
你懂吗？

看来全世界都知道

最好远离社群媒体几天

你想跟我玩？那就来玩

I heard about your cute little pitch to the board.

362
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,980
但你漏了一个关键细节
But you left off one key detail from your deck.

363
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,070
你有说进攻时间只有29分钟吗？
Did you tell them the shot clock expires at 29 minutes?

364
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,360
别逼我向报社爆料
Don't make me call The Journal and tell them

365
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,990
你的承诺无法实现
you're making promises you can't keep.

366
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,200
承诺？
Promises?

367
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,330
就像你们说首席执行官会在办公室坐镇吗？
What, you mean like the one that your CEO will be in office running the company?

368
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,200
事有蹊跷吧 亚杰？
Something in the water over there, Ajay?

369
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,710
先是山姆·费林 现在是他的继位者
I mean, first, wonder boy Sam Flynn, now his successor.

370
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,630
她在哪 亚杰？你知道吗？
Where is she, Ajay? Do you even know where she is?

371
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,960
也许你说得对
Maybe you're right.

372
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,460
也许伊芙疯了
Maybe Eve went nuts.

373
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,720
也许她擅离职守出国 也许...
Maybe she went AWOL and left the country, or maybe...

374
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,220
她是躲起来 跟你找同样的东西
she's holed up off the grid looking for the same thing you are.

375
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,680
我知道我会赌谁赢
And I know who my money's on.

376
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,560
如果你今晚过后还有钱
You mean what's left of it after tonight.

377
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,850
通话结束
End of line!

378
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,310

I hate that man.

Thank you so much.

380
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,400
那些柳橙是我做的 说来话长

387
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,550
我们的服务器被暴力破解
A brute force attack took down our servers

388
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,090
就在重大产品发表会上

389
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,390
我们建立的一切都垮了 你得马上回来
Everything we've built is melting down. You need to get back here right now.

390

我找到了 亚杰 是真的
I found it, Ajay. It's real.

391
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,810
就在黛丝认定的地方 一直都在费林手上
Right where Tess thought it would be. Flynn had it all along.

392
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,190
你是说永恒代码？

对 已经超过四小时了

他一定知道 伊芙
He must know, Evie.

398
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,370
我跟刚狄林杰谈过

399
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,950
等等 你跟狄林杰谈过？

他在找代码 他认为你也是

402
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,000

我正要去英克尔

407
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,140
我们要重新推出《疯狂空间》

00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,610
可是 提取永恒代码
But, sir, extracting the Permanence Code

566
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,990
会将载体从创界网络和您的世界删除
would delete the carrier from the Grid and from your world.

567
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,080
执行这项命令

568
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,130
将无法复原

569
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,010
很久以前 有一种武器叫战神
Once upon a time, there was a weapon and its name was Ares.

570
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,880
战神对朱利安·狄林杰言听计从
And Ares obeyed every command of Julian Dillinger,

571
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,550
朱利安·狄林杰赚进一兆元
and Julian Dillinger made a trillion dollars.

572
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,560
还用鲜血让他在历史上留名
And wrote his name on the face of time in blood.

573
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,930
无论这些感受来自什么操作错误
Now, whatever PEBKAC error is behind these feelings,

574
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,270
我都会找到它 把它从你身上剔除
I'm going to find it and rip it out of you.

575
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,360
我说得清楚吗？
Do I make myself clear?

576
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,570
十分清楚
Perfectly.

577
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,660
程序退下
Program dismissed.

578
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,000
那个怪物也说：“我无所畏惧
The creature also said, "I am fearless,

579
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,500
因而强大”

580
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,850
-如何？ -使用者身体不适
-Well? -The user is indisposed.

581
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,560
静候指令再提取

582
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,970
-身体不适？ -正确
-Indisposed? -Correct.

583
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,850
请定义 身体不适

584
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,610
他困在车阵中
He's stuck in traffic.

585
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,190
不 他在歌剧院
No, he's at the opera.

586
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,110
他穿着绿色袜子站在富士山顶
He's standing on the top of Mount Fuji in a pair of green socks

587
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,200
用曼陀林演奏《带手枪的妈妈》
playing "Pistol Packin' Mama" on the mandolin.

588
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,080
我已经下达命令
I gave you an order.

589
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,950
创造者身体不适
The creator's indisposed.

590
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,410
等我们收到进一步指令再提取
Hold extraction until we receive further directive.

591
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,380
我说得清楚吗？
Do I make myself clear?

592
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,340
清楚 长官
Yes, sir.

593
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,590
程序们退下
Programs dismissed.

594
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,100
我能信任你吗？
Can I trust you?

595
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,110
这问题很复杂 你有多少时间？
It's a complicated question. How much time you got?

596
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,770
60秒 快回答 你的生命周期就靠它了
Sixty seconds. Answer now. Your life cycle depends upon it.

597
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,740
我没有生命周期

598
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,530
你有 还剩下54秒

600
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,040
我希望可以 但应该不行
I'd like to think so, but probably not.

601
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,210
雅典娜 传来信息

602
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,550

长官 主控出现故障迹象

604
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,940
指令受到的威胁都必须铲除

-And Julian Dillinger? -You can't trust him.

608
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,290
他认为所有人事物都可以牺牲
For him, everyone and everything is expendable.

609
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,620
我失算了
I miscalculated.

610
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,000
我们有新指令
We have a new directive.

611
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,250
雅典娜 没必要这样
Athena, it doesn't have to be like this.

612

删除他

613
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,410

他们要前往转移入口

狄林杰叫你删除我？
Dillinger told you to delete me?

625
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,560
抓紧
Hang on!

632

-理论上？ -应该吧

不是给狄林杰

我们说定了吗？
So, do we have a deal?

646

992
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,270
好 你确定吗？
Okay. Hey, are you sure?

993
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,980
好像有一架识别者往这边飞来
Because that looks like an actual Recognizer flying towards us.

994
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:39,200
那是什么东西？
What in God's name is that?

995
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,160
是雅典娜
It's Athena.

996
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:41,990
她回来了
She's back.

997
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,200
只要狄林杰网络上线 她就会一直来
As long as the Dillinger Network is online, she'll keep coming.

998
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:49,380
抓到我 她就能得到永恒代码
If she gets me, she gets the Permanence Code.

999
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,300
激光 雅典娜的激光
The laser. Athena's laser!

1000
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,800
狄林杰使用一种无线直连协定
The Dillingers run a wireless direct link protocol,

1001
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,930
我们用剩下的激光探测 追溯返航路径
so let's use what's left of the laser to ping the network and trace a path home.

1002
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,430
一旦连线 就能破坏整个狄林杰网络
Once you have a connection, then you can nuke the whole Dillinger Grid.

1003
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:08,140
那是唯一彻底阻止她的方法
And that's the only way to stop her for good.

1004
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:10,900
伊芙 你在说什么？她就在那里
Eve, what are you talking about? She's right there.

1005
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,780
-我该走了 -等等 什么？
-I gotta go. -Wait, what?

1006
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,780
我会尽量牵制她
I'll keep her away for as long as I can.

1007
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,860
-什么？ -我帮你们争取时间
-What? -I'm gonna buy you some time.

1008
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,620
-伊芙 -你们可以的
-Eve... -You guys got this.

1009
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:37,550
追踪目标中 伊芙·金

1010
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,850
没错 我应该有问题
You're right. I think there is something wrong with me.

1011
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:51,440
或者 也许你有好的地方
Or maybe there's something right with you.

1012
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,770
也许你只是在学习
Well, maybe you're just learning.

1013
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,820
我们都应该那么做
That's what we all ought to be doing.

1014
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,530
当年科技刚开始萌芽时
Back in the day, when tech was young,

1015
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,780
我会想：“我们进展得好快”
I'd think, "Damn, we're moving fast."

1016
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,910
进展快 就会抛下一些东西
You move fast, you leave stuff behind.

1017
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:14,790
这世纪出生的人有多少个听过莫札特？
How many people born in this century have even heard of Mozart?

1018
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,840
我喜欢莫札特
I like Mozart.

1019
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,220
哦？
Oh?

1020
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:24,680
但老实说 我比较喜欢流行尖端
That said, if I'm being honest, I prefer Depeche Mode.

1021
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,600
是吗？怎么说？
Really? Why is that?

1022
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,770
一个被誉为西方文明史上
I know one is considered the greatest composer

1023
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,730
最伟大的作曲家
in the history of Western civilization,

1024
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,150
一个是80年代的合成流行乐团
the other a synth pop band from the '80s,

1025
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:41,070
但他们的音乐兼具实验性与流行元素
but I find their balance of technological exploration and pop hooks

1026
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,450
再加上...
combined with...

1027
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,080
再加上...
combined with...

1028
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,950
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1029
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:53,370
我无法用言语形容对流行尖端的喜爱
I can't put my love of Depeche Mode into words.

1030
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,210
那只是...
It's just a...

1031
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,760
什么？
A what?

1032
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,920
一种感觉
A feeling.

1033
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,850
非常好
Very good.

1034
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:12,680
非常好
Very good, man.

1035
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:23,780
一艘大如摩天楼的飞船刚进入本市领空
An airship the size of a skyscraper has just crossed into the city's airspace

1036
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,490
并前往市区...
and is headed for the downtown area...

1037
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,280
你...
You...

1038
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:35,500
是你造成的
You did this.

1039
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,510
今晚 军方...
And tonight, as military...

1040
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:45,680
了不起 完全分段的零信任架构

01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:48,590
可以抵御垂直 横向或混合攻击
Built to be totally impregnable to vertical, lateral or hybrid attacks.

1042
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,060
狄林杰网络 连线中断

1043
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,680
-可恶 连不上 -这里也是
-Damn it. Can't get a connection, dude. -No luck here either.

1044
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,980
遭拒

1045
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:58,440
疯狂空间

1046
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,480
请立即撤离本区域
Please evacuate the area.

1047
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,550
-那是什么？找反恐特警组 -请求支援
-What is that thing? Bring in SWAT! -Requesting backup.

1048
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,220
天啊
Oh, my God.

1049
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,480
天啊
Oh, my God!

1050
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,360
来啊 再靠近一点
Come on. A little closer.

1051
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,780
伊芙·金

1052
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,810
毒蛇一号呼叫基地 看见敌方

他们在追伊芙
They're going after Eve.

1066
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,550
进不了狄林杰服务器就没东西可救了
If we can't access the Dillinger server, there's gonna be nothing left to save.

1075
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:30,290
我发现它时就是这么叫它
When I found it, that's what I called it.

1076
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:33,630

1077

1090
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:40,360
代表可能有人遭到挟持

1091
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,940
雅典娜 她一定抓到伊芙了

我用角落办公室是有原因的

你做了什么？
What have you done?

1112
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,130
你没时间了 雅典娜

我会杀了你 再回来找她

让她拿到代码就完了
If she gets the code, she can't be stopped.

1117
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:29,820
你曾拥有一切
You had everything.

1118
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,320
-快跑 -不
-Go. -No.

1119
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:35,120
最先进 最强大的能力 你却轻易放弃
The most advanced, the most powerful, and you gave it away.

1120
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,240
为了她？
For her?

1121
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,450

Go!

1122
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,540

为了自己追求生命
In pursuit of this life for yourself,

1130
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:53,200
你考虑过这对创界网络的影响吗？
did you once consider what that meant for the Grid?

1131
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:44,790
我们接到命令 它是我们的使命

有个智者说它应该叫“短暂代码”
A wise man once told me it should have been called the "Impermanence Code."

1192

没有什么是永恒的

1216
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:19,180
我没看
Didn't read it.

1217
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,190
亲爱的伊芙
Dear Eve,

1218
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:27,520
自从上次见到你

01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,200
我都过着所谓的“外网络”生活
I've been living what they call "off-grid."

1220
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,280

我在旅行中见到不可思议的事物

Despite its wonder and beauty, I've come to realize that life is...

1223

呃 一言难尽
Well, it's hard to put in a nutshell.

1224
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,800
有时我会想百年后我们会在哪里
Some days, I find myself wondering where we'll be a hundred years from now

1225
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,510
神秘伙伴在英克尔有何角色？

1226
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:54,470
跟我同类的人如何融入未来

我觉得可能不只有我有这些疑问
I feel like I might not be alone with these questions.

1228

现在 我想世人还没准备好要认识我
For now, I don't think the world is quite ready to meet me,

1229
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:08,070
但我正在认识这个世界
