1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
The Grid.

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,070
A digital frontier.

3
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,400
A world beyond the screen as real as our own.

4
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,820
I can picture it.

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,070
Clusters of information rising like cities.

6
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,860
Programs as complex as you and me.

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,360
In just a few years,we're gonna be able to enter this world.

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,240
And a few years after that,

9
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,070
well, this world will come into ours.

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,990
Intelligent life from inside the machine.

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,320
I, for one, can't wait to meet it.

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,650
Our lead story,

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,900
Encom CEO and video game icon Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,450
He was best known for designing Tron and Space Paranoids,

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,700
the best-selling video games in history.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,820
The company that started at Kevin Flynn's arcade in the 1980s

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,530
has faced years of corporate turmoil.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,070
Can it find its way to the victory screen once again?

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,320
It's a sister-act for Encom.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,610
Eve and Tess Kim take the reins of the massive tech company

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,450
after Sam Flynn resigns for personal reasons.

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,150
Encom's rebound under the Kim sisters' leadership

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,570
has competitors rushing to respond.

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,860
Software giant Dillinger Systems appoints its new CEO Julian Dillinger,

25
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,530
who vows to restore his grandfather's legacy.

26
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,490
The race between Encom and Dillinger Systems heats up

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,320
as new CEOs Julian Dillinger and the Kim sisters square off.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,150
Here at Encom, we believe the beauty of AI

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,860
is not the ability to build smarter weapons,

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,900
but to uplift humanity,

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,700
feed the hungry, cure the sick, educate the world.

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,030
Rival CEOs Julian Dillinger and Eve Kim have gone quiet in recent months,

33
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,990
raising speculation the two companies

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,110
are very close to a substantial technological breakthrough.

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,990
One that has the potential to transform humanity

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,280
in ways we have never seen before.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,030
The future may well lie in the hands of whoever gets there first.

38
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,700
Welcome.

39
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,150
Who are you?

40
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,820
I am your creator.

41
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,200
And who am I?

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,780
Not "who." What.

43
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,860
You are Dillinger Systems security software.

44
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,110
Program name, Ares. Defender of the Grid.

45
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,360
You are Master Control.

46
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,110
Ares.

47
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,990
I am Master Control.

48
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,700
So, you made it.

49
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,150
I had a feeling that you would.

50
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,950
I always dreamed that we would do this together.

51
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,990
I'll admit, not exactly like this.

52
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,450
But I'm glad you're here.

53
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm really glad.

54
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,950
And, Evie, remember I'm still here.

55
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,200
Even if you can't see me.

56
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,400
I love you.

57
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,610
Oh, my God.

58
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Eve.

59
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,490
Not sure you actually told me we'd be stealing energy

60
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,650
from the power grid.

61
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,860
Wow. So this is where she kept coming back to, huh?

62
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,950
To be this disconnected from the world? That is dedication, my friend.

63
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Wow.

64
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,990
Looks like your sister had a little crush.

65
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,240
Yeah. She was so sure Flynn left us the answer.

66
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,610
Like on a floppy disk?

67
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,530
Poor Flynn lived before the cloud, huh.

68
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,240
Hey, are you still gonna be doing CEO-type stuff while we're out here?

69
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
You know, like, earnings calls, and the launch of Panic City and stuff.

70
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,070
Let's just get this done.

71
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,360
Dude, I can make breakfast burritos right here. Hell, yeah.

72
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,570
This is for you, Tess.

73
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,360
Members of the board,

74
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,530
for over 40 years, my family at Dillinger Systems

75
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,400
has battled Encom for control of the future.

76
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,240
You put me in charge of the company to ensure our victory.

77
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Today,

78
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,610
I make it so.

79
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,450
Imagine if all our digital prowess wasn't just digital.

80
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,110
What if anything we could dream in the machine

81
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,900
could become a reality here?

82
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,110
What if we could build the bridge between two previously walled-off worlds?

83
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,360
So much talk of AI in big tech today.

84
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,990
Virtual worlds, what are they gonna look like?

85
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,320
When will we get there?

86
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,400
Well, folks. We're not going there.

87
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,700
They are coming here.

88
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,820
Attention, please put on your safety glasses now.

89
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,990
Laser systems activated. Power fluctuations are nominal.

90
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,740
Warning, stand clear.

91
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,360
Outputting from Dillinger Systems server.

92
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,820
Raw material inflow initiated.

93
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,990
T-minus ten, nine,

94
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,400
eight, seven,

95
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,490
six, five,

96
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,110
four, three, two, one...

97
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,780
Transfer complete.

98
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,650
I present the Dillinger Systems Amphibious Rapid-response Tank.

99
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,860
The DART.

100
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,450
Digitally modeled inside our server,

101
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,530
output using our patented laser technology.

102
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,320
There's an M1 rifle gun. Two M240 machine guns.

103
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
It's got a top speed of 75 miles per hour.

104
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,490
Durability, you find a wall, this thing is gonna drive through it.

105
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,320
This is full-scale war, five minutes' notice.

106
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,070
So, if we can create the hardware of the future,

107
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,240
then why not the soldier to operate it?

108
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,900
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to meet Ares.

109
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,740
This is the most sophisticated security program ever written.

110
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,610
You wanna shake his hand? Go ahead. He doesn't bite.

111
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,150
Ares has billions of lines of code unique to him.

112
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,320
Is it alive?

113
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,070
That depends on your definition, Stuart.

114
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,950
Because unlike you, he's biblically strong,

115
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,570
lightning fast, and supremely intelligent.

116
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,860
He is fully proprietary and 100% expendable.

117
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,780
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

118
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,650
He needs no food, no water, sheds no blood.

119
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,490
And if, by some miracle, he is struck down on the battlefield,

120
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,360
I will simply make you another.

121
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,950
With all that sophisticated code,

122
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,900
what makes you think you can contain it?

123
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,780
I can assure you, General,

124
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,610
the most advanced fail-safe mechanisms

125
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,280
and restriction protocols are in place.

126
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Ares is predictable, controllable and fully aligned.

127
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
Southerly front with isentropic lift, turning cyclonic.

128
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,820
Predicted precipitation, 2.6 inches.

129
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,990
I hope that you brought your umbrellas.

130
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,030
I have to hand it to you, Julian.

131
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,240
You promised a big win

132
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,860
and this is even bigger than any of us could've imagined.

133
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Thank you.

134
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,740
My grandfather started Dillinger Corporation

135
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,530
long before anybody heard the term "cybersecurity."

136
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,860
Military AI is the future.

137
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,490
The question is not whether the car should be built. The car is...

138
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,860
being built right now.

139
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,610
The question is...

140
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,240
who's holding the keys?

141
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,450
That was quite some parlor trick.

142
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,860
-Time? -Forty-four seconds.

143
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,450
"I hope you brought your umbrellas."

144
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,650
Was that in the script, or was he just having a moment?

145
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,820
Elisabeth Dillinger, eldest daughter of founder Edward Dillinger, deceased.

146
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,280
Longtime CEO during a relatively unremarkable period

147
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,530
of corporate history before being superseded by your only son.

148
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,490
It's a pleasure.

149
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,570
Unremarkable?

150
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,450
Market share was up 12% during my tenure. That's hardly...

151
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,280
And anyway, we don't say "superseded," we...

152
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,320
we call it "giving birth."

153
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Of course.

154
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,360
It's an honor to meet my creator's creator.

155
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,030
Oh, here we go.

156
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,740
I noticed you left out the part

157
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,280
where you can't seem to keep this thing of yours alive

158
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,570
-for more than 25 minutes. -Twenty-nine.

159
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,360
Deceiving your investors, Julian, is hardly a business model.

160
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,570
Whoever controls the Permanence Code, controls the future.

161
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,150
We have to win.

162
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,360
Look, I...

163
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,360
admire your vision. Straighten up.

164
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,400
However, the board will only stand behind you for another six months...

165
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,860
if you're lucky.

166
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,610
But if it doesn't work...

167
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,860
all of this goes away, darling.

168
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,610
Everything we have built for the past 40 years.

169
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,490
What if I said I had found a way?

170
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,240
I think this is my 95th breakfast burrito,

171
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,320
and, honestly, can't get enough. Isn't that wild?

172
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,860
Well...

173
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,650
Nice to see Tess wasn't the only obsessive one in the family.

174
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,150
Yeah, Seth, you're right.

175
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,490
Sorry, I should pay more attention to you. Don't worry about it.

176
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Okay.

177
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,900
-I'm sorry. -Get out of here.

178
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,700
Look, three months in subzero is a long time, I get it.

179
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,070
Yeah, and four days, ten hours, 32 minutes.

180
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,450
Who's counting, really, you know?

181
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Hold on.

182
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,240
What do you mean?

183
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
What?

184
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Seth.

185
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,320
-You found something? -I think so.

186
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,650
The line of code.

187
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,900
That's how he hid it, it's two lines.

188
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,990
That looks like a double helix.

189
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,990
It is a double helix.

190
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,780
Tess would've loved this.

191
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,570
Wait. Are you serious? So no more "29 minutes and out"?

192
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,780
If this is what I think it is,

193
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,360
it's the Permanence Code.

194
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
Okay.

195
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,740
Encom offline trial 317a-1. Permanence Code implemented.

196
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,320
Testing for asset stability beyond current 29-minute barrier.

197
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,450
Go.

198
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,530
-Ready when you are. -Okay.

199
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,900
It's all in the wrists, baby.

200
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,240
That never gets old.

201
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,070
Trial commenced. Twenty-nine minutes and counting down.

202
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,200
Let's see if you last this time.

203
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,570
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

204
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,030
If by some miracle he is struck down on the battlefield,

205
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,950
I will simply make you another.

206
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,650
Fully proprietary, 100%...

207
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,400
expendable.

208
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,700
-Athena. -Welcome back, sir.

209
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,070
All units are online and ready for inspection.

210
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,280
So how was it?

211
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,200
It was interesting. Different this time.

212
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,950
I met a mother and a son.

213
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,400
It was raining.

214
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,240
The condensed moisture of the atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops.

215
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,650
I could almost feel it.

216
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,240
Feel? I don't understand.

217
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,530
This is Eve. Get sensible and text.

218
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,990
Hey, Eve. It's Erin. Got Ajay for you again. Hit us back.

219
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,360
Still straight to voicemail.

220
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,900
CEO of a Fortune 500 company

221
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,200
and your phone's down on our biggest night?

222
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,700
Goddamn it. Where the hell are you, Eve?

223
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,860
All right, Paranoia-Con!

224
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:54,280
In five, four, three, two, one.

225
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,490
Did we just do it? Dude, it's still there!

226
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,240
Dude, we just changed the world, man!

227
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,110
You did it, Eve! Oh, my God, you did it.

228
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
Big news out of Encom tonight.

229
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,650
CEO Eve Kim will not attend the highly anticipated launch event

230
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,650
for the company's new game, Space Paranoids: Panic City.

231
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,280
Kim, the visionary designer

232
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,280
behind the relaunch of the blockbuster franchise...

233
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Well, I spoke to several of our board members,

234
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,570
and needless to say they are impressed.

235
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Julian.

236
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,150
-Just carry on. -Yes, sir.

237
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,360
-What are you doing? -Just trying to change the world, Mother.

238
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,860
What's going on?

239
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,360
You're hacking Encom?

240
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,610
Just a peek over the garden wall. No one will notice.

241
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,860
What makes you think that Encom is any closer to finding it?

242
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,240
Because I know who else is looking for it, all right?

243
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,450
Who?

244
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Eve Kim.

245
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,780
She's following in her sister's footsteps.

246
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,070
She's after the Permanence Code. I can feel it.

247
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,150
So I'm gonna find her, and when I do...

248
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,570
No, I don't like it. It's too risky, Julian.

249
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Oops.

250
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,820
Security breach in all zones.

251
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,610
Programs, our directive is clear.

252
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,820
Penetrate the server core and extract Eve Kim's user file.

253
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,950
Live in five, four, three...

254
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,570
Space Paranoids fans, are you ready?

255
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,070
Put your hands together for Encom CTO, Ajay Singh!

256
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,280
-It's cowboy time. -Oh, no.

257
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,820
Nice to see you!

258
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,900
Hello.

259
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,070
Thank you.

260
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,820
What's up, Paranoia-Con?

261
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,780
I'm going in.

262
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,450
I'm in.

263
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm a genius! Who knew you raised a genius, Mother?

264
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,860
I'm in!

265
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,530
In deep shit.

266
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,530
Initiate containment protocols and pull all network access.

267
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,200
We need a response now.

268
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,450
Initiate security protocol.

269
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,280
People are trusting artificial intelligence with their lives.

270
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,990
Are you comfortable with this?

271
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,280
Well, look.

272
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,700
For every doomsday scenario,

273
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,110
there's a medical breakthrough, scientific discovery.

274
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,900
So maybe what emerges from the unknown isn't so scary.

275
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,650
What if its major malfunction is just benevolence?

276
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,900
What is this? What's he doing?

277
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,700
But still, would you prefer to talk to a real person?

278
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,610
Of course, but what if that person is no longer in your life?

279
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,700
No longer here?

280
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,860
I've got the file.

281
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Congratulations.

282
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,150
Now get out of there while you still can.

283
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,990
Programs, we fight.

284
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,070
Yes!

285
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,150
Thank you so much.

286
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,360
What do Paranoiacs do?

287
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,570
Grind you into dust!

288
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,820
Caius.

289
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,820
He's dysfunctional. Leave him.

290
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,360
You're gonna make it, Caius.

291
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,610
Sometimes you have to sacrifice your knight to expose their queen.

292
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,070
...to debut the latest version

293
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,530
of Space Paranoids: Panic City with the world.

294
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,740
-What's up, bro? -What is that?

295
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,990
-This is crazy. -Have you seen this?

296
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,950
Mr. Singh, you need to come with me.

297
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,490
This is a technical difficulty.

298
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,700
-We'll be back. -This way, sir.

299
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,070
Everything's gone down.

300
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,860
Well done, Master Control.

301
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,990
Eve Kim's file acquired.

302
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,700
Objective achieved.

303
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,530
Sir, I'm curious why the Program Caius was not reconstituted.

304
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,740
I'm curious why you are curious.

305
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,240
Caius was dysfunctional, so he was deleted.

306
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,360
Just like any program that operates outside their directive can be.

307
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,700
Do you understand?

308
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,360
Acknowledge, Master Control.

309
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,150
Of course.

310
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,900
We are 100% expendable.

311
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,200
New mission, Master Control. Locate Eve Kim.

312
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Yes, sir.

313
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,700
Seems like we had a little cyber breach, Jules.

314
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,780
But then of course you knew that.

315
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,530
It looks like the whole world knows, buddy.

316
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,030
Might wanna stay off the socials for a few days.

317
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,110
You wanna play games with me? Let's play games, Julian.

318
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,700
I heard about your cute little pitch to the board.

319
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,240
But you left off one key detail from your deck.

320
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,400
Did you tell them the shot clock expires at 29 minutes?

321
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,610
Don't make me call The Journal and tell them

322
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,240
you're making promises you can't keep.

323
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,450
Promises?

324
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,570
What, you mean like the one that your CEO will be in office running the company?

325
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,450
Something in the water over there, Ajay?

326
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,950
I mean, first, wonder boy Sam Flynn, now his successor.

327
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,860
Where is she, Ajay? Do you even know where she is?

328
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,200
Maybe you're right.

329
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,700
Maybe Eve went nuts.

330
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,030
Maybe she went AWOL and left the country, or maybe...

331
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,530
she's holed up off the grid looking for the same thing you are.

332
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,900
And I know who my money's on.

333
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,780
You mean what's left of it after tonight.

334
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,150
End of line!

335
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,610
I hate that man.

336
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,200
Thank you so much.

337
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,700
You know, I made those oranges. It's a long story.

338
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,700
Stop, stop, stop.

339
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,950
What are you doing?

340
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,740
-1913 messages. Popular. -Wow.

341
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
-Me? -It's Ajay. Yeah, that's you.

342
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,780
-Ajay, are you there? -Am I here?

343
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,740
A brute force attack took down our servers

344
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,280
during our biggest product launch in years.

345
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,570
Everything we've built is melting down. You need to get back here right now.

346
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,150
I found it, Ajay. It's real.

347
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,990
Right where Tess thought it would be. Flynn had it all along.

348
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,360
Are you talking about the Permanence Code?

349
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,700
Yeah. Four hours and counting.

350
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,070
Zero degradation, no instability. It's incredible.

351
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,240
Wait a second. Did you say four hours?

352
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,030
-Yeah, four hours. -My God.

353
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,200
He must know, Evie.

354
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,110
-I just spoke to Dillinger. -Wait. You just spoke to Dillinger?

355
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,070
He's looking for the code, and he thinks you are too.

356
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,700
We gotta move on this.

357
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,650
-Eve, you've done a great thing. -Tess did a great thing.

358
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,990
I'm en route to Encom.

359
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,530
We'll secure the code, I have it with me on a drive.

360
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,280
We're relaunching Paranoia!

361
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,030
Boy, it's your birthday. Boy, it's your birthday.

362
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,490
-Yeah! Ajay. -Boy, it's your birthday.

363
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,530
Yo, what's up, Eve? You've got some news for the freaks at home?

364
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,740
Hi.

365
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,530
"I am fearless, and therefore powerful."

366
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:19,030
So, apparently we just sold our ten millionth unit!

367
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,280
Evie, Space Paranoids.

368
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,030
Kevin Flynn, wherever the hell he is, has a big smile on his face.

369
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,950
You crushed it.

370
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
No...

371
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,150
Happy birthday to you

372
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,860
Happy birthday to you

373
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,400
Happy birthday, dear Tess

374
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,700
Happy birthday to you

375
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,950
Breaking news.

376
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,110
Encom's Head of Special Projects, Tess Kim, died today

377
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,110
after a long battle with cancer.

378
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,900
Her sister, Eve Kim, could not be reached for comment.

379
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,570
Permanence.

380
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,200
Checkmate.

381
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,240
And so our heroes venture off into the night.

382
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,740
Nothing but the clothes on their backs

383
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,900
and a six-million-dollar particle laser that creates organic material

384
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,110
out of nowhere, which is kind of crazy, right?

385
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,110
Keep the equipment safe and just... lay low.

386
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,450
-Okay? -Yeah.

387
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,450
Hey.

388
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,990
We got this.

389
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,900
Launch directive on countdown one. Comm check.

390
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,360
GNC on countdown one. Comm check.

391
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,700
Printing in progress.

392
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,860
Stage one. Chamber pressure is nominal.

393
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,280
Envac engine chill has begun.

394
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,070
Stage one load is complete.

395
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,240
Transfer complete.

396
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,280
You have 29 minutes to bring me Eve Kim.

397
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,780
Asset deployment confirmed. Vehicles en route.

398
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,150
Target identified.

399
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,860
Goddamn it. I'm awesome!

400
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,950
Intercepting now.

401
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
Eyes on the target.

402
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,110
What?

403
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,030
You, on the motorcycle!

404
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,110
Pull over.

405
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Come on.

406
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,450
Where'd she go?

407
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,530
Come on!

408
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,570
Okay.

409
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,610
Come on. Come on.

410
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,030
Oh, my God.

411
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,200
Come on. Come on.

412
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
What?

413
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,450
Okay.

414
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,110
Oh, my God. Okay.

415
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,320
Oh, my God!

416
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,950
Prepare the particle laser.

417
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,650
Time to move to plan B.

418
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,530
Yes, sir.

419
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,150
Come on.

420
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,030
Come on.

421
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,860
Yeah.

422
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,900
Oh, yeah. You wanna play?

423
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,490
What are you?

424
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,530
I am Master Control.

425
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,610
What do you want?

426
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,150
I want the code.

427
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,070
Well, it's gone.

428
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,280
No, it's not.

429
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,360
I have her in my sights.

430
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,240
Establishing connection to the Grid now.

431
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,700
Ready to transfer in T-minus 15 seconds.

432
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,110
You're... a program.

433
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,740
You're timing out.

434
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,150
Get on the ground!

435
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:24,780
Transfer her into the Grid.

436
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,150
I'm on the ground in downtown.

437
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,150
And I can tell you, this was no elaborate stunt.

438
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,900
-Three riders... -What have you done?

439
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,400
How could you be so reckless?

440
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,450
When the world sees what I have created,

441
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,400
all will be forgiven.

442
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,780
Is that what you think?

443
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:57,700
You think that you're in control of this?

444
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,030
You're not.

445
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,950
Believing we can change the world is what keeps this company relevant.

446
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,650
But it's also what can burn it to the ground.

447
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,490
And your job is knowing the difference.

448
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,740
Transfer of biological life-form in progress.

449
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,240
Digital reconstruction initiated.

450
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,490
Twenty percent digitized.

451
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,820
Forty percent digitized.

452
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,950
Sixty-five percent digitized.

453
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,150
Ninety-five percent digitized.

454
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,030
Digitization complete.

455
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,320
Run diagnostics and scan for corruption.

456
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,860
Eve Kim identity disk activated.

457
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,820
Wow.

458
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,780
Where am I?

459
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,950
Dillinger Systems Central Processing Unit.

460
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,280
Wait. What?

461
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,490
We have identified the sequence.

462
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,320
The user possesses the code.

463
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
The code?

464
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:58,490
The code? I don't have the code. I destroyed the drive.

465
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,070
Silence, user.

466
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,110
The code isn't only on a drive. The code is inside of you.

467
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,820
Whether you remember it or not, you've seen it and that is enough.

468
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,490
-But I-- -Sir, her disk shows signs of instability.

469
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,070
Define instability.

470
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,700
Extraction of the code may result in de-resolution of the carrier.

471
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,110
The directive is clear.

472
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,990
Isolate the thread and commence extraction.

473
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:19,900
Copy.

474
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,610
Wait. No, no, no.

475
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,780
Stop.

476
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,740
Athena is correct.

477
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,200
There's only one user whose directive we follow.

478
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,200
What will remain of the user if she were to suffer de-resolution?

479
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,200
Nothing, sir.

480
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,450
No trace of her existence on the Grid?

481
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,570
None, sir.

482
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,360
Extract the code and delete the carrier.

483
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,650
But, sir, extracting the Permanence Code

484
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,110
would delete the carrier from the Grid and from your world.

485
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,030
Once upon a time, there was a weapon and its name was Ares.

486
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:35,900
And Ares obeyed every command of Julian Dillinger,

487
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,570
and Julian Dillinger made a trillion dollars.

488
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:42,650
And wrote his name on the face of time in blood.

489
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,950
Now, whatever PEBKAC error is behind these feelings,

490
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:49,280
I'm going to find it and rip it out of you.

491
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,450
Do I make myself clear?

492
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,570
Perfectly.

493
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,740
Program dismissed.

494
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,070
The creature also said, "I am fearless,

495
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,570
and therefore powerful."

496
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,820
-Well? -The user is indisposed.

497
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,530
Hold extraction until further directive.

498
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,950
-Indisposed? -Correct.

499
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,900
Define indisposed.

500
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,650
He's stuck in traffic.

501
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,240
No, he's at the opera.

502
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,070
He's standing on the top of Mount Fuji in a pair of green socks

503
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,150
playing "Pistol Packin' Mama" on the mandolin.

504
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,030
I gave you an order.

505
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,900
The creator's indisposed.

506
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,360
Hold extraction until we receive further directive.

507
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,400
Do I make myself clear?

508
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Yes, sir.

509
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,610
Programs dismissed.

510
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,030
Can I trust you?

511
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,030
It's a complicated question. How much time you got?

512
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,700
Sixty seconds. Answer now. Your life cycle depends upon it.

513
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,650
I don't have a life cycle.

514
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,450
Yes, you do. For another 54 seconds.

515
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,030
Can I trust you?

516
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,990
I'd like to think so, but probably not.

517
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,450
Where is Master Control?

518
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,740
Sir, Master Control is exhibiting signs of malfunction.

519
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,820
Any threat to the directive must be eliminated.

520
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,360
Extract the code and delete them both.

521
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,950
Do you understand?

522
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,070
-And Julian Dillinger? -You can't trust him.

523
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,240
For him, everyone and everything is expendable.

524
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,490
I miscalculated.

525
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,950
We have a new directive.

526
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,200
Athena, it doesn't have to be like this.

527
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,320
Delete him!

528
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,240
I'm okay. I'm okay.

529
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,860
They're headed towards the Transfer Portal.

530
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,400
We lost them in the Grid, ma'am.

531
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,740
Preparing the drones.

532
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,740
Delete Ares,

533
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,200
-and bring the user back to me. -Copy.

534
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,150
What happened back there?

535
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,070
I disobeyed my directive.

536
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,450
Which was?

537
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,700
To retrieve the code from your disk and delete the carrier.

538
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,900
Dillinger told you to delete me?

539
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
Hang on!

540
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,740
Where are they?

541
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,450
Scanning quadrants three and four.

542
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,030
Sector 18 clear.

543
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,740
Where are we going?

544
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,820
Transfer Portal. It's the only way out of the Grid.

545
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
You'll be reconstituted in the real world

546
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,450
exactly as you were before, hypothetically.

547
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,400
-Hypothetically? -Probably.

548
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,110
We have movement in sector 72.

549
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,030
Zeroing in on target.

550
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,530
Shut them down!

551
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,070
You wanna get home, I can help you.

552
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,610
But I need something in return.

553
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,240
I told you I don't have the code.

554
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,240
You found it once, you can find it again.

555
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,950
So you can give it to Dillinger?

556
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,200
Not for Dillinger.

557
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,860
For me.

558
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,030
Do we have a deal?

559
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,650
So, do we have a deal?

560
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,990
Yes. Yes, I know where to find the code. Just get me out of here.

561
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,200
Target approaching Transfer Portal in 45 seconds.

562
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:45,030
Drones malfunctioned and offline.

563
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,070
Attention.

564
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,780
Please stand clear.

565
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,110
Override not responding.

566
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,070
-What is it? -Who authorized this?

567
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,530
Sir, this originated inside the Grid.

568
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,610
Security protocol alert.

569
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,700
Julian?

570
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,740
All the agents report to transfer bay floor immediately.

571
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,280
Clear the area.

572
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,570
-Get everybody out of here. -Unauthorized printing in progress.

573
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,740
Clear the central area.

574
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,780
-Transfer complete. -Move in.

575
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,860
Well, well, well.

576
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,990
Just got double-crossed by my program.

577
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,280
It wants the Permanence Code for itself.

578
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,150
Eve, is that the deal?

579
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,110
It gets you out of the Grid, you turn Pinocchio into a real boy?

580
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,150
Well, you're missing the part where you were willing to commit murder

581
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,360
for a piece of software.

582
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,110
-Is that what it said? -Twenty-eight minutes, 41 seconds.

583
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,780
Ares!

584
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,490
I do hope this works out for you.

585
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,780
There's no second chances, no do-overs.

586
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,530
These are the last 29 minutes you'll ever have!

587
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,320
Better make it count!

588
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,530
I should've majored in English lit.

589
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,860
Transfer complete.

590
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,740
Your directive is to find Eve Kim,

591
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,400
return her to the Grid and get me the Permanence Code.

592
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,200
By any means necessary.

593
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,150
Do you understand your directive,

594
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,610
Master Control?

595
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,110
At your command, sir.

596
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:49,780
Attagirl.

597
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,030
Ticktock!

598
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,150
Now that is the coolest thing I have ever seen.

599
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,740
Do you know who Kevin Flynn was?

600
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,900
Of course. Visionary programmer, pioneer of The Digital Frontier.

601
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,700
Disappeared 1989.

602
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,280
I found the Permanence Code on a backup of Flynn's server.

603
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,610
That server is at Encom's office downtown. But we can make it within...

604
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,200
Twenty-six minutes, nine seconds.

605
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,280
Eve, your plan contains two major flaws.

606
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,400
Okay.

607
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:04,030
One, Encom is 9.2 miles away,

608
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,990
given our present speed and suboptimal choice of vehicle.

609
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,070
Oh, my God.

610
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,240
Two, we're gonna need a particle laser.

611
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,070
We need a phone.

612
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,990
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

613
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,860
Excuse me. Do you see this? This is me.

614
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:39,110
If you let me use your cell phone, my assistant will wire you $10,000.

615
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,450
I just need your phone.

616
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,700
Seth, where are you?

617
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,530
Eve, whose phone is this?

618
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:54,450
Listen to me. I need you at Encom in 15 minutes.

619
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,780
Hey, is everything okay?

620
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,700
Seth, bring the particle laser.

621
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,200
Encom, 15 minutes. Got it.

622
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,320
That's my car.

623
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,530
I'll wire you another 50K.

624
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,860
Hey, that's my car!

625
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:10,200
The Honda Civic 2.0 four-cylinder with 138 horsepower.

626
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,780
Classic.

627
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,360
Hey! That's my car!

628
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,150
That's my car!

629
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,490
God.

630
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,900
-Eve? -Yeah?

631
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,070
I was thinking about the time you told your sister

632
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:48,070
that you wished you never relaunched Space Paranoids.

633
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,400
Then you went on to say that...

634
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:51,610
Oh, my God. Of course. You read all my texts.

635
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,860
Yeah. Yeah, I've read them all. Every single one.

636
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:55,950
Wow.

637
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:57,990
Most of it was information of a personal nature.

638
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,360
Some of it, highly personal.

639
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:03,200
And I just can't get enough.

640
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,110
What?

641
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,950
Depeche Mode. Number eight on the UK singles chart, 1982.

642
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,570
I find their brand of pithy, catchy, timeless and true '80s electropop

643
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,570
to be deeply invigorating.

644
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,570
Sixteen minutes, 20 seconds.

645
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,570
Okay. So you like '80s pop and cyber-spying on me.

646
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,740
I was directed to kill you, Eve. Hacking seems pretty tame by comparison.

647
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,860
-Oh, my God. -For the record,

648
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,200
I don't think you have anything to be ashamed of.

649
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,990
Space Paranoids has entertained hundreds of millions.

650
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:48,700
Plus, it's a pretty cool game.

651
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:51,570
Anyway, you told your sister that designing games

652
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,570
left you feeling hollow, broken.

653
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,990
Was it that your work was about entertainment and profits

654
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,570
and her work was about improving the human condition?

655
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,650
Your texts suggest a certain fixation

656
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,740
with not being able to live up to her standards,

657
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,450
which must have been complicated,

658
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,860
especially considering she was the younger sister.

659
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,820
Okay. Watch it.

660
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,530
By the way, I don't think you should quit.

661
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,320
What do you mean?

662
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,570
Your plan upon returning from the mountains,

663
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,650
if I read you correctly,

664
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,360
was to hand over the Permanence Code to Encom

665
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,150
and then let them figure out what to do with it next, no?

666
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,780
Yeah. Now I understand.

667
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,360
You completed her work as a way to stay connected to her.

668
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,740
And now what?

669
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,110
Being human is hard.

670
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,950
The things that make life great are the same things

671
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:49,360
that make it excruciating, like love, loss.

672
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,200
You must miss her very much.

673
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,530
Hey, hey.

674
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:12,610
What the hell?

675
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:14,990
Check this guy out.

676
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,450
-Well, look who it is! -Hi.

677
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,860
Glad you could join us, Miss Kim. People have been wondering where you've been.

678
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,950
Long time no see. Bit of a rush, so I'm just gonna...

679
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:24,820
Eve, you gotta bring your badge.

680
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,200
Okay, yeah, Jolene...

681
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,280
Hello, Jolene. Hi. Got her badge right here.

682
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,490
Okay. His too?

683
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,320
No. He's not with us.

684
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,700
-Yes, he is. -Yes, he is.

685
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,200
Let's start literally anywhere you'd like.

686
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,740
This is my boyfriend, Ares.

687
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:50,070
No. Master Control Security Program from Dillinger's Grid.

688
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,240
Ares, Seth. Seth, Ares. Oh, God.

689
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,320
Pleasure.

690
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,400
Hey, that's nice.

691
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,530
So, Ares, like, as in, the god of war, Ares?

692
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
Yeah.

693
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,530
Cool. You're Greek. That's awesome.

694
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:05,030
So when you say that he's the security program, do you mean he's like...

695
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,530
-Yeah. He's not human. -He's not human.

696
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,110
Originated inside a GPU.

697
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,400
Okay. Is this for the Christmas video?

698
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,400
Three minutes to de-resolution.

699
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:16,650
Can you work with that, Seth?

700
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,740
Yeah.

701
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,280
Don't need help, guys.

702
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,360
Okay.

703
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,490
Oh, boy.

704
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:34,360
So, this is where I found the Permanence Code on a backup of this server.

705
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,990
Talk about first gen.

706
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:44,400
Talk about a piece of garbage. Am I right?

707
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:47,150
That was super insensitive to your ancestors, and I'm so sorry.

708
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,610
It's gonna take me a few minutes to set this up.

709
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,950
No rush. Two minutes, 18 seconds.

710
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,240
As soon as the laser's up, we'll send you into the Grid.

711
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,700
Once you're in there, you'll have to run your own search, but believe me,

712
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,740
-the Permanence Code is in there. -So what should I expect?

713
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,450
If I were to guess? Think '80s.

714
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:05,450
'80s.

715
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,280
I like the '80s.

716
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,610
One minute, 31 seconds.

717
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,110
Okay. Come on.

718
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,780
Please, help me.

719
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,900
Okay, all set.

720
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,070
Adapters.

721
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:22,150
Once you locate the code, get to the portal and we'll bring you out.

722
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:24,650
I'll activate it from the outside.

723
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:27,200
Can I trust you?

724
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,360
I'd like to think so,

725
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,780
-but probably not. -Probably not.

726
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,280
Yeah.

727
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,200
Well, it's a good thing we don't have trust issues

728
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,700
because if we did, I could imagine that--

729
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,780
I could pull the plug

730
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,860
and leave you in a Grid less complex than my smartphone

731
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,740
for all eternity.

732
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,530
The thought had crossed my mind.

733
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,150
Mine too.

734
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,240
Mine three.

735
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:50,950
Sorry. Just...

736
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:54,900
Well, here goes nothing.

737
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:56,950
Or here goes something.

738
01:10:58,570 --> 01:10:59,570
You're right.

739
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,200
I do miss her.

740
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,320
All the time.

741
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,860
Athena. She's here.

742
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:17,990
What is that?

743
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:19,820
Athena.

744
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,900
Wait. Who?

745
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:23,280
Seth, the laser. The laser!

746
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,280
Okay, initiating systems now.

747
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,860
Connecting to the Flynn Grid.

748
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:34,240
Firing up the laser.

749
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,110
Wait, what's she doing?

750
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,820
She's waiting for me to time out

751
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,570
and then she'll come for you.

752
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,740
We're almost there. Get ready.

753
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,950
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

754
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:51,400
Ares, move in front of the laser.

755
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,240
Okay. We're ready.

756
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:57,280
What are you doing?

757
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
Come on.

758
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,610
Change of plans.

759
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,950
-No, no, no! -No, no, no!

760
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,740
Well, that actually worked.

761
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,780
-He's inside. -Great.

762
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
Move!

763
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,490
Eve.

764
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,320
Time to get back to the Grid.

765
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,650
Leave her alone!

766
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:52,450
You're very persistent, user.

767
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:56,950
What?

768
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,610
Hi.

769
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,110
Did we win?

770
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,490
She'll be back.

771
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,070
Ares.

772
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,650
He can't get out.

773
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,530
The '80s.

774
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,700
Binary digit.

775
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,450
-You're a Bit. -Yes.

776
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,280
I'm looking for something. Can you help me find it?

777
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,860
Yes, yes, yes.

778
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,950
Classic.

779
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,070
I'm surrounded by the wide-scale destruction

780
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:49,070
caused by tonight's brazen attack that left local residents stunned.

781
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,150
Now, there is speculation that Dillinger Systems

782
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,990
had something to do with the event,

783
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,030
but authorities have remained tight-lipped.

784
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,320
Citizens and authorities alike want to know...

785
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,150
was this a coordinated attack or technology run amok?

786
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,570
What now?

787
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,570
What is this?

788
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,780
Where's my code?

789
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,280
Hey!

790
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,400
What are you doing? Who gave you this directive?

791
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,570
You did, sir.

792
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,070
What is this?

793
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,070
Warning.

794
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:43,320
No, no, no. This is too big, Athena. Too big!

795
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,650
Julian!

796
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,950
You're done.

797
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:49,280
The board is moving as we speak to strip you of your title,

798
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,530
and I'm reassuming control of the company.

799
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:53,780
No, you can't do that. Can't do that!

800
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,490
Yes, I can.

801
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,360
This is not going any further.

802
01:18:58,740 --> 01:18:59,570
You can't...

803
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,490
My first order of business

804
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,110
-is shutting down The Permanence Project. -No, no, no. Mom, no!

805
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,990
Don't be afraid.

806
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,200
We gave a thousand lives for the Grid.

807
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:20,650
You only have to give one.

808
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:23,200
No, no, no.

809
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,900
Mom!

810
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,490
Impediment eliminated.

811
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,240
What did you do? What did you do?

812
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,740
I am fulfilling my directive.

813
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,070
Capture Eve Kim. Return her to the Grid by any means necessary.

814
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,110
Scanning for further impediments.

815
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,240
Please keep clear.

816
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,740
Hang on, Mom. Hang on.

817
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,820
No!

818
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,110
Flynn.

819
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,780
Greetings, program.

820
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:52,780
Oh, God. Not good.

821
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:56,490
There are multiple reports of fire and destruction on the upper levels...

822
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:57,570
Eve?

823
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,570
What the hell happened to our office?

824
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,030
Ajay, look, there's no time.

825
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:03,150
The Dillingers transported me inside their server

826
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,820
by reversing the direction of a particle laser.

827
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,240
-Not this one. Theirs. -That's impossible.

828
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,150
No. A scary lady did it, man. She threw me... It was wild.

829
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:12,950
I saw a complex world

830
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:15,240
where packets of energy move as vehicles

831
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,400
that trail by lines of light.

832
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:20,280
And programs take on human form.

833
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:24,110
I met the most advanced AI known to mankind.

834
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:25,650
His name is Ares.

835
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,740
Like the god of war, but he's actually a super nice guy.

836
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:28,950
-Sorry. Go ahead. -Right now,

837
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:31,490
Ares is inside Flynn's original server.

838
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:33,200
He's looking for the Permanence Code.

839
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,650
I have to bring him back here, and I'm not going to be able to do that

840
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,490
until we fix this laser.

841
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:42,110
I don't understand. Are you alive?

842
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,700
I exist in this moment because you do.

843
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,700
A reflection of your presence.

844
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,900
What's your story?

845
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:56,610
I'm Ares, Master Control of the Dillinger Security Grid.

846
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,490
Dillinger?

847
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,320
Well, we both know you can't get here from there.

848
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,990
Been someplace else in between?

849
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:11,700
What did you make of it out there?

850
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,110
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

851
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,110
You can say that again.

852
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,610
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

853
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,990
Classic. Humor, man.

854
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,610
What are you looking for?

855
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,650
Permanence.

856
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,030
The Permanence Code, to be exact.

857
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,570
Strange things have been happening.

858
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:42,360
I questioned my directive. I disobeyed my directive.

859
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,570
A malfunctioning program who wants to live.

860
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:49,070
Really?

861
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,490
What makes you think I should help you?

862
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:54,320
No, it's not about me.

863
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,900
Not anymore.

864
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,400
I have a friend in danger, and she needs my help.

865
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,280
Fascinating.

866
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:08,950
Fascinating.

867
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,740
-Ajay, can you send the prompt, please? -Sure, yeah.

868
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,990
-Hey, Eve. -Not now, Seth.

869
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,320
Okay. Hey, are you sure?

870
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,110
Because that looks like an actual Recognizer flying towards us.

871
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,240
What in God's name is that?

872
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,280
It's Athena.

873
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,110
She's back.

874
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,240
As long as the Dillinger Network is online, she'll keep coming.

875
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,490
If she gets me, she gets the Permanence Code.

876
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:49,400
The laser. Athena's laser!

877
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,820
The Dillingers run a wireless direct link protocol,

878
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,950
so let's use what's left of the laser to ping the network and trace a path home.

879
01:24:57,030 --> 01:25:00,450
Once you have a connection, then you can nuke the whole Dillinger Grid.

880
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:03,240
And that's the only way to stop her for good.

881
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,990
Eve, what are you talking about? She's right there.

882
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:11,780
-I gotta go. -Wait, what?

883
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,780
I'll keep her away for as long as I can.

884
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,860
-What? -I'm gonna buy you some time.

885
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,700
-Eve... -You guys got this.

886
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:42,820
You're right. I think there is something wrong with me.

887
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,490
Or maybe there's something right with you.

888
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,820
Well, maybe you're just learning.

889
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,860
That's what we all ought to be doing.

890
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:55,490
Back in the day, when tech was young,

891
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:58,820
I'd think, "Damn, we're moving fast."

892
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:03,950
You move fast, you leave stuff behind.

893
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,820
How many people born in this century have even heard of Mozart?

894
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,860
I like Mozart.

895
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,240
Oh?

896
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:19,700
That said, if I'm being honest, I prefer Depeche Mode.

897
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,530
Really? Why is that?

898
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,700
I know one is considered the greatest composer

899
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,650
in the history of Western civilization,

900
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:31,070
the other a synth pop band from the '80s,

901
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:35,990
but I find their balance of technological exploration and pop hooks

902
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:37,450
combined with...

903
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:42,070
combined with...

904
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,860
What's wrong?

905
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:48,280
I can't put my love of Depeche Mode into words.

906
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,200
It's just a...

907
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,740
A what?

908
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,900
A feeling.

909
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,820
Very good.

910
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,650
Very good, man.

911
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,650
An airship the size of a skyscraper has just crossed into the city's airspace

912
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,450
and is headed for the downtown area...

913
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,240
You...

914
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,450
You did this.

915
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:37,360
And tonight, as military...

916
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,530
Impressive. Fully segmented zero trust architecture.

917
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:44,030
Built to be totally impregnable to vertical, lateral or hybrid attacks.

918
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,570
-Damn it. Can't get a connection, dude. -No luck here either.

919
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,400
Please evacuate the area.

920
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:24,450
-What is that thing? Bring in SWAT! -Requesting backup.

921
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,110
Oh, my God.

922
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,360
Oh, my God!

923
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,240
Come on. A little closer.

924
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,570
Viper-1 to Base. Tally on hostile.

925
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,360
Confirm visual ID.

926
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,110
Engaging. Fox-2 Missile away.

927
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,610
Splash negative. Missile intercepted.

928
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:31,280
Be advised, enemy fighter escorts inbound and moving fast.

929
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,570
Copy, Raven-1. Assess and report threat posture.

930
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,700
Viper-1, tally multiple bandits.

931
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,570
Hostile intent confirmed.

932
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,650
Mayday. Mayday. I'm hit.

933
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,110
Viper-1. Punching out.

934
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:16,400
Guys? Guys.

935
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:18,400
Oh, my God. There's hundreds of 'em.

936
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,900
They're going after Eve.

937
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,320
If we can't access the Dillinger server, there's gonna be nothing left to save.

938
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,030
Base, this is Raven-1. Enemy aircraft engaging.

939
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,320
I'm defensive.

940
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:15,200
Multiple bandits. Redirected to primary target.

941
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,070
I'm hit. Punching out.

942
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:11,110
Ready?

943
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:15,860
Hope you are, man, 'cause there's no going back.

944
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,610
Permanence.

945
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,150
Funny.

946
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,900
When I found it, that's what I called it.

947
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,240
I know better now.

948
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:36,740
Ought to be called the Impermanence Code.

949
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:57,150
The back door to my old lab.

950
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,990
One go-around.

951
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,860
That's all you've got.

952
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,200
One...

953
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,700
is all I want.

954
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,780
Love that!

955
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:20,650
You keep surprising me!

956
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:27,110
We'll do this from the ground then.

957
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,150
...and there are reports that a civilian may be onboard,

958
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,740
making this a possible hostage scenario.

959
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:37,320
Athena. She must've gotten Eve.

960
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,490
...into the mountains.

961
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:41,570
Hey, hey, hey!

962
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,820
Soon we'll be back on the Grid.

963
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:59,070
General, thank you for taking the time to speak with us tonight.

964
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:00,900
Hey, Erin. Seth.

965
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,780
Stop the clock.

966
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,200
No way. You're in?

967
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,570
There's a reason why I have the corner office, my man.

968
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,280
Hey.

969
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,570
You came back.

970
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:25,650
How did you...

971
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,860
Let's just say I had a little help from a friend.

972
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,780
Wait, the Dillinger Grid...

973
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,570
Ajay and Seth, they...

974
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,110
-Go. -No.

975
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,860
Ares!

976
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,570
What have you done?

977
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,360
You're out of time, Athena.

978
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,070
And you're out of lives.

979
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:05,070
I'll kill you and come back for her.

980
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,990
It's you she wants.

981
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:20,990
If she gets the code, she can't be stopped.

982
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,030
You had everything.

983
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:25,530
-Go. -No.

984
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:29,400
The most advanced, the most powerful, and you gave it away.

985
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,450
For her?

986
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,740
Go!

987
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,820
This is the end for you.

988
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,900
Payload ready for transfer.

989
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:25,030
Shipping it.

990
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:28,110
Let's hope Eve was right.

991
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,150
Alert. Unknown file incoming.

992
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,650
In pursuit of this life for yourself,

993
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:47,400
did you once consider what that meant for the Grid?

994
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:38,950
We were given an order. It is our purpose.

995
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:02,490
It's not our purpose.

996
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:04,780
It's our programming.

997
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,950
Our purpose is yet to be determined.

998
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,110
It's over.

999
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,570
And there's no coming back.

1000
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:42,570
No.

1001
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,110
Not this time.

1002
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:54,860
They did it.

1003
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,570
Oh, my...

1004
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,610
I followed my directive.

1005
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,200
I know.

1006
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,610
And now...

1007
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,070
what is yours?

1008
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,400
I'm not sure.

1009
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:25,030
I guess we'll see.

1010
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:50,490
Dillinger Systems is under intense scrutiny tonight

1011
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:53,320
as speculation grows around its potential involvement

1012
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,740
in the series of devastating attacks that have rocked the city.

1013
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:59,650
Federal authorities have confirmed an active investigation

1014
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,530
into the company's recent activity,

1015
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:05,030
and many are pointing directly at CEO Julian Dillinger.

1016
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:08,780
Agents have been deployed to question the CEO as well as his mother,

1017
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:10,490
and to locate board members

1018
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,900
who will be questioned on their knowledge of the situation.

1019
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:15,650
Meanwhile, the city remains in disarray.

1020
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,030
Emergency services are overwhelmed,

1021
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:21,400
while entire neighborhoods are dealing with the wide-scale destruction.

1022
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:40,610
Julian Dillinger, this is the police. We have you surrounded.

1023
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,820
Open the door and come out with your hands up.

1024
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:51,780
Come on.

1025
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:00,860
Breach!

1026
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:03,780
Police!

1027
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:07,280
Stay where you are!

1028
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:15,070
Maintain visuals on all exits.

1029
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:18,360
Charlie-9, we're at last field location. Last field location.

1030
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:21,110
Yellow-6, out front. Let's move. Let's move.

1031
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:31,200
Are you good?

1032
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,570
I think I broke a rib.

1033
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:40,950
You still gonna quit your job?

1034
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:46,400
No, I'm not gonna quit anything.

1035
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:47,650
Good.

1036
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,240
Good.

1037
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:51,320
I have some ideas.

1038
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,150
-Oh, yeah? Nice. -Yeah.

1039
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,280
Well, the world needs you, Eve.

1040
01:44:58,110 --> 01:44:59,700
The Grid needs you.

1041
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,280
Yeah. It's funny, permanence.

1042
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:09,490
A wise man once told me it should have been called the "Impermanence Code."

1043
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,360
I guess that's the thing about life.

1044
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:15,860
There's nothing quite permanent about it.

1045
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:20,400
No.

1046
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:22,490
No, there isn't.

1047
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,280
Yeah.

1048
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:38,990
So where are you gonna go?

1049
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:41,990
I have some ideas.

1050
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:18,490
Under the continued leadership of CEO Eve Kim, Encom is transforming industries

1051
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:22,320
and shaping lives in ways once thought impossible.

1052
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,150
Thanks to the discovery of the Permanence Code,

1053
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:27,860
the company has made revolutionary advances

1054
01:46:27,950 --> 01:46:30,700
growing crops in climate-vulnerable regions,

1055
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,650
developing drugs for treatment-resistant cancers,

1056
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:37,070
and accelerating the development of alternative fuels.

1057
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:41,320
Encom is committed to exploring new digital frontiers,

1058
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:45,360
driving progress at the intersection of technology and life itself

1059
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:47,780
to improve the human condition.

1060
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:51,950
In fact, innovation has always been at the heart of Encom.

1061
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:56,820
In the 1980s, visionary Kevin Flynn imagined a future beyond gaming,

1062
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:00,280
a bold leap into new digital frontiers.

1063
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,610
Today, that vision is a reality.

1064
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,150
I almost forgot.

1065
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:11,570
-Postcard? Who sends a postcard? -Don't know.

1066
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:12,950
Didn't read it.

1067
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:18,950
Dear Eve,

1068
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,200
since I last saw you,

1069
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,950
I've been living what they call "off-grid."

1070
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:27,030
Pun intended.

1071
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:31,400
In my travels, I've seen incredible things.

1072
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:37,110
Despite its wonder and beauty, I've come to realize that life is…

1073
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:39,950
Well, it's hard to put in a nutshell.

1074
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,450
Some days, I find myself wondering where we'll be a hundred years from now

1075
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:48,200
and how others like me might fit into that future.

1076
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:53,990
I feel like I might not be alone with these questions.

1077
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:58,490
For now, I don't think the world is quite ready to meet me,

1078
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:01,780
but I am meeting the world.

1079
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:06,070
And so,when that introduction finally comes,

1080
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,320
as a good friend of mine once said,

1081
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:14,150
"Maybe what emerges from the unknown won't be so scary after all."

1082
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,030
Until we meet again,

1083
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:22,150
your friend, Ares.

1084
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:45,280
Sark…
