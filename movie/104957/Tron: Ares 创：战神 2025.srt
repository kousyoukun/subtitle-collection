As long as the Dillinger

she'll keep coming.

If she gets me,

The laser. Athena's laser!

The Dillingers run a wireless
direct link protocol,

1223
01:24:57,806 --> 01:24:59,349
so let's use
what's left of the laser

1224
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,934
to ping the network
and trace a path home.

86
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,669
對啊，她堅信費林留了答案給我們

87
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,963
留在磁片上？

88
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:10,965
可惜費林當時沒有雲端

89
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,677
你在這裡的時候還要當執行長嗎？

90
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:17,805
開財報電話會議，發表《恐慌城市》

91
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,515
把這搞定吧

92
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:22,728
我能在這裡做早餐墨西哥捲，好耶

93
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,941
這是為了你，黛絲

94
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,080
（載入磁片中，請稍候）

95
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,750
各位董事會成員

96
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,004
卌多年來，我在狄林傑系統的夥伴

97
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,881
一直與英克爾爭奪未來的控制權

98
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,636
你們讓我主導公司，確保勝利

99
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,221
今天

100
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,015
我做到了

101
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,934
想像我們的數位實力不限於數位領域

102
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:06,604
要是我們對機器的夢想

103
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,398
都能在這裡實現呢？

104
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,359
要是能為兩個原本分隔的世界

105
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,529
搭起橋梁呢？

106
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,865
如今的科技大企業大談人工智慧

107
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,492
虛擬世界會是什麼樣？

108
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,744
我們何時能抵達？

109
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,831
各位，我們不會去那裡

110
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:28,127
而是它們會過來

111
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,258
註意，請立刻戴上安全眼鏡

112
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,511
雷射系統啟動，電力波動正常

113
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,180
（雷射校正中）

114
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,182
警告，勿靠近

115
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,848
輸出來自…

116
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:43,849
（轉移開始）

117
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,226
狄林傑系統伺服器

118
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,271
原始資料流入已開始

119
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,544
倒數十、九

120
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,962
八、七

121
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,048
六、五

122
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,594
四、三、二、一

123
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,263
轉移完成

124
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,390
容我介紹

125
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,144
狄林傑系統兩棲快速反應坦克

126
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,355
達爾特

127
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,023
在伺服器中進行數位建模

128
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,026
利用我們的專利雷射科技輸出

129
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:36,902
配有M一步槍，兩把M二四零機關槍

130
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,988
最高時速一百廿公里

131
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,076
至於耐用性，找一面牆，它會穿牆而過

132
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,830
這是全面性戰爭，反應時間五分鐘

133
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:52,586
所以，如果能創造未來的硬體

134
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:55,756
何不創造士兵來操作它？

135
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,448
各位先生女士，為你隆重介紹戰神

136
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:26,369
這是史上最精密的安全程式

137
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,165
想和他握手？請便，他不會咬人

138
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,792
戰神有數十億行專屬程式碼

139
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,877
它是活的嗎？

140
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,633
那得看你的定義，史都華

141
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,595
跟你不同，他十分強壯

142
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,223
快如閃電，極具智慧

143
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,519
他全是自有技術，而且隨時能犧牲

144
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,439
戰神是終極士兵

145
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,317
不需要食物飲水，不會流血

146
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,153
如果出現奇蹟，他在戰場上倒下

147
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,947
我就再做一個給你

148
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,995
（聲震波）

149
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,626
程式碼那麼精密

150
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,504
你怎麼控制得了它？

151
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,464
我向你擔保，將軍

152
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,299
最先進的失效安全機制

153
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,967
與限制協定都已就位

154
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,972
戰神可測可控，完全服從

155
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,892
伴隨等熵擡昇的南方鋒面，轉為氣旋

156
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:34,438
預計降雨六十六毫米

157
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,609
希望你們帶了傘

158
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,737
我必須恭喜你，朱利安

159
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,946
你承諾會大獲全勝

160
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:46,492
這比我們想像中更了不起

161
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,452
謝謝

162
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,454
我祖父創立狄林傑公司時

163
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,166
根本沒人聽過「網路安全」

164
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,503
軍事人工智慧是未來趨勢

165
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,132
問題不在是否該製造汽車，汽車…

166
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,509
正在製造中

167
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,262
問題是…

168
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,890
誰握有鑰匙？

169
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,135
好炫的小把戲

170
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,555
時間？ -卌四秒

171
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,141
「希望你們帶了傘」

172
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,437
那在劇本裡，還是他即興演出？

173
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,689
伊莉莎白狄林傑

174
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,608
已故創辦人愛德華狄林傑的長女

175
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,071
在公司歷史上平淡無奇的時期

176
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,324
長期擔任執行長，隨後被獨子取代

177
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,284
幸會

178
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,286
平淡無奇？

179
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,248
我任期的市佔率提昇百分之十二，幾乎…

180
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,002
總之我們不說「取代」，我們…

181
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,130
稱為「生孩子」

182
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,132
當然

183
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,178
很榮幸見到我創造者的創造者

184
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,763
又來了

185
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,565
我發現你沒有提到

186
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,110
你似乎無法讓這傢夥活著

187
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,321
超過廿五分鐘 -廿九分鐘

188
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,200
朱利安，欺騙投資人不算商業模式

189
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,411
掌控恆久程式碼的人就能掌握未來

190
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,913
我們非贏不可

191
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,131
聽著，我…

192
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,137
欣賞你的遠見，站挺

193
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,184
不過董事會衹會再支持你半年

194
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,645
如果你運氣好的話

195
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,398
要是不成功

196
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,653
這一切都會化為烏有，寶貝

197
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,410
我們過去卌年來打造的所有心血

198
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,290
要是我說我找到方法了呢？

199
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,354
（凱文費林，伺服器備份）

200
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,153
這是我第九十五個早餐墨西哥捲

201
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,158
眞的吃不膩，很扯吧？

202
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,704
好吧…

203
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,502
還好家裡不是衹有黛絲執迷不悟

204
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,088
賽斯，你說得對

205
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,342
抱歉，我該更關註你…沒關係

206
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,095
（輸入檔名）

207
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,055
好

208
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,856
對不起啦 -少來

209
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,651
在氣溫零下的地方待三個月很久，我懂

210
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,030
又四天十小時卅二分

211
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,325
誰在算呢？

212
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,787
等一下

213
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,124
什麼意思？

214
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,209
什麼事？

215
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,669
（列印？檢查完成？）

216
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,348
（恭喜）

217
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,102
賽斯

218
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,232
發現什麼了嗎？ -應該是

219
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,651
那行程式碼

220
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,820
那就是他的藏法，有兩行

221
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,994
好像雙螺旋

222
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,914
它就是雙螺旋

223
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,791
黛絲一定會很開心

224
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,503
你認眞？不會再「廿九分鐘掛點」？

225
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,713
如果跟我想的一樣

226
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,300
它就是恆久程式碼

227
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,305
（錄影中）

228
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,224
好

229
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,269
英克爾離線測試三一七a-一

230
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,770
執行恆久程式碼

231
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,357
測試資產穩定性能否突破目前廿九分的限制

232
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,401
開始

233
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,499
準備好就開始 -好

234
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,044
（轉移開始）

235
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,892
關鍵就在技巧

236
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,332
百看不厭

237
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,087
測試開始，廿九分倒數計時

238
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,229
看這次能不能撐下去

239
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,610
戰神是終極士兵

240
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,155
如果出現奇蹟，他在戰場上倒下

241
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,990
我就再做一個給你

242
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,702
全是自有技術，而且隨時…

243
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,455
能犧牲

244
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,834
雅典娜 -歡迎回來，長官

245
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,130
各單位已上線，可供檢查

246
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,341
行程順利嗎？

247
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,343
很有趣，這次不一樣

248
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,014
我見到一對母子

249
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,474
當時在下雨

250
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:11,312
大氣中凝結的水份，以水滴狀落下的現象

251
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,730
我幾乎能感受到

252
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,319
感受？我不懂

253
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,617
（歡迎瘋空粉）

254
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,621
我是伊芙，冷靜下來，傳訊息

255
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,085
伊芙，我是艾琳，亞傑找你，請回電

256
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,463
還是轉語音信箱

257
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,090
財星五百大企業執行長

258
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,383
手機卻在最重要的夜晚關機？

259
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,885
可惡，伊芙，你在哪？

260
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,972
瘋空博覽會

261
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:55,397
五、四、三、二、一

262
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,706
我們成功了嗎？它還在

263
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,458
我們改變世界了

264
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,254
你成功了，伊芙，天啊，成功了

265
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,006
英克爾今晚傳出重大消息

266
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,885
執行長伊芙金不克參加該公司備受矚目的

267
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,889
新遊戲《瘋狂空間：恐慌城市》發表會

268
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,516
金極具設計遠見

269
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,519
是該暢銷系列的幕後推手…

270
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,604
我跟幾個董事會成員談過

271
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,732
他們當然大為驚豔

272
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,567
朱利安

273
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,320
繼續 -是

274
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,532
你在幹嘛？ -媽，我想改變世界

275
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,035
怎麼回事？

276
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,620
你駭進英克爾？

277
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,790
衹是瞄一眼，沒人會註意

278
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,126
你怎麼會認為英克爾快找到了？

279
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,503
因為我知道還有誰在找它

280
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,630
誰？

281
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,090
伊芙金

282
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,051
她追隨她妹的腳步

283
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,344
她想找恆久程式碼，我感覺得到

284
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,430
我要找到她，到時候…

285
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,766
我覺得不妥，太冒險了，朱利安

286
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,899
糟糕

287
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,995
（英克爾伺服器農場）

288
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,940
（安全漏洞）

289
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,115
各區出現安全漏洞

290
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,996
程式們，我們的指令很清楚

291
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,456
滲透伺服器核心

292
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,209
擷取伊芙金的使用者檔案

293
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,255
直播倒數五、四、三…

294
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,885
瘋狂空間粉絲，準備好了嗎？

295
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:18,474
掌聲歡迎英克爾科技長，亞傑辛

296
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,602
牛仔上場 -不

297
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,149
大家好

298
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,234
你們好

299
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,403
謝謝

300
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,157
你好嗎，瘋空博覽會？

301
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,141
我要進去了

302
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,871
（獲準進入英克爾）

303
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,913
我進去了

304
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,666
我是天才，誰曉得你養了一個天才？

305
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,335
我進去了

306
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,920
惹禍上身

307
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,427
（山姆費林的神秘女郎是誰？）

308
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,017
啟動封鎖程序，切斷網絡存取

309
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,602
我們得立刻應對

310
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,898
啟動安全程序

311
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:53,778
人們將生活託付給人工智慧

312
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,488
你感到安心嗎？

313
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,781
聽著

314
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,200
每個末日情境

315
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,620
都有醫療突破和科學發現

316
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:07,417
或許未知帶來的事物沒那麼可怕

317
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:11,088
如果它的重大缺陷衹是仁慈呢？

318
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,425
這是什麼？他在幹嘛？

319
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:19,220
不過，你偏好跟眞人對話嗎？

320
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:24,060
當然，但要是那個人已經聯絡不上了呢？

321
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,145
不在人世了呢？

322
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,363
拿到檔案了

323
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,656
（檔案已下載）

324
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,658
恭喜

325
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,661
趁機快離開吧

326
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:55,466
程式們，開戰

327
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,572
對！

328
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,740
感謝大家

329
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,950
瘋空粉都怎麼做？

330
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,079
徹底碾壓你

331
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,346
凱厄斯

332
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,353
他失能了，別管他

333
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,907
你撐得住，凱厄斯

334
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,244
有時得犧牲騎士才能逮到對方的皇后

335
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,079
（確認清除資料？）

336
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,830
（有效負載已部署）

337
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,731
對全世界首發最新版的

338
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:39,194
《瘋狂空間：恐慌城市》

339
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,403
怎麼了？ -那是什麼？

340
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,572
太扯了 -你看到了嗎？

341
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,615
辛先生，你得跟我來

342
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,159
這是技術問題

343
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,368
馬上回來 -這邊請

344
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,744
全都掛了

345
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,456
很好，主控

346
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,584
已取得伊芙金的檔案

347
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,295
目標達成

348
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:06,138
長官，我想知道凱厄斯程式為何沒重建

349
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,352
我想知道你為何想知道

350
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,856
凱厄斯失能，所以被刪除了

351
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:24,990
跟任何不照指令運作的程式一樣

352
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,326
你懂嗎？

353
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,002
回答我，主控

354
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,794
當然

355
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,549
我們是隨時可以犧牲的

356
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,845
新任務，主控，找到伊芙金

357
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,930
是

358
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,351
我們好像碰上小型網路攻擊，小朱

359
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,519
但你當然知道了

360
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,271
看來全世界都知道

361
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,772
最好遠離社群媒體幾天

362
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,857
你想跟我玩？那就來玩

363
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,443
我聽說你向董事會提的案子了

364
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,987
但你漏了一個關鍵細節

365
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,075
你有說進攻時間衹有廿九分鐘嗎？

366
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,368
別逼我向報社爆料

367
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,994
你的承諾無法實現

368
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,204
承諾？

369
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,332
就像你們說執行長會在辦公室坐鎮嗎？

370
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,209
事有蹊蹺吧，亞傑？

371
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,711
先是山姆費林，現在是他的繼位者

372
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,631
她在哪，亞傑？你知道嗎？

373
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,965
也許你說得對

374
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,467
也許伊芙瘋了

375
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,721
也許她擅離職守出國，也許…

376
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,225
她躱起來，跟你找同樣的東西

377
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,685
我知道我會賭誰贏

378
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,562
如果你今晚過後還有錢

379
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,855
通話結束

380
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,318
我討厭那個人

381
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:47,988
非常謝謝你

382
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,409
那些柳橙是我做的，說來話長

383
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,414
停…

384
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,748
你在幹嘛？

385
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,501
一千九百一十三則訊息，好紅喔 -哇

386
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,627
（亞傑辛）

387
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,130
是亞傑，找你的

388
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,592
亞傑，你在那裡嗎？ -我在嗎？

389
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,552
我們的伺服器被暴力破解

390
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,096
就在重大產品發表會上

391
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:14,390
我們建立的一切都垮了，你得馬上回來

392
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,893
我找到了，亞傑，是眞的

393
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:20,813
就在黛絲認定的地方，一直都在費林手上

394
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,190
你是說恆久程式碼？

395
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,525
對，已經超過四小時了

396
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,903
沒有退化，沒有不穩，狀態極佳

397
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,073
等下，你說四小時？

398
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,784
對，四小時 -天啊

399
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,037
他一定知道，伊芙

400
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,372
我跟剛狄林傑談過

401
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,957
等下，你跟狄林傑談過？

402
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,917
他在找程式碼，他認為你也是

403
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,544
我們得趕緊行動

404
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,005
伊芙，你表現得太好了

405
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,507
是黛絲的功勞

406
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,841
我正要去英克爾

407
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,303
我們會保住程式碼，我存在隨身碟裡

408
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,265
（存取資料庫中）

409
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,144
我們要重新推出《瘋狂空間》

410
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,895
今天你生日…

411
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,274
亞傑 -今天你生日

412
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,777
（伊芙金）

413
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,406
你好嗎，伊芙？有消息要告訴粉絲嗎？

414
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,490

記者現在就在市區

518
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:45,030
（市區飛車追逐，傷亡慘重）

你怎麼能這麼魯莽？

520
00:47:47,158 --> 00:47:50,201
等世人看見我創造的成果

521

就會諒解一切

522
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:54,456
你是這麼想的？

523
00:47:55,791 --> 00:48:00,379
你認為你掌控了局面？

524
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:02,797
並沒有

525
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,924
相信我們能改變世界

526
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,717
是這家公司存續的關鍵

527
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:10,347
卻也能讓公司毀於一旦

528
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:16,187
你的職責是明白其中的差別

529

我在哪裡？

540
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,733
狄林傑系統中央處理器

541
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,069
等下，什麼？

542
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:52,283
我們已經確認序列

543
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:55,201
使用者擁有程式碼

544
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:56,203
程式碼？

545
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:01,374
程式碼？我沒有程式碼，我摧毀隨身碟了

546
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,958
使用者，安靜

547
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:06,004
程式碼不衹在隨身碟裡，也在你體內

548
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:09,715
不管是否記得，你看過它，那就夠了

549
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,384
但… -她的光碟不穩定

550
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:12,968
說明何謂不穩定

551
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:16,597
擷取程式碼可能導致載體消解

552
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:18,016
指令很清楚

553
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:21,894
隔離程式碼，進行擷取

554
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:22,729
収到

555
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:26,524
等下，不…

556
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:27,609
停

557
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:30,571
雅典娜說得對

558
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:34,033
我們衹遵從一名使用者的指令

559
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:38,869
（戰神，來訊）

560
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,497
（載入訊息中）

561
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,750
（擷取伊芙金的恆久程式碼）

562
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,587
（可能造成載體消解）

563
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:54,053
如果使用者消解，會剩下什麼？

564
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,137
什麼也不剩

565
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:58,389
她在創界網絡不會留下蹤跡？

566
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,434
不會，長官

567
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:15,241
擷取程式碼，刪除載體

568
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,619
可是，擷取恆久程式碼

569
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,999
會將載體從創界網絡和您的世界刪除

570
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:27,085
（執行這項命令）

571
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:29,130
（將無法復原）

572
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:36,011
很久以前，有一種武器叫戰神

573
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:38,888
戰神對朱利安狄林傑言聽計從

574
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:41,557
朱利安狄林傑賺進一兆元

575
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:45,562
還用鮮血讓他在歷史上留名

576
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:48,939
無論這些感受來自什麼操作錯誤

577
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,277
我都會找到它，把它從你身上剔除

578
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:54,363
我說得清楚嗎？

579
00:51:56,032 --> 00:51:57,573
十分清楚

580
00:51:57,574 --> 00:51:59,660
程式退下

581
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:07,001
那個怪物也說：「我無所畏懼

582
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:10,504
因而強大」

583
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,850
如何？ -使用者身體不適

584
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,561
靜候指令再擷取

585
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:27,978
身體不適？ -是的

586
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,856
說明何謂身體不適

587
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,611
他困在車陣中

588
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,199
不，他在歌劇院

589
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:42,118
他穿著綠色襪子站在富士山頂

590
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,204
用曼陀林演奏《帶手槍的媽媽》

591
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,081
我已經下達命令

592
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:47,957
創造者身體不適

593
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:51,419
等我們収到進一步指令再擷取

594
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,380
我說得清楚嗎？

595
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:56,342
清楚，長官

596
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,594
程式們退下

597
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,108
我能信任你嗎？

598
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:16,111
這問題很複雜，你有多少時間？

599
00:53:16,112 --> 00:53:18,779
六十秒，快回答，你的生命週期就靠它了

600
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,740
我沒有生命週期

601
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:23,534
你有，還剩下五十四秒

602
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:25,037
我可以信任你嗎？

603
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:29,040
我希望可以，但應該不行

604
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,210
（雅典娜，來訊）

605
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:40,551
主控在哪裡？

606
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:43,764
長官，主控出現故障跡象

607
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:54,940
指令受到的威脅都必須剷除

608
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:58,486
擷取程式碼，把他們兩個都刪除

609
00:53:58,487 --> 00:53:59,988
你懂嗎？

610
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,202
朱利安狄林傑呢？ -不能信任他

611
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:10,291
他認為所有人事物都可以犧牲

612
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,627
我失算了

613
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:16,005
我們有新指令

614
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:20,259
雅典娜，沒必要這樣

615
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:25,389
刪除他

616
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,417
我沒事…

617
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:21,047
他們要前往轉移入口

618
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,590
他們躱進創界網絡了

619
00:56:25,676 --> 00:56:26,927
準備無人機

620
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:37,020
刪除戰神

621
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:39,439
帶使用者回來 -収到

622
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,191
（無人機儲備庫）

623
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,460
剛才發生什麼事？

624
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:02,378
我違抗指令

625
00:57:02,379 --> 00:57:03,754
什麼指令？

626
00:57:03,755 --> 00:57:06,925
從你的光碟取回程式碼，刪除載體

627
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:11,138
狄林傑叫你刪除我？

628
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,561
抓緊

629
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:22,065
他們在哪裡？

630
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:23,774
掃描第三與第四象限

631
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:25,277
十八區沒有發現

632
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:30,073
我們要去哪？

633
00:57:30,074 --> 00:57:33,159
轉移入口，離開創界網絡的唯一途徑

634
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,245
你會在眞實世界重建

635
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:37,706
理論上會跟以前完全一樣

636
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:42,669
理論上？ -應該吧

637
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,381
七十二區有動靜

638
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:47,299
瞄準目標

639
00:57:48,342 --> 00:57:49,801
射擊他們

640
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,355
你想回家，我能幫你

641
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:03,899
但我需要一點回報

642
00:58:04,733 --> 00:58:06,527
我說過我沒有程式碼

643
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:10,613
你找到它一次，就能再找到第二次

644
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:12,241
你要交給狄林傑？

645
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:17,578
不是給狄林傑

646
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:19,165
是給我

647
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,335
就這樣說定了？

648
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:01,081
我們說定了嗎？

649
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:04,335
對，我知道去哪找程式碼，快帶我離開

650
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:15,554
目標卌五秒後接近轉移入口

651
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:46,376
（離線）

652
00:59:46,377 --> 00:59:48,420
無人機故障、離線

653
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:19,117
註意

654
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:20,160
（轉移開始）

655
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:21,203
請保持距離

656
01:00:24,498 --> 01:00:26,624
覆寫指令無回應

657
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,543
怎麼了？ -誰授權的？

658
01:00:28,544 --> 01:00:29,627
（轉移開始）

659
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:31,046
這源自創界網絡內部

660
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:32,130
安全程序警報

661
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,214
朱利安？

662
01:00:33,215 --> 01:00:35,258
全體探員立刻向轉移層報到

663
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:36,801
清空本區域

664
01:00:36,802 --> 01:00:39,013
叫大家離開 -未授權列印進行中

665
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:42,183
清空中央區域

666
01:00:47,771 --> 01:00:49,231
轉移完成 -過去

667
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:08,167
（戰神）

668
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:12,420
唉呀呀

669
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:14,465
我被我的程式背叛了

670
01:01:15,132 --> 01:01:17,759
它自己想要恆久程式碼

671
01:01:19,428 --> 01:01:20,720
伊芙，你們講好了？

672
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:21,887
它帶你離開創界網絡

673
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:23,681
你把小木偶變成小男孩？

674
01:01:23,682 --> 01:01:25,725
你漏掉你為了一個軟體

675
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:26,934
不惜殺人的部份

676
01:01:26,935 --> 01:01:29,605
是它說的嗎？ -廿八分卌一秒

677
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:32,357
戰神

678
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:34,067
我希望你們心想事成

679
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:36,361
沒有第二次機會，無法重來

680
01:01:36,362 --> 01:01:39,031
這是你擁有的最後廿九分鐘

681
01:01:39,573 --> 01:01:40,824
最好善加利用

682
01:01:46,913 --> 01:01:48,790
（沙迪斯）

683
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,062
我眞該主修英文的

684
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:28,454
（戰神，雅典娜）

685
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:29,415
轉移完成

686
01:02:31,917 --> 01:02:33,376
你要找到伊芙金

687
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:36,046
送她回創界網絡，把恆久程式碼交給我

688
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:37,838
不擇手段

689
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,800
你瞭解你的指令嗎？

690
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:43,179
主控

691
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:51,687
遵命，長官

692
01:02:52,521 --> 01:02:53,355
乖女孩

693
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:14,626
時間有限

694
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:29,766
那是我見過最酷的東西

695
01:03:44,115 --> 01:03:45,448
知道凱文費林是誰嗎？

696
01:03:45,449 --> 01:03:48,118
當然，前衛程式設計師

697
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,619
數位新領域的先驅

698
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,412
一九八九年失蹤

699
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:53,999
我在費林伺服器的備份中發現恆久程式碼

700
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,502
那個伺服器在英克爾的市區辦公室

701
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:58,336
我們能在…

702
01:03:58,337 --> 01:03:59,838
廿六分零九秒內抵達

703
01:04:01,298 --> 01:04:04,009
伊芙，你的計畫有兩大缺失

704
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,135
好

705
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:07,762
第一，英克爾在十五公里外

706
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:10,723
而我們這輛車目前的速度欠佳

707
01:04:10,724 --> 01:04:11,807
天啊

708
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,894
第二，我們需要粒子雷射

709
01:04:15,437 --> 01:04:16,730
我們需要手機

710
01:04:31,912 --> 01:04:33,664
不敢相信我會這麼做

711
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:38,626
抱歉，看到沒？這是我

712
01:04:38,627 --> 01:04:42,880
讓我用你的手機，我助理會匯一萬元給你

713
01:04:42,881 --> 01:04:44,133
我需要你的手機

714
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:53,474
賽斯，你在哪？

715
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:55,310
伊芙，這是誰的手機？

716
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:58,229
聽我說，我要你十五分後到英克爾

717
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,564
情況都還好嗎？

718
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:02,483
賽斯，帶粒子雷射來

719
01:05:02,484 --> 01:05:03,902
英克爾，十五分鐘，瞭解

720
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:07,113
那是我的車

721
01:05:07,114 --> 01:05:08,323
我會再匯五萬元給你

722
01:05:08,324 --> 01:05:09,657
喂，那是我的車

723
01:05:09,658 --> 01:05:13,912
二點零四汽缸，一百卅八匹馬力

724
01:05:14,496 --> 01:05:15,580
差勁

725
01:05:15,581 --> 01:05:17,083
喂，那是我的車

726
01:05:17,874 --> 01:05:19,876
那是我的車

727
01:05:27,718 --> 01:05:29,720
（消解時間倒數）

728
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:43,234
天啊

729
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:46,736
伊芙 -如何？

730
01:05:46,737 --> 01:05:48,904
我在想你曾經告訴令妹

731
01:05:48,905 --> 01:05:51,907
你寧願從沒重啟過《瘋狂空間》

732
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:53,243
然後你又說…

733
01:05:53,244 --> 01:05:55,453
天啊，你當然看過我所有訊息

734
01:05:55,454 --> 01:05:58,706
對，我全看過，每一則

735
01:05:58,707 --> 01:05:59,790
哇

736
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:01,834
大多是私人性質的資訊

737
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:04,212
有些涉及高度隱私

738
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:06,965
我就是欲罷不能

739
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:08,884
什麼？

740
01:06:09,635 --> 01:06:10,926
流行尖端樂團

741
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:13,804
一九八二年英國單曲榜第八名

742
01:06:13,805 --> 01:06:15,931
他們的風格簡潔、朗朗上口

743
01:06:15,932 --> 01:06:17,433
經典的八零年代電音

744
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:20,354
令人十分振奮

745
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,447
十六分廿秒

746
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:36,452
好，你喜歡八零年代流行樂和數位監控我

747
01:06:36,453 --> 01:06:38,038
我的指令是殺你，伊芙

748
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:40,582
駭客行為相較之下溫和多了

749
01:06:44,211 --> 01:06:45,753
天啊 -我想聲明

750
01:06:45,754 --> 01:06:48,089
我認為你沒有什麼好羞愧的

751
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,883
《瘋狂空間》讓數億人得到娛樂

752
01:06:50,884 --> 01:06:52,511
而且是個滿酷的遊戲

753
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:55,471
總之，你跟你妹說設計遊戲

754
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:57,473
讓你感到空虛消沉

755
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:59,892
難道你的工作是娛樂和獲利

756
01:06:59,893 --> 01:07:02,478
她的工作是改善人類處境嗎？

757
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:04,564
你的訊息顯示你很在意

758
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:06,649
自己無法達到她的標準

759
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,359
那種感受一定很複雜

760
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,778
尤其她又是妹妹

761
01:07:10,779 --> 01:07:12,656
好，小心講話

762
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,367
對了，我認為你不該辭職

763
01:07:17,911 --> 01:07:19,245
什麼意思？

764
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:21,497
你從山上回來後的計畫

765
01:07:21,498 --> 01:07:22,582
如果我解讀正確

766
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,292
是把恆久程式碼交給英克爾

767
01:07:24,293 --> 01:07:27,004
讓他們去進行後續規劃，不是嗎？

768
01:07:30,966 --> 01:07:32,717
這下我懂了

769
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:36,222
你完成她的工作，藉此留住和她的連結

770
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:40,601
現在呢？

771
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:44,980
當人類很辛苦

772
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:47,898
讓生活美好的東西

773
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:53,239
也會帶來痛苦，像是愛、失去

774
01:07:55,866 --> 01:07:57,200
（至英克爾大樓時間）

775

（消解時間倒數）

776
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:02,081
你一定非常想她

777
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:15,510
喂…

778
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:16,594
搞什麼？

779
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:17,678
（英克爾）

780
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:18,929

781

（英克爾廣場南側）

782
01:08:20,641 --> 01:08:22,432
看誰來了 -嗨

783
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:24,852
很高興你來了，金小姐，大家都在找你

784
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:26,936
好久不見，有點趕，我就…

785
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:28,732
伊芙，你得戴識別證

786
01:08:29,275 --> 01:08:31,191
好，裘琳…

787
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:34,279
裘琳，她的識別證在這裡

788
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,406
也有他的嗎？

789
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:37,322
沒有，他不是一起的

790
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,617
他是 -他是

791
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:45,124
從哪裡說起都行啊

792
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:48,669
這是我的男友戰神

793
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,795
不是啦

戰神，他賽斯，賽斯，他戰神，天啊

796
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,342
幸會

797
01:08:57,343 --> 01:08:58,428
眞客氣

798
01:08:58,429 --> 01:09:01,472
戰神，是那個戰爭之神嗎？

799
01:09:03,142 --> 01:09:04,224
對

800
01:09:04,225 --> 01:09:06,561
酷，你是希臘人，好讚

801
01:09:06,562 --> 01:09:09,064
你說他是安全程式，意思是…

802
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:10,565
對，他不是人類 -他不是人類

806

你能處理嗎，賽斯？

807
01:09:20,701 --> 01:09:21,702
可以

808
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:24,329
我不需要幫忙

809
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,331
好

810

（凱文費林辦公室）

812
01:09:33,922 --> 01:09:38,344
我在這伺服器的備份裡發現恆久程式碼

813
01:09:44,183 --> 01:09:46,059
果眞是第一代

814
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,478
果眞很廢，對吧？

815
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,147
這樣講對你的祖先不敬，抱歉

816
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,691
我要幾分鐘才能組好

817

恆久程式碼在裡面 -我該預期什麼？

823
01:10:05,746 --> 01:10:08,539
要我猜的話，想想八零年代

824

八零年代

825
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:11,293
我喜歡八零年代

我會從外面啟動它

834
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:31,230
我可以信任你嗎？

835
01:10:34,858 --> 01:10:36,484
我希望可以

836
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:37,819
但應該不行 -應該不行

837
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,404
是啊

838

幸好我們沒有信任問題

839
01:10:41,323 --> 01:10:42,823
否則，我能想像…

840
01:10:42,824 --> 01:10:43,908
我能拔掉插頭

841
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:46,994
把你留在比我手機更低階的創界網絡

我想過這一點

844

01:18:47,934 --> 01:18:49,269
朱利安

920
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,479
你玩完了

921
01:18:51,022 --> 01:18:53,898
董事會現在要拔掉你的頭銜

922
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:56,151
我會重新接管公司

923
01:18:56,152 --> 01:18:58,403
不可以，不行

924
01:18:58,404 --> 01:19:00,113
我可以

925
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:01,907
不能這樣下去

926
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:04,118
你不能…

927
01:19:04,493 --> 01:19:06,119
我的當務之急

928
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,664
是關閉恆久計畫 -不…媽，嫑

929
01:19:14,253 --> 01:19:15,546
嫑怕

930
01:19:17,714 --> 01:19:19,758
我們為創界網絡死了上千次

931
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:25,222
你衹要死一次

932
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,848
不…

933
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:29,476
媽

934
01:19:35,274 --> 01:19:37,068
障礙已排除

935
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:40,821
你做了什麼？

936
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:44,325
我在執行我的指令

937
01:19:44,866 --> 01:19:48,662
逮捕伊芙金，不擇手段帶她回創界網絡

938
01:19:49,788 --> 01:19:51,707
掃描其他障礙

939
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:53,042
（掃描中）

940
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:58,839
請保持距離

941
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,352
撐住，媽，撐下去

942
01:20:14,438 --> 01:20:15,563
（轉移進行中）

943
01:20:15,564 --> 01:20:16,398
（覆寫遭拒）

944
01:20:18,025 --> 01:20:18,941
（殺光所有人）

945
01:20:18,942 --> 01:20:19,984
（覆寫遭拒）

946
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,445
不

947
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:26,802
費林

948
01:21:30,847 --> 01:21:32,474
你好，程式

949
01:21:55,706 --> 01:21:57,582
天啊，不妙

950
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:01,294
多人通報上層區域有失火與破壞…

951
01:22:01,295 --> 01:22:02,296
伊芙？

952
01:22:02,796 --> 01:22:04,380
我們辦公室怎麼了？

953
01:22:04,381 --> 01:22:05,840
亞傑，沒時間了

954
01:22:05,841 --> 01:22:07,967
狄林傑反轉粒子雷射的方向

955
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:09,635
把我送進他們的伺服器

956
01:22:09,636 --> 01:22:12,055
不是用這臺，是他們的 -不可能

957
01:22:12,056 --> 01:22:14,891
是一個瘋婆子幹的，她把我…很誇張

958
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:17,768
我看見一個複雜的世界

959
01:22:17,769 --> 01:22:20,063
能量包如同車輛般移動

960
01:22:20,064 --> 01:22:22,232
留下光的軌跡

961
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:25,027
程式擁有人類外型

962
01:22:25,694 --> 01:22:28,864
我見到有史以來最先進的人工智慧

963
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:30,490
他叫戰神

964
01:22:30,491 --> 01:22:32,575
戰爭之神，不過他人超好的

965
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,784
抱歉，繼續 -現在

966
01:22:33,785 --> 01:22:36,329
戰神在費林的原始伺服器裡

967
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,039
他在找恆久程式碼

968
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,501
我得帶他回來，而我要做到

969
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:43,254
就得修復這雷射

970
01:22:43,962 --> 01:22:46,964
我不懂，你是活的嗎？

971
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:50,511
我存在於這一刻裡，因為你也在

972
01:22:51,762 --> 01:22:54,473
你存在的映射

973
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:57,767
你是什麼來歷？

974
01:22:57,768 --> 01:23:01,397
我是戰神，狄林傑安全網絡的主控

975
01:23:02,273 --> 01:23:03,274
狄林傑？

976
01:23:05,526 --> 01:23:08,112
我們都知道你無法從那裡到這裡來

977
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:12,783
中間去過別的地方嗎？

978
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:16,577
對那裡有何看法？

979
01:23:16,578 --> 01:23:17,913
一言難盡

980
01:23:18,414 --> 01:23:19,915
你也能幫我說一遍

981
01:23:20,707 --> 01:23:22,418
一言難盡

982
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:27,798
眞妙，很幽默

983
01:23:31,635 --> 01:23:33,429
你在找什麼？

984
01:23:34,513 --> 01:23:35,472
恆久

985
01:23:38,184 --> 01:23:40,894
應該說恆久程式碼

986
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,479
近來發生了怪事

987
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,193
我質疑我的指令，違抗指令

988
01:23:49,236 --> 01:23:52,406
故障的程式想要活下去

989
01:23:52,906 --> 01:23:53,907
眞的嗎？

990
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:57,328
我為什麼該幫你？

991
01:23:57,828 --> 01:23:59,163
不，重點不是我

992
01:24:00,206 --> 01:24:01,831
已經不是了

993
01:24:01,832 --> 01:24:05,252
我有朋友身陷險境，她需要我幫忙

994
01:24:06,795 --> 01:24:08,130
有意思

995
01:24:11,925 --> 01:24:13,802
有意思

996
01:24:16,013 --> 01:24:18,599
亞傑，傳提示給我 -好

997
01:24:23,937 --> 01:24:25,938
伊芙 -先別煩我，賽斯

998
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:28,274
好，你確定嗎？

999
01:24:28,275 --> 01:24:31,987
好像有一架識別者往這邊飛來

1000
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:39,202
那是什麼東西？

1001
01:24:39,203 --> 01:24:40,162
是雅典娜

1002
01:24:40,746 --> 01:24:41,997
她回來了

1003
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:46,209
衹要狄林傑網絡上線，她就會一直來

1004
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:49,380
抓到我，她就能得到恆久程式碼

1005
01:24:51,673 --> 01:24:54,301
雷射，雅典娜的雷射

1006
01:24:54,926 --> 01:24:57,803
狄林傑使用一種無線直連協定

1007
01:24:57,804 --> 01:25:01,932
我們用剩下的雷射探測，追溯返航路徑

1008
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:05,436
一旦連線，就能破壞整個狄林傑網絡

1009
01:25:05,437 --> 01:25:08,149
那是唯一徹底阻止她的方法

1010
01:25:08,815 --> 01:25:10,901
伊芙，你在說什麼？她就在那裡

1011
01:25:14,946 --> 01:25:16,781
我該走了 -等下，什麼？

1012
01:25:16,782 --> 01:25:18,783
我會盡量牽制她

1013
01:25:18,784 --> 01:25:20,868
什麼？ -我幫你們爭取時間

1014
01:25:20,869 --> 01:25:22,621
伊芙 -你們可以的

1015
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:37,553
（追蹤目標中，伊芙金）

1016
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,853
沒錯，我應該有問題

1017
01:25:47,854 --> 01:25:51,442
或者，也許你有好的地方

1018
01:25:51,983 --> 01:25:53,777
也許你衹是在學習

1019
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,822
我們都應該那麼做

1020
01:25:57,948 --> 01:26:00,533
當年科技剛開始萌芽時

1021
01:26:00,534 --> 01:26:03,787
我會想：「我們進展得好快」

1022
01:26:04,663 --> 01:26:08,917
進展快，就會拋下一些東西

1023
01:26:10,377 --> 01:26:14,798
這世紀出生的人有多少個聽過莫札特？

1024
01:26:15,382 --> 01:26:16,842
我喜歡莫札特

1025
01:26:21,472 --> 01:26:24,683
但老實說，我比較喜歡流行尖端

1026
01:26:26,893 --> 01:26:29,604
是嗎？怎麼說？

1027
01:26:29,605 --> 01:26:31,772
一個被譽為西方文明史上

1028
01:26:31,773 --> 01:26:33,733
最偉大的作曲家

1029
01:26:33,734 --> 01:26:36,152
一個是八零年代的合成流行樂團

1030
01:26:36,153 --> 01:26:41,074
但他們的音樂兼具實驗性與流行元素

1031
01:26:41,075 --> 01:26:42,451
再加上…

1032
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:47,081
再加上…

1033
01:26:48,582 --> 01:26:49,957
怎麼了？

1034
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:53,378
我無法用言語形容對流行尖端的喜愛

1035
01:26:53,379 --> 01:26:55,214
那衹是…

1036
01:26:57,216 --> 01:26:59,760
什麼？

1037
01:27:01,262 --> 01:27:02,929
一種感覺

1038
01:27:06,683 --> 01:27:08,852
非常好

1039
01:27:10,937 --> 01:27:12,689
非常好

1040
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:23,783
一艘大如摩天樓的飛船剛進入本市領空

1041
01:27:23,784 --> 01:27:26,495
並前往市區…

1042
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:28,289
你…

1043
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:35,504
是你造成的

1044
01:27:40,926 --> 01:27:42,510
今晚，軍方…

1045
01:27:42,511 --> 01:27:45,680
了不起，完全分段的零信任架構

1046
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:48,599
可以抵禦垂直、橫向或混合攻擊

1047
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,060
（狄林傑網絡，連線中斷）

1048
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:52,687
可惡，連不上 -這裡也是

1049
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:53,980
（遭拒）

1050
01:27:57,026 --> 01:27:58,443
（瘋狂空間）

1051
01:27:58,444 --> 01:28:00,487
請立即撤離本區域

1052
01:28:27,264 --> 01:28:29,558
那是什麼？找反恐特警組 -請求支援

1053
01:28:32,228 --> 01:28:33,229
天啊

1054
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,481
天啊

1055
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,361
來啊，再靠近一點

1056
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:43,780
（伊芙金）

1057
01:29:15,562 --> 01:29:17,813
毒蛇一號呼叫基地，看見敵方

1058
01:29:17,814 --> 01:29:19,525
目視確認目標

1059
01:29:20,067 --> 01:29:22,278
攻擊，狐狸二號飛彈已發射

1060
01:29:30,744 --> 01:29:32,870
未命中，飛彈已被攔截

1061
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:36,458
註意，敵方護航戰鬥機快速逼近

1062
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:39,753
収到，渡鴉一號，評估威脅態勢

1063
01:29:47,136 --> 01:29:48,969
毒蛇一號，看見多架敵機

1064
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:50,806
確認對方有敵意

1065
01:29:51,182 --> 01:29:52,849
求救…我被擊中了

1066
01:29:55,936 --> 01:29:57,313
毒蛇一號，彈射逃生

1067
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:09,700
（發射）

1068
01:30:19,793 --> 01:30:21,628
各位，各位

1069
01:30:22,254 --> 01:30:23,630
天啊，有幾百個

1070
01:30:24,881 --> 01:30:26,133
他們在追伊芙

1071
01:30:26,633 --> 01:30:29,553
進不了狄林傑伺服器就沒東西可救了

1072
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:13,388
渡鴉一號呼叫基地，敵機發動攻擊

1073
01:31:13,389 --> 01:31:14,640
我在防禦狀態

1074
01:31:17,768 --> 01:31:20,479
有多架敵機，轉向主要目標

1075
01:31:21,813 --> 01:31:23,399
我被擊中了，彈射逃生

1076
01:32:15,409 --> 01:32:16,452
準備好了嗎？

1077
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:21,207
希望如此，無法回頭了

1078
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:24,960
恆久

1079
01:32:25,502 --> 01:32:26,503
說來好玩

1080
01:32:28,172 --> 01:32:30,299
我發現它時就是這麼叫它

1081
01:32:32,218 --> 01:32:33,635
我現在學聰明了

1082
01:32:38,932 --> 01:32:42,103
應該叫短暫程式碼

1083
01:32:59,995 --> 01:33:02,539
後門通往我的舊實驗室

1084
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:06,377
一次機會

1085
01:33:07,711 --> 01:33:09,255
你衹有一次

1086
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:17,596
一次機會…

1087
01:33:19,765 --> 01:33:21,100
就是我要的

1088
01:33:21,767 --> 01:33:23,185
我喜歡

1089
01:33:23,894 --> 01:33:26,063
你不斷令我驚奇

1090
01:34:30,502 --> 01:34:32,588
那我們就在地面進行

1091
01:34:39,178 --> 01:34:40,762
（創界網絡）

1092
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:06,913
（費林）

1093
01:35:29,103 --> 01:35:31,813
（抵達轉移區所需時間）

1094
01:35:35,401 --> 01:35:37,777
據報上面可能有一個平民

1095
01:35:37,778 --> 01:35:40,363
代表可能有人遭到挾持

1096
01:35:40,364 --> 01:35:42,948
雅典娜，她一定抓到伊芙了

1097
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:44,035
進入山區

1098
01:35:45,702 --> 01:35:47,121
喂…

1099
01:35:54,586 --> 01:35:56,380
我們很快就回創界網絡

1100
01:37:01,737 --> 01:37:04,780
將軍，感謝你今晚撥空接受訪問

1101
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:06,574
艾琳，賽斯

1102
01:37:06,575 --> 01:37:07,950
（連接狄林傑網絡中）

1103
01:37:07,951 --> 01:37:08,826
（連線已建立）

1104
01:37:08,827 --> 01:37:10,412
停止計時器

1105
01:37:11,205 --> 01:37:12,913
不會吧，你進去了？

1106
01:37:12,914 --> 01:37:15,209
我用角落辦公室是有原因的

1107
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:21,923
嘿

1108
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:28,222
你回來了

1109
01:37:30,266 --> 01:37:31,391
你怎麼…

1110
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,519
姑且說我有朋友幫忙

1111
01:37:35,937 --> 01:37:38,440
等下，狄林傑網絡…

1112
01:37:39,525 --> 01:37:41,235
亞傑和賽斯…

1113
01:37:57,501 --> 01:37:58,876
快走 -不

1114
01:37:58,877 --> 01:38:00,586
戰神

1115
01:38:00,587 --> 01:38:02,881
（戰神，消解錯誤）

1116
01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:05,341
你做了什麼？

1117
01:38:05,342 --> 01:38:07,135
你沒時間了，雅典娜

1118
01:38:07,136 --> 01:38:08,844
而你要沒命了

1119
01:38:08,845 --> 01:38:10,764
我會殺了你，再回來找她

1120
01:38:22,943 --> 01:38:24,777
她要的是你

1121
01:38:24,778 --> 01:38:26,697
讓她拿到程式碼就完了

1122
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:29,824
你曾擁有一切

1123
01:38:29,825 --> 01:38:31,326
快跑 -不

1124
01:38:31,327 --> 01:38:35,122
最先進、最強大的能力，你卻輕易放棄

1125
01:38:36,165 --> 01:38:37,248
為了她？

1126
01:38:37,249 --> 01:38:38,459
快跑

1127
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,545
這是你的末日

1128
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:28,675
有效負載準備轉移

1129
01:39:29,426 --> 01:39:30,843
運送中

1130
01:39:30,844 --> 01:39:31,927
（狄林傑，執行網絡清除，自毀）

1131
01:39:31,928 --> 01:39:32,887
（傳送有效負載）

1132
01:39:32,888 --> 01:39:33,889
希望伊芙是對的

1133
01:39:35,141 --> 01:39:37,934
警告，不明檔案傳入

1134
01:39:48,695 --> 01:39:50,530
為了自己追求生命

1135
01:39:50,531 --> 01:39:53,200
你考慮過這對創界網絡的影響嗎？

1136
01:40:41,665 --> 01:40:44,793
我們接到命令，它是我們的使命

1137
01:41:07,024 --> 01:41:08,359
它不是我們的使命

1138
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:10,652
是我們的設定

1139
01:41:11,737 --> 01:41:14,823
我們的使命尚未決定

1140
01:41:23,457 --> 01:41:25,625
（連接狄林傑網絡中）

1141
01:41:25,626 --> 01:41:27,086
（連線失敗）

1142
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:31,507
（系統離線）

1143
01:41:37,804 --> 01:41:39,015
結束了

1144
01:41:41,808 --> 01:41:43,477
無法回頭了

1145
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:48,482
不

1146
01:41:50,026 --> 01:41:51,027
這次不行

1147
01:41:59,576 --> 01:42:00,786
他們成功了

1148
01:42:02,163 --> 01:42:03,497
天啊

1149
01:42:11,047 --> 01:42:12,630
我遵照我的指令

1150
01:42:12,631 --> 01:42:14,133
我知道

1151
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:17,553
現在…

1152
01:42:18,762 --> 01:42:20,014
你的指令是什麼？

1153
01:42:25,727 --> 01:42:27,354
我不確定

1154
01:42:29,106 --> 01:42:30,982
到時候就知道了

1155
01:42:54,006 --> 01:42:56,549
狄林傑系統今晚面臨嚴密蒐查

1156
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:59,385
外界懷疑它可能涉及

1157
01:42:59,386 --> 01:43:02,805
使本市陷入動蕩的一連串毀滅性攻擊

1158
01:43:02,806 --> 01:43:05,725
聯邦當局已證實正積極調查

1159
01:43:05,726 --> 01:43:07,602
該公司近期的活動

1160
01:43:07,603 --> 01:43:11,106
許多事件直接指向執行長朱利安狄林傑

1161
01:43:11,107 --> 01:43:14,859
當局已指派探員訊問執行長與他的母親

1162
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:15,943
聯絡董事會…

1163
01:43:15,944 --> 01:43:16,986
（系統嚴重故障）

1164
01:43:16,987 --> 01:43:17,903
（雷射校正中）

1165
01:43:17,904 --> 01:43:19,530
釐清相關情形

1166
01:43:19,531 --> 01:43:21,741
此外，本市依然一片混亂

1167
01:43:21,742 --> 01:43:24,119
急難救護單位不堪負荷

1168
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:27,414
有整片區域遭到大規模破壞

1169
01:43:27,999 --> 01:43:28,624
（關閉）

1170
01:43:38,425 --> 01:43:39,634
（重啟雷射中）

1171
01:43:39,635 --> 01:43:40,761
（重啟失敗）

1172
01:43:42,054 --> 01:43:44,555
朱利安狄林傑，我們是警察

1173
01:43:44,556 --> 01:43:46,724
你被包圍了

1174
01:43:46,725 --> 01:43:48,893
開門，高舉雙手走出來

1175
01:43:48,894 --> 01:43:50,062
（雷射系統上線）

1176
01:43:53,524 --> 01:43:54,858
（上線）

1177
01:43:56,985 --> 01:43:57,819
快啊

1178
01:43:58,279 --> 01:43:59,238
（雷射校正中）

1179
01:44:04,493 --> 01:44:05,618
（轉移已反轉）

1180
01:44:05,619 --> 01:44:06,912
破門

1181
01:44:08,997 --> 01:44:09,831
警察！

1182
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:13,335
待在原地

1183
01:44:19,216 --> 01:44:21,217
繼續監控所有出口

1184
01:44:21,218 --> 01:44:24,512
查理九號，我們在最後指定位置…

1185
01:44:24,513 --> 01:44:27,141
黃色六號，在前面，快去…

1186
01:44:36,108 --> 01:44:37,400
你還好嗎？

1187
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:39,611
好像有肋骨斷了

1188
01:44:45,701 --> 01:44:47,036
你還會辭職嗎？

1189
01:44:49,538 --> 01:44:52,582
不，我不會放棄任何東西

1190
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:53,750
很好

1191
01:44:54,335 --> 01:44:55,418
很好

1192
01:44:55,419 --> 01:44:57,421
我有一些想法

1193
01:44:58,464 --> 01:45:00,257
是嗎？很好 -嗯

1194
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,385
這世界需要你，伊芙

1195
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:05,804
創界網絡需要你

1196
01:45:09,308 --> 01:45:11,393
說來奇怪，恆久…

1197
01:45:12,186 --> 01:45:15,606
有個智者說它應該叫「短暫程式碼」

1198
01:45:17,316 --> 01:45:19,567
我想那就是生命的特點

1199
01:45:19,568 --> 01:45:21,987
沒有什麼是恆久的

1200
01:45:25,366 --> 01:45:26,616
沒錯

1201
01:45:26,617 --> 01:45:28,619
確實沒有

1202
01:45:31,288 --> 01:45:32,414
是啊

1203
01:45:43,592 --> 01:45:45,136
你要去哪裡？

1204
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:48,139
我有一些想法

1205
01:46:18,919 --> 01:46:23,089
英克爾在執行長伊芙金領導下

1206
01:46:23,090 --> 01:46:24,215
推動產業轉型

1207
01:46:24,216 --> 01:46:25,300
（費林不死）

1208
01:46:25,301 --> 01:46:28,594
以過去難以想像的方式形塑生活

1209
01:46:28,595 --> 01:46:31,431
由於發現了恆久程式碼

1210
01:46:31,432 --> 01:46:34,142
該公司取得了革命性的進展

1211
01:46:34,143 --> 01:46:36,977
在氣候脆弱區域種植作物

1212
01:46:36,978 --> 01:46:39,939
針對耐藥性癌癥研發藥物

1213
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:43,359
以及加速替代燃料的開發

1214
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:47,613
英克爾致力於探索數位新領域

1215
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:51,659
推動科技與生命的融合發展

1216
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,079
以改善人類的生活品質

1217
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:58,167
事實上，創新始終是英克爾的核心

1218
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:01,461
八零年代，深具遠見的凱文費林

1219
01:47:01,462 --> 01:47:03,129
想像一個遊戲之外的未來

1220
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:06,591
大膽躍入數位新領域

1221
01:47:06,592 --> 01:47:08,844
如今，那個願景已經成眞

1222
01:47:13,057 --> 01:47:14,391
我差點忘了

1223
01:47:15,684 --> 01:47:17,893
明信片？誰還用郵寄的？ -不知道

1224
01:47:17,894 --> 01:47:19,188
我沒看

1225
01:47:24,026 --> 01:47:25,194
親愛的伊芙

1226
01:47:26,237 --> 01:47:27,528
自從上次見到你

1227
01:47:27,529 --> 01:47:31,200
我都過著所謂的「外網絡」生活

1228
01:47:31,867 --> 01:47:33,285
我故意用雙關語

1229
01:47:34,328 --> 01:47:37,664
我在旅行中見到不可思議的事物

1230
01:47:38,749 --> 01:47:43,379
儘管奇妙、美麗，我卻發覺生活…

1231
01:47:44,213 --> 01:47:46,215
呃，一言難盡

1232
01:47:46,965 --> 01:47:50,801
有時我會想百年後我們會在哪裡

1233
01:47:50,802 --> 01:47:52,512
（神秘夥伴在英克爾有何角色？）

1234
01:47:52,513 --> 01:47:54,473
跟我同類的人如何融入未來

1235
01:47:56,850 --> 01:48:00,271
我覺得可能不衹有我有這些疑問

1236
01:48:01,355 --> 01:48:04,775
現在，我想世人還沒準備要認識我

1237
01:48:05,817 --> 01:48:08,070
但我正在認識這個世界

1238
01:48:09,446 --> 01:48:12,366
所以，等那一刻終於來臨

1239
01:48:13,825 --> 01:48:15,701
就像我一個好友說的

1240
01:48:15,702 --> 01:48:20,457
「或許未知帶來的終究沒那麼可怕」

1241
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,543
（半圓頂小屋）

1242
01:48:23,544 --> 01:48:25,337
期待再相見

1243
01:48:25,837 --> 01:48:28,465
你的朋友戰神上

1244
01:48:39,726 --> 01:48:42,771
（英克爾）

1245
01:50:50,441 --> 01:50:51,733
薩克…
