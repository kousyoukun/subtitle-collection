You still gonna quit your job?

1457
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:46,408
No, I'm not gonna quit anything.

1458
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:47,658
Good.

1459
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:49,241
Good.

1460
01:44:49,325 --> 01:44:51,325
I have some ideas.

Oh, yeah? Nice.

1462
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,283
Well, the world needs you, Eve.

1463

The Grid needs you.

Yeah. It's funny, permanence.

1466
01:45:06,075 --> 01:45:07,075
A wise man once told me

1467
01:45:07,158 --> 01:45:09,491
it should have been called
the "Impermanence Code."

1468
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,366
I guess that's
the thing about life.

1469
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:15,866
There's nothing
quite permanent about it.

1470
01:45:19,241 --> 01:45:20,408
No.

1471
01:45:20,491 --> 01:45:22,491
No, there isn't.

1472
01:45:25,158 --> 01:45:26,283
Yeah.

<i>since I last saw you,</i>

1504

to put in a nutshell.</i>

1510
