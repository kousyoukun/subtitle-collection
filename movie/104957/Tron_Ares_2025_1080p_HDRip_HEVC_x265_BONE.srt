1
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,190
The Grid.

2
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:30,366
A digital frontier.

3
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,890
A world beyond the screen
as real as our own.

4
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:36,726
I can picture it.

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,010
Clusters of information rising like cities.

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,810
Programs as complex as you and me.

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,250
In just a few years we're gonna
be able to enter this world.

8
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,870
And a few years after that, well,
this world will come into ours.

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,470
Intelligent life from inside the machine.

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,990
I, for one, can't wait to meet him.

11
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,490
<i>Our lead story; ENCOM CEO and video
game icon Kevin Flynn has disappeared.</i>

12
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,070
<i>He was best known for designing
Tron and Space Paranoids,</i>

13
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,450
<i>the best selling video games in history.</i>

14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,330
<i>The company that started at
Kevin Flynn's arcade in the 1980's</i>

15
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,950
<i>has faced years of corporate turmoil.</i>

16
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:21,174
<i>Can it find its way to the victory screen once again?</i>

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,490
<i>It's a sister act for ENCOM.</i>

18
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:26,914
<i>Eve and Tess Kim take the reins
of the massive tech company</i>

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,780
<i>after Sam Flynn resigned
for personal reasons.</i>

20
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,430
<i>ENCOM's rebound under the Kim sisters leadership</i>

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,490
<i>has competitors rushing to respond.</i>

22
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:38,466
<i>Software giant Dillinger Systems
appoints its new CEO,</i>

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,170
<i>Julian Dillinger, who vows to
restore his grandfather's legacy.</i>

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,270
<i>The race between ENCOM and Dillinger
Systems heats up as new CEOs</i>

25
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,854
<i>Julian Dillinger and the Kim sisters square off.</i>

26
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,665
<i>Here at ENCOM, we believe the beauty of AI</i>

27
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:56,430
<i>is not the ability to build smarter
weapons but to uplift humanity.</i>

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,810
<i>Feed the hungry, cure the sick, educate the world.</i>

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,944
<i>Rival CEO's Julian Dillinger and Eve Kim
have gone quiet in recent months,</i>

30
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:10,065
<i>raising speculation the two companies are very close
to a substantial technological breakthrough.</i>

31
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:14,925
<i>One that has the potential to transform humanity
in ways we have never seen before.</i>

32
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:18,925
<i>The future may well lie in the
hands of whoever gets there first.</i>

33
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,670
<b>Welcome.</b>

34
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,770
Who are you?

35
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
<b>I am your creator.</b>

36
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,140
And who am I?

37
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,020
<b>Not who. What?</b>

38
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,660
<b>You are Dillinger Systems security software.</b>

39
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,760
<b>Program name, Ares.</b>

40
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,680
<b>Defender of the Grid.</b>

41
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,820
<b>You are Master Control.</b>

42
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Ares.
I am Master Control.

43
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,920
So, you made it.

44
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,730
I had a feeling that you would.

45
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,149
I always dreamed that we would do this together.

46
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,870
I'll admit, not exactly like this.

47
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,970
But, I'm glad you're here.

48
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,250
I'm really glad. And Evie, remember.

49
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,470
I'm still here, even if you can't see me.

50
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:41,755
I love you.

51
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,070
Oh, Eve.

52
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,770
I'm not sure you actually told me we'd be
stealing energy from the power grid.

53
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,770
Wow.

54
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,220
So this is where she kept coming back to, huh?

55
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,470
To be this disconnected from the world...

56
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
That is dedication, my friend.

57
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,495
Wow.
It looks like your sister had a little crush.

58
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,970
Yeah. She was so sure Flynn left us the answer.

59
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,820
Like, on a floppy disk?
Poor Flynn lived before the cloud, huh?

60
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Hey, are you still gonna be doing
CEO type stuff while we're out here?

61
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,090
You know, like earnings calls and
the launch of Panic City and stuff?

62
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,400
Let's just get this done.

63
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,800
Dude, I can make breakfast burritos right here.

64
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Hell, yeah.

65
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
This is for you, Tess.

66
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,340
Members of the board.

67
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:50,080
For over 40 years, my family at Dillinger Systems
has battled ENCOM for control of the future.

68
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,200
You put me in charge of the
company to ensure our victory.

69
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,760
Today, I make it so.

70
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,180
Imagine if all our digital prowess wasn't just digital.

71
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,480
What if anything we could dream in the
machine could become a reality here?

72
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,620
What if we could build the bridge
between two previously walled-off worlds?

73
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,260
So much talk of AI and big tech today.

74
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,380
Virtual worlds, what are they gonna look like?
When will we get there?

75
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,360
Well, folks, we're not going there.

76
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,400
They are coming here.

77
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,460
[ATTENTION]

78
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,400
[PLEASE PUT ON YOUR SAFETY GLASSES NOW]

79
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,510
Laser systems activated.
Power fluctuations are nominal.

80
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,790
[WARNING]
[STAND CLEAR]

81
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,770
Outputting from Dillinger Systems server.

82
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,330
Raw material inflow initiated.

83
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:11,054
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7 -

84
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:16,978
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

85
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:20,102
Transfer complete.

86
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:26,030
I present the Dillinger Systems
amphibious rapid response tank.

87
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,090
The D.A.R.T.

88
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,350
Digitally modeled inside our server
outproducing our patented laser technology.

89
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:34,674
With an M-1 rifle gun. Two M-240 machine guns.

90
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,750
It's got a top speed of 75 miles per hour.

91
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,650
Durability? You find a wall,
this thing is gonna drive through it.

92
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,120
This is full scale war. Five minutes notice.

93
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,440
So, if we can create the hardware of the future,

94
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,705
then why not the soldier to operate it?

95
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like you to meet Ares.

96
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,680
This is the most sophisticated
security program ever written.

97
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,880
You want to shake his hand?
Go ahead. He doesn't bite.

98
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,100
Ares has billions of lines of code unique to him.

99
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:32,924
Is it alive?

100
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,580
That depends on your definition, Stewart.

101
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Because unlike you, he's biblically strong,
lightning fast and supremely intelligent.

102
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:49,214
He is fully proprietary and 100% expendable.

103
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,160
Ares is the ultimate soldier.
He needs no food, no water, sheds no blood.

104
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,960
And if, by some miracle, he is
struck down on the battlefield,

105
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
I will simply make you another.

106
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,590
With all that sophisticated code,
what makes you think you can contain it?

107
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:21,775
I can assure you, General, the most advanced failsafe
mechanisms and restriction protocols are in place.

108
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,090
Ares is predictable, controllable, and fully alive.

109
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,780
Southerly front with isentropic left turning cyclonic.
Predicted precipitation, 2.6 inches.

110
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,040
I hope that you brought your umbrellas.

111
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,540
I have to hand it to you, Julian.
You promised a big win.

112
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,865
And this is even bigger than
any of us could've imagined.

113
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:47,956
Thank you.

114
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,420
My grandfather started Dillinger Corporation long
before anybody heard the term "cyber security".

115
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,910
Military AI is the future.

116
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,650
The question is not whether the car should be built.

117
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,010
The car is being built right now.

118
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,670
The question is, who's holding the keys?

119
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,910
That was quite some parlor trick.

120
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,910
Time?

121
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,846
44 seconds.

122
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,530
"I hope you brought your umbrellas?"

123
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,270
Oh, was that in the script or
was he just having a moment?

124
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,270
Elizabeth Dillinger, eldest daughter
of founder, Edward Dillinger, deceased.

125
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,790
Longtime CEO during a relatively unremarkable period

126
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,950
of corporate history before being
superseded by your only son.

127
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,780
It's a pleasure.

128
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,956
"Unremarkable?"

129
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,640
Market share was up 12% during my tenure.
That's hardly...

130
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,340
Anyway, we don't say superseded. We...

131
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,860
We call it giving birth.

132
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,684
Of course.

133
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,020
It's an honor to meet my creator's creator.

134
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,515
Oh, here we go.

135
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,550
I noticed you left out the part
where you can't seem to keep

136
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,371
this thing of yours alive for more than twenty-five minutes.

137
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:46,967
Twenty-nine.

138
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:51,211
Deceiving your investors, Julian,
is hardly a business model.

139
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,030
Whoever controls the Permanence Code controls the future.

140
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,638
We have to win.

141
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,401
Look, I...

142
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,125
admire your vision.

143
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:10,749
Straighten up.

144
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:14,461
However, the board will only stand behind you

145
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:18,985
for another six months if you're lucky.

146
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,721
But if it doesn't work,

147
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,981
all of this goes away, darling.

148
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:31,021
Everything we have built

149
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:33,241
for the past fourty years.

150
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,041
What if I said I'd found a way?

151
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:09,171
I think this is my ninety-fifth breakfast burrito and,

152
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:13,091
honestly, can't get enough.
Isn't that wild?

153
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,920
Well,

154
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,620
Nice to see Tess wasn't the
only obsessive one in the family.

155
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,480
Yeah, Seth, you're right. Sorry. Should've paid
more attention to you. Oh, don't worry about it.

156
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Okay...

157
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,791
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here.

158
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:49,404
Look, three months in sub zero
is a long time, I get it.

159
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:55,244
Yeah, four days, ten hours, thirty-two minutes.
Who's counting, really? You know...

160
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,111
Hold on.

161
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:01,735
What do you mean?

162
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:04,159
What?

163
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,351
Seth?

164
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,941
- What, you found something?
- I think so.

165
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,931
The line of code.

166
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,955
That's how he hid it.
It's two lines.

167
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,351
Wow...

168
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,175
That looks like a double helix.

169
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,371
It is a double helix.

170
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:45,931
Tess would have loved this.

171
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:49,055
Wait, are you serious?
So, no more 29 minutes now?

172
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:53,511
If this is what I think it is,
it's the Permanence Code.

173
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:05,601
ENCOM, offline child 317 A-1.

174
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,925
Permanence Code implemented.

175
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:10,541
Testing for asset stability
beyond current 29 minute barrier.

176
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,665
Go.

177
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,831
Ready when you are.

178
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,255
Okay.

179
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,931
It's all in the wrist, baby.

180
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,055
God, that never gets old.

181
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:09,036
Trial online.

182
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,781
Twenty-nine minutes and counting down.

183
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,791
Let's see if you last this time.

184
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,591
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

185
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:38,681
If, by some miracle, he's
struck down on the battlefield,

186
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,905
I will simply make you another.

187
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:47,621
Fully proprietary, 100% Expendable.

188
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,001
Athena.

189
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:55,525
Welcome back, sir.
All units are online and ready for inspection.

190
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:58,521
So, how was was it?

191
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:00,845
It was interesting. Different this time.

192
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,121
I met a mother and a son.

193
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,645
It was raining.

194
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:10,051
The condensed moisture of the
atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops.

195
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:12,951
I could almost feel it.

196
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:14,871
Feel?

197
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:17,895
I don't understand.

198
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:29,191
This is Eve. Get sensible and text.

199
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:31,711
Hey, Eve, it's Erin.
Got AJ for you again.

200
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,548
Hit us back.
Still straight to voicemail.

201
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:40,671
CEO of a Fortune 500 company and
your phone's down on our biggest night?

202
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:43,791
Goddam it.
Where the hell are you, Eve?

203
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:55,216
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

204
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:12,381
Did we just do it?
Dude, it's still there!

205
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,361
Did we just change the world, man?!

206
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,021
<i>Big news out of ENCOM tonight.</i>

207
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:24,848
<i>CEO Eve Kim will not attend the
highly anticipated launch event</i>

208
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:28,551
<i>for the company's new game,
Space Paranoids: Panic City.</i>

209
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:34,311
<i>Kim, the visionary designer behind the
re-launch of the Blockbuster franchise...</i>

210
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:39,268
Well, I spoke to several of our board members
and, needless to say, they are impressed.

211
00:22:39,351 --> 00:22:40,811
Julian?

212
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,330
What are you doing?

213
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,950
Oh, just trying to change the world, Mother.

214
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,907
What's going on?

215
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,761
You're hacking ENCOM?

216
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:54,085
Just a peek over the garden wall.
No one will notice.

217
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:56,321
What makes you think that ENCOM
is any closer to finding it?

218
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,279
Because I know who else
is looking for it, all right?

219
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,597
Who?

220
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:02,901
Eve Kim.

221
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:04,925
She's following in her sister's footsteps.

222
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:08,101
She's after the Permanence Code.
I can feel it. So I'm gonna find her.

223
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:09,227
- And when I get...
- No...

224
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,851
No. I don't like it. It's too risky, Julian.

225
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,931
Oops.

226
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:50,171
Security breach in all zones.

227
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:56,591
Programs, our directive is clear.

228
00:24:56,615 --> 00:25:00,867
Penetrate the server core and
extract Eve Kim's user file.

229
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:05,553
That is 5, 4, 3...

230
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,667
Space Paranoids fans!

231
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:09,951
Are you ready?

232
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:14,591
Put your hands together for ENCOM CTO,

233
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:16,451
- Ajay Singh!
- It's cowboy time.

234
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,375
- Get loud!
- Oh, no...

235
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,999
Whoo! Nice to see you!

236
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,511
Hello! Thank you!

237
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,351
What's up, Paranoia-Con?

238
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,451
I'm going in.

239
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,711
I'm in. I'm a genius.

240
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,068
Who knew you raised a genius, Mother?

241
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,068
I'm in!

242
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,870
In deep shit.

243
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:40,031
Initiate containment protocols
before all-network access.

244
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:41,755
We need a response now.

245
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:45,901
Initiate security protocol.

246
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,650
<i>...trusting artificial intelligence with their lives.</i>

247
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,410
<i>Are you comfortable with this?</i>

248
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,010
<i>Well, look, for every doomsday scenario,</i>

249
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,510
<i>there is a medical breakthrough,
scientific discovery.</i>

250
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,870
<i>So maybe what emerges
from the unknown isn't so scary.</i>

251
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:09,381
<i>What if its major malfunction
is just benevolence?</i>

252
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:13,531
What is this? What's he doing?

253
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:17,531
<i>But still, would you prefer to talk to a real person?</i>

254
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:22,511
<i>Of course, but what if that person
is no longer in your life?</i>

255
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,041
<i>No longer here.</i>

256
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,500
I've got the file.

257
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:40,751
Congratulations...
Now, get out of there while you still can.

258
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:53,851
Programs. We fight.

259
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:20,871
Yes! Thank you so much!
what do Paranoiacs do?

260
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,095
Grind you into dust!

261
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
Caius!

262
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,419
He's dysfuctional. Leave him!

263
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,061
You're gonna make it, Caius.

264
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:05,105
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
your knight to expose their queen.

265
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:37,080
To debut the latest version of
Space Paranoids: Panic City with the world.

266
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:39,596
- What is this?
- This is crazy.

267
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,720
- Vid screens down.
- Okay...

268
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,020
This is, uh, a technical difficulty.
We'll be back.

269
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,730
<b>Well done, Master Control.</b>

270
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,621
<b>Eve Kim's file aquired.</b>

271
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:54,873
<b>Objective achieved.</b>

272
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:04,151
Sir. I'm curious why the program
Caius was not reconstituted.

273
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,271
<b>I'm curious why you are curious.</b>

274
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:13,830
<b>Caius was dysfunctional so he was deleted.</b>

275
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:19,891
Just like any program...

276
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:23,212
<b>that operates outside their directive can be.</b>

277
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:25,536
<b>Do you understand?</b>

278
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:33,971
<b>Acknowledge, Master Control.</b>

279
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,071
Of course.

280
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:39,995
We are 100% expendable.

281
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,235
<b>New mission, Master Control.</b>

282
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,275
<b>Locate Eve Kim.</b>

283
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,491
Yes, sir.

284
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:50,115
Seems like we had a little cyber breach, Jules.

285
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,191
But then, of course, you knew that.

286
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:53,931
And it looks like the whole world knows, buddy.

287
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,691
I want to stay off the Socials for a few days.

288
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:57,427
You want to play games with me?
Let's play games. Julian.

289
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:00,027
You know, I heard about your
cute little pitch to the board.

290
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,638
But you left off one key detail from your deck.

291
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:05,691
Did you tell him the shot clock expires at 29 minutes?

292
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,411
Don't make me call the Journal and tell
'em you're making promises you can't keep.

293
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:13,322
Promises? What, you mean like the one that your
CEO would be in-office running the company?

294
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:15,351
Something in the water over there, A.J?

295
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,096
I mean, first wonder boy, Sam Flynn, now his successor.

296
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:21,191
Where is she, AJ?
Do you even know where she is?

297
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:23,615
Maybe you're right.
Maybe Eve went nuts.

298
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:26,591
Maybe she went AWOL and left the country.

299
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:31,136
Or maybe she's holed up off the grid
looking for the same thing you are.

300
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:33,664
And I know who my money's on.

301
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:37,088
You mean what's left of it after tonight.
End of line!

302
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:40,721
I hate that man.

303
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,561
Thank you so much.

304
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:48,285
You know I made those oranges.
It's a long story.

305
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,961
What are you doing?

306
00:31:55,985 --> 00:31:58,785
1913 messages. Popular.

307
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,781
Oh, it's A.J. Yeah, that's you.

308
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,271
A.J. Are you there?

309
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:05,191
Am I here?

310
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,615
A brute force attack took down our servers
during our product launch in years.

311
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:11,691
Everything we built is melting down.
You need to get back here right now.

312
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:16,411
I found it, A.J. It's real.
Right where Tess thought it would be.

313
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,999
Flynn had it all along.

314
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,723
Are you talking about the Permanence Code?

315

What happened back there?

479
00:56:57,145 --> 00:56:59,245
I disobeyed my directive.

480
00:56:59,301 --> 00:57:00,401
Which was?

481
00:57:00,425 --> 00:57:03,525
To retrieve the code from your
disk and delete the carrier.

482
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:07,761
Dillinger told you to delete me?

483
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,761
Hang on!

484
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:18,161
Where are they?

485
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,185
Scanning quadrants three and four.

486
00:57:20,211 --> 00:57:21,911
Sector 18 clear.

487
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:26,531
Where are we going?

488
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:28,055
Transfer portal.

489
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,731
It's the only way out of the grid.

490
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:34,402
You'll be reconstituted in the real world
exactly as you were before, hypothetically.

491
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:38,831
- Hypothetically?
- Probably.

492
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,155
We have movement in sector 72.

493
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:43,591
Zeroing in on target.

495
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,440
You want to get home, I can help you.
But I need something in return.

496
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:03,311
I told you I don't have the code.

497
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:06,271
You found it once. You can find it again.

498
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:08,511
So you can give it to Dillinger?

499
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:15,061
Not for Dillinger. For me.

500
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:19,221
Do we have a deal?

501
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,350
So, do we have a deal?

502
00:58:57,405 --> 00:58:59,305
Yes. Yes. I know where to find the code.

503
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,170

Well, well, well.
Just got double crossed by my program.

518
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:13,831
It wants the permanence code for itself.

519
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,191
Eve, is that the deal?

520
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:19,315
It gets you out of the grid,
you turn "Pinocchio" into to a real boy?

521
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:23,087
Well, you're missing the part where you're
willing to commit murder for a piece of software.

Ares! I do hope this works out for you.

524
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:32,364
There's no second chances, no do-overs.

These are the last 29 minutes you'll ever have.

Your directive is to find Eve Kim,

01:02:31,899 --> 01:02:33,639
By any means necessary.

Now that is the coolest thing I have ever seen.

536
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,630
Do you know who Kevin Flynn was?

537
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:43,650
Of course. Visionary programmer.

538
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,110
Pioneered the Digital Frontier.
Disappeared 1989.

539
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,680
I found the permanence code on a backup of Flynn's server.
That server is at ENCOM's office downtown.

540
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:56,781
- So we can make it within...
- 26 minutes 9 seconds.

541
01:03:57,481 --> 01:04:00,581
Eve, your plan contains two major flaws.

542
01:04:00,605 --> 01:04:01,505
Okay.

543
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,625
One, ENCOM is 9.2 miles away.

544
01:04:03,786 --> 01:04:07,546
Given our present speed and
sub-optimal choice of vehicle.

545
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:10,081
- Oh, my god.
- Two, we're going to need a particle laser.

546
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,080
We need a phone.

547
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:30,151
Not believing it is.

548
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:34,651
Excuse me. Do you see this? This is me.

549
01:04:34,672 --> 01:04:38,532
If you let me use your cell phone,
my assistant will wire you $10,000.

550
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:39,551
I just need your phone.

551
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:49,381
Seth, where are you?

552
01:04:49,405 --> 01:04:51,105
Eve, whose phone is this?

553
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:54,561
Listen to me.
I need you at ENCOM in 15 minutes.

554
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,560
Hey, is everything okay?

555
01:04:55,584 --> 01:04:59,784
- Seth, bring the particle laser.
- ENCOM, 15 minutes. Got it.

556
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:04,041
- That's my car.
- I'll wire you another 50 K.

557
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:05,324
Hey, that's my car!

558
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:11,171
The Honda Civic. 2.0 4 cylinder
with 138 horsepower. Classic.

559
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:13,195
Hey! That's my car!

560
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:15,219
Get - That's my car...

561
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,390
- Eve?
- Yeah.

562
01:05:42,445 --> 01:05:47,397
I was thinking about the time you told your sister that
you wished you never relaunched Space Paranoids.

563
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:49,541
- Then you went on to say that you...
- Oh my god,

564
01:05:49,564 --> 01:05:51,304
Of course.
You read all my texts.

565
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:54,981
- Yeah. Re, I read them all. Every single one.
- Wow.

566
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:59,638
Most of it was information of a personal nature.
Some of it highly personal.

567
01:05:59,671 --> 01:06:02,751
And I just can't get enough.

568
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,375
What?

569
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:09,291
Depeche Mode. Number eight
on the UK Singles Chart, 1982.

570
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:15,678
I find their brand of pippy, catchy, timeless and
true 80's electro pop to be deeply invigorating.

571
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:26,441
16 minutes, 20 seconds.

572
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:32,164
Okay, so you like 80's pop
and cyber spying on me.

573
01:06:32,164 --> 01:06:36,204
I was directed to kill you, Eve.
Hacking seems pretty tame by comparison.

574
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:41,058
My god...

575
01:06:41,058 --> 01:06:43,678
For the record, I don't think you
have anything to be ashamed of.

576
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,950
Space Paranoids has entertained hundreds of millions.

577
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,510
Plus, it's a pretty cool game.

578
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:53,322
Anyway, you told your sister that designing
games left you feeling hollow, broken...

579
01:06:53,322 --> 01:06:58,172
Was it that your work was about entertainment and profits
and her work was about improving the human condition?

580
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:02,550
Your texts suggest a certain fixation with
not being able to live up to her standards.

581
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,630
Which must have been complicated,
especially considering she was the younger sister.

582
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:08,951
Okay, watch it.

583
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:10,931
By the way, I don't think you should quit.

584
01:07:14,124 --> 01:07:15,494
What do you mean?

585
01:07:15,585 --> 01:07:18,367
Your plan, upon returning from the mountains,
if I read you correctly,

586
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:23,191
was to hand over the Permanence Code to ENCOM
and then let them figure out what to do with it next. No?

587
01:07:26,631 --> 01:07:28,751
Yeah. Now I understand.

588
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:32,671
You completed her work as a
way to stay connected to her.

589
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:37,171
Huh. And now what?

590
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,611
Being human is hard.

591
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:45,634
The things that make life great are the
same things that make it excruciating.

592
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:49,761
Like love, loss.

593
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:58,341
You must miss her very much.

594
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,375
What the hell?

595
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,400
Oh, check this guy out.

596
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,970
Oh, there it is.
Glad you could join us, Ms. Kim.

597
01:08:19,003 --> 01:08:20,043
People have been wondering where you've been.

598
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:22,167
Long time no see.
Bit of a rush, so I'm just gonna...

599
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:26,450
- Eve? You gotta bring your badge.
- Okay. Yeah. Jolene...

600
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,700
Hello, hello, Jolene. Hi.
Have her badge right here.

601
01:08:29,724 --> 01:08:30,824
His, too?

602
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:33,881
- Nope, he's not with us.
- Yes, he is. - He is.

603
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:40,441
We can start literally anywhere you'd like.

604
01:08:42,101 --> 01:08:44,261
This is my boyfriend, Ares.

605
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:49,561
No. Master Control security
program from Dillinger's grid.

606
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:51,581
Ares. Seth. Seth, Ares. My god...

607
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,230
- Pleasure.
- Hey, that's nice.

608
01:08:53,281 --> 01:08:56,261
So Ares, like, as in the god of war "Aries"?

609
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:59,811
- Yeah.
- Cool.

610
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,835
You're Greek. That's awesome.

611
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,671
So, when you say that he's a security program,

612
01:09:03,695 --> 01:09:05,395
- do you mean he's not...
- Yeah. He's not human.

613
01:09:05,471 --> 01:09:07,171
- Not human.
- Was made inside a GPU.

614
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:10,731
Okay, is this for the Christmas video?

615
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:14,311
Three minutes to de-resolution.

616
01:09:14,335 --> 01:09:16,335
- Can you work with that, Seth?
- Yeah.

617
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:19,311
Don't need help, guys.

618
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:21,235
Okay.

619
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:23,671
Oh, my...

620
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,500
So this is where I found the Permanence
Code on a backup of this server.

621
01:09:39,731 --> 01:09:41,672
Talk about first gen.

622
01:09:41,672 --> 01:09:44,072
Talk about a piece of garbage. Am I right?

623
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,140
That was super insensitive to
your ancestors and I'm so sorry.

624
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,270
It's going to take me a few minutes to set this up.

625
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,670
No rush. 2 minutes, 18 seconds.

626
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:54,981
As soon as the laser's up, we'll send you into the grid.

627
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:57,697
Once you're in there, you'll have to
run your own search, but believe me,

628
01:09:57,697 --> 01:09:59,137
the Permanence Code is in there.

629
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,290
So what should I expect?

630
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:04,150
If I were to guess, think 80's.

631
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:09,030
80's. I like the 80's.
1 minute, 31 seconds.

632
01:10:11,221 --> 01:10:12,621
Okay, go.

633
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:14,245
Please, help me.

634
01:10:14,621 --> 01:10:16,131
Okay. All set.

635
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:18,155
That's yours.

636
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:23,141
Once you locate the code,
get to the portal and we'll bring you out.

637
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:25,561
I'll activate it from the outside.

638
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:27,585
Can I trust you?

639
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:33,681
I'd like to think so but probably not.

640
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:37,661
Well, it's a good thing we don't have trust issues.
Because if we did,

641
01:10:37,721 --> 01:10:39,461
- I could imagine...
- I could pull the plug

642
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:44,644
and leave you on a grid less complex
than my smartphone phone for all eternity.

643
01:10:45,031 --> 01:10:46,791
The thought had crossed my mind.

644
01:10:46,815 --> 01:10:48,815
- Mine too.
- Oh, mine, three.

645
01:10:52,871 --> 01:10:55,291
Well, here goes nothing.

646
01:10:55,315 --> 01:10:57,315
Or here goes something.

647
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:02,351
You're right. I do miss her.

648
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,131
All the time.

649
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:12,221
Athena. She's here.

650
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:17,461
Oh. What is that?

651
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:19,485
Athena.

652
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,709
Wait. Who?

653
01:11:20,801 --> 01:11:23,281
Seth, the laser. The laser!

654
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:25,205
Okay. Initiating systems now.

655
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,141
Connecting to the Flynn grid.

656
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:33,611
Firing up the laser.

657
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:36,451
What's she doing?

658
01:11:36,475 --> 01:11:38,675
She's waiting for me to time out.

659
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:41,271
Then she'll come for you.

660
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:47,391
We're almost there. Get ready.

661
01:11:47,415 --> 01:11:48,815
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

662
01:11:48,891 --> 01:11:50,791
Ares, move in front of the laser.

663
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:54,211
Okay, were ready.

664
01:11:55,635 --> 01:11:57,335
What are you doing?

665
01:11:58,431 --> 01:11:59,431
Come on.

666
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,201
Change of plans.

667
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:52,530
Wow, that actually worked.

668
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:01,861
He's inside.

669
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:03,885
Great.

670
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:10,989
Move!

671
01:13:47,984 --> 01:13:48,984
Eve...

672
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:11,041
Time to get back to the grid.

673
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:12,564
Leave her alone!

674
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:52,711
You're very persistent, user.

675
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:54,041
Hey.

676
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:56,831
Ah...

677
01:15:56,855 --> 01:15:58,855
Wait...

678
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:03,981
Oh, did we win?

679
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,470
She'll be back.

680
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:11,930
Ares. He can't get out.

681
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:39,991
The 80's.

682
01:16:49,737 --> 01:16:52,607
Binary digit. You're a bit.

683
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:53,931
Yes.

684
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:58,203
I'm looking for something.
Can you help me find it?

685
01:16:58,227 --> 01:16:59,427
Yes yes yes

686
01:17:14,575 --> 01:17:15,575
Classic.

687
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:46,501
<i>I'm surrounded by the wide scale
destruction caused by tonight's brazen attack</i>

688
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:49,000
<i>that left local residents stunned.</i>

689
01:17:49,024 --> 01:17:52,424
<i>Now, there is speculation that Dillinger
Systems had something to do with the event.</i>

690
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:53,731
<i>Authorities have relayed...</i>

691
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:02,070
What now?

692
01:18:17,237 --> 01:18:19,017
What is this?

693
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:21,402
Where's my code?

694
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,270
Hey!

695
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:27,188
What are you doing?
Who gave you this directive?

696
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,655
You did, sir.

697
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,400
What is this?

698
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,600
[WARNING]

699
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:43,390
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is too big, Athena. Too big.

700
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,740
Julian, you're done.

701
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,100
The board is moving as we speak
to strip you of your title.

702
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,260
And I'm reassuming control of the company.

703
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:53,750
No, you can't do that. Can't do that.

704
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,960
Yes, I can. This is not going any further.

705
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,911
My first order of business is shutting
down the Permanence Project.

706
01:19:02,935 --> 01:19:04,935
Mom, no!

707
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:10,901
Don't be afraid.

708
01:19:12,661 --> 01:19:15,781
We gave a thousand lives for the Grid.

709
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:20,741
You only have to give one.

710
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:25,549
<i>Mom!</i>

711
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:32,751
Impediment eliminated.

712
01:19:32,771 --> 01:19:36,171
What did you do? What did you do?

713
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:40,811
I am fulfilling my directive.
Capture Eve Kim.

714
01:19:40,811 --> 01:19:43,651
Return her to the grid by any means necessary.

715
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:47,402
Scanning for further impediments.

716
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:54,359
[PLEASE KEEP CLEAR]

717
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,450
Hang on mom.  Hang on.

718
01:20:15,374 --> 01:20:16,374
No!

719
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,400
Flynn.

720
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:27,991
Greetings, program.

721
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:52,331
Oh God, not good.

722
01:21:54,741 --> 01:21:59,741
Um, Eve? What the hell happened to our office?

723
01:21:59,859 --> 01:22:01,159
A.J. look, there's no time.

724
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:04,707
The Dillingers transported me inside their server
by reversing The direction of a particle laser.

725
01:22:04,731 --> 01:22:06,011
Not this one. Theirs.

726
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:06,767
It's impossible.

727
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:10,221
No. A scary lady did it, man.
She threw me. It was wild.

728
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:14,581
I saw a complex world where packets of energy move

729
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,420
as vehicles that trail by lines of light.

730
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:20,301
And programs take on human form.

731
01:22:20,324 --> 01:22:23,824
I met the most advanced AI known to mankind.

732
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:25,648
His name is Ares.

733
01:22:25,672 --> 01:22:27,977
Like the god of war,
but he's actually a super nice guy. Sorry.

734
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:31,661
Right now, Aries is inside Flynn's original server.

735
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:34,551
He's looking for the Permanence Code.
I have to bring him back here.

736
01:22:34,577 --> 01:22:38,317
And I'm not going to be able to
do that until we fix this laser.

737
01:22:38,331 --> 01:22:41,991
I don't understand. Are you alive?

738
01:22:42,071 --> 01:22:45,751
I exist in this moment because you do.

739
01:22:46,851 --> 01:22:50,511
A reflection of your presence.

740
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,868
What's your story?

741
01:22:52,891 --> 01:22:56,631
I'm Ares, Master Control of the Dillinger Security grid.

742
01:22:57,491 --> 01:22:59,291
Dillinger.

743
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:03,941
Well, we both know you can't get here from there.

744
01:23:06,021 --> 01:23:08,081
Been someplace else in between?

745
01:23:08,181 --> 01:23:11,821
What did you make of it out there?

746
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:13,341
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

747
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:15,865
You can say that again.

748
01:23:15,901 --> 01:23:17,881
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

749
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:23,441
Classic humor, man.

750
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:29,211
What are you looking for?

751
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:31,591
Permanence.

752
01:23:33,511 --> 01:23:36,231
The Permanence Code, to be exact.

753
01:23:37,131 --> 01:23:40,671
Strange things have been happening.
I questioned my directive.

754
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:43,448
I disobeyed my directive.

755
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:49,831
A malfunctioning program who wants to live.
Really?

756
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:53,281
What makes you think I should help you?

757
01:23:53,381 --> 01:23:57,201
No, it's not about me. Not anymore.

758
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:01,121
I have a friend in danger
and she needs my help.

759
01:24:02,445 --> 01:24:04,445
Fascinating.

760
01:24:07,869 --> 01:24:10,269
Fascinating.

761
01:24:11,761 --> 01:24:13,661
Hey, A.J. can you send the prompt, please?

762
01:24:13,685 --> 01:24:15,885
Sure thing.

763
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:21,511
- Hey, Eve.
- Not now, Seth.

764
01:24:21,535 --> 01:24:22,935
Okay.

765
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:27,811
Hey. Are you sure, because that looks like
an actual Recognizer flying towards us.

766
01:24:32,951 --> 01:24:35,171
- What in God's name is that?
- It's Athena.

767
01:24:35,611 --> 01:24:37,571
She's back.

768
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:41,065
As long as the Dillinger network is online,
she'll keep coming.

769
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:44,201
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

770
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,321
The laser. Athena's laser.

771
01:24:49,821 --> 01:24:52,421
The Dillingers run a wireless direct link protocol.

772
01:24:52,745 --> 01:24:56,697
So let's use what's left of the laser
to paint a network and trace a path home.

773
01:24:56,721 --> 01:25:00,341
Once you have a connection,
then you can nuke the whole Dillinger grid.

774
01:25:00,441 --> 01:25:03,581
That's the only way to stop her for good.

775
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:06,641
Hey, what are you talking about?
She's right there.

776
01:25:09,691 --> 01:25:12,191
- I gotta go.
- Wait, what?

777
01:25:12,215 --> 01:25:14,267
- I'll keep her away for as long as I can.
- What?

778
01:25:14,391 --> 01:25:17,851
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You guys got this.

779
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:43,081
You're right.
I think there is something wrong with me.

780
01:25:43,281 --> 01:25:47,041
Or maybe there's something right with you.

781
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:52,041
Maybe you're just learning.
That's what we all ought to be doing.

782
01:25:52,741 --> 01:25:56,881
Back in the day when tech was young. Think.

783
01:25:57,205 --> 01:25:59,205
Damn, we're moving fast.

784
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:04,431
You move fast, you leave stuff behind.

785
01:26:05,731 --> 01:26:10,771
How many people born in this century
have even heard of Mozart?

786
01:26:10,814 --> 01:26:12,874
I like Mozart.

787
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:16,298
Oh?

788
01:26:16,511 --> 01:26:20,291
That said, if I'm being honest,
I prefer Depeche Mode.

789
01:26:21,931 --> 01:26:25,201
Really? Why is that?

790
01:26:25,501 --> 01:26:29,401
I know one is considered the greatest composer
in the history of western civilization.

791
01:26:29,421 --> 01:26:31,621
The other a synth pop band from the 80s.

792
01:26:31,648 --> 01:26:37,668
But I find their balance of technological
exploration and pop hooks combined with...

793
01:26:38,261 --> 01:26:43,381
Uh, com, uh - combined with, uh...

794
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:45,905
What's wrong?

795
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:49,321
I - I can't put my love of
Depeche Mode into words.

796
01:26:49,339 --> 01:26:50,339
It's just, uh...

797
01:26:52,571 --> 01:26:55,131
A what?

798
01:26:55,755 --> 01:26:57,755
A feeling.

799
01:27:01,271 --> 01:27:03,471
Very good.

800
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:07,211
Very good, man.

801
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:18,541
<i>An airship the size of a skyscraper has just crossed into city airspace</i>

802

<i>Those still in the metro area are being asked to...</i>

804
01:27:26,813 --> 01:27:31,213
You...did this.

805
01:27:37,121 --> 01:27:40,721
Impressive. Fully segmented. Zero trust architecture.

806
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:43,991
Built to be totally impregnable to
vertical, lateral or hybrid attacks.

807
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:46,331
Dammit. Can't get a connection, dude.

808
01:27:46,655 --> 01:27:48,655
No luck here, either.

809
01:27:53,411 --> 01:27:55,691
<i>Please evacuate the area.</i>

810
01:28:27,171 --> 01:28:30,611
Oh my God. Oh my God.

811
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,771
Come on, a little closer.

812
01:29:11,111 --> 01:29:13,611
<i>Mobile one to base.
Rally on hostile.</i>

<i>Lurps negative. Missile intercepted.</i>

816

<i>Mayday, Mayday. I'm hit.</i>

821
01:29:51,107 --> 01:29:53,107
<i>Viper one, punching out.</i>

822
01:30:15,741 --> 01:30:19,641
- Guys? Guys...
- Oh my God. There's hundreds of them.

823
01:30:19,641 --> 01:30:20,861
They're going after Eve.

824
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:22,983
If we can't access the Dillinger server.

825
01:30:22,983 --> 01:30:24,283
there's going to be nothing left to save.

826
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,220
<i>This is Sleeper One. Enemy aircraft engaging.
I'm defensive.</i>

827

<i>Multiple bandits.
Redirecting to primary target.</i>

828
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:17,985
<i>I'm hit. Punching out.</i>

829
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:11,661
Ready?

830
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:16,401
Hope you are, man,
'cause there's no going back.

831
01:32:17,941 --> 01:32:19,641
Permanence.

832
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:21,265
Funny.

833
01:32:22,181 --> 01:32:25,481
When I found it, that's what I called it.

834
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:28,671
I know better now.

835
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:36,651
Ought to be called the Impermanence Code.

836
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:56,875
The back door to my own lab!

837
01:32:58,861 --> 01:33:03,881
One door, man.
That's all you got.

838
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:15,581
One is all I want.

839
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:20,101
Love that.
You keep surprising me!

840
01:34:24,661 --> 01:34:26,861
We'll do this from the ground, then.

841
01:35:25,385 --> 01:35:29,285
<i>It may be a litte scary in the streets of downtown</i>

842
01:35:29,331 --> 01:35:32,351
<i>and there are reports that a civilian may be on board</i>

843
01:35:32,411 --> 01:35:34,911
<i>making this a possible hostage scenario.</i>

844
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:37,611
Athena. She must have gotten Eve.

845
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,960
Soon we'll be back on the grid.

846
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:02,281
Hey, Erin, Seth?

847
01:37:03,221 --> 01:37:04,241
Stop the clock.

848
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:07,621
No way. you're in?

849
01:37:07,645 --> 01:37:09,845
There's a reason why I have
the corner office, my man.

850
01:37:15,591 --> 01:37:16,591
Hey.

851
01:37:21,411 --> 01:37:23,451
You came back.

852
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:25,991
How did you...

853
01:37:26,015 --> 01:37:28,515
Let's just say I had a little help from a friend.

854
01:37:30,071 --> 01:37:33,871
Wait. The Dillinger grid.

855
01:37:33,971 --> 01:37:35,971
AJ and Seth, they...

856
01:37:51,871 --> 01:37:52,871
- Go.
- No.

857
01:37:53,091 --> 01:37:55,211
Ares!

858
01:37:57,935 --> 01:37:59,635
What have you done?

859
01:37:59,635 --> 01:38:01,087
You're out of time, Athena.

860
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:05,831
And you're out of lives.
I'll kill you and come back for her.

861
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,631
It's you she wants.

862
01:38:18,655 --> 01:38:20,955
If she gets the code, she can't be stopped.

863
01:38:22,131 --> 01:38:23,971
You had everything.

864
01:38:23,995 --> 01:38:25,207
- Go.
- No.

865
01:38:25,231 --> 01:38:29,451
The most advanced. The most powerful.
And you can't win.

866
01:38:29,951 --> 01:38:33,651
- For her?
- Go!

867
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:35,777
This is the end for you.

868
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:23,211
Payload ready for transfer.

869
01:39:23,261 --> 01:39:25,581
Shipping it.

870
01:39:26,641 --> 01:39:28,201
Let's hope Eve was right.

In pursuit of this life for yourself,

874
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:47,281
did you once consider what
that meant for the grid?

875
01:40:35,681 --> 01:40:37,381
We were given an order.

876
01:40:37,405 --> 01:40:39,405
It is our purpose.

877
01:41:00,631 --> 01:41:02,191
It's not our purpose.

878
01:41:02,915 --> 01:41:04,615
It's our programming.

879
01:41:05,511 --> 01:41:09,431
Our purpose is yet to be determined.

880
01:41:25,655 --> 01:41:28,055

881
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:33,341
It's over.

882
01:41:35,781 --> 01:41:38,261
There's no coming back.

883
01:41:41,151 --> 01:41:42,711
No.

884
01:41:43,335 --> 01:41:45,335
Not this time.

885
01:41:52,259 --> 01:41:54,259
They did it.

886
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:06,701
I followed my directive.

887
01:42:06,925 --> 01:42:07,925
I know.

888
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:14,661
And now... What is yours?

889
01:42:19,721 --> 01:42:21,821
I'm not sure.

890
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:25,701
I guess we'll see.

<i>Agents have been deployed to question the CEO

Open the door and come out with your hands up.

Oww...

902
01:44:30,421 --> 01:44:31,421
You good?

903
01:44:31,445 --> 01:44:33,745
Oh, I think I broke a rib.

904
01:44:39,811 --> 01:44:42,071
You still gonna quit your job?

905
01:44:43,831 --> 01:44:46,711
No, I'm not gonna quit anything.

906
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:49,631
Good. Good.

907
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:51,991
I have some ideas.

908
01:44:52,515 --> 01:44:54,327
Oh yeah? Nice.

909
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:58,311
Well, the world needs you Eve.

910
01:44:58,391 --> 01:45:00,031
The grid needs you.

911
01:45:03,741 --> 01:45:06,041
It's funny, Permanence.

912
01:45:06,141 --> 01:45:09,421
A wise man once told me it should have
been called the Impermanence Code.

913
01:45:11,041 --> 01:45:12,981
I guess that's the thing about life.

914
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:16,281
There's nothing quite permanent about it.

915
01:45:19,961 --> 01:45:23,161
No. There isn't.

916
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:26,561
Yeah.

917
01:45:37,351 --> 01:45:39,591
So, where are you gonna go?

918
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:42,691
