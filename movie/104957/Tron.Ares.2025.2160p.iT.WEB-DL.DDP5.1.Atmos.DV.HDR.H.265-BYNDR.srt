00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,860
他全是自有技术，而且随时能牺牲
He is fully proprietary and 100% expendable.

144
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,780
战神是终极士兵
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

145
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,650
不需要食物饮水，不会流血
He needs no food, no water, sheds no blood.

146
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,490
如果出现奇迹，他在战场上倒下
And if, by some miracle, he is struck down on the battlefield,

147
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,360
我就再做一个给你
I will simply make you another.

148
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,400
（声震波）

149
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,950
程式码那么精密
With all that sophisticated code,

150
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,900
你怎么控制得了它？
what makes you think you can contain it?

151
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,780
我向你担保，将军
I can assure you, General,

152
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,610
最先进的失效安全机制
the most advanced fail-safe mechanisms

153
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,280
与限制协定都已就位
and restriction protocols are in place.

154
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,360
战神可测可控，完全服从
Ares is predictable, controllable and fully aligned.

155
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,200
伴随等熵抬升的南方锋面，转为气旋
Southerly front with isentropic lift, turning cyclonic.

156
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,820
预计降雨66毫米
Predicted precipitation, 2.6 inches.

157
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,990
希望你们带了伞
I hope that you brought your umbrellas.

158
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,030
我必须恭喜你，朱利安
I have to hand it to you, Julian.

159
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,240
你承诺会大获全胜
You promised a big win

160
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,860
这比我们想像中更了不起
and this is even bigger than any of us could've imagined.

161
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,820
谢谢
Thank you.

162
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,740
我祖父创立狄林杰公司时
My grandfather started Dillinger Corporation

163
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,530
根本没人听过“网路安全”
long before anybody heard the term "cybersecurity."

164
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,860
军事AI是未来趋势
Military AI is the future.

165
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,490
问题不在是否该制造汽车，汽车…
The question is not whether the car should be built. The car is...

166
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,860
正在制造中
being built right now.

167
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,610
问题是…
The question is...

168
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,240
谁握有钥匙？
who's holding the keys?

169
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,450
好炫的小把戏
That was quite some parlor trick.

170
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,860
时间？ -44秒
-Time? -Forty-four seconds.

171
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,450
“希望你们带了伞”
"I hope you brought your umbrellas."

172
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,650
那在剧本里，还是他即兴演出？
Was that in the script, or was he just having a moment?

173
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,900
伊莉莎白狄林杰
Elisabeth Dillinger,

174
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,820
已故创办人爱德华狄林杰的长女
eldest daughter of founder Edward Dillinger, deceased.

175
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,280
在公司历史上平淡无奇的时期
Longtime CEO during a relatively unremarkable period

176
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,530
长期担任执行长，随后被独子取代
of corporate history before being superseded by your only son.

177
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,490
幸会
It's a pleasure.

178
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,570
平淡无奇？
Unremarkable?

179
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,450
我任期的市占率提升12%，几乎…
Market share was up 12% during my tenure. That's hardly...

180
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,280
总之我们不说“取代”，我们…
And anyway, we don't say "superseded," we...

181
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,320
称为“生孩子”
we call it "giving birth."

182
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
当然
Of course.

183
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,360
很荣幸见到我创造者的创造者
It's an honor to meet my creator's creator.

184
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,030
又来了
Oh, here we go.

185
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,740
我发现你没有提到
I noticed you left out the part

186
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,280
你似乎无法让这家伙活著
where you can't seem to keep this thing of yours alive

187
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,570
超过25分钟 -29分钟
-for more than 25 minutes. -Twenty-nine.

188
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,360
朱利安，欺骗投资人不算商业模式
Deceiving your investors, Julian, is hardly a business model.

189
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,570
掌控恒久程式码的人就能掌握未来
Whoever controls the Permanence Code, controls the future.

190
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,150
我们非赢不可
We have to win.

191
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,360
听著，我…
Look, I...

192
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,360
欣赏你的远见，站挺
admire your vision. Straighten up.

193
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,400
不过董事会只会再支持你半年
However, the board will only stand behind you for another six months...

194
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,860
如果你运气好的话
if you're lucky.

195
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,610
要是不成功
But if it doesn't work...

196
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,860
这一切都会化为乌有，宝贝
all of this goes away, darling.

197
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,610
我们过去40年来打造的所有心血
Everything we have built for the past 40 years.

198
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,490
要是我说我找到方法了呢？
What if I said I had found a way?

199
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,530
（凯文费林，伺服器备份）

200
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,240
这是我第95个早餐墨西哥卷
I think this is my 95th breakfast burrito,

201
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,320
真的吃不腻，很扯吧？
and, honestly, can't get enough. Isn't that wild?

202
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,860
好吧…
Well...

203
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,650
还好家里不是只有黛丝执迷不悟
Nice to see Tess wasn't the only obsessive one in the family.

204
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,150
赛斯，你说得对
Yeah, Seth, you're right.

205
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,490
抱歉，我该更关注你…没关系
Sorry, I should pay more attention to you. Don't worry about it.

206
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,240
（输入档名）

207
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
好
Okay.

208
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,900
对不起啦 -少来
-I'm sorry. -Get out of here.

209
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,700
在气温零下的地方待三个月很久，我懂
Look, three months in subzero is a long time, I get it.

210
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,070
又4天10小时32分
Yeah, and four days, ten hours, 32 minutes.

211
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,450
谁在算呢？
Who's counting, really, you know?

212
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
等一下
Hold on.

213
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,240
什么意思？
What do you mean?

214
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
怎样？
What?

215
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,780
（列印？检查完成？）

216
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,450
（恭喜）

217
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
赛斯
Seth.

218
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,320
发现什么了吗？ -应该是
-You found something? -I think so.

219
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,650
那行程式码
The line of code.

220
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,900
那就是他的藏法，有两行
That's how he hid it, it's two lines.

221
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,990
好像双螺旋
That looks like a double helix.

222
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,990
它就是双螺旋
It is a double helix.

223
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,780
黛丝一定会很开心
Tess would've loved this.

224
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,570
你认真？不会再“29分钟挂点”？
Wait. Are you serious? So no more "29 minutes and out"?

225
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,780
如果跟我想的一样
If this is what I think it is,

226
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,360
它就是恒久程式码
it's the Permanence Code.

227
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,360
（录影中）

228
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,200
好
Okay.

229
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,240
英克尔离线测试317a-1
Encom offline trial 317a-1. Permanence Code implemented.

230
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,740
执行恒久程式码
Testing for asset stability beyond current 29-minute barrier.

231
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,320
测试资产稳定性能否突破目前29分的限制

232
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,450
开始
Go.

233
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,530
准备好就开始 -好
-Ready when you are. -Okay.

234
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,070
（转移开始）

235
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,900
关键就在技巧
It's all in the wrists, baby.

236
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,240
百看不厌
That never gets old.

237
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,070
测试开始，29分倒数计时
Trial commenced. Twenty-nine minutes and counting down.

238
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,200
看这次能不能撑下去
Let's see if you last this time.

239
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,570
战神是终极士兵
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

240
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,030
如果出现奇迹，他在战场上倒下
If by some miracle he is struck down on the battlefield,

241
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,950
我就再做一个给你
I will simply make you another.

242
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,650
全是自有技术，而且随时…
Fully proprietary, 100%...

243
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,400
能牺牲
expendable.

244
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,700
雅典娜 -欢迎回来，长官
-Athena. -Welcome back, sir.

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,070
各单位已上线，可供检查
All units are online and ready for inspection.

246
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,280
行程顺利吗？
So how was it?

247
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,200
很有趣，这次不一样
It was interesting. Different this time.

248
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,950
我见到一对母子
I met a mother and a son.

249
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,400
当时在下雨
It was raining.

大气中凝结的水分，以水滴状落下的现象
The condensed moisture of the atmosphere falling visibly in separate drops.

251
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,650
我几乎能感受到
I could almost feel it.

252
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,240
感受？我不懂
Feel? I don't understand.

253
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,530

我是伊芙，冷静下来，传讯息
This is Eve. Get sensible and text.

255

伊芙，我是艾琳，亚杰找你，请回电
Hey, Eve. It's Erin. Got Ajay for you again. Hit us back.

256
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,360

259
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,700
可恶，伊芙，你在哪？
Goddamn it. Where the hell are you, Eve?

我跟几个董事会成员谈过
Well, I spoke to several of our board members,

271
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,570
他们当然大为惊艳
and needless to say they are impressed.

你骇进英克尔？
You're hacking Encom?

277
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,610
只是瞄一眼，没人会注意
Just a peek over the garden wall. No one will notice.

278
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,860
你怎么会认为英克尔快找到了？
What makes you think that Encom is any closer to finding it?

279
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,240
因为我知道还有谁在找它
Because I know who else is looking for it, all right?

280
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,450
谁？
Who?

281
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
伊芙金
Eve Kim.

282
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,780
她追随她妹的脚步
She's following in her sister's footsteps.

283
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,070
她想找恒久程式码，我感觉得到
She's after the Permanence Code. I can feel it.

284
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,150
我要找到她，到时候…
So I'm gonna find her, and when I do...

285
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,570
我觉得不妥，太冒险了，朱利安
No, I don't like it. It's too risky, Julian.

286
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
糟糕
Oops.

287
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,780

Put your hands together for Encom CTO, Ajay Singh!

296

牛仔上场 -不
-It's cowboy time. -Oh, no.

297
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,820
大家好
Nice to see you!

298
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,900

谢谢
Thank you.

300
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,820
你好吗，疯空博览会？
What's up, Paranoia-Con?

301
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,780
我要进去了
I'm going in.

302
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,400
（获准进入英克尔）

303

我进去了
I'm in.

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,200
我是天才，谁晓得你养了一个天才？
I'm a genius! Who knew you raised a genius, Mother?

305
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,860
我进去了
I'm in!

306
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,530
惹祸上身
In deep shit.

307
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,030
（山姆费林的神秘女郎是谁？）

308
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,530
启动封锁程序，切断网络存取

我们得立刻应对
We need a response now.

310
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,490
启动安全程序
Initiate security protocol.

311
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,280
人们将生活托付给人工智慧
People are trusting artificial intelligence with their lives.

312
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,990
你感到安心吗？
Are you comfortable with this?

313
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,280
听著
Well, look.

314
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,700
每个末日情境
For every doomsday scenario,

315
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,110
都有医疗突破和科学发现
there's a medical breakthrough, scientific discovery.

316
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,900
或许未知带来的事物没那么可怕
So maybe what emerges from the unknown isn't so scary.

317
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,650
如果它的重大缺陷只是仁慈呢？
What if its major malfunction is just benevolence?

318
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,900
这是什么？他在干嘛？
What is this? What's he doing?

319
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,700
不过，你偏好跟真人对话吗？
But still, would you prefer to talk to a real person?

320
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,610
当然，但要是那个人已经联络不上了呢？
Of course, but what if that person is no longer in your life?

321
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,700
不在人世了呢？
No longer here?

322
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,820
拿到档案了
I've got the file.

323
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,110

324
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
恭喜
Congratulations.

325
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,200
趁机快离开吧
Now get out of there while you still can.

326
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,990
程式们，开战
Programs, we fight.

327
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,070
对！
Yes!

328
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,150
感谢大家
Thank you so much.

329
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,360
疯空粉都怎么做？
What do Paranoiacs do?

330
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,570
彻底碾压你
Grind you into dust!

331

凯厄斯
Caius.

332
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,820
他失能了，别管他
He's dysfunctional. Leave him.

333
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,360
你撑得住，凯厄斯
You're gonna make it, Caius.

334
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,610
有时得牺牲骑士才能逮到对方的皇后
Sometimes you have to sacrifice your knight to expose their queen.

335
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,530

339
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,740
怎么了？ -那是什么？
-What's up, bro? -What is that?

340
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,990
太扯了 -你看到了吗？
-This is crazy. -Have you seen this?

341
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,950
辛先生，你得跟我来
Mr. Singh, you need to come with me.

342
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,490
这是技术问题
This is a technical difficulty.

343
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,700
马上回来 -这边请
-We'll be back. -This way, sir.

344
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,070
全都挂了
Everything's gone down.

345
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,860
很好，主控
Well done, Master Control.

346
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,990
已取得伊芙金的档案
Eve Kim's file acquired.

347

目标达成
Objective achieved.

348
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,530
长官，我想知道凯厄斯程式为何没重建
Sir, I'm curious why the Program Caius was not reconstituted.

349
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,740
我想知道你为何想知道
I'm curious why you are curious.

350
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,240
凯厄斯失能，所以被删除了
Caius was dysfunctional, so he was deleted.

351
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,360
跟任何不照指令运作的程式一样
Just like any program that operates outside their directive can be.

352
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,700
你懂吗？
Do you understand?

353
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,360
回答我，主控
Acknowledge, Master Control.

354
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,150
当然
Of course.

355
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,900
我们是随时可以牺牲的
We are 100% expendable.

356
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,200
新任务，主控，找到伊芙金
New mission, Master Control. Locate Eve Kim.

357
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
是
Yes, sir.

358
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,700
我们好像碰上小型网路攻击，小朱
Seems like we had a little cyber breach, Jules.

359
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,780
但你当然知道了
But then of course you knew that.

360
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,530
看来全世界都知道
It looks like the whole world knows, buddy.

361
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,030
最好远离社群媒体几天
Might wanna stay off the socials for a few days.

362
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,110
你想跟我玩？那就来玩
You wanna play games with me? Let's play games, Julian.

363
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,700
我听说你向董事会提的案子了
I heard about your cute little pitch to the board.

364
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,240
但你漏了一个关键细节
But you left off one key detail from your deck.

365
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,400
你有说进攻时间只有29分钟吗？
Did you tell them the shot clock expires at 29 minutes?

366
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,610
别逼我向报社爆料
Don't make me call The Journal and tell them

367
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,240
你的承诺无法实现
you're making promises you can't keep.

368
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,450
承诺？
Promises?

369
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,570
就像你们说执行长会在办公室坐镇吗？
What, you mean like the one that your CEO will be in office running the company?

370
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,450
事有蹊跷吧，亚杰？
Something in the water over there, Ajay?

371
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,950
先是山姆费林，现在是他的继位者
I mean, first, wonder boy Sam Flynn, now his successor.

372
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,860
她在哪，亚杰？你知道吗？
Where is she, Ajay? Do you even know where she is?

373
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,200
也许你说得对
Maybe you're right.

374
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,700
也许伊芙疯了
Maybe Eve went nuts.

375
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,030
也许她擅离职守出国，也许…
Maybe she went AWOL and left the country, or maybe...

376
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,530
她是躲起来，跟你找同样的东西
she's holed up off the grid looking for the same thing you are.

377
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,900
我知道我会赌谁赢
And I know who my money's on.

378
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,780
如果你今晚过后还有钱
You mean what's left of it after tonight.

379
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,150
通话结束
End of line!

380
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,610
我讨厌那个人
I hate that man.

381
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,200
非常谢谢你
Thank you so much.

382
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,700
那些柳橙是我做的，说来话长
You know, I made those oranges. It's a long story.

383
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,700
停…
Stop, stop, stop.

384
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,950
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

385
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,700
1913则讯息，好红喔 -哇
-1913 messages. Popular. -Wow.

386
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,820
（亚杰辛）

387
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,400
是亚杰，找你的
-Me? -It's Ajay. Yeah, that's you.

388
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,780
亚杰，你在那里吗？ -我在吗？
-Ajay, are you there? -Am I here?

389
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,740
我们的伺服器被暴力破解
A brute force attack took down our servers

390
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,280
就在重大产品发表会上
during our biggest product launch in years.

391
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,570
我们建立的一切都垮了，你得马上回来
Everything we've built is melting down. You need to get back here right now.

392
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,150
我找到了，亚杰，是真的
I found it, Ajay. It's real.

393
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,990
就在黛丝认定的地方，一直都在费林手上
Right where Tess thought it would be. Flynn had it all along.

394
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,360
你是说恒久程式码？
Are you talking about the Permanence Code?

395
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,700
对，已经超过四小时了
Yeah. Four hours and counting.

396
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,070
没有退化，没有不稳，状态极佳
Zero degradation, no instability. It's incredible.

397
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,240
等等，你说四小时？
Wait a second. Did you say four hours?

398
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,030
对，四小时 -天啊
-Yeah, four hours. -My God.

399
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,200
他一定知道，伊芙
He must know, Evie.

400
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,530
我跟刚狄林杰谈过
-I just spoke to Dillinger.

401
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,110
等等，你跟狄林杰谈过？
-Wait. You just spoke to Dillinger?

402
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,070
他在找程式码，他认为你也是
He's looking for the code, and he thinks you are too.

403
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,700
我们得赶紧行动
We gotta move on this.

404
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,150
伊芙，你表现得太好了
-Eve, you've done a great thing.

405
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,650
是黛丝的功劳
-Tess did a great thing.

406
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,990
我正要去英克尔
I'm en route to Encom.

407
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,530
我们会保住程式码，我存在随身碟里
We'll secure the code, I have it with me on a drive.

408
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,490
（存取资料库中）

409
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,280
我们要重新推出《疯狂空间》
We're relaunching Paranoia!

410
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,030
今天你生日…
Boy, it's your birthday. Boy, it's your birthday.

411
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,490
亚杰 -今天你生日
-Yeah! Ajay. -Boy, it's your birthday.

412
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,900
（伊芙金）
Yo, what's up, Eve? You've got some news for the freaks at home?

413
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,530
你好吗，伊芙？有消息要告诉粉丝吗？

414
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,610
（科学怪人）

415
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,740
嗨

Hi.

416
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,530
“我无所畏惧，因而强大”
"I am fearless, and therefore powerful."

417
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,990
看来我们刚卖出第一千万套
So, apparently we just sold our ten millionth unit!

567
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,360
撷取程式码，删除载体
Extract the code and delete the carrier.

568
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,650
可是，撷取恒久程式码
But, sir, extracting the Permanence Code

569
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,110
会将载体从创界网络和您的世界删除
would delete the carrier from the Grid and from your world.

570
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,110
（执行这项命令）

571
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,240
（将无法复原）

572
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,030
很久以前，有一种武器叫战神
Once upon a time, there was a weapon and its name was Ares.

573
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:35,900
战神对朱利安狄林杰言听计从
And Ares obeyed every command of Julian Dillinger,

574
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,570
朱利安狄林杰赚进一兆元
and Julian Dillinger made a trillion dollars.

575
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:42,650
还用鲜血让他在历史上留名
And wrote his name on the face of time in blood.

576
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,950
无论这些感受来自什么操作错误
Now, whatever PEBKAC error is behind these feelings,

577
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:49,280
我都会找到它，把它从你身上剔除
I'm going to find it and rip it out of you.

578
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,450
我说得清楚吗？
Do I make myself clear?

579
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,570
十分清楚
Perfectly.

580
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,740
程式退下
Program dismissed.

581
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,070
那个怪物也说：“我无所畏惧
The creature also said, "I am fearless,

582
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,570
因而强大”
and therefore powerful."

583
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,820
如何？ -使用者身体不适
-Well? -The user is indisposed.

584
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,530
静候指令再撷取
Hold extraction until further directive.

585
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,950
身体不适？ -是的
-Indisposed? -Correct.

586
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,900
说明何谓身体不适
Define indisposed.

587
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,650
他困在车阵中
He's stuck in traffic.

588
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,240
不，他在歌剧院
No, he's at the opera.

589
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,070
他穿著绿色袜子站在富士山顶
He's standing on the top of Mount Fuji in a pair of green socks

590
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,150
用曼陀林演奏《带手枪的妈妈》
playing "Pistol Packin' Mama" on the mandolin.

591
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,030
我已经下达命令
I gave you an order.

592
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,900
创造者身体不适
The creator's indisposed.

593
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,360
等我们收到进一步指令再撷取
Hold extraction until we receive further directive.

594
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,400
我说得清楚吗？
Do I make myself clear?

595
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
清楚，长官
Yes, sir.

596
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,610
程式们退下
Programs dismissed.

597
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,030
我能信任你吗？
Can I trust you?

598
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,030
这问题很复杂，你有多少时间？
It's a complicated question. How much time you got?

599
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,700
60秒，快回答，你的生命周期就靠它了
Sixty seconds. Answer now. Your life cycle depends upon it.

600
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,650
我没有生命周期
I don't have a life cycle.

601
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,450
你有，还剩下54秒
Yes, you do. For another 54 seconds.

602
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,030
我可以信任你吗？
Can I trust you?

603
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,950
我希望可以，但应该不行
I'd like to think so, but probably not.

604
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,200
（雅典娜，来讯）

605
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,450
主控在哪里？
Where is Master Control?

606
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,740
长官，主控出现故障迹象
Sir, Master Control is exhibiting signs of malfunction.

607
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,820
指令受到的威胁都必须铲除
Any threat to the directive must be eliminated.

608
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,360
撷取程式码，把他们两个都删除
Extract the code and delete them both.

609
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,950
你懂吗？
Do you understand?

610
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,070
朱利安狄林杰呢？ -不能信任他
-And Julian Dillinger? -You can't trust him.

611
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,240
他认为所有人事物都可以牺牲
For him, everyone and everything is expendable.

612
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,490
我失算了
I miscalculated.

613
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,950
我们有新指令
We have a new directive.

614
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,200
雅典娜，没必要这样
Athena, it doesn't have to be like this.

615
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,320
删除他
Delete him!

616
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,240
我没事…
I'm okay. I'm okay.

617
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,860
他们要前往转移入口
They're headed towards the Transfer Portal.

618
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,400
他们躲进创界网络了
We lost them in the Grid, ma'am.

619
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,740
准备无人机
Preparing the drones.

620
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,740
删除战神
Delete Ares,

621
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,150
带使用者回来 -收到
-and bring the user back to me. -Copy.

622
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:36,990
（无人机储备库）

623
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,150
刚才发生什么事？
What happened back there?

624
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,070
我违抗指令
I disobeyed my directive.

625
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,450
什么指令？
Which was?

626
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,700
从你的光碟取回程式码，删除载体
To retrieve the code from your disk and delete the carrier.

627
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,900
狄林杰叫你删除我？
Dillinger told you to delete me?

628
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
抓紧
Hang on!

629
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,740
他们在哪里？
Where are they?

630
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,450
扫描第三与第四象限
Scanning quadrants three and four.

631
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,030
18区没有发现
Sector 18 clear.

632
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,740
我们要去哪？
Where are we going?

633
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,820
转移入口，离开创界网络的唯一途径
Transfer Portal. It's the only way out of the Grid.

634
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
你会在真实世界重建
You'll be reconstituted in the real world

635
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,450
理论上会跟以前完全一样
exactly as you were before, hypothetically.

636
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,400
理论上？ -应该吧
-Hypothetically? -Probably.

637
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,110
72区有动静
We have movement in sector 72.

638
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,030
瞄准目标
Zeroing in on target.

639
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,530
射击他们
Shut them down!

640
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,070
你想回家，我能帮你
You wanna get home, I can help you.

641
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,610
但我需要一点回报
But I need something in return.

642
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,240
我说过我没有程式码
I told you I don't have the code.

643
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,240
你找到它一次，就能再找到第二次
You found it once, you can find it again.

644
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,950
你要交给狄林杰？
So you can give it to Dillinger?

645
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,200
不是给狄林杰
Not for Dillinger.

646
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,860
是给我
For me.

647
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,030
就这样说定了？
Do we have a deal?

648
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,650
我们说定了吗？
So, do we have a deal?

649
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,990
对，我知道去哪找程式码，快带我离开
Yes. Yes, I know where to find the code. Just get me out of here.

650
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,200
目标45秒后接近转移入口
Target approaching Transfer Portal in 45 seconds.

651
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:42,900
（离线）
Drones malfunctioned and offline.

652
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:45,030
无人机故障、离线

653
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,610
注意
Attention.

654
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,650
（转移开始）
Please stand clear.

655
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,780
请保持距离

656
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,110
覆写指令无回应
Override not responding.

657
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,030
怎么了？ -谁授权的？
-What is it? -Who authorized this?

658
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,110
（转移开始）

659
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,530
这源自创界网络内部
Sir, this originated inside the Grid.

660
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:28,610
安全程序警报
Security protocol alert.

661
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,700
朱利安？
Julian?

662
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,740
全体探员立刻向转移层报到
All the agents report to transfer bay floor immediately.

转移完成 -过去
-Transfer complete. -Move in.

667
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,700
（战神）

668
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,860
唉呀呀
Well, well, well.

669
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,990
我被我的程式背叛了
Just got double-crossed by my program.

670
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,280
它自己想要恒久程式码
It wants the Permanence Code for itself.

671
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,150
伊芙，你们讲好了？
Eve, is that the deal?

672
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,320
它带你离开创界网络
It gets you out of the Grid,

673
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,110
你把小木偶变成小男孩？
you turn Pinocchio into a real boy?

674
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,150
你漏掉你为了一个软体
Well, you're missing the part where you were willing to commit murder

675
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,360
不惜杀人的部分
for a piece of software.

676
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,110
是它说的吗？ -28分41秒
-Is that what it said? -Twenty-eight minutes, 41 seconds.

677
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,780
战神
Ares!

678
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,490
我希望你们心想事成
I do hope this works out for you.

679
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,780
没有第二次机会，无法重来
There's no second chances, no do-overs.

680
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,530
这是你拥有的最后29分钟
These are the last 29 minutes you'll ever have!

681
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,320
最好善加利用
Better make it count!

682
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,280
（沙迪克）

683
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,530
我真该主修英文的
I should've majored in English lit.

684
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,820
（战神，雅典娜）

685
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,860
转移完成
Transfer complete.

686
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,740
你要找到伊芙金
Your directive is to find Eve Kim,

687
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,400
送她回创界网络，把恒久程式码交给我
return her to the Grid and get me the Permanence Code.

688
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,200
不择手段
By any means necessary.

689
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,150
你了解你的指令吗？
Do you understand your directive,

690
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,610
主控
Master Control?

691
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,110
遵命，长官
At your command, sir.

692
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:49,780
乖女孩
Attagirl.

693
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,030
时间有限
Ticktock!

694
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,150
那是我见过最酷的东西
Now that is the coolest thing I have ever seen.

695
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,740
知道凯文费林是谁吗？
Do you know who Kevin Flynn was?

696
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,400
当然，前卫程式设计师
Of course. Visionary programmer,

697
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:45,900
数位新领域的先驱
pioneer of The Digital Frontier.

698
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,700
1989年失踪
Disappeared 1989.

699
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,280
我在费林伺服器的备份中发现恒久程式码
I found the Permanence Code on a backup of Flynn's server.

700
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,780
那个伺服器在英克尔的市区办公室
That server is at Encom's office downtown. But we can make it within...

701
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,610
我们能在…
But we can make it within...

702
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,200
26分9秒内抵达
Twenty-six minutes, nine seconds.

703
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,280
伊芙，你的计画有两大缺失
Eve, your plan contains two major flaws.

704
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,400
好
Okay.

705
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:04,030
第一，英克尔在15公里外
One, Encom is 9.2 miles away,

706
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,990
而我们这辆车目前的速度欠佳
given our present speed and suboptimal choice of vehicle.

707
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,070
天啊

754
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,570
让你感到空虚消沉

死马当活马医
Well, here goes nothing.

848
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:56,950
也许马还没死
Or here goes something.

849
01:10:58,570 --> 01:10:59,570
你说得对
You're right.

与这起事件有关

但有关单位依然三缄其口

民众和官方都想知道

不是用这台，是他们的 -不可能
-Not this one. Theirs. -That's impossible.

957
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,150

我不懂，你是活的吗？

对那里有何看法？
What did you make of it out there?

979
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,110
一言难尽
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

980

你也能帮我说一遍
You can say that again.

981
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,610
一言难尽
It's hard to put in a nutshell.

你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

984

真的吗？
Really?

990
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,490
我为什么该帮你？
What makes you think I should help you?

991
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:54,320
不，重点不是我
No, it's not about me.

992
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,900
已经不是了
Not anymore.

993
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,400
我有朋友身陷险境，她需要我帮忙
I have a friend in danger, and she needs my help.

994
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:03,280
有意思
Fascinating.

995
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:08,950
有意思
Fascinating.

996
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,740
亚杰，传提示给我 -好
-Ajay, can you send the prompt, please? -Sure, yeah.

997
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,990
伊芙 -先别烦我，赛斯
-Hey, Eve. -Not now, Seth.

998
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,320
好，你确定吗？
Okay. Hey, are you sure?

999
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,110
好像有一架识别者往这边飞来
Because that looks like an actual Recognizer flying towards us.

1000
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,240
那是什么东西？
What in God's name is that?

1001
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,280
是雅典娜
It's Athena.

1002
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,110
她回来了
She's back.

1003
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,240
只要狄林杰网络上线，她就会一直来
As long as the Dillinger Network is online, she'll keep coming.

1004
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,490
抓到我，她就能得到恒久程式码
If she gets me, she gets the Permanence Code.

1005
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:49,400
雷射，雅典娜的雷射
The laser. Athena's laser!

1006
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,820
狄林杰使用一种无线直连协定
The Dillingers run a wireless direct link protocol,

1007
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,950
我们用剩下的雷射探测，追溯返航路径
so let's use what's left of the laser to ping the network and trace a path home.

1008
01:24:57,030 --> 01:25:00,450
一旦连线，就能破坏整个狄林杰网络
Once you have a connection, then you can nuke the whole Dillinger Grid.

1009
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:03,240
那是唯一彻底阻止她的方法
And that's the only way to stop her for good.

1010
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,990
伊芙，你在说什么？她就在那里
Eve, what are you talking about? She's right there.

1011
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:11,780
我该走了 -等等，什么？
-I gotta go. -Wait, what?

1012
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,780
我会尽量牵制她
I'll keep her away for as long as I can.

1013
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,860
什么？ -我帮你们争取时间
-What? -I'm gonna buy you some time.

1014
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,700
伊芙 -你们可以的
-Eve... -You guys got this.

1015
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:32,610
（追踪目标中，伊芙金）

1016
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:42,820
没错，我应该有问题
You're right. I think there is something wrong with me.

1017
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,490
或者，也许你有好的地方
Or maybe there's something right with you.

1018
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,820
也许你只是在学习
Well, maybe you're just learning.

1019
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,860
我们都应该那么做
That's what we all ought to be doing.

1020
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:55,490
当年科技刚开始萌芽时
Back in the day, when tech was young,

1021
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:58,820
我会想：“我们进展得好快”
I'd think, "Damn, we're moving fast."

1022
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:03,950
进展快，就会抛下一些东西
You move fast, you leave stuff behind.

1023
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,820
这世纪出生的人有多少个听过莫札特？
How many people born in this century have even heard of Mozart?

1024
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,860
我喜欢莫札特
I like Mozart.

1025
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:19,700
但老实说，我比较喜欢流行尖端
That said, if I'm being honest, I prefer Depeche Mode.

1026
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,530
是吗？怎么说？
Really? Why is that?

1027
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,700
一个被誉为西方文明史上
I know one is considered the greatest composer

1028
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,650
最伟大的作曲家
in the history of Western civilization,

1029
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:31,070
一个是80年代的合成流行乐团
the other a synth pop band from the '80s,

1030
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:35,990
但他们的音乐兼具实验性与流行元素
but I find their balance of technological exploration and pop hooks

1031
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:37,450
再加上…
combined with...

1032
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:42,070
再加上…
combined with...

1033
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,860
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1034
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:48,280
我无法用言语形容对流行尖端的喜爱
I can't put my love of Depeche Mode into words.

1035
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,200
那只是…
It's just a...

1036
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,740
什么？
A what?

1037
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,900
一种感觉
A feeling.

1038
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,820
非常好
Very good.

1039
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,650
非常好
Very good, man.

1040
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,650
一艘大如摩天楼的飞船刚进入本市领空
An airship the size of a skyscraper has just crossed into the city's airspace

1041
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,450
并前往市区…
and is headed for the downtown area...

1042
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,240
你…
You...

1043
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:30,450
是你造成的
You did this.

1044
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:37,360
今晚，军方…
And tonight, as military...

1045
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,530
了不起，完全分段的零信任架构
Impressive. Fully segmented zero trust architecture.

1046
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:43,450
可以抵御垂直、横向或混合攻击
Built to be totally impregnable to vertical, lateral or hybrid attacks.

1047
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,900
（狄林杰网络，连线中断）

1048
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,530
可恶，连不上 -这里也是
-Damn it. Can't get a connection, dude. -No luck here either.

1049
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,900
（遭拒）

1050
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,280
（疯狂空间）

1051
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,400
请立即撤离本区域
Please evacuate the area.

1052
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:24,450
那是什么？找反恐特警组 -请求支援
-What is that thing? Bring in SWAT! -Requesting backup.

1053
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,110
天啊
Oh, my God.

1054
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,360
天啊
Oh, my God!

1055
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,240
来啊，再靠近一点
Come on. A little closer.

1056
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:38,650
（伊芙金）

1057
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,570
毒蛇一号呼叫基地，看见敌方
Viper-1 to Base. Tally on hostile.

1058
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:14,360
目视确认目标
Confirm visual ID.

1059
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,110
攻击，狐狸二号飞弹已发射
Engaging. Fox-2 Missile away.

1060
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,610
未命中，飞弹已被拦截
Splash negative. Missile intercepted.

1061
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:31,280
注意，敌方护航战斗机快速逼近
Be advised, enemy fighter escorts inbound and moving fast.

1062
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,570
收到，渡鸦一号，评估威胁态势
Copy, Raven-1. Assess and report threat posture.

1063
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,700
毒蛇一号，看见多架敌机
Viper-1, tally multiple bandits.

1064
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,610
确认对方有敌意
Hostile intent confirmed.

1065
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:47,650
求救…我被击中了
Mayday. Mayday. I'm hit.

1066
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,110
毒蛇一号，弹射逃生
Viper-1. Punching out.

1067
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:04,490
（发射）

1068
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:16,400
各位，各位
Guys? Guys.

1069
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:18,400
天啊，有几百个
Oh, my God. There's hundreds of 'em.

1070
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:20,900
他们在追伊芙
They're going after Eve.

1071
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,320
进不了狄林杰伺服器就没东西可救了
If we can't access the Dillinger server, there's gonna be nothing left to save.

1072
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,030
渡鸦一号呼叫基地，敌机发动攻击
Base, this is Raven-1. Enemy aircraft engaging.

1073
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,360
我在防御状态
I'm defensive.

1074
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:15,200
有多架敌机，转向主要目标
Multiple bandits. Redirected to primary target.

1075
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,110
我被击中了，弹射逃生
I'm hit. Punching out.

1076
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:11,110
准备好了吗？
Ready?

1077
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:15,860
希望如此，无法回头了
Hope you are, man, 'cause there's no going back.

1078
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,610
恒久
Permanence.

1079
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,150
说来好玩
Funny.

1080
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,950
我发现它时就是这么叫它
When I found it, that's what I called it.

1081
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,280
我现在学聪明了
I know better now.

1082
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:36,740
应该叫短暂程式码
Ought to be called the Impermanence Code.

1083
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:57,150
后门通往我的旧实验室
The back door to my old lab.

1084
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,990
一次机会
One go-around.

1085
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,860
你只有一次
That's all you've got.

1086
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,200
一次机会…
One...

1087
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,700
就是我要的
is all I want.

1088
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,780
我喜欢
Love that!

1089
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:20,650
你不断令我惊奇
You keep surprising me!

1090
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:27,110
那我们就在地面进行
We'll do this from the ground then.

1091
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,280
（创界网络）

1092
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,400
（费林）

1093
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:26,280
（抵达转移区所需时间）

1094
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,150
据报上面可能有一个平民
...and there are reports that a civilian may be onboard,

1095
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,740
代表可能有人遭到挟持
making this a possible hostage scenario.

1096
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:37,320
雅典娜，她一定抓到伊芙了
Athena. She must've gotten Eve.

1097
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,490
进入山区
...into the mountains.

1098
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:41,570
喂…
Hey, hey, hey!

1099
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:50,820
我们很快就回创界网络
Soon we'll be back on the Grid.

1100
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:59,070
将军，感谢你今晚拨空接受访问
General, thank you for taking the time to speak with us tonight.

1101
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:00,860
艾琳，赛斯
Hey, Erin. Seth.

1102
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,240
（连接狄林杰网络中）

1103
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,110
（连线已建立）

1104
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,780
停止计时器
Stop the clock.

1105
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,200
不会吧，你进去了？
No way. You're in?

1106
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,570
我用角落办公室是有原因的
There's a reason why I have the corner office, my man.

1107
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,280
嘿
Hey.

1108
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,570
你回来了
You came back.

1109
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:25,650
你怎么…
How did you...

1110
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,860
姑且说我有朋友帮忙
Let's just say I had a little help from a friend.

1111
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,780
等等，狄林杰网络…
Wait, the Dillinger Grid...

1112
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,570
亚杰和赛斯…
Ajay and Seth, they...

1113
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,110
快走 -不
-Go. -No.

1114
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,820
战神
Ares!

1115
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,200
（战神，消解错误）

1116
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,570
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1117
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,360
你没时间了，雅典娜
You're out of time, Athena.

1118
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,070
而你要没命了
And you're out of lives.

1119
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:05,070
我会杀了你，再回来找她
I'll kill you and come back for her.

1120
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,990
她要的是你
It's you she wants.

1121
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:20,990
让她拿到程式码就完了
If she gets the code, she can't be stopped.

1122
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:24,030
你曾拥有一切
You had everything.

1123
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:25,530
快跑 -不
-Go. -No.

1124
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:29,400
最先进、最强大的能力，你却轻易放弃
The most advanced, the most powerful, and you gave it away.

1125
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,450
为了她？
For her?

1126
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,740
快跑
Go!

1127
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,820
这是你的末日
This is the end for you.

1128
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,900
有效负载准备转移
Payload ready for transfer.

1129
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:24,990
运送中
Shipping it.

1130
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:26,070
（狄林杰，执行网络清除，自毁）

1131
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:27,030

我们接到命令，它是我们的使命

Are you good?

1187

好像有肋骨断了

说来奇怪，恒久…
Yeah. It's funny, permanence.

1197
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:09,490
有个智者说它应该叫“短暂程式码”
A wise man once told me it should have been called the "Impermanence Code."

1198
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,360
我想那就是生命的特点
I guess that's the thing about life.

1199
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:15,860
没有什么是恒久的
There's nothing quite permanent about it.

亲爱的伊芙
Dear Eve,

1226
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,200
自从上次见到你
since I last saw you,

1227
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,950
我都过著所谓的“外网络”生活
I've been living what they call "off-grid."

1228
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:27,030
我故意用双关语
Pun intended.

1229
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:31,400
我在旅行中见到不可思议的事物
In my travels, I've seen incredible things.

1230
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:37,110
尽管奇妙、美丽，我却发觉生活…
Despite its wonder and beauty, I've come to realize that life is…

1231
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:39,950
呃，一言难尽
Well, it's hard to put in a nutshell.

1232
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:44,450
有时我会想百年后我们会在哪里
Some days, I find myself wondering where we'll be a hundred years from now

1233
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:46,150
（神秘伙伴在英克尔有何角色？）

1234
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,200
跟我同类的人如何融入未来
and how others like me might fit into that future.

1235
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:53,990
我觉得可能不只有我有这些疑问
I feel like I might not be alone with these questions.

1236
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:58,490
现在，我想世人还没准备要认识我
For now, I don't think the world is quite ready to meet me,

1237
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:01,780
但我正在认识这个世界
but I am meeting the world.

1238
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:06,070
所以，等那一刻终于来临
And so,when that introduction finally comes,

1239
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,320
就像我一个好友说的
as a good friend of mine once said,

1240
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:14,150
“或许未知带来的终究没那么可怕”
"Maybe what emerges from the unknown won't be so scary after all."

（半圆顶小屋）

1242
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,030
期待再相见
Until we meet again,

1243
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:22,150
