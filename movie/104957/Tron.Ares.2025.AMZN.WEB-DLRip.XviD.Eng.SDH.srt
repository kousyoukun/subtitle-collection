and supremely intelligent.

He is fully proprietary
and 100% expendable.

163
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,583
Ares is the ultimate soldier.

164
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,458
He needs no food, no water,
sheds no blood.

165

And if, by some miracle,

he is struck down
on the battlefield,

[General] With all that

You promised a big win

The question is not whether

having a moment?

eldest daughter of founder
Edward Dillinger, deceased.

203
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,083
Longtime CEO during a
relatively unremarkable period

204

before being superseded

205

It's a pleasure.

Unremarkable?

Market share was up 12%

That's hardly...

And anyway, we don't say
it "superseded," we...

- Twenty-nine.

Deceiving your investors,

222
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,166

Straighten up.

It's Athena.

She's back.

1218
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:39,833
As long as the Dillinger
Network is online,

1219
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:41,041
she'll keep coming.

1220
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:44,291
If she gets me,
she gets the Permanence Code.

1221

The laser. Athena's laser!

1222
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:52,625
The Dillingers run a wireless
direct link protocol,

1223
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,166
so let's use
what's left of the laser

1224
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,750
to ping the network
and trace a path home.

1225
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,208
Once you have a connection,

1226

then you can nuke
the whole Dillinger Grid.

A wise man once told me

it should have been called
the "Impermanence Code."
