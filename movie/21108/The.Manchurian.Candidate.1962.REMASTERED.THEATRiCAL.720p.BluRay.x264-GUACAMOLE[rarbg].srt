1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,140
(motor rumbling)

2
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,426
- (# band plays traditional jazz)
- (indistinct chatter, laughter)

3
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,354
(indistinct chatter)

4
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,076
(whistle blowing)

5
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,328
- Joint raided!
- No, no.

6
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,498
It's just our Raymond,
our loveable Sergeant Shaw.

7
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,793
- All right, let's go, you men! Come on!
- (indistinct grumbling)

8
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:30,590
- Let's go!
- Come on, Sarge. Gertrude buy you beer.

9
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,426
What's the matter him?

10
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,930
I'm afraid our Saint Raymond,
he don't approve. (chortling)

11
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,310
Well, maybe he's got a girl
back home or something.

12
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,062
Him? Our Raymond? Are you kidding?!

13
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,065
Silvers, how about the robe?

14
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,569
- What do you mean, my robe? Get out!
- (laughter)

15
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,577
(rapid gunfire in distance)

16
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,390
- Bad here.
- How do you know?

17
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,392
Chunjin born two miles
from here, Captain.

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,355
Every place we've been in Korea,
this joker was born two miles from it.

19
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,900
- What's so bad about it?
- Tricky. Swamp all around.

20
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,820
- Thirty yards up, maybe quicksand.
- Nobody said anything about quicksand.

21
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,280
(rapid gunfire continues)

22
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,784
- Can't we go round it?
- No, Sergeant.

23
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,995
- What's your personal advice?
- All walk in single line,

24
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,205
next 200 yards.

25
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,208
Rejected. Not tactical
to advance in a single line.

26
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,461
- Patrol sink.
- (aircraft flying overhead)

27
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,215
- Can't we go around it?
- No, Sergeant.

28
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,300
OK, pass the word.

29
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,315
(grunting)

30
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,116
(speaks Russian)

31
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,362
(indistinct shouting)

32
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,149
- (# band plays military march)
- (crowd cheering)

33
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,536
(man) This nation jealously
guards its highest award for valor,

34
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,830
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

35
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:17,626
In the Korean War,
with 5,720,000 personnel engaged,

36
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,505
only 77 men were so honored.

37
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:26,594
One of these 77 men
was Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

38
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,598
Raymond Shaw was returned
from combat and flown to Washington

39
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,143
to be decorated personally
by the President of the United States.

40
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:38,147
This is why his presence,
or that of any Medal of Honor winner,

41
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,526
is sufficient to bring generals
to their feet, saluting.

42
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,996
Congratulations, son. How do you feel?

43
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,291
Like Captain Idiot
in Astounding Science comics.

44
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,919
(woman) Hold it, General!

45
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,466
Hold it, General, please!
Get in there quickly, quickly!

46
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,222
Mother, what is this?
What are you doing here?

47
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,316
Senator Iselin, how does it feel to be
the father of a Medal of Honor winner?

48
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,861
- He's not my father!
- He's Raymond's stepfather.

49
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,490
I can only say
that as one who has devoted his life

50
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,368
- to the service of his country...
- You did this, Mother.

51
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,162
You organized
this disgusting three-ring circus!

52
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,707
Darling, you're a Medal of Honor winner.
Congratulations.

53
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,253
I was going to write, but we've
been in a frightful mess of late.

54
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,131
All right, let him through!
That's enough now!

55
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,093
That's enough, I said! Let him through!

56
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,263
Say cheese.

57
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,768
All right, that's enough, now.
That's enough. Let the poor boy through.

58
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,233
What's wrong? We've gone
to a good deal of trouble to...

59
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,735
Arrange the parade for you and so forth.

60
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,779
- A parade?
- Get that out!

61
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,323
Why, you publicity-sick,
flag-simple goob!

62
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,909
Just because your parents
and the country...

63
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,997
Who's kidding who, Mother?
Johnny's up for re-election in November.

64
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,334
You've got it all figured out. Johnny
Iselin's boy, Medal of Honor winner.

65
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,128
That should get you 50,000 votes.

66
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,297
I'm your mother.
How can you talk to me this way?

67
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,216
You know I want nothing for myself.

68
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,553
My life is devoted
to helping you and Johnny.

69
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,389
- Mother, stop it.
- My two little boys.

70
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,682
That is all I have...

71
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,059
(man) After his arrival in Washington,

72
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,478
Raymond Shaw was decorated
at the White House

73
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,689
by the President of the United States.

74
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,318
His citation, attested to by his
commanding officer, Captain Marco

75
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,988
and the nine surviving members
of his patrol,

76
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:55,659
read in part: "Displaying valor
above and beyond the call of duty,

77
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,371
did single-handedly save the lives
of nine members of his patrol,

78
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,665
capturing an enemy machine-gun nest

79
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,335
and taking out
a full company of enemy infantry.

80
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,840
He led his patrol, which had been listed
as missing in action for three days,

81
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,468
back through the enemy lines
to safety."

82
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,393
A gift from the Citizens For Iselin
Committee for his last birthday.

83
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,689
It saved our lives during the campaign.
This opens up into a double bed.

84
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,695
This is the press room.

85
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,742
And this... This is my private office.

86
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,912
Anything to take the pain
out of campaigning, eh? (cackling)

87
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,997
That's what I always say!

88
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,001
May I take this thing off now, Mother?

89
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,046
Raymond, what is the matter with you?
You look as if your head

90
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,716
were about to come to a point.
Johnny, fix him a drink.

91
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,928
Sit down, Raymond! We'll be home
in less than two and a half hours.

92
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,556
I'm not going home with you, Mother.
I'm going to New York.

93
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,352
- What?!
- I've got a job on a newspaper.

94
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,813
Research assistant
to Mr. Holborn Gaines.

95
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,899
Holborn Gaines? That Communist?!

96
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,736
He's not a Communist, Mother.
As a matter of fact, he's a Republican.

97
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,697
But the terrible things
he's written about Johnny!

98
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,284
He came to interview me
at the White House.

99
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,621
Afterwards I asked him for a job.
He gave it to me.

100
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,375
We discovered that we had
a great deal in common.

101
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,504
What could you possibly have
in common with that dreadful old man?

102
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,883
For one thing, we discovered that we
both loathe and despise you and Johnny.

103
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,971
And that's a beginning.

104
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,396
(man) The war in Korea was over.

105
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,524
Captain, now Major, Bennett Marco
had been reassigned

106
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,443
to Army Intelligence in Washington.

107
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,867
It was, by and large, a pleasant
assignment, except for one thing.

108
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,955
Night after night, the major was plagued
by the same reoccurring nightmare.

109
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,332
(shuddering)

110
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,227
(whispering) Stop it... Stop it...

111
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,399
Stop it... Stop it...

112
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,486
(woman) Another modern discovery
which we owe to the hydrangea

113
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:41,575
concerns the influence
of air drainage upon plant climate.

114
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,786
Many years ago, when I was
traveling about the country,

115
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,749
I noticed magnificent hydrangeas
on the hills,

116
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,377
where the air drainage was... perfect,

117
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,925
and very poor specimens,
or perhaps none at all, in the valleys.

118
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,178
Formerly, we used to consider
sheltered valleys

119
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,014
more favorable to plants than hilltops.

120
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,935
But the avoidance of late spring
and early autumn frosts

121
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,520
enjoyed by sites with good air drainage,

122
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,191
where the cold air can drain
safely away to lower levels,

123
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,861
gives the hills a decided advantage.

124
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,323
Thus it was the hydrangeas
that gave the first pointer

125
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,495
in another modern discovery
of horticultural importance.

126
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:30,749
From this, it might appear that the
hydrangea is a fairly simple plant,

127
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,543
but there are more complications.

128
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,213
The cultivation of hydrangeas
was evolved

129
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,175
from a number of varieties
originally found in Japan.

130
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,888
Not all of which, of course,
have the same characteristics.

131
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,684
Two of them do not share the quality
of producing blue flowers

132
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,561
in mineral-rich soils.

133
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,364
Allow me to introduce
our American visitors.

134
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,034
I must ask you to forgive
their somewhat lackadaisical manners,

135
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,121
but I have conditioned them,
or brainwashed them,

136
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,707
which I understand
is the new American word,

137
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,376
to believe that they are
waiting out a storm

138
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,087
in the lobby of a small hotel
in New Jersey

139
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,924
where a meeting of
the ladies' garden club is in progress.

140
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,053
You will notice
that I have told them they may smoke.

141
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,890
(chuckling) I've allowed my people
to have a little fun

142
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,603
in the selection of
bizarre tobacco substitutes!

143
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,190
Are you enjoying your cigarette, Ed?

144
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,820
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yak dung.

145
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,532
"Tastes good...
like a cigarette should!" (cackles)

146
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,950
(men chuckling)

147
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,952
Now then, comrades...

148
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,872
May I present
the famous Raymond Shaw.

149
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,294
(man) Young man you've flown 8,000 miles
to this dreary spot in Manchuria to see.

150
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:01,089
Raymond, pull your chair
over here by me, please.

151
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,304
I am sure you've all heard
the old wives' tale

152
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,015
that no hypnotized subject
may be forced to do

153
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,811
that which is repellent to
his moral nature, whatever that may be.

154
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,646
Nonsense, of course!

155
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:21,318
Oh, you note-takers might set down
a reminder to consult Brenman's paper,

156
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,154
Experiments
in the Hypnotic Production

157
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,491
of Antisocial and
Self-Injurious Behavior,

158
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,160
or Wells' 1941 paper which was titled,

159
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,955
I believe, Experiments in
the Hypnotic Production of Crime.

160
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,667
Or, of course,
Andrew Salter's remarkable book,

161
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:42,297
Conditioned Reflex Therapy,
to name only three.

162
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,634
Or, if it offends you
that only the West is working

163
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,637
to manufacture more crime
and better criminals...

164
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,264
Against the modern shortages,

165
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:55,268
I suggest Krasnogorski's
Primary Violence Motivation,

166
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,815
or Serov's The Unilateral Suggestion
to Self-Destruction.

167
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:05,278
My dear Yen, as you grow older,
you grow more long-winded.

168
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,115
Can't we get to the point?

169
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,952
Has the man ever killed anyone,
or has he not?

170
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,122
I apologize, my dear Dimitri.

171
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,499
I keep forgetting
that you're a young country

172
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,336
and your attention span is limited.

173
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,298
Tell me, Raymond.
Have you ever killed anyone?

174
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,261
- No, ma'am.
- Not even in combat?

175
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,304
In combat?

176
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,890
Yes, ma'am, I think so.

177
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:38,395
Of course you have, Raymond. Raymond
has been a crack shot since childhood.

178
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:43,817
Marvelous outlet for his aggressions.
May I have the bayonet, please?

179
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,903
Not with the knife. With the hands.

180
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
With the hands?

181
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,991
Here. Have him use this.

182
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,034
(speaking in foreign language)

183
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:04,087
Raymond, whom do you dislike
the least in your group here today?

184
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,214
- The least?
- That's right.

185
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,010
I guess Captain Marco, ma'am.

186
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,722
Notice how he is always
drawn to authority?

187
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,432
That won't do, Raymond.

188
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,227
We need the captain
to get you your medal. Who else?

189
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,565
- Well, I guess Ed Mavole, ma'am.
- Ah, that's better.

190
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,609
Now then, Raymond.

191
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,611
Take this scarf...

192
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,949
...and strangle Ed Mavole...

193
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,661
- ...to death.
- (quietly) Yes, ma'am.

194
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,042
- Excuse me.
- Hmm-hmm.

195
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,339
Pardon me.

196
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,641
- Hey, Sarge, cut it out!
- Quiet, Ed, please!

197
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,686
Now, you just sit there quietly
and cooperate.

198
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,730
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,817
(gasps, choking)

200
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,655
(choking noises continue)

201
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,365
(screaming)

202
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Major, to your knowledge,

203
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,830
have any other ex-members
of your patrol had similar dreams?

204
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,833
No, sir. Not to my knowledge.

205
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,505
Doesn't it strike anyone as curious that

206
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:33,468
Mavole was one of
the two men lost in the action, and...

207
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,888
...yet every night in my dream,
he's the...

208
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,267
...he's the one that Raymond...

209
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,356
- I'm sorry, gentlemen.
- Now, Major Marco.

210
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,859
Since you first brought your
recurring dream to our attention,

211
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,281
Raymond Shaw, his life, background,
habits, friends and associates

212
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,910
have been under scrupulous examination.
The facts speak for themselves.

213
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,705
His stepfather
is a United States senator.

214
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,000
His mother is head of
15 different patriotic organizations.

215
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,545
Raymond Shaw is confidential assistant
to Holborn Gaines,

216
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,006
our most respected political journalist.

217
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,174
- It's inconceivable...
- (man) Major Marco.

218
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,260
As the consulting psychiatrist,

219
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,388
I'd like to hear your
personal feelings about Shaw.

220
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,644
Raymond Shaw is the kindest,
bravest, warmest,

221
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,980
most wonderful human being
I've ever known.

222
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:32,235
I see. This opinion, Major,
was it generally held?

223
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,821
His fellow soldiers, did they feel
the same way toward him?

224
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,033
The men loved him, sir.

225
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,243
Why shouldn't they?
He saved their lives.

226
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:45,832
It would seem obvious to me that Major
Marco was suffering a delayed reaction

227
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,376
to 18 months
of continuous combat in Korea.

228
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:53,214
I would recommend that the matter
of Raymond Shaw be dropped right now

229
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,884
and that Major Marco
be temporarily reassigned

230
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:59,846
to less strenuous and,
if I may say so, less sensitive duties.

231
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,558
I think a few months' detached service

232
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,895
to perhaps the Public Relations Corps

233
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,148
should put the major
right back in the pink.

234
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,942
- Mr. Secretary! Mr. Secretary!
- (indistinct chatter)

235
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,529
Can you explain
the proposed cut in budget?

236
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,866
Since you've asked
a simple-minded question,

237
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,119
I will give you
an equally simple-minded answer.

238
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,581
Since no great naval power
menaces the free world today,

239
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,835
the navy's overwhelming preponderance
of surface ships seems superfluous.

240
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,171
Hence the cut in budget.

241
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,967
Major, my time is important. How much
longer must we go on with this nonsense?

242
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,260
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,765
If there are no further questions for
the secretary, that wraps things up.

244
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,145
Mr. Secretary. I have a question, sir.

245
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,855
(man) Who are you, sir?

246
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,651
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin,

247
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,237
and I have a question so serious

248
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:01,783
that the safety of our nation
may well depend on your answer.

249
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,994
Who?

250
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,791
No evasions, Mr. Secretary!
No evasions, if you please, sir.

251
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,294
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What kind of foolishness is this?

252
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,298
I'm new at this job,
but it's not good to talk that way

253
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,426
to a US senator,
even if he is an idiot.

254
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,846
(Iselin) I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin,

255
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:28,059
and I have here
a list of the names of 207 persons

256
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,603
who are known
by the Secretary of Defense

257
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,231
as being members
of the Communist Party!

258
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,399
- What?!
- (all shouting)

259
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,778
Who are still, nevertheless,
working at shaping

260
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,865
the policy of the Defense Department!

261
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:46,536
- Senator who?
- I demand an answer, Mr. Secretary!

262
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,080
There will be no covering up, sir.

263
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,791
- What?
- No covering up.

264
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,627
You will not get your hands
on this list!

265
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,713
How did you get in here
in the first place?! Major,

266
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,299
- throw that lunatic out of here!
- I deeply regret having to say

267
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,217
in front of these
ladies and gentlemen...

268
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,555
- You claim you're a defender?
- ...of our great country

269
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:09,309
that you no longer
have my confidence, sir!

270
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,812
You're an idiot, if you ask me!
You're out of your mind...

271
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,400
...no longer a matter for investigation
by the Defense Department!

272
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:21,196
- You have lost your chance, sir.
- Get that man out of this room!

273
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,617
This matter is now the responsibility
of the United States Senate.

274
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:31,122
Get him out of this room! I will not
have him here, do you hear? Not ever!

275
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,460
If I ever catch you in this room again,
I'll throw you out bodily.

276
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:40,924
Get out of here! Don't you take
my picture anymore! Clear this room!

277
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,926
(lively chatter continues in distance)

278
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,178
Senator! Senator Iselin.

279
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,474
I'd like to verify that number, sir.
How many Communists did you say?

280
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,770
Major, I said there are exactly...
I have absolute proof there are

281
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,940
104 card-carrying Communists
in the Defense Department.

282
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,776
- How many, sir?
- (grunts) Two hundred seventy-five.

283
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,821
And that's all I have to say
on the subject now. Come, babe.

284
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,659
- Major, how many did he say?
- Excuse me a moment. Boys, please.

285
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,911
Major, how many did he say?

286
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,891
(gasping)

287
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,529
(light applause)

288
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,079
Now, ladies...

289
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,791
- Very good, Raymond.
- Thank you, ma'am.

290
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,251
Captain Marco?

291
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,254
- Yes, ma'am?
- On your feet, Captain, please!

292
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,674
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Captain...

293
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,719
When you are returned
with your patrol to Korea

294
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,513
and you go to Command Headquarters,

295
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,141
what will be the first duty
you will undertake?

296
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,353
I will make my report
on the patrol, ma'am.

297
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,898
What will you report?

298
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:24,652
I will recommend urgently that Raymond
Shaw be posted for the Medal of Honor.

299
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,198
He saved our lives and took out
a complete company of Chinese infantry.

300
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,868
A complete company?
What the hell is this?

301
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,621
We can spare
an imaginary company of infantry

302
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,666
for this particular plan,
Mikhail Mikanich.

303
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,546
All right. If we are out
to humiliate our brave Chinese ally

304
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,132
in the newspapers of the world,

305
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,093
we might as well make it
a full battalion.

306
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,889
We don't object, comrade.
I assure you of that.

307
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:57,060
However, comrade, we thank you for
thinking of the matter in that light.

308
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,353
(clinking)

309
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,815
If we may proceed
with the demonstration?

310
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,609
Raymond.

311
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,366
Who's that little fellow
sitting next to the captain?

312
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,579
That's Bobby Lembeck.
Our mascot, I guess you'd call him.

313
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:20,208
(man) Doesn't look old enough
to be in your army.

314
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,378
I guess he isn't,
but there he is, ma'am.

315
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,882
Captain Marco, would you be good
enough to lend Raymond your pistol?

316
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,051
(Marco) Yes, ma'am.

317
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,600
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sure, kid.

318
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,064
Shoot Bobby, Raymond.
Through the forehead.

319
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,775
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,783
(gunshot)

321
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,660
(hysterical screaming)

322
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,538
Honey! Honey!

323
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:02,083
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up, it's all right. It's all right!

324
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,128
- It's all right. It's all right.
- (whimpering)

325
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,922
All right. It's all right.

326
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,966
- That same dream again?
- (gasping)

327
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,597
What makes it so awful is that

328
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,435
I keep dreaming a thing
like that about Sergeant Shaw.

329
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,771
It's been going on for weeks now.

330
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,815
I must be going crazy!

331
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:30,153
- You want to write to Sergeant Shaw.
- I tell you, nothing's wrong with me!

332
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,989
Ask him if anyone else
is having dreams like yours.

333
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,490
- Yeah?
- Yes.

334
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:39,328
Maybe I will. Yeah.
Maybe I'll do that.

335
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:46,502
- If anybody can help me, he can!
- You like him a lot, don't you?

336
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,671
Raymond Shaw is
the bravest, kindest, warmest,

337
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,882
most wonderful human being
I've ever known.

338
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,015
(man) Dear Sarge.

339
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,476
I had to say this or write this
to someone

340
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,603
because I think I'm going nuts.

341
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,440
And since you were
my best friend in the Army, here goes.

342
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,609
Sarge, I'm in trouble.

343
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,405
I'm afraid to go to sleep
because I have terrible dreams.

344
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,908
I dream about all the guys on the patrol
where you won the medal.

345
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,578
The dream has
a lot of Chinese people in it,

346
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,622
and a lot of big brass
from the Russian Army.

347
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,126
Well, it's pretty rough,
you have to take my word for that.

348
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,295
(phone ringing)

349
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,220
- (man) Raymond Shaw, please.
- This is he.

350
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,847
Raymond.

351
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,601
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?

352
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,368
(phone ringing)

353
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,457
- (man) Raymond.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,002
- Can you see the red queen?
- Yes, sir.

355
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,630
Good.

356
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:23,761
One week from next Saturday,
you will be called for at 11:10am

357
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:29,350
and taken to the Timothy Swardon
Sanitarium, 84 East 61st Street.

358
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,354
We want you there for a checkup.
Is that clear?

359
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,648
Yes, sir.

360
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,485
You may put the cards away now.
Goodbye, Raymond.

361
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,962
Mr. Gaines. It's Mr. Shaw.

362
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,881
He was run down in the street
by a hit-and-run driver.

363
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,926
- It just came over the AP.
- Good heavens!

364
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,970
Find out what hospital he's in
and call them.

365
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,972
See if there's anything
we can do to help.

366
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,936
You're welcome. Bye.

367
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,316
That was Mr. Gaines from his newspaper.

368
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,652
He said to tell him to take it easy
and not to worry about a thing.

369
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,571
Which of course you will not tell him

370
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,699
on the chance it is
some sort of prearranged code.

371
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,451
(knocking at door)

372
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,336
- Comrade Zilkov?
- Yes?

373
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,130
Yen Lo. Pavlov Institute.

374
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,803
Doctor. An honor and a pleasure.

375
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,974
You may go. (snapping fingers)

376
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,489
When did you arrive?

377
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:10,785
I was flown in last night
under embassy quota. Revolting journey.

378
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,413
Ah, Raymond. It's nice to see you again.

379
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,540
It's nice to see you again, sir.

380
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,003
We're going through
this elaborate procedure

381
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,756
simply out of precaution.

382
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,133
In case there are any visitors.

383
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,804
Although I cannot imagine
who will visit Raymond.

384
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,768
- Attractive flat you have here.
- Thank you, Doctor.

385
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,854
It's actually a rest home
for wealthy alcoholics.

386
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,483
We were able to purchase it
three years ago.

387
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,693
Except for this floor and the one above,

388
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:49,115
which we sealed off for security
purposes, the rest functions normally.

389
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,492
It is one of the few
Soviet operations in America

390
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,995
that showed a profit
at the end of the last fiscal year.

391
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,581
Profit? Fiscal year? (tuts)

392
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,544
Beware, my dear Zilkov. The virus
of capitalism is highly infectious.

393
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,380
Soon, you'll be lending
money out at interest!

394
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,715
(laughing)

395
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:11,011
You must try, Comrade Zilkov,
to cultivate a sense of humor.

396
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,721
There's nothing like
a good laugh now and then

397
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,808
to lighten the burdens of the day.

398
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,687
Tell me, Raymond. Do you remember
murdering Mavole and Lembeck?

399
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,733
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- Mavole and Lembeck.

400
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,528
The men who were lost on the patrol.

401
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,406
Can you recall what happened to them?

402
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:36,078
Yes, sir. It was a very
clear action for a night action.

403
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,664
Captain Marco sent up some low flares,

404
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,375
so it was easy to see
what was happening.

405
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,587
Bobby Lembeck got separated to the left.

406
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,256
Mavole went after him.

407
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:50,759
By the time he reached him,
the enemy had a fix on the position.

408
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,264
They were killed instantly
by a high mortar shell.

409
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,600
I don't think they
ever knew what hit 'em.

410
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,312
Do you realize, comrade,
the implications of the weapon

411
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,273
that has been placed at your disposal?

412
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,775
You may remove your
head bandage, Raymond.

413
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,697
A normally conditioned American
who has been trained to kill,

414
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,867
and then to have
no memory of having killed.

415
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:19,038
Without memory of his deed,
he cannot possibly feel guilt.

416
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:23,083
Nor will he, of course,
have any reason to fear being caught.

417
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,963
Having been relieved of those uniquely
American symptoms, guilt and fear,

418
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,550
he cannot possibly give himself away.

419
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:36,347
Our Raymond will remain
an outwardly normal, productive, sober

420
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,475
and respected member of the community.

421
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:43,562
And I should say,
if properly used, entirely police-proof.

422
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,525
His brain has not only
been washed, as they say,

423
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,195
it has been dry-cleaned. (cackling)

424
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,909
Thank you, Raymond.
You may replace your head bandage.

425
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:02,831
Sealed floors or no, you will permit him
to have visitors, to avoid suspicion.

426
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,668
- Of course.
- My specialists are being

427
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,505
flown in tonight. It will take about
a week, working between visiting hours,

428
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,757
to check the mechanism out.

429
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:17,429
It's been, after all, two years
since the conditioning took place.

430
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,683
You want to be sure the linkages
are still functioning correctly

431
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,852
before he's turned over
to his American operator.

432
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,731
(exclaims) Now, comrade,
if you will excuse me.

433
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,275
Where are you going?

434
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,027
Since I can do nothing
until my specialists arrive,

435
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,781
I had thought to spend
the afternoon at Macy's.

436
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,868
Madame Yen has given me
the most appalling list.

437
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,582
No, no.

438
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,084
I personally guarantee it.

439
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,545
He is ready to be turned over
to his American operator.

440
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,215
And I, being personally responsible
for Soviet security

441
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,343
in the entire Eastern seaboard
of the United States,

442
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,762
refuse to turn him over
to his operator

443
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,266
until at least one practical test
has been run.

444
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,060
You say the man has
been built as an assassin.

445
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,314
Very well, then.
Let him assassinate someone.

446
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,898
(scoffing)

447
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:15,362
I'm shocked that a security officer
with the responsibility you hold

448
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:21,243
would risk a mechanism as valuable
as Raymond out of sheer nervousness.

449
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,497
You yourself admit the man
has not killed for over two years.

450
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,919
I assure you, Doctor, conditions
offering minimum risk can be arranged.

451
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,172
All right. If you insist
on this foolishness,

452
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,091
have him kill
one of your people in here.

453
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,052
I would, I would gladly.

454
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,264
But our table of organization
is under acceptable strength.

455
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,266
Why can't we be reasonable about this?

456
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,062
Why can't he kill some
non-productive person on the outside?

457
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,147
Very well, then.

458
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,859
But for his own protection, he must
be instructed that if he is ever,

459
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,446
at any time, discovered
at the scene of an assignment,

460
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:01,617
this other person, or persons,
must also be killed.

461
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:06,580
All right. All right, Doctor!
Whom do you think he should kill?

462
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:21,553
With humor, my dear Zilkov!
Always with a little humor.

463
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:27,142
If kill we must for a better New York,
why should it not be...

464
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,854
...his superior at the newspaper, Mr...

465
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,398
...Holborn Gaines?

466
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,775
With Mr. Gaines out of the way,

467
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:39,947
might he not then be given
that very influential job himself?

468
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,991
(Gaines) Who's there?

469
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,285
(Raymond) It's me, Mr. Gaines.

470
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,038
Raymond.

471
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,712
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

472
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,924
Don't get any silly ideas about
this ridiculous-looking bed jacket.

473
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,302
It was my wife's.
It's the warmest thing I have.

474
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,972
Perfect for reading in bed at night.

475
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,852
- I didn't know you were married, sir.
- She died nearly six years ago.

476
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,646
What the devil
are you doing here at 4am?

477
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,190
Anyway, I thought
you were in the hospital?

478
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,154
Oh, now, don't tell me that you've
come here at this ridiculous hour

479
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,782
to talk something over?
You're not gonna pour out your heart

480
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,661
with the details
of some sordid love affair?

481
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,371
No, sir.

482
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,541
As a matter of fact,
they told me you'd be asleep.

483
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,378
- Who told you I'd be asleep?
- They did.

484
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,298
"They"? "They"?

485
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:42,968
Who's this mysterious "they?"

486
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:46,722
Raymond? Answer me, my boy.

487
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,853
(knocking at door)

488
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,573
- Colonel!
- Ben. May I come in for a minute?

489
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,075
Oh, please do. Of course. Come on in.

490
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,248
May I ask the colonel, a,
is this an official visit,

491
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,584
and, b, may I mix you a drink?

492
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,586
A, yes, it is, and b,
you certainly may.

493
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,713
- Scotch all right?
- Fine.

494
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,095
My God, where'd ya get all the books?

495
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,600
I... I got a guy
picks 'em out for me at random.

496
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,395
- Water all right?
- Fine.

497
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,107
He's in... San Francisco.
A little bookstore out there.

498
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,986
And... he ships 'em to me,
wherever I happen to be stationed.

499
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,114
- Have you read them all?
- Yeah.

500
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,327
They'd also make great insulation
against an enemy attack.

501
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,455
But the truth of the matter is
that I'm just interested, you know,

502
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,958
in Principles of Modern Banking

503
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,878
and The History of Piracy,

504
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:05,634
The Paintings of Orozco,
Modern French Theater,

505
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:10,180
The Jurisprudential Factor
of Mafia Administration,

506
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,517
Diseases of Horses
and the novels of Joyce Cary

507
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,312
and... Ethnic Choices of the Arabs.

508
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,314
Things like that.

509
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,824
- Ben.
- Sir.

510
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,618
The Army's got
a lot of things wrong with it,

511
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,873
but it does take care of
its own people, which is why I'm here.

512
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,626
As a public relations officer,
you're a disaster.

513
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,754
- I never wanted the job.
- You permitted the secretary

514
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,174
to make unfortunate remarks
to that idiot, Iselin,

515
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:50,053
- which started him off on a rampage.
- Listen to me, please.

516
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,682
For months, I've been driven
out of my mind by a recurring dream.

517
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,476
- The medical officer...
- What the hell does the Medical Corps

518
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,354
know about intelligence work?

519
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:04,026
I tell you, there's something phony
about me, about Raymond Shaw,

520
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,486
about the whole
Medal of Honor business.

521
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:11,533
For instance, when the psychiatrist
asked me how I felt about Raymond Shaw

522
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:15,913
and how the whole patrol felt about him,
did you hear what I said? Really hear?

523
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,708
I said Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, warmest, bravest,

524
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,544
most wonderful human being
I've ever known.

525
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,924
And even now I feel that way, and yet,
somewhere in the back of my mind,

526
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,636
something tells me it's not true.
It's just not true.

527
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:36,516
It isn't as if Raymond's hard to like.
He's impossible to like!

528
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,646
In fact, he's probably
one of the most repulsive human beings

529
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,982
I've ever known in my whole...
all of my life.

530
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,111
What I came to tell you is Public
Relations has bounced you back to me.

531
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,865
And in your present state,
there's no possible way I can use you.

532
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,494
As of this moment,
I'm placing you on sick leave.

533
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:00,332
Go away, Ben.
Find yourself a girl. Lie in the sun.

534
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,089
I absolutely refuse.

535
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,636
You don't seem to understand.

536
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,393
What I've just told you is not a
suggestion, Major. It is an order.

537
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,693
Yes, sir.

538
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,489
Good night, Ben.

539
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,316
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all. Please do.

540
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,180
(sighing)

541
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,229
Maryland's a beautiful state.

542
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,565
- This is Delaware.
- I know.

543
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:35,112
I was one of the Chinese workmen
who the laid the track on this stretch.

544
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,657
But... nonetheless,
Maryland is a beautiful state.

545
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,159
So is Ohio, for that matter.

546
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:46,748
I guess so. Columbus is a
tremendous football town.

547
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,088
- You in the railroad business?
- Not anymore.

548
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,841
However,
if you will permit me to point out,

549
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:00,387
when you ask that question, you should
say, "Are you in the railroad line?"

550
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,267
Where's your home?

551
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,604
I'm in the Army. I'm a major.

552
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,316
I've been in the Army most of my life.

553
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,360
We move a good deal.

554
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,323
(sighing) I was born in New Hampshire.

555
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,993
I went to a girls' camp once
on Lake Francis.

556
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,122
It's pretty far north.

557
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,087
- What's your name?
- Eugenie.

558
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,342
- Pardon?
- No kidding. I really mean it.

559
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,137
Crazy French pronunciation and all.

560
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,390
- It's pretty.
- Well, thank you.

561
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,935
I guess your friends call you Jenny.

562
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,813
Not yet, they haven't,
for which I am deeply grateful.

563
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,900
But you may call me Jenny.

564
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,277
What do your friends call you?

565
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,489
- Rosie.
- Why?

566
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,035
My full name is Eugenie Rose.

567
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,373
Of the two names,
I've always favored Rosie,

568
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,002
because it smells
of brown soap and beer.

569
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,258
Eugenie is somehow more fragile.

570
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,599
Still, when I asked you what
your name was, you said it was Eugenie.

571
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,438
It's quite possible I was feeling
more or less fragile at that instant.

572
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,612
I could never figure out
what that phrase meant, "more or less."

573
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,494
- Are you Arabic?
- No.

574
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,208
My name is Ben.

575
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:57,379
It's really Bennett.
I was named after Arnold Bennett.

576
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,755
The writer?

577
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:03,468
No. A lieutenant colonel. He was my
father's commanding officer at the time.

578
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,015
- What's your last name?
- Marco.

579
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,769
Major Marco.

580
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:17,023
- Are you Arabic?
- No. No...

581
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,235
Let me put it another way.

582
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,530
- Are you married?
- No.

583
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,573
- You?
- No.

584
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,417
- What's your last name?
- Chaney.

585
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,753
I'm production assistant
for a man named Justin,

586
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,797
who had two hits last season.

587
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:45,427
I live on 54th Street, a few doors
from the Modern Museum of Art,

588
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:49,180
of which I'm a tea-privileges member.
No cream.

589
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,351
I live at 53 West 54th Street.

590
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,230
Apartment 3B.
Can you remember that?

591
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,608
Yes.

592
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:08,450
Eldorado 59970.
Can you remember that?

593
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,620
Yes.

594
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:19,294
Are you stationed in New York?
Or is stationed the right word?

595
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:29,971
I'm not exactly stationed in New York.
I was... stationed in Washington,

596
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:35,477
but I got sick and now I'm on leave
and I'm gonna spend it in New York.

597
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,564
Eldorado 59970.

598
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,574
I'm gonna look up an old friend of mine
who's a newspaper man.

599
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,745
We were in Korea together.

600
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,043
Mr. Shaw, there's
a gentleman outside to see you.

601
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,421
- A gentleman?
- An Oriental gentleman, sir.

602
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,008
He said he was in the Army with you.

603
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:10,345
There were no Oriental gentlemen
in the Army with me.

604
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,889
He is very insistent, sir.

605
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,435
All right, all right. Show him in.

606
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,497
I am Chunjin, Mr. Shaw, sir.

607
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,625
I was interpreter at 32 Charlie Company.

608
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,044
52nd Regiment.

609
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:47,340
Yes, I remember you. You were
the guide and interpreter to the patrol.

610
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,551
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

611
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,723
What can I do for you?
I mean to say, what are you doing here?

612
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,518
Your father did not say to you?

613
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,063
- My father?
- Yes. Senator Iselin.

614
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:05,066
Senator Iselin is not my father.

615
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:09,195
Repeat, he is not my father.

616
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,700
If you learn nothing else on your visit
to this country, memorize that fact.

617
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,703
I write to Senator Iselin.

618
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,747
I tell him how I interpret your outfit.

619
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,792
I tell him I want to come to America.

620
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,087
He get me visa. Now, I need job.

621
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,341
- A job?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

622
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,595
But, my dear fellow,
we don't need interpreters here.

623
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,513
We all speak the same language.

624
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:40,768
I am tailor and mender. I am cook.
I drive car. I am cleaner and scrubber.

625
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,521
I fix anything. I take message.

626
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,192
I sleep at house of my cousin.

627
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,279
I ask for job with you

628
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,949
because you are great man
who save my life.

629
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,457
I could use a valet, I think.

630
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,461
And I would like having a cook.
A good cook, I mean.

631
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:11,174
Very well.
You can live at your cousin's.

632
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,092
I will pay you $60 a week.

633
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,721
You will have every Thursday
and every other Sunday off.

634
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,266
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

635
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:24,062
I'm leaving for Washington in a minute.
I'll be back this evening by 8:30.

636
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,606
I would like to have dinner waiting.

637
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,777
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

638
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,820
Just like United State Army.

639
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,449
Oh, God, I hope not.

640
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,163
(Mother) You'll be marvelous
in there this afternoon, hon.

641
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,082
I just know you are.

642
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,711
Yeah...

643
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,177
There's just one thing, babe.

644
00:50:56,345 --> 00:51:00,390
I'd be a lot happier if we could just
settle on the number of Communists

645
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,850
I know there are
in the Defense Department.

646
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:08,523
I mean, the way you keep changing
the figures on me all the time,

647
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,569
it makes me look like some kind
of a nut, like... like an idiot.

648
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,530
The boys are even starting
to kid me about it.

649
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,866
Just yesterday in the cloakroom,
they said "Hey, Johnny..."

650
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,995
You'll look like an even bigger idiot
if you don't get in there

651
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,957
- and do exactly what you're told.
- Babe...

652
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,544
Who are they writing about all over
this country and what are they saying?

653
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,880
"Are there any Communists
in the Defense Department?"

654
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:37,385
Of course not. They're saying,
"How many Communists are there?"

655
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,805
So stop talking like an expert,
all of a sudden, and get out there

656
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,266
and say what you're supposed to say!

657
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:48,396
- Come on, babe. I...
- I'm sorry, hon.

658
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:53,067
Would it really make it easier for you
if we settled on just one number?

659
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,446
Yeah.

660
00:51:56,614 --> 00:52:01,993
Just one real simple number
that will be easy for me to remember.

661
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:17,175
There are exactly
57 card-carrying members

662
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:22,096
of the Communist Party in the
Department of Defense at this time!

663
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,264
(indistinct chattering)

664
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:26,643
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
Point of order!

665
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,193
(buzzing)

666
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,201
(grunting)

667
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,499
(Chunjin yells)

668
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,841
(Marco) What was Raymond
doing with his hands?

669
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,516
How did the old ladies
turn into Russians?

670
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,778
(yelling, grunting)

671
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,384
(Chunjin yells)

672
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,812
What was Raymond doing with his hands?

673
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,613
(grunting)

674
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,032
(Marco) How did the old ladies
turn into Russians?

675
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,912
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
What were you doing there?

676
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,623
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?!

677
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,042
What were you doing there?!

678
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,818
I must say, it was original of you
to have the police department

679
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,738
call so shyly
and ask for our first date.

680
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,950
Well, they asked me who would...

681
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,412
...who would be willing to...

682
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,582
I know. And thank you.

683
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,752
- Thank you very much.
- (officer speaking Spanish)

684
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,657
I've got to find Raymond.
Maybe he's home by now.

685
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,284
All right, darling, whatever you want.

686
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,204
But first, I have something to tell you.

687
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,624
You know what I was doing when
you so cleverly had the police call me?

688
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,460
Don't bother trying to guess.
You're too tired.

689
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:43,840
I'll tell you what I was doing.
After I dropped you off,

690
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,134
I went straight home,
and when I got upstairs...

691
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,972
- Apartment 3B.
- That's right. Very good!

692
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,268
Before I even took my coat off,
I telephoned my fianc.

693
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:01,232
I told you I wasn't married.
I never said I wasn't engaged.

694
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,026
Well, I called up my fianc,

695
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,363
and he came over as soon as he could,
which was instantly.

696
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,325
And I told him I had just met you,
and I gave him his ring back.

697
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,412
I tried to... convey my regrets

698
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,956
for whatever pain
I might be causing him,

699
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,708
and then, just then,

700
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:22,295
you had the police call to invite me
to meet you at the 24th Precinct.

701
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,256
I grabbed my coat,
kissed my fianc on the cheek,

702
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:29,051
for the last time
we would ever kiss, and I ran.

703
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,682
At the police station, they told me you
had beaten up a large Chinese gentleman.

704
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,227
Not Chinese, dear. Korean.
At least I think he was Korean.

705
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,690
A very large Korean gentleman.
But that you were a pretty solid type,

706
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,651
according to Washington,
with whom they'd checked.

707
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,864
I figured if they went to the trouble
to contact George Washington,

708
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:53,034
you must be
somebody very important indeed.

709
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,829
I must say, it was rather sweet
of the general, with you only a major.

710
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,998
I didn't even know you knew him.

711
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:05,755
If they were the tiniest bit puzzled
about you, they could have asked me.

712
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,466
Oh, yes, indeed, my darling Ben.

713
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:13,054
They could have asked me,
and I would have told them.

714
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,066
- Hi, kid.
- What in the hell's going on?

715
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:29,278
They called me to say you broke into
my apartment and beat up my houseboy.

716
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,077
Yeah, well...

717
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,246
- You see, Chunjin...
- My God, you look terrible.

718
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,625
I mean, I've never
seen you look so awful.

719
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,251
Yeah...

720
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,936
Raymond...

721
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,650
I wanna tell you that I've been
having this terrible nightmare.

722
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:25,418
I've been in the Army 19 years.
First time I've ever seen one of these.

723
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,301
I've been having this nightmare.

724
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,139
A real swinger of a nightmare, too.

725
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,643
It's to do with...
all kinds of strange people.

726
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,813
Is it about a Russian general
and some Chinese

727
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,399
and me and the men
who were on the patrol?

728
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,611
How did you know that?
How do you know?!

729
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,114
Take your hands off me.

730
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:02,413
Please, Raymond.
Tell me, how did you know?

731
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,291
I don't really know
anything about it at all.

732
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,001
But you just started to tell me...

733
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,129
Do you remember Al Melvin,
the corporal on the patrol?

734
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:13,674
- Yes, of course.
- I had a letter from him two weeks ago.

735
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,844
Needless to say,
I was very surprised to hear from him.

736
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:19,847
You know how much
the guys in the outfit hated me.

737
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,640
Well, not as much as I hated them.

738
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,685
Well, anyway, the funny thing was,

739
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:28,981
he wrote that I was the best friend
he had in the Army.

740
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,984
I was the best friend he had
in the Army.

741
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:36,030
The poor, simple boob. Anyway, he
wanted to tell me about his nightmare.

742
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,783
He said he was going out of his mind.

743
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,829
Raymond... tell me what
he said about the nightmare.

744
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,792
He keeps dreaming that the patrol is all
sitting together in this hotel lobby

745
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,170
with a lot of Chinese brass
and Russian generals.

746
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,090
Anyway, what's so much
of a nightmare about that?

747
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,884
The letter. Have you got the letter?

748
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,386
No, I don't. I never keep letters.

749
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,723
That's all he wrote?
That was the end of it?

750
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,267
Why? Is it the same thing
you've been dreaming?

751
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,895
Raymond, do something for me, will you?

752
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:12,900
Call Eldorado 59970.
If a young lady answers,

753
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,611
tell her I've gone to Washington.
The town, not the general.

754
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,072
I'll be in touch with her
as quickly as I can.

755
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,742
You'll do that, won't you?
Eldorado 59970.

756
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:33,212
(man) To take some of the mystery out
of it, Major, the photographs you see

757
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,258
are shots of male models,
Mexican circus performers,

758
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,552
Czech research chemists,

759
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,470
Japanese criminals,

760
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,932
French head waiters, Turkish wrestlers,

761
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,767
pastoral psychiatrists.

762
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:49,770
And, of course,
various officials of the USSR,

763
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:54,817
the People's Republic of China
and the Soviet Army.

764
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,238
Hold the one on the right, please!

765
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,462
Hold this one, too, please.

766
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:24,305
Exactly one hour ago, your friend
Mr. Alan Melvin in Wainright, Alaska

767
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,140
made the same two photographs.

768
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,313
This one here wore sunglasses,
smelt like a goat.

769
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,318
His moustache was a little thinner then.

770
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:42,573
He had a loud voice and it grated.
He was about 5'11", on the heavy side.

771
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,492
Uniformed as a lieutenant general.

772
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,788
His staff were dressed in civilian
clothes. They looked like FBI men.

773
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:54,335
His name is Berezovo.
He's a member of the Central Committee.

774
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:59,173
This one wore civilian clothes,
but his staff was uniformed,

775
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,676
varying from a full colonel
to a first lieutenant.

776
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,512
- They wore political markings.
- Lights.

777
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,688
All right, Ben.

778
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:19,610
I'm going to recommend setting up
a joint intelligence CIA/FBI unit,

779
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,403
based out of New York.

780
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,156
You'll work with them,
representing the Army.

781
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,117
- Your assignment's Raymond Shaw.
- Very good, Colonel.

782
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,453
It should be a pleasant assignment,

783
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:33,374
considering that Raymond Shaw
is the kindest,

784
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:38,087
bravest, warmest, most wonderful
human being you've ever met.

785
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:45,386
(slurring) My mother, Ben,
is a terrible woman.

786
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:49,306
A terrible, terrible woman.

787
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,647
Chunjin! Chunjin!

788
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,358
We would like some more wine.

789
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:03,487
Chunjin! Oh, I forgot.

790
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:08,450
After you called,
I gave Chunjin the night off,

791
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,453
because it was Christmas Eve,
I told him.

792
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,915
He was very reluctant to go.

793
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,419
That's probably because he's a Buddhist
and he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

794
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,837
Ah-ah.

795
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:24,008
I don't think that Chunjin
is a Buddhist.

796
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,385
He smiles all the time.

797
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,637
Oh, what a shame.

798
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:33,183
I thought he was a Buddhist, or I would
have sent him a Christmas card.

799
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,602
But I figured...

800
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,607
...that if I sent him a card
at this time of the year...

801
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:46,989
...that he would have to send me
a card on the Buddha's birthday.

802
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,991
- To save face, right?
- Oh, right.

803
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,494
- That would've started a big megillah.
- Exactly.

804
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,749
That's... You did exactly
the right thing.

805
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,625
# Two turtle doves

806
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,003
# And a partridge in a pear tree...

807
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:05,299
12 days of Christmas.

808
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,302
One day of Christmas
is loathsome enough.

809
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,636
(music stops)

810
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,265
What were we saying?
Oh, yes. My mother.

811
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,477
But you don't want to sit there
listening to me talking...

812
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,313
Of course I do. I'm interested.

813
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:24,818
It's rather like listening to
Orestes gripe about Clytemnestra.

814
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:28,489
- Who?
- Greeks. A couple of Greeks in a play.

815
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:33,660
Well, you know, Ben, it's a
terrible thing to hate your mother.

816
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,413
But I didn't always hate her.

817
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:40,793
When I was a child,
I only kind of disliked her.

818
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:45,339
But after what she did to Jocie and me,

819
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:48,634
that's when I began to hate her.

820
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:52,638
- Jocie?
- Jocie Jordan.

821
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,433
Senator Jordan's daughter. (low chuckle)

822
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,478
That's pretty funny, isn't it?

823
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,526
Thomas Jordan's daughter...

824
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,072
...and Johnny Iselin's stepson.

825
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,162
That's her.

826
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,791
Jocie.

827
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:26,296
- She's lovely.
- I always keep her picture.

828
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,681
Years later, I realized, Ben, that...

829
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,393
...I'm not very loveable.
No, no. Don't contradict me.

830
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,562
I am not loveable.

831
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:45,607
Some people are loveable
and other people are not loveable.

832
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,444
I am not loveable.

833
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,575
Oh, but I was very loveable with Jocie.

834
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,745
Ben, you cannot believe
how loveable I was.

835
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,456
In a way.

836
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,085
Then, of course,
my mother fixed all that.

837
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,258
Ben, you don't blame me
for hating my mother, do you?

838
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,719
I'm not making excuses.

839
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,347
But I have been even less loveable

840
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:21,101
than I was... since.

841
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,816
It was the summer,
just before I went into the Army,

842
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,069
and I was bitten by this snake.

843
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,200
- Are you following me?
- I am.

844
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,369
Well... while I was lying there,

845
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,706
absolutely helpless, afraid to move...

846
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,459
Because you're not supposed to move.

847
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:49,213
It makes the poison circulate.

848
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:56,303
When, unexpectedly, there she was,

849
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,805
with a razor blade in her hand.

850
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,475
My daddy's gonna be
so pleased about this!

851
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:05,312
He's absolutely scared tiddly about
snakes in this part of the country.

852
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,816
I know that sounds terribly Freudian,
but in this case, I don't think it is.

853
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,360
I mean, I think he's just

854
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,779
uncomplicatedly afraid
of snakes. Period.

855
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,823
Which is why I happen
to be riding around with a razor blade

856
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,661
and a bottle of potassium
permanganate solution.

857
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,288
You don't happen to have a handkerchief?

858
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:27,334
Oh, no. Of course you don't!
Well, I don't either.

859
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,170
I do have a Kleenex, but...

860
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,588
Oh, well.

861
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:36,051
Seriously, Daddy is going
to be just thrilled about this.

862
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,681
All summer long,
he's been raving about snakes,

863
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,892
and nobody's even seen one,
and now this.

864
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,728
I promise you one thing. It may be
a little uncomfortable for you,

865
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,439
but it's gonna absolutely
make his summer!

866
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,984
Now, you just lie very still.
Don't move.

867
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:55,529
That's very important.
I'll be back with the car in a minute.

868
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,541
You're lucky, young man. Very lucky!

869
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:12,462
If I were to tell you the statistics
on death by snakebite every year...

870
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,049
But in this case, I think...

871
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,927
There's no swelling above or below.

872
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,138
Hmm...

873
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,354
Normal.

874
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,399
Well, I must say, there's
a good chance you're going to live.

875
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,280
You are not by any chance
a mute, are you?

876
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,740
(giggling)

877
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,578
- (quietly) No, sir.
- Well...

878
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,831
I want to thank you very much, Miss...?

879
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,751
- Jordan.
- Miss Jocelyn Jordan.

880
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,754
- How do you do?
- Hi.

881
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:58,925
And now, according to
the quaint local custom,

882
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,345
it's your turn
to tell us what your name is.

883
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,514
- My name is Raymond Shaw, sir.
- How do you do, Raymond?

884
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,475
Is your place near here, Raymond?

885
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:09,561
Yes. It's that red house
just across the lake.

886
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,439
- The Iselin house?
- My house.

887
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,442
It was my father's.
My father's dead. He left it to me.

888
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:19,488
We were told that that was
the summer camp of Senator Iselin.

889
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,115
Johnny stays there sometimes, sir,

890
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:25,494
when he gets too drunk for Mother
to allow him to be seen in Washington.

891
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,958
My dear, although we've done everything
that modern science recommends,

892
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,170
there is still the traditional
folk remedy against snakebite,

893
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:39,633
which we haven't applied.
So, to be on the safe side...

894
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,682
- Mrs. Iselin is your mother?
- Yes, sir.

895
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,645
I once found it necessary
to sue your mother

896
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,440
for defamation of character and slander.

897
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,903
My name is Thomas Jordan.
Senator Thomas Jordan.

898
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:05,075
- The Communist?
- Well...

899
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,577
One of your mother's
more endearing traits

900
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:13,709
is a tendency to refer to anyone
who disagrees with her as a Communist.

901
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:18,046
The last time she so referred to me,
on a network radio program,

902
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:22,843
it cost her $65,000 and court costs.

903
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,346
What hurt her more than the money,
I think,

904
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,683
was the fact that I donated
all of it to an organization

905
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,853
called the American
Civil Liberties Union.

906
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,276
- Senator Jordan.
- Yes, Raymond?

907
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:44,531
I would very much like to ask
your permission, sir, to marry Jocelyn.

908
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,289
(laughing continues)

909
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,595
...together every minute after that.

910
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:13,810
You just cannot believe, Ben, how...

911
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,646
...loveable the whole damn thing was.

912
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,651
All summer long, we were together.

913
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,530
I was loveable.

914
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,075
Jocie was loveable.

915
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,329
The senator was loveable.

916
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,332
The days were loveable,
the nights were loveable.

917
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,337
And everybody was loveable.

918
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,550
Except, of course...

919
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,885
...my mother.

920
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:50,472
- (door opening, closing)
- Raymond?

921
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,560
What is it, Mother?

922
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,021
What sort of a greeting
is that at 3:30am?

923
01:11:58,189 --> 01:11:59,606
It's a quarter to three.
What do you want?

924
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:03,944
- I want to talk to you, Raymond.
- About what?

925
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,196
I want to talk to you
about that Communist tart.

926
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:07,948
Shut up with that, Mother! Shut up!

927
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,951
You know what Jordan is.
Are you out to crucify me?

928
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,703
I don't know what you mean,
and I don't want to know.

929
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:17,165
- I'm going to bed.
- Raymond. Sit down.

930
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:31,054
How would you see her?
They live in New York.

931
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:35,058
- I'm getting a job in New York.
- You have your Army service.

932
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:39,104
Next spring.
I might be dead by next spring.

933
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:42,107
Raymond. If we were at war,

934
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:46,403
and you were to become infatuated
with the daughter of a Russian agent,

935
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:49,114
wouldn't you expect me
to come to you and object,

936
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:52,826
and beg you to stop the entire thing
before it was too late?

937
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:56,329
Well, we are at war. It's a cold war.

938
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,331
But it will get worse and worse,

939
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,794
until every citizen in this country
will have to stand up and be counted

940
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:05,672
to say whether they are
on the side of right and freedom

941
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,009
or on the side of
the Thomas Jordans of this country.

942
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:12,178
I will go with you to Washington,
tomorrow, if you like,

943
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:17,017
and I will show you proof that this man
stands for evil, that he is evil.

944
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,853
That his whole life
is devoted to undermining

945
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,647
everything that you and I
and every freedom-minded American...

946
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,190
(whimpering)

947
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,234
She won, of course.

948
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,196
She always does.

949
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,240
I could never beat her.

950
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,661
I still can't.

951
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,667
I wrote a letter...

952
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,797
Or she wrote it and I signed it,
I can't even remember which.

953
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:55,513
It was a terrible, vile,
disgusting letter.

954
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,730
The next day I enlisted in the Army.

955
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:10,153
I never saw her again.

956
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,698
God knows, Ben, I...

957
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:19,871
I'm not loveable, but I loved her.

958
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:26,086
I did love her.
(sobbing) I do love her.

959
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:37,305
Come on, kid.
It's time for you to call it a night.

960
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,723
Come on.

961
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,980
(man) So this lousy
brother-in-law of mine,

962
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:48,817
I say to him,
"You think you're a poker player?

963
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,444
- You ain't no poker player."
- Beer, please.

964
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:56,533
So I says to him "My advice to you,

965
01:14:56,701 --> 01:15:01,246
from the bottom of the heart:
don't play poker.

966
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:07,210
If I was you,
I'd get myself another line of action.

967
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:12,340
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?"

968
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,968
Give me a deck of cards, please.

969
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,729
(barman) When I get married
to my old lady,

970
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:29,816
I got no idea that this guy
comes in the same package,

971
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:33,695
that it's a package deal,
and for 11 long years,

972
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,823
I got this crumb tied around my neck.

973
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:40,952
And, believe me, it's no bargain.
You got no idea...

974
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,829
- Beer, please.
- (chatter continues)

975
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:46,166
Sorry I'm late, kid.
Got held up in traffic, you know.

976
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:51,546
So I says to him, "Do me a favor.
Why don't you go and take yourself a cab

977
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:55,967
and go up to Central Park
and go jump in the lake?"

978
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,844
(group laughing)

979
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,640
Hey! Raymond! Hey!

980
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,982
Raymond!

981
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,034
Get out of there!

982
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,163
What are you doing?!

983
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:54,627
- Hi, Ben.
- What's the matter with you?

984
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,379
I don't know.

985
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,551
I was with you at the bar and you were
playing solitaire. Do you remember that?

986
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:09,350
You bolted out, jumped in a cab,
drove here and jumped into the water!

987
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,313
I don't remember, Ben.
I just don't remember.

988
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,942
Wait a minute. I do. I remember.

989
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:22,822
In the dream... I remember
what you were doing with your hands.

990
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:27,160
You were... Of course!

991
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:34,209
Obviously, the solitaire game serves
as some kind of trigger mechanism.

992
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,544
Black seven on the red eight.

993
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:43,676
Let's discard the various number systems
and concentrate on the face cards.

994
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,221
- Red six on the black seven.
- Thanks a lot.

995
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,849
Because of their symbolic identification
with human beings.

996
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,976
Based on Raymond's psychiatric pattern,

997
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,896
I think we can safely
eliminate jacks and kings.

998
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:59,692
- Black six on the red seven.
- Why don't you try for a while?

999
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,448
Human fish swimming
in the ocean of atmosphere

1000
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:09,661
develop psychic injuries
as they collide with one another.

1001
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:14,540
Most mortal of all
are those gotten from the parent fish.

1002
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,670
Queen of diamonds on the black king.

1003
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:23,132
Hey! What are you doing?

1004
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,469
- To cheat at solitaire is a form...
- I remember.

1005
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,681
I remember.

1006
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:35,937
I can see that Chinese cat standin'
there smilin' like Fu Manchu,

1007
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:41,985
and saying, "The queen of diamonds
is reminiscent in many ways

1008
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:46,239
of Raymond's dearly loved
and hated mother.

1009
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:51,077
And is the second key
to clear the mechanism

1010
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:55,248
for any other assignment." Yeah!

1011
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,961
(Johnny) ...of the Republic,
repeat Republic,

1012
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:03,089
until the peril
of international Communism

1013
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:07,635
is driven from every dark corner
of this great nation.

1014
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,263
Jimmy, a little chalky under the chin.

1015
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:13,182
Hon, I can't tell you
how worried I am about Raymond.

1016
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,021
- Raymond? What Raymond?
- Raymond Shaw, my son. Your stepson.

1017
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:21,399
I've been thinking about him a
great deal lately, and you know what?

1018
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:25,445
- I've decided it's time he got married.
- (chuckling)

1019
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,364
May I ask what you find so amusing?

1020
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:32,452
Who could you possibly find
who would marry Raymond?

1021
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,621
I have devoted considerable thought
to the problem,

1022
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:39,500
and it has occurred to me
that Tom Jordan's daughter, Jocelyn...

1023
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,253
You remember her?
That mousy little girl

1024
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,964
Raymond was so attracted
to that summer at the lake.

1025
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:48,885
- Yeah. That little... Communist tart?
- All right!

1026
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,096
- I was a bit hasty.
- Same with the hairline.

1027
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,850
Times change. I now think she would
make Raymond an excellent wife.

1028
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,603
She's been living in Paris
for the past two years.

1029
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,646
I have word she'll be coming home soon,

1030
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:04,484
and when she does,
I think we should give a little party.

1031
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:07,820
But, babe,
I thought that you and Senator...

1032
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,157
I keep telling you not to think!

1033
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:13,493
You're very, very good
at a great many things,

1034
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,996
but thinking, hon,
just simply isn't one of them.

1035
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:21,292
Just keep shouting "point of order"
into the television cameras,

1036
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,087
- and I will handle the rest.
- Jimmy.

1037
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,215
- Bourbon. Water.
- I think a June wedding would be nice.

1038
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:30,468
Right before the convention. (sighing)

1039
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:36,808
Why is yours the only apartment in New
York City without an air conditioner?

1040
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:40,019
Sometimes I think you came to us
from another century.

1041
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,438
Chu Chin Chow,
or whatever your name is,

1042
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:46,776
the steaks are to be broiled
for exactly 11 minutes on each side

1043
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:50,530
- in a preheated grill at 400 degrees.
- Yes, ma'am.

1044
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,365
- Raymond.
- Mother.

1045
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,868
- May I ask a question?
- Of course.

1046
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,246
What are you doing here?

1047
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:02,208
- Why are we having our annual meeting?
- I don't know what you mean.

1048
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,836
When you announced
you were coming to lunch,

1049
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,505
I naturally assumed
you wanted something.

1050
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,049
Not at all.
This is a purely social event.

1051
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,928
- However...
- Ah! The however.

1052
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:15,430
As you may or may not have heard,

1053
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,057
Johnny and I are giving
an enormous party.

1054
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:21,769
A costume ball, actually,
at the summer house on Long Island.

1055
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,772
I wondered if you'd like to attend.

1056
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,109
Have you gone out of your mind?

1057
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:32,905
The reason I ask is because it's
in honor of an old friend of yours,

1058
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,242
- and her father.
- What old friend?

1059
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:40,621
Do you remember a darling girl
we met before you went into the Army,

1060
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,624
Jocelyn Jordan,
Senator Jordan's daughter?

1061
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,461
She's been abroad for several years.

1062
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,922
She arrived back in New York
a week or so ago.

1063
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:54,760
And I thought, considering
the rather shabby way you treated her,

1064
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:59,432
it might be a rather gracious gesture
if I gave her a coming-home party.

1065
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,144
Jocie and her father?

1066
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,106
Coming to a party of yours?

1067
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:10,610
Of course. Once I explained
to her you would be there.

1068
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:16,574
- (band plays ragtime)
- (indistinct chattering)

1069
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,787
- It's all right, it's Polish caviar.
- (laughing)

1070
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,874
(Mother) Johnny, come over here, hon.

1071
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:32,715
You stand in the middle.

1072
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:38,387
- Great.
- Thank you. See you later.

1073
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:46,479
- Where is she? Have they come?
- They'll be here any minute.

1074
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:48,814
Are you sure they're coming, Mother?

1075
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,858
Oh, Raymond, don't be such a jerk.

1076
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,945
Go and get yourself
a drink or a tranquillizer.

1077
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:58,115
- Raymond can certainly be a royal pain.
- She's just kiddin'.

1078
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,327
Ray, you look great!
You look just great.

1079
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:04,372
What are you supposed to be?
One of those Dutch skaters?

1080
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,458
- (laughter)
- Raymond, darling!

1081
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,420
Raymond, dear.
Why do you always look as if

1082
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,839
your head is about to come to a point?

1083
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:18,678
Now, just be patient.
She'll be here. I guarantee it.

1084
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:24,016
Raymond, why don't we just
sneak away for a few minutes,

1085
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,394
sit down somewhere quietly
and have a drink?

1086
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,148
(low, indistinct chattering)

1087
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:41,826
- Mother. Mother, how did she sound?
- (chuckles) Like a girl!

1088
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:47,206
Raymond... why don't you pass the time

1089
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,250
by playing a little solitaire?

1090
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:53,546
- Tom!
- (music continues)

1091
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:59,719
Tom, boy! So great you could come!

1092
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:03,014
I am here at this Fascist rally

1093
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:08,102
because my daughter has assured me that
it was important to her that I come.

1094
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:13,065
- There is no other reason.
- (chuckling) Good old Tom!

1095
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:23,701
Raymond. The time has come for us
to have a serious discussion.

1096
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,705
- We feel... What is it?!
- (knocking at door)

1097
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,791
(Johnny) It's me, babe. Johnny.
Tom Jordan's here. I need you.

1098
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,501
I'll be right out!

1099
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,296
- Who's in there with you, anyway?
- Raymond.

1100
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:39,050
Hurry it up, will you?
We've got work to do out here.

1101
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,930
I'll take this one with me, dear.

1102
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:49,018
- It might bring mischief if I leave it.
- Yes, Mother.

1103
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,857
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1104
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,946
(party music continues in distance)

1105
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:14,418
I've been watching you
through the window.

1106
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:18,130
When I saw you,
my heart almost shot out of my body.

1107
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:22,843
I sent Daddy round the front way.
I had to see you alone.

1108
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:29,975
Jocie...

1109
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,478
- (song ends)
- (light applause)

1110
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,563
Oh, Jocie...

1111
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,910
- (band plays)
- (indistinct chatter)

1112
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,330
- Hey!
- (applause)

1113
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:06,345
(laughter)

1114
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:14,186
That was cute! Come on, lover!

1115
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:19,066
Now, why don't you just take that
somewhere very quietly and drink it?

1116
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,609
But, babe, I...

1117
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:24,572
All right, dear. Run along.
The grownups have to talk.

1118
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,249
How good of you to come, Tom.

1119
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:38,335
I have explained to your husband
why I am here.

1120
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:43,591
Tom, I know you have very strong
personal feelings about Johnny and me.

1121
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:47,303
What I would like to find out
is how strong they really are.

1122
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:49,638
To put it as simply as possible,

1123
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,558
if Johnny's name were proposed
at the convention next week,

1124
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:54,894
would you attempt to block him?

1125
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:59,648
- You're joking, of course.
- Mr. Stevenson makes jokes. I do not.

1126
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:02,401
You're seriously trying
for the nomination for Johnny?

1127
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,737
No. We couldn't make it.

1128
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:07,740
But I think he has a good chance
for the second spot.

1129
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,910
I've answered your question,
but you haven't answered mine.

1130
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,496
- What question?
- Will you block us?

1131
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,000
Will I block you?

1132
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:24,548
I would spend every cent I own
and all I could borrow to block you.

1133
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,721
There are people who think of Johnny
as a clown and a buffoon.

1134
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,973
But I do not.

1135
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,226
I despise John Iselin

1136
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:39,271
and everything that Iselinism
has come to stand for.

1137
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,775
I think if John Iselin
were a paid Soviet agent,

1138
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:46,612
he could not do more to harm
this country than he's doing now.

1139
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:52,451
You asked me a question.
Very well, I'll answer you.

1140
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:55,955
If you attempt to deal
with the delegates,

1141
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:59,667
or cause Johnny's name
to be brought forward on the ticket,

1142
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:03,087
or if in my canvass of the delegates
tomorrow by telephone

1143
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,673
I find that you are so acting,

1144
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,926
I will bring impeachment proceedings
against your husband

1145
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:11,804
on the floor of the
United States Senate.

1146
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:14,473
And I will hit him, I promise you,

1147
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:18,727
with everything
in my well-documented book.

1148
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,148
(retreating footsteps)

1149
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,669
For one million bucks... pick a card.

1150
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:47,840
- Bennie, card tricks. If I'd known...
- Oh, come on, pick a card.

1151
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,762
Queen of diamonds.

1152
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,892
That's pretty good. How did you do that?

1153
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:03,063
This is what is known,
my dear girl, as a forced deck.

1154
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:07,526
This deck of cards is often employed
by a professional magician

1155
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:12,197
to simplify his problem of guessing
the card picked by the little old lady,

1156
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:16,035
also employed by
Army intelligence officers who...

1157
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:18,871
- Rosie. Let's get married.
- Hmm.

1158
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,207
We certainly are in
good spirits tonight.

1159
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,794
Yes, we are. Tomorrow's the big day.

1160
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,547
Lunch with Raymond,
a nice little game of solitaire

1161
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:32,217
and a nice long chat
about the good old days in Korea

1162
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:36,305
and some old Chinese
and Russian friends of ours.

1163
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,559
Then a suggestion or two
that will rip out all of the wiring...

1164
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,897
...and then, dear girl, it's over.
All over.

1165
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,483
- What's the matter? Don't you want to?
- Want to what?

1166
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:50,986
Get married. Why don't you pay
attention to me when I speak to you?

1167
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:55,407
Bennie, I want to marry you more than
I want to go on eating Italian food,

1168
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,160
which will give you some idea.

1169
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,914
Then why don't we get with it, kiddo?

1170
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:06,043
You know, arranging for the papers,
for the blood tests, posting the bans.

1171
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:08,462
Figure out
what we're gonna name the kids.

1172
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,423
Renting the rice,
buy the ring, call the folks.

1173
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:15,427
- Folks?
- You neither? Orphan?

1174
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:20,099
I used to believe that as a baby, I was
the sole survivor of a spaceship crash.

1175
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:23,811
Very sexy stuff. Very, very sexy.

1176
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:32,695
(door closing)

1177
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,617
- Ben!
- Hello, Raymond.

1178
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:40,869
Ben, I want...

1179
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:43,914
I want you to meet Jocie.
Remember I told you about her?

1180
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:46,041
This is my friend, Major Ben Marco.

1181
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:47,835
- Miss Jordan.
- How do you do, Major?

1182
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:51,964
Only it's Mrs. Shaw now.
Mrs. Raymond Shaw.

1183
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:56,677
(Raymond) We flew to Maryland last
night. We got married. We just got back.

1184
01:31:56,845 --> 01:32:00,556
Aren't you gonna pop champagne?
Or at least kiss the bride?

1185
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:02,099
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1186
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:05,269
My God, Ben.
Isn't she beautiful? Isn't she?

1187
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:07,896
And am I not the luckiest guy
in the whole world?

1188
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,483
(chuckles) You don't have to answer
that! Anyway, I'm the lucky one.

1189
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:12,860
Raymond...

1190
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:16,864
There must be some beer
or champagne or eye drops

1191
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,950
or some anchovies in the icebox.
Crack open whatever it is.

1192
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,287
The three of us must have a drink.
Come on, bustle.

1193
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:26,290
Make like a housewife!
I'll get out of this idiot suit.

1194
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,001
Ben! Ben, you should have seen
the judge's face!

1195
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,295
There we were,
the queen of diamonds and me,

1196
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,006
looking like, I dunno, Gaucho Marx.

1197
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:41,680
Gaucho Marx.
Ben... Ben, I just made a joke.

1198
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:44,224
Not a very good joke,
I admit, but a joke.

1199
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,144
In all the years that you've known me,
have you ever heard me make a joke?

1200
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:51,356
Well, I just made one.
Gaucho Marx. Me! Ha!

1201
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:53,358
Big day! Mark that down in your book.

1202
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:56,945
Raymond Shaw got married
and he made a joke.

1203
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,781
Gaucho Marx.

1204
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:08,373
Queen of diamonds. What did he mean,
the queen of diamonds?

1205
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:11,919
My costume. I came to this costume
party as the queen of diamonds.

1206
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,089
I couldn't think what to wear,
then I saw this playing card...

1207
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:18,675
- Mrs. Shaw...
- Oh, please, Major. Jocie.

1208
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:22,930
- You call me Jocie, I'll call you Ben.
- Mrs. Shaw. Jocie.

1209
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:28,227
The reason I came here is to ask Raymond
to voluntarily put himself under arrest.

1210
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,896
- What?
- Maybe not under arrest.

1211
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,940
That's pretty strong.

1212
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,442
To surrender himself
for some questioning.

1213
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,237
Questioning? What kind of questioning?

1214
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:44,076
Raymond is sick, Mrs. Shaw,
in a kind of a special way.

1215
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:47,204
- He doesn't even realize it himself.
- Sick? He's not sick!

1216
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:51,208
He's the healthiest man I've ever seen.
You can tell by just looking at him.

1217
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:55,087
That's not the kind of sick I mean.

1218
01:33:56,464 --> 01:34:00,425
Well, you're wrong, Ben. You're wrong.

1219
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:03,762
He's tied up inside in
a thousand knots, I know that,

1220
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,932
but you can see for yourself
how he is with me.

1221
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,685
Oh, God.

1222
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:21,655
Ben.

1223
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:24,241
We were married just six hours ago.

1224
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:28,704
We've been in cars and offices
and airplanes ever since.

1225
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:34,918
What were your... What are your plans?

1226
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:38,130
There's an inn, the Bedford House,
near Bedford village.

1227
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:40,090
It's about an hour from here.

1228
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:44,970
There's hardly anyone there this early
in the season. We've wired for a room.

1229
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:50,601
Ben, you've got to believe me
and trust me. I can make him well.

1230
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,062
I'll give you 48 hours.

1231
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,523
Have him back here
the day after tomorrow.

1232
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,151
I'll talk to him then.

1233
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,279
After that, we'll see.

1234
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:06,867
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you and God bless you.

1235
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:17,502
Darling.

1236
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:30,766
- (whispering) Yes?
- Nothing.

1237
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,809
Just... darling.

1238
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:53,538
My dear girl. Have you noticed
that the human race is divided

1239
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,708
into two distinct
and irreconcilable groups?

1240
01:35:56,876 --> 01:36:00,837
Those who walk into rooms and
automatically turn televisions on,

1241
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:03,548
and those who walk in
and automatically turn them off.

1242
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:04,716
(chuckling)

1243
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:07,678
The problem is,
they usually marry each other,

1244
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:09,805
which naturally causes a great deal...

1245
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:13,558
...Senator Thomas Jordan
and Korean War hero Raymond Shaw,

1246
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,602
stepson of Senator John Iselin.

1247
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,855
It appears that this
Montague-Capulet note

1248
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,691
would have little effect
on the feud

1249
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,235
now raging between
the two party leaders.

1250
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:27,322
Earlier, Senator Iselin
stepped up his charges

1251
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:30,325
against the leader of the group,
attempting to block his nomination.

1252
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:35,747
I now charge this man,
Thomas Jordan, with high treason.

1253
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:39,876
And, I assure you,
the moment the Senate reconvenes,

1254
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:43,630
I shall move
for this man Jordan's impeachment!

1255
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,758
And after that, a civil trial...

1256
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:49,136
Come on. Get dressed.

1257
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:52,139
We're driving to New York.
Go to your father's house.

1258
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:54,808
Convey my apologies to him.
I'll join you later.

1259
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:57,436
- What are you going to do?
- (chatter continues on TV)

1260
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:01,481
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

1261
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:06,528
I'm gonna beat that vile, slandering
son of a numbskull to a bloody pulp!

1262
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,908
Mother!

1263
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:15,787
(Raymond) That vile, slandering husband
of yours! Where is he?

1264
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,832
(Mother) Darling, something
important has come up.

1265
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,584
There is something you have to do.

1266
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:41,229
- (door slams)
- Who is it?

1267
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:46,485
- It's me, sir.
- Raymond, my boy!

1268
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:52,991
Jocie waited up as long as she could.
She turned in about a quarter to two.

1269
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:56,161
- She told me the good news. Raymond.
- Yes, sir?

1270
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:59,873
I want to offer my congratulations
and welcome you to the family.

1271
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,584
I've been watching
my daughter's face all evening.

1272
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:05,712
- She's a very happy girl.
- Thank you, sir.

1273
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,673
Come with me!
I'll force some good whisky on you

1274
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:09,966
to celebrate your wedding,

1275
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,095
soothe you after a trying day,
any number of reasons.

1276
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:16,890
There's some whisky in that cabinet.
Help yourself.

1277
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:21,853
I hope you haven't been too much upset
by these idiotic attacks of Iselin.

1278
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:25,690
Actually, I take the position that
any attack by Iselin is a great honor.

1279
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:30,278
I haven't had so much supporting mail
in the Senate in the last 22 years.

1280
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,740
I'm very glad to hear that, sir.

1281
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:39,830
- What the hell is that in your hand?
- It's a pistol, sir.

1282
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:44,000
- Is that a silencer?
- Yes, sir.

1283
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,837
Why are you carrying a pistol?

1284
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:49,965
- Raymond...
- (muffled shot)

1285
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:00,976
Daddy, what is it?

1286
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:04,563
- (muffled shot)
- Raymond, no! Raymond, darling!

1287
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:33,341
(door closing)

1288
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,453
Ben?

1289
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:14,799
Ben! What is it?

1290
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:18,720
Raymond Shaw shot and killed his wife
early this morning.

1291
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:28,980
- But it doesn't say...
- I know.

1292
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:32,609
It wasn't Raymond that really did it.

1293
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:36,488
In a way, it was me.

1294
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:41,368
As you can well understand,
gentlemen, my...

1295
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:45,830
...my wife is prostrate over the loss
of this dear and wonderful girl

1296
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:50,085
- whom she loved as a daughter.
- Your stepson, Senator, where is he?

1297
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:54,047
My... My son Raymond is in retreat,

1298
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:57,467
praying for strength and understanding

1299
01:40:57,635 --> 01:41:00,720
to try and carry on somehow.

1300
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:03,848
(phone ringing)

1301
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:08,103
- (indistinct chatter)
- Ben! It's for you.

1302
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,403
Major Marco.

1303
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,199
- Ben.
- Hi, kid.

1304
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:25,662
(voice wavering)
How could anyone... Jocie.

1305
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:30,000
- (Raymond) How could it happen?
- Where are you, Raymond?

1306
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:35,213
I... I think maybe I'm going crazy.

1307
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:39,843
I'm having... terrible dreams
like you used to have and...

1308
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:44,222
Where are you? We can't talk on the
telephone. Just tell me where you are.

1309
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,057
(stammering)

1310
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:50,270
I'm in a... hotel room...

1311
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,397
...across from the Garden.

1312
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,108
Eighth Avenue side.

1313
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,279
Room four.

1314
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,740
All right. Listen to me.
Just wait right there.

1315
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:04,784
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Don't move!

1316
01:42:06,495 --> 01:42:10,332
OK, I'll take him now.
Everything's got to move quite normally.

1317
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:14,586
Now, I want him to feel like he's safe.
Just give me a pack of cards.

1318
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:21,176
They've handed the vice-presidential
nomination to that idiot Iselin.

1319
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:22,802
Oh...

1320
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,487
Hi, kid.

1321
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:47,160
Who killed... Jocie, Ben?

1322
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:51,206
Tell me. I... I've got to know.

1323
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:10,809
How about passing the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1324
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:25,532
All right, now let's start
unlocking a few doors.

1325
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,992
Let's begin with the patrol.

1326
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:32,288
You didn't save our lives and take out
an enemy company, or anything like that.

1327
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,792
- Did you, Raymond? Did you?
- No.

1328
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,294
What happened?

1329
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:42,590
Patrol was taken
by a Russian airborne unit

1330
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:45,760
and flown by helicopter

1331
01:43:45,928 --> 01:43:49,723
across the Manchurian border
to a place called Tonghua.

1332
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:54,102
We were worked on for three days

1333
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:58,732
by a team of specialists
from the Pavlov Institute in Moscow.

1334
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:04,362
They developed a technique for
descent into the unconscious mind,

1335
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:06,573
part light-induced, part drug.

1336
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:11,077
Never mind all that. Not now.
Tell me what else happened at Tonghua.

1337
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:15,039
We were drilled for three days.

1338
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:19,544
We were made to memorize
the details of the imaginary action.

1339
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,712
What else?

1340
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:32,390
And I strangled Ed Mavole...
and shot Bobby Lembeck.

1341
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:37,729
One red queen works pretty good.

1342
01:44:37,897 --> 01:44:41,316
Let's see what we get with two of 'em.
Keep playing.

1343
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,750
Then I killed Mr. Gaines.

1344
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:03,421
It was just a test.

1345
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:05,965
It didn't matter who I killed.

1346
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:09,177
They picked him to see
if all the linkages still worked

1347
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:12,597
before they turned me over
to my American operator.

1348
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:20,104
And that business about jumping
in the lake, it really did happen.

1349
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,817
It was an accident.

1350
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:27,487
Something somebody said in the bar
accidentally triggered it.

1351
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:28,780
Keep playing!

1352
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:43,336
Then I... killed Senator Jordan.

1353
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,757
And after that...

1354
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:54,347
Forget everything that happened at the
senator's house, do you understand?

1355
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:56,599
You'll only remember it
when I tell you so.

1356
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:59,269
You forget about it, do you understand?

1357
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:04,148
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Raymond...

1358
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,818
Now, the big one.

1359
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:11,656
Why... Why is all of this being done?

1360
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:13,741
What have they built you to do?

1361
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:17,161
I don't know.

1362
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,502
I don't think anybody
really knows, except...

1363
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:30,216
...Berezovo in Moscow,
and my American operator here.

1364
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:35,346
But, whatever it is,
it's supposed to happen soon,

1365
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:38,266
right at the convention.

1366
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:40,143
Maybe...

1367
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,479
I don't know.

1368
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:51,863
They can make me do anything,
Ben, can't they?

1369
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:57,577
- Anything.
- We'll see, kid.

1370
01:46:57,745 --> 01:47:00,288
We'll see what they can do
and we'll see what we can do.

1371
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:08,379
So the red queen is our baby.

1372
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:11,007
Well, take a look at this, kid.

1373
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:14,969
Fifty-two of them.

1374
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:20,850
Take a good look at 'em, Raymond.
And while you're looking, listen.

1375
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:23,561
This is me, Marco, talking.

1376
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:28,191
Fifty-two red queens and me are telling
you... You know what we're telling you?

1377
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:33,071
It's over! The links, the beautifully
conditioned links are smashed.

1378
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,115
They're smashed as of now
because we say so.

1379
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,368
Because we say they are to be smashed!

1380
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:42,872
We're busting up the joint so good,

1381
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,249
all the queen's horses
and all the queen's men

1382
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:49,587
will never put you back together again.
You don't work anymore.

1383
01:47:49,755 --> 01:47:51,297
That's an order.

1384
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,925
Anybody invites you
to a game of solitaire,

1385
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:58,096
you tell 'em, "Sorry, buster.
The ball game is over."

1386
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:01,265
(phone rings)

1387
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:27,083
It's time for my American operator
to give me the plan.

1388
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:32,922
Yes?

1389
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,341
Yes, I understand, Mother.

1390
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:49,897
She wants me to go.
There's a car waiting for me downstairs.

1391
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:54,068
The convention reconvenes at nine
for the acceptance speeches.

1392
01:48:55,112 --> 01:48:57,488
I don't think anything
will happen until then.

1393
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:02,785
- I'd better go now.
- Here's a number.

1394
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:13,254
I've got 500 people at my disposal.
A thousand if I need them.

1395
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:18,134
You call me at that number.
Try to call me by 8:30.

1396
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:22,305
As soon as you find out whatever it is
they want you to do. I'll be waiting.

1397
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,265
Yes, sir.

1398
01:49:26,685 --> 01:49:28,519
Raymond.

1399
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:34,442
Remember, Raymond,
the wires have been pulled.

1400
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:38,571
They can't touch you anymore.
You're free.

1401
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:54,545
It's been decided
that you will be dressed as a priest

1402
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:59,008
to help you get away
in the pandemonium afterwards.

1403
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:01,844
Chunjin will give you
a two-piece sniper's rifle

1404
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:05,473
that fits nicely into a special bag.

1405
01:50:05,641 --> 01:50:09,143
There's a spotlight booth
that won't be in use.

1406
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:13,231
It's up under the roof
on the Eighth Avenue side of the Garden.

1407
01:50:13,398 --> 01:50:16,818
You will have absolutely clear,
protected shooting.

1408
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:25,576
You are to shoot the presidential
nominee through the head,

1409
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:29,539
and Johnny will rise
gallantly to his feet

1410
01:50:29,706 --> 01:50:33,751
and lift Ben Arthur's body in his arms,

1411
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:37,255
stand in front of the microphones
and begin to speak.

1412
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,634
The speech is short.

1413
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:45,304
But it's the most rousing speech
I've ever read.

1414
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:50,351
It's been worked on here and in Russia,
on and off, for over eight years.

1415
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:53,771
I shall force someone
to take the body away from him.

1416
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:57,650
Then Johnny will really hit
those microphones and those cameras,

1417
01:50:57,818 --> 01:51:01,237
with blood all over him,
fighting off anyone who tries to help,

1418
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:04,615
defending America
even if it means his own death!

1419
01:51:04,783 --> 01:51:08,452
Rallying a nation of television viewers
into hysteria,

1420
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:11,122
to sweep us up
into the White House with powers

1421
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:15,459
that will make martial law
seem like anarchy!

1422
01:51:15,627 --> 01:51:18,337
Now, this is very important.

1423
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,842
I want the nominee to be dead
about two minutes

1424
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:25,553
after he begins his acceptance speech,

1425
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:28,472
depending on his reading time
under pressure.

1426
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:33,311
You are to hit him right at the point
that he finishes the phrase,

1427
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:38,441
"Nor would I ask of any fellow American
in defense of his freedom

1428
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:42,653
that which I would not
gladly give myself.

1429
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:46,991
My life before my liberty."

1430
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:50,953
Is that absolutely clear?

1431
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:58,336
Would you repeat it for me, Raymond?

1432
01:51:58,503 --> 01:52:02,089
"Nor would I ask
of any fellow American..."

1433
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:04,926
- "...in defense of his freedom..."
- "...in defense of his freedom..."

1434
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:06,510
"...that which I would not gladly..."

1435
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:07,845
"...that which I would
not gladly give..."

1436
01:52:08,013 --> 01:52:09,847
- "...give myself."
- "...myself."

1437
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:14,602
- "My life before my liberty."
- "My life before my liberty."

1438
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:31,702
I know you will never entirely
comprehend this, Raymond,

1439
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:36,540
but you must believe
I did not know it would be you.

1440
01:52:37,626 --> 01:52:40,795
I served them, I fought for them,

1441
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:45,549
I'm about to win them the greatest
foothold they will ever have here,

1442
01:52:45,717 --> 01:52:51,055
and they paid me back
by taking your soul away from you.

1443
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:54,100
I told them to build me an assassin.

1444
01:52:54,268 --> 01:52:57,228
I wanted a killer
from a world filled with killers,

1445
01:52:57,396 --> 01:52:59,230
and they chose you

1446
01:52:59,398 --> 01:53:03,276
because they thought
it would bind me closer to them.

1447
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:10,283
But now we have come almost to the end.

1448
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,952
One last step,

1449
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:16,872
and then, when I take power,
they will be pulled down

1450
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:21,502
and ground into dirt
for what they did to you,

1451
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:26,382
and what they did in so
contemptuously underestimating me!

1452
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:04,503
(indistinct chatter)

1453
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:12,678
(indistinct chatter over radio)

1454
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:15,806
(man on PA)
One, two, three, four, five...

1455
01:54:15,974 --> 01:54:17,183
(feedback)

1456
01:54:31,073 --> 01:54:34,867
(man) Testing! One, two,
three, four, five, six.

1457
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:21,372
(man) We need the lights. Lights.

1458
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:42,309
(man) Lights out! Lights!

1459
01:56:08,003 --> 01:56:10,379
(Marco) Why hasn't he called?

1460
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:14,175
It was a calculated risk, Ben.
You were right to take it.

1461
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,677
Even if it's not true,
it's nice of you to say it.

1462
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:19,889
(no sound)

1463
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:22,933
- (Marco) The Garden's filling up.
- Take it easy.

1464
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,645
- 8:44.
- I know.

1465
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:36,071
If Steinkamp doesn't take off that hat
and stop messing around,

1466
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:39,116
- I'm gonna bust him into a PFC.
- Easy, Ben.

1467
01:56:43,747 --> 01:56:47,124
OK, Milt, I blew it. I blew it!

1468
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:50,753
My magic is better than your magic.

1469
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:52,838
I should have known better.

1470
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:56,342
Intelligence Officer!
Stupidity Officer is better!

1471
01:56:57,594 --> 01:56:59,803
If the Pentagon ever
opens up a Stupidity Division,

1472
01:56:59,971 --> 01:57:01,931
they know who can lead it.

1473
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:11,106
Well, Raymond was theirs.
He is theirs and he'll always be theirs.

1474
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:14,318
There's time. He may still call.

1475
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:20,950
For money?

1476
01:57:23,495 --> 01:57:25,120
No.

1477
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:28,999
That's what I figured.

1478
01:57:33,255 --> 01:57:35,881
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Let's go!

1479
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:39,677
(siren wails)

1480
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,266
(tires screeching)

1481
01:57:47,477 --> 01:57:49,687
(band plays)

1482
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:56,068
- (band playing in distance)
- (chaotic chatter, noise)

1483
01:58:48,622 --> 01:58:50,581
(cheering continues nearby)

1484
01:59:09,934 --> 01:59:14,104
- Milt, you gotta stop this thing!
- How can I stop it? On what evidence?

1485
01:59:14,272 --> 01:59:17,358
If there was a bomb planted here,
you'd stop it.

1486
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:18,942
You'd empty the White House
if you had to.

1487
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:22,196
I tell you, there's a time bomb here
just waiting to go off.

1488
01:59:26,034 --> 01:59:29,411
(male announcer) Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.

1489
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:34,416
(woman singing)
# Oh, say can you see

1490
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:38,754
# By the dawn's early light

1491
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:43,258
# What so proudly we hailed

1492
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:48,347
# At the twilight's last gleaming

1493
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:50,057
# Whose broad stripes...

1494
01:59:50,225 --> 01:59:53,185
(whispering) Stop twitching.
Raymond has never missed with a rifle.

1495
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:57,731
# Through the perilous flight

1496
01:59:57,899 --> 02:00:02,695
# O'er the ramparts we watched

1497
02:00:02,862 --> 02:00:07,825
# Were so gallantly streaming

1498
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:13,038
# And the rockets' red glare

1499
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:18,252
# The bombs bursting in air

1500
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:23,424
# Gave proof through the night

1501
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:29,513
# That our flag was still there

1502
02:00:29,681 --> 02:00:32,933
# O say, does that

1503
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:37,062
# Star-spangled banner

1504
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:41,692
# Yet wave

1505
02:00:43,194 --> 02:00:48,741
# O'er the land of the free...

1506
02:00:48,908 --> 02:00:50,743
We're in like Flynn, lover.

1507
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:54,246
# And the home

1508
02:00:54,414 --> 02:00:59,835
# Of the brave #

1509
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,130
- (wild cheering)
- (applause)

1510
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:14,516
- (man) Ladies and gentlemen...
- Just take it easy.

1511
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:19,271
I give you the next President
of the United States!

1512
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,192
- Benjamin K. Arthur!
- (cheering)

1513
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:26,779
(applause)

1514
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:53,055
- Mr. Chairman.
- (applause fading)

1515
02:01:53,223 --> 02:01:55,015
Delegates.

1516
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:58,101
My fellow Americans.

1517
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:04,024
It is with great humility,
albeit with enormous pride

1518
02:02:04,192 --> 02:02:07,903
and with a sense of the job to be done,

1519
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:11,949
that I most humbly and most gratefully

1520
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:16,829
accept this nomination
for the highest office in our land.

1521
02:02:16,996 --> 02:02:18,580
(applause)

1522
02:02:23,878 --> 02:02:27,965
It is with a full awareness
that the four years

1523
02:02:28,132 --> 02:02:31,426
that lie ahead for this country

1524
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:34,596
are, in a sense, the crucial years.

1525
02:02:34,764 --> 02:02:40,185
The years, if I may borrow
Mr. Churchill's phrase,

1526
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:42,896
the years of decision.

1527
02:02:43,064 --> 02:02:47,734
And, if I may be
permitted a phrase of my own,

1528
02:02:47,902 --> 02:02:50,904
the years of striving!

1529
02:02:51,072 --> 02:02:56,743
For it is not
what has been done in the past,

1530
02:02:56,911 --> 02:03:00,497
nor what may be done
against the far horizons

1531
02:03:00,665 --> 02:03:06,670
of some distant future,
but what will be done now!

1532
02:03:17,432 --> 02:03:20,100
(speech continues indistinctly)

1533
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:28,942
Nor would I ask of any fellow American

1534
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:33,947
in defense of his freedom... (coughing)

1535
02:03:39,704 --> 02:03:43,457
...that which I would not
gladly give myself.

1536
02:03:43,625 --> 02:03:47,044
My life before my liberty!

1537
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:48,921
(cheering)

1538
02:03:49,547 --> 02:03:51,715
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

1539
02:03:51,883 --> 02:03:54,801
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

1540
02:04:14,614 --> 02:04:18,575
You couldn't have stopped them. The
Army couldn't have either. So I had to.

1541
02:04:18,743 --> 02:04:20,452
That's why I didn't call.

1542
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:25,666
Oh, God, Ben!

1543
02:04:25,833 --> 02:04:28,919
- (gunshot)
- (thunder rumbling)

1544
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:38,470
Poor Raymond.

1545
02:04:38,638 --> 02:04:41,098
Poor friendless, friendless Raymond.

1546
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:46,770
He was wearing his medal when he died.

1547
02:04:50,942 --> 02:04:53,819
You should read
some of the citations sometime.

1548
02:04:54,904 --> 02:04:56,613
Just read them.

1549
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:02,911
"Taken eight prisoners,
killing four enemy in the process,

1550
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:05,122
while one leg
and one arm were shattered

1551
02:05:05,289 --> 02:05:09,835
and he could only crawl because the
other leg had been blown off. Edwards.

1552
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:13,338
Wounded five times.
Dragged himself across the direct fire

1553
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:16,925
of three enemy machine guns
to pull two of his wounded men

1554
02:05:17,093 --> 02:05:22,139
to safety amid 69 dead
and 203 casualties.

1555
02:05:22,306 --> 02:05:24,307
Holderman."

1556
02:05:35,445 --> 02:05:40,824
Made to commit acts
too unspeakable to be cited here...

1557
02:05:43,828 --> 02:05:48,331
...by an enemy who had
captured his mind and his soul.

1558
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:55,130
He freed himself at last...

1559
02:05:57,592 --> 02:06:03,346
...and in the end, heroically
and unhesitatingly, gave his life

1560
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:08,185
to save his country. Raymond Shaw.

1561
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:18,070
- Hell! Hell!
- (thunder crashing)
