1
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:32,557
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,203
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:39,036
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,454
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:42,747
Stand by.

6
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:46,128
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:48,545
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,657
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:19,865
Sir.

10
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,737
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected
pleasure. We're honoured.

11
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,153
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

12
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,774
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,946
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,496
Perhaps I can find
new ways to motivate them.

15
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,788
I tell you this station
will be operational as planned.

16
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:21,878
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,213
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:28,465
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:33,224
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:38,098
and he is most displeased with
your apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,691
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:44,104
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:48,105
The emperor is not
as forgiving as I am.

24
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,504
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:12,419
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,842
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:20,261
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,269
you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,823
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:44,079
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,833
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,335
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:20,982
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:24,736
We'd better go.

35
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:35,420
R2, wait.

36
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,297
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:42,711
R2, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

38
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,802
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,509
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,224
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,316
Oh, my!

42
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:05,395
Oh, no.

43
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,954
Oh, my.

44
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,794
We bring a message
to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:25,714
And a gift.

46
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:27,170
What gift?

47
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:48,899
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,489
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,336
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,989
Good morning.

51
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,500
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:04,221
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:06,637
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:10,635
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:14,107
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:17,897
<i>and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:21,812
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:28,239
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure
we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,078
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:32,875
<i>and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,168
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...</i>

62
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:40,039
<i>these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:42,046
What did he say?

64
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:45,709
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:49,593
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,978
He's no Jedi.

67
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:04,440
There will be no bargain.

68
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,776
We're doomed.

69
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:13,868
I will not give up
my favourite decoration.

70
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:18,787
I like Captain Solo where he is.

71
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,577
R2, look. Captain Solo.

72
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,249
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

73
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:40,847
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

74
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:45,845
Was it something I did? He never
expressed any unhappiness with my work.

75
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,525
How horrid!

76
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,757
Good. New acquisitions.

77
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,509
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

78
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,549
I am C-3PO...

79
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,427
Yes or no will do.

80
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,055
Well, yes.

81
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,678
How many languages do you speak?

82
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,432
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

83
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,189
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

84
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,654
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

85
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,574
and disintegrated him.

86
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,278
Disintegrated?

87
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:52,997
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

88
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:55,284
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

89
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,754
and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

90
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:01,337
R2, don't leave me!

91
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,631
You're a feisty little one...

92
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:11,221
but you'll soon learn some respect.

93
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:14,637
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

94
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:17,475
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

95
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:49,460
Ah! Do that again!

96
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:47,033
I have come for the bounty
on this Wookiee.

97
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:49,405
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

98
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:57,707
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

99
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:06,294
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

100
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:08,750
Yes?

101
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,977
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

102
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,679
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

103
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:25,774
I want 50,000. No less.

104
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,562
"50,000. No less."

105
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,203
What did I say?

106
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:52,212
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

107
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:58,506
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

108
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:14,355
This bounty hunter
is my kind of scum...

109
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:18,110
fearless and inventive.

110
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,377
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

111
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,661
and I do suggest you take it.

112
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:39,843
He agrees!

113
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,406
Just relax for a moment.

114
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:35,164
You're free of the carbonite.

115
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:40,707
You have hibernation sickness.

116
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:45,302
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

117
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,715
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

118
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,643
Who are you?

119
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,106
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

120
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:06,606
I gotta get you out of here.

121
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:11,070
What's that?

122
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,704
I know that laugh.

123
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:22,951
Hey, Jabba.

124
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,923
Look, Jabba, I was just
on my way to pay you back.

125
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,920
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:32,753
It's too late for that, Solo.

127
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,597
You may have been a good smuggler...

128
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:41,178
but now you're Bantha fodder.

129
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,808
Look...

130
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:50,151
Take him away.

131
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,023
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

132
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:54,648
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

133
00:20:57,578 --> 00:20:59,736
Bring her to me.

134
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,832
We have powerful friends.

135
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,202
You're gonna regret this.

136
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:11,963
I'm sure.

137
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:17,839
I can't bear to watch.

138
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:33,902
Chewie?

139
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,654
Chewie, is that you?

140
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:42,189
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

141
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:45,195
What's going on?

142
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,327
Luke? Luke's crazy.

143
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:52,993
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

144
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,754
AJedi knight?

145
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:01,416
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

146
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,763
I'm all right, pal.

147
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,184
I'm all right.

148
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,143
I must speak with Jabba.

149
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,317
No bargain.

150
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,907
You will take me to Jabba now.

151
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,166
You serve your master well.

152
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,037
And you will be rewarded.

153
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,179
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

154
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:39,718
Master.

155
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,895
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

156
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:49,268
I told you not to admit him.

157
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,192
I must be allowed to speak.

158
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,071
He must be allowed to speak.

159
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,860
You weak-minded fool!

160
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,239
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

161
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:07,824
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

162
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:18,958
Your mind powers
will not work on me, boy.

163
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,252
Nevertheless...

164
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:24,342
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

165
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:28,306
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

166
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:31,389
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

167
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:35,725
Master Luke, you're standing on...

168
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,438
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

169
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:45,191
I shall enjoy watching you die.

170
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:18,844
Oh, no! The rancor!

171
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:09,840
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

172
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,182
They will all suffer for this outrage.

173
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:30,067
Han.

174
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:36,819
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

175
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:39,360
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

176
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:42,166
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

177
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,782
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

178
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:49,880
Oh, dear.

179
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:53,841
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

180
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:57,005
has decreed that you are
to be terminated immediately.

181
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,762
Good. I hate long waits.

182
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:03,757
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

183
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:06,219
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

184
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:08,643
nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

185
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:09,971
Doesn't sound so bad.

186
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:13,975
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

187
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,196
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

188
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,822
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

189
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,576
You should have bargained, Jabba.

190
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,870
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

191
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,130
I think my eyes are getting better.

192
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:25,376
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

193
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,427
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

194
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:32,390
You're gonna die here,
you know. Convenient.

195
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:34,804
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

196
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,260
I've taken care of everything.

197
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:39,427
Great.

198
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:49,902
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

199
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,106
I'm terribly sorry.

200
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:56,160
R2, what are you doing here?

201
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,324
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

202
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,411
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

203
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,205
I wish I had your confidence.

204
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,733
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

205
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:35,982
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

206
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,440
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

207
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:44,575
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

208
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:54,132
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

209
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:56,878
he'll get no such pleasure from us!

210
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,800
Right?

211
00:32:02,097 --> 00:32:04,173
This is your last chance.

212
00:32:04,308 --> 00:32:06,384
Free us or die.

213
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:13,642
Move him into position.

214
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:40,080
Put him in.

215
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:05,987
Easy, Chewie.

216
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:17,414
Help!

217
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,378
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

218
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,930
Han, Chewie!

219
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,086
Lando.

220
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,518
Boba Fett?

221
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,977
Boba Fett? Where?

222
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:23,174
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

223
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:24,684
I'm trying!

224
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,238
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

225
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:04,210
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

226
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:14,932
Gently, now.

227
00:35:15,064 --> 00:35:17,103
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

228
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,410
Chewie, give me the gun.

229
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:33,537
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

230
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,656
I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

231
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,333
A little higher!

232
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,497
Chewie, pull us up.

233
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:45,173
Up, Chewie. Up.

234
00:35:47,009 --> 00:35:48,587
We gotta get out of here.

235
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:51,095
Not my eyes! R2, help!

236
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,136
Quickly, R2!

237
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:55,714
Beast!

238
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,933
Get the gun!

239
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,310
Point it at the deck.

240
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:11,406
Point it at the deck!

241
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:17,739
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

242
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,418
Come on.

243
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:34,923
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

244
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:16,207
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

245
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:18,961
<i>Hurry. The Alliance
should be assembled by now.</i>

246
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:21,762
<i>- I will.
- Luke, thanks.</i>

247
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:25,137
<i>Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.</i>

248
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:33,261
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

249
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:41,936
I have a promise to keep...

250
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:44,029
to an old friend.

251
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:36,662
Rise, my friend.

252
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:46,627
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

253
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:49,914
You've done well, Lord Vader.

254
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:55,885
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

255
00:38:58,349 --> 00:38:59,760
Yes, my master.

256
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,181
Patience, my friend.

257
00:39:03,313 --> 00:39:06,645
In time, he will seek you out.

258
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:11,186
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

259
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,608
He has grown strong.

260
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:19,408
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

261
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:21,279
As you wish.

262
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:26,910
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

263
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,185
That face you make...

264
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:58,815
Look I so old to young eyes?

265
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,689
No, of course not.

266
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:03,740
I do.

267
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,827
Yes, I do.

268
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:13,489
Sick have I become.

269
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,583
Old and weak.

270
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:22,166
When 900 years old you reach...

271
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,127
Iook as good you will not.

272
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:33,139
Soon will I rest.

273
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:36,388
Yes. Forever sleep.

274
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,648
Earned it I have.

275
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:42,444
Master Yoda, you can't die.

276
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:46,698
Strong am I with the Force...

277
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:48,780
but not that strong.

278
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:56,618
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

279
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,210
That is the way of things...

280
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:06,545
the way of the Force.

281
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,341
But I need your help.

282
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,635
I've come back
to complete the training.

283
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:15,886
No more training do you require.

284
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:19,136
Already know you
that which you need.

285
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,513
Then I am a Jedi.

286
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,107
Not yet.

287
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,232
One thing remains...

288
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:40,697
Vader. You must confront Vader.

289
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:45,625
Then... only then...
a Jedi will you be.

290
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:49,500
And confront him you will.

291
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:55,635
Master Yoda...

292
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:01,796
is Darth Vader my father?

293
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:07,426
Rest I need.

294
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:08,973
Yes.

295
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,730
Rest.

296
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,607
Yoda, I must know.

297
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:21,106
Your father he is.

298
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:29,951
Told you, did he?

299
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,085
Yes.

300
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:37,210
Unexpected this is.

301
00:42:39,216 --> 00:42:40,627
And unfortunate.

302
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,467
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

303
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:45,877
No.

304
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:53,014
Unfortunate that
you rushed to face him...

305
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,684
that incomplete
was your training...

306
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,273
that not ready
for the burden were you.

307
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,903
I'm sorry.

308
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:10,619
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

309
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,410
But beware.

310
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:21,078
Anger, fear, aggression...

311
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:23,834
the dark side are they.

312
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:28,291
Once you start down the dark path...

313
00:43:28,428 --> 00:43:32,176
forever will it dominate your destiny.

314
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:41,181
Do not...

315
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:48,771
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

316
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:53,315
or suffer your father's fate you will.

317
00:43:57,788 --> 00:43:59,827
When gone am I...

318
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:03,791
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:12,377
The Force runs strong in your family.

320
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:18,469
Pass on what you have learned.

321
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:30,106
There is...

322
00:44:31,276 --> 00:44:32,936
another...

323
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:41,444
Skywalker.

324
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,131
I can't do it, R2.

325
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:50,420
I can't go on alone.

326
00:45:50,557 --> 00:45:52,714
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

327
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:55,007
Obi-Wan.

328
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:04,692
Why didn't you tell me?

329
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:08,687
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

330
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:14,327
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

331
00:46:14,453 --> 00:46:18,367
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

332
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:19,993
When that happened...

333
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:23,291
the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

334
00:46:24,337 --> 00:46:26,744
So what I told you was true...

335
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:28,708
from a certain point of view.

336
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:31,297
A certain point of view?

337
00:46:31,427 --> 00:46:35,294
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

338
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,348
depend greatly
on our own point of view.

339
00:46:39,142 --> 00:46:41,847
Anakin was a good friend.

340
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:44,389
When I first knew him...

341
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:46,680
your father was already a great pilot...

342
00:46:46,816 --> 00:46:50,434
but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

343
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:54,519
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

344
00:46:54,657 --> 00:46:58,570
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

345
00:46:58,701 --> 00:46:59,982
I was wrong.

346
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:02,827
There is still good in him.

347
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:05,706
He's more machine now than man...

348
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,790
twisted and evil.

349
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:11,751
I can't do it, Ben.

350
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,790
You cannot escape your destiny.

351
00:47:13,924 --> 00:47:17,173
You must face Darth Vader again.

352
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,089
I can't kill my own father.

353
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:26,433
Then the emperor has already won.

354
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,719
You were our only hope.

355
00:47:31,022 --> 00:47:33,145
Yoda spoke of another.

356
00:47:35,193 --> 00:47:37,766
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

357
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:40,653
But I have no sister.

358
00:47:41,782 --> 00:47:43,691
To protect you both
from the emperor...

359
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:47,409
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

360
00:47:47,538 --> 00:47:49,993
The emperor knew, as I did...

361
00:47:50,123 --> 00:47:53,823
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

362
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,498
they would be a threat to him.

363
00:47:56,629 --> 00:48:01,919
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

364
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:08,419
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

365
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:12,594
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

366
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:15,099
They do you credit...

367
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:18,314
but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

368
00:48:40,795 --> 00:48:43,463
Look at you. A general, huh?

369
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,672
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

370
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,670
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

371
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:52,756
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

372
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,011
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

373
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,848
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

374
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,768
You're the respectable one, remember?

375
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,065
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

376
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:15,731
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

377
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:17,990
of the emperor's new battle station.

378
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,911
We also know
that the weapon systems...

379
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:22,280
of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

380
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:25,369
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

381
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:26,995
in a vain effort to engage us...

382
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:29,001
it is relatively unprotected.

383
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,169
But most important of all...

384
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:34,000
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

385
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:36,257
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

386
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:38,841
of the construction
of this Death Star.

387
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:44,183
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

388
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:48,057
Admiral Ackbar, please.

389
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:53,313
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

390
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:58,899
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

391
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:02,531
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

392
00:50:03,828 --> 00:50:06,117
It is protected by an energy shield...

393
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:09,864
which is generated
from the nearby forest moon of Endor.

394
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:19,253
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

395
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:24,590
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

396
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,639
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure...

397
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:30,720
and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

398
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:36,606
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

399
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,013
Good luck.

400
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:41,609
You're gonna need it.

401
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:43,445
General Madine.

402
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,407
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

403
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:51,745
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

404
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:56,663
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

405
00:50:56,793 --> 00:50:58,038
Sounds dangerous.

406
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:00,457
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

407
00:51:00,587 --> 00:51:03,588
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

408
00:51:04,383 --> 00:51:07,633
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

409
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:10,880
It's gonna be rough.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

410
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:17,299
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

411
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:19,345
I'm with you too.

412
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:27,986
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

413
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,735
Hi, Han, Chewie.

414
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,322
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

415
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:53,960
Look, I want you to take her.

416
00:51:54,094 --> 00:51:55,636
I mean it. Take her.

417
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:59,178
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

418
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:01,633
All right, old buddy.

419
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,761
I know what she means to you.

420
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:07,595
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

421
00:52:08,899 --> 00:52:10,310
All right?

422
00:52:10,443 --> 00:52:11,723
Right.

423
00:52:18,616 --> 00:52:21,190
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

424
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:23,486
Would you get going, you pirate?

425
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:26,410
Good luck.

426
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,034
You too.

427
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:39,132
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

428
00:52:41,804 --> 00:52:45,422
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

429
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:57,690
Hey, you awake?

430
00:52:57,818 --> 00:53:01,270
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

431
00:53:03,407 --> 00:53:05,779
Come on, General. Let's move.

432
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,242
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

433
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:11,577
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

434
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,917
Here we go again.

435
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:28,838
All right, hang on.

436
00:53:45,153 --> 00:53:47,644
What is thy bidding, my master?

437
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:52,067
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

438
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:59,657
There it will stay until called for.

439
00:54:01,043 --> 00:54:05,087
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

440
00:54:05,213 --> 00:54:07,206
It is of no concern.

441
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:12,253
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

442
00:54:12,386 --> 00:54:14,177
Your work here is finished, my friend.

443
00:54:14,304 --> 00:54:16,974
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

444
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:19,008
Yes, my master.

445
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,776
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

446
00:54:40,037 --> 00:54:42,706
<i>We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.</i>

447
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:48,074
<i>Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.</i>

448
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:57,801
<i>Shuttle Tydirium, transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.</i>

449
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,631
Transmission commencing.

450
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,765
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

451
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:07,050
It'll work. It'll work.

452
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:10,595
Vader's on that ship.

453
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:12,558
Don't get jittery, Luke.

454
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:14,898
There are a lot of command ships.

455
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:19,568
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

456
00:55:20,823 --> 00:55:23,279
I don't know. Fly casual.

457
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,412
Where is that shuttle going?

458
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,580
<i>Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?</i>

459
00:55:35,587 --> 00:55:37,626
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

460
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,462
Do they have a code clearance?

461
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,502
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

462
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,595
I was about to clear them.

463
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:54,677
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

464
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,101
It's your imagination, kid.

465
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,982
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

466
00:56:08,117 --> 00:56:09,575
Shall I hold them?

467
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,530
No. Leave them to me.

468
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,952
I will deal with them myself.

469
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,039
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

470
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,793
They're not going for it, Chewie.

471
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,716
<i>Shuttle Tydirium...</i>

472
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:31,215
<i>deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

473
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:33,634
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

474
00:56:33,764 --> 00:56:36,255
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

475
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,555
No problem.

476
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:13,005
I told you it was dangerous here.

477
00:57:28,439 --> 00:57:31,890
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

478
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:35,026
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

479
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:40,153
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

480
00:57:40,283 --> 00:57:42,952
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

481
00:57:43,078 --> 00:57:44,453
Hey...

482
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:45,859
it's me.

483
00:58:11,478 --> 00:58:13,471
Go for help! Go!

484
00:58:13,605 --> 00:58:15,099
Great. Come on!

485
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,619
Over there! Two more of them.

486
00:58:33,665 --> 00:58:35,954
I see them. Wait. Leia!

487
00:58:39,837 --> 00:58:41,295
Hey, wait!

488
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:50,049
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

489
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,267
Move closer.

490
00:59:05,736 --> 00:59:07,194
Get alongside that one.

491
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:50,731
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

492
01:02:04,648 --> 01:02:06,391
General Solo, somebody's coming.

493
01:02:19,745 --> 01:02:20,860
Where's Leia?

494
01:02:21,747 --> 01:02:24,154
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

495
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,781
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

496
01:02:26,918 --> 01:02:29,954
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

497
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:32,127
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

498
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:36,003
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

499
01:02:37,511 --> 01:02:39,634
And you said it was pretty here.

500
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:04,282
Cut it out.

501
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:23,210
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
01:03:31,268 --> 01:03:33,937
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

503
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:38,227
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

504
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:41,232
Maybe you can help me.

505
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,194
Come on. Sit down.

506
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,280
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

507
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,526
All right.
You want something to eat?

508
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,752
That's right.

509
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:07,382
Come on.

510
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:28,986
Look. It's a hat.

511
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:31,068
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

512
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:40,160
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

513
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,002
What is it?

514
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:27,903
Freeze!

515
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,247
Come on. Get up.

516
01:05:34,672 --> 01:05:37,458
- Get your ride. Take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

517
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:43,424
What the...

518
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:03,060
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

519
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:47,939
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

520
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:54,401
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

521
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:57,703
Yes, I know.

522
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,454
My son is with them.

523
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:07,753
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

524
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:11,706
Strange that I have not.

525
01:07:13,302 --> 01:07:18,509
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

526
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:21,393
They are clear, my master.

527
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:25,765
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

528
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:28,898
He will come to me?

529
01:07:31,152 --> 01:07:33,477
I have foreseen it.

530
01:07:33,612 --> 01:07:37,657
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

531
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:41,697
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

532
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:44,037
As you wish.

533
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,010
Master Luke.

534
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:13,481
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

535
01:08:13,608 --> 01:08:15,516
And I found this.

536
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:21,404
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

537
01:08:23,825 --> 01:08:25,450
I hope she's all right.

538
01:08:30,414 --> 01:08:31,529
What, Chewie?

539
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,036
What, Chewie?

540
01:08:49,514 --> 01:08:52,883
I don't get it.
It's just a dead animal.

541
01:08:53,727 --> 01:08:55,601
Chewie, wait! Don't!

542
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:01,608
Nice work.

543
01:09:03,402 --> 01:09:05,229
Great, Chewie.

544
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:07,439
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

545
01:09:07,573 --> 01:09:10,739
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

546
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:12,575
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

547
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:14,161
Yeah. Sure.

548
01:09:21,678 --> 01:09:24,216
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

549
01:09:24,347 --> 01:09:26,340
It's a very long drop!

550
01:10:09,263 --> 01:10:12,181
Hey. Point that thing
someplace else.

551
01:10:16,728 --> 01:10:17,842
Hey!

552
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:20,435
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

553
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:29,151
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

554
01:10:31,241 --> 01:10:32,866
Oh, my head.

555
01:10:37,121 --> 01:10:38,913
Oh, my goodness.

556
01:11:10,735 --> 01:11:12,644
Do you understand
anything they're saying?

557
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:14,190
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

558
01:11:14,322 --> 01:11:17,108
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

559
01:11:17,241 --> 01:11:18,865
What are you telling them?

560
01:11:20,077 --> 01:11:22,153
"Hello," I think.

561
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:25,324
I could be mistaken...
they're using a very primitive dialect...

562
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:28,991
but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

563
01:11:33,297 --> 01:11:37,793
Why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

564
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,797
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

565
01:11:41,805 --> 01:11:43,180
Proper?

566
01:11:43,306 --> 01:11:45,928
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

567
01:11:46,059 --> 01:11:47,304
Why, you...

568
01:11:55,526 --> 01:11:57,020
My mistake.

569
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:00,694
He's an old friend of mine.

570
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:29,222
Hey.

571
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,861
I have a really bad feeling about this.

572
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,463
What did he say?

573
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,919
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

574
01:13:14,055 --> 01:13:17,554
but it appears you are to be the main
course at a banquet in my honour.

575
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:37,446
Your Royal Highness.

576
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:39,320
These are my friends.

577
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:46,625
3PO, tell them
they must be set free.

578
01:14:04,435 --> 01:14:07,600
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

579
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:11,643
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish...

580
01:14:11,774 --> 01:14:13,731
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

581
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,232
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

582
01:14:16,362 --> 01:14:17,903
Tell them.

583
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,912
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

584
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:37,624
just as I said they wouldn't.

585
01:14:37,757 --> 01:14:39,036
Wait.

586
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:49,556
What's happening?

587
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,688
Put me down!
Help!

588
01:14:56,815 --> 01:14:58,357
Somebody!

589
01:14:58,484 --> 01:14:59,812
Somebody help!

590
01:14:59,943 --> 01:15:02,647
Master Luke! R2, quickly!

591
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,766
Thank goodness.

592
01:15:48,112 --> 01:15:49,772
Thanks, 3PO.

593
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:52,988
I never knew I had it in me.

594
01:16:00,581 --> 01:16:02,040
...Tatooine...

595
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:05,866
Princess Leia... R2.

596
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:09,505
...Darth Vader!

597
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,378
...Death Star.

598
01:16:17,388 --> 01:16:19,630
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.

599
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:27,102
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

600
01:16:30,567 --> 01:16:31,563
Master Luke...

601
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,858
<i>...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.</i>

602
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:45,617
...Vader!

603
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:47,909
Han Solo...

604
01:16:50,084 --> 01:16:51,543
...carbon.

605
01:16:53,129 --> 01:16:54,374
...Sarlacc.

606
01:17:16,025 --> 01:17:18,860
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

607
01:17:32,623 --> 01:17:35,292
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

608
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,584
Just what I always wanted.

609
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,677
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

610
01:17:58,313 --> 01:18:01,516
The scouts will show us the quickest
way to the shield generator.

611
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,606
Good. How far is it?

612
01:18:03,734 --> 01:18:05,359
Ask him.

613
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:08,693
We need some fresh supplies too.

614
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:10,732
Try and get our weapons back.

615
01:18:12,243 --> 01:18:14,448
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

616
01:18:16,955 --> 01:18:18,829
Luke, what's wrong?

617
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,201
Leia, do you remember
your mother...

618
01:18:24,336 --> 01:18:26,376
your real mother?

619
01:18:26,505 --> 01:18:30,004
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

620
01:18:30,134 --> 01:18:32,043
What do you remember?

621
01:18:32,177 --> 01:18:34,750
Just images really. Feelings.

622
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:36,465
Tell me.

623
01:18:38,182 --> 01:18:41,219
She was... very beautiful.

624
01:18:41,352 --> 01:18:43,974
Kind... but sad.

625
01:18:46,148 --> 01:18:48,935
Why are you asking me this?

626
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:51,523
I have no memory of my mother.

627
01:18:52,571 --> 01:18:54,563
I never knew her.

628
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,524
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

629
01:19:03,456 --> 01:19:07,239
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

630
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,585
How do you know?

631
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,621
I felt his presence.

632
01:19:13,673 --> 01:19:16,922
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

633
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:18,924
That's why I have to go.

634
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:22,504
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

635
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:26,511
- I have to face him.
- Why?

636
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:33,396
He's my father.

637
01:19:37,445 --> 01:19:38,986
Your father?

638
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,278
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

639
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:47,244
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

640
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:48,864
Don't talk that way.

641
01:19:48,996 --> 01:19:53,492
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

642
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:55,618
You're wrong, Leia.

643
01:19:55,753 --> 01:19:57,580
You have that power too.

644
01:19:57,713 --> 01:20:01,046
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

645
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:07,920
The Force is strong in my family.

646
01:20:09,474 --> 01:20:11,382
My father has it.

647
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,683
I have it.

648
01:20:14,812 --> 01:20:16,140
And...

649
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:19,811
my sister has it.

650
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:29,233
Yes. It's you, Leia.

651
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,121
I know.

652
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,583
Somehow...

653
01:20:42,294 --> 01:20:43,872
I've always known.

654
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,962
Then you know
why I have to face him.

655
01:20:48,092 --> 01:20:50,500
Luke, run away.
Far away.

656
01:20:50,636 --> 01:20:53,969
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

657
01:20:54,097 --> 01:20:57,347
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

658
01:20:57,475 --> 01:20:59,432
You've always been strong.

659
01:21:00,729 --> 01:21:03,017
But why must you confront him?

660
01:21:03,147 --> 01:21:06,847
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

661
01:21:06,984 --> 01:21:08,976
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

662
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:12,231
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

663
01:21:13,657 --> 01:21:15,448
I have to try.

664
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:35,875
Hey, what's going on?

665
01:21:37,678 --> 01:21:40,964
Nothing. I just wanna
be alone for a little while.

666
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:43,974
Nothing?

667
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:47,678
Tell me.
What's going on?

668
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:55,017
I can't tell you.

669
01:21:56,653 --> 01:21:59,275
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

670
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:18,755
I'm sorry.

671
01:22:22,469 --> 01:22:24,177
Hold me.

672
01:23:17,477 --> 01:23:19,351
This is the rebel that surrendered.

673
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:22,396
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

674
01:23:22,523 --> 01:23:25,228
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

675
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,023
He was armed only with this.

676
01:23:31,032 --> 01:23:32,739
Good work, Commander.

677
01:23:32,866 --> 01:23:34,775
Leave us.

678
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:38,575
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

679
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,783
Yes, my lord.

680
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,748
The emperor has been expecting you.

681
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:48,540
I know, Father.

682
01:23:50,049 --> 01:23:52,374
So, you have accepted the truth.

683
01:23:53,552 --> 01:23:57,050
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

684
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:00,383
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

685
01:24:01,184 --> 01:24:03,935
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

686
01:24:04,728 --> 01:24:06,352
I know there is good in you.

687
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,101
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

688
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,275
That was why
you couldn't destroy me.

689
01:24:16,322 --> 01:24:18,860
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

690
01:24:26,122 --> 01:24:29,159
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

691
01:24:32,796 --> 01:24:35,750
Your skills are complete.

692
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:45,548
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

693
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,263
Come with me.

694
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:57,227
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

695
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:03,319
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

696
01:25:03,448 --> 01:25:06,200
I must obey my master.

697
01:25:07,285 --> 01:25:10,700
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

698
01:25:12,081 --> 01:25:14,654
If that is your destiny.

699
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:18,576
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

700
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:21,333
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

701
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:26,006
It is too late for me, son.

702
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:33,550
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

703
01:25:33,684 --> 01:25:37,302
He is your master now.

704
01:25:41,357 --> 01:25:43,765
Then my father is truly dead.

705
01:26:26,774 --> 01:26:28,683
The main entrance
to the control bunker...

706
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:30,810
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

707
01:26:31,695 --> 01:26:35,312
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Don't worry.

708
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:38,568
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

709
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:48,541
What's he saying?

710
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:52,002
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

711
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:14,600
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

712
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:17,441
Proceed with the countdown.

713
01:27:18,654 --> 01:27:21,109
All groups assume attack coordinates.

714
01:27:24,493 --> 01:27:26,450
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

715
01:27:26,578 --> 01:27:29,115
He'll have that shield down on time.

716
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,574
Or this'll be
the shortest offensive of all time.

717
01:27:36,546 --> 01:27:40,245
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

718
01:27:40,382 --> 01:27:42,339
All right. Stand by.

719
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,066
Back door, huh? Good idea.

720
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:15,407
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

721
01:28:20,585 --> 01:28:23,420
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

722
01:28:23,546 --> 01:28:26,037
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

723
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:28,665
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

724
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:31,801
I'm afraid our furry companion...

725
01:28:31,928 --> 01:28:34,051
has gone and done something
rather rash.

726
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,518
There goes our surprise attack.

727
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:51,061
Look, over there! Stop him!

728
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:05,993
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

729
01:29:06,126 --> 01:29:08,582
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

730
01:29:10,714 --> 01:29:12,921
I have decided that we shall stay here.

731
01:29:42,785 --> 01:29:43,781
Hey!

732
01:30:47,927 --> 01:30:50,714
Welcome, young Skywalker.

733
01:30:50,846 --> 01:30:53,171
I have been expecting you.

734
01:30:54,224 --> 01:30:56,182
You'll no longer need those.

735
01:31:01,648 --> 01:31:03,521
Guards, leave us.

736
01:31:10,949 --> 01:31:14,399
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

737
01:31:14,534 --> 01:31:19,611
In time, you will call me master.

738
01:31:19,748 --> 01:31:22,203
You're gravely mistaken.

739
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:24,456
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

740
01:31:25,336 --> 01:31:29,084
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

741
01:31:31,217 --> 01:31:35,296
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

742
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:40,849
about a great many things.

743
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,184
His lightsabre.

744
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:47,976
Ah, yes. AJedi's weapon.

745
01:31:48,774 --> 01:31:51,182
Much like your father's.

746
01:31:51,318 --> 01:31:56,110
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

747
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:59,074
So will it be with you.

748
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,240
You're wrong.

749
01:32:01,369 --> 01:32:04,453
Soon I'll be dead...
and you with me.

750
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:12,210
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

751
01:32:13,046 --> 01:32:14,457
Yes.

752
01:32:14,589 --> 01:32:19,713
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

753
01:32:20,886 --> 01:32:23,757
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

754
01:32:23,889 --> 01:32:27,008
Your faith in your friends is yours.

755
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:33,144
It is pointless to resist, my son.

756
01:32:37,192 --> 01:32:42,649
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

757
01:32:42,781 --> 01:32:45,985
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

758
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:50,446
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

759
01:32:52,373 --> 01:32:54,864
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

760
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:58,416
to know the location
of the shield generator.

761
01:32:58,545 --> 01:33:02,590
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

762
01:33:02,716 --> 01:33:06,963
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

763
01:33:09,472 --> 01:33:13,220
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

764
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:18,558
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

765
01:33:22,108 --> 01:33:23,437
All right!

766
01:33:23,568 --> 01:33:25,062
Up! Move!

767
01:33:25,195 --> 01:33:26,654
Quickly. Quickly.

768
01:33:31,158 --> 01:33:32,783
Han, hurry.

769
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:34,784
The fleet will be here any moment.

770
01:33:36,497 --> 01:33:38,739
Charges. Come on. Come on!

771
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,702
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

772
01:33:45,588 --> 01:33:47,296
Wait! Come back!

773
01:33:49,801 --> 01:33:51,591
R2, stay with me.

774
01:33:52,636 --> 01:33:54,260
Freeze!

775
01:33:57,641 --> 01:33:59,598
You rebel scum.

776
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,655
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

777
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:25,955
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

778
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:28,957
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

779
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:34,753
May the Force be with us.

780
01:34:38,344 --> 01:34:41,345
We've gotta be able to get
a reading on that shield... up or down.

781
01:34:43,016 --> 01:34:45,684
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

782
01:34:46,727 --> 01:34:48,304
if we're coming.

783
01:34:48,437 --> 01:34:51,936
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

784
01:34:52,065 --> 01:34:54,141
I get no reading. You sure?

785
01:34:54,276 --> 01:34:56,433
<i>Pull up! All craft pull up!</i>

786
01:35:00,948 --> 01:35:04,898
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

787
01:35:06,745 --> 01:35:09,496
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

788
01:35:09,623 --> 01:35:11,117
It's a trap.

789
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:16,667
Fighters coming in.

790
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:21,460
There's too many.

791
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:28,171
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

792
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:29,337
Copy, Gold Leader.

793
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,263
Come, boy.

794
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:37,103
See for yourself.

795
01:35:39,775 --> 01:35:44,982
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

796
01:35:45,113 --> 01:35:48,944
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

797
01:35:54,205 --> 01:35:56,530
You want this...

798
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:59,206
don't you?

799
01:35:59,334 --> 01:36:03,830
The hate is swelling in you now.

800
01:36:04,631 --> 01:36:06,789
Take your Jedi weapon.

801
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:08,668
Use it.

802
01:36:08,802 --> 01:36:10,758
I am unarmed.

803
01:36:10,886 --> 01:36:12,760
Strike me down with it.

804
01:36:12,888 --> 01:36:15,426
Give in to your anger.

805
01:36:16,475 --> 01:36:21,599
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

806
01:36:28,194 --> 01:36:30,234
It is unavoidable.

807
01:36:31,321 --> 01:36:33,444
It is your destiny.

808
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:37,611
You, like your father...

809
01:36:37,744 --> 01:36:39,369
are now...

810
01:36:40,289 --> 01:36:41,912
mine.

811
01:37:00,056 --> 01:37:02,382
All right, move it.

812
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:12,024
Hello. I say, over there.

813
01:37:12,985 --> 01:37:15,142
Were you looking for me?

814
01:37:16,487 --> 01:37:18,527
Bring those two down here.

815
01:37:26,163 --> 01:37:30,457
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

816
01:37:30,584 --> 01:37:31,912
Freeze.

817
01:37:32,044 --> 01:37:33,158
Don't move.

818
01:37:33,295 --> 01:37:35,203
We surrender.

819
01:39:40,869 --> 01:39:42,743
The code's changed.

820
01:39:42,871 --> 01:39:45,242
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

821
01:39:45,372 --> 01:39:47,365
R2, where are you?

822
01:39:47,499 --> 01:39:49,457
We need you at the bunker
right away.

823
01:39:51,545 --> 01:39:53,039
Going? What do you mean?

824
01:39:54,756 --> 01:39:56,380
Going where, R2?

825
01:39:56,507 --> 01:40:00,719
Wait. R2, this is
no time for heroics.

826
01:40:00,845 --> 01:40:02,505
Come back!

827
01:40:28,745 --> 01:40:30,536
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

828
01:40:30,664 --> 01:40:33,581
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

829
01:40:36,835 --> 01:40:38,579
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

830
01:40:38,712 --> 01:40:40,420
Cut left.
I'll take the leader.

831
01:40:48,763 --> 01:40:50,506
They're heading
for the medical frigate.

832
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,718
Pressure's steady.

833
01:41:05,904 --> 01:41:09,189
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

834
01:41:13,828 --> 01:41:15,536
We're in attack position, sir.

835
01:41:15,663 --> 01:41:18,830
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

836
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:22,242
My orders are from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

837
01:41:22,377 --> 01:41:24,286
We only need to
keep them from escaping.

838
01:41:26,006 --> 01:41:30,085
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

839
01:41:30,217 --> 01:41:33,467
your friends have failed.

840
01:41:34,263 --> 01:41:36,635
Now witness the firepower...

841
01:41:36,765 --> 01:41:42,103
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

842
01:41:43,271 --> 01:41:45,809
Fire at will, Commander.

843
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:54,529
Fire.

844
01:42:01,163 --> 01:42:03,700
That blast came from the Death Star.

845
01:42:04,665 --> 01:42:06,991
That thing's operational.

846
01:42:07,126 --> 01:42:08,953
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

847
01:42:09,086 --> 01:42:11,162
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

848
01:42:11,297 --> 01:42:13,502
You won't get
another chance at this, Admiral.

849
01:42:13,632 --> 01:42:16,383
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

850
01:42:16,509 --> 01:42:19,795
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

851
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,629
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

852
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:43,861
We're coming.

853
01:42:49,748 --> 01:42:51,076
Come on.

854
01:42:54,878 --> 01:42:56,253
R2, hurry!

855
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,250
My goodness!

856
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,342
Why did you have to be so brave?

857
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:17,058
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

858
01:43:17,189 --> 01:43:18,648
I'll cover you.

859
01:44:00,228 --> 01:44:02,684
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

860
01:44:02,814 --> 01:44:05,519
and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

861
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:09,066
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

862
01:44:09,195 --> 01:44:11,816
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

863
01:44:11,947 --> 01:44:14,189
and we might
take a few of them with us.

864
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:18,448
She's gonna blow!

865
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,118
I'm hit!

866
01:44:29,297 --> 01:44:31,454
Your fleet is lost...

867
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:35,635
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

868
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:40,337
There is no escape...

869
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:43,094
my young apprentice.

870
01:44:45,311 --> 01:44:47,767
The Alliance will die...

871
01:44:49,649 --> 01:44:52,484
as will your friends.

872
01:44:56,112 --> 01:44:57,393
Good.

873
01:44:58,406 --> 01:45:01,657
I can feel your anger.

874
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:06,910
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

875
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:10,159
Strike me down
with all of your hatred...

876
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:14,787
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

877
01:45:54,082 --> 01:45:56,122
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

878
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:51,262
I think I got it.

879
01:47:51,397 --> 01:47:52,642
I got it!

880
01:47:59,946 --> 01:48:01,226
Are you all right?

881
01:48:01,364 --> 01:48:03,238
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

882
01:48:03,366 --> 01:48:04,645
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

883
01:48:04,783 --> 01:48:06,277
Don't move.

884
01:48:10,747 --> 01:48:13,452
- I love you.
- I know.

885
01:48:13,584 --> 01:48:14,912
Hands up.

886
01:48:16,043 --> 01:48:17,241
Stand up.

887
01:48:27,095 --> 01:48:28,554
Stay back.

888
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:39,183
Get down here.
She's wounded.

889
01:48:39,315 --> 01:48:41,141
No, wait.

890
01:48:41,275 --> 01:48:42,853
I got an idea.

891
01:48:54,162 --> 01:48:55,656
Good.

892
01:48:55,788 --> 01:48:59,571
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

893
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:02,413
Let the hate flow through you.

894
01:49:08,091 --> 01:49:11,673
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

895
01:49:15,139 --> 01:49:17,511
I will not fight you, Father.

896
01:49:31,612 --> 01:49:34,399
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

897
01:49:59,346 --> 01:50:01,754
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

898
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:05,009
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

899
01:50:05,142 --> 01:50:07,598
There is no conflict.

900
01:50:09,981 --> 01:50:11,938
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

901
01:50:12,066 --> 01:50:14,022
and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

902
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:18,694
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

903
01:50:18,822 --> 01:50:20,649
If you will not fight...

904
01:50:20,782 --> 01:50:23,355
then you will meet your destiny.

905
01:50:34,836 --> 01:50:36,034
Good.

906
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,581
Good.

907
01:50:46,263 --> 01:50:49,881
- Watch out. Squad at.06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

908
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:53,221
Good shot, Red Two.

909
01:50:56,856 --> 01:50:59,940
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

910
01:51:00,067 --> 01:51:01,727
Don't let me down.

911
01:51:06,281 --> 01:51:07,740
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

912
01:51:07,866 --> 01:51:10,191
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing.</i>

913
01:51:10,327 --> 01:51:12,865
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

914
01:51:13,955 --> 01:51:15,912
Send three squads to help.

915
01:51:16,041 --> 01:51:17,997
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

916
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:33,591
Throw me another charge.

917
01:51:51,155 --> 01:51:53,942
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

918
01:51:55,201 --> 01:51:57,110
I will not fight you.

919
01:52:00,622 --> 01:52:03,658
Give yourself to the dark side.

920
01:52:05,252 --> 01:52:09,296
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

921
01:52:10,339 --> 01:52:12,047
Yes.

922
01:52:12,174 --> 01:52:14,131
Your thoughts betray you.

923
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,798
Your feelings for them are strong...

924
01:52:16,929 --> 01:52:18,803
especially for...

925
01:52:20,974 --> 01:52:22,634
sister.

926
01:52:23,893 --> 01:52:28,223
So you have a twin sister.

927
01:52:28,356 --> 01:52:32,056
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

928
01:52:32,192 --> 01:52:36,272
Obi-Wan was wise
to hide her from me.

929
01:52:36,405 --> 01:52:40,782
Now his failure is complete.

930
01:52:42,285 --> 01:52:46,069
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

931
01:52:46,205 --> 01:52:48,992
then perhaps she will.

932
01:52:49,125 --> 01:52:50,038
Never!

933
01:53:35,666 --> 01:53:37,374
Good!

934
01:53:41,714 --> 01:53:44,419
Your hate has made you powerful.

935
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:50,593
Now, fulfil your destiny...

936
01:53:50,722 --> 01:53:54,802
and take your father's place at my side.

937
01:54:09,864 --> 01:54:11,193
Never.

938
01:54:14,244 --> 01:54:16,402
I'll never turn to the dark side.

939
01:54:19,373 --> 01:54:22,208
You've failed, Your Highness.

940
01:54:22,334 --> 01:54:24,291
I am a Jedi...

941
01:54:24,419 --> 01:54:26,459
like my father before me.

942
01:54:34,053 --> 01:54:37,504
So be it, Jedi.

943
01:54:37,723 --> 01:54:39,596
Move! Move!

944
01:54:52,236 --> 01:54:56,103
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

945
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:59,988
We're on our way. Red Group,
Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

946
01:55:00,119 --> 01:55:02,027
I told you they'd do it.

947
01:55:09,169 --> 01:55:11,789
If you will not be turned...

948
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,254
you will be destroyed.

949
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:24,007
Young fool.

950
01:55:25,099 --> 01:55:27,804
Only now, at the end...

951
01:55:27,935 --> 01:55:29,809
do you understand.

952
01:55:43,033 --> 01:55:48,785
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

953
01:55:52,625 --> 01:55:56,456
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

954
01:56:02,050 --> 01:56:03,877
Father, please!

955
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:21,348
Now, young Skywalker...

956
01:56:23,486 --> 01:56:25,313
you will die.

957
01:57:48,062 --> 01:57:49,521
I'm going in.

958
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:53,889
Here goes nothing.

959
01:58:00,991 --> 01:58:04,857
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

960
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:10,531
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

961
01:58:26,222 --> 01:58:28,214
Split up and head back to the surface.

962
01:58:28,349 --> 01:58:31,515
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

963
01:58:31,644 --> 01:58:32,593
Copy, Gold Leader.

964
01:58:42,904 --> 01:58:44,482
That was too close.

965
01:58:48,492 --> 01:58:50,650
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

966
01:58:50,786 --> 01:58:53,822
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Stardestroyer.

967
01:58:59,961 --> 01:59:02,084
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

968
01:59:02,213 --> 01:59:05,214
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

969
01:59:07,717 --> 01:59:09,461
Intensify forward firepower!

970
01:59:11,304 --> 01:59:12,502
Too late!

971
01:59:57,597 --> 02:00:01,463
Help me take this mask off.

972
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:03,473
But you'll die.

973
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:07,852
Nothing can stop that now.

974
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:10,564
Just for once...

975
02:00:11,525 --> 02:00:13,150
let me...

976
02:00:13,277 --> 02:00:16,728
Iook on you with my own eyes.

977
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:57,357
Now go, my son.

978
02:00:59,069 --> 02:01:00,480
Leave me.

979
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:04,026
No. You're coming with me.

980
02:01:04,156 --> 02:01:06,481
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

981
02:01:07,368 --> 02:01:11,068
You already have, Luke.

982
02:01:12,248 --> 02:01:14,120
You were right.

983
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:17,241
You were right about me.

984
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:20,962
Tell your sister...

985
02:01:22,006 --> 02:01:24,213
you were right.

986
02:01:31,306 --> 02:01:32,386
Father.

987
02:01:36,727 --> 02:01:38,056
I won't leave you.

988
02:02:03,502 --> 02:02:04,498
There it is.

989
02:02:07,464 --> 02:02:09,836
Wedge, go for the power regulator
on the north tower.

990
02:02:09,966 --> 02:02:13,252
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

991
02:02:32,487 --> 02:02:35,606
Move the fleet
away from the Death Star.

992
02:03:22,824 --> 02:03:24,484
They did it!

993
02:03:32,958 --> 02:03:35,365
I'm sure Luke wasn't
on that thing when it blew.

994
02:03:37,129 --> 02:03:38,955
He wasn't.

995
02:03:39,089 --> 02:03:40,749
I can feel it.

996
02:03:45,428 --> 02:03:47,005
You love him.

997
02:03:50,433 --> 02:03:51,843
Don't you?

998
02:03:51,976 --> 02:03:53,434
Yes.

999
02:03:53,561 --> 02:03:56,264
All right. I understand.

1000
02:03:56,396 --> 02:03:57,771
Fine.

1001
02:03:58,815 --> 02:04:00,606
When he comes back...

1002
02:04:01,693 --> 02:04:03,436
I won't get in the way.

1003
02:04:06,155 --> 02:04:08,112
It's not like that at all.

1004
02:04:11,827 --> 02:04:14,152
He's my brother.

1005
02:05:54,654 --> 02:05:56,279
Wesa free!
