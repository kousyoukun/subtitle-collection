1
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,780
We should have talked to the boatyard.

2
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
You don't wanna talk here.

3
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,480
l'm not falling over
to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.

4
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,380
- How much do you know?
- Not much.

5
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,080
The Birmingham one
was in the papers over a month ago,

6
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,880
and Atlanta was all over TV.

7
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,380
- Did you think about giving me a call?
- No. - Why not?

8
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,380
l quit, remember?

9
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,580
You look alright now.

10
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,980
l am alright.

11
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,780
lf you can't look anymore,
l understand.

12
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
Don't play games with me!

13
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,380
lf l really didn't need you,
l wouldn't ask.

14
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,380
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
l have three weeks till full moon.

15
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,980
We have a better chance
if you help me.

16
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,580
l'll think about it.

17
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,980
Stay and eat.

18
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,780
- Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
- Yep.

19
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,780
- How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- ln this hatchery?

20
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,180
40 or 50 of 'em.

21
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,480
- Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.

22
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,780
These are all gonna make it.

23
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,780
What about the dogs?

24
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,380
No. That's why
we buried the wire down in the sand.

25
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,680
l need more staples, pal.

26
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,080
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?

27
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,980
lf he decides to do it, Molly,

28
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,380
l'll keep him
as far away from it as l can.

29
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,480
- We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.

30
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,880
All that happened before
lets you know that.

31
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,980
lf l went back,
l'd only look at the evidence.

32
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,580
l wouldn't get involved.

33
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,580
He'd never even see me.

34
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,880
lf they find him,
they'll have to take him down.

35
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,880
What do you think?

36
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,580
You've already decided
and you're not really asking.

37
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,680
lf l were asking?

38
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,180
Stay here with me.

39
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,080
Me and Kevin.

40
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,680
That's selfish and l know it.

41
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,980
l'll come inside with you
and show you around.

42
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,780
- Mr.Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.

43
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,480
There's a VCR in your hotel room.

44
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,880
There's home movies
of both families on half inch VHS.

45
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,280
Thanks.

46
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,480
lntruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.

47
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,780
Entry was skilful.

48
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,680
All prints are smooth gloves.

49
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,280
Blond hair, strong.

50
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
Size 12 shoe imprint.

51
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,680
Blood AB positive, from saliva
on glass from the suction cup.

52
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,380
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?

53
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,180
lt was hot that night,

54
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,080
so it must have felt
cool in the house.

55
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,180
lntruder cut Charles Leeds's throat
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

56
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,180
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine,
but she died of strangulation.

57
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,080
Moderate elevation of serotonin and
an increase in histamine indicate she

58
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,780
lived for 5 minutes after the shot.

59
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,180
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the

60
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,280
blood stains on the wall
indicate arterial spray.

61
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,380
Leeds tried to fight because intruder
moved towards the children's room.

62
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,580
Blood stains on west wall

63
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,480
in master bedroom and sliding marks
on hall carpet remain unexplained,

64
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,180
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr. Leeds' chest.

65
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,880
Also believed post-mortem.

66
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,980
What did the killer
do with them after they were dead?

67
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,380
Hi. This is Valerie Leeds.

68
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,580
l can't speak right now,

69
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,380
but if you leave a message after the
beep, l'll get right back.

70
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,780
290th floor.

71
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
Going up.

72
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,780
When they were dead,

73
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,380
he smashed the mirrors and
selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.

74
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,580
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children
would take less than a minute.

75
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,580
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were
post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.

76
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,780
What did he do in the interval?

77
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,780
He smeared blood stains on the wall.

78
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,680
- Hello?
- Molly?

79
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,580
- Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.

80
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,380
Look, l'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.

81
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,180
l love you.
- l love you too, baby.

82
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,780
What are you dreaming?

83
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,580
That's something you can't afford
for me to know about.

84
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,980
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

85
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,780
lr was maddening to touch her
with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?

86
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,580
They found talcum powder on her leg,
but there wasn't any in the bathroom.

87
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,180
lt came out of a rubber glove
as you pulled it off to touch her.

88
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,180
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?

89
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,380
You touched her with your bare hands

90
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,780
and then you put your gloves back on!

91
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,580
But while your gloves were off,

92
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,280
did you open all their eyes
so they could see you?

93
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,180
Hallo?
- Jack, this is Graham.

94
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,180
- ls Price still in Latent Prints?
- Yeah, the Single Print lndex.

95
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,180
- What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.

96
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
- Atlanta P.D.dusted everything and
they're good. - Not as good as Price.

97
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,780
l'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?

98
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,480
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails
and the corneas of all their eyes.

99
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,166
l think he took off his gloves.

100
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:07,338
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves
the whole time. They dusted everything.

101
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:09,882
The report didn't mention nails.

102
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,012
Why do you think he took his gloves off?

103
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,384
Because  Mrs Leeds was a beautiful woman.

104
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,730
This is what the subject's teeth look like.

105
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,228
The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these,

106
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:25,490
from the impressions we took of bite
marks off the Leeds woman here,

107
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,007
and off the Jacobi woman in Birmingham,
last month.

108
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,620
As you can see,he has pegged lateral
incisors,that's these teeth here and here.

109
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,920
Vice and narcotics, you take the
K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.

110
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,020
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the
funeral. The rest, see the sheet.

111
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,820
One more thing.

112
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,020
l've heard officers reffering
this killer as the 'Tooth Fairy'.

113
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,920
Well, l don't wanna hear that in
public or see it in inetrnal memoranda!

114
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,620
That's it.

115
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,620
l know a burglar's gonna fence
what he stole for cash money.

116
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,020
l know his motive,
so l go to work on fences.

117
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,620
This guy, we don't have a motive.

118
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,820
None of us have shit and we know it.

119
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,520
lt's in his dreams.

120
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,320
His motive?
- Yeah.

121
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,620
His act fuels his fantasy.

122
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,720
Which is?
- l don't know.

123
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,520
Commissioner says you're the one
who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes

124
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,220
and then Dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 9 people, didn't he?

125
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:46,951
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.

126
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:48,929
What happened to them?

127
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:53,883
One is on respirator at a hospital in Baltimore
and other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.

128
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:56,538
What did psychologist say was wrong with Lektor?

129
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:03,082
Psychologist call him a 'psychopath'.
They don't know what else to call him.

130
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:09,148
l understand he cut you pretty good.

131
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:14,673
What about the dog?

132
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,050
lt's at the vet's. The kid bought
it with a puncture wound in the abdomen.

133
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,150
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat.

134
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,850
That's right.

135
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,350
We found the litter box,
downstairs but not the cat.

136
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,650
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D.
a methane probe out of washington and

137
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,750
cover the backyard,maybe
the cat's dead and the kids buried it.

138
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,250
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie Price, FBl.

139
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,650
- Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am l talking to?

140
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,850
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford
you got Will Graham here.

141
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,850
l got a partial print,
probably a thumb.

142
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,650
And a fragment of a palm off the
nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.

143
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,038
Thumb print came off the
oldest kid's left eye.

144
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,500
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage
from the gunshot wound.

145
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,070
- Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.

146
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:08,444
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.

147
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:09,889
Thanks Jimmie!

148
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,476
lf we get lucky with that print ...

149
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:33,978
- lf Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, Graham!

150
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,912
Whatta you say?
lt's me, Lounds, from the "Tattler".

151
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,944
l did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?

152
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:44,084
- l'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!

153
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,815
l'm doing my job.

154
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:48,724
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?

155
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:51,815
How does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, Will?

156
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:57,856
- Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, Will!

157
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,650
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital
while l was sedated and took pictures.

158
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,650
- l know.
- Don't expect too much from me.

159
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:16,315
We only got three weeks left.

160
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:19,038
What'd you think l'm just gonna see him
standing in the streets, say there he is?

161
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,682
That's Houdini you're thinking about!

162
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,050
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on till
we get smart or lucky. He won't stop.

163
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,650
Why?

164
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,350
- He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.

165
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,350
Not enough.

166
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,850
l'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.

167
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,450
Why?

168
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,150
Recover the mind set.

169
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,250
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court 3 years ago.

170
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,450
l keep getting it for Christmas.

171
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,950
- Did you get my card?
- l got it, thank you.

172
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,450
How is Officer Stuart? The one
who was the first to see my basement.

173
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,050
- Stuart's fine.
- Emotional problems, l hear.

174
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,050
- Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.

175
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,650
No, of course you don't.

176
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,050
l'm glad you came.

177
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,650
My callers are usually psychologists
from cornfield universities.

178
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,450
Second-raters, the lot.

179
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,750
- Dr. Bloom showed me your article
on surgical addiction. - And?

180
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,450
Very interesting, even to a layman.

181
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,550
- l want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
- l thought so.

182
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,957
- lt's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?

183
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:15,926
- You read about it?
- ln the papers, l don't tear out the articles.

184
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:19,144
l wouldn't want them to think
l was dwelling on anything morbid.

185
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,750
You want to know how he's
choosing them. Don't you?

186
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:27,400
- I thought you might have some ideas?
- Why should l tell you?

187
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:29,118
You get to see the file in this case.

188
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:31,442
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.

189
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:33,319
I thought you might be curious,

190
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,298
to see if you're smarter than
the person I'm looking for.

191
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,902
Then by implication, you think that you're
smater than me, since you caught me?

192
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:41,496
- No, l know l'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?

193
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:43,686
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?

194
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:45,751
You're insane.

195
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,950
You're very tanned, Will.

196
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,850
Your hands are rough.

197
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,424
They don't look like cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is something,

198
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:00,902
child desreve.
With a ship on the bottle?

199
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,350
Don't think you can persuade me with
appeals to my intellectual vanity.

200
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,250
I don't think I'll persuade you.

201
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,150
You'll do it or you won't.

202
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,250
Bloom is working an it anyway,
and he's the best.

203
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:18,509
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.

204
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,925
- Pictures?
- Yes.

205
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,300
Let me have them and l'll consider it.
- No.

206
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,250
Dream much, Will?

207
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,350
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.

208
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,750
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.

209
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,850
Let me have the file
and l'll tell you what l think.

210
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,250
This is a very shy boy.

211
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:46,950
- What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges. Why?

212
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,550
Because, my dear Will,

213
00:25:49,043 --> 00:25:52,177
if this pilgrim imagines he has a
relationship with the moon,

214
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,514
he might outside and look at it.

215
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,950
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
lt appears quite black.

216
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,250
lf one were nude, it would be better to
have privacy for this sort of thing.

217
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,850
That's interesting.

218
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,650
- No,It's not. You thought of it before.
- l considered it.

219
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,969
You came here to look at me, Will.

220
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,357
- To get the old scent again, didn't you?
- l want your opinion.

221
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,014
- I don't have one right now.
- When you do have one I'd like to hear it.

222
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,774
- Can l keep this?
- Haven't decided.

223
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:25,869
l'll study them. When you get more files.
i'll like to see them too.  You can call me,

224
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:27,878
When I have to call my lawyer,
they bring me a telephone.

225
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,000
Would you like to give me your
home phone number?

226
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:32,226
No.

227
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:35,388
Do you know how you caught me?

228
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:37,408
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave
messages for me at the number on the file.

229
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:38,715
Do you know how you caught me?

230
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,216
The reason you caught me, Will,

231
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,432
because we're just alike.
You want the scent,

232
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,794
smell yourself!

233
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,250
Gotcha!

234
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,850
Get up and face the wall.

235
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,750
Don't turn around,
or l'll mace you in the face.

236
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,650
Thank you so much.
l'll call when l'm finished.

237
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,350
- You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.

238
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,950
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub,
Law Offices.

239
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,050
l'm sorry, l misdialed.

240
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,550
Thank you for using AT & T.
This is Operator 24.

241
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,350
Operator,
l don't have the use of my arms.

242
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,850
- Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly. What's the number?

243
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,550
Area code 3-0-1-5-5-5

244
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,010
6-6-2-4.

245
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,219
University of Chicago,
Department of Psychiatry.

246
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,296
Dr Sidney Bloom, please.

247
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,709
l'll connect you with his office.

248
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,132
- What's his secretary's name?
- Martha King. Just a moment.

249
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,450
- Martha King's desk.
- Hi, Martha.

250
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,989
Martha doesn't come in nights.

251
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:54,641
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer
of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company.

252
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:58,393
Dr. Bloom asked me to send send a copy of 'The psychiatrist and the Law' to someone.

253
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,770
Martha never sent me the address
phone number.

254
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,054
She'll be in in the morning.

255
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:05,831
l've got to catch the Federal express
within about five minutes.

256
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,753
I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.

257
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,534
She doesn't have a Rolodex.

258
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,499
I'll bet she has a call caddy next to her phone.

259
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:13,659
Yeah.

260
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,768
Well, zip that little Pointer right on
down to the letter G.

261
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:18,007
Alright!

262
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,909
The name we're looking for,
last name Graham.

263
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:24,850
The man this book is supposed to send to.
Mr. Will Graham.

264
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,721
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation,
10th and Pennsylvania, Washington D. C.

265
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:33,428
Now l'll bet his home address is
there too.

266
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:36,894
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.

267
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,861
Thank you very much.

268
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,643
I've Finished!

269
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,450
- Mommy!
- Oh my gosh! It's alright. Stewardess?

270
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,590
You cut the branch so you could see.

271
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,790
Then you passed the time whittling

272
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,690
and dreaming.

273
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,990
When night came,

274
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,790
you saw them behind bright windows.

275
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,790
You watched the shades go down,

276
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,990
saw the lights go out one by one.

277
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:03,407
And after a while, you climbed down and
you went in to them,

278
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:04,402
didn't ya?

279
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:07,882
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them allgoddamn day long!

280
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,972
That's why houses with big yards.

281
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:22,490
l need the Firearms and Toolmarks
Section on the severed branch.

282
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,090
l need Bowman to fall on this carving.
- ls it weird?

283
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,390
The mark? Yeah.

284
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:32,990
lf Documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did Price get an identification?

285
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,505
No, not yet.
lt's a hand search.

286
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,990
Have you seen the "Tattler"?

287
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,290
- lt's not on my preffered reading list.
- Yeah, well,

288
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,890
you're all over the front page.

289
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,390
- Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?

290
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,890
Goddammit, Jack!
l promised Molly.

291
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,890
- Come in!
- Dr. Chilton? - Yes?

292
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,790
On cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell,
he hid something in a book.

293
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,590
- We dug around.
- ls that it? Put it down.

294
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,190
- Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.

295
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,590
- Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton. Mr. Graham please!

296
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,190
He's not here. Mr. Crawford
is on the line with him now.

297
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,590
Will you tell him this is very, very
urgent. I'll hold on.

298
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,790
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.

299
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,690
l have two pieces of a note

300
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,790
that appears to be from man who
killed those people in Atlanta.

301
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,690
- Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.

302
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,390
- Don't touch the note. Read it to us!
- lt's on toilet tissue.

303
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,490
"Dear Dr. Lecktor,

304
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,490
l am delighted that
you've taken an interest in me.

305
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,290
You alone can understand
what l am becoming.

306
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,390
You know the people l used to help me

307
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,390
are only elements undergoing change
to fuel the radiance

308
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,890
of what l am becoming. Just
as the source of light is burning.

309
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,890
My collection of your press clippings
is as absurd as are mine.

310
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,790
The "Tooth Fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?

311
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,890
lnvestigator Graham interests me.

312
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,390
Very purposeful-looking.
l hope we can correspond."

313
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,790
There's a piece missing.
l'll read the bottom part.

314
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,990
"After l hear from you,
l might send you something wet."

315
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:51,290
Signed: "Avid fan."
There are teeth marks at the bottom.

316
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:54,610
Sarah, order a chopper, the next
thing smoking and I don't care whose.

317
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:58,208
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard,
get Graham back here right now.

318
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:02,190
Call Documents and scramble a team.
l want everybody movin' five minutes.

319
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,090
The Documents team are on helicopter
to pick up the note.

320
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,190
Listen, l wanna replace the note.
l don't want Lecktor to know.

321
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,690
- He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor now? - Holding cell.

322
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:16,421
How long can you keep him in there
without him getting suspicious?

323
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,862
Three, four hours

324
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,390
Brian, We have a note coming in,
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.

325
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:25,552
No.1 Priority. Has to go to Hair and Fiber
Latent Prints and Documents.

326
00:38:25,552 --> 00:38:27,403
Graham and I will be walking it through...

327
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,590
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.

328
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,790
- Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.

329
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,990
- What do you have as a negative
comparison? - Lecktor's comb.

330
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,390
Whiskers from a razor,
hair from the Security Guard.

331
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,690
How many handled this without gloves?

332
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,090
- Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks

333
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,190
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

334
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,390
But the others ...one smudge.

335
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,390
No ridges,
it's just the texture of the paper.

336
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,090
- l can fume it but l can't say the
iodine stains will fade.- Ninhydrin?

337
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,890
- Boosted with heat?
- No. You couldn't wash it out.

338
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,190
l can't get a print in the time.

339
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,790
- How long?
- 20 minutes max.

340
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,390
Main thing is,
how was Lecktor supposed to reply?

341
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:23,190
lt's probably in the missing section.
'l hope we can correspond'.

342
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,190
Then comes the gap.

343
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,590
This note was written in ballpoint.

344
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,790
But it looks like Lecktor went over
this area with a felt-tip pen

345
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,990
and tore it away.

346
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,990
You're so sly,

347
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,590
but so am l.

348
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,190
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens,

349
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,690
like Lecktor used,
are transparent to infrared.

350
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,190
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.

351
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,290
This looks like the tip of a T.

352
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,790
This one could be

353
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,190
the top of an R.
- Three T's and an R in "Tattler".

354
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,790
The article about me and Lecktor.

355
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,990
No-one else carried that.

356
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,890
Personal ads.

357
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,790
The Tooth Fairy told Lecktor
to reply through the Personal ads

358
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,390
in the "Tattler". Chicago is running
through them right now.

359
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,490
Here is a line of communication
between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.

360
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:06,090
lf we find Lecktor's answer,
we'll replace it with our own.

361
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,290
This is what he'll read:

362
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,890
"Dear Avid Fan: lnherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.

363
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,990
Mementos for you at Baltimore Central.
Left luggage.

364
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,590
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."

365
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,790
lt's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.

366
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,590
- Anything from Chicago? - Not yet.
- When do they go to press?

367
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,190
- ln 35 minutes. - Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.

368
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,090
- There was no print.
- The core size of the hair

369
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:38,590
matches the blond hair found in the
Jacobi's. Your man wrote the note.

370
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,190
Three blue grains
went to Brians's end.

371
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,590
Commercial granulated cleanser
from the cleaning man.

372
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,190
Particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

373
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,790
- This is Chester, who's there?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

374
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,390
- Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan"
in it. - Read it!

375
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,690
"Dear Avid Fan,
you honor me. You're very beautiful.

376
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,590
One hundred prayers for your safety.

377
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,590
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.

378
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,290
Acts 3,3; Revelations 18,7.

379
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:20,290
Jonah 6,8; John 6,22; Luke 1,7.

380
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,690
Thanks.

381
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,890
Jimmie,

382
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,690
- Get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.

383
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,390
- Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.

384
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,990
No.

385
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,790
Our ad has to go out
in the same book code, or he'll know.

386
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,190
Book code?

387
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,890
"100 prayers" could be a page number
and the paired numbers lines.

388
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,990
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.

389
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,390
Lecktor was not using the Bible.

390
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,090
The Tooth Fairy probably named
the book in the part torn out.

391
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,890
What about sweatin' Lecktor?

392
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,290
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago,

393
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,890
and he gave 'em a recipe for
a chip dip. - Wonderful.

394
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:30,090
The Tooth Fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.

395
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,590
Willingham took Polaroids
of Lecktor's cell.

396
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:39,090
- Have him meet me.
- Where? - Library of Congress.

397
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,190
25 minutes. He won't make it.

398
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,690
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
or we pull it

399
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,990
and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!

400
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,590
l don't like Lecktor's ad running
without knowing what it says.

401
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,090
lt's your call, Will.

402
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,390
Run it.

403
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,990
And what if it encourages the
Tooth Fairy to do something else?

404
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,890
Then we'll all feel sick.

405
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,190
And if Bowman can't figure it out?

406
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,490
- Then we'll bait him with something
else in the "Tattler". - What?

407
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,290
Me.

408
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,790
That's not a very good idea.

409
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,490
- Why not? Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe, He can be provoked.

410
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,590
l was thinking about as you.

411
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,490
You're getting in deeper and deeper.

412
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,490
Sidney?

413
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,790
The last time

414
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,890
you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again,

415
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,990
or if you go through some trauma,
you could relapse.

416
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,890
Sidney, don't worry about me.

417
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,190
l'm workin' the evidence,
makin' moves, that's all.

418
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,990
l'm fine.

419
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:11,490
Bowman says
it is not books in Lecktor's cell.

420
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,190
- Price?
- lt's a bust out.

421
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,190
The Leeds' print will
get us a conviction.

422
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,090
He must never have been printed,

423
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:21,990
because he is not in our index.

424
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,990
We are not gonna
identify him off the print.

425
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,290
l'll use Lounds.

426
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,490
What for?

427
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:37,090
Our boy doesn't read the Times.
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler".

428
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,190
- What else should we cover? - He put
the shorts on Leeds after he was dead,

429
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,990
so we wouldn't think he was gay.

430
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,890
He molested all his male victims

431
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,290
and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists

432
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,590
have projected

433
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,390
that he may have had
sexual relations with his mother.

434
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,790
- How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the Tooth Fairy.

435
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,790
Will the "Tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?

436
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,190
Mine? It doesn't.
lt affects yours! Fuck yourself!

437
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,190
- Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.

438
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:32,390
- Alright. I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What? - Yeah. Come on!

439
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,390
You want this to look real?

440
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,590
Make sure the theater sign
is just out of focus.

441
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,190
- We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!

442
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,290
Shoot it!

443
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,290
One more.

444
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,490
- One more.
- That's enough.

445
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,990
OK, Graham. Always nice, huh?

446
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:56,690
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.

447
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,590
- Dr. Bloom. I need them
on my desk in 2 hours. - OK.

448
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,890
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.

449
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,890
They say the cutting tool
was a common bolt cutter.

450
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,490
l got a call
from Asian Studies in Langley.

451
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:24,290
The mark on the tree is a Chinese
lucky sign in gambling.

452
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,190
The same character appears in
Mah-jongg. It means Red Dragon.

453
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,190
Mean anything to you?

454
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:34,690
No.

455
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,690
lf he shows and he's smart,
he'll approach from the front,

456
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,890
pass, turn and try and take you from
behind. How's your hearing? - Good.

457
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,190
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.

458
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,390
Checked out a 44 Special Bulldog?
Load these in it.

459
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:57,723
- You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?

460
00:48:57,723 --> 00:49:01,349
Number 12 shot in liquid Teflon in
a copper casing.

461
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,566
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.

462
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,690
- You got body armor?
- Kevlar Second Chance.

463
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,490
- Hope you get one.
- Cause he goes for the head shot?

464
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,490
Let's walk the route.

465
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:42,490
United Flight 8490 to Newark
now boarding at gate 7.

466
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:45,990
United Flight 8490 to Newark
now boarding at gate 7.

467
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,780
Someone's coming.

468
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,630
Go!

469
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,880
Don't!

470
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,480
Don't move!

471
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,380
Take the money!

472
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,180
Don't shoot!

473
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,580
Clear!

474
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,580
Quicker, man!
l'm being mugged!

475
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,780
- Do you know who l am?
- l don't wanna know who you are.

476
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,780
You said l'm a sexual pervert.

477
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,880
'An animal' you said.

478
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,180
Do you know who l am now?

479
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,180
Yes.

480
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,680
Do you feel privileged?

481
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,780
l'm very scared.

482
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,680
Open your eyes!

483
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.

484
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,580
That's why you're here.

485
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,780
Open your eyes or l'll staple
your eyelids to your forehead.

486
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,880
Well, here l ...

487
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,380
am.

488
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,480
Look at the screen.

489
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,780
William Blake's

490
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,180
'The Great Red Dragon' and 'The
Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun'.

491
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,780
- Do you see?
- Yes.

492
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,880
- Mrs. Leeds. Do you see?
- Yes.

493
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,680
- Mrs. Jacobi. Do you see?
- Yes.

494
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,480
- The next family as they will look.
Do you see? - Yes.

495
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,780
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.

496
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,080
Yes.

497
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,880
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.

498
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,780
The Dragon rampant.

499
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,580
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph.

500
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,180
- No! - No what?
- Not me, please!

501
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,980
- Please!
- Are you a man? - Yes.

502
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,480
- Do you imply that l'm queer?
- God, no!

503
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,080
Before me you are a slug in the sun.

504
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,280
You are privy to a great becoming
and you recognise nothing!

505
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,080
You are an ant in the afterbirth!

506
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,380
lt is your nature
to do one thing correctly... tremble.

507
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,580
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others

508
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,080
owe me awe!

509
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,780
One more piece of work to do.

510
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,780
lf he takes off the mask,
l'm dead now!

511
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,180
Open your eyes.

512
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,380
Open your eyes!

513
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,180
Read this into the tape recorder.

514
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,580
Go.

515
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,680
"l have seen with wonder and awe
the strength of the Red Dragon.

516
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,080
All l wrote about him were lies.

517
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,580
Will Graham made me write them
to pull him into a trap.

518
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,580
Will Graham, you will learn how much
you have to dread, because l lied.

519
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,680
He will be more merciful to me.

520
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,980
You will lie awake in fear of what
the Red Dragon will do.

521
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,380
l will testify to the truth of this."

522
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,580
You did very well.

523
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,380
Will you let me go now? Please?

524
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,380
- You will tell the truth?
- l promise.

525
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,780
Good.

526
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,380
We'll seal your promise with ...

527
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,580
We'll seal your promise

528
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,580
with a kiss.

529
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,480
Only five answers are possible.

530
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:39,380
Any member of a team
may buzz in and answer.

531
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,480
Bowman,

532
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,380
skip the cryptography
and tell me what it says!

533
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,180
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.

534
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,380
- He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape? - Yes. Listen,

535
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,880
Bowman just broke Lecktor's code
in the personal ad.

536
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,380
- lt's the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know, now. - What?

537
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,280
Listen to me. Everything's okay.
l've taken care of it.

538
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,180
What is it, Jack?

539
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,980
The bastard gave him your address.

540
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,980
lt said: "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto
Highway, Captiva, Florida."

541
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,380
Save yourself. Kill them all.

542
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,680
- Get me a plane!
- Will! Will!

543
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,180
Mom?

544
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,380
Huh? What?

545
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,280
Someone's outside.

546
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,780
- l hear noises.
- Where? - Outside.

547
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,180
Go back to your room
and close the door.

548
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,080
- Mom?
- Do it, now!

549
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,680
- Mom, are you alright?
- What? What is it?

550
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,680
What is it? What's going on?

551
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,780
Come back inside!

552
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,680
- What's going on? - Come inside!
- So what ...? - Come back inside!

553
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,180
l'm sorry, Molly.

554
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,880
l'm sorry about all of this.

555
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,180
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.

556
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:40,180
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- lt's just a precaution.

557
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,980
Kevin? Run down to the water
and check the out dock.

558
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,480
l wanna hang around here.
l'm in the kitchen, mom.

559
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,380
What's that about? He's afraid
to leave you alone with me now?

560
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,480
He saw the article in the "Tattler".

561
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,180
l wanted to talk to him, but he said
he'd bring it up with you.

562
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,980
Good for him.

563
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,580
Kevin, help me unpack
and then we'll get some groceries.

564
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:25,980
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.

565
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,580
ls there anything l need to know,
to see about mom?

566
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,980
No.

567
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,380
- This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.

568
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,180
When you gonna kill him?

569
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,980
l'm not.

570
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,380
lt's only my job to find him.

571
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,580
ln the newspaper it said
you were in a special hospital.

572
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,180
Well, it was a regular hospital,

573
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,280
then l was transferred
to the psychiatric wing.

574
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,480
That bothers you, doesn't it?

575
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,580
l don't know.

576
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:14,380
Was it because of this man Lecktor?

577
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,180
What happened?

578
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,580
Lecktor attacked
college girls and he killed them.

579
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:23,580
How?

580
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,180
ln bad ways.

581
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,480
He was a psychiatrist.

582
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,980
One of the girls was his patient
and l went to talk to him about her.

583
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,980
l tried to build up feelings
like the killer had,

584
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,180
so l would know why he did it 'cause
that would help me find him.

585
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,980
l was sitting in Lecktor's office

586
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:54,780
and saw a book on a shelf
with pictures of war wounds.

587
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,780
And l knew it was him.

588
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,280
So l went to a pay phone
to call the police.

589
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,680
That's when he attacked me.

590
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,980
You and mom ...

591
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,780
came to see me in hospital
and that helped a lot.

592
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,180
But after my body got OK,

593
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,180
l still had his thoughts in my head.

594
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,980
l stopped talking to people.

595
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,280
A doctor friend, Dr. Bloom
asked me to get help,

596
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,980
and l did.

597
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,780
And after a while l felt better
and l was OK again.

598
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,280
And the way you thought ...
felt that bad?

599
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,180
Kevin,

600
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,780
the ugliest thoughts in the world.

601
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,780
What kind of coffee you like?

602
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,980
What?

603
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:16,580
- You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.

604
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,780
Mom too.

605
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,580
- When can we go home, Dad?
- l don't know, Kevin.

606
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,180
So where are things?

607
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,280
Nowhere.

608
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,180
Everything we've tried
is a dead end or has backfired.

609
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,380
Crawford is planning
the next crime scene.

610
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,580
- Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?

611
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,780
No.

612
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,180
What's next?

613
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,380
- l go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?

614
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,980
No.

615
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,680
l have to be alone.

616
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:32,580
- You're talking about doing exactly what ...
- This killing ...

617
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,580
... it's gotta stop!

618
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:05,480
William, you're going to make
yourself sick, or get killed.

619
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,980
You and Kevin should go to Montana,

620
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,580
see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.

621
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,180
l'll come and get you afterwards.

622
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,780
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
l'm sorry l can't come to the phone.

623
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,780
- l'm sorry too.
- Excuse me? - Coffee.

624
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,680
Just you and me now, sport.

625
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,980
l'm gonna find you, Goddammit!

626
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,780
- Mr. Dollarhyde? - Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation

627
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,180
in the gamma number 3,

628
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,780
but he caught it in time.

629
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,680
Good.

630
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,180
Good.

631
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,680
- Who's there?
- Mr. Dollarhyde.

632
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,280
- l came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in. It's safe.

633
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,380
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.

634
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,680
You're the production controller?

635
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,680
- What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.

636
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,380
- l can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?

637
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:26,780
- Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?

638
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,680
- ln four days.
- OK. l'll stick this in a black bag.

639
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:39,080
- 1000 C infrared, sensitive
has to be handled in total darkness.

640
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:44,280
Remember to be careful.
lt's easier than the 1200 series.

641
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:49,380
- Fine. - ln case you're wondering,
l keep the samples by touch.

642
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,380
l was wondering ...

643
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,580
l gotta fly. Perhaps
Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home.

644
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,980
No, that's OK.
No thanks. Go on.

645
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:10,880
- l'll take you. - No thanks.
- l'll order 1200ft of 1000 C tomorrow.

646
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:15,680
- Ride with me!
- No thanks! I'll take the bus.

647
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:20,180
Ride with me!
l would like you to.

648
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,180
OK, sure. I'll just get my stuff on.

649
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,880
How did you come to Gateway?

650
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,380
They had to hire the handicapped

651
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:35,580
to get this Defense contract.
- You worked out well.

652
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,380
Everybody they hired did.

653
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,280
You speak very well, although you
avoid fricatives and sibilants.

654
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,080
l trained in therapy for speech
and hearing-impaired children.

655
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,580
l'll probably go back to it someday.

656
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:58,480
lf you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
You're very direct, l like that.

657
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,780
l like what you have to say.

658
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,380
May l touch your face?

659
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,580
Are you smiling or frowning?

660
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:11,680
l guess l wanna know
whether l should be quiet or not.

661
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,580
Take my word for it,

662
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,880
- l'm smiling.
- l didn't mean to offend you.

663
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:28,280
- Can l take you somewhere?
- Where?

664
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,080
lt will be my surprise.

665
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,980
OK. Sure.

666
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,780
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.

667
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:56,980
- The protective Mr. Dollarhyde is
watching us. - l want to!

668
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,380
ln about two hours
we're going to cap his tooth.

669
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,980
lt's warm.

670
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,580
There ...

671
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,380
Hear it?

672
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,380
You ...

673
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:53,580
rearrange the dead families
into an audience.

674
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,180
You think what you do makes
you into something different.

675
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,180
You're becoming ...

676
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,480
What is it you're becoming?

677
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:11,080
The answer is in the way
you use the mirrors.

678
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,780
What do the mirrors make you dream?

679
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,980
A little to your left.

680
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,880
Francis, that was a great dinner.

681
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,780
There's a gin and tonic,
right in front of you.

682
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,580
What are you watching?

683
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,380
A little homework.

684
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,580
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.

685
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:01,380
Your heart's loud

686
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,580
if you love me.

687
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,780
ls that you, D.?
- Are you OK? - Yeah, l'm fine.

688
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,980
- Morning.
- Morning.

689
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:52,980
- lf you show me,
l'll make us some coffee - No!

690
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:57,580
- Don't go back inside the house.
- l left my purse inside.

691
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,080
l'll get it, it's OK.

692
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:09,680
l mean, you should stay outside.

693
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,680
You look so good in the sun.

694
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,180
When ...

695
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,480
Reba, when can l see you again?

696
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,780
We could meet at my house.

697
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,180
You got the message Lecktor called?

698
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,880
Yeah. L'll call him in a few minutes.

699
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,580
We identified the tire tracks when
Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".

700
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:04,080
G-7816, Goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.

701
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:07,280
l'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?

702
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,180
When l'm done, Jack.

703
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:29,980
Will Graham of the FBl.
l'd like to talk to Dr. Lecktor.

704
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,180
Hello?

705
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,680
Hello, Will.

706
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,780
Congratulations on the job
you did on Mr. Lounds.

707
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:46,580
l admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.

708
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:50,280
l'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!

709
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,080
l want to help you.

710
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,080
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures,

711
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:00,880
they're issued to us with our lungs
and pancreas and everything else.

712
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,780
Why fight it?

713
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:04,780
Fight what?

714
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:09,880
Did you really feel depressed
after you shot Hobbes to death?

715
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,180
l think you probably did.

716
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,780
But it wasn't the act that got to you.

717
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:21,380
Didn't you feel so bad,
because killing him felt so good.

718
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:25,680
lt must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.

719
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,580
God's terrific.

720
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,580
He dropped a church roof
on 34 worshippers last Wednesday,

721
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:34,980
while groveling through a hymn.

722
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,180
Don't you think that felt good?

723
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,380
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?

724
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:48,580
lt feels good, because God has power.

725
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,780
lf one does
what God does, enough times,

726
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,980
one will become as God is.

727
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,180
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.

728
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,180
He got 140 Phillipinos
in one plane crash last year.

729
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:10,780
Remember that earthquake
in ltaly last spring?

730
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,720
l enter.

731
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,420
The glass cutter.

732
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:22,420
The piece of glass is mine.

733
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:24,620
The house is mine.

734
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,120
l walk up these stairs,

735
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,120
l pass the children's toys.

736
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,620
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.

737
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:49,679
I moved to the door.

738
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,020
l step into the room.

739
01:25:00,101 --> 01:25:01,443
l see you there.

740
01:25:05,151 --> 01:25:07,276
l see me desired by you.

741
01:25:09,788 --> 01:25:10,659
Accepted

742
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,351
and loved.

743
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,346
ln the silver mirrors

744
01:25:18,523 --> 01:25:19,378
of your eyes.

745
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,916
l'll talk to you tomorrow.

746
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,337
OK.

747
01:26:32,347 --> 01:26:33,740
Wait a minute.

748
01:27:31,587 --> 01:27:33,969
- What was it?
- Pollen.

749
01:27:33,969 --> 01:27:36,465
- Oh, Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.

750
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,500
Mr. Dollarhyde.

751
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,200
What are you doing here?

752
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,000
- Who is it?
- lt's me.

753
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,800
- Hallo? Who is it?
- lt's me.

754
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,000
- Francis?
- No.

755
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,800
Not Francis.

756
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,900
Francis is gone.

757
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,700
Francis is gone, forever.

758
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,400
So what do we do?

759
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,300
The dream.

760
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,400
He dreams about being desired.

761
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,300
So he changes people into beings
who want and desire him.

762
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,400
- Changes?
- lt's a word.

763
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,300
Killing and arranging the people
to imitate it.

764
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,200
Lecktor told me something.

765
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,200
lf one does what God does enough
times, one will become as God is.

766
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,100
You put it together,

767
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,800
our boy imitates being wanted and
desired enough times,

768
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,200
he believes he'll become
one who is wanted and desired.

769
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,300
lt'll all come true.

770
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:18,549
It started from abused kid.

771
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:20,751
Battered infant.

772
01:29:22,676 --> 01:29:27,304
- There is something terrible about...
- Are you sympathising?

773
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:33,282
Absolutley, my heart bleeds for him as a child.

774
01:29:33,984 --> 01:29:38,017
Someone took the kid and manufactured the
monster, as the same time as an adult,

775
01:29:38,263 --> 01:29:42,860
he is irredeemable. He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.

776
01:29:43,287 --> 01:29:46,734
As an adult, someone should blow the sick
fuck out of his socks .

777
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,373
Do you thing that's a contradiction, Jack?

778
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:58,243
Does this kind of understanding
make you uncomfortable?

779
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:12,065
What about the mirrors?

780
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,320
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.

781
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:21,520
But he doesn't take anything.

782
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:27,820
He needs souvenirs from the houses,
so he can relive the event.

783
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:33,720
Maybe he records it somehow.

784
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:39,020
So he can see himself accepted
over and over and over again.

785
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,920
- VTR's, Polaroids, stills, what?
- How do l know?

786
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,120
How does he find them?

787
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,320
lf we find out how he found them,
we'll find him.

788
01:30:53,726 --> 01:30:56,029
There is no connection between
the two familes,

789
01:30:56,029 --> 01:30:58,243
- we've done a dozen computer work.
- Jack!

790
01:30:58,632 --> 01:31:02,322
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!

791
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,620
There's selection and design here.
- Look,

792
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:10,020
admit we struck out this month. The Lear
Jet is standing by the basic lab stuff is on it.

793
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,520
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price,
the photographer.

794
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,120
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an
hour and 15 minutes! We get the call, we roll!

795
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:18,894
- This thing'll be fresh!
- lt's not over yet.

796
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:21,355
For Christ sake it's a foregone
conclusion.

797
01:31:21,584 --> 01:31:25,612
lt's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening
tonight. Give it up!

798
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,720
lt's too damn late!
- l gave it up.

799
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,320
Till you showed up
with pictures of two dead families!

800
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,410
Fuckin' right! I did it,
l'd do it again!

801
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:38,542
Great, but don't talk to me
about late, pal!

802
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:40,100
l'll tell you when it's too
fucking late!

803
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,641
until then we go as late as
I wanna take it.

804
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,520
A padlock.

805
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,720
That's why the bolt cutter.

806
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,120
What's that?

807
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:15,527
He used a boltcutter to trim away branch
when he was watching from the woods.

808
01:32:15,907 --> 01:32:17,882
Why didn't he use
the bolt cutter on the garage door?

809
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,220
Because a deadbolt
was there when they were killed.

810
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,820
Donald Jacobis birthday party
was April 14th.

811
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,320
Sometime between April and August
they changed the lock,

812
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,720
but he thought there was a padlock.

813
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:44,520
From the street you can't see
the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.

814
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,420
There's a big, high fence there, but
he was ready with his glass cutter.

815
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,420
Either he was casing far ahead,

816
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,120
and we didn't check back far enough,

817
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,520
or ...

818
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,220
We checked.

819
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:12,520
Metcalf, it's Graham. Ls the Leeds and
Jacobi stuff still there?

820
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,520
Have the guard down there
call me. Do it!

821
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:27,420
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.

822
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:33,020
He brought a bolt cutter, because
he thought there was a padlock.

823
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:39,620
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar,
but you know it's their dog.

824
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,720
You see the woman?

825
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:46,420
The bloom on the woman?

826
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,620
You can see her again and again,
anytime you want.

827
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:56,120
Doggie doesn't have a collar,
but you know it's the Leeds' dog ...

828
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,220
and the Jacobi cat ...

829
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,020
and the padlock on the door.

830
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:08,120
You know you need a bolt cutter and
every other goddamn thing.

831
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,920
Because everything with you is seeing isn't?

832
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:19,320
Your primary sensory intake that
makies your dream live is seeing.

833
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,420
The reflections...

834
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:24,520
mirrors ...

835
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,320
images ...

836
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,320
You've seen these films!

837
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,920
Haven't you, my man?

838
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:52,077
The guard in the storeroom.

839
01:34:52,077 --> 01:34:55,275
- The cans! - What cans?
- The tapes were transferred from home,

840
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,082
Where's the packaging of the films came?

841
01:34:57,082 --> 01:35:00,025
There are films of the families in
document storage, find them.

842
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,520
You got 'em?

843
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,720
Are there any labels?

844
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:11,720
Leeds can, Gateway Lab,
St. Louis, Missouri.

845
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:16,520
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway Lab, St. Louis.

846
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,120
Who processed the Jacobi film?

847
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:24,520
No, Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.

848
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,920
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.

849
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,620
ls there a label underneath?

850
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,820
lt does, doesn't it?

851
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,820
l want a chopper
in three minutes to Meigs Field.

852
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:59,120
At Meigs Field l want
the Lear Jet prepped for St. Louis.

853
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,720
Where are you? Are you here?

854
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,620
You're scaring me!
Stop it!

855
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,220
Francis,

856
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,420
why are you doing this to me?

857
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,220
lt's ugly.

858
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:05,120
Are you in this room?
Where are you?

859
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:08,120
You answer me!

860
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,620
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.

861
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:43,320
We don't have his name,
but we know he drives a van.

862
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,720
l got special stickers for vans.

863
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:51,720
l got 28 van permits here.
- Start feeding me names.

864
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,820
ls this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.

865
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,220
l need you to get the driver's
licenses of these names.

866
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:02,920
The man we're looking for is blond,
Caucasian, 20-40 years old,

867
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:06,920

869
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,420
A-L-V-A-R-O, first name Joseph.

870
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,120
No. Black hair.

871
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,120
No.
- Next.

872
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,820
Dillon, D-l-L-L-O-N.

873
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:29,920
First name Lincoln. - Dillon.
D-l-L-L-O-N, first name Lincoln.

874
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:33,820

34 years old.
- Put it through the data fax. Fast!

878
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,720
Buckle up. We're landing

879
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,720
in Lambert Field.

880
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:24,220
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.

881
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,220
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.

882
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,220
This is our man.

883
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,020
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?

884
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:41,320
We're 10.25 at the Hock Road offramp,
Highway 904.

885
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,420
Let's go!

886
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,020
- Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.

887
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,520
- Lieutenant Fisk said ...
- Go on to the house!

888
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,020
Will?

889
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,920
Will, you won't need that.

890
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,520
The Swat Team
will take him down, not us.

891
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:36,920
Will?

892
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:01,820
- This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!

893
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,520
- Alright? - l'm OK. Griffin's hurt bad.
l'll wait for the backup.

894
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:30,120
Set up a road block on Route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.

895
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:35,320
How far away's the backup?
l'm goin' around the back, stay here.

896
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,920
He's in there, Jack.

897
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,420
Someone is with him.

898
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,720
What?

899
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,320
Will, what did you say?

900
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,320
Wait for the back-up!

901
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,520
He's got someone with him, Jack.

902
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:19,920
Stop it!

903
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,020
Stop it!

904
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:58,720
Who are you?

905
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,520
Graham.

906
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:05,320
l'm Will Graham.

907
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:09,920
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?

908
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,720
lt was on the news.

909
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,820
l thought l'd work things out ...

910
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,720
and call you after.

911
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,820
l thought l wouldn't wait.

912
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:53,620
How many of them made it?

913
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,420
Most of 'em. (Subtitles By Sooraj)
