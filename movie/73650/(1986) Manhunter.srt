1
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,121
We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.

2
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:23,708
I'm not fallin' all over myself
to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.

3
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:27,251
- How much do you know?
- Not much.

4
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:35,423
The Birmingham one was
in the papers over a month ago.

5
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,722
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

6
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,721
- You ever think about givin' me a call?
- No.

7
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,938
- Why not?
- I quit, remember?

8
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,613
You look all right now.

9
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:57,405
I am. All right.

10
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:11,580
If you can't look any more, I understand.

11
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,800
Don't try to run a game
down on me, Jack.

12
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:27,725
If I really didn't need you to come back, I
wouldn't ask. This guy's on a lunar cycle.

13
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:31,355
I have three weeks and a few days
until the next full moon.

14
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:35,731
We have a better chance
to get him fast if you help.

15
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,822
I'll think about it.

16
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,783
Stay and eat.

17
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,753
Hi, Molly.

18
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,889
- Think it'll keep 'em out, Dad?
- Yep.

19
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:56,058
How many turtle eggs
you think are in here?

20
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:59,360
In this hatchery? Just 40 or 50 of 'em.

21
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:05,238
- Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.

22
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:08,370
These are all gonna make it. Guaranteed.

23
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,747
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in?

24
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:19,382
No - they can't dig under, you see. That's
why we bury the wire down in the sand.

25
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,792
I need more staples, pal.

26
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:35,804
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?

27
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:43,771
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.

28
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,879
- We got it pretty good, don't we?
- We have it more than good.

29
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:08,508
All that happened to you before
lets you know that.

30
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:18,347
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.

31
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:21,483
He'd never even see me
or know my name.

32
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,477
If they find him, they'll have
to take him down, not me.

33
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,032
What do you think?

34
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:38,120
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.

35
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,294
If I were asking...

36
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:49,671
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.

37
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,841
But that's selfish, and I know it.

38
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,311
Come here.

39
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,698
I'll come inside with you if you want,
to show you around.

40
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,466
Mr Crawford said
you may wanna be alone...

41
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,635
That's right.

42
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,351
There's a VCR
hooked up in your hotel room.

43
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,856
They transferred some home movies
of both families onto half-inch VHS.

44
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,022
Thanks.

45
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,245
Intruder entered through
kitchen sliding door.

46
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,954
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

47
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,131
His entry was skilful.

48
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,802
All the prints are smooth gloves.

49
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:26,093
Blond hair. Strong.

50
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,264
Size 12 shoe imprint.

51
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:34,482
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva
on glass from licking the suction cup.

52
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:37,811
Why didn't he care
that he left saliva on the glass?

53
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,446
It was hot out that night.

54
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:47,244
So inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

55
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,163
The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat
as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.

56
00:11:56,296 --> 00:12:00,757
The bullet lodged in her lumbar spine,
but she died of strangulation.

57
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,424
Elevation of serotonin and increase of
free histamine level in gunshot wound

58
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:10,597
indicates she lived at least
five minutes after she was shot.

59
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,218
All her other injuries were postmortem.

60
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:18,182
The direction and velocity of bloodstains
on east wall indicate arterial spray.

61
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,394
Even with his throat cut, Leeds fought,

62
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,147
because the intruder was moving
to the children's room.

63
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:30,234
Bloodstains on west wall of master
bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet

64
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,411
remain unexplained,

65
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,914
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr Leeds' chest,

66
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:40,085
also believed to be postmortem.

67
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:47,794
What'd the killer do with them
after they were dead?

68
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:11,992
<i>(phone rings)</i>

69
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:21,704

<i>(no sound on tape)</i>

77
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:10,918
When they were dead,
he smashed the mirrors

78
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:15,134
and began selecting pieces that
he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.

79
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,846
<i>(sighs)</i>

80
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:21,021
Killing Mr Leeds and the children
would take less than a minute.

81
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:26,811
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were postmortem.
Four or five minutes later.

82
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,984
What did he do in the interval?

83
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:37,950
Smeared bloodstains
on the west wall. Uh...

84

<i>(phone rings)</i>

Go back to sleep.

<i>(dialling tone)</i>

90
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,891
What are you dreaming?

91
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:34,437
That's somethin' you can't afford
for me to know about, isn't it?

92
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,238
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

93
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:49,833
It was maddening to have to touch her
with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?

94
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:53,243
They found talcum powder on her leg.

95
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,665
But there wasn't
any talcum powder in the bathroom.

96
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:05,763
The talcum powder came out of a rubber
glove as you pulled it off to touch her.

97
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,013
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?

98
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,518
You son of a bitch, you touched her
with your bare hands!

99
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,058
And then you put your gloves back on.

100
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:19,947
But while your gloves were off,

101
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,442
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see you?

102
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,749
<i>- Crawford.
- Jack.</i>

103
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:42,299
This is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?

104
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,212
<i>Yeah. He's in charge of
the single print index now.</i>

105
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,674
<i>- What do you got, Will?
- Get him to Atlanta.</i>

106
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,645
<i>Atlanta PD say they dusted everything.
Their guy's good.</i>

107
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,222
<i>- He is, but not as good as Price.
- I'll get him on a plane tomorrow.</i>

108
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,397
<i>What do you want him to do?</i>

109
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,571
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger- and toenails,
and the corneas of all their eyes.

110
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,531
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.

111
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,208
Our people swear he wore
surgeon's gloves the whole time.

112
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,374
They dusted everything.

113
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:19,255
Your report didn't mention eyes.

114
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,003
Why do you think he took his gloves off?

115
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,707
Because Mrs. Leeds
was a beautiful woman.

116
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,598
This is what the subject's teeth look like.

117
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:31,296
The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these

118
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,518
from the impressions of the bite marks
on the Leeds woman here

119
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,931
and the Jacobi woman
in Birmingham last month.

120
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,029
As you can see, he has pegged lateral
incisors. That's these teeth here and here.

121
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:50,575
Vice and Narcotics, you take
the KY cowboys and the leather bars.

122
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:55,282
Marcus, Whitman, the funeral. The rest
of you, assignments are on the sheet.

123
00:18:55,416 --> 00:19:00,755
Uh, one more thing. I've heard officers
referrin' to this killer as the "Tooth Fairy".

124
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,335
<i>- (laughter)
- I don't wanna hear that in public.</i>

125
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:07,166
And I don't wanna see it
in internal memoranda. That's it.

126
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:26,070
I know a burglar's gonna fence what
he stole, cos his motive is cash money.

127
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,317
I know his motive,
so I go to work on fences.

128
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,524
This guy, we don't even have motive.

129
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:35,662
None of us have shit, and we know it.

130
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,121
It's in his dreams.

131
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,334
- His motive?
- Yeah.

132
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,869
His act fuels his fantasy.

133
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:47,706
- Which is?
- I don't know.

134
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:52,174
The commissioner was saying that you're
the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes,

135
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:55,057
and then Dr Lecktor three years ago.

136
00:19:55,184 --> 00:20:00,522
- Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
- Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.

137
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:04,775
- What happened to them?
- One's on a respirator, in Baltimore,

138
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,941
one's in a Denver mental hospital.

139
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,902
What'd the psychologist say
was wrong with Lecktor?

140
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,117
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.

141
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,668
I understand he cut you pretty good.

142
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:29,171
What about the dog?

143
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:35,009
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in
with a puncture wound in the abdomen.

144
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,303
- The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat?
- That's right.

145
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:43,219
We found the litter box downstairs
but we didn't find the cat.

146
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:46,558
Why not get Birmingham PD
a methane probe out of Washington?

147
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:51,153
Have 'em cover the back yard. Maybe
the cat's dead and the kids buried it.

It's probably a thumb.</i>

<i>And the fragment of a palm
off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.</i>

154
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,919
<i>The thumbprint
came off the oldest kid's left eye.</i>

<i>It stood out on a hemorrhage
from the gunshot wound.</i>

- Maybe.</i>

No comment.

163

We get lucky with that print, we're in.
If Jimmy can find him in the index,

164
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:50,917
- and if he's ever been printed.
- Will Graham!

165

So, Will, when did they call you in?
I'm buyin' lunch.

168
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:03,382
- Lounds, give it a rest.
- Hey, he's news. I'm doin' my job.

169
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:06,388
How does he compare with Lecktor?
What does he do to 'em?

170
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:09,391
How's he do 'em?
How's he do 'em, Will?

171

He snuck in while
I was sedated after Lecktor.

174
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,324
He pulled back the sheets
and took pictures.

175
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,544
- Yeah, I know.
- Look, don't expect too much from me.

176

We only got three weeks.
You're our best shot.

177
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:38,003
You think I'll see him in the street
and say "There he is"?

178
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,543
That's Houdini you're thinkin' about.

179
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:46,601
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we
get smart or we get lucky. He won't stop.

180
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:49,598
- Why?
- He's got a genuine taste for it.

181
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:52,604
You do know somethin' about him.

182
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,650
Not enough.

183
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,196
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.

184
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,364
Why?

185
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:06,158
Recover the mind-set.

186
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:42,987
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court three years ago.

187

Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.

188

- I got it. Thank you.

189
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,750
And how is Officer Stuart? The one
who was first to see my basement.

190
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,497
- Stuart's fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.

191
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,634
- Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.

192
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:05,800
No. Of course you don't.

193
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:13,055
I'm glad you came. My callers
are mostly clinical psychologists

194
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:17,516
from cornfed universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.

195
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,268
Dr Bloom showed me your article
on surgical addiction.

196
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:24,606
- And?
- Very interesting. Even to a layman.

197
00:24:27,284 --> 00:24:29,822
I want you to help me, Dr Lecktor.

198
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:32,575
Yes. I thought so.

199
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:35,197
- It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?

200
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,872
- You read about it?
- In the papers.

201
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,079
I don't tear out the articles.

202
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:44,294
I wouldn't want them to think
I was dwelling on anything morbid.

203
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:49,549
You want to know
how he's choosing them, don't you?

204
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:52,172
- I thought you'd have ideas.
- Why should I tell you?

205
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,348
You'd get to see the file on this case.

206
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:57,016
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.

207
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,899
I thought you'd want to see
if you're smarter than him.

208
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:02,646
You think you're smarter than me,
since you caught me.

209
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:05,399
No. I know that I'm not smarter than you.

210
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,855
- How did you catch me?
- You had disadvantages.

211
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:10,482
- What disadvantages?
- You're insane.

212
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,286
You're very tan, Will.

213
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,330
Your hands are rough.

214
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:22,544
They don't look like
cop's hands any more.

215
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:25,162
That shaving lotion's
what a child would select.

216
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:28,086
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?

217
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:33,588
Don't think you can persuade me
with appeals to my intellectual vanity.

218
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,760
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.

219
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:38,933
You'll either do it or you won't.

220
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,349
Besides, we have Dr Bloom
working on it. He's the best.

221
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:46,520
- Do you have the file with you? Pictures?
- Yes.

222
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:49,440
- Let me have them and I may consider it.
- No.

223
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,237
- Dream much, Will?
- Goodbye, Dr Lecktor.

224

You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.

225

Let me have the file,

- Big back yards.

229

Fences, hedges. Why?

230
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:19,195
Because, my dear Will,

231
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:22,495
if this pilgrim imagines
he has a relationship with the moon,

232
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:25,079
he might go outside to look at it.

233
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,374
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight, Will?

234
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:31,077
It appears quite black.

235
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:36,256
If one were nude, it would be better
to have privacy for this sort of thing.

236

- That's interesting.
- No, it's not. You thought of it before.

237
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:43,141
- I considered it.
- You came here to look at me.

238

- I want your opinion.

- I haven't decided yet.

watched them all goddamn day long!

298
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:08,777
That's why houses with big yards.

299
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:18,114
I need Firearms and Toolmarks here on a
branch. I need to know what tool he used.

300
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,621
Then I need Bowman
in Documents on this carving.

301
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:22,874
<i>- Is it weird?
- The mark? Yeah.</i>

302
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:25,791
If Documents can't do it,
I'll send it to Langley.

303
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:29,707
- Did Price identify the Leeds print?
- No. He hasn't found him in the index.

304
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:32,299
<i>It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.</i>

305
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,549
<i>Listen, Will,
have you seen this week's Tattler?</i>

306
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:38,684
<i>- It's not on my preferred reading list.
- Yeah, well, uh...</i>

307
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:41,100
Your picture's all over the front page.

308
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:45,766
- Who the hell was it? Lounds?
- Yes. Who else?

309
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:47,941
Goddamn it, Jack!

310
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,024
I promised Molly! I promised her!

311
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,155
- Come in.
- Dr Chilton?

312
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:59,115
- Yes.
- We were cleaning out Dr Lecktor's cell.

313
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:02,533
He heard us coming and hid something in
a book. We got him out and dug around.

314
00:38:02,668 --> 00:38:04,292
- Is that it?
- Yes.

315
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,459
Put it down on my desk.

316
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:17,557
- Has anyone else seen this except you?
- No.

317
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:24,183
<i>- Special Agent Crawford's office.
- This is Dr Chilton.</i>

318
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:27,564
<i>- I need to speak to Mr Graham.
- He's in Birmingham.</i>

319
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:29,732
<i>Agent Crawford is on the line with him.</i>

320
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:34,025
Will you please tell them
this is very, very urgent? I'll hold on.

321
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:39,614
Dr Chilton, it's Crawford.
Will Graham's on the line too.

322
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:44,040
I have a note, or two pieces of a note,
that appears to be from that man

323
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:47,501
- who killed those people in Atlanta.
- Where did you get it?

324
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,954
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell,
hidden in a book.

325
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,877
<i>Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?</i>

326
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:58,051
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr Lecktor,

327
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:02,013
I wanted to tell you I am delighted
that you've taken an interest in me."

328
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:06,309
<i>"I know that you alone
can understand what I am Becoming. "</i>

329
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:10,519
"You alone know the people I use
to help me in these things

330
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:13,522
are only elements undergoing change

331
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:17,487
to fuel the radiance
of what I am Becoming,

332
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:20,369
just as the source of light is burning."

333
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:24,829
"I have a collection
of your press clippings."

334
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:27,827
"I think they are absurd, as are mine."

335
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,957
"The 'Tooth Fairy'.
What could be more inappropriate?"

336
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:37,000
"Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful looking."

337
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:39,507
"I hope we can correspond."

338
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:43,718
Mr Graham, there's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.

339
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:47,676
"After I hear back from you,
I might send you something wet."

340
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:49,852
Signed "Avid Fan".

341
00:39:50,816 --> 00:39:53,188
It has teeth marks
pressed into it at the bottom.

342
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:55,987
Sarah, order a chopper.
I don't care whose it is.

343
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:59,861
2. Call Alabama Air National Guard and
tell 'em to get Graham back here now.

344
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:04,155
Tell Documents to scramble a team.
I want everybody movin' five minutes ago.

345
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:07,573
<i>I have a Documents team on its way
by helicopter to pick up the note.</i>

346
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:10,459
After we work the note,
replace it in Lecktor's cell.

347
00:40:10,585 --> 00:40:14,203
I don't want Lecktor to know we found it.
He might try to warn the killer.

348
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,664
<i>- Where's Lecktor now?
- (Chilton) Holding cell.</i>

349
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,003
<i>- How long can you keep him there?
- Three, four hours.</i>

350
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:25,757
Brian, we have a note coming in, possibly
from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.

351
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:30,637
It must go to Hair and Fibre, Latent Prints
and Documents. Graham and I'll take it.

352
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,514
One hair, Graham. Maybe half an inch.

353
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,763
- A couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.

354
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:22,070
- What we got for negative comparison?
- Hair from Lecktor's comb.

355
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:27,192
Whiskers from the electric razor they let
him use. Hair from the security guard.

356
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:52,222
- How many handled this without gloves?
- Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.

357
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:57,642
Cleanup man, scrubbing sinks. Probably
had the oil washed off his fingers.

358
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:00,395
But the others... One smudge.

359
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:08,696
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.

360
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,195
I can fume for a print, but can't
say the iodine stains'd fade out.

361
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,790
- Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat?
- No, we couldn't wash it after.

362
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:20,203
I can't get a print off this
in the time you've got to get it back.

363
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:23,128
- How long do I have?
- 20 minutes, max.

364
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:26,922
The main thing to find out is,
how is Lecktor supposed to reply to him?

365
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:31,964
Which is probably the missing section.
It says "I hope we can correspond."

366
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,139
Then comes the gap.

367
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:37,896
This note was written in ballpoint.

368
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:43,182
It looks like Lecktor went over this area
with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.

369
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:16,137
You're so sly, but so am I.

370
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:28,485
The aniline dyes used in the ink
of felt-tip pens like Lecktor used

371
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:30,939
are transparent to infrared.

372
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:33,363
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.

373
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:45,043
Looks like the tip of a T
here, here, and here.

374
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:50,213
<i>- At the end could be the top of an R.
- There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler".</i>

375
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:52,881
Our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.

376
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:56,298
I don't know anybody else
that carried that.

377
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:58,472
Personal ads.

378
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,021
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecktor to reply to him

379
00:44:04,147 --> 00:44:07,018
<i>through the personal ads
section of the National Tattler.</i>

380
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,187
The Chicago office is down there
running through their ads.

381
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,532
We have cut into a line of communication
between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.

382
00:44:14,658 --> 00:44:19,367
If we find Lecktor's reply, we plan to
pull it, substitute it with one of our own.

383
00:44:19,496 --> 00:44:22,248
This is what
the Tooth Fairy will read. Bill?

384
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:26,324
"Dear Avid Fan. Inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements."

385
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:29,628
"Mementoes for you
at Baltimore Central, left luggage."

386
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:32,330
"Ticket number 72683."

387
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:36,595
It's a Secret Service letter drop. We'll
stake it out. When he shows, we grab him.

388
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:38,761
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.

389
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,808
- When do they go to press?
- 35 minutes.

390
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:43,974
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.

391
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:47,437
- There was no print.
- Scale counts and core size of the hair

392
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:49,973
matched the blond hair
found in the Jacobis'.

393
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,861
<i>That note was written by your man.</i>

394
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:56,856
Aside from the hair, three blue grains,
dark flecks - went to Brian's end.

395
00:44:56,991 --> 00:45:00,574
The grains are commercial cleanser,
with chlorine from the cleaner.

396
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,111
Particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

397
00:45:03,248 --> 00:45:05,121
<i>(phone rings)</i>

398
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:09,076
<i>- This is Chester. Who am I talking to?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.</i>

399
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:12,663
<i>I got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it
being telexed to you right now.</i>

400
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:15,337
<i>- Read it.
- "Dear Avid Fan, you honour me."</i>

401
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:17,508
<i>- "You're very beautiful."
- Oh, Christ.</i>

402
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:20,591
<i>"I offer 100 prayers for your safety."</i>

403
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:25,469
<i>"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,</i>

404
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:29,601
<i>Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,</i>

405
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:36,777
<i>Jonah 6:8, John 6:22, Luke 1:7. "</i>

406
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,945
<i>(Crawford) Thanks.</i>

407
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:48,163
Jimmy. Did you get anywhere
identifying him off the Leeds prints?

408
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,332
Not yet.

409
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:57,466
- Cryptography at Langley?
- They got shot a telex. They're on it now.

410
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:13,935
No. And our ad has to go out
in the same book code Lecktor used,

411
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:16,440
- or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor.
- Book code?

412
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,650
"100 prayers" could be page, the paired
numbers, line and letter. But what book?

413
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:23,070
<i>- The Bible?
- No. Galatians 15:2...</i>

414
00:46:23,201 --> 00:46:27,364
Galatians only has six chapters. Same
with Jonah 6:8. Jonah has four chapters.

415
00:46:27,497 --> 00:46:29,869
<i>Lecktor was not using The Bible.</i>

416
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:32,704
He probably named
the book in the part Lecktor tore out.

417
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:36,500
Right. What about sweatin' Lecktor?

418
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:40,213
They tried sodium amytal to find
where he buried a Princeton student.

419
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:44,043
- He gave 'em a recipe for potato-chip dip.
- Wonderful.

420
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,513
The Tooth Fairy would've named a book
he knew Lecktor has access to.

421
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:50,678
- He'd know from articles.
- When Willingham tossed the cell,

422
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,970
he took Polaroids
so he could put it all back.

423
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,596
Have him meet me
with pictures of Lecktor's books.

424
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:57,772
- Where?
- Library of Congress.

425
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,149
25 minutes. He won't make it in time.

426
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:11,825
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code

427
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:15,207
- and run our own ad next week.
- And lose a week? We got 17 days...

428
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:19,665
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running
without knowing what it says.

429
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:22,922
But it's your call, Will.

430
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,844
Run it.

431
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:31,840
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy
to do something else beside write?

432
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,053
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.

433
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,679
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?

434
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,312
<i>We bait him with something
in next week's Tattler.</i>

435
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,483
What, for instance?

436
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,571
Me.

437
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,781
I don't think that's a very good idea.

438
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:56,161
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?

439
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,700
Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked.

440
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:00,876
What I was thinkin' about is you.

441
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:05,590
You're gettin' deeper and deeper into this.

442
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,510
Sidney.

443
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:14,677
Last time you did that you did a real good
job of pushing yourself all out of shape.

444
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:19,603
You try it on again or you go through
some big trauma, you could relapse.

445
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,105
Sidney, don't worry about me.

446
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:25,604
I'm workin' the evidence.
Makin' moves. That's all.

447
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:28,612
I'm fine.

448
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,204
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.

449
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,833
- Price?
- He just heard it's a bust-out.

450
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:41,956
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us
a conviction, if we could find the guy.

451
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,586
But he must never have been printed,
because he is not in our index.

452
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:48,633
We are not going
to identify him off the print.

453
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:56,010
- I'll use Lounds.
- What for?

454
00:48:56,143 --> 00:49:01,433
<i>Boy doesn't read The New York Times.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.</i>

455
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,269
- What else shall we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he died.

456
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:14,321
I believe he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.

457
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,321
He's molested all of his male victims.

458
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,827
He may be impotent
with members of the opposite sex.

459
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:27,746
Our forensic psychologists have
projected, though I'm not sure,

460
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,002
that he may have had
sexual relations with his mother.

461
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,178
- How long will you stay in Washington?
- Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.

462
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,349
<i>- Can the Tattler get it straight from you?
- Absolutely.</i>

463
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,483
How does workin' on this case
affect your sex life?

464
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,944
Mine? It doesn't affect mine,
it affects yours. Go fuck yourself.

465
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,741
- Look, pal of mine, you're news.
- Pictures.

466
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,033
All right, let's shoot him.
I'm in the shots with Graham.

467
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,487
- What?
- I'm in the shots with you. Come on!

468
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,327
You want this to look real or not?

469
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,913
Make sure the theatre sign
across the street is just out of focus.

470
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,537
We want him to find it,
but we don't wanna be obvious.

471
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:13,623
Make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot.

472
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,714
One more. One more.

473
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,975
- That's enough.
- OK, Graham. Hey, always nice, huh?

474
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:24,767
Let's have lunch. Call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.

475
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:28,562
Dr Bloom. I need them
on my desk in two hours, OK?

476
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,615
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.

477
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,699
Tools and Firearms say
the cutting tool used on the branch

478
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,871
was a common bolt-cutter.

479
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,832
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?

480
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,251
- Yeah?
- It's a Chinese character,

481
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,623
considered a lucky sign in gambling.

482
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,713
The same character
appears on a mahjong piece.

483
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,515
It means "red dragon".
Mean anything to you?

484
00:51:03,017 --> 00:51:03,966
No.

485
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,555
If he shows, and he's smart,

486
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:13,984
he'll approach you from the front, pass,
turn, try and take you from behind.

487
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:16,151
- How's your hearing?
- It's good.

488
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,693
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.

489
00:51:20,826 --> 00:51:23,946
- You checked out a.44 Special Bulldog?
- Yeah.

490
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,246
- Load these in it.
- Glaser safety slugs.

491
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:31,372
Yeah. Number 12 shots suspended
in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.

492
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:34,204
On impact, it all opens up in the target.

493
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,673
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armour?

494
00:51:37,802 --> 00:51:41,052
- Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
- I hope you get one.

495
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,465
Cos he's gone for the head shot
eight out of 11 times?

496
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:48,058
Let's walk the route.

497
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:14,077
<i>United flight 849 to Newark

<i>United flight 849 to Newark

499
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:28,447
Someone's comin'.

500
00:53:58,606 --> 00:54:00,398
Go!

501
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:08,362
Don't! Don't move.

502
00:54:14,038 --> 00:54:16,660
- Take the money!
- Don't shoot!

503
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,831
- Don't shoot!
- Clear!

504
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,999
Clear!

505
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:31,387
What you movin' in slow motion for, man?
I'm bein' mugged!

506
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:34,262
<i>- (laughter)
- Can you believe that?</i>

507
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:40,260
<i>(radio) WAB Chicago.

508
00:54:41,315 --> 00:54:43,355
Hey!

509
00:55:23,732 --> 00:55:25,772
Do you know who I am?

510
00:55:25,901 --> 00:55:27,941
I don't wanna know who you are.

511
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:32,407
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.

512
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:34,572
An animal, you said.

513
00:55:37,996 --> 00:55:40,036
You know who I am now?

514
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:43,789
Yes.

515
00:55:44,836 --> 00:55:46,875
Do you feel privileged?

516
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:53,340
I'm very scared.

517
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,838
Open your eyes.

518
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,014
Mr Lounds, you're a reporter.

519
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:05,599
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.

520
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:10,274
If you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.

521
00:56:16,867 --> 00:56:21,114
Well? Here I... am.

522
00:56:38,138 --> 00:56:40,178
Look at the screen.

523
00:56:41,058 --> 00:56:43,383
<i>William Blake's The Great Red Dragon</i>

524

<i>and the Woman Clothed

- Do you see?
- Yes.

526
00:56:50,025 --> 00:56:53,441
- Mrs. Leeds. Do you see?
- Yes.

527
00:56:54,112 --> 00:56:58,442
- Mrs. Jacobi. Do you see?
- Yes.

528
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:04,569
The next family as they will look
when I go to visit them. Do you see?

529
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:06,746
Yes.

530
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:11,202
Mrs. Leeds, later. Her husband beside her.

531
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:14,587
Yes.

532
00:57:15,634 --> 00:57:18,338
Mrs. Jacobi, after her changing.

The Dragon rampant.

No.

- No what?
- No. Not me, please.

537
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,357
- Please.
- Are you a man?

538
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,613
Yes.

539
00:57:40,742 --> 00:57:43,114
Do you imply that I am queer?

540
00:57:43,244 --> 00:57:45,284
God, no!

541
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:49,206
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.

542
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:53,663
You are privy to a great... Becoming,
and you recognise nothing.

543
00:57:53,796 --> 00:57:55,836
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

544
00:57:56,758 --> 00:58:00,457
It is your nature
to do one thing correctly. Tremble.

545
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,464
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds.

546
00:58:04,598 --> 00:58:08,180
You and the others, you owe me awe!

547
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,813
We have one more piece of work to do.

548
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:23,072

01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:51,648
- What is it, Jack?
- The bastard gave him your address.

592
01:01:52,447 --> 01:01:56,860
It said "Graham home,
3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."

593
01:01:58,036 --> 01:02:00,657
- "Save yourself, kill them all."
- Get me a plane.

594
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:02,872
Will! Will.

595
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,084
Will.

596
01:02:06,586 --> 01:02:08,828
Mom.

597
01:02:09,422 --> 01:02:12,209
Huh? What... what?

598
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:15,509
Someone's outside. There are noises.

599
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:17,676
- Where?
- Outside.

600
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:34,690
Go back to your room and close the door.

601
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,740
Do it! Now!

602
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:30,417
- Ma'am? Are you all right?
- What? What is it?

603
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,167
What is it? What's going on?

604
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:38,790
- You should come back inside.
- What's going on?

605
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:40,586
- Come back inside.
- What's...

606
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,009
I think you should come back inside.

607
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:28,219
I'm sorry, Molly.

608
01:04:28,475 --> 01:04:30,515
I'm sorry about all of this.

609
01:04:34,148 --> 01:04:36,354
This place is fine. We'll be fine.

610
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:42,187
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- It's just a precaution.

611
01:04:43,532 --> 01:04:47,399
Kevin, why don't you run down
to the water, check out the dock?

612
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:50,407
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.

613
01:04:50,539 --> 01:04:52,578
OK.

614
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,000
What is that about?

615
01:04:58,297 --> 01:05:01,380
What, he's afraid
to leave you alone with me now?

616
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:05,549
<i>- He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
- I wanted to talk with him,</i>

617
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:09,213
but he said he wanted
to bring it up to you, face to face.

618
01:05:09,348 --> 01:05:13,013
Good for him. Kevin, come on.
Help me unpack, will you?

619
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:15,635
Then we'll go get some groceries.

620
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:31,034
You and Mom are very well protected.
No one's gonna find out where you are.

621
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:34,780
Is there anything I need to know?
To see about Mom?

622
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:37,869
- No.
- This guy's trying to kill us?

623
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:42,747
- We don't know that.
- When are you going to kill him?

624
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,464
I'm not. It's only my job to find him.

625
01:05:55,561 --> 01:06:00,104
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.

626
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:05,606
Well, it was a regular hospital.

627
01:06:05,737 --> 01:06:08,941
Then I was transferred
into the psychiatric wing.

628
01:06:10,158 --> 01:06:13,325
That bothers you, doesn't it?

629
01:06:13,453 --> 01:06:15,695
I don't know.

630
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:19,663
Was it because... in the papers
it said it was this man Lecktor?

631
01:06:19,793 --> 01:06:22,284
- Mm-hm.
- What happened?

632
01:06:24,506 --> 01:06:28,586
Well, Lecktor was attacking
college girls, and he killed them.

633
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:31,254
How?

634
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,929
In bad ways.

635
01:06:36,935 --> 01:06:39,307
He was a psychiatrist.

636
01:06:39,437 --> 01:06:43,601
One of the girls was his patient,
and I went to talk to him about her.

637
01:06:46,194 --> 01:06:50,274
I tried to build feelings
in my imagination like the killer had,

638
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,898
so that I would know
why he did what he did,

639
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:56,118
because that would help me find him.

640
01:06:56,246 --> 01:07:01,536
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office,
and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.

641
01:07:01,668 --> 01:07:04,538
It had pictures of war wounds in it.

642
01:07:04,671 --> 01:07:06,710
Then I knew it was him.

643
01:07:08,216 --> 01:07:11,667
So I went to a payphone
down the hall to call the police.

644
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,635
And that's when he attacked me.

645
01:07:19,477 --> 01:07:25,514
You and Mom came to see me
in the hospital, and that helped a lot.

646
01:07:25,649 --> 01:07:31,817
But after my body got OK, I still had
his thoughts going around in my head.

647
01:07:34,658 --> 01:07:36,697
And I stopped talking to people.

648
01:07:39,204 --> 01:07:43,747
And a doctor friend of mine,
a Dr Bloom, asked me to get some help.

649
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,915
And I did.

650
01:07:46,044 --> 01:07:49,247
And after a while, I felt better,
and I was OK again.

651
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,880
And the way he thought felt that bad?

652
01:07:57,931 --> 01:08:01,430
Kevin, they're
the ugliest thoughts in the world.

653
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:21,316
So what kind of coffee do you like?

654
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:25,873
- Huh?
- You like that Folgers stuff, right?

655
01:08:27,293 --> 01:08:28,372
Yeah.

656
01:08:29,462 --> 01:08:31,501
Mom likes that too.

657
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:37,501
When can we go home, Dad?

658
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:41,964
I don't know, Kevin.

659
01:08:56,822 --> 01:09:00,440
<i>- (Molly) So where are things?
- (Graham) Nowhere.</i>

660
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:07,114
Everything we've tried
is either a dead end or it's backfired.

661
01:09:07,249 --> 01:09:11,876
Crawford's already planning the next
crime scene so we can get it fresh.

662
01:09:13,756 --> 01:09:17,255
We got about six more days
till the next full moon.

663
01:09:17,384 --> 01:09:19,756
Can you quit?

664
01:09:19,887 --> 01:09:22,129
No.

665
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:27,384
What's next?

666
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:31,476
- I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?

667
01:09:32,524 --> 01:09:34,564
No.

668
01:09:37,362 --> 01:09:39,438
I have to be... alone.

669
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:49,118
- It's exactly what you said you wouldn't...
- This killing. It's got to stop.

670
01:10:17,943 --> 01:10:22,272
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.

671
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,913
You and Kevin should go to Montana.

672
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:38,288
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.

673
01:10:40,507 --> 01:10:43,425
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.

674
01:11:12,247 --> 01:11:16,576
<i>Hi. This is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

675
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:21,460
- I'm sorry, too.
- Excuse me?

676
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:25,005
Coffee.

677
01:11:34,227 --> 01:11:36,266
Just you and me now, sport.

678
01:11:38,606 --> 01:11:40,646
I'm gonna find you, goddamn it.

679
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:03,416
- Mr Dollarhyde.
- Ah, Eileen.

680
01:12:03,547 --> 01:12:07,840
Bill told me to tell you there was
a variation in the gamma of number three.

681
01:12:07,968 --> 01:12:10,007
- Oh.
- But he caught it in time.

682
01:12:14,307 --> 01:12:16,929
Eileen...

683
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:19,099
Good. Good.

684
01:13:13,282 --> 01:13:14,990
<i>- (knock)
- (woman) Who's there?</i>

685
01:13:15,117 --> 01:13:18,866
Mr Dollarhyde. I came about
the low-light infrared emulsion.

686
01:13:18,996 --> 01:13:21,119
Oh, yeah. Come on in. It's safe.

687
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,041
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.

688
01:13:33,177 --> 01:13:35,929
You're the production controller, right?

689
01:13:37,056 --> 01:13:39,428
Can you give me
an idea of the conditions?

690
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:42,761
I'm shooting from maybe eight feet.

691
01:13:42,895 --> 01:13:46,893
- I... I can't use any lights.
- OK. What's being photographed?

692
01:13:47,816 --> 01:13:52,194
- The activities of nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?

693
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:55,441
- Four days.
- OK. Let me stick these in a black bag.

694
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:05,120
1000C infrared sensitive
has to be handled in total darkness.

695
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:10,375
Remember to be very careful with it, but
it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.

696
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:11,964
It'll be fine.

697
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:15,756
In case you're wondering, I keep
the samples straight by touch code.

698
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:17,925
I... I wasn't wondering.

699
01:14:19,139 --> 01:14:22,222
Reba, I gotta fly. Maybe
Mr Dollarhyde can drive you home?

700
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:26,394
No, that's OK.
I'll take care of myself. No, thanks.

701
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,560
OK.

702
01:14:32,151 --> 01:14:34,476
- I'll... take you.
- No, thanks.

703
01:14:34,612 --> 01:14:38,277
I'll order you 1200 feet
of 1000C in the morning.

704
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,325
- Ride with me.
- Thanks, but I'll take the bus.

705
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:46,698
Ride with me. It would be
because I would like you to.

706
01:14:49,043 --> 01:14:51,082
OK. Sure. Let me get my stuff on.

707
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,962
How did you come to Gateway?

708
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:59,626
They had to hire the handicapped
to shape up their employment practices

709
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,801
to get this defence contract.

710
01:15:02,514 --> 01:15:06,215
- But you worked out well.
- Yeah. Everybody they hired did.

711
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:11,979
You know, you speak very well, although
you avoid fricatives and sibilants.

712
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:14,563
At the Institute for the Blind
I trained in therapy

713
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:18,109
for speech-
and hearing-impaired children.

714
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:20,480
I'll probably go back to it someday.

715
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,941
Uh-huh.

716
01:15:23,076 --> 01:15:25,828
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
But I hope you will,

717
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:31,328
because you're very direct, and I like that,
and I like what you have to say.

718
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,666
May I touch your face?

719
01:15:34,713 --> 01:15:37,251
I wanna know whether
you're smiling or frowning.

720
01:15:37,382 --> 01:15:41,166
I guess I wanna know
whether I should be quiet or not.

721
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:50,852
Take my word for it. I'm smiling.

722
01:15:51,271 --> 01:15:53,310
I... I didn't mean to offend you.

723
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,317
- On the way, can I take you somewhere?
- Where?

724
01:15:59,612 --> 01:16:04,488
- It would be my surprise.
- OK, sure.

725
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:23,505
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.

726
01:16:23,636 --> 01:16:26,507
You're very protected.
Mr Dollarhyde is watching us.

727
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:28,964
No, no. I want to.

728
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,967
In about two hours,
we're going to cap his tooth.

729
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:33,318
<i>(Reba) Yeah.</i>

730
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:35,494
<i>(vet) It's warm?</i>

731
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:52,008
Back a little bit. There.

732
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:53,799
<i>(heartbeat)</i>

733
01:17:53,933 --> 01:17:56,305
- You hear it?
- Yes.

734
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:28,706
You... rearrange the dead families
into an audience to see what you do.

735
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:35,223
You think that what you do
will make you into something different.

736
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:37,388
You are "Becoming".

737
01:18:39,144 --> 01:18:41,516
What is it you think you're becoming?

738
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:47,777
The answer's
in the way you use the mirrors.

739
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:56,159
What do the mirrors
make you dream you're becoming?

740
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,108
A little to your left.

741
01:19:39,578 --> 01:19:42,614
Francis, that was
a great dinner. Thank you.

742

And why shouldn't it feel good?

01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:23,113
<i>It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.</i>

819
01:27:24,326 --> 01:27:28,787
God's terrific. He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

820
01:27:28,914 --> 01:27:33,623
last Wednesday in Texas, as they were
grovelling through a hymn to his majesty.

<i>Don't you think that felt good?</i>

822
01:27:40,301 --> 01:27:42,377
Why does it feel good, Dr Lecktor?

823
01:27:43,512 --> 01:27:48,008
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.

824
01:27:48,142 --> 01:27:51,142
And if one does
what God does enough times,

825
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,937
<i>one will become as God is.</i>

"If one does what God does enough
times, one will become as God is."

You put it together, you get...

If our boy imitates being
wanted and desired enough times,

Are you sympathising with this guy now?

Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.

896
01:33:47,828 --> 01:33:50,366
Someone took a kid,
and manufactured a monster.

897

At the same time,
as an adult, he's irredeemable.

898
01:33:54,376 --> 01:33:57,293
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.

899
01:33:57,421 --> 01:34:01,252
As an adult, someone should blow
the sick fuck out of his socks.

900
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:09,008
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?

901
01:34:10,141 --> 01:34:13,842
Does this kind of understanding
make you uncomfortable?

902
01:34:26,282 --> 01:34:29,070
What about the mirrors?

903
01:34:30,578 --> 01:34:33,152
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.

904
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:40,412
But he doesn't take anything. There's
no souvenirs taken from the houses.

905
01:34:40,547 --> 01:34:43,832
He needs souvenirs
or trophies to relive the event.

906
01:34:48,221 --> 01:34:50,260
Maybe he records it somehow.

907
01:34:51,516 --> 01:34:55,513
So he could see himself accepted,
over and over and over again.

908
01:34:58,648 --> 01:35:01,221
VTRs? Polaroids? Stills? What?

909
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:03,398
How do I know?

910
01:35:05,446 --> 01:35:07,486
How does he find 'em?

911
01:35:08,533 --> 01:35:10,858
We find out
how he found them, we'll find him.

912
01:35:10,993 --> 01:35:13,531
There is no connection
between the two families.

913
01:35:13,663 --> 01:35:17,612
- We've done a dozen computer runs.
- All the women have a bloom on them.

914
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,205
He didn't win them in a lottery.
He picked them.

915
01:35:20,335 --> 01:35:22,660
There's selection
and design in his choices.

916
01:35:22,796 --> 01:35:25,465
Look. Admit we struck out this month.

917
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:28,342
The Learjet is standing by.
The basic lab stuff is on it.

918
01:35:28,468 --> 01:35:30,876
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price,
the photographer.

919
01:35:31,012 --> 01:35:34,713
Anywhere he hits, we can be there
in an hour. We get the call, we roll.

920
01:35:34,849 --> 01:35:37,305
- The scene'll be fresh.
- It's not over yet.

921
01:35:37,435 --> 01:35:40,187
Oh, for Christ's sake.
It's a foregone conclusion.

922
01:35:40,313 --> 01:35:43,729
It's 11.30pm.
The full moon is happening tonight.

923
01:35:43,858 --> 01:35:46,147
Give it up!
Forget this month. It's too late.

924
01:35:46,277 --> 01:35:50,026
<i>I gave it up. Till you showed up
with pictures of two dead families,</i>

925
01:35:50,156 --> 01:35:53,607
knowing damn well that I'd imagine
families three, four, five and six.

926
01:35:53,743 --> 01:35:57,741
- You're fuckin' right! I'd do it again!
- Great! But don't talk to me about late!

927
01:35:57,872 --> 01:36:03,246
I'll tell you when it's too fuckin' late! Until
then, we go as late as I wanna take it!

928
01:36:21,395 --> 01:36:23,803
A padlock.

929
01:36:29,236 --> 01:36:32,736
- That's why the bolt-cutter.
- What's that?

930
01:36:32,865 --> 01:36:36,565
He used a bolt-cutter to trim the branch
when he watched from the woods.

931
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:38,742
Why didn't he use it on the garage door?

932
01:36:38,871 --> 01:36:42,156
Because a deadbolt
was there when they were killed.

933
01:36:45,753 --> 01:36:49,501
Donald Jacobi's
12th birthday party was April 14th.

934
01:36:49,632 --> 01:36:52,965
Some time between April 14th
and August 1, they changed the lock.

935
01:36:53,093 --> 01:36:55,667
But he thought there was a padlock there.

936
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:06,856
From the street, you can't see
the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.

937
01:37:06,982 --> 01:37:11,644
There's a big high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass-cutter.

938
01:37:13,322 --> 01:37:19,656
So either he was casing far ahead,
and we didn't check back far enough,

939
01:37:22,205 --> 01:37:24,245
or...

940
01:37:26,043 --> 01:37:28,082
We checked.

941
01:37:31,798 --> 01:37:36,341
Metcalf, it's Graham. Is the Leeds
and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?

942
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:39,802
Have the guard down there call me. Do it.

943
01:37:48,188 --> 01:37:50,311
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.

944
01:37:53,444 --> 01:37:57,441
You brought a bolt-cutter cos
you thought there was a padlock.

945
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:03,946
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar
but you know it's theirs, don't you?

946
01:38:06,457 --> 01:38:10,240
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?

947
01:38:12,754 --> 01:38:15,874
You can see her again and again,
any time you want.

948
01:38:17,217 --> 01:38:21,511
Doggy doesn't have a collar,
but you know it's the Leeds' dog.

949
01:38:21,638 --> 01:38:23,678
And the Jacobi cat.

950
01:38:24,725 --> 01:38:26,764
And the padlock on the door.

951
01:38:29,521 --> 01:38:33,768
And you know you need a bolt-cutter
and every other goddamn thing.

952
01:38:34,734 --> 01:38:38,103
Cos everything with you
is seeing, isn't it?

953
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:45,287
Your primary sensory intake
that makes your dream live is seeing.

954
01:38:46,746 --> 01:38:51,954
Reflections. Mirrors. Images.

955
01:39:01,803 --> 01:39:03,842
You've seen these films.

956
01:39:09,185 --> 01:39:11,225
Haven't you, my man?

957
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:19,643
<i>- (phone rings)
- It's the guard in the storeroom.</i>

958
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:21,606
- The cans.
- What cans?

959
01:39:21,739 --> 01:39:24,942
The tapes were from home movies.
Where's the films' packaging?

960
01:39:25,076 --> 01:39:29,323
There's films of the families
in the document storage. Find 'em.

961
01:39:31,457 --> 01:39:34,031
You got 'em? Are there any labels?

962
01:39:37,463 --> 01:39:40,037
Leeds can, Gateway Lab,
St Louis, Missouri.

963
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:43,092
The Jacobi label will say
the same thing as the Leeds label.

964
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:45,377
Gateway Lab, St Louis, Missouri.

965
01:39:45,513 --> 01:39:47,552
Who processed the Jacobi film?

966
01:39:50,518 --> 01:39:53,472
No. Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.

967
01:39:53,604 --> 01:39:57,103
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.

968
01:39:57,233 --> 01:39:59,271
Is there a label underneath?

969
01:40:11,871 --> 01:40:14,327
It does, doesn't it?

970
01:40:20,964 --> 01:40:24,048
I want a chopper on the roof
in three minutes to Meigs Field.

971
01:40:24,175 --> 01:40:28,636
At Meigs Field, I want the Learjet
prepped and a plan filed to St Louis.

972
