1
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:52,437
We should've talked at the boatyard.

2
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,814
You don't wanna talk about it here.

3
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,568
I'm not falling all over myself to
talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.

4
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,445
How much do you know?

5
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:03,364
Not much.

6
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,455
The Birmingham one was in
the papers over a month ago.

7
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,626
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

8
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:17,502
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?

9
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:20,047
- No.
- Why not?

10
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,842
I quit. Remember?

11
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,473
You look all right now.

12
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:33,393
I am all right.

13
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:49,117
If you can't look
anymore, I understand.

14
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:51,954
Don't try to run
a game down on me, Jack.

15
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:02,047
If I really didn't need you
to come back, I wouldn't ask.

16
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,424
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

17
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:07,094
I have three weeks and a few
days until the next full moon.

18
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:12,642
We have a better chance
to get him fast if you help.

19
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,562
I'll think about it.

20
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,648
Stay and eat.

21
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:12,410
Hi, Molly.

22
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,675
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.

23
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,554
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?

24
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,722
In this hatchery?

25
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,266
I'll bet there's
40 or 50 of them.

26
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:39,311
Crabs get most
of the newborns, huh?

27
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,146
Yeah, but not now.

28
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,275
These are all gonna
make it, guaranteed.

29
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:48,737
What about the dogs?

30
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,906
- Are they gonna get in here?
- They can't dig under.

31
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:54,076
That's why we bury
the wire down in the sand.

32
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,664
We need more staples, pal.

33
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,299
You're supposed
to be his friend, Jack.

34
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,677
Why didn't you leave him alone?

35
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,349
If he decides to do it, Molly,

36
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,102
I'll keep him as far
away from it as I can.

37
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,827
We got it pretty good, don't we?

38
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,539
We have it more than good.

39
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:43,793
All that happened to you
before lets you know that.

40
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:51,424
If I went back,
I'd only look at evidence.

41
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,761
I wouldn't get deeply involved.

42
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,014
He'd never even
see me or know my name.

43
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,060
If they find him,
they'll have to take him down, not me.

44
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:06,607
What do you think?

45
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,864
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.

46
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,828
If I were asking?

47
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:25,584
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.

48
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,546
But it's selfish, and I know it.

49
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:36,137
Come here.

50
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:37,865
OFFICER: I'll come inside with you,
if you want, to show you around.

51
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,710
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but...

52
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,380
That's right.

53
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:58,010
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.

54
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,931
They transferred some home movies
of both families onto half-inch VHS.

55
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,016
Thanks.

56
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:50,080
Intruder entered through
kitchen sliding door.

57
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,874
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

58
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,543
His entry was skillful.

59
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,089
All the prints
are smooth gloves.

60
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:04,256
Blond hair, strong,
size 12 shoe imprint.

61
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:09,642
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva
on glass from licking the suction cup.

62
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,312
Why didn't he care that
he left saliva on the glass?

63
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,901
It was hot out that night,

64
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:23,197
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

65
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,745
Intruder cut Charles Leeds'
throat as he was rising,

66
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,913
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

67
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,416
Bullet entered right of her navel
and lodged in her lumbar spine,

68
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,502
but she died of strangulation.

69
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,671
Moderate elevation of
serotonin and marked increase

70
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,132
of free histamine level
in gunshot wound

71
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,718
indicates she lived at least
five minutes after she was shot.

72
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,097
All her other injuries
were post-mortem.

73
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:52,643
Direction and velocity of bloodstains
on east wall indicate arterial spray.

74
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,396
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight

75
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:59,066
because the intruder was
moving to the children's room.

76
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,320
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom

77
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,117
and matted sliding marks on
hall carpet remain unexplained,

78
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,621
as does superficial ligature
mark around Mr. Leeds' chest,

79
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:16,125
also believed to be post-mortem.

80
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,590
What did the killer do with
them after they were dead?

81

VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.

83
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,707
Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now,

84
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,627
but if you'd like to leave a
message please do so after the beep,

85
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:02,670
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

(DIAL TONE SOUNDING)

88
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,118
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem,
four or five minutes later.

89
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:37,205
What did he do in the interval?

91
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:44,671

94
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,093
- Hello?
- WILL: Molly?

95
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,930
- MOLLY: Will, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, honey.

96
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:40,102
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.

97
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,937
I love you.

98
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,232
I love you too, baby.

99
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:33,864
What are you dreaming?

100
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,996
That's something you can't afford
for me to know about, isn't it?

101
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,878
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

102
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:56,428
It was maddening to have to touch
her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?

103
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:00,098
They found talcum
powder on her leg,

104
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,602
but there wasn't any talcum
powder in the bathroom.

105
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,857
The talcum powder came
out of a rubber glove

106
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:12,152
as you pulled
it off to touch her.

107
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:17,157
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?

108
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,076
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

109
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:21,786
You touched her
with your bare hands,

110
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,997
and then you put
your gloves back on.

111
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,125
But while your gloves were off,

112
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,420
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see you?

113
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:44,934
JACK: Hello?

114
00:15:44,935 --> 00:15:47,437
Jack, this is Graham.

115
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,439
Is Price still in Latent Prints?

116
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:53,359
Yeah, he's in charge
of the Single Print Index now.

117
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,861
What do you got, Will?

118
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:56,028
Get him to Atlanta.

119
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,738
Atlanta PD swears
they dusted everything,

120
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,031
and their guy is pretty good.

121
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,658
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.

122
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,452
I'll get him on a plane
in the morning.

123
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,830
What do you want him to do?

124
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,878
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails
and the corneas of all their eyes.

125
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:15,465
I think he took off his gloves.

126
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,470
Our people swear he wore
surgeon's gloves the whole time.

127
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,556
They dusted everything.

128
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,434
Your report didn't mention eyes.

129
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:29,103
Why do you think
he took his gloves off?

130
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,481
WILL: Because Mrs. Leeds
was a beautiful woman.

131
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:51,001
All right, all right.
Settle down, now.

132
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,296
Sit down, please.

133
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:58,257
After-house interviews Will be
extended an additional four blocks.

134
00:16:58,258 --> 00:16:59,842
RNI's loaned us a couple of clerks

135
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:01,511
to cross-match
the airline reservations

136
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:05,014
between Birmingham last month
and Atlanta now.

137
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,683
Dr. Princi.

138
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,604
This is what the subject's
teeth looked like.

139
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:14,149
The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these

140
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,275
from the impressions that
we took of the bite marks

141
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,443
on the Leeds woman here

142
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:21,448
and the Jacobi woman
in Birmingham last month.

143
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:25,826
As you can see, he has
pegged lateral incisors,

144
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:29,122
that's these teeth
here and here.

145
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,042
All right.

146
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:36,087
Investigator Graham, you've worked
this kind of thing before.

147
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,923
Can you add anything?

148
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,969
Could you come up to the front?

149
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,609
I don't think he's a drifter,
acting upon victims of opportunity.

150
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,946
Skillful entry indicates
premeditation and planning.

151
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,907
Therefore, I believe
he's an organized individual

152
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:09,079
who probably lives life competently
with little or no leakage.

153
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,666
Meaning in appearance
he could be absolutely anyone?

154
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,043
That's right.

155
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,255
Bodies being arranged
into an audience and the mirrors

156
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:21,424
make me believe that there's a rich
and intense fantasy life

157
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:22,550
going on here.

158
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,303

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,333
So many experts
on government grants.

And you say, you're a layman?

But it was you who caught me,
wasn't it, Will?

317
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,759
- Do you know how you did it?
- What does it matter now?

318
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,513
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

319
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:50,682
I want you to help me,
Dr. Lecter.

320
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:52,893
Yes, I thought so.

321
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:54,812
It's about Atlanta
and Birmingham.

322
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,021
Yes?

323
00:26:56,022 --> 00:26:58,441
- You read about it?
- In the papers.

324
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,819
I don't tear out the articles.

325
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:04,572
I wouldn't want them to think I
was dwelling on anything morbid.

326
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,619
You want to know how he's choosing
them, don't you?

327
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,704
- I thought you might have some ideas.
- Why should I tell you?

328
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:15,082
You'd get to see
the file on this case.

329
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,543
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.

330
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:19,169
Thought you might
be curious to see

331
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,671
if you're smarter than the
person I'm looking for.

332
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,632
Then by implication you think you're
smarter than me, since you caught me.

333
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,385
No. I know that
I'm not smarter than you.

334
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:28,804
- Then how did you catch me?
- You had disadvantages.

335
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,055
What disadvantages?

336
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:32,183
You're insane.

00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:36,187
You are very tan, Will.

338
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,482
Your hands are rough.

339
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,402
They don't look like
cop's hands anymore.

340
00:27:43,403 --> 00:27:45,988
And that shaving lotion is
something a child would select.

341
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:48,741
It has a ship on the
bottle, doesn't it?

342
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,538
Don't think you can persuade me with
appeals to my intellectual vanity.

343
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,833
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.

344
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,961
You'll either
do it or you won't.

What were their yards like?

00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:37,975
Big back yards. Fences, hedges.
Why?

359
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,018
Because, my dear Will,

360
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,272
if this pilgrim imagines he has
a relationship with the moon,

361

he might go outside
to look at it.

Have you ever seen
blood in the moonlight?

It appears quite black.

364

If one were nude, it would be better
to have privacy for this sort of thing.

That's interesting.

468
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,876
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.

469
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:32,587
Listen, have you seen
this week's Tattler?

470
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:34,965
It's not on my preferred reading list,
Jack.

471
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:35,115
(SCOFFS) It's not on my
preferred reading list.

472
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,718
Yeah, well, uh, your picture's
all over the front page.

473
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:41,972
Who the hell was it? Lounds?

474
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,473
Of course. Who else?

475
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,433
God damn it, Jack!

476
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:49,104
I promised Molly!
I promised her!

477
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:51,606
Come in.

478
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:54,734
- GUARD: Dr. Chilton?
- Yes?

479
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,861
When we were cleaning
out Dr. Lecter's cell,

480
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,780
he heard us coming and
hid something in a book.

481
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,490
We got him out of
there and dug around.

482
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,908
-Is that it?
-Yes.

483
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:03,952
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.

484
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:13,962
Has anyone else
seen this except you?

485
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:15,631
No.

486
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:20,677
SECRETARY: Special Agent
Crawford's office.

487
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,680
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.

488
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,973
He's not here,
he's in Birmingham.

489
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,392
Special Agent Crawford
is on the line with him now.

490
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:29,478
Please tell them
this is very, very urgent.

491
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:31,355
I'll hold on.

492
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:35,650
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.

493
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,318
You have Will Graham
on the line, too.

494
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:40,405
CHILTON: I have a note,
or two pieces of a note

495
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:43,199
that appears to be from that man
who killed those people in Atlanta.

496
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,035
Dr. Chilton, where did you get it?

497
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,662
In Hannibal Lecter's cell.
It was hidden in a book.

498
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:50,748
WILL: Dr. Chilton, don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?

499
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:53,543
It's written on toilet tissue.

500
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,526
"My dear Dr. Lecter,
"I wanted to tell you I'm

501
00:41:56,551 --> 00:41:59,532
delighted that you've
taken an interest in me.

502
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,970
"I know that you alone can
understand what I am becoming.

503
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:08,266
"You alone know the people I
use to help me in these things

504
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:11,102
"are only elements
undergoing change

505
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:15,064
"to fuel the radiance
of what I am becoming,

506
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,068
"just as the source
of light is burning.

507
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,447
"I have a collection
of your press clippings.

508
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:25,408
"I think they are absurd,
as are mine.

509
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,579
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what
could be more inappropriate?

510
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,373
"Investigator Graham
interests me,

511
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:34,500
"very purposeful-looking.

512
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:37,045
"I hope we can correspond."

513
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:38,838
Mr. Graham,
there's a piece missing here.

514
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,507
Now I'll read the bottom part.

515
00:42:41,216 --> 00:42:43,092
"After I hear back from you,

516
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,303
"I might send
you something wet."

517
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:47,723
Signed "Avid Fan."

518
00:42:48,307 --> 00:42:50,850
It has teeth marks pressed
into it at the bottom.

519
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:53,978
Sarah, order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.

520
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,480
Two, call Alabama
Air National Guard,

521
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:57,398
and tell 'em to get Graham
back here right now.

522
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:59,567
Then call Documents and tell
them to scramble a team.

523
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,737
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?

524
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:05,531
JACK: I have a Documents team on its way
to you by helicopter to pick up the note.

525
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:06,657
Listen, after we've
worked the note,

526
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:08,118
I want to replace
it in Lecter's cell.

527
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,119
I don't want Lecter to know
that we've found it,

528
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,829
he might try to warn
the killer somehow.

529
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,082
- Where's Lecter now?
- CHILTON: Holding cell.

530
00:43:14,249 --> 00:43:16,626
How long can you keep him in there
without him getting suspicious?

531
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,503
CHILTON: Three, four hours.

532
00:43:18,504 --> 00:43:20,630
Brian, we have a note
coming in on the flight,

533
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,133
possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.

534
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,052
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.

535
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:28,095
Will Graham and I
will be walking it through.

536
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:11,097
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.

537
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:14,809
- And a couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.

538
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,978
What do we have
for negative comparison?

539
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:21,149
Hair from Lecter's comb, whiskers
from Lecter's razor they let him use.

540
00:44:21,316 --> 00:44:24,528
This is hair from
the security guard.

541
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,800
MAN: How many guys
handled this without gloves?

542
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:49,344
The guard, cleanup man, Lecter.

543
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:51,596
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks

544
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:54,974
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

545
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:58,896
But the others... One smudge.

546
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,193
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.

547
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,361
I can fume for a print,

548
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:09,447
but can't guarantee the
iodine stains would fade out.

549
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:11,824
- Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat?
- No.

550
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:14,201
We couldn't wash it after.

551
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:17,581
I can't get a print off this in the
time you've got to get it back, Will.

552
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,291
- BOWMAN: How long do I have?
- JACK: Twenty minutes, max.

553
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:21,751
BOWMAN: The main thing
to find out is,

554
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,170
how was Lecter supposed
to reply to him?

555
00:45:24,171 --> 00:45:27,453
Which is probably the missing
section, because at the top it says,

556
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:31,011
"I hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.

557
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:35,841
This note was written in
ballpoint, but it looks like

558
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,976
Lecter went over this
area with a felt-tip pen,

559
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:41,104
then tore it away.

560
00:46:09,508 --> 00:46:14,596
You're so sly, but so am I.

561
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:24,822
The aniline dyes used in
the ink of the felt-tip

562
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:28,067
pens like Lecter used are
transparent to infrared.

563
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:31,738
The Tooth Fairy's
ballpoint isn't.

564
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,290
This looks like the tip
of a T here, here, and here.

565
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:45,626
At the end is what
could be the top of an R.

566
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:47,712
There's three Ts
and an R in "Tattler."

567
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:50,339
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecter.

568
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,759
I don't know anybody else
that's carried that.

569
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:55,512
Personal ads.

570
00:46:58,473 --> 00:47:01,101
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecter to reply to him

571
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:04,186
through the personal ad section
of the National Tattler.

572
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:07,356
The Chicago office is down there
right now running through their ads.

573
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,650
We have cut into
a line of communication

574
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:11,778
between the Tooth Fairy
and Lecter.

575
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:14,655
If we find Lecter's
reply we plan to pull it,

576
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:16,574
substitute it
with one of our own.

577
00:47:16,575 --> 00:47:19,535
And this is what the Tooth
Fairy Will read. Bill?

578
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:23,581
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.

579
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:26,959
"Mementos for you at Baltimore
Central Left Luggage.

580
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,670
"Ticket number 72683."

581
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:33,049
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.

582
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,162
When he shows, we'll grab him.

583
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:35,792
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH: Not yet.

584
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:38,012
When do they go to press?

585
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:39,347
JACK: Thirty-five minutes.

586
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,099
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.

587
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:43,100
There was no print.

588
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:44,935
Scale counts
and core size of the hair

589
00:47:44,936 --> 00:47:47,396
match the blond hair
found in the Jacobis'.

590
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,316
That note was written
by your man.

591
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:54,278
Aside from the hair, three blue grains,
dark flecks, went to Brian's end.

592
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,906
The grains are commercial
granulated cleanser with chlorine,

593
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:57,990
from the cleaning man.

594
00:47:57,991 --> 00:48:00,202
Several particles of dried
blood, but not enough to type.

595
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:01,282
(PHONE RINGING)

596
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,663
OVER PHONE: This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?

597
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,041
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

598
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:10,086
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in
it being telexed to you right now.

599
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,921
Read it. "Dear Avid Fan,

600
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,839
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."

601
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,007
JACK: Oh, Christ.

602
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:17,802
"I offer 100 prayers
for your safety.

603
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:22,803
"Find help in Galatians
6: 11, 15:2,

604
00:48:22,808 --> 00:48:27,437
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,

605
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:33,984
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."

606
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,569
JACK: Thanks.

607
00:48:41,827 --> 00:48:45,371
Jimmy. Did you get anywhere at all
identifying him off the Leeds' prints?

608
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:46,581
Not yet.

609
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:51,461
Photography at Langley?

610
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,464
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.

611
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:11,397
No. And our ad has to go out in
the same book code Lecter used,

612
00:49:11,398 --> 00:49:13,274
or he'll know it wasn't
Lecter talking to him.

613
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:14,316
Book code?

614
00:49:14,317 --> 00:49:16,939
"100 prayers" could be the page
number, the paired numbers could

615
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:18,375
be line and letter.
But what book?

616
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,326
-JACK: Not the Bible?
-No.

617
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:22,074
Galatians 15:2. Galatians only has
six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8.

618
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:24,743
Jonah only has four chapters.

619
00:49:24,744 --> 00:49:27,329
Lecter was not using the Bible.

620
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,166
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named
the book in the part Lecter tore out.

621
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,168
Right.

622
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,919
What about sweating Lecter?

623
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,750
They tried sodium amytal
on him three years ago

624
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:37,489
to find where he buried
a Princeton student.

625
00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:39,258
He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.

626
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:41,343
JACK: Wonderful.

627
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:44,972
The Tooth Fairy would have named a
book he knew Lecter has access to.

628
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:46,891
He'd know it from articles
he'd read about Lecter.

629
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:48,142
JACK: Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,

630
00:49:48,143 --> 00:49:50,269
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.

631
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:53,147
Have him meet me with
pictures of Lecter's books.

632
00:49:53,148 --> 00:49:55,483
JACK: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.

633
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:03,491
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.

634
00:50:04,618 --> 00:50:06,494
Lecter's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.

635
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,456
Or we pull it, figure out the
code and run our own ad next week.

636
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:12,875
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.

637
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,379
And I don't like Lecter's ad
running without knowing what it says.

638
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,800
It's your call, Will.

639
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:25,095
Run it.

640
00:50:25,096 --> 00:50:29,225
And what if it encourages the Tooth
Fairy to do something else beside write?

641
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,518
We'll all feel sick
for a very long time.

642
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:34,105
JACK: And if Bowman
still can't figure it out?

643
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,525
Then we'll bait him with something
else in next week's Tattler.

644
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,736
JACK: What, for instance?

645
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,406
Me.

646
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:47,077
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

647
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,499
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?

648
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,960
Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked.

649
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:58,380
What I was thinking
about is you.

650
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:01,548
You're getting deeper
and deeper into this.

651
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:02,967
Good night.

652
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:03,926
Sidney.

653
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,929
I'll talk to you.

654
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:11,976
Last time you did that you did a real good
job of pushing yourself all out of shape.

655
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:14,895
You try it on again or you
go through some big trauma,

656
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:16,981
you could relapse, my friend.

657
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:19,483
Sidney, don't worry about me.

658
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:23,654
I'm working the evidence,
making moves. That's all.

659
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:25,573
I'm fine.

660
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:29,577
Bowman just struck out.

661
00:51:29,744 --> 00:51:33,122
- It is not books in Lecter's cell.
- Price?

662
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,124
He just heard. It's a bust-out.

663
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,502
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction

664
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:39,378
if we could ever find the guy.

665
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:43,007
But he must never have been printed
because he is not in our index.

666
00:51:43,008 --> 00:51:45,760
We are not gonna
identify him off the print.

667
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,932
I'll use Lounds.

668
00:51:51,558 --> 00:51:53,392
What for?

669
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:55,894
Our boy doesn't read the New
York Times literary supplement.

670
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:58,732
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.

671
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:04,778
What else should we cover?

672
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:07,740
He put the shorts on Charles
Leeds after he was dead.

673
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:11,244
I believe he did this to make
sure we wouldn't think he was gay.

674
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,583
He's molested
all of his male victims.

675
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:21,086
He may be impotent with
members of the opposite sex.

676
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:23,339
Our forensic psychologists
have projected,

677
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,174
though I'm not sure,

678
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,427
that he may have had sexual
relations with his mother.

679
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:28,989
(LAUGHS)

680
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:37,353
So, how long do you plan
to stay in Washington?

681
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,645
Till we've taken
out the Tooth Fairy.

682
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:40,939
LOUNDS: Can the Tattler rely on
getting the straight stuff from you?

683
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,024
Absolutely.

684
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,652
How does working on this case
affect your sex life?

685
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,197
Mine? It doesn't affect mine,
it affects yours. Go fuck yourself.

686
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,367
- Look, pal of mine, you're news.
- Shoot the pictures.

687
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,035
All right, Stymie,
let's shoot them.

688
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,495
I'm in the shots with Graham.

689
00:52:54,496 --> 00:52:56,247
-What?
-I'm in the shots with you.

690
00:52:56,414 --> 00:52:58,541
Come on, you want this
to look real or not?

691
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:04,088
Make sure the theater sign across the
street is just slightly out of focus.

692
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:06,006
We want him to be able
to read it so he can find it,

693
00:53:06,007 --> 00:53:07,383
but we don't want
to look too obvious.

694
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,552
-You make sure that I look excellent.
-All right, shoot it.

695
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:13,180
One more.

696
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:15,432
-One more.
-That's enough.

697
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:18,268
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?

698
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:19,937
Let's have lunch,
call my service.

699
00:53:19,938 --> 00:53:22,272
Crawford, always a thrill.

700
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:25,902
Dr. Bloom. I need them
on my desk in two hours.

701
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,704
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.

702
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:39,691
Tools and Firearms say
the cutting tool used on

703
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,334
the severed branch was
a common bolt cutter.

704
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:45,045
I got a call from
Asian Studies at Langley.

705
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:46,964
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?

706
00:53:46,965 --> 00:53:51,009
It's a Chinese character considered
a lucky sign in gambling.

707
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,096
That same character appears
on a Mah Jongg piece.

708
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:57,649
It means "Red Dragon." 
Mean anything to you?

709
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,362
No.

710
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,665
I'm having the bureau
fly Molly up tonight.

711
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:07,091
-Huh?
-Well, she said she can get away for one night.

712
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:10,621
I do something wrong?

713
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:11,605
No.

714
00:54:11,606 --> 00:54:13,207
No, it's just the setting, Jack.

715
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,293
- Hm.
- Thanks.

716
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,290
If he shows, and he's smart,

717
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,208
he'll approach you
from the front, pass, turn,

718
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:25,169
try and take you from behind.

719
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,296
- How's your hearing?
- It's good.

720
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,630
You'll wear a wire, one-way.

721
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,800
We'll hear you,
you won't hear us.

722
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:34,261
You checked out a Charter
Arms .44 Special Bulldog?

723
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:34,804
Yeah.

724
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,348
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?

725
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,017
- Glaser Safety Slugs.
- Yeah. Number 12 shots.

726
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,686
Suspended in liquid Teflon
in a copper casing.

727
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,522
On impact it all
opens up in the target.

728
00:54:45,523 --> 00:54:47,691
Guaranteed one-shot stop.

729
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:50,695
- You got body armor?
- Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.

730
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:52,613
I hope you get one.

731
00:54:52,614 --> 00:54:55,366
'Cause he's gone for the head
shot eight of eleven times?

732
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:59,245

WOMAN ON PA: United Flight 849 to
Newark now boarding at Gate 7...

734
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:14,802
United Flight 849 to Newark
now boarding at Gate 7.

735
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:52,382
You didn't cancel the food.

736
00:55:57,011 --> 00:55:59,222
So, where are things?

737
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,600
We got nine days left.

738
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:05,770
We're working on it, doing stuff.

739
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,441
You don't want to talk about
what you're doing, do you?

740
00:56:15,363 --> 00:56:17,282
Hotel rooms...

741
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:19,867
Illicit romance.

742
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,455
We have to stop meeting like this.

743
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:33,380
Remember the first time we met?

744
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:34,882
Yeah.

745
00:56:35,049 --> 00:56:37,719
When we were alone together
in that room.

746
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,846
Even though
I'd never seen you before,

747
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:44,391
we were sitting there, speaking.

748
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:46,727
And something flickered
across your face like a shadow.

749
00:56:46,728 --> 00:56:48,729
I said, "what's that?"

750
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,898
Mm-hmm.

751
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:52,859
Remember what you said?

752
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:58,990
I said, "this is too good to live."

753
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,874
Time is luck, Will.

754
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,462
I know the value of every single day.

755
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:49,517
Someone's coming.

Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

761
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:41,778
- Clear!
- Clear!

762
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:52,413
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!

763
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:56,041
For real. Can you believe that?

00:59:56,042 --> 01:00:02,089
- Pay up.

Mm-hm. I don't want to know
who you are.

01:11:01,748 --> 01:11:04,585
It said you were
in a special hospital.

909
01:11:07,004 --> 01:11:09,547
Well, it was a regular hospital,

910
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:12,509
then I was transferred
into the psychiatric wing.

911
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,597
That bothers you, doesn't it?

912
01:11:17,389 --> 01:11:19,724
I don't know.

913
01:11:19,725 --> 01:11:23,603
Was it because in the papers it
said it was this man Lecter?

914
01:11:23,604 --> 01:11:25,563
Mmm-hmm.

915
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:27,483
What happened?

916
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:33,404
Well, Lecter was attacking college
girls, then he killed them.

917
01:11:33,405 --> 01:11:35,157
How?

918
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:38,952
In bad ways.

919
01:11:40,787 --> 01:11:43,247
He was a psychiatrist.

920
01:11:43,248 --> 01:11:47,628
One of the girls was his patient,
and I went to talk to him about her.

921
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:54,217
I tried to build feelings in my
imagination like the killer had

922
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:56,803
so that I would know
why he did what he did,

923
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,223
because that would
help me find him.

924
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:05,520
When I was sitting in Lecter's office and
I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.

925
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,523
It had pictures of
war wounds in it.

926
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,651
And I knew it was him.

927
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:16,447
So I went to a pay phone down
the hall to call the police

928
01:12:16,448 --> 01:12:18,742
and that's when he attacked me.

929
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:28,752
You and Mom came to see me in the
hospital, and that helped a lot.

930
01:12:29,461 --> 01:12:32,547
But after my body got okay,

931
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:36,843
I still had his thoughts
going around in my head.

932
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:41,139
And I stopped talking to people.

933
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:49,814
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help. And I did.

934
01:12:49,815 --> 01:12:53,986
Then after a while I felt
better, and I was okay again.

01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:32,357
Yeah.

Nowhere.

947

Everything we've tried is either
a dead end or it's backfired.

No.

Hello?

1122
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:39,818
Lecter: Hello, Will.

1123
01:31:39,819 --> 01:31:42,696
I wanted to congratulate you for
the job you did on Mr. Lounds.

1124
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,531
I admire that enormously.

1125
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:47,242
Oh, what a cunning boy
you are, Will.

1126

I'm sick of you crazy 
sons of bitches, Lecter.

You got something
to say, say it.

1128
01:31:51,288 --> 01:31:53,707
Lecter, I want to help you.

1129
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:56,000
You'd be more comfortable
if you relax with yourself.

01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,386
Fight what?

1134
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:07,971
Did you really feel so depressed

1135
01:32:07,972 --> 01:32:11,808
after you shot Mr. Garrett
Jacob Hobbs to death?

1136
01:32:11,809 --> 01:32:15,353
I didn't know you then,
but I think you probably did.

1137
01:32:15,354 --> 01:32:17,856
But it wasn't the act
that got you down, was it?

1138
01:32:17,857 --> 01:32:21,068
Didn't you really feel so bad
because killing him felt so good?

1139
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,404
And why shouldn't it feel good?

1140
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:27,408
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.

01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:30,326
God's terrific.

1142
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:32,829
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

last Wednesday night in Texas

as they were groveling
through a hymn to his majesty.

1145
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,463
Don't you think that felt good?

1146
01:32:44,133 --> 01:32:46,385
Why does it feel good,
Dr. Lecter?

1147
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:51,931
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.

1148
01:32:51,932 --> 01:32:55,102
And if one does what
God does enough times,

1149
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:58,939
one will become as God is.

The dream.

1209
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:02,909
He dreams about
being wanted and desired,

1210
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,996
so he changes people into
beings who want and desire him.

01:38:06,997 --> 01:38:10,083
Changes?
It's a word.

Killing and arranging
the people to imitate it.

1213
01:38:14,838 --> 01:38:17,256
And Lecter told me something.

1214
01:38:17,257 --> 01:38:19,968
If one does what
God does enough times,

1215
01:38:20,135 --> 01:38:22,387
one will become as God is.

You put it together, you get,

1217
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:29,227
if our boy imitates being
wanted and desired enough times,

1218

who is wanted
and desired and accepted.

1220
01:38:34,024 --> 01:38:35,651
It'll all come true.

1221
01:38:39,988 --> 01:38:41,949
But he doesn't take anything.

1222
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,076
There's no souvenirs
taken from the houses.

1223
01:38:45,077 --> 01:38:48,664
He needs souvenirs or
trophies to re-live the event.

1224
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:55,837
Maybe he records it somehow.

1225
01:38:55,838 --> 01:39:00,008
So he could see himself accepted
over and over and over again.

How does he find them?

1229
01:39:12,855 --> 01:39:15,356
When we find out how he found
them, we'll find him.

1230
01:39:15,357 --> 01:39:17,651
There is no connection
between the two families.

lottery, he picked these women.

1234
01:39:24,449 --> 01:39:26,785
There's selection
and design in his choices.

admit we struck out this month.

when he was watching
from the woods.

Why didn't he use the bolt
cutter on the garage door?
