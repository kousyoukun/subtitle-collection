1
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,864
We should've talked
at the boatyard.

2
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,200
You don't wanna
talk about it here.

3
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,871
l'm not falling all over
myself to talk about
it much of anywhere, Jack.

4
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,623
How much do you know?

5
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,707
Not much.

6
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,965
The Birmingham one
was in the papers
over a month ago.

7
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,928
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

8
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,138
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?

9
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,890
No.

10
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,516
Why not?

11
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,143
l quit. Remember?

12
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,983
You look all right now.

13
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,779
l am all right.

14
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,586
lf you can't
look anymore,
l understand.

15
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,507
Don't try to run
a game down on me, Jack.

16
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,350
lf l really didn't need you
to come back, l wouldn't ask.

17
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,893
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

18
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,480
l have three weeks
and a few days until
the next full moon.

19
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:38,402
We have a better chance
to get him fast if you help.

20
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,697
l'll think about it.

21
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,074
Stay and eat.

22
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,211
Hi, Molly.

23
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,309
Think it'll keep
them out, Dad?

24
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,518
Yep.

25
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,190
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?

26
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,274
ln this hatchery?

27
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,610
l'll bet there's
40 or 50 of them.

28
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,530
Crabs get most
of the newborns, huh?

29
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,407
Yeah, but not now.

30
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,951
These are all gonna
make it, guaranteed.

31
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,832
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?

32
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,209
They can't dig under.

33
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,087
That's why we bury
the wire down in the sand.

34
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,800
We need more staples, pal.

35
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,394
You're supposed
to be his friend, Jack.

36
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,605
Why didn't you
leave him alone?

37
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,734
lf he decides
to do it, Molly,

38
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,488
l'll keep him
as far away
from it as l can.

39
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,922
We got it pretty good,
don't we?

40
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,091
We have it more than good.

41
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,220
All that happened to you
before lets you know that.

42
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,518
lf l went back,
l'd only look at evidence.

43
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,188
l wouldn't get
deeply involved.

44
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,358
He'd never even
see me or know my name.

45
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,404
lf they find him,
they'll have to take
him down, not me.

46
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,826
What do you think?

47
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,125

and you're not really asking.

51
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,347

you'd want to be alone, but. . .

That's right.

56
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,436
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.

57
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,942
They transferred
some home movies of both
families onto half-inch VHS.

Thanks.

59

lntruder entered through
kitchen sliding door.

60
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,260
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

61
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,137
His entry was skillful.

62
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,266
All the prints
are smooth gloves.

63
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,479
Blond hair, strong,
size 1 2 shoe imprint.

64
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,819
Blood AB positive,
typed from saliva on glass
from licking the suction cup.

65
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,073
Why didn't he care that
he left saliva on the glass?

66
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,413
lt was hot out that night,

67
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,624
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

68
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,297
lntruder cut Charles Leeds'
throat as he was rising,

69
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,383
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

70
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,844
Bullet entered right
of her navel and lodged
in her lumbar spine,

71
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,596
but she died
of strangulation.

72
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,932
Moderate elevation
of serotonin
and marked increase

73
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,434
of free histamine level
in gunshot wound

74
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,438
indicates she lived
at least five minutes
after she was shot.

75
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,442
All her other injuries
were post-mortem.

76
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:20,113
Direction and velocity
of bloodstains on east wall
indicate arterial spray.

77
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,615
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight

78
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,161
because the intruder
was moving
to the children's room.

79
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,373
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom

80
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,710
and matted sliding
marks on hall carpet
remain unexplained,

81
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,382
as does superficial ligature
mark around Mr. Leeds' chest,

82
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,552
also believed
to be post-mortem.

83
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,601

to touch her with rubber
gloves on, wasn't it?

any talcum powder

Didn't you,
you son of a bitch?

You touched her
with your bare hands,

and then you put
your gloves back on.

00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,103
Order a chopper,
next thing smoking.
l don't care whose it is.

467
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,063
Two, call Alabama
Air National Guard,

468
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,023
get Graham back
here right now.

469
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,067
Then call Documents
and tell them
to scramble a team.

470
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,403
l want everybody moving
five minutes ago.
You understand?

471
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,321
JACK: l have a Documents
team on its way to you

472
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,781
by helicopter
to pick up the note.

473
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,241
Listen, after we've
worked the note,

474
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,659
l want to replace
it in Lecktor's cell.

475
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,244
l don't want Lecktor to know
that we've found it,

476
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,287
he might try to warn
the killer somehow.

477
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,372
Where's Lecktor now?

478
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,581
CHlLTON: Holding cell.

479
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,917
How long can you keep
him in there without
him getting suspicious?

480
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,961
CHILTON: Three, four hours.

481
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,088
Brian, we have a note
coming in on the flight,

482
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,841
possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.

483
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,092
lt has to go
to Hair and Fiber,

484
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,427
Latent Prints,
and then Documents.

485
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,387
Will Graham and l
will be walking it through.

486
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,679
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.

487
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,515
And a couple of blue grains.

488
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,809
Work the hair.

489
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,853
What do we have
for negative comparison?

490
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:26,149
Hair from Lecktor's comb,
whiskers from Lecktor's
razor they let him use.

491
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,818
This is hair from
the security guard.

492
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,592
MAN: How many guys
handled this without gloves?

493
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,469
The guard,
cleanup man, Lecktor.

494
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,346
The cleanup man
scrubbing sinks

495
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,432
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

496
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,643
But the others. . .

497
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,936
One smudge.

498
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,107
Those aren't ridges.

499
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,777
lt's just the texture
of the paper.

500
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,028
l can fume for a print,

501
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,364
but can't guarantee
the iodine stains
would fade out.

502
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,865
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?

503
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,991
No.

504
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,327
We couldn't wash it after.

505
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,288
l can't get a print off this
in the time you've got
to get it back, Will.

506
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,207
BOWMAN: How long do l have?

507
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,291
JACK: Twenty minutes, max.

508
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,543
BOWMAN: The main thing
to find out is,

509
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,003
how was Lecktor supposed
to reply to him?

510
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,881
Which is probably
the missing section,
because at the top it says,

511
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,093
"l hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.

512
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,472
This note was written
in ballpoint,

513
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,643
but it looks like Lecktor
went over this area
with a felt-tip pen,

514
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,062
then tore it away.

515
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,093
You're so sly,

516
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,928
but so am l.

517
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,898
The aniline dyes used
in the ink of the felt-tip
pens like Lecktor used

518
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,151
are transparent to infrared.

519
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,029
The Tooth Fairy's
ballpoint isn't.

520
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,873
This looks like the tip
of a T here, here, and here.

521
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,834
At the end is what
could be the top of an R.

522
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,128
There's three Ts
and an R in "Tattler."

523
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,296
We know our boy reads it.

524
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,006
The article about me
and Lecktor.

525
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,634
l don't know anybody else
that's carried that.

526
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,802
Personal ads.

527
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,142
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecktor to reply to him

528
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,103
through the personal
ad section of
the National Tattler.

529
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,231
The Chicago office
is down there right now
running through their ads.

530
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,484
We have cut into
a line of communication

531
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,653
between the Tooth Fairy
and Lecktor.

532
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,447
lf we find Lecktor's
reply we plan to pull it,

533
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,532
substitute it
with one of our own.

534
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,410
And this is what
the Tooth Fairy
will read. Bill?

535
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:28,414
"Dear Avid Fan,
inherit my mantle and surpass
my achievements.

536
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,709
"Mementoes for you
at Baltimore Central
Left Luggage.

537
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,920
"Ticket number 72683."

538
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,631
lt's a Secret Service
letter drop.

539
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,840
We plan to stake it out.

540
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,008
When he shows,
we'll grab him.

541
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,843
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH: Not yet.

542
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,845
When do they go to press?

543
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,347
JACK: Thirty-five minutes.

544
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,140
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.

545
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,767
There was no print.

546
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,602
Scale counts
and core size of the hair

547
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,105
match the blond hair
found in the Jacobis'.

548
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,607
That note was written
by your man.

549
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,026
Aside from the hair,
three blue grains,

550
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,986
dark flecks,
went to Brian's end.

551
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,698
The grains are commercial
granulated cleanser
with chlorine,

552
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,740
from the cleaning man.

553
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,159
Several particles
of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

554
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,786
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

555
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,414
OVER PHONE: This is Chester.
Who am l talking to?

556
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,040
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

557
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,752
Got a personal ad with
"Avid Fan" in it being
telexed to you right now.

558
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,796
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,

559
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,506
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."

560
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,674
JACK: Oh, Christ.

561
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,135
"l offer 1 00 prayers
for your safety.

562
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,682
"Find help in Galatians
6: 1 1 , 1 5:2,

563
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:31,728

564
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:36,149
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,

565
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,484
"Luke 1 :7."

566
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,236
JACK: Thanks.

567
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,077
Jimmy.

568
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,246
Did you get anywhere
at all identifying him
off the Leeds' prints?

569
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,497
Not yet.

570
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,377
Photography at Langley?

571
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,005
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.

572
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,105
No. And our ad has to go
out in the same book
code Lecktor used,

573
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,607
or he'll know
it wasn't Lecktor
talking to him.

574
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,775
Book code?

575
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,401
"1 00 prayers" could
be the page number,

576
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,903
the paired numbers
could be line and letter.

577
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,154
But what book?
JACK: Not the Bible?

578
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,238
No.

579
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,281
Galatians 1 5:2.

580
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,866
Galatians only
has six chapters.

581
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,950
The same with Jonah 6:8.

582
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,619
Jonah only has
four chapters.

583
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,704
Lecktor was not
using the Bible.

584
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,874
Then the Tooth Fairy
probably named the book
in the part Lecktor tore out.

585
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,375
Right.

586
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,920
What about sweating Lecktor?

587
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,047
They tried sodium amytal
on him three years ago
to find where

588
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,381
he buried a Princeton student.

589
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,841
He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.

590
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,009
JACK: Wonderful.

591
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,722
The Tooth Fairy would have
named a book he knew
Lecktor has access to.

592
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,516
He'd know it from articles
he'd read about Lecktor.

593
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,059
JACK: Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,

594
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,019
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.

595
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,730
Have him meet me
with pictures
of Lecktor's books.

596
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,649
JACK: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.

597
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,157
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.

598
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,285
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.

599
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,498
Or we pull it,
figure out the code
and run our own ad next week.

600
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,541
And lose a week?

601
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,667
We got 1 7 days till
the next full moon.

602
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,420
And l don't like
Lecktor's ad running
without knowing what it says.

603
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,757
lt's your call, Will.

604
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,928
Run it.

605
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,975
And what if it encourages
the Tooth Fairy to do
something else beside write?

606
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,310
We'll all feel sick
for a very long time.

607
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,730
JACK: And if Bowman
still can't figure it out?

608
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,358
Then we'll bait him
with something else
in next week's Tattler.

609
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,943
JACK: What, for instance?

610
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,613
Me.

611
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,742
l don't think
that's a very good idea.

612
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,956
Why not?

613
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,374
Don't you think
we can provoke him?

614
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,793
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.

615
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,461
What l was thinking
about is you.

616
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,173
You're getting deeper
and deeper into this.

617
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,758
Good night.

618
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,843
Sidney.

619
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:09,969
l'll talk to you.

620
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,890
Last time you did that
you did a real good job

621
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,267
of pushing yourself
all out of shape.

622
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,478
You try it on again
or you go through
some big trauma,

623
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,731
you could relapse,
my friend.

624
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,941
Sidney,
don't worry about me.

625
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,194
l'm working the evidence,
making moves. That's all.

626
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,780
l'm fine.

627
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,160
Bowman just struck out.

628
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,621
lt is not books
in Lecktor's cell.

629
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,247
Price?

630
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,665
He just heard.
lt's a bust-out.

631
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,251
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction

632
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,211
if we could ever
find the guy.

633
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,548
But he must never
have been printed because
he is not in our index.

634
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,134
We are not gonna
identify him off the print.

635
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,306
l'll use Lounds.

636
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,516
What for?

637
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,519
Our boy doesn't
read the New York Times
literary supplement.

638
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,605
He reads Lounds
in the Tattler.

639
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,654
What else should we cover?

640
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,615
He put the shorts
on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.

641
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,202
l believe
he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.

642
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,041
He's molested
all of his male victims.

643
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,461
He may be impotent
with members
of the opposite sex.

644
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,089

psychologists
have projected,

645

646
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,802
that he may have had sexual
relations with his mother.

648
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,978
So, how long do you plan
to stay in Washington?

649
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,479
Till we've taken
out the Tooth Fairy.

650

LOUNDS: Can the Tattler rely
on getting the straight stuff
from you?

651
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,816
Absolutely.

652
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,443
How does working on this case
affect your sex life?

653
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,989
Mine? lt doesn't affect mine,
it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.

to look real or not?

660

Make sure the theater sign
across the street is just
slightly out of focus.

661
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,798
We want him to be able
to read it so he can find it,

662
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,882
but we don't want
to look too obvious.

663
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,136
You make sure that
l look excellent.
All right, shoot it.

on the tree?
Yeah?

considered a lucky sign
in gambling.

That same character appears
on a Mah Jongg piece.

and l went to talk
to him about her.

873

l tried to build feelings
in my imagination
like the killer had

874

so that l would know
why he did what he did,

help me find him.

in Lecktor's office

l saw a book on his shelf.

down the hall
to call the police

and that's when
he attacked me.

came to see me
in the hospital,

But after my body got okay,

885
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:34,299
l still had his thoughts
going around in my head.

886
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,636
And l stopped
talking to people.

887
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,435
And a doctor friend of mine,
a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help.

888
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,145
And l did.

l felt better,

Fight what?

1098
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,053
Did you really
feel so depressed

1099
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:09,514
after you shot
Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs
to death?

l didn't know you then,
but l think you probably did.

1101

But it wasn't the act
that got you down, was it?

1102
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,941
Didn't you really feel
so bad because killing
him felt so good?

1103
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,026
And why shouldn't
it feel good?

1104
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:25,239
lt must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.

in Texas

through a hymn
to his majesty.

01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,252
Don't you think
that felt good?

1110
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,508
Why does it feel good,
Dr. Lecktor?

1111
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,887
lt feels good, Will,
because God has power.

1112
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:53,392
And if one does what
God does enough times,

1113
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:57,020
one will become as God is.

He dreams about
being wanted and desired,

1179
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:02,075
so he changes
people into beings
who want and desire him.

My heart bleeds
for him as a child.

Someone took a kid
and manufactured a monster.

1198
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:55,879
At the same time,
as an adult,
he's irredeemable.

1199
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:59,466
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.

1200
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:03,595
As an adult, someone
should blow this sick

Do you think that's
a contradiction, Jack?

of understanding

What about the mirrors?

He uses the mirrors
to see it happen.

But he doesn't take anything.

There's no souvenirs
taken from the houses.

1207
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:45,637
He needs souvenirs
or trophies
to re-live the event.

1208
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:52,185
Maybe he records it somehow.

1209
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:57,315
So he could see himself

when he was watching
from the woods.

1241

Why didn't he use
the bolt cutter
