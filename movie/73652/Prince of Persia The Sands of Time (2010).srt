00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,800
Long ago, in a land far away,

3
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,200
there once rose an empire that
stretched from the steppes of China

4
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
to the shores of the Mediterranean.

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,900
That empire was Persia.

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,300
Fierce in battle, wise in victory,

7
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,400
where the Persian sword went,
order followed.

8
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,600
The Persian king, Sharaman,
ruled with his brother, Nizam,

9
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,000
upon the principles of loyalty
and brotherhood.

10
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,200
The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Rejoice!

12
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,400
But in the eyes of the gods,

13
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,600
the King's family was not yet complete,

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,600
not until the day he witnessed
a single act of courage

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,800
by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.

16
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,300
Get out of the way!

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,100
Stop!

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
- Stop!
- Help!

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Run! Run, Bis! Run!

20
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Stay here.

21
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,900
Stop him! He's getting away!

22
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,600
Let go of me!

23
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Come here!

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,300
In the King's name!

25
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,600
What is your name, boy?

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,300
- Dastan, sire.
- And your parents?

27
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,700
Boy!

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,200
Brother, take him up.

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,900
Moved by what he saw,

30
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,000
the King adopted the boy, Dastan,
into his family.

31
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
A son with no royal blood

32
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,700
and no eye on his throne.

33
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,500
But perhaps there was
something else at work that day,

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,700
something beyond
simple understanding,

35
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,000
the day a boy
from the unlikeliest of places became

36
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,900
a prince of Persia.

37
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,700
The fabled Alamut.
Even more stunning than I'd imagined.

38
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,200
Don't be fooled by beauty, Prince Tus.
It's a city like any other.

39
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,300
Soft countries make soft men.

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,500
They stoop to treachery
and now must pay for it.

41
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,700
My father's made clear
Alamut's not to be touched.

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Some consider it sacred.

43
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,300
But since our wise father isn't here,
the decision rests with me.

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll have one last council
with my noble uncle

45
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,900
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv and...

46
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,300
Where's Dastan?

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
Come on! I bet my entire
month's allowance on this!

48
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,900
This is embarrassing!

49
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,500
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Get in there!

50
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,500
Is that all you got?

51
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,700
Prince Dastan!

52
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,900
Where is Prince Dastan?

53
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,000
Prince Dastan isn't here!

54
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,700
Your Highness, please.

55
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,900
Prince Tus has convened
a war council.

56
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm on my way.

57
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,300
Our finest spy intercepted a caravan
leaving Alamut.

58
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Swords of the best workmanship.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
Steel-tipped arrows.

60
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,900
And promise of payment
from the warlord Kosh to Alamut.

61
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,300
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,600
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Koshkhan.

63
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,000
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.

64
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,400
Or our soldiers will fall from its walls.

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,900
Our orders were to subdue Koshkhan,
not to attack Alamut.

66
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,100
Wise words, little brother.

67
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,500
Words won't stop our enemies

68
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,300
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,100
We attack at dawn.

70
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,100
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.

71
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
Thoughts to share, Garsiv?

72
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
I ride at the head of the Persian army.

73
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,600
Dastan leads a company
of street rabble.

74
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,200
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

75
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,800
The honour of first blood
should be mine.

76
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,300
Garsiv, your hand is
on your sword again.

77
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,700
- Where it should be!
- Oh, my brothers!

78
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,900
Ever eager.

79
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,700
It's said the princess of Alamut
is a beauty without equal.

80
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.

81
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,800
There can be no doubt
of your courage, Dastan.

82
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,700
But you're not ready for this.

83
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.

84
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Princess Tamina.

85
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,100
The Persian army, my princess,
has not moved on.

86
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,600
Their faith has little love for any truth

87
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,300
other than its own.

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,200
Perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.

89
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong.

90
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
Nor is their aim.

91
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,900
Gather the council.

92
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Tell them I sit in the High Temple.
I must pray.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
The High Temple?

94
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,700
Alamut hasn't been breached
in a thousand years.

95
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,400
Everything changes with time.

96
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,900
We should know this best of all.

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,800
Remind me why we're disobeying
your brother's orders?

98
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Because Garsiv only knows
how to attack head-on.

99
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
It'll be a massacre.

100
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,300
The Alamutians will be busy
with the main gate,

101
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
so we'll slip through the side.

102
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,300
Have you been drinking?

103
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,100
That's our way in.

104
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,100
There are two gates.
The outer one's easy.

105
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,100
It's the inner gate that's impossible.

106
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,300
That gate mechanism is protected
by two manned guard towers.

107
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,900
Yeah, well,
there's always a way in, Bis.

108
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,300
You take care of the outer gate,

109
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
you leave the impossible one to me.

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You know, sire, you won't be happy
till you get us all killed.

111
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
Wonderful speech, Bis. Rousing.

112
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sound the alarm!

113
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Hold this.

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Watch your back.

115
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Eastern gate's open.

116
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
That's Dastan's man.
He's gotten in. Dastan's done it.

117
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Redeploy to the eastern gate.

118
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,600
Redeploy to the eastern gate!

119
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,200
Come on.

120
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
They've breached the eastern gate.

121
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,300
Collapse the passages to the chamber.

122
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,900
Princess.

123
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,100
Go now, everyone.

124
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,200
You know what you must do.

125
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,000
Above all else, it must be kept safe.

126
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
Out of the way!

127
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Silly songs and scented smoke
will do little for you now!

128
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,500
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, eh, Garsiv?

129
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,700
So for once the stories are true.

130
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,000
We know you secretly build weapons
for enemies of Persia.

131
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,700
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.

132
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,200
And what weapons we had,
you overcame.

133
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,500
Our spies say differently.

134
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,000
- You can save a lot of pain...
- All the pain in the world

135
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
will not help you find something
that does not exist.

136
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,000
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.

137
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,200
Join hands with Persia's future king.

138
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,700
I'll die first.

139
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,300
That can be arranged.

140
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't!

141
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Prince Tus.

142
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,900
Promise me the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.

143
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,500
- Hey, the Lion of Persia!
- The Lion of Persia!

144
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,100
They're calling you the Lion of Persia.

145
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,800
You've never excelled
at following orders, Dastan.

146
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No.

147
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No.

148
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,500
No! We have some celebrating to do.

149
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
There is, however, tradition.

150
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Since you took the honour
of first assault,

151
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,700
you owe me a gift of homage.

152
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,200
A beautiful dagger.

153
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,500
He delivered you the city
and its princess.

154
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,900
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.

155
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,100
First dispatch has just arrived,
my prince.

156
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Wonderful news.

157
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,500
Your father has interrupted his prayers
at the eastern palace to join us.

158
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,700
No doubt to commend us
on our great victory.

159
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,000
We had indications
Alamut was arming our enemies.

160
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,400
Indications?

161
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,900
You better have more than indications

162
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,500
to occupy a holy city with my troops!

163
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
This adventure

164
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,100
won't sit with our allies.

165
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,100
But I suppose
you didn't take that into account.

166
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,900
Don't look to your uncle, boy.

167
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,400
The decision, and its consequences,
rest with me.

168
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,700
I know you're eager to wear the crown,

169
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,500
but trust me when I tell you
you're not yet ready.

170
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
No man would know
better than you, Father.

171
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Because your trust is something
I deeply cherish,

172
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,000
I will oversee the search
for weapons myself.

173
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I vow I will not stand before you
until I hold proof of Alamut's treachery.

174
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,700
The third step is the hardest!

175
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,700
Brother! Brother!

176
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,100
We've uncovered signs of tunnels
on the eastern edge of the city.

177
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm on my way there now.

178
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,700
But you'll miss the banquet!

179
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,900
You and Garsiv can handle Father
in my absence.

180
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,900
- You do have a gift to honour him with?
- Of course!

181
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
- Bis, gift!
- What?

182
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,300
It's been momentarily misplaced.

183
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,300
I knew you'd forget.
The prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.

184
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,200
The holiest in the eastern lands.
A gift the King will appreciate.

185
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,800
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favour.

186
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,800
A rare jewel.

187
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,700
Present her to the King for me
this evening, Dastan.

188
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,500
Sure you really want
another wife, brother?

189
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,900
Listen to me, Dastan.

190
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,300
A marriage to the Princess assures me
the loyalty of her people.

191
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,300
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.

192
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
If Father doesn't approve our union,

193
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,600
I want you to end her life
with your own hand.

194
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,300
So, I'm escorted by Prince Dastan,

195
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,500
the Lion of Persia.

196
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,300
Must feel wonderful
winning such acclaim

197
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
for destroying such an innocent city.

198
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,000
A pleasure to meet you, too, Princess.

199
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,000
And allow me to offer that if punishing
the enemies of my king is a crime,

200
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,700
then it's one I'll gladly repeat.

201
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,700
Then you are a true prince of Persia.

202
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,000
Brutal, without honour.

203
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Don't make the mistake of thinking
you know me, Princess.

204
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,700
And what more is there?

205
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,300
Wait here with Her Highness.

206
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,200
If you can manage it,

207
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,900
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

208
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,500
For your own good.

209
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,000
You've eased Father's anger, Uncle.

210
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,900
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the King, Dastan.

211
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,300
As long as you remember your most
important duty, you should do well.

212
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,900
And what's that?

213
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,100
Making sure his wine glass stays full.

214
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,900
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank

215
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,900
of great Persian warriors.

216
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,900
We missed you, Father.

217
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,100
I was praying for you
and your brothers, Dastan.

218
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,500
Family.

219
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,700
The bond between brothers,
that is the sword

220
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,400
that defends our empire.

221
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,200
And I pray that
that sword remains strong.

222
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,700
I was hoping my actions would spare
our men unnecessary losses.

223
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,500
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan,

224
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,800
acting boldly and courageously
to bring a victory and spare lives.

225
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,500
But a great man
would've stopped the attack

226
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,400
from happening at all. A great man

227
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,600
would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,

228
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,100
no matter who was ordering it.

229
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,500
The boy I saw in that square

230
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,600
was capable of being
more than just good,

231
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,400
but of being great.

232
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,500
Well, in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

233
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,500
Some questioned
the wisdom of my bringing a boy

234
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
from the streets into my family.

235
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,300
I saw a boy whose blood wasn't noble,

236
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,000
but whose character was.

237
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,300
A king in spirit.

238
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,500
Thank you, Father.

239
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,100
Thank you, Father.

240
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,100
May I present
the prayer robe of Alamut's Regent.

241
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
What can I grant you in return?

242
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,300
Roham!

243
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,100
May I present Princess Tamina.

244
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,100
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.

245
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,200
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.

246
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,700
In all of my travels,

247
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,900
I have never looked upon
a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

248
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,800
You should have seen it before
your horde of camel-riding illiterates

249
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,200
descended upon it.

250
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,900
Clearly she will make a fine queen.

251
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,200
But Tus already has enough wives.

252
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,300
You, Dastan, might take fewer chances

253
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,200
if such a jewel
waited in your chambers.

254
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,400
The Princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.

255
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
What say you, Dastan?

256
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,800
He plunges into a hundred foes
without thought,

257
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
but before marriage
he stands frozen with fear.

258
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,400
And there are those
who say he is not yet wise.

259
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,800
I need a drink.

260
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,500
Stand aside! Out of my way!

261
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Father.

262
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,000
God help us! The robe is poisoned!

263
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,100
Somebody help him!

264
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,400
- The robe Dastan gave him!
- Why?

265
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,100
- Somebody help him!
- Seize the murderer!

266
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,900
- Somebody help him!
- My prince, save yourself!

267
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
Seize him!

268
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Move!

269
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Bis!

270
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Bis!

271
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,700
Come with me!

272
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,100
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here.

273
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
You're going to need my help.

274
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,800
Come on!

275
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,300
- Close the gate!
- That way!

276
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,300
Close the gate!

277
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,600
Get down!

278
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,100
There! After the murderer!

279
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,900
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!

280
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,200
Aksh, come on!

281
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,100
My loyal subjects,

282
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,100
the whole world grieves at the death
of our beloved king.

283
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,000
We are all stricken by his loss.

284
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,300
That the murder came
at Prince Dastan's hand

285
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,200
only makes our pain worse.

286
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
I didn't murder my father.

287
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,500
That robe was given to me
by my brother.

288
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,900
Tus did this.

289
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,200
And now he stands to be crowned king.

290
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,900
I didn't kill my father.

291
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,700
I believe you.

292
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,200
You shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have let you come.

293
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,600
But you did.

294
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
I promised my brother I'd kill you
if he couldn't have you.

295
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,700
Well,

296
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,900
the solution would be to kiss me

297
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,200
and then kill me.

298
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
But I have a better solution.

299
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,900
I kill you,

300
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
and your problems are solved!

301
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,900
Perhaps we can find another solution.

302
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,600
Well, the solution would be to kiss me,
then kill me.

303
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,500
But I have a better solution.

304
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,400
- No.
- I kill you!

305
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,200
Give back what you stole, Persian!

306
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,200
Don't!

307
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
- Did you see that?
- See what?

308
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,500
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.

309
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,700
Again?

310
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,100
You've used up all the sand!

311
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,700
What?

312
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,100
What is this?

313
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,600
Incredible.

314
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,700
Releasing the sand

315
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,100
turns back time.

316
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,800
And only the holder of the dagger
is aware of what's happened.

317
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,500
He can go back and alter events,
change time,

318
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
and no one knows but him.

319
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,900
How much can it unwind?

320
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,900
- Answer me, Princess.
- You destroyed my city!

321
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,000
Our invasion wasn't
about weapon forges.

322
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
It was about this dagger.

323
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,300
After the battle,
Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.

324
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,200
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

325
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,300
With it he could change anything.

326
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
He could change the course
of a critical moment in battle.

327
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,300
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

328
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,700
He wouldn't just be king, he'd be the
most powerful ruler Persia's ever seen.

329
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,300
Greater even than my father.

330
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,500
It was all about this dagger!

331
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,400
My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice,

332
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,900
and as such, I have doubled
the reward for his capture.

333
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,700
Meanwhile, I shall strive
to protect our empire,

334
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,000
as my father would have demanded.

335
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
A new reign has begun.

336
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,700
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

337
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,300
And Aksh is the most famous horse
in the empire.

338
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,200
- This will obscure his tracks.
- Tracks where? Where are you going?

339
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,100
To Avrat,
where my father will be buried.

340
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,300
You're wanted for the King's murder

341
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,700
and you're going to
march into his funeral

342
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
alongside thousands
of Persian soldiers?

343
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, Nizam will be there.
He's the only one I can trust.

344
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
He'll see I was set up by Tus.

345
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,100
Step aside, Princess.

346
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,100
Every road to Avrat will be covered
with Persian troops.

347
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,900
I'm not taking roads. I'm going
through the Valley of the Slaves.

348
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,200
No one goes near that wasteland.

349
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,500
It's filled with murdering cutthroats.

350
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
So they say.

351
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,500
- Your whole plan is suicide!
- My brother murdered my father

352
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,100
and left his blood on my hands.
If I die trying to set that right,

353
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,300
then so be it.

354
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,800
So you're going to leave me here
in the middle of nowhere?

355
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,300
Noble Dastan, abandoning
a helpless woman in the wilderness!

356
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,900
What does your precious honour
have to say about that?

357
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,000
Give me the strength not to kill her.

358
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Mount up. We can't be far behind him.

359
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,200
Without the right sand,
it's just another knife.

360
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,900
Not even very sharp.

361
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
This sand, is there more of it?

362
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,600
Of course not.

363
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,400
Well, how can I get some?

364
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,300
Try standing on your head
and holding your breath.

365
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
See what you were looking for, Prince?

366
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,600
Start walking.

367
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,000
If you can't prove to your uncle
how the dagger works,

368
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,800
why in the world would he believe you?

369
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,700
It's not your problem, Princess.

370
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,300
You know, you really walk like one.

371
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,100
Head held high, chest out,
long, stomping strides.

372
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,800
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

373
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,700
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth the world is yours,

374
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,200
and actually believing it.

375
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
I wasn't born in a palace like you.

376
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,500
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,

377
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,900
where I lived if I fought
and I clawed for it.

378
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,500
Then how did you become a prince?

379
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,300
The King marched into the market
one day, and he...

380
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,200
I don't know. He...

381
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,100
He found me.

382
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,900
He took me in. He gave me a family.
He gave me a home.

383
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,300
What you're looking at

384
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,400
is the walk of a man
who just lost everything.

385
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,600
Welcome to the Valley of the Slaves,
Your Highness.

386
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm desperate for a drop of water.

387
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,600
That's more than we have, since you
emptied our canteen hours ago.

388
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,700
I wasn't born of this desert
like you Persians,

389
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,300
all shrivelled and angry.

390
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,700
My constitution is much more delicate.

391
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,800
I think you mean "spoiled."

392
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,900
The wells of Alamut are famed
for their clean, cold water.

393
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Perhaps less time admiring your wells
and more time guarding your walls,

394
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
and you wouldn't be here.

395
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,300
A miracle!

396
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,200
I've silenced the Princess!

397
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,800
Tamina?

398
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,600
Tamina?

399
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Can you hear me?

400
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
Yes, Dastan, I can hear you.

401
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,900
Do you know where you are, Persian?

402
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,700
And yet you enter still?

403
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
In the heart of Sudan,
there is a tribe of warriors

404
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,500
known as the Ngbaka.

405
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,200
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.

406
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
The Ngbaka are masters
of the throwing knife.

407
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Wielding blades said to have been
blessed by the Creator himself.

408
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,700
Their aim is so murderously accurate
they can decapitate three men

409
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
with one strike.

410
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh, I wouldn't even bother doing that
if I were you. Do you know why?

411
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,700
This is Seso. He's a Ngbaka.

412
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,200
I had the good fortune of saving his life,

413
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,700
which means that he is now
enduringly indebted to me.

414
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
So tell me, Persian,

415
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,300
is there any good reason
why I shouldn't tell Seso

416
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,500
to put his next throw just a little higher?

417
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,900
So! This is the one, eh?

418
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,300
Yes! You were right. She's not bad.

419
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,100
She could smell a bit better, though.

420
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,500
Still, we have a deal.

421
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,100
Clever princess.

422
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,400
Deal? What deal?

423
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,500
- Such a noble prince!
- Such a gentle princess!

424
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,700
How taken you were
with my fainting act,

425
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,100
eagerly leaping to assist
the fallen beauty.

426
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,700
Who said you were a beauty?

427
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,100
There must be a reason
why you can't take your eyes off me.

428
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,700
I...

429
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,900
I don't trust you.

430
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,200
And you're not my type.

431
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm not some desperate slave girl.

432
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,300
I'm actually capable
of voicing my own thoughts!

433
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,600
Yeah, too many for my taste!

434
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,300
Oh, yeah.
She'll make a very nice addition.

435
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,900
What do you intend to do with her?

436
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,200
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?

437
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,700
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.

438
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,800
It's hard for me to admit,

439
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,300
but you were right.

440
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,100
I did see what I was looking for.

441
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Dastan, listen to me.

442
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
When my uncle sees the power
of this dagger, he'll believe me.

443
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,900
Dastan, I know I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

444
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh, but your lies are so clever.

445
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,600
I am the guardian of a divine covenant.

446
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,100
- That dagger is sacred.
- Well...

447
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
It was being smuggled to safety
when you stole it.

448
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,800
If the dagger gets
into the wrong hands...

449
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,100
I will take care of your knife.

450
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,700
You won't want to miss this.

451
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
You don't understand what's at stake!

452
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,800
This is a matter for the gods, not man!

453
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,300
- Your gods, not mine.
- Come on!

454
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Come on!

455
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,900
- Ostrich racing?
- Yeah. Every Tuesday and Thursday.

456
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,600
Whatever they lack in beauty,
they make up for in fighting spirit.

457
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,000
And the races are easy to fix.

458
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,600
I've heard all these
terrible stories of this place.

459
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,200
The bloodthirsty slaves
murdering their masters?

460
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,700
That's a good story.
It's well-told, ever-evolving.

461
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,800
Yeah, but, alas, untrue.

462
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,300
But the skeletons that we saw
at the front...

463
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,600
I bought those
from a gypsy in Bukhara.

464
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,600
I crafted our lurid reputation

465
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,100
in order to fend off
the most insidious evil

466
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,500
that's been lurking
this forsaken country of ours.

467
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,900
You know what I'm talking about?

468
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Taxes.

469
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,800
And all these Persians

470
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,200
with their armies, their fortresses,
their roads.

471
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,400
Who pays for it all?
The small businessman!

472
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,400
See, that's why I started
a little campaign

473
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,200
to spread some false notoriety.

474
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,200
I spread it like a venerable disease
in a Turkish harem.

475
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,400
Behold the mighty ostrich!

476
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,800
Come on, my beauty!

477
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,200
I love this!

478
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,900
And the tax collectors steer clear of me
and my customers.

479
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,700
Everybody's happy.

480
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,700
Hey! Get the girls on!

481
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,700
Get the girls on! Come on!
Crowd control!

482
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,300
Don't just stand there! Run, don't walk!

483
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
If you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages!

484
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,500
Now, don't look at me like that.
You know what I'm talking about!

485
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,400
Do your job! Crowd control! Thank you!

486
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,900
You know, I think our little arrangement

487
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,600
is gonna work out very well,
young man.

488
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,700
Don't touch!

489
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,000
She's a lively one!
Where did you find her?

490
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,400
In the slave markets of Lur.

491
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,800
I was headed to Iraq
to trade her for a camel

492
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,300
when she attacked me.

493
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,300
The camels are safer.

494
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,500
Noble Sheikh Amar,
I appreciate your hospitality.

495
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,900
You run a fine establishment,

496
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,100
but if you could give me
the supplies that we...

497
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,300
You know something, Persian?

498
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,100
You bear a remarkable resemblance
to the disgraced prince

499
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,900
who fled after murdering the King.

500
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?

501
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,800
- Yes, you have.
- Yeah. Nothing beats a good story, eh?

502
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,100
But yours, however,
trading her in for a camel?

503
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,800
Please! I mean, look at her.
She's worth at least two.

504
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,200
And as for you, young man,

505
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,100
did you know your brother's offered
a reward for you

506
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,800
which, quite frankly, between you
and me, borders on the obscene?

507
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,400
I'd trade in my own mother
for that kind of gold.

508
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,900
What? You didn't know
what she was like.

509
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,600
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

510
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,100
Wait, wait, wait. Look. That...

511
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,100
- Nice knife.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

512
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
It's nothing.

513
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,300
- No, look, that's worthless!
- Really?

514
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,800
Melt it down for the jewels.

515
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,700
What's the boy doing?

516
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,300
No, you might kill a bird!

517
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,300
Hey! Over here!

518
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,900
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

519
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,200
Get to the tunnel!

520
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,900
Look at this! That's it!

521
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,900
No more fermented goat's milk
after the third race! You hear me?

522
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,100
Get after him! Come on!

523
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,700
- The gate!
- Get him!

524
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,100
Stop!

525
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,600
Lift the lever! Lt'll open the gate!

526
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,100
- Give me the dagger!
- What? You're...

527
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,600
This is not the time! Just lift that lever!

528
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,800
Give me the dagger!

529
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

530
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,500
Move, Princess!

531
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,000
Persian!

532
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Dastan!

533
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Persian!

534
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,600
Looking for this? Key?

535
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,300
Next time, you!

536
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,700
They've all come
for my father's funeral.

537
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,600
There are 100 Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

538
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,200
Maybe more.
If you want to stay close to this dagger,

539
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,900
you're going to have
to help me into Avrat.

540
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
All these foreign dignitaries,

541
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
I'm guessing you know a few.

542
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,800
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

543
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,400
The Mughals of the Hindu Kush
are a noble people.

544
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,100
You should be honoured.

545
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,500
Oh, yes. Terribly.

546
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,100
Dastan, where's the dagger?

547
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,200
You're welcome to search me for it.

548
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,100
You'll have to be very thorough.

549
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,100
Tus isn't here.
He must still be in Alamut.

550
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
The sand that fuels the dagger,

551
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
there's more of it hidden
somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

552
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,500
That's why Tus stays there.

553
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,900
That's what he's got our army
searching for.

554
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,100
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

555
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,000
That's impossible.

556
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,400
Difficult, not impossible.

557
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,700
Or more proof you're insane.

558
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,700
Then why do you look so impressed?

559
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,800
Out of the way! Make way!

560
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,900
- Turn around.
- What?

561
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Turn around!

562
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,000
You used to buy those for me
when I was a boy.

563
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,700
You used to spit the seeds at Garsiv.

564
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,300
You should not have
brought me here, Dastan.

565
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,700
I had no choice, Uncle.

566
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,100
Follow me.

567
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,100
I didn't kill Father.

568
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,300
You know I would never do
such a thing.

569
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,200
Your actions speak otherwise.

570
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,100
But I had no choice but to flee.

571
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,200
Tus gave me that cloak.

572
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,100
- He was the one who poisoned it.
- Dastan.

573
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,600
Well, he's not here, is he?

574
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,700
At his father's funeral.
Instead, he remains in Alamut.

575
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,100
Our allies will see
our invasion was just.

576
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,300
The search for
Alamut's weapons forges is important.

577
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,300
Yes, but not if there are none.

578
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,800
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

579
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,800
Tus is after power.
That's why he murdered Father.

580
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,900
And now he searches not for weapons,

581
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,400
but for the sand
that fuels a mystical device.

582
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,900
This is why you brought me here,
Dastan? Mystical devices?

583
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,000
Do you remember, after the battle,

584
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,000
you stopped Tus
from taking the dagger I'd won?

585
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,100
That dagger is the reason
he invaded Alamut.

586
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,500
This dagger, you have it with you?

587
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,500
Yes.

588
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,700
It has incredible powers.

589
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,700
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

590
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,300
What? No, it was in there.

591
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
Then where's your so-called evidence?

592
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,900
Tamina.

593
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,800
I...

594
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,400
Your hands are burned.

595
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
Yes.

596
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,300
From trying to pull
the poisoned cloak off your father.

597
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,900
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

598
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,100
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

599
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,700
It's just that

600
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,500
Tus is my brother.

601
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,900
How could he betray me like this?

602
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,100
I can't say, Dastan. Perhaps he

603
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,700
never respected you as you deserve,

604
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,500
only saw you as someone he could use.

605
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,300
Someone to keep his wine glass filled?

606
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,300
My service to your father was different.

607
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,500
We shared the same blood, Dastan.

608
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,900
How many times did Father speak
of you saving him from that lion?

609
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,800
- That was his favourite story.
- One of many, yes.

610
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,600
No, that was his favourite.

611
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,900
I'm afraid you're
speaking in riddles, Dastan.

612
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,800
Wait! Dastan!

613
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,600
Over here!

614
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,900
Murderer!

615
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,500
I didn't kill Father!

616
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,600
Out of the way! Get out of the way!

617
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,900
What are you going to do now?

618
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,800
Where is he?

619
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,300
Where is he?

620
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,300
Hey.

621
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,600
Garsiv.

622
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,900
I didn't kill Father.

623
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,700
Then God will pardon you

624
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,500
after your head rolls.

625
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,600
Not fighting with sticks any more,
little brother.

626
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,100
That's all you got?

627
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,500
Your Majesty.

628
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,000
I thought you were staying in Alamut.

629
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,600
Tell me about Dastan, Uncle.

630
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,600
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me.

631
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,500
In the marketplace. I just got away.

632
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,800
Tus, my death would weaken
your young reign.

633
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,100
Dastan hopes to stir a rebellion.

634
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,400
- He wants the throne?
- I fear so, my lord.

635
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,100
Putting Dastan on trial would
only give him a stage for his sedition.

636
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,900
My advice would be to avoid a trial.

637
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,900
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.

638
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,500
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

639
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,700
a public trial will best communicate
the king I hope to be.

640
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,900
Strong, honouring the rule of law.

641
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,600
We are not savages.

642
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,700
You grow more a king every day.

643
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,800
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

644
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,000
I need to speak with our guests.

645
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,300
Oh, about them, my lord.
Their practices are unusual.

646
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,300
The servants have seen things,
heard strange sounds.

647
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,900
Last week, one of the horses vanished.

648
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,400
Well, just make sure
the servants keep their mouths shut.

649
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,900
Or I promise you,

650
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,100
they will vanish, as well.

651
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,500
I have another task for you, Hassansin,

652
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,800
but you'll have to be quick.
Your prey has a head start.

653
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,600
You brought what I requested?

654
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,600
These practices,
they don't interfere with your skills?

655
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,100
In the trance
we can see visions of our future.

656
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,100
Visions of death.

657
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,200
A destiny

658
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
and a curse.

659
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,100
In that trance, we can find anything,

660
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,500
including your nephew, Prince Dastan.

661
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,800
Then I hope you shall see more death,

662
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,500
soon.

663
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,900
Get down! It's a Persian patrol!

664
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,300
Garsiv.

665
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,600
What aren't you telling me?

666
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,300
The tribesmen left.

667
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,500
Maybe they tired of your penchant
for lies and backstabbing.

668
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,700
I had no choice but to leave you.

669
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,300
I take it your uncle didn't listen.

670
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It wasn't Tus that killed my father.
It was Nizam.

671
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,300
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burned.

672
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,500
He said it happened trying to pull off
the cloak that killed my father.

673
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,900
I've gone over and over it in my mind.

674
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,700
He never touched the cloak.
He must have handled it before.

675
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
It was Nizam who poisoned it.

676
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,000
What good does turning back
a few moments of time do my uncle?

677
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,400
None.

678
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,400
He murdered my father
for more than just a dagger.

679
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,400
What aren't you telling me?

680
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,000
You know, you've got quick hands.

681
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,400
But so do I.

682
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,500
If you want it back,
you tell me everything.

683
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,700
No more games, no more lies.

684
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,000
Can we get out of here?

685
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,700
Only a princess would think
she could outrun a sandstorm.

686
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,200
Nizam's coming to kill us.
He needs me dead.

687
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,800
I need to know why.

688
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,100
In Alamut rests the beating heart
of all life on Earth,

689
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,700
the Sandglass of the Gods.

690
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,400
Long ago,
the gods looked down on man

691
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,500
and saw nothing
but greed and treachery.

692
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,100
And so they sent
a great sandstorm to destroy all,

693
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,400
wipe clean the face of the Earth.

694
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,600
But one young girl begged the gods
to give mankind another chance,

695
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,800
offering her life in exchange.

696
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,700
Seeing the purity within,

697
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,500
the gods were reminded
of man's potential for good.

698
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,200
And so they swept the sands
into the Sandglass.

699
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,700
The dagger was given to the girl
who saved man,

700
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,700
making her the first Guardian.

701
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,200
The dagger blade is the only thing
that can pierce the Sandglass

702
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,100
and remove the Sands of Time,

703
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,600
but the handle only holds one minute.

704
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,000
What if one were to place the dagger
in the Sandglass

705
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and press the jewel button
at the same time?

706
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,700
Sand would flow through endlessly.

707
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,400
You could turn back time
as far as you like.

708
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,200
Yes, but it is forbidden.

709
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,900
When my father was a boy,

710
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,700
Nizam saved his life hunting.

711
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,100
One day, the two princes
were stalking a beautiful buck.

712
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,400
But they were unaware
of a lioness stalking them.

713
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,500
Nizam saved Sharaman.

714
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,200
My father told us the story
over and over again.

715
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,900
I don't understand.

716
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,000
Nizam wishes to go back in time
and undo what he did.

717
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
Not save my father. Let him die.

718
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,300
Then he would be king for a lifetime,

719
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,400
and my brothers would never be born.

720
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,800
Storm's passed.

721
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,000
Dastan, the sands contained within
the Sandglass are incredibly powerful.

722
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,300
Opening the dagger while
it's inside the glass breaks the seal.

723
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,300
That would destroy the Sandglass,

724
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,100
causing it to crack and shatter.

725
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,700
The Sands of Time
would no longer be contained.

726
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,300
And they would carry
the gods' wrath with them once more,

727
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,100
destroying everything in their path.

728
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And all of mankind would pay
for Nizam's treachery.

729
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,900
This is all that would be left of us.

730
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,000
The secret Guardian Temple
outside Alamut is a sanctuary,

731
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,100
the one place
the dagger can be hidden safely,

732
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,300
the only way to stop this Armageddon.

733
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,300
That's the truth, Dastan.

734
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,800
Give me back the dagger

735
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,800
so that I can take it there.

736
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,200
I can't do that.

737
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,400
I'm coming with you.

738
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,700
You're going to help me?

739
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,500
We could sit here and chat,
or you could get on the horse.

740
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,700
Our journey is blessed.

741
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,600
We'll stop for water and push
for the mountain pass by nightfall.

742
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,100
You enjoy telling me what to do.

743
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,000
Only because you're so good
at following orders.

744
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,100
Yeah. Don't press your luck.

745
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,200
Persian!

746
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,300
We parted under
such rushed circumstances,

747
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,100
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

748
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,300
We've been tracking you for a week!

749
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,500
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

750
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,700
My beloved racetrack,

751
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,000
all washed away like footprints in sand.

752
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,500
You see Anita there? Hmm?
Look at her.

753
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,500
She's all that's left
of my gaming empire.

754
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,300
And no matter your skills
as a promoter,

755
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,400
you can't organise an ostrich race

756
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,700
with just one ostrich!

757
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,100
Am I right?

758
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,200
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

759
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,100
Yes, sir. Come with me.

760
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,400
Did you know that ostriches
have suicidal tendencies?

761
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,200
Look at this poor thing.

762
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,300
She used to be a grand champion.

763
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,700
Now I have to watch her night and day

764
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,800
to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

765
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,100
So, it occurred to me

766
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,400
the only way to recoup
my tragic losses was to track down

767
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,600
- the two young lovers...
- Sheikh Amar.

768
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
...who cast this dark cloud upon me.

769
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,300
Yes! I'm going to need
the price on your heads!

770
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,800
Your brother will be
very pleased to see...

771
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,600
It's sand dervishes, Persian.

772
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,000
They're common as camel turd
in the desert.

773
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,500
- No, Sheikh Amar, listen to me!
- I'd rather not.

774
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,600
- Nice knife.
- Noble Sheikh,

775
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,400
we are on a sacred journey
to the Temple...

776
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Temple, the Temple.

777
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,100
There's nothing more sacred
than Persian gold!

778
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,200
Give me the dagger.
There are too many of them.

779
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,900
You can't kill them all.
You want to live? Give me the dagger!

780
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,800
Give me the dagger!

781
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,300
Persian, how...

782
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,700
How did you do that?

783
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,400
Instinct.

784
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,300
What?

785
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,800
We have to get out of here.

786
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,900
What happened last night?

787
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Those vipers were controlled
by Hassansins.

788
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,100
Hassansins?

789
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,300
For years, they were the covert
killing force of the Persian kings

790
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,100
until my father
ordered them disbanded.

791
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,600
Nizam must have disobeyed
my father's orders

792
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,000
and kept them intact.

793
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,300
This secret government killing activity,

794
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,100
that's why I don't pay taxes.

795
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,300
We can't stop.

796
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,400
Well, perhaps you can't, but we can.

797
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,300
We could use your help
getting to the Temple.

798
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,500
By crossing the Hindu Kush
with a storm blowing?

799
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,000
You attract trouble
like flies around rotting mango,

800
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,300
- and you're insane...
- There's gold at the Temple.

801
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,700
More than 10 horses can carry.

802
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,600
Tax free.

803
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,400
Sir!

804
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,000
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

805
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,500
I memorised this path as a child.

806
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,300
Every princess must.

807
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,000
It's sacred.

808
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,400
It's here!

809
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,300
The sanctuary.

810
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,800
The one place the dagger
can be hidden safely.

811
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,900
I was expecting
golden statues, waterfalls.

812
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,800
Give me back the dagger
so that I can take it there.

813
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,600
Don't cut yourself, Princess.

814
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,800
Hey! Here!

815
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,800
Not long dead.
Last night maybe. Tortured first.

816
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,700
- Hassansin.
- Nizam knows this place.

817
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,500
All dead.

818
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,500
The entire village. My gold?

819
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,600
Where are you going?

820
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,400
There is only one way to stop all of this.

821
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,300
- What? What?
- To make sure the dagger is safe.

822
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,300
The Temple holds the stone
the dagger came from.

823
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,700
What Temple?
This is a pile of stones and rocks!

824
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,400
The first thing we learned,
if all else fails,

825
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,800
put the dagger back into the stone.

826
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,300
The stone will envelop it.
Pull it into the mountain,

827
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,800
returning it to the gods.

828
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,600
The original promise

829
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,000
must be paid.

830
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,100
What promise?

831
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,800
The gods must take back the life
they spared.

832
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,300
That'll mean you'll die.

833
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,500
Stay there! Stay there!

834
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,800
- Stay there!
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

835
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,400
Give me your sword!

836
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,300
Give me your sword,
or do you forsake even that honour?

837
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,400
There are bodies down there.

838
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,300
Murdered by Hassansins,
on Nizam's order! He's the traitor!

839
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,900
Hassansins no longer exist!

840
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,500
You always thought you were so clever.

841
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,100
- No, this is no trick, Garsiv.
- Sir!

842
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,300
All dead inside, sir. More in the village.

843
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,500
- There's one in there and...
- Stay there!

844
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,000
Nizam wants me dead.

845
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Wants me silenced.
A trial would be too public.

846
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,200
You know this?
He said as much, didn't he?

847
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
I know it hasn't been easy
between us, Garsiv,

848
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,900
but still,

849
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,400
we are brothers.

850
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,500
Touching words with my sword
at your throat.

851
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,300
You often questioned why Father
spent so much time in prayer.

852
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,500
Before he died, he told me
that the bond between brothers

853
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,500
is the sword that defends our empire.

854
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,200
He was praying that
that sword remain strong.

855
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,100
Why would I go into Avrat
for Father's funeral

856
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,900
when I knew it was so dangerous?

857
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,700
Nizam recommended your death.

858
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,500
Tus disagreed,
ordered you brought back alive.

859
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,900
Nizam wants me dead,

860
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,300
and he's hired the Hassansins
to make sure that that does happen.

861
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,000
He's afraid of what I might say

862
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,900
and who I might tell.

863
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,700
Tell me, brother.

864
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Garsiv?

865
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,500
Wait. Garsiv!

866
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,900
Garsiv.

867
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,400
Hassansins!

868
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,700
Shut up! Shut up!

869
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,800
Protect the dagger!

870
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,000
Persian! Behind you!

871
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,100
Tamina!

872
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,400
Tamina!

873
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,300
Forget them! Throw these!

874
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,700
Find her!

875
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,400
Hey! Hey, over here!

876
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,300
You know what they say
about men with big swords?

877
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,300
Tamina! Let me do it.

878
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,600
Only a Guardian can return the dagger.

879
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,300
This isn't something
you can do, Dastan.

880
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,100
I'm ready for this.

881
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,500
I'm not.

882
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,100
Tamina!

883
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,800
Out! Enough! Out!

884
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,300
Garsiv!

885
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,900
Garsiv.

886
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,800
Dastan, I'm sorry.

887
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,600
Save the empire.

888
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,700
Brother.

889
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,800
Brother.

890
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,700
Where is the dagger?

891
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,900
It's gone.

892
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,700
"Protect the dagger,
no matter the consequences."

893
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,700
That was my sacred calling.

894
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,400
That was my destiny.

895
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,000
We make our own destiny, Princess.

896
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,600
We'll get it back.

897
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,300
We're gonna need another horse.

898
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,300
Where will you go?

899
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,100
To Alamut.

900
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,700
Nizam will use that dagger
to pierce the Sandglass,

901
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,200
and he has to be stopped.

902
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,700
"And he has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped."

903
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,900
That's good...

904
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:46,700
What?

905
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,300
A knife thrower with a conscience.

906
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,600
Our friends in the palace say
the Persians have broken through

907
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,400
to the first level of the tunnels.

908
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,100
They'll reach the Sandglass
within hours.

909
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,400
Nizam's keeping the dagger
in the High Temple,

910
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,100
guarded by some sort of demon
covered in spikes.

911
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
The Hassansin that killed my brother.

912
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,200
It's the only thing that stands
between us and the dagger.

913
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,600
No man can stand
within 20 yards of him and live.

914
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,500
Some don't need to get that close.

915
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,100
Spare some water, sire?

916
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,400
You sure about this?

917
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,700
- I owe the boy.
- What?

918
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,900
You're a Ngbaka!
Scourge of the Numidian plain.

919
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,500
Me? I'm a slightly
dishonourable entrepreneur.

920
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,700
This nobility business
is not the cloth we're cut from.

921
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,900
Hurry!

922
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,800
My friend, has anyone ever told you

923
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,900
that you talk too much?

924
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,400
Come on.

925
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,700
Have I told you about the Ngbaka?

926
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,100
Yes, you have.

927
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,900
I hope your brother
listens to you, Persian.

928
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,900
He's here.

929
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,400
Seal every gate!

930
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,900
Find him!

931
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,600
- It's clear.
- Dastan, I don't think...

932
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,200
I don't think you should do this.

933
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,300
Is that concern I hear?

934
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,300
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.

935
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,500
You flatter yourself, Prince.

936
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,500
And you used to be
a better liar, Princess.

937
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,400
Perhaps I'm out of practice.

938
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,900
This won't be the last time
we'll be together.

939
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,500
- Where is the dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats.

940
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,500
Such soft hands.

941
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It's been found, my lord.

942
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,700
The Sandglass?

943
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,500
I don't have the dagger.

944
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,800
Leave me.

945
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,000
Hello, Tus.

946
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,000
Dastan!

947
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,500
- We need to talk.
- Then talk.

948
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,300
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber.

949
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,900
Now!

950
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,300
We are brothers, are we not?

951
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,900
The robe that killed Father
was poisoned by Nizam.

952
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,300
Nizam? You're mad.

953
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,200
Who gave you the robe, Tus?

954
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,200
Who gave you the robe?

955
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,900
You trust him, as did I.

956
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,400
But Alamut wasn't supplying
our enemies with weapons.

957
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,600
Nizam lied to us.

958
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,500
Why would he do such a thing?
What could he gain?

959
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,800
Listen to me carefully.

960
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,400
Beneath the streets of the city
lies an ancient force.

961
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,300
A container holding
the fabled Sands of Time.

962
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,700
Nizam wishes to use it
to corrupt history.

963
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,900
He wants to turn back time
and make himself king.

964
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,900
"Sands of Time"?

965
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,900
- Heresies, Dastan. Pagan madness.
- No.

966
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,300
I've seen its power
with my own eyes, Tus.

967
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,100
And Nizam discovered
its resting place.

968
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,300
If we don't stop him,
our world could end.

969
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,200
If you're going to kill me,

970
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,300
best you do it now.

971
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,500
This is no ordinary dagger.

972
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,200
You press the jewel on its hilt

973
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,600
and you will see.

974
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,500
I should have had the strength
to do this before we invaded the city.

975
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,400
What are you talking about?

976
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,400
To act on what I know is right,

977
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,700
no matter the consequences.

978
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,400
- The soldiers remain on...
- Stay where you are!

979
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,700
He took his own life.

980
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,800
Then God have mercy on the traitor,
for he chose the path of the coward.

981
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,100
We both know
Dastan was many things,

982
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,900
but not a coward.

983
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,200
"This is no ordinary dagger.

984
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,500
"Press the jewel on its hilt
and you will see."

985
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,200
...no matter the consequences.

986
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,400
Stop!

987
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,400
A moment ago
you died before my eyes.

988
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,800
You pressed it.

989
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,300
How did you know I would?

990
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,300
Because we are brothers.

991
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,200
On the day we left for war,

992
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,800
our father told me a true king
considers the advice of counsel,

993
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,700
but always listens to his heart.

994
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,100
You shouldn't have had to go so far
for me to believe you.

995
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,600
Your Majesty,
the soldiers tell me that...

996
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,500
I see that Dastan has indeed returned.

997
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,000
Tus, remember what I told you!

998
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,200
No! A moment.

999
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,800
Poor Tus. So eager for the crown.

1000
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,500
And you, Dastan, always charging in.

1001
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,300
So desperate to prove

1002
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:38,100
you're more than something
the King scraped off the streets.

1003
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,500
What a glorious mess we are.

1004
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,400
It seems the bond between brothers

1005
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,700
is no longer the sword
that defends our empire.

1006
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,900
Yes!

1007
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,100
He was one of us.

1008
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,100
He was a priest of the Temple.

1009
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,700
That's how Nizam discovered
the existence of the Sandglass.

1010
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,500
They've corrupted the Guardians.
Infected us.

1011
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,900
We're no longer pure.

1012
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,000
We must hurry.

1013
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,300
Pulley.

1014
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,800
The pulley!

1015
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,200
Now!

1016
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,700
The Guardians built passageways
underneath the city

1017
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,400
as secret access to the Sandglass.

1018
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,200
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

1019
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,400
That will lead us down
to the Sandglass chamber.

1020
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,700
There is only one safe path.

1021
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,100
Faster!

1022
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,200
Follow in my footsteps.

1023
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,600
Nothing can touch the surface
other than where I step.

1024
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,300
Run, Dastan!

1025
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,100
Run!

1026
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,900
Dastan!

1027
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,600
Nizam!

1028
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,700
You murdered your own family.

1029
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,200
Sharaman was your brother!

1030
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:13,800
And my curse.

1031
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,000
I looked up to you.

1032
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,400
Dastan!

1033
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,300
I never understood why my brother
brought trash into the palace.

1034
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,500
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.

1035
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,800
It's where you'll stay under my reign.

1036
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,600
Tamina!

1037
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,300
Nizam! Don't use the dagger
to undo your past!

1038
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,500
- It will unleash...
- Unleash what?

1039
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,700
God's wrath? Hell itself?

1040
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,900
Don't do this!

1041
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,100
Stop him! If the glass shatters,
the world dies with it.

1042
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:21,100
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.

1043
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,900
- Let me go.
- I won't.

1044
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,400
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!

1045
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,300
I wish we could have been together.

1046
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,600
No!

1047
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,400
No! No!

1048
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,500
- Dastan!
- No!

1049
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,900
Tamina! No!

1050
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,500
No!

1051
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,000
No!

1052
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,600
Dastan!

1053
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,900
Tamina!

1054
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,600
Family.

1055
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:28,600
Prince Dastan!

1056
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,300
Prince Dastan!

1057
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,800
Bis? You're here!

1058
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,200
Of course I'm here.

1059
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,900
Our men have surrounded
Alamut's palace.

1060
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,500
The battle is over.

1061
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,100
Not yet.

1062
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,300
Wait!

1063
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,100
Wait!

1064
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,500
Wait.

1065
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,300
Brave soldiers of Persia,

1066
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:07,400
we have been deceived
into attacking this holy city!

1067
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:11,300
Alamut has no weapon forges!

1068
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,400
Dastan!

1069
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,600
Have you gone mad?

1070
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:19,000
I cannot stand silent in the face
of treachery. This war was set up

1071
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,300
by one trusted above all else,

1072
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,900
our Uncle Nizam!

1073
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,800
Dastan has fought hard today,

1074
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,100
perhaps too hard!

1075
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,900
What he needs now is to get out
from under this burning sun to rest,

1076
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,200
gather his wits!

1077
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,900
The weapons we found are forgeries!

1078
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,000
There are no weapons here, Uncle,
and you know it!

1079
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,200
And the spy who supposedly
intercepted them was hired by you

1080
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,100
to persuade all of us to invade Alamut!

1081
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,800
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?

1082
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,900
You yourself led the attack!
Brought us this great triumph!

1083
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,900
I should never have
let the attack happen.

1084
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,700
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

1085
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,800
It will never be you.

1086
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,200
You will never be king.

1087
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,300
You don't have the heart.

1088
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,200
You will die in the shadow
of a great man.

1089
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:18,200
Get him down from there before he
makes an even bigger fool of himself!

1090
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,400
Tus! Before you left Nasaf,
Father told you this,

1091
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,300
that a true king
considers the advice of counsel,

1092
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,100
but he always listens to his own heart.

1093
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,000
Father and I were alone.

1094
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,500
- How could you know that?
- He was right.

1095
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,300
He knows us,
and he knows what we're capable of.

1096
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:37,200
- Just listen to your heart.
- He defies your order

1097
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,100
in the attack
and now wants to turn back.

1098
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,700
Tus.

1099
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,300
Take measure here.

1100
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,400
The spy knows the truth.

1101
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,900
Find the spy! Bring him to me!

1102
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,100
We'll wring it from him!

1103
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,100
You had what every man
could ever dream of.

1104
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,900
Love, respect, and family.

1105
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:47,300
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?

1106
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,600
Princess of Alamut,

1107
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,300
I was misled to attack your city.

1108
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,900
Forgive me, Highness.
Let me try to make amends.

1109
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:44,200
It would be to our mutual advantage

1110
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:48,200
that our nations be united
by a bond stronger than friendship.

1111
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,000
Marriage.

1112
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:56,300
Your marriage, to one who is both
conqueror and saviour of your city.

1113
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,400
Dastan.

1114
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,400
Royal blood or not,
he's every bit a son to our father.

1115
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,700
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

1116
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,300
A true prince of Persia.

1117
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,700
Get up there before I take your place.

1118
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,600
Hello, Princess.

1119
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:32,700
It is customary to accompany
a proposal with gifts,

1120
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:36,100
but I was surprised,
and, alas, I'm unprepared.

1121
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,100
I have nothing for you,

1122
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:43,700
save that which was already yours.

1123
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,600
Walk with me, Prince Dastan.

1124
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,400
How can I trust the man
that breached the walls of my city?

1125
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,300
I'm starting to think I'm no longer the
same man who breached those walls.

1126
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,300
That's a short time for a man
to change so much.

1127
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,600
Perhaps.

1128
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,700
It sounds as if
you've discovered something here.

1129
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:25,500
What might that be?

1130
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,600
A new spiritual awareness.

1131
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,300
- A destiny?
- Yes, exactly.

1132
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,700
But I believe we make
our own destiny, Princess.

1133
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,700
You have an unfortunate
lack of curiosity.

1134
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,600
No doubt one of my many flaws.

1135
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,700
Please don't mock me, Prince.

1136
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,900
Oh, I hardly think we know each other
well enough for that, Princess.

1137
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,000
But I look forward

1138
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,000
to the day that we do.
