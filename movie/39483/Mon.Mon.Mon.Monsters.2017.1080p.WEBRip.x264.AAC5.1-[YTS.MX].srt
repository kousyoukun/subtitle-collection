Mon Mon Mon Monsters

4
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,625
Where's the money

5
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,041
Staright A's doesn't mean you can steal

6
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Good skill

7
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,875
Smarty pants my ass

8
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,166
Ｗatch out for me

9
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,916
Ｗatch out for me

10
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,250
Ｗatch out for me

11
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,208
Ms. Li, please don't expel Lin

12
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,750
Everyone makes mistakes

13
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,666
The important thing is to repent

14
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,708
So let's make him sing a song

15
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,208
Don't look at me

16
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,375
Where's the money?

17
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,208
Ms. Li, I didn't steal it

18
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,375
If you didn't do it

19
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,958
Why is this envelope in your backpack?

20
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,375
I seriously don't know, I didn't do it

21
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,083
Ms. Li, I know

22
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,416
The money must be...

23
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,416
In his shoes

24
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,875
Yes! In his shoes

25
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,125
Take them off

26
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,208
Shoes off

27
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,708
This is your only chance to clear your name

28
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,958
So take off your shoes, quickly

29
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,125
I got it

30
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,458
The money must be in his anus

31
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:46,750
Pants off

32
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,875
Lin is ridiculous. What a fraud

33
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,500
I don't want to sit next to him

34
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,708
Impressive. What a thief

35
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,166
Lin is in this chat group, right?

36
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,791
Hi thief

37
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,250
Anus wunderkind

38
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:11,916
Kick him out

39
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:12,666
Kick him out

40
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,250
Kick him out

41
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,166
I know you didn't steal the money

42
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Everyone

43
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,000
was just

44
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,375
messing with you

45
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,083
Shut up

46
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,375
Who asked you to talk

47
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,500
I just

48
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,250
Hope you don't turn out like me

49
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,750
Piss off!

50
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,708
No one will be like you

51
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,625
Get out!

52
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,041
Fuck off!

53
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,458
Boss, look

54
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,916
Thief

55
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,625
What are you doing here?

56
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,708
You guys are just ridiculous

57
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,333
If the school finds out

58
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,166
All of you will be expelled

59
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,583
The pool has been abandoned for decades

60
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,000
One man's trash, another man's treasure

61
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,458
Why did you guys steal the class fees?

62
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,291
When exactly did you see us steal it?

63
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,666
I knew it

64
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,291
You knew?

65
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,416
You must be a psychic aren't you

66
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,583
Aren't you?

67
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,833
I don't care if you guys steal

68
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,708
Why frame me?

69
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,083
Framed you?

70
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,375
What about now?

71
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,416
What a pervert, Lin

72
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,250
You're a thief and a boobies lover

73
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,375
I'm not

74
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,333
GOT CHA

75
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,416
Hang in there

76
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,666
Don't die on us, Lin

77
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,208
You know why we steal the money?

78
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,000
Cause I want to tune my bike

79
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,666
And I want to gas it up

80
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,958
You only think of yourself

81
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,750
If we didn't steal the money

82
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,041
We couldn't prank you

83
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,375
And you wouldn't be able
to touch my girl's boobs

84
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,833
What a shame

85
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,750
Lin

86
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,958
Hear me out

87
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,958
No one comes here since
they say it's spooked

88
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,125
But we've been smoking here for 2 years

89
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,583
I can't see no fucking ghosts here

90
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,916
Can I bury you alive here later?

91
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,416
If you can

92
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,666
Come haunt me as a ghost

93
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,375
Please do your best

94
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,125
You have to turn into a ghost and find me

95
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,541
I freaking want to see a ghost

96
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,583
Dying to see one

97
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,833
Please turn into a ghost

98
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,208
Come haunt my ass

99
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,833
Oh you know what?

100
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,375
Just turn into a Pokemon ghost

101
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,416
I'll get your ass again in my phone

102
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,416
Find out how high your CP is

103
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,041
I don't know
what happened between you guys

104
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,333
But something must've happened

105
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,041
Now that your snitching behind their backs

106
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,333
If your classmates find out

107
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,791
They will be very unhappy

108
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,291
Have you ever thought about that?

109
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,791
This is how karma works

110
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,000
But I didn't do anything wrong

111
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:24,375
Lin, in addition to studying at school

112
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,583
Relationships are important too

113
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,416
I know it's difficult

114
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,083
But have you ever wondered

115
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,333
Why it's you instead of someone else?

116
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,916
But they almost poked my eye out

117
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,458
Stop looking

118
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,125
Look at your test sheet

119
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,875
What are you looking at?

120
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,958
Start looking at your books

121
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,291
You said you didn't steal the money

122
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,375
Then do you have proof that they stole it?

123
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,833
This is a recording without video

124
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,791
Maybe you were the one to hit them first

125
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe you appeared to be taunting them

126
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,500
I think they deserve a chance
to explain themselves

127
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,291
Or would you like to seize this opportunity to

128
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,500
make things better with them?

131
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,333
After Lin stole the class fees last time

132
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,500
He has been self-reflecting

133
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,291
So I would like to give him a chance
to redeem himself

134
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,250
Anyone want to help him complete

135
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,208
community service assignment?

141
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,250
Complete this assignment with him

142
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,875
I think it will be extra meaningful

143
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,958
Far out! Ms. Li

144
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,750
How do you know I'm so kind-hearted?

145
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,250

-What the hell -Let me do it

157
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,541
Uh-uh

158
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,958
Won't you all have bad karma for doing this?

159
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,000
We're going to be old too

160
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,916
We just have to die before we're old

161
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:02,708

00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,958
Stop it

00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,208
Keys

196
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,666
Where are the keys? Old man

197
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,833
Keys

198
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,708
Where are they?

199
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,916
Give me the keys...

200
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,000
I think that safe must have bars of gold

201
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,875
Let's steal it

202
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,916
But it has a thick chain

203
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,166
I have hydraulic shears

204
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,541
Hydraulic shears to chop off your penis

205
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,791
Do you have a welding torch?

206
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
I have to check

207
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,791
Let's assmeble at 1:30 am

208
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,916
Let's make it 2, right here

209
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,916
Bring the stuff

210
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,708
Okay

211
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,541
What for?

212
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,083
Just shut up and come

213
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,250
You talk too much

214
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,708
Keep your mouth shut

215
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,916
2 am

216
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,625
What was that?

217
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,791
Dogs

218
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,625
You sure?

219
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,083
Yes, shut up

220
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,291
Boss

221
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,208
I really want to fart

222
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,041
Shut the fuck up

223
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,083
Guo-feng

224
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,000
I told you to bring hydraulic shears

225
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
What's with the shovel?

226
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,416
Digging your own grave?

227
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,916
Might come in handy

228
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,666
Lin

229
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,791
Didn't you say you had a welding torch?

230
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,875
I said that I had to look around

231
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,583
Idiot

232
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,166
I gave you a chance to step up and be a pal

233
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,416
I got it

234
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,375
A blowtorch

235
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,625
I was just going to say...

236
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,541
That's a blowlamp for barbeques

237
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,958
Isn't it a welding torch?

238
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,125
How did I end up with you three idiots

239
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:55,875
Wait up

240
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,833
What's up

241
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,791
What?

242
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,875
Go

243
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,791
Hurry

244
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,500
Fuck! Old fart

245
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,333
Never mind him! Move

246
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,041
Boobies-lover, watch the door

247
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,333
Watch the door

248
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,625
Move your ass

249
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:04,750
C'mon, let's go

250
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,750
Boss, want me to burn
it with the welding torch?

251
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,958
That's a blowlamp for barbeques
not a welding torch

252
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,083
What the hell?

253
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,500
Idiot, let me do it

254
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,250
Keep it down

255
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,250
Don't take pictures

256
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,958
What if we get a ghost on photo?

257
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:35,750
We won't

258
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,708
Boss, don't saw it open

259
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,958
Saw it right here

260
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,375
Hurry up

261
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,500
Li Rong-feng

262
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,250
Dumbass

263
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,083
Have an orange

264
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,250
You old fart

265
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,500
Come to the orange

266
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,875
Here, eat your orange

267
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,916
Come here

268
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,333
Have an orange

269
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,791
C'mon, have an orange

270
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,791
Li Rong-feng

271
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,333
You sure there's gold in here? It's real heavy

272
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,166
Let's settle things later

273
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,708
It'll suck if those aren't gold bars

274
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,250
Shut the fuck up

275
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,458
Should we split the earnings by 3 or 4?

276
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,375
I told you we'll talk later

277
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,583
By 4! I'm part of this too

278
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,541
Quiet we'll settle things later

279
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,250
Wait a sec

280
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,166
What is it

281
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,750
Did you hear that?

282
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,833
It's the sound of

283
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,333
my heart beat

284
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,291
-WTF -You retard

285
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,916
Wait a sec

286
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,250
Now what

287
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,375
I heard something

288
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,708
What

289
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,125
Run

290
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,041
Why is it still on?

291
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,958
I can't mute this shit

292
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,000
Switch hands

293
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,333
It's really heavy

294
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,583
Switch

295
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,250
Fuck! What the hell?

296
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,083
This is a kid, right?

297
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,124
Should we call the cops?

298
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,333
Idiot we're not calling the cops

299
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,999
What do we do?

300
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:44,833
Let's get out of here

301
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,083
Let's bounce

302
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,749
We can't

303
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,374
Fuck

304
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:29,458
Boss

305
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:31,958
Should we electrocute it?

306
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,499
Electrocute with what exactly?

307
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,499
You really are an idiot aren't you?

308
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,624
Hey boss

309
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,416
What the hell are we doing?

310
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:42,874
Why did we bring this thing here?

311
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,208
Idiot

312
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:46,291
If we left it there

313
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,416
The cops would bust
us using the security footage

314
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:53,499
If it dies, we bury the body

315
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,374
We didn't kill it anyways

316
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,791
You are right

317
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,124
But that swing of yours

318
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,624
What swing?

319
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,416
Do you want to get hit by a car?

320
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,541
I can dig one hole here

321
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:09,708
And I can dig two

322
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,333
Did you see that?

323
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,499
See what?

324
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,624
I think it's afraid of light

325
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:44,291
Yeah! Lights

326
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:45,291
Afraid of light

327
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,624
What?

328
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:57,291
Our Father! Show your powers!

329
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:58,583
Fuck. For real?

330
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,291
Give me that

331
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:46,791
Life doesn't have to be that long

332
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,833
Class, you may nap as long as you want

333
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:52,624
Napping is good

334
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,083
Napping is great

335
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:01,208
Anyone wants
to know the answer to this question?

336
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,999
You want to know?
Are you messing with me?

337
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,083
All you do is sleep in class

338
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,624
What are you really up to?

339
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,083
I give up

340
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,124
This is what you call a kidnap

341
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,541
Bingo! It is a kidnap!

342
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,708
Kidnapping

343
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,124
But boss, she doesn't look hungry

344
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,541
Idiot, can't you see

345
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,791
She eats humans, not lunch boxes

346
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:45,999
Humans

347
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,124
Wei-zhu

348
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,874
You guys are sick

349
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,291
Why capture this thing?

350
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,999
Owning a monster is awesome

351
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:25,749
It's not a human being

352
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,833
We do whatever we want

353
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,249
But how long will we keep it locked up here?

354
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:31,833
Until

355
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:35,249
I know what to do with it

356
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,624
Don't be afraid

357
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,833
They'll let you go once they're finished

358
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,124
Boobies-lover, are you ready?

359
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,416
Quickly

360
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,083
Hold on

361
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:10,583
Here, let's give you an upgrade

362
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,541
You're more used to be bullied, aren't you?

363
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,249
Hang on

364
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:06,749
Fuck

365
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:08,416
That's some dark blood

366
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,083
Will it grow back if we yank it?

367
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,291
Monsters' bodies can regenerate all the time

368
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:13,291
Like in the movies

369
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:14,624
If it grows back

370
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,249
We'll yank it again

371
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,291
And again

372
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,583
And

373
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,666
AGAIN

374
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,291
Quick, give me a bottle

375
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,499
I'm going to use them as beads

376
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,541
Do whatever you like with it

377
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:10,499
The Wall that rises, the sands that flow

378
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:18,666
Are what help me grow

379
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:24,874
Though the road is long

380
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:29,291
All I do is go

381
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:39,374
I'm just a Chinese camel

382
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,833
Broadswords

383
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,333
29th Army

384
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,124
Squad leader

385
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:55,124
765

386
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,291
Li Rong-feng

387
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,541
Foul beast

388
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,583
Name and rank

389
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,249
Jesus Chris

390
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,208
People have gone missing

391
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,333
They say this place is haunted!

392
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,624
Haunted!

393
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,208
You old vet, why are you still awake?

394
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,624
Singing some dead-old song

395
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,958
Talking about camels

396
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,708
Camels! What about camels?

397
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,249
Go to the fucking zoo

398
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,166
Where are your morals?

399
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:53,999
Who the heck you want to scare

400
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,249
with that big old knife

401
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,833
You old prick with Alzheimer's

402
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,541
Give us a break will you?

403
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:30,416
Heaven and Earth

404
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:35,166
Doesn't work

405
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,416
If a man find a damsel

406
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:39,916
That is a virgin

407
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:41,749
Which is not betrothed

408
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,541
and lay hold on her, and lie with her...

409
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:49,708
He that is wounded in the stones

410
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,624
or hath his privy member cut off

411
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,333
Shall not enter into
the congregation of the LORD

412
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,249
You suck

413
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,666
It's not afraid of silver
the bible or my middle finger

414
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:09,416
It's not an vampire

415
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:10,541
It isn't a zombie

416
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,208
It isn't human, either

417
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,041
You should thank this thing

418
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:17,249
Why's that?

419
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,708
If we didn't capture it

420
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,833
You would be up there

421
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,249
Me? But it's tied in scripture

422
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,916
You'll be tied in pornos, right?

423
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:27,208
Anyways, if it were you instead of it

424
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,916
I'll definitely be more creative

425
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,666
C'mon show your appreciation

426
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,499
Thank you

427
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,916
Fuck! For real?

428
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:44,333
We caught it together

429
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,583
You have 1/4 of the shares

430
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:49,416
I mean 1/5

431
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:16,833
Let me see

432
00:40:20,874 --> 00:40:22,374
Why can't I see any red blood cells

433
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:23,624
That's because

434
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,249
There aren't any red blood cells

435
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:33,749
Those black dots

436
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,708
look like eggs

437
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:35,666
Eggs?

438
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:36,958
Eggs or spores perhaps

439
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,083
What are these?

440
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,958

What are you trying to say?

450
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:34,541
It's a girl!

451
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,458
What was this thing before

452
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,583
I don't know

453
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,708
But now

454
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:39,958
She's a monster

455
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,916
Boss, does this make us more cruel
than Cersei Lannister?

456
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:47,083
Who's Cersei Lannister?

457
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,458
The queen who killed her sons

458
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:51,833
Which son?

459
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:54,291
All of them

460
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:13,541
So why did we capture her?

461
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,916
Don't know if those Yankees at NASA
are into this stuff

462
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:19,624
Or are they just into ETs

463
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,208
Please! We're only high schoolers

464
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,666
We can' t be the only ones
who caught a monster like this

465
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:26,374
There must be plenty in America

466
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:27,624
Who knows

467
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:31,666
If boobies-lover's research is real

468
00:43:31,749 --> 00:43:33,749
It's a Chinese monster

469
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,124
Poisoned by voodoos

470
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,541
FBI might not have any

471
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:38,041
So we should sell it to the FBI

472
00:43:38,124 --> 00:43:39,458
We can't sell it, okay?

473
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,458
Why are we doing this?

474
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,249
Eventually she'll starve to death

475
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:49,291
True, if she doesn't eat any humans

476
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:50,583
She will die soon

477
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,458
Then who will we feed her

478
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:54,333
Yeah, who?

479
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,791
Yeah, who should be the one?

480
00:43:56,874 --> 00:43:58,124
Let's vote and see

481
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,249
Okay, voting sounds good

482
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,624
Very democratic

483
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:02,791
Fine

484
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,666
Hello students

485
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:34,541
This is nurse Angela

486
00:44:34,624 --> 00:44:37,624
Today,let's learn how to draw blood

487
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:41,708
Where is this from?

488
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,541
It looks so dodgy

489
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:45,374
Was it home-made?

490
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,749
It looks fine

491
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,458
This has the highest views

492
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:49,458
Totally trust-worthy

493
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:50,874
Why do I have to feed her?

494
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,458
Because you're the most caring person

495
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:58,041
Unless you want to see her starve to death

496
00:44:58,624 --> 00:44:59,999
With that much blood in you

497
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,291
Draw some out is healthy

498
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:02,208
Exactly

499
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:03,249
I read on the internet

500
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,499
People who donate blood
have better metabolism

501
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,624
If you want to treat her well

502
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,291
Then take action

503
00:45:19,374 --> 00:45:20,708
Stop moving

504
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,041
I didn't move

505
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,624
Don't move, I'm aiming

506
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,291
I didn't move

507
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,791
Stay still, or you do it yourself

508
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:38,166
Fine, I'll do it myself

509
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:40,249
No! Let me do it

510
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,583
I've always wanted to be Doctor Black Jack

511
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,583
No! Let me do it

512
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,583
I've never been afraid of blood

513
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:50,833
No! Please let me do it

514
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,124
I've never been able to do anything right

515
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,124
Please give me this chance

516
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,916
Let me

517
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:58,416
Move it

518
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,541
I'm developing my hobby

519
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,333
Lunch Time

520
00:47:52,249 --> 00:47:53,708
Drink slowly now

521
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,124
I feel dizzy

522
00:47:58,124 --> 00:48:00,416
If we find another voodoo master

523
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,499
or some person that knows magic

524
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:06,874
Can we get the voodoo out from you?

525
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:09,124
Or is it too late

526
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:13,124
for you to become human again?

527
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,458
What are you doing?

528
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,458
I understand how pitiful all of this is

529
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:00,666
But if I just let you go

530
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:02,458
They will kill me

531
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:04,874
They really will kill me

532
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:07,791
You've seen what they can do

533
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,458
But be patient

534
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:31,041
I'll think of a way to get you out

535
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,166
You know

536
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,916
I am helping you, right?

537
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:46,833
I'm not them

538
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:49,166
We're different

539
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:55,999
I'm not like them

540
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,916
What's this?

541
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:17,374
Blue

542
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,708
Blue, how much is it?

543
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:21,166
One thousand dollars

544
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:22,541
Don't take it

545
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,624
Don't take it

546
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:26,208
Tell the customers that there's no change

547
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,708
No change

548
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,124
Yes, no change, don't take it, remember that

549
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,583
This one here

550
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:38,958
One hundred dollars

551
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,874
Stop playing with that. Focus

552
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:42,624
I know what to do

553
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:46,333
If you see the red one just take it

554
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:49,749
Tell them to find change themselves

555
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,208
Let them find change themselves

556
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,999
I'll find change

557
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,708
Take what? What will you do with it?

558
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:55,916
Tell them to take it themselves

559
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:58,874
I know what to do

560
00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:05,749
Put that back

561
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:06,916
Or pay for it

562
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:08,708
Go away

563
00:51:09,374 --> 00:51:10,416
Put it back

564
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,208
Stand up

565
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:45,583
Attention

566
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:47,958
Bow

567
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:50,999
Good morning, Ms.Li

568
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,041
Sit down

569
00:51:56,916 --> 00:51:57,624
Okay

570
00:51:57,708 --> 00:51:58,916
Quiet down

571
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,624
Ren-hao

572
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:42,416
Yes, Ms. Li

573
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,583
You beat my son this badly

574
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,291
Where are your parents?

575
00:52:51,374 --> 00:52:53,166
Apologize now

576
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:54,583
Apologize for what?

577
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:57,166
How will you pay for my son's injuries?

578
00:52:57,249 --> 00:52:58,208
Ren-hao

579
00:52:58,291 --> 00:52:59,791
You're just a piece of shit

580
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:01,333
Tell your parents to
take responsibility for this

581
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,541
Ren-hao, I don't know

582
00:53:03,624 --> 00:53:06,541
what has gotten into you recently?

583
00:53:06,624 --> 00:53:07,958
But that's okay

584
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,624
It's probably tests from Gods

585
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,249
Here, let me help you

586
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:13,916
Hands together

587
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:19,624
Namo Amoghasiddhi

588
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:22,083
Namo Amoghasiddhi

589
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,624
Samantabhadra

590
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,666
Samantabhadra

591
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:28,041
Bhaishajyaguru

592
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:30,666
Bhaishajyaguru

593
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,958
Amitabha

594
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:36,666
I know that's Buddha

595
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,541
Watch over disciple Ren-hao

596
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:43,791
Watch over disciple Ren-hao

597
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,833
To rid the karma from this life and the past

598
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:49,916
To rid thousands and Millions of Kalpa

599
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:52,041
You're funny, Ms. Li

600
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:55,166
Don't disrespect Buddha

601
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:02,958
You disrespect the Venerates
and Buddha now

602
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,916
You will go to hell tongue-less

603
00:54:04,999 --> 00:54:06,291
Which hell?

604
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,374
Tounge-less in hell

605
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,541
Stop joking

606
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:11,541
Stand straight

607
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,166
So disrespectful

608
00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:15,541
Gautama Buddha

609
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:16,833
Sounds impressive

610
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:18,624
Samantabhadra

611
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,374
Samanta~

612
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,958
Bhaishajyaguru

613
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:23,208
Bhaisha~

614
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,333
Stop with the jokes

615
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:26,749
Stop giggling and stand upright

616
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:29,499
Samantabhadra

617
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,708
Bhaishajyaguru

618
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:34,541
Repeat after me

619
00:54:34,624 --> 00:54:35,999
I told you to repeat after me

620
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,374
Repeat after me

621
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:40,166
Did you hear me? Samantabhadra

622
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:42,541
You better take me seriously

623
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:44,916
Ren-hao

624
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,999
Tell your dad to meet me tomorrow

625
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:49,374
I'm going to question him

626
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,999
How he taught a son like this

627
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,458
Who doesn't respect his teachers

628
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:54,583
With no respect of himself

629
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,416
You piece of crap

630
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:56,958
Say that again

631
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:14,916
Ren-hao

632
00:55:15,624 --> 00:55:17,624
I suddenly remembered something

633
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,833
I should apologize to you

634
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:24,166
It's my bad

635
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,999
Your father can't come
to school tomorrow, yes?

636
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,208
Here's the thing

637
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,833
It's written in his family information

638
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,874
His father is still serving time in prison

639
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,291
I forgot what he was charged with

640
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:50,999
Drug abuse or robbery?

641
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:54,624
Or both?

642
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:02,041
You really can't blame Ren-hao

643
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:05,374
For becoming a scum like this

644
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:07,083
It's because of his father

645
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:10,416
is also a crime-committing social scum

646
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,374
If you really think about it

647
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,958
Maybe he is not his biological father

648
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,958
It's hard to say

649
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,083
Because his mother's occupation is “special”

650
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,291
Which one of those druggies

651
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:25,791
made her mother pregnant

652
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:27,749
No one really knows for sure

653
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,749
Ren-hao wasn't taught any manners

654
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:34,041
He is

655
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,749
Manner-less

656
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,666
Fuck

657
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:45,874
Bitch

658
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:46,791
I'm gonna

659
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:47,916
fucking

660
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:49,874
kill you

661
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:56,583
Fuck

662
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,624
Why does everyone have to pour some?

663
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,708
Just asking

664
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,083
What's gonna happen?

665
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,791
Idiot, we won't find out unless we pour it in

666
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,624
That's why we're pouring it in

667
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:35,041
Don't you want to be a pioneer?

668
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:37,541
Then let's try it with something else

669
00:58:37,624 --> 00:58:39,208
How about we experiment with you?

670
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:44,999
Is it going to be like the movies?

671
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:48,749
If she drinks the monster's blood, she'll...

672
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,416
She'll what?

673
00:58:50,499 --> 00:58:51,999
Turn into a monster

674
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,499
She better turn into a monster

675
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,499
Pei-fen, let's go catch a movie after work

676
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,083
There's a really spicy movie in theaters now

677
00:59:48,374 --> 00:59:50,124
You mean "special"

678
00:59:51,416 --> 00:59:54,874
Yeah, it's a really special movie

679
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,749
The movie's basically about falling in love

680
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:02,499
Boss

681
01:00:06,999 --> 01:00:08,374
I wanted to

682
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:10,374
thank you

683
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:12,291
For what?

684
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,874
For backing me up

685
01:00:15,624 --> 01:00:19,624
Relax, from this day forward,
only I can beat you

686
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:20,958
I'll beat up

687
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,666
whoever hit you

688
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:31,166
Why beat me then?

689
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:33,999
What for?

690
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,499
Because it's fun

691
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:45,916
It's got the coolest zombies

692
01:00:45,999 --> 01:00:48,624
Werewolves and vampires

693
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:52,583
I'm going to a monastery

694
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,999
That way we can worship the gods together

695
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,083
And then go to the movies

696
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,458
You don't worship at a monastery

697
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,916
You meditate

698
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:07,583
Recently when I talked to that
group of students

699
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,291
I almost lost control of them

700
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,583
What a bunch of unspiritual kids

701
01:01:14,874 --> 01:01:17,624
Do you think I should go meditate with you?

702
01:01:18,874 --> 01:01:20,708
Let me take you to the health center

703
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:21,874
Thank you

704
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:25,749
Jackpot

705
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,916
Send her to the health center

706
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:46,624
Get a close up of this

707
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,624
Ms. Li

708
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:01,291
Ms. Li

709
01:02:03,374 --> 01:02:05,249
Buddha

710
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,708
is my BFF

711
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:46,124
What are you all doing?

712
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,416
Help her

713
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:49,083
Help her

714
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,166
Calm down everyone

715
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:52,124
Help her

716
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:59,749
HELP HER

717
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,291
What you are seeing now

718
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:04,541
is an incident at
Tung-Shih Senior High School

719
01:03:04,624 --> 01:03:07,458
A teacher spontaneously combusted

720
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:09,791
and began massive bleeding

721
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:11,583
during a school basketball game

722
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:14,833
she then shortly burned to death

723
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,166
The cause of the fire has yet to be confirmed

724
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:19,749
Worth noting that all the student witnesses…

725
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,874
What happens when we add some

726
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:56,708
She better turns into a monster

727
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,791
In the end

728
01:03:57,874 --> 01:03:58,708
We'll turn whoever

729
01:03:58,791 --> 01:03:59,499
we want

730
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:00,833
into monsters

731
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:01,916
Capture them all

732
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:03,583
And pull their teeth out

733
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:16,874
Shu-wei

734
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,291
You're finally here

735
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:24,583
To Ms. Li who turned to Burning man

736
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:25,791
Burning man

737
01:04:30,624 --> 01:04:31,374
Why won't you drink

738
01:04:33,124 --> 01:04:34,458
I don't like drinking

739
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:36,041
Didn't you drink some last Halloween?

740
01:04:36,124 --> 01:04:38,583
I don't like drinking from cans

741
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,791
I like the bottled kind

742
01:04:41,874 --> 01:04:43,499
You want a bottle?

743
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:47,124
I have a bottle right here

744
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,916
I mean

745
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:49,833
Bottled red wine

746
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:52,041
Here, I got a bottle red wine

747
01:04:52,124 --> 01:04:53,624
There's a bottle

748
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:54,999
right here

749
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:57,249
Just a bit left

750
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,291
Drink up

751
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:01,833
I can't, my parents will kill me if they find out

752
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:03,791
Brush your teeth then

753
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:05,708
What? I didn't bring my toothbrush

754
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,166
There's one in the bathroom

755
01:05:07,249 --> 01:05:08,208
There is toothbrush?

756
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:09,833
It's classy

757
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,249
I don't have any toothpaste

758
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:16,374
Wait, you want Darlie or Sensodyne?

759
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:23,874
I don't use any of these

760
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,291
Are you going to drink or what

761
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,583
You think I'm going to burn you up?

762
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:09,541
I can kill you with a million ways

763
01:06:09,624 --> 01:06:11,166
Why poison you?

764
01:06:16,874 --> 01:06:18,791
Why bring him into all this?

765
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,499
I don't get it

766
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:25,208
Probably because I have blood

767
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:30,749
I didn't force you to provide blood

768
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,541
I'd be happy

769
01:06:32,624 --> 01:06:33,999
He'd be happy

770
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,208
to watch her starve to death

771
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,958
You're the one that said no

772
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:41,916
What you looking at?

773
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:44,291
If you want to let her go, do it then

774
01:06:44,374 --> 01:06:46,749
Let her go and let her eat you up

775
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:49,166
You want to be the good guy

776
01:06:49,249 --> 01:06:51,583
You don't have the guts

777
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:53,374
What are you then?

778
01:07:33,874 --> 01:07:35,583
Find change yourself

779
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:42,124
100 dollars. Find change yourself

780
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:10,916
100 dollars

781
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:13,666
Don't you know I'm scamming you?

782
01:08:13,749 --> 01:08:16,041
Don't you know I'm scamming you?

783
01:08:16,124 --> 01:08:18,666
Why do you believe in people so easily?

784
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:20,874
Let me tell you

785
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,958
There are no good people here,
only bad people

786
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:27,041
Or retards like you

787
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:38,874
-100 dollars -You

788
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:41,708
You retard, don't you understand

789
01:08:41,791 --> 01:08:44,208
100 dollars find change yourself

790
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,083
Don't you understand

791
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,833
Find change yourself

792
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,749
100 dollars

793
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:50,624
You retard

794
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:57,874
100 dollars, find change yourself

795
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:00,499
The money's on the floor

796
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:28,249
I heard dogs chewed out this body all night

797
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:42,083
This is the seventh time this month

798
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,333
You guys always talk about another monster

799
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:45,916
She probably saw the news

800
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:47,333
and found out her partner's missing

801
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:49,249
Thinks one of the school's students did it

802
01:10:49,874 --> 01:10:51,541
So what?

803
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,416
The monster doesn't know who exactly

804
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,249
kidnapped her companion

805
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,874
Am I right?

806
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:01,541
Okay

807
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:02,666
Have you guys had enough?

808
01:11:02,749 --> 01:11:04,499
Burn her up already

809
01:11:05,999 --> 01:11:07,583
Boobies-lover has a lot of blood

810
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:09,999
We'll burn her when he is out of blood

811
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:16,708
(Multiple Tong-Shih High School
Students Dismembered)

812
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:20,416
(Suspect Still At Bay)

813
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:44,333
I'm the one who sent you the note
at cram school

814
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:49,499
You said don't jerk-off in class

815
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,083
I was very pissed

816
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:57,499
Because I really was jerking off

817
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:06,499
But I swear I didn't finish

818
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,541
Because it would smell

819
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:14,124
I'm not a pervert after all

820
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,083
Because I love you

821
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:34,624
What do you want to drink?

822
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,624
I want a cup of watermelon juice

823
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:40,874
Extra large

824
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,333
What the fuck?

825
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,791
Bloody hell, crazy motherfucker

826
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:13,749
Hey what do you want?

827
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:23,999
Ma'am, one extra large cup
of watermelon juice

828
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:32,791
What the hell do you want?

829
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:59,374
S-I-S-T-E-R

830
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:25,166
Ready?

831
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:29,249
That monster

832
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:31,749
Will definitely go back
to where they were separated

833
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:34,583
Anything?

834
01:20:39,249 --> 01:20:39,749
Yes

835
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:41,249
She responded

836
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,249
You two

837
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:44,791
Take this path

838
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:46,833
Boobies-lover

839
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:48,749
Take this one

840
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,041
I'll take this one

841
01:20:50,124 --> 01:20:51,583
Which ever route she takes

842
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:55,249
The little one's blood will draw her here

843
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,249
Right here

844
01:20:58,874 --> 01:21:00,208
We'll kill her right here

845
01:21:03,624 --> 01:21:04,749
She must be able to smell

846
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:07,374
Therefore we can't douse the little one
in gas first

847
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:09,916
Put the gasoline in the water tank

848
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:12,583
Wei-zhu, you hide in there

849
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,041
Signal us when the monster comes

850
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,999
Seal off all the exits

851
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:27,458
Make her come through here

852
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:28,999
Boobies-lover

853
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:31,916
Lock the door once she's in there

854
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,291
Guo-feng

855
01:21:35,374 --> 01:21:37,083
You'll open the water tank

856
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:39,916
And pour the gasoline in

857
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:41,333
And the boss will light it up

858
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:41,999
Boom

859
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:44,958
“Like shooting shrimp in a barrel”

860
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,208
What if

861
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:06,291
She doesn't show up

862
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,666
She will

863
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,999
I'm the slowest one here

864
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:37,999
What if I don't close the door quick enough

865
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:41,333
If so then the monster will kill you

866
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:46,791
I think the fastest person should
close the door

867
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,749
Let's vote then

868
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:51,083
Raise your hand if you want me to do it

869
01:23:54,749 --> 01:23:57,124
Those who want boobies-lover
raise your hand

870
01:23:59,249 --> 01:24:00,291
What if

871
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:02,041
the monster happens to

872
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:02,874
see me first?

873
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:03,749
What do I do?

874
01:24:04,249 --> 01:24:05,999
Then you're so doomed

875
01:24:26,749 --> 01:24:28,624
I'm sure that you know

876
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:31,249
What we've done these few days

877
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,999
I've got this

878
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,041
After your sister unchains you

879
01:24:37,499 --> 01:24:39,458
You can jump out from here

880
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,249
You should know

881
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:50,208
I've been such a loser

882
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,541
But

883
01:24:53,499 --> 01:24:56,958
I want to get this last thing right

884
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:28,124
(15 minutes to sunset)

885
01:25:44,624 --> 01:25:47,041
Fuck! You've got balls

886
01:25:50,874 --> 01:25:52,624
The boss called it

887
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,624
The bigger monster

888
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:58,249
would go back to where she lost the little one

889
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:48,499
(The app says daybreaks in 15 minutes)

890
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:13,749
Wei-zhu

891
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:15,624
What

892
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,083
Can I switch with you?

893
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:19,916
Didn't we vote on this?

894
01:28:19,999 --> 01:28:21,333
Go back

895
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,416
When I was running back and forth

896
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,958
I happened to sprain my ankle

897
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:28,291
I want to switch with you

898
01:28:28,374 --> 01:28:30,833
Can't you see I'll freak out too

899
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:32,291
Stop messing around

900
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,958
Aren't we friends?

901
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,916
Will you send your friend to hell?

902
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:58,708
What do you want?

903
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,541
Back then

904
01:29:00,624 --> 01:29:03,166
Why framed me for stealing the class fees?

905
01:29:03,249 --> 01:29:05,708
What's the point of talking about this

906
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,874
Just for fun

907
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:59,583
(She is here)

908
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:40,083
C'mon

909
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:42,499
C'mon

910
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:45,708
C'mon

911
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,583
Show yourself

912
01:32:04,249 --> 01:32:05,833
Open the door

913
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:06,958
This was not the plan

914
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:08,416
Of course this wasn't the plan

915
01:32:08,499 --> 01:32:09,874
We are not friends at all

916
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:12,291
We are friends! We're bros

917
01:32:12,374 --> 01:32:13,541
Bullshit

918
01:32:13,624 --> 01:32:17,083
You guys will torture me to death one day

919
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:31,624
Then why help the monster?

920
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,291
That thing eats people

921
01:32:33,374 --> 01:32:34,791
So what if she eats people?

922
01:32:34,874 --> 01:32:36,124
Bullying the monster

923
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:37,666
Won't make us saints

924
01:32:37,749 --> 01:32:39,458
It will only make us worse

925
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:42,458
Open the door

926
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:44,999
You can kill me in a hundred ways

927
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,166
Open the door

928
01:32:46,249 --> 01:32:47,541
Now

929
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:50,333
Is my only shot to kill you

930
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:45,166
You know that you and me
we're on the same side

931
01:33:45,249 --> 01:33:47,749
You'll tell your sister not to kill me right?

932
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:48,749
You know

933
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,791
Tell me that you know

934
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:38,999
I'm not like them

935
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:39,999
I am here to save your sister

936
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:41,124
Otherwise she would've died

937
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:42,666
I'm not like them

938
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,374
I fed her blood

939
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:47,666
I'm the good guy

940
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:58,833
Save me

941
01:39:33,624 --> 01:39:37,041
100 dollars. Find change yourself

942
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,583
Find change yourself

943
01:40:59,416 --> 01:41:01,999
You're not like us
