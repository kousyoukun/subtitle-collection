on "Skarfolksgaten,"

then you will turn right

[Chris chuckles]

In 100 meters,

00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:28,691
turn left
on "Skarfolksgaten."

26
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,389
No, I didn't add
any new locations.

27
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,460
The casino was there
in the first place.

28
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,807
-[man on phone] Yeah, okay, bud.
-In fact, there were two of them

and I cut it down to one,
so if this...

30
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,089
If their problem is that
there's not enough psychological
detail or description,

31
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,023
then it's easy, we just find
someone and they put it back in.

32
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,992
-They put it back in, right?
-I think they'd like to push
the shoot back another month,

33
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,166
so we've got time
to figure it out.

34
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:58,686
Yeah, well, if they push,
they're gonna lose
half the cast.

35
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,309
They know that, right?

[mechanical whirring]

41
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,059
Hey.

42
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,236
I think I left my sunglasses
at the airport.

43
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,483
Thank you.

44
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,077
[Tony] Wow!

45
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:28,017
[gentle music]

46
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:37,707

you will reach your

47
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:41,918
[Tony] Oh, that has got
to be her.

48
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,802
-[Ase] You didn't get lost.
-Miracle of GPS.

49
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,392
Ah, good, because no one here
would have helped you.

50
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,359
There is a secret pact
between the people

51
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,672
-of Faro and Bergman.
-Good to know.

52
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,434
-Ase, nice to meet you.
-Tony. And you.

53
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:15,711
-Ase.
-Chris.

54
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,332
I take care of the houses.

55
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,852
It's beautiful.

56
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,337
-Yeah, it's gorgeous.
-[Ase] Yeah.

57
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,789
In that house,
you'll find Bergman's
private screening room,

58
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,136
where you can see 35mm prints

59
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,034
during Bergman Week.

60
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,381
-Wow.
-Wow.

61
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:36,352
You're free to use
the bicycles.

62
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,527
Oh. Nice.

63
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,564
[Ase] And if you want
to go to Lauter

64
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:43,739
to visit Bergman's home,

65
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,914
it's a 10-minute
bike ride from here.

66
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,537
[Tony] Fantastic.

67
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:54,991
-This is the living room.
-Oh.

68
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,407
And this TV,
it's very, very old,

69
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,031
but it works.

70
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,757
This was Kabi Laretei's piano.

71
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,483
His fourth wife.

72
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,726
She was a great pianist.

73
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,732
You'll see, this place
is perfect for working.

74
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,562
[Tony] Sure.

75
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,874
It's a very simple house,

76
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,049
easy to live in.

77
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:19,706
The bedrooms are upstairs.

78
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:22,191
The big one was
in Scenes From A Marriage,

79
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:25,505
the film that made
millions of people divorce.

80
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:29,129
Oh, I have to show you
for the garbage.

81
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,546
In Sweden, we are very serious
about recycling.

82
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,903
-[Tony] Hey.
-[Chris] Hey.

83
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,979
I can go somewhere else
if you want.

84
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:53,593
Chris?

85
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,635
Chris!

86
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:12,784
-Chris!
-[Chris] Tony!

87
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,097
Over here in the mill!

88
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,103
[seagulls calling]

89
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:28,386
-[Tony] Where are you?
-Hey.

90
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:30,146
I think I'll be
setting up in here.

91
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,942
We can wave at each other.

92
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,190
Wow.

93
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:45,990
But don't you think
it's too nice?

94
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,716
Too...

95
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,684
Too what?

96
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:52,548
Beautiful.

97
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,688
All this calm and perfection.

98
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:55,724
I find it oppressive.

99
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,484
No. It's soothing.

100
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,590
[sighs] Yeah,
but I didn't realize,

101
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,213
you know, writing here,

102
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:04,698
how can I not feel like a loser?

103
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:07,563
I'm even afraid
to sit at a desk.

104
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,738
Well, write outside, then.

105
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,292
A lot of people come
here to work--

106
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,709
students, writers, designers.

107
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,230
No one's expecting Persona.

108
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,232
Yeah, well, thank God for that.

109
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,029
-[shuts window]
-You do realize

110
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:28,066
we're going to sleep in the bed

111
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,413
where they shot
Scenes From A Marriage.

112
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:33,209
"The film that made
millions of people divorce."

113
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:36,626
-I know.
-We have to maybe
sleep in the other bedroom.

114
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,732
Separate beds?

115
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,906
Yeah.

116
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,633
[gentle music]

117
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:20,878
[Tony] Enjoy!

118
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:31,233
[startled shouting. laughing]

119
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,656
[gentle music continues]

[people chattering]

121
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,776
-Tony.
-Hello. Nice to see you.

122
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:58,398
-Nice to see you.
-This is Chris.

123
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,640
-Hi, Chris.
-Hello.

124
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,297
And this is Hedda,

125
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,230
who's the head
of the Bergman Foundation.

126
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,025
-And, uh...
-It's an honor to meet you.

127
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,062
...Berit, who's in charge...
-Finally!

128
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,547
-...of the Bergman Week.
-After all the emails.

129
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:13,689
He said it would be easier
to divide up money than homes.

130
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,242
Nine children.

131
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,692
-Nine!
-[Stig] Nine.

132
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,246
-From six different women.
-Wow.

133
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,248
Didn't it bother him

134
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,319
that everything would be
sold to strangers?

135
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:24,976
He wasn't sentimental.

136
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,322
He lived in the present.

137
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,877
Did he believe in God?
I mean,

138
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,914
it was complicated, I'm sure,
but did he ever talk about it?

139
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:35,159
He always said that death
was just a light going out.

140
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,368
That changed after Ingrid died.

141
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:40,716
Bergman believed in ghosts
more than anything.

142
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,270
When you live alone
on a remote island, you know...

143
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,272
He felt Ingrid's presence
in the house.

144
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,722
He said she was there.

145
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,483
He was absolutely
convinced of it.

146
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:53,004
-[woman] I have a table ready
for you inside now.
-[Hedda] Thank you.

147
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,700
[woman] It's right here
by the bar.

148
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,738
[chattering]

149
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:14,370
How was his relationship
with his children?

150
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:16,821
He didn't see much of them
when they were young.

151
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,548
He wasn't much of a family man,
to put it mildly.

152
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,412
For years, one of his daughters

153
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,448
didn't even know
he was her father.

154
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:25,278
[woman] You can sit down now.

155
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,970
Then there was a big reunion
at his 60th birthday.

156
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,628
Ingrid had persuaded him
to invite everybody.

157
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,733
Ingrid was adamant about

158
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,358
reconstructing Bergman's
relationship with his family.

159
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,744
So, do you think

160
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,437
you can create
a great body of work

161
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:48,646
and raise a family
at the same time?

162
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:50,579
A body of work of that scope?

163
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:54,307
At the age of 42,
Bergman had directed 25 films,

164
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:56,516
run a theater,
staged many plays.

165
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,311
How do you think
he would he have done that

166
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,623
if he was also changing diapers?

167
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,594
-How do you feel about that?
-[Tony] In practical terms,

168
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,837
raising nine kids,
directing 50 films,

169
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,805
not to mention the plays,
seems like a tall order.

170
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,014
Yeah, but
in non-practical terms,

171
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:14,775
the mothers
raised all the nine kids
and he didn't do a thing.

172
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,294
How do you feel about that?

173
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,124
-I should I feel bad, right?
-No.

174
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,333
It's just because you like him
so much, I'm wondering.

175
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:22,266
Yeah, but you do too.

176
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:24,371
It's true that a woman couldn't
have done the same thing.

177
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:28,824
I mean, I would like to have
nine kids

178
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,653
from five different men.

179
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,862
That's nice.

180
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,693
It's just I--

181
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,350
I like a certain coherence.

182
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,524
I don't like it
when artists I love

183
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:41,285
don't behave well in real life.

184
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,665
So you have your answer, Chris.

185
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:48,326
Bergman was as cruel in his art
as in his life.

186
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,121
Right.

187
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:51,709
Still...

I'm off.

199
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:33,121
-Where?
-Got a panel.

200
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,468
-Wanna come?
-No.

201
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:38,126
Oh. Don't wanna see
the Bergman Center?

202
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,645
-I'll see it tomorrow.
-Okay.

203
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:42,958
Fine.

204
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:44,960
Good luck.

-[Chris] Hey.

00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,992
-How did it go?
-It was good.

210
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,444
People were nice.
It's great to see
The Silence there.

211
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:15,653
I talked too much, but...

212
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,587
-You want some tea?
-I'd love some, yeah.

213
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,117
I miss June.

214
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,775
Oh, I got a video from your mom.

215
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,501
I didn't.

216
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,641
I know, but that's
because I'm her favorite.

217
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:40,471
There you go.

[TV playing]

220
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,318
From the Life of Marionettes,
pretty hardcore Bergman there.

221
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,181
[Chris] Yeah,
but it's a German one.

222
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,838
I'd like to see a Swedish one.
Like a summer film.

223
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:05,185
-Not Monika.
-Yeah, Monika, please.

224
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,222
Nah, seen it too often.

225
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,258
-[Tony] After the Rehearsal?
-Fanny and Alexander?

226
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:11,847
Same thing.
I know that one by heart.

227
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:13,228
The Seventh Seal.

228
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,368
No, I can't stand that one.

229
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:18,095
But it's his most famous one,
and I haven't seen it.

230
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,546
-Hour of the Wolf?
-No, that's the one

231
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:22,548
where a child's head
gets bashed against a boulder.

232
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,135
Right.

233
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:25,274
No, if we don't see
Seventh Seal,

234
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:26,759
then at least a nice one.

235
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:28,208
There's no such thing.

236
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,866
Then we download a film.

237
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:32,247
You wanted to see Everest.
It's easier.

-Source!
-I know.

239
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:36,182
Saraband.

240
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,701
Yeah, Saraband.

241
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,910
-I don't have that one.
-Oh, fuck.

242

Or else I have a 35mm print.
We showed it earlier.

It's going back
to Stockholm tomorrow.

244

-Cries and Whispers.

-You wanted a nice Bergman.
-Hmm.

246
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,888
Alright, you can sit
anywhere you want,

247
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:54,787
but not in that seat
on the first row.

248
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:57,617
It has to stay empty
because it's Bergman's.

249
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:00,379
-Right?
-Thanks.

00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:26,741
It's a like a horror movie
without catharsis.

259
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,605
[Tony] Your point being?

260
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:32,194
Well, usually when you
come out of a horror movie,

261
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,852
you feel reassured

262
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,958
because you know what you
just saw can't happen to you.

263
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:39,029
Not with Cries and Whispers.

264
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:42,135
The solitude, the agony,
the horror of dying.

265
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,516
It's the way things are.

266
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:45,725
No, it's not.
It's a dream.

267
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:48,072
Or more like
a fucking nightmare.

268
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,972
I just hope he had more fun
in his life than in his movies.

Me too.

270
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,117
Why are his characters
always so awful?

271
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:01,085
Why doesn't he ever show any
tenderness or lightness?

272
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:03,605
There's loads
in Fanny and Alexander.

273
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:05,262
True, but that came late.

274
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,919
Yeah, but it's good that
it came late, right?

275
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:08,748
He wasn't interested
in being light.

276
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,544
He--he was dark,
and he wanted to explore that.

277
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:12,821
It was fun for him.

278
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:15,583
Why didn't he ever once

279
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:17,032
want to explore--

280
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,207
-Happiness?
-Yeah, happiness!

281
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:21,796
I mean, look at this place.

282
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:25,075
His houses, the island,
beautiful landscapes.

283
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:28,423
Everything is less harsh
than in his movies.

284
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,598
Then try this place
in fucking January.

285

No, thank you.

286

What's the matter?

287
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:42,713
Movies can be terribly sad,

288
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:44,991
tough, violent,

289
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,304
but in the end,
they do you good.

-No.

Just hurt me.

292
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,827
Then why do you
watch them then?

293

Because I love them.

your movies again?

-No. I hate it.
-Bergman used to say that Hell,
to him,

would be if he had
to watch his own movies

[Tony] All of my life,

317
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,915
I felt like I was, um,
on a tightrope,

318
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:59,401
you know, I was
kind of balancing,

319
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,610
and, uh, if I fell--
if I fell off, I just--

320
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,130
I'd be lost,
I'd be completely gone.

321
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:07,858
And so, as a filmmaker,
only really felt, um...

322

[stammers]

00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,345
...secure, I suppose,

324
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,795
and--and comfortable

325
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,763
if the central character
of the story

326
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:19,249
I was telling at that particular
time was, um, female.

327
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:23,425
The women, they keep you
in touch with reality and--

328
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:26,256
But at the same time,
they are the ones who

329
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:27,947
pull you into fiction.

330
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:30,087
They drive the action
in most of your films.

331
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,433
[Tony] The women do, yeah.

332
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,815
-[man] Hey.
-Hello.

333
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:10,300
[quiet chatter]

334
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:36,705
Hey, uh, can I get these?

335
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:37,948
[man] Yeah, sure.

336
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:39,950
800 crowns please.

337
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,814
You're lost.

338
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:17,539
Over there.

339
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:18,678
You have to go around.

340
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,819
Oh, thank you.

341
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,204
How are things
through Bibi's glasses?

342
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:28,896
-Much better.
--Hampus.

343
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,932
-Chris.
-You do the residency?

344
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,693
Oh, yeah. Well, with my friend,
Anthony Sanders.

345
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,523
-And you?
-Me too.

346
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,181
I'm working on my short
graduation film here.

347
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,046
But I know Faro.
My grandparents are from here.

348
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,304
I was supposed to stay
until mid-August,

349
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,238
but I'm leaving tomorrow
to see my grandfather.

350
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,930
He's dying.

351
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:04,379
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:06,105
Oh, he's old.

353
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:08,418
I'd like to see Bergman's grave.

354
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:11,524
-Do you know where it is?
-Sure, come on.

355
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,149
I saw your last film
at Goteborg with my girlfriend.

356
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,979
-Oh.
-Besides us,
the theater was empty.

357
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:19,808
Then we got in a fight
afterwards,

358
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:22,121
because I liked it and
she didn't. She hated it.

359
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,468
-We broke up afterwards.
-Over the movie?

360
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,505
No, not over the movie.

361
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:28,887
[leaves rustling in the wind]

362
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,025
Bergman directed his own death.

363
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:06,338
He decided everything
in advance:

364
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:08,823
the spot, the wood of
the coffin, and what he'd wear.

365
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,790
Hedda from the Foundation said

366
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,276
that after his wife died,

367
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:15,795
he started believing
in an afterlife.

368
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,556
He was the son of a minister.

369
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:19,489
So, the question of faith
always followed him.

370
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:22,664
[speaks in foreign language]

371
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,528
[translates in English] "Oh,
God, why have you abandoned me?"

372
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,600
But nobody in Sweden
really cares now.

373
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:31,466
Oh, fuck!

374
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:34,193
I'm supposed to do
the Bergman Safari.

375
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,161
Bergman Safari,
you can skip that.

376
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,818
Yeah, it's for Tony.
He didn't want to do it alone.

377
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,613
If you want to see
the Bergman spots,

378
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:41,994
I can show them to you.

379
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:43,513
I can also show you others.

380
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,032
Ones you'd never see
on the Safari.

381
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,481
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

382
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,414
-It was fabulous.
-Oh, thank you.

383
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,141
-Sorry, can I have an autograph?
-Yeah, absolutely.

384
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,144
[chatter]

385
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:56,112
-Here you are.
-Thank you so very much.

386
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,424
It was fascinating.
I admire everything you do.

387
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:01,910
-Oh, thank you.
-Can I have a photo please?

388
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:04,913
-I just love your work.
-Thank you.

389
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:06,432
-Keep going.
-Thank you very much.

390
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,089
Can I please have
your autograph?

391
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:09,918
Your my favorite director.

392
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:12,024
You're the reason why
I started studying cinema.

393
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:14,268
-Thank you.
-Nice to have met you.

394
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,063
Okay.

395
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:22,000
[Hampus] I have some cider.
It's local cider.
It's delicious.

396
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:23,760
It's in the back.
Can you open it?

397
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:25,762
Sure.

398
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,395
Where are we going?

399
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,950
I was thinking
Ullahau to start.

400
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,193
[Chris] Ullahau?

401
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,165
Hello, everyone.

402
00:33:49,303 --> 00:33:51,581
I think that we're all here,
so we can get going!

403
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:54,032
My name is Felicia, and
I'm happy to be your guide

404
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,895
for the annual Bergman Safari.

405
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,967
My two colleagues,
Vivianne and Majken,

406
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,314
are going to help me out.

407
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:02,074
It is a nice, sunny day,

408
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:03,903
which is a great plus.

409
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,665
For those of you who downloaded
the app on your iPhones,

410
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:09,116
now is the time to start it.

411
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:11,808
With it, you'll be able
to follow our journey

412
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:13,257
on the map of Faro.

413
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:15,570
Now, if you all
come onto the bus.

414
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:18,746
I didn't introduce you earlier,
Francisco Molina,
Anthony Sanders.

415
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,472
-How do you do.
-Pleasure.

416
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,474
Francisco teaches
at University of Barcelona.

417
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:25,235
And he was the hands-down winner
of last night's Bergman Quiz.

418
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:26,822
-Wow.
-Yeah.

419
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,963
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

420
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,379
[chatter]

421
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,594
[bus engine starts]

422
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,463
[woman in video
speaks foreign language]

423
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,329
[quiet chatter]

424
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,781
You know, Bergman didn't like
that movie.

425
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,783
Yeah, that's why they
went to Italy.

426
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,130
Yeah. it's got
all the stuff about

427
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:00,546
his personal life,
his marriages--

428
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,479
We're arriving at the spot
where Bergman shot
Through a Glass Darkly,

429
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,895
the film which allowed him
to discover Faro.

430
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:08,140
At first, Bergman didn't want
to shoot it in Sweden.

431
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,969
He wanted to go
to the Orkney Islands

432
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,006
off the Scottish coast.

433
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:14,042
But the producers thought that
that would be far too expensive.

434
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,184
So, they tried to persuade him
to film it in Sweden instead.

435
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:51,839
This place came to be
around 1700.

436
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,772
People started
cutting down the trees,

437
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,877
and the sand would
blow in from the north,

438
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:58,535
creating these dunes
in the clearings.

439
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:00,744
Ullahau means
"the rolling dunes",

440
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:03,816
because people thought this
meant judgment day was coming.

441
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,335
And they used to say...

442
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,648
[speaks Swedish]

443
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:13,757
which means that
when Ullahau and sand high meet,

444
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:16,104
judgment day is near.

445
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,866
And then a man planted
many new trees,

446
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,351
stopping more sand
from coming in.

447
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:25,493
But the dunes that were
already here, they remained.

448
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:42,096
This makes me
want to go to the beach.

449
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:45,306
-It's no problem.
-A nice sandy beach.

450
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:48,896
There is two of them, the north
beach and the south beach.

451
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,899
The south beach is large,
with big waves.

452
00:36:52,037 --> 00:36:53,832
It's more touristy.

453
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,801
The north has no tourists,
no wind, the water is clear,

454
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:00,735
-but lots of jellyfish.
-No way.

455
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:02,979
Yeah, but they're harmless.

456
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:05,671
And the south does have a few
which are stingers.

457
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,466
Much, much worse.

458
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:09,951
[chatter]

459
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:16,751
So, the house in the film
was here.

460
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:20,099
Actually, they only built
the facade and the interiors

461
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,137
-were mostly shot in studio.
-[man] What happened
to the house?

462
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:27,486
[Felicia] Well, they had
to tear it down after the shoot.

463
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,488
Bergman was looking for
a small garden

464
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,250
with old trees, and that's part
of why he picked this spot.

465
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:34,217
The trees are still here,

466
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:36,806
and you can also see where
they took down the wall.

467
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:41,466
Here you can see that
the wall has been replaced.

468
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:46,056
All the way to, uh... here.

469
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:49,094
So, the stones are different.
These are the ones they used

470
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:50,682
when they rebuilt the wall.

471
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,271
And, if you look over here,

472
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:58,517
you can see where the jetty
once was built.

473
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:02,659
So, that was like the foundation
of the jetty.

474
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:06,836
And, uh, this tree
is actually also in the movie,

475
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,838
but it was really small then.

476
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:10,460
So, it has grown a lot

477
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:14,015
since the film was made
about 60 years ago.

478
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:18,054
When Bergman arrived in Faro,
something happened.

479
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:20,574
It was love at first sight.

480
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:23,231
Bergman was dazzled
by the island's beauty.

481
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,925
It was as if he had found
his own landscape,

482
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:30,031
one that already existed
inside of him.

483

[chatter]

485
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,543
Before making Persona,
Bergman had been hospitalized,

486
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:01,200
suffering both mental
and physical exhaustion.

487
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,894
But after Persona,
he was as happy as ever.

488
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:08,898
Persona incarnates this
transition and this fullness.

489
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:10,865
Bergman never forgot it.

490
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:13,730
He said that Persona was
the film that saved his life.

491
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,561
[inspirational music]

492
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,743
[man] Is it Shame or The Shame?

493
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:28,435
[Felicia] In Swedish
it's Skammen,

494
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:30,160
which means "The Shame",

495
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,715
but the English title
is Shame,I think.

496
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:36,719
Oddly enough, in the UK
it was released as The Shame.

497
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:39,894
[music and chatter continue]

498
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:51,250
[Felicia] Bergman knew that he
would receive a lot of criticism

499
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,563
for evoking Vietnam
in this manner.

500
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,738
Because the debate in Sweden
about the war

501
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,222
was very black and white.

502
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,742
His film is extremely gray.

503
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,985
[music continues]

504
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:05,403

[laughter]

509
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,333
Would you like to buy
some lambskin?

510
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,784
Um... yeah.

511
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,827
I can't choose.

512
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:55,349
I prefer the black,
long-haired ones.

513
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:58,628
But they're more expensive.

514
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,391
[chatter]

515
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,498
Yeah, totally.

516
00:41:06,636 --> 00:41:08,086
So, guys, guys!

517
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,157
We traditionally end
the Bergman Safari

518
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:11,745
by having a lamb burger.

519
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,851
-Is everyone up for it?
-[all agreeing]

520
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:17,923
-Otherwise you can
have a veggie burger.
-[man] No!

521
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,719
Comprising of Hour of the Wolf,
Shame, The Passion of Anna.

522
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:23,515
Uh, you know, Bergman
didn't see them that way.

523
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,655
Yeah, but, you know,
he didn't consider

524
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:28,071
Through a Glass Darkly,
The Silence,and Winter Light

525
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,557
as a trilogy, and yet,
some critics still see them

526
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:32,351
as a trilogy about
the loss of faith.

527
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,870
I mean, he definitely said
they were a trilogy,

528
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,389
but then walked it back.

529
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:36,701
Just because he said
it's a trilogy

530
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,047
doesn't mean it is one.

531
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,325
Yeah, sure.

532
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:51,094
Thank you
for the Hampus Safari.

533
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:52,337
I hope you enjoyed it.

534
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:53,890
I loved it.

535
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:56,272
Don't forget your sheepskins.

536
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,874
-See you.
-Bye.

537
00:42:19,778 --> 00:42:21,746
-Hey.
-[Chris] Hey.

538
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:27,890
Très chic.

539
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:31,238
Thanks for the support.

540
00:42:31,376 --> 00:42:33,620
I saw the bus and freaked out.
I'm sorry.

541
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,380
That's alright.

542
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,073
How was it?

543
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:41,973
It was pretty good, actually.

544
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,700
Yeah.

545
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:46,529
But I've been feeling
a bit yuck since I got back.

546
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:49,739
-Why, what happened?
-Must have been the burger.

547
00:42:52,777 --> 00:42:54,710
So, where were you?

548
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:57,264
Driving around.

549
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:58,610
Oh, yeah. driving around?

550
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,681
Mmm. I met a guy.

551
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh, you met a guy? Sure.

552
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:03,995
-A student.
-Hmm.

553
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:05,755
-A student, was he?
-A film student from Stockholm.

554
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:08,482
Oh. Was he handsome,
was he sexy, was he?

555
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,173
-Yeah.
-Oh.

556
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,624
Was he brilliant
when he talked about Bergman?

557
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:15,316
Not like you, but, um,
his clumsiness had its charm.

558
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:18,526
Oh, thanks. Shut up.

Hey. Hi.

I'm looking for the house

571
00:47:18,663 --> 00:47:20,907
from Through a Glass Darkly.

572
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:23,150
Bergman's film.

573
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,051
Sorry, don't understand English.

574
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:29,847
Ingmar Bergman?

575
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:33,264
The filmmaker
who lived on the island.

576
00:47:33,402 --> 00:47:35,197
Sorry.

577
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,372

-Yikes.
-[sighs]

585
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:43,127
I went to see the house from
Through a Glass Darkly,

586
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:44,645
but I couldn't find it.

587
00:48:44,783 --> 00:48:47,096
-There isn't one. Never was.
-What?

588
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:49,064
But the picture on the map?

589
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:51,514
They built the facade, and they
shot the interiors in a studio.

Bergman Safari, babes.

[Tony] How's it going?
Where you at?

592
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:01,145
[sighs] I'm still
doing the outline,

593
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:03,664
but I don't know
if I want to write it.

594
00:49:03,802 --> 00:49:05,839
Why not?

595
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,359
Because I'm afraid it's
like stuff I've already done.

596
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:11,810
No... not possible.

597
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:12,950
I thought we spent
all whole lives

598
00:49:13,088 --> 00:49:14,813
saying the same thing.

599
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,678
We do, but from
different perspectives.

600
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:19,991
You just gotta trust yourself.

601
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:29,311
Characters, the dialogues,
the situations, it all fits,

602
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:31,865
but something
is holding me back.

603
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:33,418
Something is making me anxious.

604
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:35,075
Oh, well, that's different.

605
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:38,389
If it's making you anxious,
take a break.

606
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:40,874
You just said "write".
Now you say "don't write".

607
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:42,841
That doesn't help.
It's not easy!

608
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,326
You know how hard
writing is for me.

609
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:45,568
It's--it's torture.

610
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:47,053
It's self-inflicted agony.

611
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:48,606
It's blood from a stone.

612
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:53,266
Well, then, do something else!

613
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:55,613
Yeah, like what,
full-time housewife?

614
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,684
Well, it's an honorable
profession.

615
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:06,762
You know, there's no reason
writing has to be
so difficult for you.

616
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,729
You're not 15.
You've outgrown that.

617
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:11,594
Well, maybe I am
because I haven't.

618
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:16,392
Write something else.

619
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,738
It's not like I have
a ton of projects

620
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:19,533
lined up in my head.

621
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:23,675
I really thought
you would encourage me.

622
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,022
I'm trying.

623
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:28,922
You know I love your work.

624
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,410
How's your thing going?

625
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:36,792
Um, pretty good, actually.

626
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,450
What's it about?

627
00:50:39,588 --> 00:50:41,279
It's about, um,

628
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:45,145
how invisible things circulate

629
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:47,182
within a couple.

630
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:50,392
And the story?

631
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:55,811
Why don't you ever
tell me anything?
I tell you everything.

632
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,951
-Don't wanna jinx it.
-Oh.

633
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,059
Can you tell me
where it takes place?

634
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:03,267
Here.

635
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:05,338
-Here?! Faro?
-Yeah.

636
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:07,271
Don't say that like
I'm supposed to know.

637
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:08,755
-Well, I thought you did.
-No, I don't,

638
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:10,757
because
you don't tell me anything.

639
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:19,973
-[Tony] I've got a title.
-Mmm.

640
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,734
You can keep it to yourself.

00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:50,797
What's the matter?

643
00:51:57,252 --> 00:51:59,116
Is it your script?

644
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:12,198
Miss June, you want to go home?

645
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:14,269
You sure?

646
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:20,067
[sobs quietly]

647
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:25,659
[birds singing]

648
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:36,498
[writing on paper]

649
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:14,777
Can I tell you about
what I'm writing?

650
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:16,779
Yeah.

651
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:20,921
It's the last episode
of a longer story.

652
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:23,545
So, maybe it's too flimsy
and not enough for a movie,

653
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:26,272
-but I would like your opinion.
-Okay.

654
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,929
So it takes place

655
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:32,278
over three days at a wedding.

656
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,281
I don't know where yet,

657
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:39,077
but maybe a place like here.

658
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,838
Like Faro.

659
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:43,910
An island, actually,
would work very well.

660
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:47,327
Um, and it could
start on the plane.

661
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:49,709
Or maybe on a boat.

662
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:51,642
[magical music]

663
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,609
[Chris] So, we're on a ferry
in the Baltic Sea,

664
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:55,784
from the mainland to Gotland.

665
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:58,925
It's a four-hour ride,
and it's spring.

666
00:53:59,063 --> 00:54:01,652
Or maybe it should be summer.

667
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,309
It's late summer.

668
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:05,000
[chatter]

669
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:06,933
A young woman
looks into the distance.

670
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:09,176
Her name is Amy.

671
00:54:09,315 --> 00:54:12,766
She's about my age
or maybe a bit younger.

672
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:15,631
Let's say she's 28.

673
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:19,186
[music continues]

674
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:23,501
She's the main character
of the film.

675
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,297
She arrived in Stockholm
that morning from New York.

676
00:54:26,435 --> 00:54:28,541
She's come for the wedding
of an old friend, Nicolette,

677
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:33,200
who's marrying a Swede
named Jonas.

678
00:54:33,339 --> 00:54:34,995
The celebration takes place
on an island

679
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:37,135
off the northern tip
of Gotland.

680
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,379
An island called Faro.

681
00:54:39,517 --> 00:54:41,899
Which is hardly
insignificant to Amy,

682
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:44,315
-as she's a director.
-Alright.

683
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:47,870
And Bergman occupies
a very important place
in her imagination.

684
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:50,735
For many,
he's a formidable reference,

685
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:53,013
but for her, he is...

686
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:55,913
sort of refuge, a consolation.

687
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:58,364
-Mm-hmm.
-And yet...

688
00:54:58,502 --> 00:55:01,401
and yet it's not him she's
thinking about right now.

689
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:04,335
Another man
is monopolizing her thoughts.

690
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:06,924
Joseph is his name.

691
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:09,409
Joseph she can't let go.

692
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:13,931
Amy was 15 when she met Joseph,
who was 17.

693
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:19,039
They loved each other
passionately and awkwardly,
like teenagers do.

694
00:55:19,177 --> 00:55:21,525
And they tore each other
to pieces.

695
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:25,218
Joseph left Amy the day
she turned 18.

696
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:28,359
They each went
their own ways,

697
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,603
but Amy never forgot Joseph.

698
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,191
When they saw each other again
years later,

699
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,056
they realized that their
feelings were still there.

700
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:38,714
The attraction
was still overwhelming.

701
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,268
They became lovers.

702
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:43,236
They were more mature,

703
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:45,203
understood each other better,

704
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,551
but circumstances had changed.

705
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:50,243
And there was no place
in their lives
for this love story anymore.

706
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:54,420
The first time had been
too soon, second too late.

707
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:57,837
So, they gave up and
stopped seeing each other.

708
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:01,427
I'd like this film to be

709
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:03,394
the last chapter
of their story,

710
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:05,292
which was just a series
of failures

711
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:07,398
and betrayals and dramas.

712
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:09,435
The story
of impossible mourning,

713
00:56:09,573 --> 00:56:11,989
of suffering, overshadowed
by a few memories

714
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:14,578
of intense happiness.

715
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:18,720
So, following
Nicolette's advice,

716
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:21,895
Amy met up with
two of Jonas' friends.

717
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:25,105
They were going to Faro by car
from Stockholm.

718
00:56:25,243 --> 00:56:26,728
Joseph did the same thing,

719
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:30,248
though he started out
from Oslo.

720
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,907
And so, after
several years apart,

721
00:56:34,045 --> 00:56:35,461
the two lovers find themselves

722
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,601
sitting in the back seat
of a car

723
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:40,189
driven by total strangers.

724
00:56:40,327 --> 00:56:45,091
Wilma and Peter don't know
of Joseph's and Amy's past.

725
00:56:45,229 --> 00:56:47,162
By tacit agreement,
they play dumb.

726
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,165
Out of bashfulness,
or as a game,

727
00:56:50,303 --> 00:56:54,549
they pretend they vaguely
know each other.

728
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:58,104
This charade only increases
Amy's desire.

729
00:56:58,242 --> 00:57:00,969
Will you be spending any time
in Sweden after the wedding?

730
00:57:01,107 --> 00:57:03,005
No, I'm heading straight back.

731
00:57:03,143 --> 00:57:05,525
-I promised my daughter.
-Oh, sweet. How old?

732
00:57:05,663 --> 00:57:08,355
-She's four.
-[Wilma] Gorgeous.

733
00:57:08,494 --> 00:57:11,117
-[Peter] What about you?
-No kids.

734
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:13,637
I mean, are you staying
in Sweden after?

735
00:57:13,775 --> 00:57:17,675
Ah! No, I have to go
right back, actually.

736
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:19,643
Duty calls.

737
00:57:21,507 --> 00:57:24,855
Is it a problem if I don't have
a--a tie for church?

738
00:57:24,993 --> 00:57:27,685
I was going to buy one
at the airport, but I forgot.

739
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:29,998
-No, it's fine--
-I was also wondering,

740
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:33,104
I realized the dress
I planned to wear, it's white.

741
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:36,729
-It's my only nice dress.
-Well, usually, only the bride
wears white.

742
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:39,214
-Shit.
-I mean, you're gonna
have to ask Nicolette.

743
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:42,182
-She probably won't mind.
-Actually, I don't know that
it's really white.

744
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,153
It's more like off-white
or cream, kind of beige.

745
00:58:09,658 --> 00:58:11,867
[dog barks]

746
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,562
[Joseph] You want to go
to the upper deck?

747
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:46,557
I saw your movie.

748
00:58:46,695 --> 00:58:48,041
Oh.

749
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:50,043
You know that guy?

750
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:51,528
Wait, which guy?

751
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:53,012
The one who plays me.

752
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,461
Ah.

753
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,394
Yeah.

754
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,395
What about him?

755
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,880
I'm much better.

756
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:01,261
Really? In what ways?

757
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:03,609
In all departments.

758
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:05,749
Physically, to start with.

759
00:59:05,887 --> 00:59:08,441
And most of all as a person.
He's a--he's a prick.

760
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,926
Damn. I thought
I'd idealized you.

761
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:12,203
Idealized?

762
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:15,862
Okay. I hope you're kidding.

763
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:23,145
-We've been to Visby once.
-Shh!

764
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:26,424
To the medieval week.

765
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,806
-[Amy] What--
-They have, like,
a medieval-themed week

766
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:30,636
-where they--
-You went to that?

767
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:32,810
-Of course.
-Did you do reenactments?

768
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:35,502
-[laughter]
-[stammers] Kind of.

769
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:37,263
What do you mean?

770
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:40,887
[Wilma] Albatross.
We're here.

771
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:50,034
Jonas?

772
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:52,416
-[faint chatter]
-[Wilma] Nicolette?

773
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:55,453
-[Peter] Jonas?
-Nicolette?

774
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,042
[chatter grows louder]

775
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,803
[Joseph] Nicolette?

776
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:01,459
You can't see my dress!

777
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,255
-Okay, sorry.
-Really?

778
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:09,157
We found her in the dress.

779
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,884
Hey! How are you?

780
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:13,540
[Nicolette] I'm good. Frantic.

781
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:15,404
-Not too nervous?
-Yes, a bit.

782
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:17,475
-But compared to Jonas...
-I can imagine.

783
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,685
-[Nicolette]
Where are you staying?
-I'm at Sudersand.

784
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:21,514
-[Nicolette] And you?
-I'm here in Albatross.

785
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,136
-I even got the Bergman suite.
-I'm very jealous.

786
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:25,035
Yeah, well,
the toilet's in the garden.

787
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:26,692
-if that's any consolation!
-Okay.

788
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:30,040
[chatter continues]

789
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:40,464
I think we're down here.

790
01:00:41,396 --> 01:00:43,018
-See you later.
-See you.

791
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:29,893
[laughter and chatter]

792
01:01:30,894 --> 01:01:32,274
My grandparents grew up here,

793
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:35,208
so I spent my summer
vacations here.

794
01:01:35,346 --> 01:01:38,729
-Yeah. So, I know every inch.
-Did you meet Bergman?

795
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:41,042
Oh, Bergman, Bergman, Bergman.

796
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,320
Why is Sweden always
synonymous with Bergman?

797
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,736
No, come on.
You're getting married in Faro.

798
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:48,359
-It's kind of his island.
-Oh, his island?

799
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,327
I don't know.

-Hi, Anders.
-Hey, Chris.

1286
01:41:06,991 --> 01:41:09,615
For a second,
I didn't know where I was.

1287
01:41:09,753 --> 01:41:11,996
Everything was mixed up.

1288
01:41:12,135 --> 01:41:13,688
The crew left.
So, I thought you'd gone too.

1289
01:41:13,826 --> 01:41:16,967
I was tired.
I--I needed to lie down.

1290
01:41:17,105 --> 01:41:19,521
Yeah, we're all exhausted.

1291
01:41:19,659 --> 01:41:22,145
-But the shoot is almost over.
-Yeah.

1292
01:41:22,282 --> 01:41:24,216
You just got here?

1293
01:41:24,353 --> 01:41:27,184
No, I was watching you doing
the last shot of the day.

1294
01:41:27,322 --> 01:41:28,772
I didn't want to leave
the island

1295
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:30,429
without seeing Bergman's house.

1296
01:41:33,915 --> 01:41:36,607
Seriously, you could have
written a scene for me here.

1297
01:41:36,745 --> 01:41:38,609
I tried.

1298
01:41:38,746 --> 01:41:42,096
There was simply no reason
for your character to be here.

1299
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:45,858
Oh. It's almost five.

1300
01:41:45,996 --> 01:41:47,791
We have to leave
before the carriage

1301
01:41:47,929 --> 01:41:49,448
turns into a pumpkin.

1302
01:41:49,585 --> 01:41:51,621
Will you show me
the library first?

1303
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,348
Yeah.

1304
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:55,695
Follow me.

1305
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:02,668
An entire life
wouldn't be enough time

1306
01:42:02,806 --> 01:42:05,429
for me to read
one-quarter of these books.

1307
01:42:06,706 --> 01:42:09,192
This is my favorite object here.

1308
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:10,710
It's a model of the Dramaten,

1309
01:42:10,848 --> 01:42:12,816
the national theater
of Stockholm.

1310
01:42:12,954 --> 01:42:15,059
It was given to Bergman
when he left.

1311
01:42:20,513 --> 01:42:24,309
And who is in his favorite
position spying?

1312
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:33,423
-Ingmar Bergman.

[chatter]

1314
01:43:06,525 --> 01:43:09,528
There's a car leaving
for Albatross,
if anyone's interested.

1315
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:11,012
Me!

1316
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:13,359
So, this is goodbye.

1317
01:43:13,496 --> 01:43:15,291
Yeah, I'm off early tomorrow.

1318
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:17,536
I guess your wife and kid
will be waiting at the airport?

1319
01:43:17,674 --> 01:43:19,916
Yeah. I'd better find some nice
presents in Stockholm,

1320
01:43:20,055 --> 01:43:22,403
or I might as well
take the first plane back.

1321
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:24,370
Well, you can always
get sheepskins.

1322
01:43:24,508 --> 01:43:27,235
-Bye.
-Be well.

1323

-Safe travels.
-Bye.

1324
01:43:29,341 --> 01:43:31,584
[Chris] See you tomorrow!

1325
01:43:34,173 --> 01:43:36,486
So, one last game?

1326
01:43:36,624 --> 01:43:37,969
Yes.

1327
01:43:38,108 --> 01:43:40,421
One cigarette and we'll go.

1328
01:43:49,982 --> 01:43:52,571
-Back to the stable.
-No fucking way.

1329
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:55,746
I hate this game.
Can we stop it, please?

1330
01:43:55,884 --> 01:43:58,922
Just admit that
you don't like losing.

1331
01:43:59,059 --> 01:44:01,545
You don't like it
when things escape you.

1332
01:44:03,064 --> 01:44:06,585
If I needed a shrink,
you'd be the last--

1333
01:44:06,723 --> 01:44:09,864
you'd be the second last person
I'd go see.

1334
01:44:10,002 --> 01:44:11,969
-Who'd be the last?
-My mother.

1335
01:44:12,107 --> 01:44:14,178
-[chuckles]
-Oh, fuck.

1336
01:44:14,317 --> 01:44:16,422
Okay, enough. Let's stop.

1337
01:44:16,559 --> 01:44:18,182
This game is, uh, ridiculous,

1338
01:44:18,321 --> 01:44:20,046

to get some sleep.

Please don't thank me.

It's kind a special right?

1352
01:46:32,731 --> 01:46:34,802
Yeah. It's the island
of the director

-you and Mommy like a lot.
-Yep. That's it.

-Is he alive or dead?
-He's dead.

Did he go to heaven?

Mmm. Questionable.

Dad, there's something
I really want to ask you.

1358
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,335
-Go on then.
-Do ghosts really exist?

1359

-Yes.
-Tell me the truth.

No?

-Yes, they do!
-Or they don't.

1362
01:46:58,481 --> 01:47:01,656
Then why do you
tell ghost stories?

-Moi?
-Grandma said you were

1364

going to make
a movie with ghosts.

1365
01:47:05,902 --> 01:47:07,835
Oh, Grandma said that, did she?
What does she know?

1366
01:47:07,973 --> 01:47:10,182
She read it on the Internet.

Oh, she's on
the internet now, is she?

Yeah. Can you tell me
your ghost story?

It's a zombie story, right?
