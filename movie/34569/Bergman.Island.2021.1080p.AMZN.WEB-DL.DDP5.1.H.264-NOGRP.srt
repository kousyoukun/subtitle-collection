How was his relationship with his children?

150
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,820
在他们年轻的时候，他很少见到他们。
He didn't see much of them when they were young.

151
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,540
说得婉转些，他不是个顾家的人。
He wasn't much of a family man, to put it mildly.

152
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,410
多年来，他的一个女儿
For years, one of his daughters

153
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,440
都不知道他是她父亲。
didn't even know he was her father.

154
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,270
你现在可以坐下了。
[woman] You can sit down now.

155
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,970
然后在他60岁生日时举行了一次盛大的聚会。
Then there was a big reunion at his 60th birthday.

156
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,620
英格丽德说服他邀请所有人。
Ingrid had persuaded him to invite everybody.

157
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,730
英格丽德坚决反对
Ingrid was adamant about

158
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,350
重建伯格曼与家人的关系。
reconstructing Bergman's relationship with his family.

159
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,740
所以，你认为
So, do you think

160
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,430
你可以创造出大量的作品
you can create a great body of work

161
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,640
同时还要养家糊口吗?
and raise a family at the same time?

162
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,570
这么大范围的工作?
A body of work of that scope?

163
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,300
42岁时，伯格曼导演了25部电影，
At the age of 42, Bergman had directed 25 films,

164
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,510
经营一家剧院，上演了许多戏剧。
run a theater, staged many plays.

165
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,310
你觉得他会怎么做
How do you think he would he have done that

166
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,620
如果他还在换尿布呢?
if he was also changing diapers?

167
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,590
你觉得怎么样?-[托尼]实际上，
-How do you feel about that? -[Tony] In practical terms,

168
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,830
抚养9个孩子，导演50部电影，
raising nine kids, directing 50 films,

169
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,800
更不用说戏剧了，这似乎是一项艰巨的任务。
not to mention the plays, seems like a tall order.

170
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,010
是的，但在非实际意义上，
Yeah, but in non-practical terms,

171
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,770
母亲把九个孩子都养大了，他却什么都没做。
the mothers raised all the nine kids and he didn't do a thing.

172
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,290
你觉得怎么样?
How do you feel about that?

173
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,120
-我应该感到难过，对吗?-不。
-I should I feel bad, right? -No.

174
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,330
我在想，这只是因为你太喜欢他了。
It's just because you like him so much, I'm wondering.

175
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,260
是啊，但你也是。
Yeah, but you do too.

176
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,370
的确，女人不可能做同样的事。
It's true that a woman couldn't have done the same thing.

177
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,820
我是说，我想要九个孩子
I mean, I would like to have nine kids

178
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,650
来自五个不同的男人。
from five different men.

179
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,860
这很好。
That's nice.

180
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,690
这只是我
It's just I--

181
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,350
我喜欢某种连贯性。
I like a certain coherence.

182
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,520
我不喜欢我喜欢的艺术家
I don't like it when artists I love

183
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,280
在现实生活中表现不好。
don't behave well in real life.

184
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,660
你有答案了，克里斯。
So you have your answer, Chris.

185
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,320
伯格曼的艺术和生活一样残酷。
Bergman was as cruel in his art as in his life.

186
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,120
正确的。
Right.

187
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,700
仍然……
Still...

188
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,470
[克里斯在刷牙]
[Chris brushing her teeth]

189
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,900
-[水柱]-[受惊的叫喊]
-[water squirts] -[startled shout]

190
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,140
(抑制笑)
[stifled laugh]

191
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,550
[笑]
[laughing]

192
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,760
(克里斯叹息)
[Chris sighs]

193
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,870
[笑]

194
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,320
(小鸟喳喳叫)
[birds chirping]

195
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,850
(鸡叫)
[rooster crows]

196
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,510
(时钟的滴答声)
[clock ticking]

197
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,730
(托尼)嘿!
[Tony] Hey!

198
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,110
我要走。
I'm off.

199
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,120
(在吗?忘记一个面板。
-Where? -Got a panel.

200
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,460
想要来吗?-不。
-Wanna come? -No.

201
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,120
哦。不想去伯格曼中心吗?
Oh. Don't wanna see the Bergman Center?

202
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,640
-我明天再看。-好的。
-I'll see it tomorrow. -Okay.

203
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,950
很好。
Fine.

204
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,960
祝你好运。
Good luck.

205
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,730
(托尼的嗡嗡声)
[Tony humming]

206
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,260
(定时)
[ticking]

207
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
(在德国)
[in German]

208
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
-嘿。——(克里斯)嘿。
-Hey. -[Chris] Hey.

209
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,990
-怎么样?——很好。
-How did it go? -It was good.

210
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,440
人好。很高兴能在那里看到《沉默》。
People were nice. It's great to see The Silence there.

211
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,650
我说得太多了，但是……
I talked too much, but...

212
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,580
你要喝茶吗?-我想要一些。
-You want some tea? -I'd love some, yeah.

213
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,110
6月我想念。
I miss June.

214
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,770
我从你妈妈那拿到一段视频。
Oh, I got a video from your mom.

215
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,500
我没有。
I didn't.

216
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,640
我知道，但那是因为我是她的最爱。
I know, but that's because I'm her favorite.

217
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,470
那就这样吧。
There you go.

218
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,330
[June和奶奶聊天视频]
[June and Grandma chattering in video]

219
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,760
(电视机)
[TV playing]

220
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,310
《木偶奇兵》里的人物，褒曼的铁杆粉丝。
From the Life of Marionettes, pretty hardcore Bergman there.

221
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,180
[克里斯]是的，但这是德国的。
[Chris] Yeah, but it's a German one.

222
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,830
我想看看瑞典的。就像一部夏日电影。
I'd like to see a Swedish one. Like a summer film.

223
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,180
——莫妮卡。-是的,请莫妮卡。
-Not Monika. -Yeah, Monika, please.

224
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,220
不，我见过太多了。
Nah, seen it too often.

225
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,250
——[托尼]排演之后?范妮和亚历山大?
-[Tony] After the Rehearsal? -Fanny and Alexander?

226
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,840
同样的事情。这句话我已经背下来了。
Same thing. I know that one by heart.

227
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,220
第七封印。
The Seventh Seal.

228
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
不，我受不了那个。
No, I can't stand that one.

229
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,090
但这是他最著名的作品，我还没看过。
But it's his most famous one, and I haven't seen it.

230
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,540
-狼的时刻?-不，就是那个
-Hour of the Wolf? -No, that's the one

231
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,540
一个孩子的头被石头砸到。
where a child's head gets bashed against a boulder.

232
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,130
正确的。
Right.

233
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,270
不，如果我们看不到第七封印，
No, if we don't see Seventh Seal,

234
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,750
那至少是一个不错的。
then at least a nice one.

235
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,200
没有这样的东西。
There's no such thing.

236
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,860
然后我们下载一部电影。
Then we download a film.

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,240
你想看珠穆朗玛峰。这是更容易。
You wanted to see Everest. It's easier.

238
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,450
源!-我知道。
-Source! -I know.

239
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,180
萨拉邦德舞。
Saraband.

240
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,700
是的,萨拉邦德舞。
Yeah, Saraband.

241
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,910
-我没有那个。-哦,操。
-I don't have that one. -Oh, fuck.

242
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,910
否则我就有35毫米的照片了。我们之前展示过。
Or else I have a 35mm print. We showed it earlier.

243
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,700
它明天就要回斯德哥尔摩了。
It's going back to Stockholm tomorrow.

244
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,400
什么电影?哭泣和低语。
-What film? -Cries and Whispers.

245
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,780
-你想要一个漂亮的伯格曼。嗯。
-You wanted a nice Bergman. -Hmm.

246
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,880
好吧，你想坐哪儿都行，
Alright, you can sit anywhere you want,

247
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,780
但不是在第一排的那个座位上。
but not in that seat on the first row.

248
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,610
它必须空着，因为这是伯格曼的。
It has to stay empty because it's Bergman's.

249
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,370
-对吗?-谢谢。
-Right? -Thanks.

250
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,510
(风扇转动)
[fans whirring]

251
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,430
(投影仪转动)
[projector whirring]

252
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,260
(钟声间歇性地)
[bells toll intermittently]

253
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,300
(深哭泣)
[deep sobbing]

254
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,970
(继续哭泣)
[sobbing continues]

255
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,900
[女子说外语]
[woman speaks in foreign language]

256
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,290
[电影中忧郁的音乐]
[melancholy music in film]

257
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,190
[音乐继续时无音频]
[no audio while music continues]

258
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,740
就像一部没有精神宣泄的恐怖电影。
It's a like a horror movie without catharsis.

259
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,600
你的意思是?
[Tony] Your point being?

260
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,190
通常当你看完恐怖片后
Well, usually when you come out of a horror movie,

261
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,850
你觉得放心
you feel reassured

262
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,950
因为你知道你刚才看到的不会发生在你身上。
because you know what you just saw can't happen to you.

263
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,020
不是用哭泣和低语。
Not with Cries and Whispers.

264
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,130
孤独，痛苦，死亡的恐惧。
The solitude, the agony, the horror of dying.

265
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,510
事情就是这样。
It's the way things are.

266
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,720
不,它不是。这是一个梦。
No, it's not. It's a dream.

267
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,070
或者更像是一场噩梦。
Or more like a fucking nightmare.

268
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,970
我只希望他的生活比他的电影更有趣。
I just hope he had more fun in his life than in his movies.

269
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,870
我也是。
Me too.

270
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,110
为什么他的角色总是那么糟糕?
Why are his characters always so awful?

271
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,080
为什么他从来没有表现出任何温柔或轻松?
Why doesn't he ever show any tenderness or lightness?

272
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,600
范妮和亚历山大有很多。
There's loads in Fanny and Alexander.

273
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,260
没错，但为时已晚。
True, but that came late.

274
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,910
是啊，不过晚了也挺好的，对吧?
Yeah, but it's good that it came late, right?

275
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,740
他对变轻不感兴趣。
He wasn't interested in being light.

276
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,540
他很黑暗，他想探索这一点。
He--he was dark, and he wanted to explore that.

277
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,820
这对他来说很有趣。
It was fun for him.

278
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,580
为什么他一次也没有
Why didn't he ever once

279
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,030
想探索——
want to explore--

280
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,200
幸福吗?-是的,幸福!
-Happiness? -Yeah, happiness!

281
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,790
我是说，看看这地方。
I mean, look at this place.

282
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,070
他的房子，小岛，美丽的风景。
His houses, the island, beautiful landscapes.

283
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,420
一切都没有他电影里那么残酷。
Everything is less harsh than in his movies.

284
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,590
那就他妈一月再来这里试试。
Then try this place in fucking January.

285
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,390
不了,谢谢。
No, thank you.

286
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,740
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

287
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,710
电影可以是非常悲伤的，
Movies can be terribly sad,

288
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,990
强硬,暴力,
tough, violent,

289
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,300
但最终，它们对你有好处。
but in the end, they do you good.

290
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,750
他不?-不。
-His don't? -No.

291
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,100
只是伤害我。
Just hurt me.

292
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,820
那你为什么还要看?
Then why do you watch them then?

293
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,930
因为我爱他们。
Because I love them.

294
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,140
我只是不知道为什么，就这样。
I just don't know why, that's all.

295
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,740
(喘气)
[panting]

296
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,750
(人)吉娜!
[man] Gina!

297
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,580
(喘息)谢谢!
[gasps] Please!

298
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,890
有人在这里吗?
Anybody in here?

299
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,340
拜托!
Please!

300
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,410
求求你，我有危险，求求你!

301
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,350
有人!

吉娜!

303
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,920
(关于砾石)脚步

304
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,370
(叹息)

305
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,460
(聊天)
[chatter]

306
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,360
几乎结束了。-[托尼]还好吗?
-Almost over. -[Tony] How's it doing?

307
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,570
你再也不看电影了吗?
Don't you ever watch your movies again?

308
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,430
-不。我讨厌它。-伯格曼曾经对他说，地狱，
-No. I hate it. -Bergman used to say that Hell, to him,

309
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,990
如果他要看自己的电影，他会怎么想
would be if he had to watch his own movies

310
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,260
一遍又一遍。我同意。
-over and over again. -I agree.

311
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,570
演职员表刚刚开始，
The credits just started,

312
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,160
-所以我们往里面走。-好的。
-so we move head inside. -Okay.

313
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,550
(低沉的掌声)
[muffled applause]

314
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,310
(欢呼声和功能)
[cheers and whistles]

315
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,900
让我们再次欢迎安东尼·桑德斯。
[Berit] And please welcome again Anthony Sanders.

316
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,360
[托尼]在我的一生中，
[Tony] All of my life,

317
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,910
我觉得我就像在走钢丝，
I felt like I was, um, on a tightrope,

318
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,400
你知道，我一直在平衡，
you know, I was kind of balancing,

319
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,610
如果我掉下来，如果我掉下来，我就
and, uh, if I fell-- if I fell off, I just--

320
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,130
我就会迷失，完全消失。
I'd be lost, I'd be completely gone.

321
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,850
所以，作为一个电影制作人，我只觉得，嗯…
And so, as a filmmaker, only really felt, um...

322
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,790
(如今)
[stammers]

323
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,340
．..安全,我想,
...secure, I suppose,

324
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,790
,和舒适
and--and comfortable

325
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,760
如果故事的中心人物
if the central character of the story

326
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,240
我当时说她是女性。
I was telling at that particular time was, um, female.

327
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,420
那些女人，她们让你接触到现实
The women, they keep you in touch with reality and--

328
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,250
但与此同时，他们也是
But at the same time, they are the ones who

329
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,940
把你拉进小说里。
pull you into fiction.

330
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
你的大部分电影都是由他们主导的。
They drive the action in most of your films.

331
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,430
[托尼]是的，女人喜欢。
[Tony] The women do, yeah.

332
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,810
——[人]嘿。-你好。
-[man] Hey. -Hello.

333
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,300
(安静的聊天)
[quiet chatter]

334
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,700
能把这些给我吗?
Hey, uh, can I get these?

335
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,940
[人]是的,当然。
[man] Yeah, sure.

336
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,950
请800克朗。
800 crowns please.

337
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,810
你输了。
You're lost.

338
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,530
在那里。
Over there.

339
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,670
你必须绕过去。
You have to go around.

340
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,810
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

341
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,200
比比眼镜里的东西怎么样了?
How are things through Bibi's glasses?

342
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,890
——好。——Hampus。
-Much better. --Hampus.

343
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,930
屁股的。-你做住院医生?
-Chris. -You do the residency?

344
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,690
哦,是的。和我的朋友安东尼·桑德斯。
Oh, yeah. Well, with my friend, Anthony Sanders.

345
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,520
——你呢?加了。
-And you? -Me too.

346
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,180
我正在制作我的毕业短片。
I'm working on my short graduation film here.

347
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,040
但我了解法罗。我的祖父母来自这里。
But I know Faro. My grandparents are from here.

348
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,300
我本应该待到八月中旬的，
I was supposed to stay until mid-August,

349
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,230
但我明天要去看我爷爷。
but I'm leaving tomorrow to see my grandfather.

350
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,930
他的死亡。
He's dying.

351
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,370
哦,我很抱歉。
Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,100
哦,他太老了。
Oh, he's old.

353
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,410
我想看看伯格曼的坟墓。
I'd like to see Bergman's grave.

354
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,520
-你知道在哪儿吗?当然,来吧。
-Do you know where it is? -Sure, come on.

355
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
我和我女朋友在哥德堡看了你最后一部电影。
I saw your last film at Goteborg with my girlfriend.

356
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,970
-哦。除了我们，剧院里空无一人。
-Oh. -Besides us, the theater was empty.

357
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,800
后来我们吵了一架，
Then we got in a fight afterwards,

358
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,120
因为我喜欢，她不喜欢。她讨厌它。
because I liked it and she didn't. She hated it.

359
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,460
-我们后来分手了。有关这部电影吗?
-We broke up afterwards. -Over the movie?

360
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
不，不是看电影的时候。
No, not over the movie.

361
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,880
[树叶在风中沙沙作响]
[leaves rustling in the wind]

362
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,020
伯格曼导演了他自己的死亡。
Bergman directed his own death.

363
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,330
他提前决定了一切:
He decided everything in advance:

364
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,820
那个地方，棺材的木头，还有他会穿什么。
the spot, the wood of the coffin, and what he'd wear.

365
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,790
基金会的海达说
Hedda from the Foundation said

366
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,270
在他妻子死后
that after his wife died,

367
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,790
他开始相信有来世。
he started believing in an afterlife.

368
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,550
他是一位牧师的儿子。
He was the son of a minister.

369
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,480
所以，信仰的问题一直伴随着他。
So, the question of faith always followed him.

370
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,660
[说外语]
[speaks in foreign language]

371
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,520
“哦，上帝，你为什么抛弃我?”
[translates in English] "Oh, God, why have you abandoned me?"

372
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,600
但现在瑞典没人真正关心这个了。
But nobody in Sweden really cares now.

373
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,460
哦,他妈的!
Oh, fuck!

374
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,190
我要去伯格曼动物园。
I'm supposed to do the Bergman Safari.

375
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,160
Bergman Safari，你可以跳过这个。
Bergman Safari, you can skip that.

376
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,810
是的，是给托尼的。他不想一个人去。
Yeah, it's for Tony. He didn't want to do it alone.

377
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,610
如果你想看伯格曼的景点，
If you want to see the Bergman spots,

378
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,990
我可以给你看。
I can show them to you.

379
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,510
我还可以给你看其他的。
I can also show you others.

380
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,030
这些是你在Safari上看不到的。
Ones you'd never see on the Safari.

381
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,480
-是吗?-是的。
-Yeah? -Yeah.

382
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,410
——是难以置信的。-哦,谢谢。
-It was fabulous. -Oh, thank you.

383
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,140
对不起，能给我签个名吗?-是的,当然。
-Sorry, can I have an autograph? -Yeah, absolutely.

384
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,140
(聊天)
[chatter]

385
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,110
你是在这儿。-非常感谢。
-Here you are. -Thank you so very much.

386
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,420
这是迷人的。我钦佩你所做的一切。
It was fascinating. I admire everything you do.

387
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,910
-哦,谢谢。我能照张相吗?
-Oh, thank you. -Can I have a photo please?

388
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,910
-我就是喜欢你的工作。-谢谢。
-I just love your work. -Thank you.

389
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,430
小。-非常感谢。
-Keep going. -Thank you very much.

390
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,080
能给我签个名吗?
Can I please have your autograph?

391
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,910
你是我最喜欢的导演。
Your my favorite director.

392
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,020
你就是我开始学电影的原因。
You're the reason why I started studying cinema.

393
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,260
-谢谢。-很高兴认识你。
-Thank you. -Nice to have met you.

394
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,060
好吧。
Okay.

395
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,000
我有一些苹果酒。这是当地的苹果酒。它是美味的。
[Hampus] I have some cider. It's local cider. It's delicious.

396
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,760
在后面。你能打开吗?
It's in the back. Can you open it?

397
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,760
确定。
Sure.

398
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,390
我们要去哪里?
Where are we going?

399
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,950
我想从《乌拉豪》开始。
I was thinking Ullahau to start.

400
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,190
(克里斯)Ullahau吗?
[Chris] Ullahau?

401
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,160
你好,每个人。
Hello, everyone.

402
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,580
我想我们都到齐了，我们可以走了!
I think that we're all here, so we can get going!

403
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,030
我叫费利西亚，很高兴做你的导游
My name is Felicia, and I'm happy to be your guide

404
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,890
参加一年一度的伯格曼野生动物园
for the annual Bergman Safari.

405
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,960
我的两位同事，薇薇安和马肯，
My two colleagues, Vivianne and Majken,

406
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,310
会帮我的

今天天气很好，阳光灿烂，
It is a nice, sunny day,

408
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,900
这是一个很好的优点。
which is a great plus.

409
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,660
对于那些在iphone上下载了应用程序的人，
For those of you who downloaded the app on your iPhones,

410
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,110
现在是时候开始了。
now is the time to start it.

411
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,800
有了它，你就可以跟踪我们的旅程了
With it, you'll be able to follow our journey

412
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,250
在法罗的地图上
on the map of Faro.

413
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,570
现在，如果你们都上车。
Now, if you all come onto the bus.

414
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,740
我之前没介绍你，弗朗西斯科·莫利纳，安东尼·桑德斯。
I didn't introduce you earlier, Francisco Molina, Anthony Sanders.

415
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,470
-你好。快乐。
-How do you do. -Pleasure.

416
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,470
弗朗西斯科在巴塞罗那大学任教。
Francisco teaches at University of Barcelona.

417
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,230
他是昨晚伯格曼测验的当之无愧的冠军。
And he was the hands-down winner of last night's Bergman Quiz.

418
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,820
-哇。-是的。
-Wow. -Yeah.

419
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
我们应当?-是的。
-Shall we? -Yeah.

420
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,370
(聊天)
[chatter]

421
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,590
(汽车引擎启动)
[bus engine starts]

422
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,460
[视频中女子说外语]
[woman in video speaks foreign language]

423
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,320
(安静的聊天)
[quiet chatter]

424
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,780
伯格曼不喜欢那部电影。
You know, Bergman didn't like that movie.

425
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,780
对，所以他们才去了意大利。
Yeah, that's why they went to Italy.

426
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,130
是的。里面有所有的东西
Yeah. it's got all the stuff about

427
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,540
他的个人生活，他的婚姻
his personal life, his marriages--

428
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,470
我们到达了伯格曼拍摄《黑色玻璃》的地方，
We're arriving at the spot where Bergman shot Through a Glass Darkly,

429
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,890
这部电影让他发现了法罗。
the film which allowed him to discover Faro.

430
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,140
起初，伯格曼不想在瑞典拍摄。
At first, Bergman didn't want to shoot it in Sweden.

431
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,960
他想去奥克尼群岛
He wanted to go to the Orkney Islands

432
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,000
在苏格兰海岸附近。
off the Scottish coast.

433
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,040
但生产商认为那太贵了。
But the producers thought that that would be far too expensive.

434
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,180
所以，他们试图说服他改在瑞典拍摄。
So, they tried to persuade him to film it in Sweden instead.

435
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,830
这个地方是1700年左右建成的。
This place came to be around 1700.

436
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,770
人们开始砍伐树木，
People started cutting down the trees,

437
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,870
沙子会从北方吹来，
and the sand would blow in from the north,

438
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,530
在空地上形成了这些沙丘
creating these dunes in the clearings.

439
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,740
Ullahau的意思是“翻滚的沙丘”，
Ullahau means "the rolling dunes",

440
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,810
因为人们认为这意味着审判日的到来。
because people thought this meant judgment day was coming.

441
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,330
他们常说…
And they used to say...

442
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,640
(讲瑞典语)
[speaks Swedish]

443
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,750
也就是说，当乌拉豪山和沙丘相遇时，
which means that when Ullahau and sand high meet,

444
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,100
审判日临近了。
judgment day is near.

445
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,860
然后一个人种了许多新树，
And then a man planted many new trees,

446
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,350
阻止更多的沙子进来。
stopping more sand from coming in.

447
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,490
但是原本就在这里的沙丘却保留了下来。
But the dunes that were already here, they remained.

448
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,090
这让我想去海滩。
This makes me want to go to the beach.

449
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,300
——没有问题。-美丽的沙滩。
-It's no problem. -A nice sandy beach.

450
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,890
有两个海滩，北海滩和南海滩。
There is two of them, the north beach and the south beach.

451
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,890
南海滩很大，海浪很大。
The south beach is large, with big waves.

452
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,830
它更适宜游览的。
It's more touristy.

453
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,800
北方没有游客，没有风，水很清澈，
The north has no tourists, no wind, the water is clear,

454
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,730
-但有很多水母。-不。
-but lots of jellyfish. -No way.

455
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,970
是的，但他们是无害的。
Yeah, but they're harmless.

456
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,670
南方也有一些是毒刺。
And the south does have a few which are stingers.

457
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,460
多,更糟。
Much, much worse.

458
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,950
(聊天)
[chatter]

459
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,750
电影里的房子就在这里。
So, the house in the film was here.

460
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,090
实际上，他们只建造了立面和内部
Actually, they only built the facade and the interiors

461
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,130
大部分是在摄影棚拍摄的。-[男人]房子怎么了?
-were mostly shot in studio. -[man] What happened to the house?

462
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:27,480
嗯，拍完之后他们不得不把它拆掉。
[Felicia] Well, they had to tear it down after the shoot.

463
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,480
伯格曼正在寻找一个小花园
Bergman was looking for a small garden

464
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,250
有老树，这也是他选择这里的原因之一。
with old trees, and that's part of why he picked this spot.

465
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,210
树还在这里，
The trees are still here,

466
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,800
你还可以看到他们拆掉墙的地方。
and you can also see where they took down the wall.

467
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,460
在这里你可以看到墙被替换了。
Here you can see that the wall has been replaced.

468
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,050
一直到…在这里。
All the way to, uh... here.

469
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,090
所以，石头是不同的。这些是他们用过的
So, the stones are different. These are the ones they used

470
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,680
当他们重建长城的时候。
when they rebuilt the wall.

471
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,270
如果你看这里，
And, if you look over here,

472
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,510
你可以看到曾经建过防波堤的地方。
you can see where the jetty once was built.

473
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,650
这就像是防波堤的地基。
So, that was like the foundation of the jetty.

474
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,830
这棵树也在电影里，
And, uh, this tree is actually also in the movie,

475
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,830
但那时它真的很小。
but it was really small then.

476
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,460
所以，它增长了很多
So, it has grown a lot

477
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,010
自从这部电影60年前拍摄以来。
since the film was made about 60 years ago.

478
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,050
伯格曼到达法罗时，发生了一些事情。
When Bergman arrived in Faro, something happened.

479
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,570
这是一见钟情。
It was love at first sight.

480
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,230
伯格曼被这个岛的美丽弄得眼花缭乱。
Bergman was dazzled by the island's beauty.

481
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,920
仿佛他找到了属于自己的风景，
It was as if he had found his own landscape,

482
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,030
一个已经存在于他体内的东西。
one that already existed inside of him.

483
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,510
(温柔的音乐)
[gentle music]

484
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,400
(聊天)
[chatter]

485
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,540
在拍摄《Persona》之前，褒曼曾住院治疗，
Before making Persona, Bergman had been hospitalized,

486
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,200
身心俱疲。
suffering both mental and physical exhaustion.

487
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,890
但在《Persona》之后，他还是一如既往的快乐。
But after Persona, he was as happy as ever.

488
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,890
人物角色体现了这种转变和充实。
Persona incarnates this transition and this fullness.

489
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,860
伯格曼从未忘记它。
Bergman never forgot it.

490
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,730
他说《Persona》救了他的命。
He said that Persona was the film that saved his life.

491
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,560
(鼓舞人心的音乐)
[inspirational music]

492
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,740
是《耻辱》还是《耻辱》?
[man] Is it Shame or The Shame?

493
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,430
在瑞典语中是Skammen，
[Felicia] In Swedish it's Skammen,

494
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,160
意思是"耻辱"
which means "The Shame",

495
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:32,710
但我想英文标题是《耻辱》。
but the English title is Shame,I think.

496
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,710
奇怪的是，在英国它以《耻辱》的名义发布。
Oddly enough, in the UK it was released as The Shame.

497
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,890
(继续播放音乐和聊天)
[music and chatter continue]

498
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,250
伯格曼知道他会受到很多批评
[Felicia] Bergman knew that he would receive a lot of criticism

499
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,560
以这种方式唤起越南。
for evoking Vietnam in this manner.

500
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,730
因为在瑞典关于战争的辩论
Because the debate in Sweden about the war

501
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,220
非常黑和白。
was very black and white.

502
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,740
他的电影非常灰暗。
His film is extremely gray.

503
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,980
(音乐继续)
[music continues]

504
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,400
你看到了吗，水母。
Did you see, jellyfish.

505
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
(喘息)
[gasps]

506
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,440
-[惊声尖叫]-[两人都笑]
-[startled scream] -[both laugh]

507
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,820
(恶心呻吟)
[disgusted groan]

508
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,970
(笑声)
[laughter]

509
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,330
你想买些羊皮吗?
Would you like to buy some lambskin?

510
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,780
嗯…是的。
Um... yeah.

511
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,820
我不能选择。
I can't choose.

512
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,340
我喜欢黑色的，长发的。
I prefer the black, long-haired ones.

513
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,620
但是它们更贵。
But they're more expensive.

514
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,390
(聊天)
[chatter]

515
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,490
是的,完全。
Yeah, totally.

516
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,080
所以,伙计们,伙计们!
So, guys, guys!

517
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,150
我们传统上结束了伯格曼野生动物园
We traditionally end the Bergman Safari

518
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,740
吃一个羊肉汉堡。
by having a lamb burger.

519
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,850
大家都准备好了吗?——[同意]
-Is everyone up for it? -[all agreeing]

520
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,920
-否则你可以吃素食汉堡。——(人)不!
-Otherwise you can have a veggie burger. -[man] No!

521
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,710
包括《狼的时刻》、《耻辱》、《安娜的激情》。
Comprising of Hour of the Wolf, Shame, The Passion of Anna.

522
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,510
伯格曼可不这么看他们。
Uh, you know, Bergman didn't see them that way.

523
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,650
是啊，但是，你知道的，他没有考虑
Yeah, but, you know, he didn't consider

524
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,070
《透过黑暗的玻璃》，寂静与冬日之光
Through a Glass Darkly, The Silence,and Winter Light

525
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,550
作为一个三部曲，然而，一些评论家仍然认为他们
as a trilogy, and yet, some critics still see them

526
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,350
是关于失去信仰的三部曲。
as a trilogy about the loss of faith.

527
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,870
我是说，他肯定说过这是三部曲，
I mean, he definitely said they were a trilogy,

528
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,380
但后来又走了回来。
but then walked it back.

529
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,700
就因为他说这是三部曲
Just because he said it's a trilogy

530
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,040
并不意味着它就是1。
doesn't mean it is one.

531
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,320
是的,当然。
Yeah, sure.

532
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,090
谢谢你的汉普斯狩猎之旅。
Thank you for the Hampus Safari.

我很喜欢。
I loved it.

535

别忘了你的羊皮。
Don't forget your sheepskins.

536
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,870
你查查。再见。
-See you. -Bye.

谢谢你的支持。

540
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,620
我看到那辆巴士，吓坏了。我很抱歉。
I saw the bus and freaked out. I'm sorry.

541
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,380
这是好的。
That's alright.

542
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,070
它怎么样?
How was it?

543
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,970
其实还不错。
It was pretty good, actually.

544
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,700
是的。
Yeah.

545
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,520
但我回来后一直觉得有点恶心。
But I've been feeling a bit yuck since I got back.

546
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,730
-为什么,发生了什么事?-一定是汉堡的问题。
-Why, what happened? -Must have been the burger.

547
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,710
你去哪了?
So, where were you?

548
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,260
开车。
Driving around.

549
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,610
哦,是的。开车吗?
Oh, yeah. driving around?

550
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,680
嗯。我遇到了一个男人。
Mmm. I met a guy.

551
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,200
哦，你遇到了一个男人?确定。
Oh, you met a guy? Sure.

552
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,990
——学生。嗯。
-A student. -Hmm.

553
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,750
-他是学生吗?来自斯德哥尔摩的电影专业学生。
-A student, was he? -A film student from Stockholm.

554
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,480
哦。他帅吗，性感吗，还是?
Oh. Was he handsome, was he sexy, was he?

555
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,170
-是的。-哦。
-Yeah. -Oh.

556
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,620
当他谈到伯格曼的时候，他是不是很聪明?
Was he brilliant when he talked about Bergman?

557
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,310
虽然不像你，但他的笨拙很有魅力。
Not like you, but, um, his clumsiness had its charm.

558
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,520
哦,谢谢。闭嘴。
Oh, thanks. Shut up.

563
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,930
在找什么东西吗?
Looking for something, huh?

564
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,550
-不。-哦。

571
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,900

伯格曼的电影。
Bergman's film.

573
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,050
对不起，我不懂英语。
Sorry, don't understand English.

574
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,840
英格玛·伯格曼吗?
Ingmar Bergman?

575
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,260
那个住在岛上的电影制作人。
The filmmaker who lived on the island.

576
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,190
对不起。
Sorry.

577
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,370
(继续喋喋不休)
[chatter continues]

578
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,580
(瑞典)
[in Swedish]

579
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,200

呵。——(叹息)
-Yikes. -[sighs]

585
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,120
我从《透过黑暗的玻璃》看房子，
I went to see the house from Through a Glass Darkly,

586
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,640
但是我找不到。
but I couldn't find it.

587

——不是。从来没有。-什么?

588
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,060
但是地图上的图片呢?
But the picture on the map?

589

他们建造了立面，然后在工作室里拍摄了内部。
They built the facade, and they shot the interiors in a studio.

590
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,410

591
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,310
(托尼)最近怎么样?你在哪里?
[Tony] How's it going? Where you at?

592
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,140
(叹气)我还在写大纲，
[sighs] I'm still doing the outline,

593
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,660
但我不知道我是否想写。
but I don't know if I want to write it.

594
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,830
为什么不呢?
Why not?

595
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,350
因为我怕这是我已经做过的事。
Because I'm afraid it's like stuff I've already done.

596
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,810
不…不可能的。
No... not possible.

597
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,950
我以为我们花了一辈子
I thought we spent all whole lives

598
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,810
说着同样的话。
saying the same thing.

599
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,670
是的，但角度不同。
We do, but from different perspectives.

600
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,990
你只需要相信你自己。
You just gotta trust yourself.

601
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:29,310
人物，对话，场景，一切都很契合，
Characters, the dialogues, the situations, it all fits,

602
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,860
但有些东西在阻止我。
but something is holding me back.

603
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,410
有些事让我很焦虑。
Something is making me anxious.

604
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,070
那就不一样了。
Oh, well, that's different.

605
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,380
如果这让你感到焦虑，那就休息一下。
If it's making you anxious, take a break.

606
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,870
你刚说了"写"。现在你说“不要写”。
You just said "write". Now you say "don't write".

607
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,840
这没有帮助。这并不容易!
That doesn't help. It's not easy!

608
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,320
你知道写作对我来说有多难。
You know how hard writing is for me.

609
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,560
它是折磨。
It's--it's torture.

610
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,050
这是自己造成的痛苦。
It's self-inflicted agony.

611
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,600
这是石头上流出的血。
It's blood from a stone.

612
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,260
好吧，那就干点别的吧!
Well, then, do something else!

613
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,610
是吗，全职家庭主妇?
Yeah, like what, full-time housewife?

614
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,680
这是一个光荣的职业。
Well, it's an honorable profession.

615
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,760
你知道，写作对你来说没必要这么困难。
You know, there's no reason writing has to be so difficult for you.

616
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,720
你不是15。你已长大。
You're not 15. You've outgrown that.

617
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,590
也许我是，因为我没有。
Well, maybe I am because I haven't.

618
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,390
写别的东西。
Write something else.

619
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,730
我又不是有一堆项目要做
It's not like I have a ton of projects

620
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,530
在我的脑海里排成一行。
lined up in my head.

621
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,670
我真的以为你会鼓励我。
I really thought you would encourage me.

622
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,020
我尝试。
I'm trying.

623
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,920
你知道我喜欢你的作品。
You know I love your work.

624
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,410
你的事情怎么样了?
How's your thing going?

625
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,790
事实上，还不错。
Um, pretty good, actually.

626
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,450
它是什么?
What's it about?

627
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,270
这是,嗯,
It's about, um,

628
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:45,140
看不见的东西是如何循环的
how invisible things circulate

629
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,180
在几。
within a couple.

630
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,390
和这个故事吗?
And the story?

631
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,810
你怎么什么都不告诉我?我什么都告诉你。
Why don't you ever tell me anything? I tell you everything.

632
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,950
-我可不想扫你的兴。-哦。
-Don't wanna jinx it. -Oh.

633
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,050
你能告诉我它发生在哪里吗?
Can you tell me where it takes place?

634
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,260
在这里。
Here.

635
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,330
在这儿?法吗?-是的。
-Here?! Faro? -Yeah.

636
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,270
别说得好像我应该知道似的。
Don't say that like I'm supposed to know.

637
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,750
-嗯，我以为你说了。-不,我没有,
-Well, I thought you did. -No, I don't,

638
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,750
因为你什么都不告诉我。
because you don't tell me anything.

639
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,970
-[托尼]我有头衔了。-嗯。
-[Tony] I've got a title. -Mmm.

640
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,730
你可以保守秘密。
You can keep it to yourself.

641
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,910
(雨声)
[rain pattering]

642
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,790
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

643
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,110
是你的剧本吗?
Is it your script?

644
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,190
琼小姐，你想回家吗?
Miss June, you want to go home?

645
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,260
你确定吗?
You sure?

646
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,060
(悄悄哭泣)
[sobs quietly]

647
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,650
(鸟唱歌)
[birds singing]

648
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,490
(写在纸上)
[writing on paper]

649
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,770
我能告诉你我在写什么吗?
Can I tell you about what I'm writing?

650
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,770
是的。
Yeah.

651
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,920
这是一个更长的故事的最后一集。
It's the last episode of a longer story.

652
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,540
所以，也许它太脆弱了，不够拍电影，
So, maybe it's too flimsy and not enough for a movie,

653
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,270
-但我想听听你的意见。-好的。
-but I would like your opinion. -Okay.

654
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,920
所以它发生了
So it takes place

655
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,270
在婚礼上呆了三天
over three days at a wedding.

656
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,280
我还不知道在哪里
I don't know where yet,

657
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:39,070
但也许像这样的地方。
but maybe a place like here.

658
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,830
像法。
Like Faro.

659
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,910
一个岛屿，实际上会很好。
An island, actually, would work very well.

660
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,320
可以从飞机上开始。
Um, and it could start on the plane.

661
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,700
或者在船上。
Or maybe on a boat.

662
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,640
(神奇的音乐)
[magical music]

663
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,600
[克里斯]我们在波罗的海的渡船上，
[Chris] So, we're on a ferry in the Baltic Sea,

664
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,780
从大陆到哥特兰
from the mainland to Gotland.

665
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,920
要四个小时的车程，而且现在是春天。
It's a four-hour ride, and it's spring.

666
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,650
或许应该是夏天。
Or maybe it should be summer.

667
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,300
这是夏末。
It's late summer.

668
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,000
(聊天)
[chatter]

669
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,930
一个年轻的女人望着远方。
A young woman looks into the distance.

670
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:09,170
她的名字叫艾米。
Her name is Amy.

671
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,760
她和我差不多大，或者比我小一点。
She's about my age or maybe a bit younger.

672
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,630
假设她28岁。
Let's say she's 28.

673
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,180
(音乐继续)
[music continues]

674
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,500
她是这部电影的主角。
She's the main character of the film.

675
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,290
她那天早上从纽约到达了斯德哥尔摩。
She arrived in Stockholm that morning from New York.

676
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,540
她是来参加老朋友妮珂莱特的婚礼的，
She's come for the wedding of an old friend, Nicolette,

677
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,200
她要嫁给一个叫乔纳斯的瑞典人
who's marrying a Swede named Jonas.

678
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,990
庆祝活动在一个岛上举行
The celebration takes place on an island

679
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,130
在哥特兰的北端。
off the northern tip of Gotland.

680
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,370
一个叫法罗的岛。
An island called Faro.

681
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,890
这对艾米来说并非无关紧要
Which is hardly insignificant to Amy,

682
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,310
-因为她是导演。-好的。
-as she's a director. -Alright.

683
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,870
伯格曼在她的想象中占据了非常重要的位置。
And Bergman occupies a very important place in her imagination.

684
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,730
对很多人来说，他是令人敬畏的推荐人，
For many, he's a formidable reference,

685
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,010
但对她来说，他是……
but for her, he is...

686
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,910
一种避难所，一种安慰。
sort of refuge, a consolation.

687
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,360
-嗯。——然而……
-Mm-hmm. -And yet...

688
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,400
但她现在想的不是他。
and yet it's not him she's thinking about right now.

689
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,330
另一个男人占据了她的思想。
Another man is monopolizing her thoughts.

690
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,920
他的名字叫约瑟夫。
Joseph is his name.

691
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,400
约瑟夫，她不能放手。
Joseph she can't let go.

692
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,930
艾米15岁的时候遇到了17岁的约瑟夫。
Amy was 15 when she met Joseph, who was 17.

693
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:19,030
他们像青少年一样热烈而笨拙地爱着对方。
They loved each other passionately and awkwardly, like teenagers do.

694
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,520
他们把对方撕成碎片。
And they tore each other to pieces.

695
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,210
约瑟夫在艾米18岁那天离开了她。
Joseph left Amy the day she turned 18.

696
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,350
他们各走各的路，
They each went their own ways,

697
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,600
但艾米从未忘记约瑟夫。
but Amy never forgot Joseph.

698
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,190
当他们多年后再次见面时，
When they saw each other again years later,

699
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,050
他们意识到他们的感情还在。
they realized that their feelings were still there.

700
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,710
吸引力仍然是压倒性的。
The attraction was still overwhelming.

701
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,260
他们成了恋人。
They became lovers.

702
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,230
他们更成熟，
They were more mature,

703
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,200
更好地理解彼此，
understood each other better,

704
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,550
但情况已经发生了变化。
but circumstances had changed.

705
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,240
他们的生活中再也没有这个爱情故事的位置了。
And there was no place in their lives for this love story anymore.

706
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,420
第一次太快了，第二次又太迟了。
The first time had been too soon, second too late.

707
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:57,830
所以，他们放弃了，不再见面。
So, they gave up and stopped seeing each other.

708
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,420
我希望这部电影是
I'd like this film to be

709
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,390
他们故事的最后一章，
the last chapter of their story,

710
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,290
只是一连串的失败
which was just a series of failures

711
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,390
背叛和戏剧。
and betrayals and dramas.

712
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,430
这是一个不可能的哀悼故事，
The story of impossible mourning,

713
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,980
痛苦，被一些记忆所掩盖
of suffering, overshadowed by a few memories

714
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,570
强烈的幸福感。
of intense happiness.

715
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,720
所以，按照妮珂莱特的建议，
So, following Nicolette's advice,

716
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,890
艾米见了乔纳斯的两个朋友。
Amy met up with two of Jonas' friends.

717
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:25,100
他们从斯德哥尔摩开车去法罗。
They were going to Faro by car from Stockholm.

718
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,720
约瑟夫也做了同样的事，
Joseph did the same thing,

719
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,240
尽管他是从奥斯陆出发的。
though he started out from Oslo.

720
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,900
所以，在分开几年之后，
And so, after several years apart,

721
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,460
这对恋人发现了自己
the two lovers find themselves

722
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,600
坐在汽车后座上
sitting in the back seat of a car

723
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,180
由完全陌生的人驾驶。
driven by total strangers.

724
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,090
薇玛和彼得不知道约瑟夫和艾米的过去。
Wilma and Peter don't know of Joseph's and Amy's past.

725
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,160
他们心照不宣地装聋作哑。
By tacit agreement, they play dumb.

726
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,160
出于害羞，或者作为一种游戏，
Out of bashfulness, or as a game,

727
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,540
他们假装彼此不太熟。
they pretend they vaguely know each other.

728
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,100
这种伪装只会增加艾米的欲望。
This charade only increases Amy's desire.

729
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,960
婚礼后你还会在瑞典呆吗?
Will you be spending any time in Sweden after the wedding?

730
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,000
不，我直接回去。
No, I'm heading straight back.

731
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,520
-我答应过我女儿。-哦,甜蜜的。多大了?
-I promised my daughter. -Oh, sweet. How old?

732
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,350
她是四个。——威尔玛华丽。
-She's four. -[Wilma] Gorgeous.

733
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,110
-[彼得]你呢?-没有孩子。
-[Peter] What about you? -No kids.

734
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,630
我是说，之后你会留在瑞典吗?
I mean, are you staying in Sweden after?

735
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,670
啊!不，我得马上回去。
Ah! No, I have to go right back, actually.

736
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,640
值班电话。
Duty calls.

737
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,850
如果我没有去教堂的领带会有问题吗?
Is it a problem if I don't have a--a tie for church?

738
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,680
我本来打算在机场买的，但是我忘了。
I was going to buy one at the airport, but I forgot.

739
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,990
-没事-我还在想
-No, it's fine-- -I was also wondering,

740
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,100
我意识到我打算穿的裙子，是白色的。
I realized the dress I planned to wear, it's white.

741
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,720
-这是我唯一漂亮的裙子。嗯，通常只有新娘才穿白色。
-It's my only nice dress. -Well, usually, only the bride wears white.

742
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,210
狗屎。-我是说，你得去问妮珂莱特。
-Shit. -I mean, you're gonna have to ask Nicolette.

743
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:42,180
-她可能不会介意。-事实上，我不知道它是不是真的白色。
-She probably won't mind. -Actually, I don't know that it's really white.

744
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,150
更像是米白色或奶油色，有点米色。
It's more like off-white or cream, kind of beige.

745
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,860
(狗叫)
[dog barks]

746
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,560
[约瑟夫]你想去上层甲板吗?
[Joseph] You want to go to the upper deck?

747
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,550
我看了你的电影。
I saw your movie.

748
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,040
哦。
Oh.

749
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,040
你认识那个人吗?
You know that guy?

750
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,520
等等,哪个家伙?
Wait, which guy?

751
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,010
那个扮演我的人。
The one who plays me.

752
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,460
啊。
Ah.

753
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,390
是的。
Yeah.

754
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,390
关于他的什么?
What about him?

755
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,880
我好多了。
I'm much better.

756
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,260
真的吗?以何种方式?
Really? In what ways?

757
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,600
在所有部门。
In all departments.

758
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,740
首先是身体上的。
Physically, to start with.

759
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,440
最重要的是作为一个人。他是个，他是个混蛋。
And most of all as a person. He's a--he's a prick.

760
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,920
该死的。我以为我把你理想化了。
Damn. I thought I'd idealized you.

761
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,200
理想化的吗?
Idealized?

762
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,860
好吧。我希望你是在开玩笑。
Okay. I hope you're kidding.

763
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,140
-我们去过维斯比一次。嘘!
-We've been to Visby once. -Shh!

764
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,420
到中世纪周。
To the medieval week.

765
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,800
-[Amy]什么-他们有一个中世纪主题周
-[Amy] What-- -They have, like, a medieval-themed week

766
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,630
-他们在哪里-你去那里了?
-where they-- -You went to that?

767
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,810
当然。-你有重演吗?
-Of course. -Did you do reenactments?

768
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,500
-[笑声]-[口吃]有点。
-[laughter] -[stammers] Kind of.

769
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,260
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

770
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,880
威尔玛信天翁。我们在这里。
[Wilma] Albatross. We're here.

771
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,030
乔纳斯?
Jonas?

772
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,410
-[微弱的声音]-[薇玛]妮珂莱特?
-[faint chatter] -[Wilma] Nicolette?

773
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,450
(彼得)——乔纳斯?尼科莱特?
-[Peter] Jonas? -Nicolette?

774
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,040
(谈话生长)
[chatter grows louder]

775
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,800
尼科莱特(Joseph) ?
[Joseph] Nicolette?

776
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,450
你看不见我的裙子!
You can't see my dress!

777
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,250
-好的,对不起。-真的?
-Okay, sorry. -Really?

778
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,150
我们发现她穿着裙子。
We found her in the dress.

779
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,880
嘿!你好吗?
Hey! How are you?

780
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,540
(尼科莱特)我很好。疯狂的。
[Nicolette] I'm good. Frantic.

781
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,400
不是太紧张吗?是的,一点。
-Not too nervous? -Yes, a bit.

782
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,470
但是和乔纳斯相比…我可以想象。
-But compared to Jonas... -I can imagine.

783
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,680
-[妮珂莱特]你住在哪里?-我在Sudersand。
-[Nicolette] Where are you staying? -I'm at Sudersand.

784
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,510
——(尼科莱特)你呢?-我在信天翁。
-[Nicolette] And you? -I'm here in Albatross.

785
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,130
-我甚至得到了伯格曼套房。-我非常嫉妒。
-I even got the Bergman suite. -I'm very jealous.

786
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,030
好吧，厕所在花园里。
Yeah, well, the toilet's in the garden.

787
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,690
——如果这能安慰你的话!-好的。
-if that's any consolation! -Okay.

788
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:30,040
(继续喋喋不休)
[chatter continues]

789
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,460
我想我们在下面。
I think we're down here.

790
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,010
—看你。你查查。
-See you later. -See you.

791
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,890
(笑声和交谈)
[laughter and chatter]

792
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,270
我的祖父母在这里长大
My grandparents grew up here,

793
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:35,200
所以我在这里度过了暑假。
so I spent my summer vacations here.

794
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,720
-是的。所以，我了解每一寸土地。-你见过伯格曼吗?
-Yeah. So, I know every inch. -Did you meet Bergman?

795
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,040
伯格曼，伯格曼，伯格曼。
Oh, Bergman, Bergman, Bergman.

796
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,320
为什么瑞典总是褒曼的同义词?
Why is Sweden always synonymous with Bergman?

797
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,730
不,来吧。你要在法罗结婚。
No, come on. You're getting married in Faro.

798
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,350
-这是他的岛屿。-哦,他的岛吗?
-It's kind of his island. -Oh, his island?

799
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,320
我不知道。
I don't know.

800
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,050
你看过他的电影吗?
You've seen any of his movies?

801
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,780
-是的,当然。-是吗?哪一个?
-Yeah, sure. -Yeah? Which ones?

802
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,710
很多人。
A lot of them.

803
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,400
你知道他家在哪吗?
Um, do you know where his house is?

804
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,300
我真的很想看看。
I'd really like to see it.

805
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,230
在清澈的。
It's in Lauter.

806
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,300
等一等。
Hold on.

807
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,270
你能拼出来吗?
Can you spell it?

808
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,520
L-A-U-T-E-R。
L-A-U-T-E-R.

809
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,280
那是主要的一个，他一直住在那里直到他去世。
That's the main one, the one where he lived until his death.

810
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,630
你可以在地图上找到它。
You'll find it on a map.

811
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,530
谢谢。
Thanks.

812
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,250
[模仿伯格曼]我父亲是如此的家长制。
[imitates Bergman] My father was so patriarchal.

813
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:28,640
(假装哭泣)
[pretends to sob]

814
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:33,020
我是说，谁没有父权式的父亲呢?
I mean, who hasn't had a patriarchal father?

815
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,090
我只是想说，伯格曼的日子并不难过。
I'm just saying, Bergman did not have a hard time.

816
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,780
你知道他入伍时发生了什么
You know what happened when he got enlisted

817
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,410
在第二次世界大战期间在瑞典军队服役?
in the Swedish army during World War II?

818
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,650
他得了溃疡。
He got an ulcer.

819
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,860
这就是他得到的。
That's what he got.

820
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,480
[模仿伯格曼]哦，不。又来了恶魔!
[imitates Bergman] Oh, no. Not the demons again!

821
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,870
我是说，谁会因为参加瑞典军队而得溃疡呢
I mean, who gets an ulcer from being enlisted in the Swedish army

822
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,520
第二次世界大战期间?我们是中性的。
during World War II? We were neutral.

823
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,870
[模仿伯格曼]哦，不。我不能参加战争，
[imitates Bergman] Oh, no. I can't fight in the war,

824
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,700
我必须与内心的恶魔斗争
I have to fight my inner demons

825
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,360
因为我爸爸在我们家墙上挂了吓人的画。
'cause my daddy put up scary paintings on our walls.

826
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,220
(嘲笑，正常的声音)来吧。
[scoffs, normal voice] Come on.

827
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,810
好吧，也许有三个评论家认为他…很神奇的。
Fine, maybe three critics thought he was... amazing.

828
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,060
但在你屁眼之外还有个世界。
But there's a world outside your own asshole.

829
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,610
(嘲笑)操伯格曼。
[scoffs] Fuck Bergman.

830
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,030
回答你的问题
Oh, and to answer your question,

831
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,070
不，我从没见过伯格曼，
no, I never met Bergman,

832
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,550
但我祖父母经常在杂货店撞见他。
but my grandparents used to bump into him at the grocery store.

833
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,690
他们觉得他非常讨厌。
And they found him terribly unpleasant.

834
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,040
也许他只是不喜欢去杂货店。
Maybe he just didn't like grocery shopping.

835
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,280
-我要去抽根烟。-是的。
-I'm gonna go for a smoke. -Yeah.

(聊天)

837
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,810
你有烟吗?-嗯。
-Do you have a cigarette? -Mm-hmm.

838
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,370
谢谢。
Thanks.

839
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,610
妮珂莱特，我想问你，
Nicolette, I wanted to ask,

840
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,650
我意识到我打算在婚礼上穿的裙子……
I realize the dress I'd planned on wearing for the wedding...

841
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:55,170
-是的。它是白色的。
-Yes. -It's white.

842
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:59,550
或者是米色的，就像米色。
Or off-white, like a kind of, um, beige.

843
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:01,070
有问题吗?
Is it a problem?

844
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,010
视情况而定。
It depends.

845
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,940
是白色的还是米色的?
Is it white or beige?

846
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,840
(如今)
[stammers]

847
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:13,740
白色的吗?我猜是一个不太老练的人
Off-white? I guess someone without a very sophisticated

848
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,430
细微之处可能会认为它是白色的。
sense of nuance might think it's white.

849
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,090
你没有别的了吗?
And you don't have any others?

850
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,750
我喜欢，只是没那么优雅。
I do, they're just not as, uh, elegant.

851
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:24,930
-我可以借给你。-好的。
-I can lend you one. -Okay.

01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,710
我从没跟我女朋友提起过你，
I never mention you to my girlfriend,

1038
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:50,130
但她嫉妒你
but she's jealous of you.

1039
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,510
只有你。
Only you.

1040
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,610
为什么，还有其他人吗?
Why, are there others?

1041
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,310
有时。
Sometimes.

1042
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,180
你不忠。
You're unfaithful too.

1043
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,210
我爱两个人。
I love two people.

1044
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,560
这是不同的。
That's different.

1045
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,260
我也爱你，但我也爱Michelle，
I love you too, but I also love Michelle,

1046
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,130
我要和她一起做点什么
and I'm building something with her.

1047
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:32,860
为什么是她而不是我?
Why her and not me?

1048
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,480
我不知道，只是…
I don't know, it's just, uh...

1049
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,320
它只是生活。
it's just life.

1050
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:47,420
你有个孩子。
You had a child.

1051
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,610
我想和你一起。
I wanted one with you.

1052
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,610
你想和两个男人同时生两个孩子。
You wanted two children with two men at the same time.

1053
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,240
这是荒谬的。
It was absurd.

1054
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,690
到这里来。
Come here.

1055
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:15,590
别背对着我。
Don't turn your back on me.

1056
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,940
不。
No.

1057
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:28,810
阻止它。
Stop it.

1058
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,540
在你说了那么多之后，我再也不想这样了。
After everything you said, I don't feel like it anymore.

1059
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,880
是的,你做的事情。
Yes, you do.

1060
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,960
(沉重的叹息)
[heavy sigh]

1061
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,910
很抱歉。
Sorry about that.

1062
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,320
我们说到哪儿了?
So, where were we?

1063
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:01,120
我们刚从桑拿房出来。
We'd just left the sauna.

1064
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,020
(托尼)好。
[Tony] Okay.

1065
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:08,470
这时约瑟夫决定去艾米家。
And that's when Joseph decides to go to Amy's.

1066
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:11,160
-你可以想象会发生什么。-对。
-And you can imagine what happens. -Right.

1067
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:14,790
有一次，她穿上了白色的裙子。
At one point, she puts on the white dress.

1068
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,000
-好的。-她想为他穿。
-Okay. -She wants to wear it for him.

1069
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,310
然后，他们再次做爱
And then, they make love again

1070
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,040
一次又一次。
and again.

1071
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,140
然后他们在彼此的臂弯里睡着了。
Then they fall asleep in each other's arms.

1072
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,660
但是当他们离开家的时候
But when they leave the house,

1073
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,770
约瑟夫变得冷漠而疏远。
Joseph's grown cold and distant.

1074

(聊天)

1075

01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,500
显然每个人都知道我们。
Everybody obviously knows about us.

1077
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,190
-是的。我不在乎。
-Yeah. -I don't care.

1078
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:41,430
我做的事。
I do.

1079
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:50,240
你生气了?
Are you angry?

1080
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:51,750
不。
No.

1081
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:53,860
你。你生我的气了。
You are. You're upset with me.

1082
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,070
我生自己的气。
I'm upset with myself.

1083
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,350
同样的事情。

我们所做的是错误的。
What we did was wrong.

1085
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,770
这是一种背叛。
It's a betrayal.

1086
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,530
你处理得很好，但我…
And you deal with it well, but I...

1087
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,220
之后我都不敢看我女朋友了。
I can't look at my girlfriend afterwards.

1088
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,640
我要去换衣服了，我们晚点再见面吧?
I'm going to change, but, uh, we'll meet up later?

1089
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,640
好吧。什么时候?
Okay. When?

1090
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:22,030
我不知道。我叫。

1188
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:56,070
——(女士2)嗨。-你好。
-[woman 2] Hi. -Hi.

1189
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,030
——是吗?好的,谢谢。
-How are you? -Good, thanks.

1190
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:02,900
你看见约瑟夫了吗?
Have you seen Joseph?

1191
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,140
他离开了。——(艾米)他离开?
-He left. -[Amy] He left?

1192
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,180
是的，和威尔玛和彼得一起。
[woman 3] Yeah, with Wilma and Peter.

1193
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,630
他们正乘11点钟的渡船。
They were taking the 11 o'clock ferry.

1194
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,400
嘿。
Hey.

1195
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:20,990
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1196
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,710
(哭泣)
[sobs]

1197
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:27,720
约瑟夫?
Is it Joseph?

1198
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:32,790
还没结束，对吧?
It's still not over, is it?

1199
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,280
[克里斯]艾米回到了桑德。
[Chris] Amy goes back to Sudersand.

1200
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:43,420
一进家门，她就感到自己的不安平静下来了。
Entering the house, she feels her restlessness subside.

1201
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,500
取而代之的是冰冷的悲伤。
It is replaced by a cold sadness.

1202
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:52,160
基本上，这就是我现在的情况。
So, basically, that's where I'm at.

1203
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,780
约瑟的离开了。
Joseph's left.

1204
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,850
艾米的一团糟。
Amy's a mess.

1205
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:57,780
我可以在这里结束。
I could end it here.

1206
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,030
或者艾米可以用裙子的腰带上吊。
Or Amy could hang herself with the belt of her dress.

1207
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:02,510
真的吗?
Really?

1208
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:05,030
或者更引人注目,
Or more dramatic,

1209
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,690
她可以试着上吊自杀
she could try and hang herself

1210
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:09,240
在伯格曼工厂的机翼，然后失败了。
at the wing of the Bergman mill and then fail.

1211
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,380
经典。
Classic.

1212
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:16,080
不管怎样,我……
Anyway, I...

1213
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,800
我不能越过那个点。我卡住了。
I can't get beyond that point. I'm stuck.

1214
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:21,740
你会的。
You will.

1215
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,430
你认为这是一部电影吗?
Do you think it's a movie?

1216
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,670
那得看你自己了。
Well, that depends on you.

1217
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:29,260
我是说，如果你看的时间够长，
I mean, if you look at something long enough,

1218
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,780
这很有趣，对吧?有人说。
it becomes interesting, right? Somebody said that.

1219
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,920
-谢谢。-这很好
-Thanks. -And it's good that

1220
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:35,720
你专注于三天的时间。
you're focusing on a three-day period.

1221
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,410
你以前从来没这么做过。
You've never done that before.

1222
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:38,960
你只需要找到你的结局，就这样。
You just have to find your ending, that's all.

1223
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,450
是的，但我不能。那么，你能帮我吗?
Yeah, but I can't. So, can you help me?

1224
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,550
我对此表示怀疑。
I doubt it.

1225
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:45,450
我觉得我不是那个人
And I don't think I'm the person

1226
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:48,070
-和你讨论这件事。-为什么不呢?
-to be discussing this with you. -Why not?

1227
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:50,630
-你为什么这么想?大便。——(手机铃声响起)
-Why do you think? Shit. -[cell phone rings]

1228
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,360
对不起。
Sorry.

1229
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,390
谢谢你在这关键时刻抛弃我。
Thanks for abandoning me at this critical moment.

1230
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,050
从来没有发生过。
Never happened.

1231
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:05,750
你确定不要我下车吗?我可以乘出租车去。
You sure you don't want me to leave the car? I can take a taxi.

1232
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,750
不，我可以三天没有车。
No, I can be three days without a car.

1233
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:09,540
我要骑自行车。
I'll take the bike.

1234
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,370
你晚上不会抓狂吧?
You're not gonna freak out at night?

1235
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:14,000
我会的，但那是游戏的一部分，不是吗?
I will, but that's part of the game, no?

1236
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,970
如果你太害怕了
Well, if you get too scared,

1237
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,830
去B&B旅馆。
go to the B&B.

1238
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,180
是的。
Yes.

1239
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,940
小心驾驶我们的孩子。
Take care driving our baby.

1240
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,350
刻刻所在之处。-祝制片人好运。
-Always. -And good luck with the producers.

1241
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,870
(温柔的音乐)
[gentle music]

1242
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,300
(音乐继续)
[music continues]

1243
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,170
在那里!
There!

1244
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:11,930
(音乐消失)
[music fades]

1245
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,830
(微弱的古典音乐)
[faint classical music]

1246
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:10,680
(音乐变得响亮)
[music grows louder]

1247
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,960
喂?
Hello?

1248
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,170
喂?
Hello?

1249
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:51,240
有人在这里吗?
Someone here?

1250
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:36,630
你吓死我了。
[gasps] You scared me.

1251
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:39,670
所以你!————它是开着的。
-So did you! -It--it was open.

1252
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,460
我应该从里面锁上门的。
I should have locked the door from the inside.

1253
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,740
这就是规则。
That's the rule.

1254
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:48,300
你回到法罗身边?
[Chris] You came back to Faro?

1255
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:50,470
-我祖父去世了。我很抱歉。
- My grandfather died. -I'm sorry.

1256
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:52,820
所以我回来点蜡烛纪念他。
So, I came back to light candles in his memory.

1257
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,340
我想我应该来这里。
And I figured I'd come by here.

1258
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,030
还有基金会的人
And the people from the Foundation

1259
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:58,130
-让你来来去去?他们认识我。
-let you come and go? -They know me.

1260
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:00,830
我不会带着床头柜离开的。
I'm not going to leave with a bedside table.

1261
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,280
你好吗?剧本有进展了吗?
How are you? Any luck with the script?

1262
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:07,760
我写了一个提纲，但还没找到结尾……
I did an outline, but haven't found an ending...

1263
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,870
然而。
yet.

1264
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,810
这是他的办公室?
This was his office?

1265
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,850
是的。
Yeah.

1266
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,640
[关闭]的音乐
[turns music off]

1267
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,610
我是来听音乐的，
I came here to listen to music,

1268
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,130
然后我就睡着了。
then I fell asleep.

1269
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:30,580
伯格曼家是一个容易入睡的地方。
Bergman's house is a place where you fall asleep easily.

1270
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,170
是这些羊皮长椅。
It's these lambskin benches.

1271
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:48,670
如果你在寻找灵感，
If you're looking for inspiration,

1272
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,980
我推荐在这里。
I recommend in here.

1273
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:53,020
这是冥想室。
It's the meditation room.

1274
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:55,020
也就是英格丽德的房间。
Also known as Ingrid's room.

1275
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:59,540
伯格曼在他妻子死后建的。
Bergman had it built after his wife's death.

1276
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,030
我得走了。我要赶四点钟的渡船。
I have to go. I need to catch the four o'clock ferry.

1277
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,750
别忘了五点之前离开。
Don't forget to leave before five,

1278
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,650
否则闹钟会响的。
or the alarm will go off.

1279
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:07,200
好吧。
Okay.

1280
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,720
谢谢你的提醒。-没有问题。
-Thanks for the warning. -No problem.

1281
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,520
当你离开的时候，
And when you leave,

1282
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:14,000
把门锁上，把钥匙放在门边的箱子里。
lock up and put the key in the box near the door.

1283
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,730
-好的吗?-好的。
-Okay? -Okay.

1284
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:54,600
(钟铃声)
[clock chimes]

1285
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:06,850
-你好,安德斯。-嘿,克里斯。
-Hi, Anders. -Hey, Chris.

1286
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:09,610
有那么一瞬间，我都不知道自己身在何处。
For a second, I didn't know where I was.

1287
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:11,990
一切都搞混了。
Everything was mixed up.

1288
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:13,680
船员离开了。我以为你也走了。
The crew left. So, I thought you'd gone too.

1289
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:16,960
我累了。我，我需要躺下。
I was tired. I--I needed to lie down.

1290
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,520
是啊，我们都精疲力尽了。
Yeah, we're all exhausted.

1291
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:22,140
-但拍摄快结束了。-是的。
-But the shoot is almost over. -Yeah.

1292
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:24,210
你刚到?
You just got here?

1293
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:27,180
不，我在看你拍今天的最后一个镜头。
No, I was watching you doing the last shot of the day.

1294
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,770
我不想离开这个岛
I didn't want to leave the island

1295
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:30,420
没有看到伯格曼的房子。
without seeing Bergman's house.

1296
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:36,600
说真的，你可以在这里给我写个场景。
Seriously, you could have written a scene for me here.

1297
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,600
我试过了。
I tried.

1298
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:42,090
你的角色根本没有理由出现在这里。
There was simply no reason for your character to be here.

1299
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,850
哦。这几乎是5。
Oh. It's almost five.

1300
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:47,790
我们得在马车前离开
We have to leave before the carriage

1301
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,440
变成了南瓜。
turns into a pumpkin.

1302
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,620
你能先带我去图书馆吗?
Will you show me the library first?

1303
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,340
是的。
Yeah.

1304
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,690
跟我来。
Follow me.

1305
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:02,660
一辈子的时间都不够
An entire life wouldn't be enough time

1306
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,420
我读了四分之一的书。
for me to read one-quarter of these books.

1307
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,190
这是我最喜欢的东西。
This is my favorite object here.

1308
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:10,710
这是Dramaten的模型
It's a model of the Dramaten,

1309
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,810
斯德哥尔摩国家剧院。
the national theater of Stockholm.

1310
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:15,050
伯格曼离开时把它给了他。
It was given to Bergman when he left.

1311
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:24,300
他最喜欢的间谍职位是谁?
And who is in his favorite position spying?

1312
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,420
英格玛·伯格曼。——[笑]
-Ingmar Bergman. -[both chuckle]

1313
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,800
(聊天)
[chatter]

1314
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:09,520
有辆车要去信天翁，有人感兴趣吗。
There's a car leaving for Albatross, if anyone's interested.

1315
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,010
我!
Me!

1316
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:13,350
所以，这是再见。
So, this is goodbye.

1317
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:15,290
是的，我明天要早点下班。
Yeah, I'm off early tomorrow.

1318
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:17,530
我想你的妻子和孩子会在机场等着吧?
I guess your wife and kid will be waiting at the airport?

1319
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:19,910
是的。我最好在斯德哥尔摩找些好礼物，
Yeah. I'd better find some nice presents in Stockholm,

1320
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:22,400
不然我还不如坐第一架飞机回去。
or I might as well take the first plane back.

1321
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,370
好吧，你总是可以买到羊皮的。
Well, you can always get sheepskins.

1322
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,230
再见。-好。
-Bye. -Be well.

1323
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:29,200
安全的旅行。再见。
-Safe travels. -Bye.

1324
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:31,580
[克里斯]明天见!
[Chris] See you tomorrow!

1325
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:36,480
最后一场比赛?
So, one last game?

1326
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:37,960
是的。
Yes.

1327
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,420
一支烟，我们就走。
One cigarette and we'll go.

1328
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,570
-回马厩去。-不他妈的。
-Back to the stable. -No fucking way.

1329
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,740
我讨厌这个游戏。我们能停下来吗?
I hate this game. Can we stop it, please?

1330
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:58,920
承认你不喜欢失败。
Just admit that you don't like losing.

1331
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:01,540
你不喜欢事情从你身边溜走。
You don't like it when things escape you.

1332
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:06,580
如果我需要心理医生，你会是最后一个
If I needed a shrink, you'd be the last--

1333
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:09,860
你是我最不愿见的人。
you'd be the second last person I'd go see.

那你为什么要讲鬼故事?
Then why do you tell ghost stories?
