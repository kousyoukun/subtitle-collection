turn left
on "Skarfolksgaten."

27
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,506
No, I didn't add

- In fact, there were two of them

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,180
and I cut it down to one,
so if this...

If their problem is that there's not
enough psychological detail or description,

32
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,103
then it's easy, we just find
someone and they put it back in.

33
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,107
- They put it back in, right?
- I think they'd like to push the shoot back another month,

34
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,274
so we've got time
to figure it out.

35
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,820
Yeah, well, if they push,
they're gonna lose half the cast.

00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,323

I think I left my sunglasses
at the airport.

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,478
Thank you.

45
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,068
[Tony] Wow!

00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,688

00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,901
[Tony] Oh, that has got
to be her.

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,921
- [Ase] You didn't get lost.
- Miracle of GPS.

00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,507
Ah, good, because no one here
would have helped you.

51
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,469
There is a secret pact
between the people

52
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,803
- of Faro and Bergman.
- Good to know.

53
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:14,557
- Ase, nice to meet you.
- Tony. And you.

54
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,849
- Ase.
- Chris.

55
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,476
I take care of the houses.

56
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,978
It's beautiful.

57
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,438
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.
- [Ase] Yeah.

58
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,901
In that house, you'll find
Bergman's private screening room,

59
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,277
where you can see 35mm prints

60
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,197
during Bergman Week.

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,367
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,495
You're free to use
the bicycles.

63
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,540
Oh. Nice.

64
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,709
[Ase] And if you want
to go to Lauter

65
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,877
to visit Bergman's home,

66
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,048
it's a 10-minute
bike ride from here.

67
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,550
[Tony] Fantastic.

68
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,098
- This is the living room.
- Oh.

69
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,558
And this TV,
it's very, very old,

70
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,144
but it works.

71
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,896
This was Kabi Laretei's piano.

72
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,606
His fourth wife.

73
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,735
She was a great pianist.

74
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,863
You'll see, this place
is perfect for working.

75
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,699
[Tony] Sure.

76
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,993
It's a very simple house,

77
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,161
easy to live in.

78
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,872
The bedrooms are upstairs.

79
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,291
The big one was
in Scenes From A Marriage,

80
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,504
the film that made
millions of people divorce.

81
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,257
Oh, I have to show you
for the garbage.

82
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,553
In Sweden, we are very serious
about recycling.

83
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,891
- [Tony] Hey.
- [Chris] Hey.

84
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,982
I can go somewhere else
if you want.

85
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,592
Chris?

86
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,643
Chris!

87
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,901
- Chris!
- [Chris] Tony!

88
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,072
Over here in the mill!

89
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,079
[seagulls calling]

90
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,501
- [Tony] Where are you?
- Hey.

91
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,129
I think I'll be
setting up in here.

92
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,923
We can wave at each other.

93
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,179
Wow.

94
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,143
But don't you think
it's too nice?

95
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,730
Too...

96
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,815
Too what?

97
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,691
Beautiful.

98
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,819
All this calm and perfection.

99
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,862
I find it oppressive.

100
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,449
No. It's soothing.

101
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,742
[sighs] Yeah,
but I didn't realize,

102
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,325
you know, writing here,

103
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,829
how can I not feel like a loser?

104
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,706
I'm even afraid
to sit at a desk.

105
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,876
Well, write outside, then.

106
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,420
A lot of people come
here to work...

107
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,716
students, writers, designers.

108
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,344
No one's expecting Persona.

109
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,221
Yeah, well, thank God for that.

110
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,141
- [shuts window]
- You do realize

111
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,185
we're going to sleep in the bed

112
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,521
where they shot
Scenes From A Marriage.

113
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,315
"The film that made
millions of people divorce."

114
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,777
- I know.
- We have to maybe sleep in the other bedroom.

115
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,863
Separate beds?

116
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,908
Yeah.

117
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,620
[gentle music]

118
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,865
[Tony] Enjoy!

119
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,208
[startled shouting. laughing]

120
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,634
[gentle music continues]

121
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,814
[people chattering]

122
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,898
- Tony.
- Hello. Nice to see you.

123
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,526
- Nice to see you.
- This is Chris.

124
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,776
- Hi, Chris.
- Hello.

125
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,403
And this is Hedda,

126
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,363
who's the head
of the Bergman Foundation.

127
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,157
- And, uh...
- It's an honor to meet you.

128
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,200
- ...Berit, who's in charge...
- Finally!

129
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,661
- ...of the Bergman Week.
- After all the emails.

130
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:13,833
He said it would be easier
to divide up money than homes.

131
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,376
Nine children.

132
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,835
- Nine!
- [Stig] Nine.

133
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,379
- From six different women.
- Wow.

134
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,382
Didn't it bother him

135
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,425
that everything would be
sold to strangers?

136
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,094
He wasn't sentimental.

137
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,429
He lived in the present.

138
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,973
Did he believe in God?
I mean,

139
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,017
it was complicated, I'm sure,
but did he ever talk about it?

140
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,271
He always said that death
was just a light going out.

141
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,482
That changed after Ingrid died.

142
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,818
Bergman believed in ghosts
more than anything.

143
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,403
When you live alone
on a remote island, you know...

144
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,406
He felt Ingrid's presence
in the house.

145
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,866
He said she was there.

146
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,576
He was absolutely
convinced of it.

147
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,998
- [woman] I have a table ready for you inside now.
- [Hedda] Thank you.

148
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,837
[woman] It's right here
by the bar.

149
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,717
[chattering]

150
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,477
How was his relationship
with his children?

151
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,938
He didn't see much of them
when they were young.

152
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,690
He wasn't much of a family man,
to put it mildly.

153
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,526
For years, one of his daughters

154
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,569
didn't even know
he was her father.

155
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,405
[woman] You can sit down now.

156
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,116
Then there was a big reunion
at his 60th birthday.

157
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,785
Ingrid had persuaded him
to invite everybody.

158
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,829
Ingrid was adamant about

159
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,334
reconstructing Bergman's
relationship with his family.

160
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,839
So, do you think

161
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,550
you can create
a great body of work

162
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,802
and raise a family
at the same time?

163
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,680
A body of work of that scope?

164
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,434
At the age of 42,
Bergman had directed 25 films,

165
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,643
run a theater,
staged many plays.

166
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,438
How do you think
he would he have done that

167
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,608
if he was also changing diapers?

168
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,695
- How do you feel about that?
- [Tony] In practical terms,

169
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,946
raising nine kids,
directing 50 films,

170
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,949
not to mention the plays,
seems like a tall order.

171
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,118
Yeah, but
in non-practical terms,

172
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,911
the mothers raised all the nine
kids and he didn't do a thing.

173
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,414
How do you feel about that?

174
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,248
- I should I feel bad, right?
- No.

175
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,459
It's just because you like him
so much, I'm wondering.

176
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,377
Yeah, but you do too.

177
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,504
It's true that a woman couldn't
have done the same thing.

178
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,968
I mean, I would like to have
nine kids

179
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,802
from five different men.

180
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,848
That's nice.

181
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,849
It's just I...

182
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,477
I like a certain coherence.

183
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,645
I don't like it
when artists I love

184
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,397
don't behave well in real life.

185
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,775
So you have your answer, Chris.

186
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:48,488
Bergman was as cruel in his art
as in his life.

187
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,238
Right.

188
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,701
Still...

189
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,456

[Tony] Hey!

199
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,257
I'm off.

200
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,258
- Where?
- Got a panel.

201
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,594
- Wanna come?
- No.

202
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,264
Oh. Don't wanna see
the Bergman Center?

203
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,643
- I'll see it tomorrow.
- Okay.

204
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,936
Fine.

205
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,939
Good luck.

206
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,705
[Tony humming]

[in German]

209
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,640
- Hey.
- [Chris] Hey.

210
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,142
- How did it go?
- It was good.

211
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:13,563
People were nice.
It's great to see The Silence there.

212
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,773
I talked too much, but...

213
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,570
- You want some tea?
- I'd love some, yeah.

214
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,247
I miss June.

215
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,915
Oh, I got a video from your mom.

216
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,625
I didn't.

217
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,629
I know, but that's
because I'm her favorite.

218
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,466
There you go.

219
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:46,347
[June and Grandma

220

[TV playing]

221
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,441
From the Life of Marionettes,
pretty hardcore Bergman there.

222
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,276
[Chris] Yeah,
but it's a German one.

223
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,028
I'd like to see a Swedish one.
Like a summer film.

224
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,323
- Not Monika.
- Yeah, Monika, please.

225
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,324
Nah, seen it too often.

226
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,369
- [Tony] After the Rehearsal?
- Fanny and Alexander?

227
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,953
Same thing.
I know that one by heart.

228
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,373
The Seventh Seal.

229
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,458
No, I can't stand that one.

230
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,210
But it's his most famous one,
and I haven't seen it.

231
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,671
- Hour of the Wolf?
- No, that's the one

232
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,673
where a child's head
gets bashed against a boulder.

233
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,257
Right.

234
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,426
No, if we don't see
Seventh Seal,

235
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:26,885
then at least a nice one.

236
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,180
There's no such thing.

237
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,972
Then we download a film.

238
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,392
You wanted to see Everest.
It's easier.

239
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,602
- Source!
- I know.

240
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,312
Saraband.

241
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,814
Yeah, Saraband.

242
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,024
- I don't have that one.
- Oh, fuck.

243
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,026
Or else I have a 35mm print.
We showed it earlier.

244
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,821
It's going back
to Stockholm tomorrow.

245
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,532
- What film?
- Cries and Whispers.

246
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,910
- You wanted a nice Bergman.
- Hmm.

247
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,995
Alright, you can sit
anywhere you want,

248
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,913
but not in that seat
on the first row.

249
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,626
It has to stay empty
because it's Bergman's.

250
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,503
- Right?
- Thanks.

251

[no audio while music continues]

259
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,881
It's a like a horror movie
without catharsis.

260
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,716
[Tony] Your point being?

261
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,180
Well, usually when you
come out of a horror movie,

262
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,971
you feel reassured

263
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,100
because you know what you
just saw can't happen to you.

264
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,142
Not with Cries and Whispers.

265
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,270
The solitude, the agony,
the horror of dying.

266
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,648
It's the way things are.

267
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,857
No, it's not.
It's a dream.

268
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,193
Or more like
a fucking nightmare.

269
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,113
I just hope he had more fun
in his life than in his movies.

270
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,866
Me too.

271
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,246
Why are his characters
always so awful?

272
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:01,248
Why doesn't he ever show any
tenderness or lightness?

273
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,750
There's loads
in Fanny and Alexander.

274
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,378
True, but that came late.

275
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,046
Yeah, but it's good that
it came late, right?

276
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,881
He wasn't interested
in being light.

277
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,676
He... he was dark,
and he wanted to explore that.

278
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,804
It was fun for him.

279
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,721
Why didn't he ever once

280
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,140
want to explore...

281
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,350
- Happiness?
- Yeah, happiness!

282
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,936
I mean, look at this place.

283
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:25,189
His houses, the island,
beautiful landscapes.

284
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,526
Everything is less harsh
than in his movies.

285
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,737
Then try this place
in fucking January.

286
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,365
No, thank you.

287
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,746
What's the matter?

288
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,832
Movies can be terribly sad,

289
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,125
tough, violent,

290
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,461
but in the end,
they do you good.

291
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,881
- His don't?
- No.

292
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,215
Just hurt me.

293
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,967
Then why do you
watch them then?

294
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,053
Because I love them.

295
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:58,141

that's all.

- Almost over.
- [Tony] How's it doing?

308
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,681
Don't you ever watch
your movies again?

309
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,559
- No. I hate it.
- Bergman used to say that Hell, to him,

310
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,103
would be if he had
to watch his own movies

311
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,396
- over and over again.
- I agree.

312
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,731
The credits just started,

313
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,315
- so we move head inside.
- Okay.

[Berit] And please welcome again
Anthony Sanders.

317
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,462
[Tony] All of my life,

318
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,048
I felt like I was, um,
on a tightrope,

319
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,509
you know, I was
kind of balancing,

320
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,763
and, uh, if I fell...
if I fell off, I just...

321
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,265
I'd be lost,
I'd be completely gone.

322
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,977
And so, as a filmmaker,
only really felt, um...

323
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,937
[stammers]

324
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,481
...secure, I suppose,

325
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:13,940
and... and comfortable

326
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,860
if the central character
of the story

327
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:19,363
I was telling at that particular
time was, um, female.

328
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:23,534
The women, they keep you
in touch with reality and...

329
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,371
But at the same time,
they are the ones who

330
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,081
pull you into fiction.

331
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,208
They drive the action
in most of your films.

332
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,419
[Tony] The women do, yeah.

333
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,953
- [man] Hey.
- Hello.

334
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,290
[quiet chatter]

335
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,857
Hey, uh, can I get these?

336
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,066
[man] Yeah, sure.

337
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,945
800 crowns please.

338
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,938
You're lost.

339
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,690
Over there.

340
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:18,815
You have to go around.

341
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,778
Oh, thank you.

342
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,324
How are things
through Bibi's glasses?

343
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,035
- Much better.
- ...Hampus.

344
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,078
- Chris.
- You do the residency?

345
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,831
Oh, yeah. Well, with my friend,
Anthony Sanders.

346
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,624
- And you?
- Me too.

347
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,294
I'm working on my short
graduation film here.

348
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,048
But I know Faro.
My grandparents are from here.

349
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,439
I was supposed to stay
until mid-August,

350
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,359
but I'm leaving tomorrow
to see my grandfather.

351
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,068
He's dying.

352
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,528
Oh, I'm sorry.

353
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,238
Oh, he's old.

354
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,533
I'd like to see Bergman's grave.

355
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:11,496
- Do you know where it is?
- Sure, come on.

356
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,288
I saw your last film
at Goteborg with my girlfriend.

357
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,125
- Oh.
- Besides us, the theater was empty.

358
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,919
Then we got in a fight
afterwards,

359
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,255
because I liked it and
she didn't. She hated it.

360
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,632
- We broke up afterwards.
- Over the movie?

361
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:26,633
No, not over the movie.

362
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,846
[leaves rustling in the wind]

363
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,171
Bergman directed his own death.

364
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,466
He decided everything
in advance:

365
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,968
the spot, the wood of
the coffin, and what he'd wear.

366
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,928
Hedda from the Foundation said

367
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,389
that after his wife died,

368
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,932
he started believing
in an afterlife.

369
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,684
He was the son of a minister.

370
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,603
So, the question of faith
always followed him.

371
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,774
[speaks in foreign language]

372
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,650
[translates in English] "Oh,
God, why have you abandoned me?"

373
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:27,572
But nobody in Sweden
really cares now.

374
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,574
Oh, fuck!

375
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:34,326
I'm supposed to do
the Bergman Safari.

376
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,245
Bergman Safari,
you can skip that.

377
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,914
Yeah, it's for Tony.
He didn't want to do it alone.

378
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,749
If you want to see
the Bergman spots,

379
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,125
I can show them to you.

380
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,628
I can also show you others.

381
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,171
Ones you'd never see
on the Safari.

382
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,588
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

383
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,548
- It was fabulous.
- Oh, thank you.

384
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,259
- Sorry, can I have an autograph?
- Yeah, absolutely.

385
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,263
[chatter]

386
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,224
- Here you are.
- Thank you so very much.

387
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,558
It was fascinating.
I admire everything you do.

388
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,897
- Oh, thank you.
- Can I have a photo please?

389
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,065
- I just love your work.
- Thank you.

390
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,566
- Keep going.
- Thank you very much.

391
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,236
Can I please have
your autograph?

392
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,028
Your my favorite director.

393
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,155
You're the reason why
I started studying cinema.

394
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,409
- Thank you.
- Nice to have met you.

395
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,078
Okay.

396
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:22,124
[Hampus] I have some cider.
It's local cider. It's delicious.

397
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,918
It's in the back.
Can you open it?

398
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,755
Sure.

399
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,393
Where are we going?

400
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,103
I was thinking
Ullahau to start.

401
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,189
[Chris] Ullahau?

402
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,276
Hello, everyone.

403
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,696
I think that we're all here,
so we can get going!

404
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,157
My name is Felicia, and
I'm happy to be your guide

405
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,991
for the annual Bergman Safari.

406
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:59,120
My two colleagues,
Vivianne and Majken,

407
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,455
are going to help me out.

408
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,206
It is a nice, sunny day,

409
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,999
which is a great plus.

410
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,794
For those of you who downloaded
the app on your iPhones,

411
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:09,213
now is the time to start it.

412
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,965
With it, you'll be able
to follow our journey

413
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,383
on the map of Faro.

414
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,677
Now, if you all
come onto the bus.

415
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,847
I didn't introduce you earlier,
Francisco Molina, Anthony Sanders.

416
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,599
- How do you do.
- Pleasure.

417
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,601
Francisco teaches
at University of Barcelona.

418
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,354
And he was the hands-down winner
of last night's Bergman Quiz.

419
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,981
- Wow.
- Yeah.

420
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,108
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

421
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,363
[chatter]

422
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,579
[bus engine starts]

423
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,460
[woman in video
speaks foreign language]

424
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,340
[quiet chatter]

425
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,883
You know, Bergman didn't like
that movie.

426
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,885
Yeah, that's why they
went to Italy.

427
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,262
Yeah. it's got
all the stuff about

428
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,639
his personal life,
his marriages...

429
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,599
We're arriving at the spot where
Bergman shot Through a Glass Darkly,

430
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,019
the film which allowed him
to discover Faro.

431
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:08,271
At first, Bergman didn't want
to shoot it in Sweden.

432
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,108
He wanted to go
to the Orkney Islands

433
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,110
off the Scottish coast.

434
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,153
But the producers thought that
that would be far too expensive.

435
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,200
So, they tried to persuade him
to film it in Sweden instead.

436
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,941
This place came to be
around 1700.

437
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,900
People started
cutting down the trees,

438
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,987
and the sand would
blow in from the north,

439
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,655
creating these dunes
in the clearings.

440
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,867
Ullahau means
"the rolling dunes",

441
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,952
because people thought this
meant judgment day was coming.

442
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,454
And they used to say...

443
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,625
[speaks Swedish]

444
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,880
which means that
when Ullahau and sand high meet,

445
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,257
judgment day is near.

446
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,967
And then a man planted
many new trees,

447
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,470
stopping more sand
from coming in.

448
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:25,476
But the dunes that were
already here, they remained.

449
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,200
This makes me
want to go to the beach.

450
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:45,411
- It's no problem.
- A nice sandy beach.

451
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:48,998
There is two of them, the north
beach and the south beach.

452
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,043
The south beach is large,
with big waves.

453
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,961
It's more touristy.

454
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:57,923
The north has no tourists,
no wind, the water is clear,

455
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,842
- but lots of jellyfish.
- No way.

456
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,095
Yeah, but they're harmless.

457
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,807
And the south does have a few
which are stingers.

458
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,599
Much, much worse.

459
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,937
[chatter]

460
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,858
So, the house in the film
was here.

461
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,195
Actually, they only built
the facade and the interiors

462
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:23,240
- were mostly shot in studio.
- [man] What happened to the house?

463
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:27,619
[Felicia] Well, they had
to tear it down after the shoot.

464
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,579
Bergman was looking for
a small garden

465
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,374
with old trees, and that's part
of why he picked this spot.

466
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,334
The trees are still here,

467
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,920
and you can also see where
they took down the wall.

468
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:41,592
Here you can see that
the wall has been replaced.

469
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:46,179
All the way to, uh... here.

470
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,224
So, the stones are different.
These are the ones they used

471
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,809
when they rebuilt the wall.

472
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,230
And, if you look over here,

473
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,650
you can see where the jetty
once was built.

474
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:02,780
So, that was like the foundation
of the jetty.

475
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:06,950
And, uh, this tree
is actually also in the movie,

476
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,952
but it was really small then.

477
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,579
So, it has grown a lot

478
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,124
since the film was made
about 60 years ago.

479
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:18,211
When Bergman arrived in Faro,
something happened.

480
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,715
It was love at first sight.

481
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:23,342
Bergman was dazzled
by the island's beauty.

482
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:27,054
It was as if he had found
his own landscape,

483
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:30,017
one that already existed
inside of him.

484
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,521
[gentle music]

485
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,499
[chatter]

486
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,670
Before making Persona,
Bergman had been hospitalized,

487
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,296
suffering both mental
and physical exhaustion.

488
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,008
But after Persona,
he was as happy as ever.

489
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,012
Persona incarnates this
transition and this fullness.

490
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,014
Bergman never forgot it.

491
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,851
He said that Persona was
the film that saved his life.

492
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,563
[inspirational music]

493
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,905
[man] Is it Shame or The Shame?

494
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,574
[Felicia] In Swedish
it's Skammen,

495
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,325
which means "The Shame",

496
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,869
but the English title
is Shame, I think.

497
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,833
Oddly enough, in the UK
it was released as The Shame.

498
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:39,878
[music and chatter continue]

499
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,347
[Felicia] Bergman knew that he
would receive a lot of criticism

500
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:53,682
for evoking Vietnam
in this manner.

501
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,851
Because the debate in Sweden
about the war

502
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:57,353
was very black and white.

503
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:59,856
His film is extremely gray.

504
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,985
[music continues]

505
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,404
Did you see, jellyfish.

506
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,365
[gasps]

507
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,579
- [startled scream]
- [both laugh]

508
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,833
[disgusted groan]

509
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,961
[laughter]

510
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,479
Would you like to buy
some lambskin?

511
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,775
Um... yeah.

512
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,825
I can't choose.

513
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,330
I prefer the black,
long-haired ones.

514
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,625
But they're more expensive.

515
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,379
[chatter]

516
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,630
Yeah, totally.

517
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,215
So, guys, guys!

518
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,300
We traditionally end
the Bergman Safari

519
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,885
by having a lamb burger.

520
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,972
- Is everyone up for it?
- [all agreeing]

521
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:18,016
- Otherwise you can have a veggie burger.
- [man] No!

522
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,853
Comprising of Hour of the Wolf,
Shame, The Passion of Anna.

523
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,648
Uh, you know, Bergman
didn't see them that way.

524
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,775
Yeah, but, you know,
he didn't consider

525
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,193
Through a Glass Darkly,
The Silence, and Winter Light

526
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,697
as a trilogy, and yet,
some critics still see them

527
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,447
as a trilogy about
the loss of faith.

528
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,990
I mean, he definitely said
they were a trilogy,

529
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,492
but then walked it back.

530
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:36,827
Just because he said
it's a trilogy

531
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,204
doesn't mean it is one.

532
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,291
Yeah, sure.

533
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:51,217
Thank you
for the Hampus Safari.

534
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,467
I hope you enjoyed it.

535
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,012
I loved it.

536
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,266
Don't forget your sheepskins.

537
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:11,864
- See you.
- Bye.

538
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,750
- Hey.
- [Chris] Hey.

539
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,003
Très chic.

540
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:31,340
Thanks for the support.

541
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,760
I saw the bus and freaked out.
I'm sorry.

542
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,347
That's alright.

543
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,182
How was it?

544
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,978
It was pretty good, actually.

545
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,811
Yeah.

546
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,646
But I've been feeling
a bit yuck since I got back.

547
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,735
- Why, what happened?
- Must have been the burger.

548
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,699
So, where were you?

549
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,407
Driving around.

550
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,742
Oh, yeah. driving around?

551
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,827
Mmm. I met a guy.

552
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,329
Oh, you met a guy? Sure.

553
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,123
- A student.
- Hmm.

554
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,874
- A student, was he?
- A film student from Stockholm.

555
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:08,628
Oh. Was he handsome,
was he sexy, was he?

556
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,295
- Yeah.
- Oh.

557
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,715
Was he brilliant
when he talked about Bergman?

558
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:15,467
Not like you, but, um,
his clumsiness had its charm.

559
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,514
Oh, thanks. Shut up.

560
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,068
[printer whirring]

561
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:41,453

[ticking stops]

[footsteps approaching]

564
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:25,934
Looking for something, huh?

565
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,520
- No.
- Oh.

566
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,405

[music continues]

570
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:17,376
Hey. Hi.

571
00:47:17,378 --> 00:47:18,670
I'm looking for the house

572
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,046
from Through a Glass Darkly.

573
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:23,134
Bergman's film.

574
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:27,177
Sorry, don't understand English.

575
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:29,807
Ingmar Bergman?

576
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:33,434
The filmmaker
who lived on the island.

577
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:35,188
Sorry.

578
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:38,358
[chatter continues]

579
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:40,568
[in Swedish]

580
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,200
[Chris] Oh, come on.

581
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:53,579
[thunder rumbles]

582
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,500
[rain pouring]

583
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:03,257
[thunder crashing]

584
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:29,826
- [footsteps approaching]
- You want to have lunch?

585
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,748
- Yikes.
- [sighs]

586
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:43,253
I went to see the house from
Through a Glass Darkly,

587
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:44,755
but I couldn't find it.

588
00:48:44,757 --> 00:48:47,215
- There isn't one. Never was.
- What?

589
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,177
But the picture on the map?

590
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,514
They built the facade, and they
shot the interiors in a studio.

591
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:54,391
Bergman Safari, babes.

592
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:59,436
[Tony] How's it going?
Where you at?

593
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:01,271
[sighs] I'm still
doing the outline,

594
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:03,816
but I don't know
if I want to write it.

595
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:05,943
Why not?

596
00:49:05,945 --> 00:49:08,487
Because I'm afraid it's
like stuff I've already done.

597
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:11,907
No... not possible.

598
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:13,075
I thought we spent
all whole lives

599
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:14,911
saying the same thing.

600
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:17,829
We do, but from
different perspectives.

601
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,999
You just gotta trust yourself.

602
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:29,425
Characters, the dialogues,
the situations, it all fits,

603
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:32,010
but something
is holding me back.

604
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,554
Something is making me anxious.

605
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:35,222
Oh, well, that's different.

606
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:38,517
If it's making you anxious,
take a break.

607
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,019
You just said "write".
Now you say "don't write".

608
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,938
That doesn't help.
It's not easy!

609
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,440
You know how hard
writing is for me.

610
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:45,691
It's... it's torture.

611
00:49:45,693 --> 00:49:47,193
It's self-inflicted agony.

612
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:48,735
It's blood from a stone.

613
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:53,407
Well, then, do something else!

614
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:55,742
Yeah, like what,
full-time housewife?

615
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:57,663
Well, it's an honorable
profession.

616
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,878
You know, there's no reason writing
has to be so difficult for you.

617
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,840
You're not 15.
You've outgrown that.

618
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,594
Well, maybe I am
because I haven't.

619
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:16,514
Write something else.

620
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:17,889
It's not like I have
a ton of projects

621
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,518
lined up in my head.

622
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,813
I really thought
you would encourage me.

623
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:24,983
I'm trying.

624
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,902
You know I love your work.

625
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,532
How's your thing going?

626
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:36,786
Um, pretty good, actually.

627
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,579
What's it about?

628
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:41,414
It's about, um,

629
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:45,293
how invisible things circulate

630
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,172
within a couple.

631
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:50,382
And the story?

632
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:55,927
Why don't you ever tell me anything?
I tell you everything.

633
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,931
- Don't wanna jinx it.
- Oh.

634
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:02,184
Can you tell me
where it takes place?

635
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,394
Here.

636
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:05,479
- Here?! Faro?
- Yeah.

637
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:07,398
Don't say that like
I'm supposed to know.

638
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,858
- Well, I thought you did.
- No, I don't,

639
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,737
because
you don't tell me anything.

640
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,119
- [Tony] I've got a title.
- Mmm.

641
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:22,706
You can keep it to yourself.

642
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,876
[rain pattering]

643
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:50,777
What's the matter?

644
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:59,119
Is it your script?

645
00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:12,338
Miss June, you want to go home?

646
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,259
You sure?

647
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:20,056
[sobs quietly]

648
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,644
[birds singing]

649
00:52:34,445 --> 00:52:36,489
[writing on paper]

650
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:14,941
Can I tell you about
what I'm writing?

651
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:16,779
Yeah.

652
00:53:18,364 --> 00:53:21,032
It's the last episode
of a longer story.

653
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,659
So, maybe it's too flimsy
and not enough for a movie,

654
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:26,412
- but I would like your opinion.
- Okay.

655
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:29,039
So it takes place

656
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:32,295
over three days at a wedding.

657
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:35,420
I don't know where yet,

658
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:39,217
but maybe a place like here.

659
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,967
Like Faro.

660
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:44,012
An island, actually,
would work very well.

661
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:47,474
Um, and it could
start on the plane.

662
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:49,851
Or maybe on a boat.

663
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,771
[magical music]

664
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:53,731
[Chris] So, we're on a ferry
in the Baltic Sea,

665
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,900
from the mainland to Gotland.

666
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:59,028
It's a four-hour ride,
and it's spring.

667
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,780
Or maybe it should be summer.

668
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:03,449
It's late summer.

669
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:05,117
[chatter]

670
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,077
A young woman
looks into the distance.

671
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,287
Her name is Amy.

672
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:12,874
She's about my age
or maybe a bit younger.

673
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:15,753
Let's say she's 28.

674
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:19,298
[music continues]

675
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,594
She's the main character
of the film.

676
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:26,389
She arrived in Stockholm
that morning from New York.

677
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,682
She's come for the wedding
of an old friend, Nicolette,

678
00:54:28,684 --> 00:54:33,311
who's marrying a Swede
named Jonas.

679
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:35,106
The celebration takes place
on an island

680
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:37,275
off the northern tip
of Gotland.

681
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,526
An island called Faro.

682
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:42,030
Which is hardly
insignificant to Amy,

683
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:44,407
- as she's a director.
- Alright.

684
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:47,994
And Bergman occupies a very
important place in her imagination.

685
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,871
For many,
he's a formidable reference,

686
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:53,124
but for her, he is...

687
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:56,043
sort of refuge, a consolation.

688
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:58,463
- Mm-hmm.
- And yet...

689
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:01,507
and yet it's not him she's
thinking about right now.

690
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:04,469
Another man
is monopolizing her thoughts.

691
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,054
Joseph is his name.

692
00:55:07,056 --> 00:55:09,514
Joseph she can't let go.

693
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:14,019
Amy was 15 when she met Joseph,
who was 17.

694
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:19,150
They loved each other passionately
and awkwardly, like teenagers do.

695
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:21,651
And they tore each other
to pieces.

696
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:25,199
Joseph left Amy the day
she turned 18.

697
00:55:26,784 --> 00:55:28,492
They each went
their own ways,

698
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:30,744
but Amy never forgot Joseph.

699
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:33,289
When they saw each other again
years later,

700
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:36,166
they realized that their
feelings were still there.

701
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:38,712
The attraction
was still overwhelming.

702
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:41,421
They became lovers.

703
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,383
They were more mature,

704
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:45,342
understood each other better,

705
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:47,637
but circumstances had changed.

706
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:50,347
And there was no place in their
lives for this love story anymore.

707
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:54,519
The first time had been
too soon, second too late.

708
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:57,816
So, they gave up and
stopped seeing each other.

709
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:01,566
I'd like this film to be

710
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,485
the last chapter
of their story,

711
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:05,445
which was just a series
of failures

712
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:07,532
and betrayals and dramas.

713
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,534
The story
of impossible mourning,

714
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:12,119
of suffering, overshadowed
by a few memories

715
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:14,581
of intense happiness.

716
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:18,834
So, following
Nicolette's advice,

717
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:22,005
Amy met up with
two of Jonas' friends.

718
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,215
They were going to Faro by car
from Stockholm.

719
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:26,842
Joseph did the same thing,

720
00:56:26,844 --> 00:56:30,345
though he started out
from Oslo.

721
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:34,016
And so, after
several years apart,

722
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:35,601
the two lovers find themselves

723
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:37,729
sitting in the back seat
of a car

724
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:40,313
driven by total strangers.

725
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:45,193
Wilma and Peter don't know
of Joseph's and Amy's past.

726
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:47,280
By tacit agreement,
they play dumb.

727
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:50,282
Out of bashfulness,
or as a game,

728
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:54,662
they pretend they vaguely
know each other.

729
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:58,206
This charade only increases
Amy's desire.

730
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:01,084
Will you be spending any time
in Sweden after the wedding?

731
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:03,128
No, I'm heading straight back.

732
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,673
- I promised my daughter.
- Oh, sweet. How old?

733
00:57:05,675 --> 00:57:08,508
- She's four.
- [Wilma] Gorgeous.

734
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,220
- [Peter] What about you?
- No kids.

735
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:13,764
I mean, are you staying
in Sweden after?

736
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:17,809
Ah! No, I have to go
right back, actually.

737
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:19,646
Duty calls.

738
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,983
Is it a problem if I don't have
a... a tie for church?

739
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:27,820
I was going to buy one
at the airport, but I forgot.

740
00:57:27,822 --> 00:57:30,113
- No, it's fine...
- I was also wondering,

741
00:57:30,115 --> 00:57:33,200
I realized the dress
I planned to wear, it's white.

742
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:36,829
- It's my only nice dress.
- Well, usually, only the bride wears white.

743
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:39,331
- Shit.
- I mean, you're gonna have to ask Nicolette.

744
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:42,293
- She probably won't mind.
- Actually, I don't know that it's really white.

745
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:47,133
It's more like off-white
or cream, kind of beige.

746
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:11,865
[dog barks]

747
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,578
[Joseph] You want to go
to the upper deck?

748
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,691
I saw your movie.

749
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:48,150
Oh.

750
00:58:48,152 --> 00:58:50,193
You know that guy?

751
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:51,653
Wait, which guy?

752
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:53,155
The one who plays me.

753
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:54,615
Ah.

754
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:56,534
Yeah.

755
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:57,534
What about him?

756
00:58:57,536 --> 00:58:58,994
I'm much better.

757
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:01,414
Really? In what ways?

758
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,749
In all departments.

759
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:05,876
Physically, to start with.

760
00:59:05,878 --> 00:59:08,588
And most of all as a person.
He's a... he's a prick.

761
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,048
Damn. I thought
I'd idealized you.

762
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,177
Idealized?

763
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:15,846
Okay. I hope you're kidding.

764
00:59:20,851 --> 00:59:23,311
- We've been to Visby once.
- Shh!

765
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:26,521
To the medieval week.

766
00:59:26,523 --> 00:59:28,941
- [Amy] What...
- They have, like, a medieval-themed week

767
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:30,776
- where they...
- You went to that?

768
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:32,945
- Of course.
- Did you do reenactments?

769
00:59:32,947 --> 00:59:35,655
- [laughter]
- [stammers] Kind of.

770
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:37,367
What do you mean?

771
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:40,872
[Wilma] Albatross.
We're here.

772
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:50,170
Jonas?

773
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:52,548
- [faint chatter]
- [Wilma] Nicolette?

774
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,592
- [Peter] Jonas?
- Nicolette?

775
00:59:55,594 --> 00:59:58,179
[chatter grows louder]

776
00:59:58,181 --> 00:59:59,930
[Joseph] Nicolette?

777
00:59:59,932 --> 01:00:01,599
You can't see my dress!

778
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:04,229
- Okay, sorry.
- Really?

779
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:09,150
We found her in the dress.

780
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:12,025
Hey! How are you?

781
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:13,695
[Nicolette] I'm good. Frantic.

782
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,530
- Not too nervous?
- Yes, a bit.

783
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,572
- But compared to Jonas...
- I can imagine.

784
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:19,825
- [Nicolette] Where are you staying?
- I'm at Sudersand.

785
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:21,619
- [Nicolette] And you?
- I'm here in Albatross.

786
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:23,246
- I even got the Bergman suite.
- I'm very jealous.

787
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,164
Yeah, well,
the toilet's in the garden.

788
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,833
- if that's any consolation!
- Okay.

789
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:30,045
[chatter continues]

790
01:00:38,387 --> 01:00:40,431
I think we're down here.

791
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:43,018
- See you later.
- See you.

792
01:01:27,311 --> 01:01:29,897
[laughter and chatter]

793
01:01:30,898 --> 01:01:32,398
My grandparents grew up here,

794
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,318
so I spent my summer
vacations here.

795
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,862
- Yeah. So, I know every inch.
- Did you meet Bergman?

796
01:01:38,864 --> 01:01:41,157
Oh, Bergman, Bergman, Bergman.

797
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:43,450
Why is Sweden always
synonymous with Bergman?

798
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:45,869
No, come on.
You're getting married in Faro.

799
01:01:45,871 --> 01:01:48,498
- It's kind of his island.
- Oh, his island?

800
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,458

- Hi, Anders.
- Hey, Chris.

1287
01:41:06,983 --> 01:41:09,776
For a second,
I didn't know where I was.

1288
01:41:09,778 --> 01:41:12,111
Everything was mixed up.

1289
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:13,821
The crew left.
So, I thought you'd gone too.

1290
01:41:13,823 --> 01:41:17,116
I was tired.
I... I needed to lie down.

1291
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:19,660
Yeah, we're all exhausted.

1292
01:41:19,662 --> 01:41:22,287
- But the shoot is almost over.
- Yeah.

1293
01:41:22,289 --> 01:41:24,331
You just got here?

1294
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:27,335
No, I was watching you doing
the last shot of the day.

1295
01:41:27,337 --> 01:41:28,919
I didn't want to leave
the island

1296
01:41:28,921 --> 01:41:30,422
without seeing Bergman's house.

1297
01:41:33,885 --> 01:41:36,760
Seriously, you could have
written a scene for me here.

1298
01:41:36,762 --> 01:41:38,720
I tried.

1299
01:41:38,722 --> 01:41:42,101
There was simply no reason
for your character to be here.

1300
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:45,977
Oh. It's almost five.

1301
01:41:45,979 --> 01:41:47,938
We have to leave
before the carriage

1302
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,565
turns into a pumpkin.

1303
01:41:49,567 --> 01:41:51,776
Will you show me
the library first?

1304
01:41:51,778 --> 01:41:53,363
Yeah.

1305
01:41:54,322 --> 01:41:55,699
Follow me.

1306
01:42:00,994 --> 01:42:02,786
An entire life
wouldn't be enough time

1307
01:42:02,788 --> 01:42:05,416
for me to read
one-quarter of these books.

1308
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:09,335
This is my favorite object here.

1309
01:42:09,337 --> 01:42:10,836
It's a model of the Dramaten,

1310
01:42:10,838 --> 01:42:12,921
the national theater
of Stockholm.

1311
01:42:12,923 --> 01:42:15,051
It was given to Bergman
when he left.

1312
01:42:20,515 --> 01:42:24,310
And who is in his favorite
position spying?

1313
01:42:31,025 --> 01:42:33,567
- Ingmar Bergman.
- [both chuckle]

[chatter]

1315
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:09,687
There's a car leaving for
Albatross, if anyone's interested.

1316
01:43:09,689 --> 01:43:11,147
Me!

1317
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:13,482
So, this is goodbye.

1318
01:43:13,484 --> 01:43:15,401
Yeah, I'm off early tomorrow.

1319
01:43:15,403 --> 01:43:17,652
I guess your wife and kid
will be waiting at the airport?

1320
01:43:17,654 --> 01:43:20,031
Yeah. I'd better find some nice
presents in Stockholm,

1321
01:43:20,033 --> 01:43:22,532
or I might as well
take the first plane back.

1322
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:24,494
Well, you can always
get sheepskins.

1323
01:43:24,496 --> 01:43:27,371
- Bye.
- Be well.

1324
01:43:27,373 --> 01:43:29,331
- Safe travels.
- Bye.

1325
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:31,586
[Chris] See you tomorrow!

1326
01:43:34,171 --> 01:43:36,630
So, one last game?

1327
01:43:36,632 --> 01:43:38,132
Yes.

1328
01:43:38,134 --> 01:43:40,427
One cigarette and we'll go.

1329
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:52,688
- Back to the stable.
- No fucking way.

1330
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:55,857
I hate this game.
Can we stop it, please?

1331
01:43:55,859 --> 01:43:59,027
Just admit that
you don't like losing.

1332
01:43:59,029 --> 01:44:01,532
You don't like it
when things escape you.

1333
01:44:03,033 --> 01:44:06,702
If I needed a shrink,
you'd be the last...

1334
01:44:06,704 --> 01:44:09,998
you'd be the second last person
I'd go see.

1335
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,083
- Who'd be the last?
- My mother.

1336
01:44:12,085 --> 01:44:14,335
- [chuckles]
- Oh, fuck.

1337
01:44:14,337 --> 01:44:16,545
Okay, enough. Let's stop.

1338
01:44:16,547 --> 01:44:18,296
This game is, uh, ridiculous,

1339
01:44:18,298 --> 01:44:20,174
and I really need
to get some sleep.

in four hours.

to say goodbye?

1342
01:44:41,864 --> 01:44:43,198

Please don't thank me.

1346
01:45:23,614 --> 01:45:25,656
You should get some sleep.

You have to be in shape
tomorrow.

- Yeah!

1352
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:32,723
So, you know this island.
It's kind a special right?

1353
01:46:32,725 --> 01:46:34,933
Yeah. It's the island
of the director

1354
01:46:34,935 --> 01:46:38,187
- you and Mommy like a lot.
- Yep. That's it.

1355
01:46:38,189 --> 01:46:40,982
- Is he alive or dead?
- He's dead.

1356
01:46:40,984 --> 01:46:42,736
Did he go to heaven?

1357
01:46:43,903 --> 01:46:45,864
Mmm. Questionable.

1358
01:46:47,489 --> 01:46:49,906
Dad, there's something
I really want to ask you.

1359
01:46:49,908 --> 01:46:52,492
- Go on then.
- Do ghosts really exist?

1360
01:46:52,494 --> 01:46:54,911
- Yes.
- Tell me the truth.

1361
01:46:54,913 --> 01:46:56,246
No?

1362
01:46:56,248 --> 01:46:58,499
- Yes, they do!
- Or they don't.

1363
01:46:58,501 --> 01:47:01,794
Then why do you
tell ghost stories?

1364
01:47:01,796 --> 01:47:03,838
- Moi?
- Grandma said you were

1365
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,882
going to make
a movie with ghosts.

1366
01:47:05,884 --> 01:47:07,967
Oh, Grandma said that, did she?
What does she know?

1367
01:47:07,969 --> 01:47:10,303
She read it on the Internet.

1368
01:47:10,305 --> 01:47:11,928
Oh, she's on
the internet now, is she?

1369
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:14,639
Yeah. Can you tell me
your ghost story?

1370
01:47:14,641 --> 01:47:16,894
It's a zombie story, right?

Zombies.
And there's this monster.

from his eyes.

and you look real hard,
I think you might find your mom.
