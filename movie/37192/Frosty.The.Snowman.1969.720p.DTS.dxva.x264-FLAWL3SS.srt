I suppose it all started with the snow.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,500
You see, it's a very special kind of snow.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,800
A snow to make the happy
happier and the giddy even giddier.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,300
A snow to make a homecoming homier

and natural enemies friends, naturally.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,900
For it was the first
snow of the season.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,300
And as any child can tell you, there's a
certain magic to the very first snow...

the day before Christmas.

For when the first snow
is also a Christmas snow,

is bound to happen![Laughing]

Hinkle, the magician,

15

to entertain at today's class
Christmas party, so pay attention!

16

Now, Professor Hinkle was just
about the worst magician in the world.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,900
And so, I put the magic eggs in to my hat.

18

Abracadabra, to coin a phrase... [Laugh]

19

We're building a snowman, Karen.
You make the head!

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
The head is the most difficult part,
ask anyone!

31

What will we call him?
Should we call him Harold? Nah.

Come back here, you!

Happy Birthday!

43
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,100
That hat brought Frosty to life.
It must be magic.

44

Magic? My hat, magic?

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,300
Just look.

If that hat is magic, I want it back.

But it's not yours anymore!
You threw it away!

Don't talk back to your elders,
you naughty naughty little girl.

49

And you, stay in there, or
there will be no carrots for Christmas.

50

But you can't take that hat back,
it brought Frosty to life

You saw it happen!
I saw nothing of the kind.

It'll make me a billionaire magician!

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But we saw Frosty come to life,
didn't we? Uh-huh, we sure did.

57
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,000
You silly children believe
everything you see.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,500
When you're grown up you'll realize
that snowmen can't come to life.

But we -

Aw, Frosty, we don't care what grown-ups
say, we know you DID come to life.

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,000
We know, Frosty. We just know.

He was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day.

67
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,300
Now, of course, the hat did belong to
Frosty and the children.

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,700
That part must be made very clear.

Therefore, Hocus Pocus was entirely in
the right in what he was about to do.

But snowmen can't talk.

Alright, come on now, what's the joke.
Could I really be alive?

sweep, I can count to 10.

getting red. I hate red thermometers.

Why, Frosty?

91
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
'Cause when the thermometer gets
all reddish, the temperature goes up.

92
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,800
And when the temperature goes up,
I start to melt. And when I start to melt...

place where you'll never melt.

melt is the north pole.

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,700
[Sneeze] Are you cold, Karen?

10
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,300
Now that's a silly question.

11
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,600
You wouldn't be sneezing
if you weren't cold.

12
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,000
Well... just... just a lit... little.
[Sneeze]

13
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Frosty realized that Karen had to
get out of that car as soon as possible.

14
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,200
So when the little
freight train stopped to

15
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,500
let an express full of happy
Christmas travelers pass,

16
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Frosty took advantage of the
opportunity and quickly got them all off.

17
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, you tricked me! No fair!

18
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,700
The only thing professor Hinkle
could do was make a jump for it.

19
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,500
[Bonk, Ping, Tinkle, Scrabble, Doink]

20
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,900
[Howling wind]

21
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,600
Frosty wanted to get as far away
as he could before Hinkle woke up.

22
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,400
[Hocus' teeth chatter]

23
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,000
[Sneeze]

24
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,600
But the woods through which
they traveled were still bitterly cold.

25
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Hocus, I've got to get Karen
all warmed up or she's a gonner!

26
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,800
I can't make a fire. Oh boy,
that's one thing I really can't do.

27
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,000
I guess we just better keep
moving until we find somebody who can.

28
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,800
Then suddenly they came upon a
tiny glen which seemed almost magical.

29
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,500
For it was Christmas
eve and the woodland

30
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,800
animals were all decorating
for their big celebration.

31
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,600
They knew Santa was to come that night

32
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,700
and they wanted everything
to be just right.

33
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Hocus, speak to the animals.

34
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,500
See if they won't all pitch
in and build a fire for Karen.

35
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,900
[Squeaky noises]

36
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,900
The animals were delighted to help.

37
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,000
so they found a spot away from the glen

38
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
where the fire wouldn't
catch on to the trees.

39
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,700
Soon there was a spark and in almost

40
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,200
no time a splendid
fire was crackling away.

41
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,300
Frosty was careful to stay
far away from the flames.

42
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,300
Hocus, we've got to find someone
to help Karen get home before she freezes.

43
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
And me to the north pole
before I melt, but who?

44
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,100
No, not the Marines.

45
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
No, not the president of the United States.

46
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Oh, they were both swell ideas,
but we've got to find someone nearby.

47
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Yeah, Santa Claus. That's a great idea.
Why didn't I think of that before?

48
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,300
Hocus, you go back with the animals and
when Santa comes, you bring him right here.

49
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,400
Understand?

50
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,900
Hurry now!

51
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,200
So Frosty kept a silent vigil,

52
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,400
waiting patiently all through the
night until Santa would arrive.

53
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,600
But suddenly...

54
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,400
Oh, a campfire.

55
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Well isn't that all snug and comfy?
[Evil laughter]

56
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
[Professor Hinkle blows]

57
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,600
No! Don't!

58
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,700
Now give me that hat or else!

59
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
Or else what?

60
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Well don't bother me with details,
give me that hat!

61
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,200
Get on my shoulders, Karen!

62
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
You see, Frosty, since
he was made of snow

63
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
himself was the fastest
belly-whopper in the world.

64
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,700
And old professor Hinkle
was soon far outdistanced.

65
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
And now it was Frosty's
good fortune that right

66
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,000
at the bottom of the
hill was a tiny greenhouse

67
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,100
used to grow precious tropical
poinsettias for Christmas.

68
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
It's got to be all warm and snug inside

69
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,500
for those Christmas flowers
to grow so beautiful.

70
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,700
Let's go in.

71
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,900
Oh, but, but you will melt!

72
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,600
Just a little. I'll only stay
inside for a minute.

73
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Besides, I've been meaning to
take off a little weight anyway.

74
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Whew, stay in here much longer and
I'll really make a splash in the world.

75
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Now I've got you, and the minute you're

76
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,800
all melted the hat will
be mine! [Evil laughter]

77
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,300
Santa had arrived but was he too late?

78
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,200
Hocus explained the situation to Santa,
who (as you know) speaks a fluent rabbit.

79
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,600
And when they didn't find
Frosty and Karen on the hill...

80
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Santa followed Frosty's path in
the snow to the greenhouse.

81
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,200
But when they got inside,
a terrible sight met their eyes.

82
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,400
[Karen weeping]
[Sad music plays]

83
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,800
# (Very slowly) Frosty
the snowman was a happy,

84
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:57,100
jolly soul with a corn-cob pipe and a
button nose and two eyes made out of coal.

85
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,500
They were too late.

86
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Too late? Why, nonsense!

87
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,500
Don't cry, Karen.
Frosty's not gone for good.

88
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,600
You see, he was made out of Christmas snow

89
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,500
and Christmas snow can
never disappear completely.

90
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,800
Oh, it sometimes goes away
for almost a year at a time

91
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,800
and takes the form of
Spring and Summer rain,

92
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,100
but you can bet your boots that

93
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,400
when a good jolly
December wind kisses it,

94
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,300
it will turn in to Christmas
snow all over again!

95
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,300
Yes, but he was my friend.

96
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,700
[Chuckle] Just watch.

97
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Wait a minute!
I want that hat and I want it now!

98
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Don't you dare touch that!

99
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And just what are YOU going to do about it?

100
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,100
If you so much as lay a finger on the brim,

101
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll never bring you another
Christmas present as long as you live.

102
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,300
Never?

103
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Never!

104
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,800
No more trick cards or magic balls or...

105
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,900
No more anything.

106
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,100
Oh, that's not fair.

107
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,400
I mean, we evil magicians
have to make a living too.

108
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,200
Now you go home and
write "I am very sorry

109
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,000
for what I did to Frosty"
a hundred zillion times.

110
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,500
And then maybe, just maybe, mind you...

111
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,100
you'll find something in your
stocking tomorrow morning.

112
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
A new hat maybe?

113
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,800
Oh, yes sir. Goodbye everyone.

114
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,100
Sorry to lose and run,
but I've got to get busy writing.

115
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,400
Busy busy busy!

116
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,500
Come on, Frosty, we're all waiting for you.

117
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,500
Happy Birthday!

118
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
#Frosty the snowman is
a fairy-tale they say.

119
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day.

120
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,300
And so Santa took Karen home and made

121
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,800
ready to bring Frosty
back to the north pole.

122
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Karen hated to say goodbye to Frosty,

123
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,800
but as Santa promised, Frosty returned every
year with the magical Christmas snow.

124
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,400
And every year there was a great
celebration with a great Christmas parade.

125
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,100
#Thumpity thump thump thumpity
thump. Look at that Frosty go.

126
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,300
Thumpity thump thump thumpity
thump. Over the hills of snow.

127
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,500
#Frosty the snowman,
was a jolly, happy soul.

128
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,800
With a corn-cob pipe and a button
nose, and two eyes made out of coal.

129
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,700
And with Frosty the snowman,
Christmas was always very merry indeed.

130
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,100
You have a merry Christmas too!

131
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,000
#Frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way,

132
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,400
but he waved goodbye
saying don't you cry.

133
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,300
I'll be back on Christmas day!
