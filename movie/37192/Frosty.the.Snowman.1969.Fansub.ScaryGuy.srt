1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,120
I suppose it all started with the snow.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,720
You see, it's a very special kind of snow.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,030
A snow to make the happy happier and the giddy even giddier.

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,500
A snow to make a homecoming homier

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,750
and natural enemies friends, naturally.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,110
For it was the first snow of the season.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,500
And as any child can tell you, there's a certain magic to the very first snow...

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,960
especially when it falls on the day before Christmas.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,000
For when the first snow is also a Christmas snow... [Laughing]

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,020
Well, something wonderful is bound to happen!

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
[Children laughing]

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,990
[Ruler tapping] Children, back to your seats.  The snow can wait.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, now.  I've hired professor Hinkle, the magician,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,270
to entertain at today's class Christmas party, so pay attention!

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,360
Now, Professor Hinkle was just about the worst magician in the world.

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,670
[BONK, PING, TINKLE, SCRABBLE, DOINK]

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,280
And so, I put the magic eggs in to my hat.

18
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,840
Abracadabra, to coin a phrase... [Laugh]

19
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,300
And voila the eggs have turned in to...

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,620
Messy messy messy.

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,530
[Children groan]

22
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,270
Where IS that rabbit?

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,280
Hocus Pocus! Where ARE you?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Bah, the only thing this hat's good for is the trash can!

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,160
[Children laugh]

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,840
[Bell rings][Children cheer]

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,340
[Hinkle grumbles]

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Hey, look at the snow!  It's cold and snowy! It's the best kind of snow!  [etc.]

29
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,960
We're building a snowman, Karen. You make the head!

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,880
The head is the most difficult part, ask anyone!

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,380
What will we call him?  Should we call him Harold?  Nah.

32
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,740
[Mumbling]? Oh, No.

33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,380
Oatmeal? Oatmeal?!

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,960
How about... Frosty?

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,980
Frosty?

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah! Frosty it is.  Frosty the snowman!

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,900
[Cheers]

38
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:25,600
[Frosty the snowman, what a happy, jolly soul. With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.]

39
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,980
Frosty the snow -

40
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,680
- Come back here, YOU!

41
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,020
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,840
That hat brought Frosty to life.  It must be magic.

43
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,940
Magic?  My hat, magic?

44
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,020
Just look.

45
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,820
If that hat is magic, I want it back.

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,520
But it's not yours anymore! You threw it away!

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Don't talk back to your elders, you naughty naughty little girl.

48
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,020
And you, stay in there, or there will be no carrots for Christmas.

49
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,480
But you can't take that hat back, it brought Frosty to life

50
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,320
You saw it happen! I saw nothing of the kind.

51
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,900
I saw nothing of the kind.

52
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,340
[Chattering]

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,680
Quiet, I can't lose that hat if it's really got magic now!

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,840
It'll make me a billionaire magician!

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,120
But we saw Frosty come to life, didn't we? Uh-huh, we sure did.

56
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,980
You silly children believe everything you see.

57
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,540
When you're grown up you'll realize that snowmen can't come to life.

58
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,080
But we -

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,820
Silly, silly silly!

60
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,200
Aw, Frosty, we don't care what grown-ups say, we know you DID come to life.

61
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,000
We know, Frosty.  We just know.

62
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:16,620
[Frosty the snowman, was a jolly, happy soul. With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.]

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:26,780
[Frosty the snowman is a fairy-tale they say. He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.]

64
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,460
Now, of course, the hat DID belong to Frosty and the children.

65
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,880
That part must be made very clear.

66
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,440
Therefore, Hocus Pocus was entirely in the right in what he was about to do.

67
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,080
Well, Hocus Pocus raced back to the children just as fast as he could.

68
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,760
[Hocus Pocus whistles]

69
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,220
Look!  The hat's back.  Let's see if it will make Frosty alive again.

70
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,280
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,920
Hey, I said my first words... but snowmen can't talk.

72
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,700
Alright, come on now, what's the joke. Could I really be alive?

73
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:55,280
I mean, I can make words, I can move. I can juggle, I can sweep, I can count to 10.

74
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:06,920
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 8... Well, I can count to 5. [laughing]

75
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,320
What do you know?  I'm even ticklish.  In fact, I'm all living.  I AM alive!

76
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,700
What a neat thing to happen to a nice guy like me.  [Children cheer]

77
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,300
[There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found.]

78
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,500
[For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.]

79
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:40,940
[Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be and the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me.]

80
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,220
Uh oh...

81
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,420
What's the matter, Frosty?

82
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,300
Whew, is there a thermometer around here?

83
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,160
Over there on the wall, why?

84
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Oh, I was afraid of that.  The thermomter is getting red.  I hate red thermometers.

85
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
Why, Frosty?

86
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,200
'Cause when the thermometer gets all reddish, the temperature goes up.

87
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,520
And when the temperature goes up, I start to melt.  And when I start to melt...

88
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,980
I get all wishy washy!

89
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,300
Then you've gotta go some place where you'll NEVER melt.

90
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,680
The only place I'd never melt is the north pole.

91
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,920
Then we've got to get you there!

92
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, we'll take you downtown to the railroad station and put you on a train.

93
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,040
Great, I always wanted to see the town. Let's make a party out of it!

94
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,160
Let's have a parade!

95
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:59,380
[Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day, so he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away.]

[Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand, running here and there all around the square, saying catch me if you can.]

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,620
Come on kids, follow the leader!

98
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:54,240
[He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop, and he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop.]

[Cop blows whistle] Stop.  STOP.  STOP!

We'd like a ticket to the north pole please.

Hmm... What?  Yes.  The north pole?  Oh, yes ma'am.

A refrigerated boxcar on a train headed north. You'll be safe there, Frosty!  Come on!

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,500
Now that's a silly question.  You wouldn't be sneezing if you weren't cold.

152
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:06,740
Well... just... just a lit... little. [Sneeze]

153
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,840
Frosty realized that Karen had to get out of that car as soon as possible.

154
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,480
So when the little freight train stopped to let an express full of happy Christmas travelers pass,

155
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Frosty took advantage of the opportunity and quickly got them all off.

156
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,960
Oh, you tricked me!  NO FAIR!

157
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,680
The only thing professor Hinkle could do was make a jump for it.

158
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:51,160
[BONK, PING, TINKLE, SHATTER, DOINK]

159
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,900
[Howling wind]

160
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,640
Frosty wanted to get as far away as he could before Hinkle woke up.

161
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,440
[Hocus' teeth chatter]

162
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,020
[Sneeze]

163
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,640
But the woods through which they traveled were still bitterly cold.

164
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,240
Hocus, I've got to get Karen all warmed up or she's a gonner!

165
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,920
I can't make a fire.  Oh boy, that's one thing I really can't do.

166
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,160
I guess we just better keep moving until we find somebody who can.

167
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,920
Then suddenly they came upon a tiny glen which seemed almost magical.

168
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:53,980
For it was Christmas eve and the woodland animals were all decorating for their big celebration.

169
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,800
They knew Santa was to come that night and they wanted everything to be just right.

170
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,620
Hocus, speak to the animals.  See if they won't all pitch in and build a fire for Karen.

171
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:18,960
[Squeaky noises]

172
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,100
The animals were delighted to help.

173
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,260
so they found a spot away from the glen where the fire wouldn't catch on to the trees.

174
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:36,460
Soon there was a spark and in almost no time a splendid fire was crackling away.

175
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,520
Frosty was careful to stay far away from the flames.

176
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,580
Hocus, we've got to find someone to help Karen get home before she freezes.

177
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,880
And me to the north pole before I melt, but who?

178
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,450
No, not the Marines.

179
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,260
No, not the president of the United States.

180
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,060
Oh, they were both swell ideas, but we've got to find someone nearby.

181
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,370
Yeah, Santa Claus.  That's a great idea. Why didn't I think of that before?

182
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,490
Hocus, you go back with the animals and when Santa comes, you bring him right here.

183
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,550
Understand?

184
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,000
Hurry now!

185
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,480
So Frosty kept a silent vigil,

186
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,680
waiting patiently all through the night until Santa would arrive.

187
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,810
But suddenly...

188
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,600
Oh, a campfire.

189
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,210
Well isn't that all snug and comfy? [Evil laughter]

190
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,000
[Professor Hinkle blows]

191
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,850
No!  Don't!

192
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,990
Now give me that hat or else!

193
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,160
Or else what?

194
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,000
Well don't bother me with details, give me that hat!

195
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,430
Get on my shoulders, Karen!

196
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:33,840
You see, Frosty, since he was made of snow  himself was the fastest belly-whopper in the world.

197
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,070
And old professor Hinkle was soon far outdistanced.

198
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,340
And now it was Frosty's good fortune that right at the bottom of the hill was a tiny greenhouse

199
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,500
used to grow precious tropical poinsettias for Christmas.

200
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,920
It's got to be all warm and snug inside for those Christmas flowers to grow so beautiful.

201
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,130
Let's go in.

202
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,320
Oh, but, but you will melt!

203
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,020
Just a little.  I'll only stay inside for a minute.

204
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,700
Besides, I've been meaning to take off a little weight anyway.

205
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,550
Whew, stay in here much longer and I'll REALLY make a splash in the world.

206
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:50,520
Now I've got you, and the minute you're all melted the hat will be mine! [Evil laughter]

207
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,880
Santa had arrived but was he too late?

208
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:10,190
Hocus explained the situation to Santa, who (as you know) speaks a fluent rabbit.

209
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,240
And when they didn't find Frosty and Karen on the hill...

210
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,710
Santa followed Frosty's path in the snow to the greenhouse.

211
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,880
But when they got inside, a terrible sight met their eyes.

212
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:44,430
[Karen weeping] [Sad music plays]

213
00:20:44,560 --> 00:21:09,500
[(Very slowly) Frosty the snowman was a happy, jolly soul with a corn-cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal.]

214
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,280
They were too late.

215
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,020
Too late?  Why, nonsense!

216
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,080
Don't cry, Karen. Frosty's not gone for good.

217
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,190
You see, he was made out of Christmas snow

218
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,010
and Christmas snow can never disappear completely.

219
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,370
Oh, it sometimes goes away for almost a year at a time

220
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,470
and takes the form of Spring and Summer rain,

221
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:48,060
but you can bet your boots that when a good jolly December wind kisses it,

222
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,980
it will turn in to Christmas snow all over again!

223
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,990
Yes, but he was my friend.

224
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,390
[Chuckle] Just watch.

225
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,000
WAIT A MINUTE!  I want that hat and I want it now!

226
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,830
Don't you dare touch that!

227
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,620
And just what are YOU going to do about it?

228
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,880
If you so much as lay a finger on the brim,

229
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,150
I'll never bring you another Christmas present as long as you live.

230
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,090
Never?

231
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,870
Never!

232
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,500
No more trick cards or magic balls or...

233
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,630
No more anything.

234
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,890
Oh, that's not fair.

235
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,110
I mean, we evil magicians have to make a living too.

236
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:59,740
Now you go home and write "I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty" a hundred zillion times.

237
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,240
And then maybe, just maybe, mind you...

238
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,830
you'll find something in your stocking tomorrow morning.

239
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,200
A new hat maybe?

240
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,680
 Oh, yes sir.  Goodbye everyone.

241
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,950
Sorry to lose and run, but I've got to get busy writing.

242
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,260
Busy busy busy!

243
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,390
Come on, Frosty, we're all waiting for you.

244
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,360
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

245
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:45,000
[Frosty the snowman is a fairy-tale they say. He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day.]

246
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,640
And so Santa took Karen home and made ready to bring Frosty back to the north pole.

247
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,570
Karen hated to say goodbye to Frosty,

248
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,760
but as Santa promised, Frosty returned every year with the magical Christmas snow.

249
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,390
  And every year there was a great celebration with a great Christmas parade.

250
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:26,200
[Thumpity thump thump thumpity thump. Look at that Frosty go. Thumpity thump thump thumpity thump. Over the hills of snow.]

251
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:37,760
[Frosty the snowman, was a jolly, happy soul. With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.]

252
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,670
And with Frosty the snowman, Christmas was always very merry indeed.

253
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,160
You have a merry Christmas too!

254
00:24:49,530 --> 00:25:00,490
[Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way, but he waved goodbye saying don't you cry...]

255
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,360
I'll be back on Christmas day!

256
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Merry Christmas - To: Robyn. From: Dan.

257
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:26,100
And Merry Christmas to the pirates of the intarnets!
