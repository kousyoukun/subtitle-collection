1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,621
I suppose it all started with the snow.

2
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:15,043
You see, it's a very special kind of snow.

3
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,524
A snow to make the happy happier

4
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:20,074
and the giddy even giddier.

5
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:23,345
A snow to make a homecoming homier

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,183
and natural enemies friends, naturally.

7
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:30,145
For it was the first snow of the season.

8
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:32,871
And as any child can tell you,

9
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:36,594
there's a certain magic
to the very first snow...

10
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:39,960
especially when it falls on
the day before Christmas.

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,110
For when the first snow is
also a Christmas snow...

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,020
Well, something wonderful
is bound to happen!

13
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:00,724
Children, back to your seats.
The snow can wait.

14
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,038
Now, now.

15
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:06,644
I've hired professor
Hinkle, the magician,

16
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:10,190
to entertain at today's
class Christmas party,

17
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:12,653
so pay attention!

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,679
Now, Professor Hinkle was just about
the worst magician in the world.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,280
And so, I put the magic
eggs in to my hat.

20
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:32,840
Abracadabra, to coin a phrase...

21
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,300
And voila the eggs
have turned into...

22
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:44,206
Messy, messy, messy.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,270
Where is that rabbit?

24
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:55,479
Hocus Pocus! Where are you?

25
00:01:55,903 --> 00:02:00,637
Bah, the only thing this hat's
good for is the trash can!

26
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:28,593
You would desert Hinkle for
some stupid frozen water?

27
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,753
Hey, look at the snow!

28
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:33,508
It's cold and snowy!

29
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,989
Yeah, it's the best kind of snow!

30
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,371
I like snow.

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,986
Yeah, that's good.

32
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,559
We're building a snowman, Karen.

33
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,183
You make the head.

34
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,850
The head is the most difficult part.

35
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:49,986
Ask anyone.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,985
- What will we call him?
- Should we call him Harold?

37
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,355
Nah!

38
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,715
- Christopher Columbus?
- Oh, No.

39
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,293
- Oatmeal?
- Oatmeal?!

40
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,762
How about... Frosty?

41
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:08,980
Frosty?

42
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:12,853
Yeah! Frosty it is.

Happy Birthday!

50
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,184
That hat brought Frosty to life.

51
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:50,591
It must be magic.

52
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,940
Magic? My hat, magic?

53
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,879
Just look.

54
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:02,225
If that hat is magic,
I want it back.

55
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,074
But it's not yours anymore!

56
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,489
You threw it away!

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't talk back to your elders,
you naughty naughty little girl.

58
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,681
And you, stay in there,

59
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,896
or there will be no
carrots for Christmas.

60
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,361
But you can't take
that hat back.

61
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,151
It brought Frosty to life.

62
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,857
You saw it happen!

63
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:24,782
I saw nothing of the kind.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,292
Quiet.

65
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:30,524
I can't lose that hat if
it's really got magic now.

66
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,840
It'll make me a
billionaire magician!

67
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,247
But we saw Frosty come
to life, didn't we?

68
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:40,144
Uh-huh, we sure did.

69
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,980
You silly children believe
everything you see.

70
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,588
When you're grown up you'll realize
that snowmen can't come to life.

71
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:50,931
But we -

72
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:54,208
Silly, silly, silly!

73
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:00,987
Aw, Frosty, we don't
care what grown-ups say.

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,438
We know you did come to life.

75
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:07,437
We know, Frosty. We just know.

76
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:09,879
♪ Frosty the snowman ♪

77
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:12,669

84
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:40,326
Now, of course, the hat did belong
to Frosty and the children.

85
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,731
That part must be
made very clear.

86
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:47,470
Therefore, Hocus Pocus was
entirely in the right

87
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:50,314
in what he was about to do.

88
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:04,063
Well, Hocus Pocus raced back to the
children just as fast as he could.

89
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,994
Look! The hat's back.

90
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,111
Let's see if it will
make Frosty alive again.

91
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,562
Happy Birthday!

92
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,217
Hey, I said my first words...

93
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:37,912
but snowmen can't talk.

94
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,455
Alright, come on now,
what's the joke.

95
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:45,575
Could I really be alive?

96
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,666
I mean, I can make words.

97
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,390
I can move.

98
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:51,363
I can juggle.

99
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:53,196
I can sweep.

100
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:55,434
I can count to 10.

101
00:06:55,624 --> 00:07:02,490
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 6, 8...

102
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,443
Well, I can count to 5.

103
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,355
What do you know?
I'm even ticklish.

104
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,253
In fact, I'm all living.

105
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,331
I am alive!

106
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:18,816

What's the matter, Frosty?

117
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:52,230
Whew, is there a thermometer around here?

118
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:55,178
Over there on the wall, why?

119
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:00,735
Oh, I was afraid of that.

120
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:02,696
The thermometer is getting red.

121
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,810
I hate red thermometers.

122
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,435
Why, Frosty?

123
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,431
'Cause when the thermometer
gets all reddish,

124
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,108
the temperature goes up.

125
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,475
And when the temperature
goes up, I start to melt.

126
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,531
And when I start to melt...

127
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,001
I get all wishy washy!

128
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:21,479
Then you've gotta go some place
where you'll never melt.

129
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:24,725
The only place I'd never
melt is the North Pole.

130
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,710
Then we've got to get you there!

131
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:30,753
Yeah, we'll take you downtown
to the railroad station

132
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,008
and put you on a train.

133
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:36,080
Great, I always wanted
to see the town.

134

Alright, didn't you see that traffic light?

00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,652
What's a traffic light?

155
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:06,472
Up there on the lamp post!

156

158
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:12,708
I'd love one.

160
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:15,778
Huh?

161
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,135
You've got to excuse him, sir.

162
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,540
You see, he just came to life

163
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,349
and he doesn't know
much about such things.

164

Oh, well, okay, if he just came to life.

165
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:28,982
Move along!

166
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:30,759
The silly snowmen.

167
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:33,351
Once they come to life
they don't know nothing.

168
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:35,960
Come to life?!

169
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,034
We'd like a ticket to
the North Pole please.

170
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:07,925
Hmm... What? North Pole?
Oh, yes ma'am.

171
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,623
Route you by the way
of Saskatchewan,

172
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,198
Hudson Bay, Nome Alaska,

173
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,433
the Klondike, and
Aurora Borealis!

174
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:31,244
Gotta make a change at
Nanuk of the Northville.

175
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,123
That'll be $3,000 and four
cents, including tax.

176
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:40,214
Oh, but we don't have any money...

177
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,511
No money!?

178
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:49,233
No money, no ticket!

179
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,569
Now I'll never get
to the north pole.

180
00:11:56,636 --> 00:12:00,802
Oh, Frosty, you just can't melt!

181
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:04,315
Oh, Karen, don't you
get all slushy too.

182
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:09,687
What is it, Hocus?

183
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:11,522
Out the window?

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,270
A refrigerated boxcar on
a train headed north.

185
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,926
You'll be safe there, Frosty!

186
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,466
Come on!

187
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,905
It's full of ice cream and
frozen Christmas cakes.

188
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,282
What a neat way to travel!

189
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:45,556
Hurry up, Frosty. The train is pulling out!

190
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,246
Are you coming to the North Pole, too?

191
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,821
I'm sure my mother won't mind,

192
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,344
as long as I'm home
in time for supper.

193
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,580
♪ Frosty the snowman ♪

194
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,357
♪ had to hurry on his way ♪

195
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:14,335
♪ but he waved goodbye ♪
♪ saying don't cry ♪

196

197
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,433
I must get that hat back.

198
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:25,482
Think, nasty, think, nasty, think nasty..

199
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:31,607
♪ He'll be back again some day ♪

200
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:40,804
Now actually, a refrigerated boxcar
is a splendid way to travel.

201
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:46,837
Splendid that is... if one is a
snowman or a furry coated rabbit.

202
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,599
But for Karen...

203
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,509
Are you cold, Karen?

204
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,778
Now that's a silly question.

205
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,602
You wouldn't be sneezing
if you weren't cold.

206
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,826
Well... just... just a lit... little.

207
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:11,012
Frosty realized that Karen had to get
out of that car as soon as possible.

208
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:15,107
So when the little
freight train stopped

209
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:18,849
to let an express full of happy
Christmas travelers pass,

210
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,421
Frosty took advantage
of the opportunity

211
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,919
and quickly got them all off.

212
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:32,444
Oh, you tricked me! No fair!

213
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:38,971
The only thing professor Hinkle
could do was make a jump for it.

214
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:02,656
Frosty wanted to get as far away
as he could before Hinkle woke up.

215
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:18,697
But the woods through which they
traveled were still bitterly cold.

216
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:25,416
Hocus, I've got to get Karen all
warmed up or she's a goner.

217
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,309
I can't make a fire.

218
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:34,137
Oh boy, that's one thing
I really can't do.

219
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:38,220
I guess we just better keep moving
until we find somebody who can.

220
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:45,237
Then suddenly they came upon a tiny
glen which seemed almost magical.

221
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:49,933
For it was Christmas eve
and the woodland animals

222
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,231
were all decorating for
their big celebration.

223
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:56,370
They knew Santa was
to come that night

224
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:59,711
and they wanted everything
to be just right.

225
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:02,203
Hocus, speak to the animals.

226
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,772
See if they won't all pitch in
and build a fire for Karen.

227
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,475
The animals were delighted to help.

228
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,756
So they found a spot
away from the glen

229
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:27,204
where the fire wouldn't
catch on to the trees.

230
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:32,347
Soon there was a spark
and in almost no time

231
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:35,553
a splendid fire was
crackling away.

232
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,797
Frosty was careful to stay
far away from the flames.

233
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:56,832
Hocus, we've got to find someone to
help Karen get home before she freezes.

234
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:01,278
And me to the North Pole
before I melt, but who?

235
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,459
No, not the Marines.

236
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:12,492
No, not the president of the United States.

237
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:15,039
Oh, they were both swell ideas,

238
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:17,312
but we've got to
find someone nearby.

239
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:26,189
Yeah, Santa Claus.
That's a great idea.

240
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:28,648
Why didn't I think
of that before?

241
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:36,166
Hocus, you go back with the
animals and when Santa comes,

242
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,561
you bring him right here.

243
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:38,733
Understand?

244
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,006
Hurry now!

245
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,716
So Frosty kept a silent vigil,

246
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:57,836
waiting patiently all through the
night until Santa would arrive.

247
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,714
But suddenly...

248
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,490
Oh, a campfire.

249
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,782
Well isn't that all snug and comfy?

250
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:10,921
No! Don't!

251
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:14,266
Now, give me that hat or else!

252
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:16,127
Or else what?

253
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:19,020
Well don't bother
me with details.

254
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:21,409
Give me that hat!

255
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:23,815
Get on my shoulders, Karen!

256
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:28,531
You see, Frosty, since he
was made of snow himself

257
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:32,956
was the fastest
belly-whopper in the world.

258
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:44,156
And old professor Hinkle
was soon far outdistanced.

259
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:52,416
And now it was
Frosty's good fortune

260
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,536
that right at the
bottom of the hill

261
00:18:54,561 --> 00:19:02,629
was a tiny greenhouse used to grow precious
tropical poinsettias for Christmas.

262
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:05,969
It's got to be all
warm and snug inside

263
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:08,970
for those Christmas flowers
to grow so beautiful.

264
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,251
Let's go in.

265
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,487
Oh, but, but you will melt!

266
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:15,919
Just a little.

267
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:18,070
I'll only stay
inside for a minute.

268
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,931
Besides, I've been meaning to
take off a little weight anyway.

269
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:30,660
Whew, stay in here much longer and I'll
really make a splash in the world.

270
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,085
Now I've got you,

271
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,271
and the minute you're all
melted the hat will be mine!

272
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:55,913
Santa had arrived but
was he too late?

273
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:05,254
Hocus explained the
situation to Santa,

274
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:09,163
who speaks a fluent rabbit.

275
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:14,158
And when they didn't find
Frosty and Karen on the hill,

276
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:18,813
Santa followed Frosty's path
in the snow to the greenhouse.

277
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:24,785
But when they got inside, a
terrible sight met their eyes.

278
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:47,641
♪ Frosty the snowman ♪

279
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:51,887
♪ Was a happy, jolly soul ♪

282
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,786
They were too late.

283
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:18,016
Too late? Why, nonsense!

284
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,438
Don't cry, Karen.

285
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,861
Frosty's not gone for good.

286
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:27,331
You see, he was made
out of Christmas snow

287
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:31,021
and Christmas snow can never
disappear completely.

288
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,384
Oh, it sometimes goes away
for almost a year at a time

289
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:40,207
and takes the form of
spring and summer rain,

290
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,467
but you can bet your boots that when a
good jolly December wind kisses it,

291
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:51,111
it will turn in to Christmas
snow all over again!

292
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,994
Yes, but he was my friend.

293
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,877
Just watch.

294
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,691
Wait a minute!

295
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:15,354
I want that hat and
I want it now!

296
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:18,159
Don't you dare touch that!

297
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,858
And just what are you
going to do about it?

298
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:25,113
If you so much as lay
a finger on the brim,

299
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:30,572
I'll never bring you another Christmas
present as long as you live.

300
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:32,979
Never?

301
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,346
Never!

302
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:40,272
No more trick cards
or magic balls or...

303
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,639
No more anything.

304
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:46,110
Oh, that's not fair.

305
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:51,174
I mean, we evil magicians
have to make a living too.

306
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:58,806
Now you go home and write "I am very sorry for
what I did to Frosty" a hundred zillion times.

307
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:02,348
And then maybe, just maybe, mind you...

308
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:05,907
you'll find something in your
stocking tomorrow morning.

309
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:09,034
A new hat maybe?

310
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:12,682
Oh, yes sir. Goodbye everyone.

311
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:16,977
Sorry to lose and run, but
I've got to get busy writing.

312
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:20,240
Busy, busy, busy!

313
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,863
Come on, Frosty, we're all waiting for you.

314
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:32,579
Happy Birthday!

315
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:34,599
♪ Frosty the snowman ♪

316
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:37,365

00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,119
and made ready to bring Frosty
back to the North Pole.

321
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,199
Karen hated to say goodbye to Frosty,

322
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,110
but as Santa promised,

323
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:05,306
Frosty returned every year with
the magical Christmas snow.

324
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:10,864
And every year there was a great
celebration with a great Christmas parade.
