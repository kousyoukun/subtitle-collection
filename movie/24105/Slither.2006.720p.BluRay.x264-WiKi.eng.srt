1
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,808
Whiperwill flies about.... 27 miles an hour.

2
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,941
That what you thought it woulda been?   -Sure.

3
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:32,245
I'd a thought more like... 31 or something.
-Hm

4
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,467
God damn that's a pisser

5
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,970
Normally I could look at anything.

6
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:54,225
Tell you exactly how fast
it's goin' within 2 miles per hour... -It's fascinating.

7
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,314
I'm gonna...

8
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:09,842
Get the fuck outta
the way cocksucker!

9
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:15,681
Mornin' mayor

10
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:19,685
Hi, how're ya'll doing?

11
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,067
Easy come, easy go

12
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,909
When Darwin said fittest...

13
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,204
He didn't necessarily mean the strongest

14
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:42,207
Or the most intelligence or any one trait

15
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:46,545
He merely meant those oraganism most
well suited to their environments

16
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,047
Now, we humans

17
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:51,758
We think we're more fit

18
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,677
More evolved because

19
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:55,929
We're smarter, We're neophytes

20
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,850
We've only been on this earth 2 million years, give or take

21
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:04,563
The cockroach, that fella's been around
350 million years

22
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:09,443
So based on that which of us is
the more successful species

23
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,656
Lots of folks build houses on unsafe ground

24
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:19,286
The erosion of Cambodia is some of the worst,
my friends wanted to buy a house there but...

25
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:20,537
Hey, c'mon

26
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:21,538
Hey Grant

27
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:23,457
Later Hank

28
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,378
He's teaching evironmental studies,
he's gonna borrow one of my lesson plans

29
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:30,422
Oh, I know what he want's to borrow

30
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:31,882
And I ain't lendin'

31
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:34,384
Come on you little varmits

32
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:35,886
That's it

33
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,182
See you guys later
- That's it

34
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,108
That's one match I'll never get

35
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:55,321
Ain't no mystery...
Starla's raisin' them shanties off St. Luke dirt poor

36
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,282
All she ever wanted was to be a lady

37
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:00,326
Ol' Grant Grant, he's always been made of green

38
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:02,495
Gold digger, huh?
- Oh hell Margeret

39
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,915
Starla's mother left her, her daddy's a drunk,
she's 17 years old

40
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:09,002
Old Grant pulls up, big old cadillac, house on a hill

41
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,920
And college tuition, what would you do?

42
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:14,757
- Hell, if he'd had a gina you'd a married him too
- What's a "gina"?

43
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:17,802
It's a country

44
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,221
You know where "Ginese" people come from

45
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:23,933
Learn to easedrop better
Zack, Hell! Your mother's waitin' over there

46
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:25,059
What the hell you doing here?

47
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,060
Scoot, Scoot!

48
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,564
Sugerplum! You comin' to bed?

49
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,793
Oh yeah

50
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,595
You know what baby?

51
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:04,974
I'm just not really in the mood

52
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:08,853
Come on babydoll, it's been long time we both need it

53
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:10,646

00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:28,205
That's disrespectful

57
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:30,207
Come on now, l just playing with you!

58
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,085
Come on baby!

59
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:37,423
Why don't you just work one out for yourself there

60
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:41,802
Oh honey l'm just not in
the mood, can't you tell?

61
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,931
When the hell are you in the mood?

62
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:58,610
Where you going?

63
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,158
Out... for a walk!

64
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,745
Grant, baby

65
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,568
Uh, yeah, hit me again there killer

66
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,050
Meagen Montgomery's little sister

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,970
You kidding me

68
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,596
Brenda

69
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,977
My sister Meagen, she was a big fat old cow

Shit, come on now

72
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:22,443
You couldn't have been more than 10 or 11

73
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:30,868

Just like a piece of shit!

81
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,024
At least I don't got the same last name as first

82
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,901

Starla

86
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:29,760
She gets a little worried about me

I dunno

93
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,127
There's a trail.

94
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:23,897
Ah, oh that's gross

95

Oh God!

101
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:32,590

00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:02,948
and make you feel rejected

111
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,539
I do want to be a good wife

112
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,467
You're crying

113
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,620
Baby, what's this?

114
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,501
Just a little bug bite

115
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:21,192
What are you so smiley about?

116

00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,573
Grant and I had a good morning
and it's been a while.

118
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,785
You slut!

119
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,831
You're a married woman

It just Grant, I dunno, it's like.

121
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:45,549
It was like he was discovering all these
different parts of my body, you know like...

122
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,843
like little boy or something.

123
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,096
l'm telling you this morning I sensed a real change in Grant

124
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,648
Meat meat meat

125
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:02,858
Howdy, Mr. Grant

126
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,652
Oh hey there killer

128
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:10,240
Eight

129
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,159
No, ten

130
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,538
No, no, you know what?

131

How... Give me 14.

132
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,459

Yeah some like that.

134
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:26,465
It's a ittle surprised for the wife.

135
00:16:41,313 --> 00:16:42,064
Grant!

136
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,191
What's this lock doing on the door?

137
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,944
Baby, you drilled right into the frame,
it's all busted up

138
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,330
Sugerplum, you really think you sould be asking so
many questions when it's so close to your birthday

139
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,749
My birthday is not for 2 months

140
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:01,750
That's close

141
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,959
not really

142
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:04,336
matter of opinion

143
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:46,377
Grant, I'm jumping in the shower.
Baby we need to leave in 40 minutes

144
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:46,878
Oh

145
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,257
What're you doing?

146
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:19,845
Nothing, l got. l got to go to

147
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:21,180
What?

148
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,391
Grant, Deer Cheer starts in about an hour
and you promised me

149
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,851
Gotta go, gotta go to work!

l will never understand what joy a

152
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,961
Grown man gets using a thousand dollar weapon
to blow the face off a cute little deer

153
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:03,680
surprised you're able to lift a mug

154
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,474
That remind me of something I wanted to tell you

What's that?
-Fuck you fatass!

156
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:31,624
Grant!

157
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,751
Damn girl!

158
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:37,172
You are chocolate for the eyes!

159
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:40,383
I thought maybe you was dead

161
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:44,012
Don't I look it?

162
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:52,270
The old half Mexican around?

163
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:54,981
'sides this 'un

164
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,151

00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:28,389

I don't know he was supposed to meet me here but...

175
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:58,502
It's kinda chilly tonight
-Yeah, Sure is purdy

176
00:22:10,472 --> 00:22:13,058
It's probably time for the countdown, almost

00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:24,695

181
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:38,417
Thank you!

182
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,339
Cheese and crackers
- Ladies and gentleman

183
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:49,302
Right after God invented this world of ours

184
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,847
He came unto Adam

185
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:55,183
and He said that man sould have dominion

186
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,978
over the fish in the sea

187
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,480
and over the birds in the air

188
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:07,737
And over every living thing that
moveth upon the Earth

189
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,032
Now, I believe...

190
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:13,660
when God say that!

191
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,917
He was thinking of deer season and Wheelsy
how much damn fun it is to shoot a buck or two

192
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:33,847
Are you ready?
- Yeah!!!

197
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:40,770

Oh God, Grant!

204
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:56,703

Grant you know about this fuse?

206
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,025

207
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,246

211
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,472
I had a little reaction, that's all

212
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:27,102
We gotta get you to the hospital
- No, no no

213

I already saw doctor Carl...

214
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:34,859
"it should clear up soon"

215
00:26:36,152 --> 00:26:38,905
He said "things like this happen...

216
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,741
happens to people all the time"

217
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,080
Come one baby, don't...

218
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,707

219
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,420

00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:55,755

225
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,645

232
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:19,463

Hey Starla

237
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,207
Bill, Wally
- Hi!

238
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,002

- Oh no, he's not home from work yet

239
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,880
Mr. Grant!
- He's not home yet Wally, I just said

240
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:05,425
What's going on?

241
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:08,470
Do you know Brenda Gutierrez

242
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:11,807
Maybe she called the house...
- No

243
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,854
Girl disappeared Friday night

244
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:20,190
Signs of struggle in the house

245
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:21,942
Here in town

246
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:23,235
Yeah the thing is...

247
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:25,695
people saw Grant goin into her house

248
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:27,739
And that's the last thing they seen of her

249
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:31,034
It must have been someone that looks like Grant

250
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:34,496
Yeah, maybe

251
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,751

252
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,922

257
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:51,089
Grant is sick or something...

258
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:12,861
Why you running from me baby?

259
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,571

260
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,949
I love you baby
I tried not to change

261
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:22,078
I get it,
I'm too ugly for you now, is that it?

262
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:24,164
You don't want to hurt me

263
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:27,709
You betrayed me
I cant trust you no more

264
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:33,048

272
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:54,378

00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:56,047

279
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,225
nobody wants to go huntin in a town with
a pet murderer and kidnapper

280
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,602
We'll find him Jack

281
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:11,979

282
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:13,063
Sea world maybe

283
00:34:13,939 --> 00:34:16,317

What's this?

286
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,865
I thought we could use it like a police sketch, chief

287
00:34:22,865 --> 00:34:25,326
You know, take it door to door

291
00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:39,298
Lime disease! -

292
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:42,176
you touch some deer feces
and then ya

293
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:45,012
eat a sandwich without
washing your hands

294
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,638
you got your lime disease

295
00:34:47,097 --> 00:34:48,223
and makes you look like a squid

296
00:34:51,143 --> 00:34:52,686
Oh well fuck you all

297
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:55,480
Chief, another attack

298
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,481

299
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,234
Grants been stealing animals off farms edge of town

300
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,528
Alright folks lets go

301
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:03,071

302
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:05,866
Oh ho ho, ha ha

303
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,911
I reckon Grant ain't got one of them
puppy calenders on his desk

304
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,373

305
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:15,959

306
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:19,254
Knocked this one's head

307
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:21,131

308
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:22,883

309
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:26,136
How can one man do that?

310
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,513
Slay all them dogs by himself?

311
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:30,182
Well, he's gotta be in the forest

312
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:33,894
all 3 ranches run along side it
-I think we should get up a posse

313
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:35,979
And head in there

314
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:39,858
lt's hundred thousand acres,
be like finding a needle in a fuckstack

315
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:42,652
Gather some folks together

316
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,779
think I know where
dr doolittle's gonna strike next

317
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:49,034
right after grant ran off
a cat went missing from here

318
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:50,577
Ranglin's ranch!

319
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:53,246
Two nights ago a mare was stolen

320
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:56,041
from this property owned by Fitzgibbon
that rancher with the cleft pallet

321
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,460
l know that guy, he looks like a chipmunk

322
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,211
your momma weren't too proud
when you came out neither Wally

323
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:02,630
And then we got the Castovettes right here

324
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,340
that's where last nights shitstorm took place

325
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:06,759
