00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:14,030
LIVE NATION PRESENTS NOW TRIPS

3
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:19,286
All nice people,
give an applause for Trevor Noah.

4
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:32,591
What's up, Los Angeles?

5
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:36,678
Welcome to the show.

6
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:40,432
Thank you for coming out.
Thank you for being here.

7
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,895
This is so funny. Welcome out.

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,147
What an audience!

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,150
This is so cool. I love L.A.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,946
I love everything with L.A.,
even people hate with L.A.

11
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,865
I love the traffic.
It's one of my favorite experiences.

12
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:59,952
Yes, when you do not live here it's top.
Absolutely wonderful.

13
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:04,665
You will get to know it, but not forever.
It's like another person's child.

14
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:09,377
You may say: "This is madness.
You'll get it back. "That feels like that.

15
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:17,428
I love it. I love the atmosphere.
I love driving out here.

16
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,347
And when I'm here
can i listen to the radio

17
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:23,100
You have good radio stations,
because you are always in the car.

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,771
Radio is not a big thing for me living
In New York. I'm cycling or walking.

19
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,398
If I listen to music, I die.

20
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:33,610
But in L.A. I only listen to music.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,947
And nowadays all that is called trap music is heard.

22
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:38,615
It's the big thing, the trap.

23
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,909
It's the new music on the radio.

24
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,662
I do not understand what they say,
but I like it.

25
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,247
Every song is the same.

26
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:48,834
Every trap song sounds like a small child
who complain about life.

27
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:51,253
That's all I hear.

28
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:54,089
As soon as a trap song is played
I think of my little brother.

29
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:57,050
He goes out, hurts
and comes home crying,

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,136
and it sounds like every trap song.

31
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,391
"What has happened, Isaac?"

32
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:22,742
"Calm down you," I say.

33
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:26,747
"You played with your friends.
What has happened?"

34
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:28,123
"Friends, they died.

35
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:30,208
Now I've had enough. "

36
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,970
"Go talk to mom,
I do not know what you're saying.

37
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,763
Talk to your mom. "

38
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,106
The Angels City, I love every second.
I'm enjoying my time here.

39
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,776
I just got home from vacation,
so I'm fine.

40
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,487
You know when you have the holiday vibes left.

41
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:01,948
You still feel relaxed
and relaxed.

42
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:05,661
I went to Bali on vacation.
In Indonesia.

43
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,706
Have you never been there,
Plan a trip there, it's amazing.

44
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,502
I went there with some friends
and learned a lot about myself.

45
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:18,173
The most important thing I learned is
that someone needs to create a TripAdvisor

46
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,091
especially for blacks.

47
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:24,596
In general, I find
that the white wants to do on holiday

48
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:27,015
is what black tries to escape from.

49
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,603
Not in a bad way.
We only want different things in life.

50
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,982
My white friends invite for example
always with me to camp.

51
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,818
With enthusiasm.
"Trevor, do you want to come and camp?"

52
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,319
"Why?" I say.

53
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:43,198
"What do you mean?
It is fantastic. Are you kidding?

54
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:47,452
No water and no electricity.
Just us and the wilderness.

55
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:51,164
You get shot in a hole in the field. "

56
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:53,666
"Yes, that was my life," I say.

57
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,586
"Then I grew up.

58
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,546
Do you know how hard I worked?
in order not to camp again? "

59
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,383
Every day!

60
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,053
Every day.

61
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,933
Every day I wake up thinking
"Thank you, I do not camp."

62
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,563
If my family saw pictures where I camped
Should they be broken?

63
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,819
If my grandmother saw me out in the woods
would she say, "What happened to Trevor?

64
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:25,198
I thought he was successful.

65
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,742
It must be all crack. "

66
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,041
I refuse to camp.

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,588
So I went with my friends to Bali.
The planned trip.

68
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:42,799
Before we left, I asked my friend:
"Mitch, what should we do?

69
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,845
He said, "Do not ask, Trevor.
It will be amazing. "

70
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:50,182
"I want to know what it is
that's going to be amazing, "I said.

71
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,809
"Do not ask," he said.

72
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,603
I should have asked.

73
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,273
Because we had fun.

74
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:02,277
But there were some things that were strange
which I had not done on my own.

75
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:07,783
For example, on the third day
we had something like our travel plan was called

76
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:13,580
"An Authentic Balinese Experience".
That's what they called it.

77
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,832
They woke us up at 05.00

78
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,627
and sat in a small bus,
and we drove for three hours.

79
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:20,420
We arrived, got off the bus,

80
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,506
in the middle of what looked like
a distant city,

81
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:26,259
and a little tour guide, very happy,
far too happy for that time, said:

82
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:29,304
"Welcome, everyone.
Are you ready to have fun? "

83
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,306
"Jippi ..." I said.

84
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:35,143
So he said, "My name is Dang Basaan
and is your guide.

85
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:38,188
Today you will get
an authentic Balinese experience.

86
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,399
So exciting! Follow me!

87
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,776
We followed him to a small door.

88
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,278
"It's probably a temple
or a cave, "I thought.

89
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,824
And he said, "Welcome, my ladies
and gentlemen, to the real Bali. "

90
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,492
And he opened the door,

91
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,160
into someone's house.

92
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,080
This was no museum,
but just a house.

93
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,416
Everyone lives there every day.

94
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,126
He opened the door and said,

95
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,544
"Here is a balines.

96
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,840
He eats here. He is sleeping here. "

97
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:08,718
"Does he know we're here?" I thought.

98
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,432
We did not knock. Nobody opened.
As far as I knew we broke in.

99
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:16,517
Something strange Balinese gang.

100
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:19,187
And just when I should ask,
he turned around:

101
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:22,733
"Here you can see the owner of the house.
He's in the corner. "

102
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,361
We turned around and saw a man,
who has been sitting there all the time.

103
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,987
As stoned.

104
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:32,868
I thought, "Does he take part in this?
I do not know if we should do this. "

105
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,079
And Dang Basaan began to speak Balinese
with him.

106
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,582
"Okay, you can move anything."

107
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,420
So I said, "I do not think we ..."

108
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,090
Before I finish him sentence
everyone said in our group: "Yes!

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,800
Touch everything.

110
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,886
Oh my God. Touch everything.

111
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:53,388
Lord, is he sleeping here?

112
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,515
Is this here he's eating?

113
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,518
Hello, I had never done this.

114
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,187
Oh my God.

115
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:03,607
Excuse me. Thanks so much
because you receive us.

116
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,277
Hello, I appreciate my life
so much more now.

117
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,653
Thanks so much.

118
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:11,823
This is terrible.
Can we take a selfie?

119
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:16,912
Thanks. Are you at Instagram? I use
hashtaggen 'men'. Thanks. Oh my God."

120
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,581
Now I was really bad at all,

121
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:22,834
because this was something I should not do,
according to my culture.

122
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:26,671
Like Africa, I should not be in anyone's house
and sneak into their lives.

123
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,049
So I stood in the corner, ill at ease.

124
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,803
The homeowner was very accommodating,
he was friendly

125
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,348
He said, "Yes, thank you. Have a nice time. Thank you."

126
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:38,517
And then he turned to me.

127
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:42,687
And this was a magic moment,
because he smiled at everyone else

128
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:46,191
and my completely changed mind
when he turned around.

129
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:49,986
He was hospitable: "Yes, thanks, thank you ...."

130
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:55,450
And with their eyes,

131
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:59,496
he had the most thorough
conversation with me that I've ever had.

132
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:04,543
Eye conversation is nothing new. You can
Have it with anyone you have any relationship with.

133
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,962
It can be any of the same breed.
out among people.

134
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:10,965
It may be between husband and wife.
Moms are good at eye conversations.

135
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,009
They can really put one in place.

136
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,679
You are out among people together
and you say something stupid ...

137
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,305
"If anyway she did."

138
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,683
And she: "I do not think you said ..."

139
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,977
Just with your eyes.
"I do not think you said so.

140
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:24,479
Just wait.
Do you want to air our dirty suit publicly?

141
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,025
You'll see how this ends. Enjoy
the moment, because you know it's run. "

142
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,945
And you: "Yes, I should not
have done it. "Just with your eyes.

143
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:36,157
That's what he did to me,
for one minute he smiled at everyone,

144
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,701
and then he turned to me.

145
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,953
And just with his eyes he said:
"What are you doing here?"

146
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:42,998
So with my eyes I said:

147
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,876
"Sorry, I did not know
that this was your house.

148
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,086
They called it an authentic experience. "

149
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,588
"Yes, authentic to white," he said.

150
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,717
"You have your own poor.
Go back there. "

151
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:58,471
"Yes, I should not be here," I said.
"Sorry."

152
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,391
So I went.

153
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,934
I went out.

154
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:05,645
A quarter later everyone was ready
with its poverty line,

155
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,522
so they came to me.

156
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:11,776
Dang Basaan followed the group.
And he was great. You saw that.

157
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,987
He came out and said,
"Did everyone have a nice time?

158
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:18,533
I know you liked it. Now its time
for a surprise. Follow me, everyone. "

159
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,494
And he took us to the back of the house,

160
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:25,540
where they had a place
where they seemed to have some sort of behavior.

161
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,626
There was a stage and seating.

162
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,211
He told us to sit down,
so we sat down.

163
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:33,590
There were people from all over the world there.
Me, my American friends,

164
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,260
some brits, and a father and son
from France, who sat next to me.

165
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:40,305
I sat in the front row,
and Dang Basaan came out again.

166
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:43,099
And suddenly he carried
a huge balinese headdress.

167
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,559
Very beautiful.

168
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,645
He said, "Ladies and gentlemen,

169
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,689
Are you ready for an authentic?
balinese experience?

170
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,443
An apple for Balis Snakes. "

171
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,653
"For what?" I said.

172
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:59,115
"He said snakes," I said.

173
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,825
"Balis snake ..."

174
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,370
And I looked, and there were snakes.

175
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,999
A group of men gathered snakes together
to take out to us.

176
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:11,544
So I said, "No, not me."

177
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:15,632
No, because you understand, as a black person,
Culturally, I try not to die.

178
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,966
So...

179
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,760
I started packing up my stuff.

180
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,847
And the French turned to me:

181
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:25,016
"My friend, where are you going?" The show begins. "

182
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,894
I said, "Yes, but the guy said
that there are snakes,

183
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:29,520
so I move.

184
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:31,147
I sit at the back. "

185
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,733
He said, "Do you move
because of the worm? "

186
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:34,651
"Yes," I said.

187
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,529
He said, "Why do you move
because of the worm? Are you afraid of a snake? "

188
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:40,281
"Yes," I said.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,327
That's exactly what I'm afraid of snakes. "

190
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,664
"Such a big man,
but you're afraid of a worm? "he said.

191
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:52,168
"Yes, with a big brain," I said,
"That's why I'm afraid. It's a worm."

192
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,462
You can not fool me
not to be afraid.

193
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:59,217
My poisonous manhood is not so high
that I say, "Yes, come on, Ormis."

194
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,635
It's a worm.

195
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,098
Instead of releasing it, he said:

196
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:07,767
"I do not understand. A big guy like you.
Jean-Pierre ... "

197
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,519
He turned to his son.

198
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,524
And the boy laughed.

199
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,984
"Snake."

200
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:22,490
And he said, "Oui, oui, worm.
Are you afraid? Snake."

201
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,870
What is this? It's a worm. Snake."

202
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,666
And they continued for 15 seconds nonstop.
Back and forth.

203
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,293
"Snake, snake, snake" all the time.

204
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:37,255
He said, "Worm. Are you afraid? Worm."

205
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:40,800
And I: "Yes, yes, you lost
all your war. "Then I went back.

206
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,053
I did not have time with this.

207
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:48,266
I did not have time with this,
because there were snakes.

208
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,769
So I went back, and brought my things.

209
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,813
I sat up at the top
because I wanted to see the show,

210
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,690
I just did not want to be a part of it.

211
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,486
So I took my things
and sat up at the top.

212
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,696
I sat there. The show began.

213
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:04,866
Dang Basaan was really spotted
and said, "Ladies and gentlemen,

214
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,828
an appendix for your first artist,
the mighty pytonorm. "

215
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:13,249
And a guy came out
with a giant python turned around.

216
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,962
He had an awesome number in the pytonorm
hugged him really hard.

217
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:21,007
So hard you almost heard
his legs are broken.

218
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,176
And then he made a leap.

219
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,014
And the worm dropped.

220
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,892
Then it started hugging him again,
and he let ...

221
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,062
And the worm dropped.

222
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,524
It hugged him again
and he did the same thing ...

223
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:42,112
And the worm dropped.
I thought, "This is cool.

224
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:45,948
They have a coherent relationship.
I like that."

225
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,076
Then he went with the worm.

226
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:53,289
The next guy came out
and he had a green mamba with him.

227
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,582
So Dang Basaan said:

228
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,001
"Ladies and gentlemen,
the green mamban. "

229
00:12:57,051 --> 00:13:00,839
The guy came out and he had a cool trick
where he took the lid off the basket

230
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,883
and the green mamban came out
and began to move.

231
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,387
Someone played music
and then the snake joker danced with the worm.

232
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:11,474
They did the same movements as one
Justin Timberlake video, just the two.

233
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,102
I thought, "It was awesome."
The worm slid into the basket again.

234
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:16,521
And then Dang Basaan came out one last time.

235
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,525
He said, "Now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready for the final?

236
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:24,028
An applause for the King of the Kings! "

237
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:28,867
The last artist came out with a cobra.
He put down the basket,

238
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,202
lifted the lid and the worm came out.

239
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:34,205
And I do not know what it was
with this worm,

240
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:37,375
but one could feel
that the energy changed.

241
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,918
Everyone was snakes ...

242
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:42,088
but this worm looked ugly.

243
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:45,592
It seemed to hate life.
There was something about it.

244
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:48,427
This worm looked like
as if it had home loans.

245
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,726
Because it looked at us,

246
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:59,146
and then fixed his eyes on the candler.

247
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,065
He was cool and calm.

248
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:03,443
He did not even look at the worm
but on us.

249
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,778
He said, "Ladies and gentlemen,

250
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:10,157
It is said that kobran can attack
faster than a man can blink.

251
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,829
But can a man move faster
than the worm can think? "

252
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,915
And I thought ...

253
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,794
"I do not know what it means...

254
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:23,963
but I'm in. "

255
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:27,633
It sounds like a silly thing
Instagram quote, but I'm in. "

256
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,387
And the guy had the most
amazing numbers. What he did was ...

257
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:36,643
He really walked close to the snake,
with his hands behind his back,

258
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:40,188
Then he got it to work
as if he were kissing the snake.

259
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:44,108
And the worm was no longer
than 30 cm from his face.

260
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:48,071
And then he did the pusslätten.

261
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:52,867
Then the worm tried to bite him,
and he moved. Completely unmanageable.

262
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,203
But he leaned forward and said,
"Come on, worm."

263
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,252
"Too bad, the worm."

264
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,547
Try again.

265
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,344
No love for you, my friend.

266
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:13,888
Come on, the worm. "

267
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:15,640
And everyone was spellbound.

268
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,768
No one gave a noise,
no one moved.

269
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,062
And he did it over and over again.
And then,

270
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:26,734
to take it to the next level,
he slammed and plucked his lips,

271
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:28,819
and I suppose by now,

272
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:33,032
that the snake probably thought:
"I think I've cheated it out.

273
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:38,829
The guy will make the noise
and then move.

274
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,457
But if I bite before the sound ...

275
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,376
can I change everyone's life. "

276
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,255
Because that was exactly what the worm did.

277
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,594
The guy shut up and pecked his lips.

278
00:15:53,644 --> 00:15:57,265
Before he makes him smile
the snake attacked him,

279
00:15:57,315 --> 00:16:01,894
and met him on his mouth.
Sprang up his lip, the blood was sprinkling.

280
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:05,565
That should be the end of history,
the craziest part of history. No.

281
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,149
This is the middle.

282
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,070
The worm hit him on his mouth.
The blood sprayed.

283
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,905
The guy jumped away,

284
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:16,575
and pretended he was not
just had been bitten by a worm.

285
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:20,872
Which made us think we were crazy,
because we saw it. The whole crowd fled.

286
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:24,417
And then he jumped back,
and just mess it off.

287
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,085
He did the way people do

288
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:28,713
when they get their hand squeezed in a car door
or something.

289
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:32,883
They squeeze and just ...

290
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:37,096
He did it, but with a worm.

291
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,557
Then the worm attacked him,
the blood was sprinkling

292
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:42,059
and he jumped off and ...

293
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,108
"Do not worry. We're fine.

294
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,363
No danger. Everybody, we're fine.
Relax, we're fine. "

295
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:57,157
But we did not feel good for his face
began to melt on one side.

296
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,620
The face began to melt,
The lips turned blue

297
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,706
and he tried to make the trick again,
but he could not even stand.

298
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:09,003
And he looked at the worm and said,
"Okay, the show is over. Good night, everyone."

299
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:11,046
Then he ran away.

300
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:15,426
And now we all thought:
"What the hell happened right?"

301
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,846
He ran away,
I had questions in my head.

302
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,723
"Will he do it?

303
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,892
Do we get our money back?

304
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,643
How does this work? "

305
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,647
And then we turned around and realized ...

306
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:31,025
He had forgotten his worm.

307
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,571
And do you know what the worst was?

308
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,991
The worm seemed to realize the same thing
at the same time.

309
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,869
For the serpent also saw him go,

310
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,248
and then when we return
we saw the worm: "Devils."

311
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:54,256
So now it was just us ...

312
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:56,342
and the worm.

313
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:01,305
And remember, there was no barrier.

314
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,724
No concrete, no glass, nothing.

315
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:06,602
It was an authentic one
balinese experience.

316
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:12,858
So everyone stared at the snake,
the worm stared at us.

317
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:17,613
And then decided a genius
to be the perfect opportunity now

318
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,698
to take an Instagram image.

319
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:23,369
And I do not know if it was the camera,
the sound or the flash.

320
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,331
All I heard was "click",
and the snake jumped up and wested.

321
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,750
And we only ...

322
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,921
And it became a chaos. Tumult arose.

323
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:35,923
I was at the back,
so I just jumped.

324
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,384
"I was afraid I'm black."

325
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,012
I fled the field.

326
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,933
Panic occurred.

327
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,896
Everyone jumped up,
people trampled down each other.

328
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:53,524
The Frenchman was my favorite.
He jumped up and shouted: "Sacre bleu!

329
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,029
Allez, Jean-Pierre, Allz. "

330
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,240
He pushed out people and shouted:
"Allez, Jean-Pierre!"

331
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,577
And when he turned around
had his son not moved.

332
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:07,079
Little Jean-Pierre stood firmly,
terror.

333
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:10,791
You saw his face
and he shouted: "Daddy, Daddy!"

334
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,544
"Allez, Jean-Pierre, Allz, Mon Ami."

335
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,463
"Daddy, Daddy!"

336
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:18,799
So the dad realized he had to go back
and save his child.

337
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,552
But this one of those moments
when you see the difference

338
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,929
between mothers and fathers.

339
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:28,184
Because a mother would run in
without thinking and saying:

340
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:33,022
"I would die for my child.
Attack me now, worm. "

341
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,440
So are mothers.

342
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,652
Daddy also saves his child,
but in the back they think:

343
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:38,903
"I'll save my child.

344
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:41,280
But I do not want to die. I mean...

345
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,742
I do not want to die
because this dummy did not run ...

346
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,036
when his dad ran.

347
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:51,666
Is there a worm and I'm starting to run,
why do not you run at the same time?

348
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:54,085
Now I have to die for you, dumber,
which is illogical,

349
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,546
because I can make one more of you,
You can not make a difference from me.

350
00:19:57,555 --> 00:20:01,509
I should make a brother to you
so we can make you together, dumber.

351
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,302
I do not know what we are dealing with. "

352
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:06,597
That's probably what the dad thought,
because he did not really give everything.

353
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:09,975
Instead, he tried to sneak in
behind his guy.

354
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:13,145
Then he took his hood
and pulled him in security.

355
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,482
So now little Jean-Pierre chipped
after the breath of the ground.

356
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,487
He eventually pulled him aside.

357
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:24,907
Another snake rushes out,
took the worm, put it in the bag,

358
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,368
and at last the danger was over.
Everyone was in safety.

359
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,496
Everyone was safe but terrified.

360
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:33,374
Some cried, others were shocked.

361
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:37,378
I stood by and watched.
Jean-Pierre and his dad were tear-eyed.

362
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:39,254
"Desolé, mon ami."

363
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:44,427
I do not speak French,

364
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,638
but I know the kid said,
"Shit, you left me!

365
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:50,474
I'll tell mom. "

366
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:58,649
So I stared at them,
and they must have known it.

367
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:02,361
So both ended at the same time.

368
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,406
And they turned around and looked at me,
and I looked at them.

369
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:08,700
And at that moment I realized

370
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,369
that we are all human beings.

371
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:13,331
We experienced the same thing,
we went through the same trauma.

372
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,000
No matter what happened to us before
so we are all people.

373
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,877
I saw in their eyes

374
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,338
what they had just experienced,
what I had experienced.

375
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:24,634
And in that break I bent down,
really close to them, and said:

376
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:28,262
"Snake."

377
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,901
That is how racism begins.

378
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,406
But do you know what? It was worth it.

379
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,449
Yes, it was worth it.

380
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:53,579
I love to travel
and learn about new places.

381
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,456
To read things and meet new people.

382
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,500
I ...

383
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,170
When I think of the history of racism ...

384
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,298
I am fascinated by racism as a concept,

385
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:06,008
as action,

386
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:10,262
as politics ... I am always fascinated.
I read stories in history.

387
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:14,183
And one of the most fascinating places
I read about recently

388
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,768
was a place called rochester
In New York.

389
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,897
This really surprised me.

390
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:25,527
It was a city as practically
was intended to rehabilitate ...

391
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,531
people who had escaped slavery.

392
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:33,077
Blacks who moved from the south
and got north,

393
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:34,745
rehabilitated here.

394
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:37,248
Frederick Douglass wrote many
of their works there,

395
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:41,168
suffragett movement began there.
It's a mighty little place.

396
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:43,879
What they did was ...

397
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:47,925
Slaves fled from the south,
went north and came to rochester

398
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,885
The underground railroad
took them there,

399
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,888
and then they rehabilitated them,
put them on boats

400
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,100
and sent them to Canada
so that they could live free.

401
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,561
It's a fascinating story
for two reasons.

402
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,981
One: it reminds of there were
many good white people out there.

403
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:06,360
I often get angry at white and think later
I: "No, there is good white. Calm down."

404
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,613
And the other part that was amazing

405
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:13,992
was that they persuaded blacks
to board boats again. I think...

406
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:19,456
that it is one of the most
incredible stories I have read.

407
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:22,960
Do you know how convincing you have to be ...

408
00:23:23,594 --> 00:23:27,339
to convince anyone
Who just escaped slavery?

409
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:30,009
Think about it for a second.
Someone has just moved from slavery.

410
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,052
They finally got there,

411
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:35,222
they wake up
after a night's sleep in freedom,

412
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:40,728
and they go out saying, "I just want
thank you for everything you did for me. "

413
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:43,689
"Do you know what, my friend?
No one deserves to live as you lived,

414
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,483
I'm glad we got you out. "

415
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,860
"Thanks so much.
I appreciate you, brother. "

416
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,822
"Thank you, my friend. All we need to do now
is to fix actions,

417
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:54,408
some new clothes
and put you on a boat to Canada,

418
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,994
then you can live free.
Everything will be better. "

419
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,912
"Sorry. Wait a minute.

420
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:03,125
Yes, can you change that?

421
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,335
What did you say?"

422
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:08,297
"I know it's difficult,
but we have to fix ID documents. "

423
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,424
"No, you said about a boat?"

424
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,718
"We are setting you on a boat to Canada."

425
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:14,887
"Yes. No, I'm not ...

426
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:19,099
We do not go boat anymore. I do not know
if you know our story,

427
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:23,186
but me and my people took a cruise
once. It did not work well.

428
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:27,607
So, yes, we may find another way
to come to Canada. "

429
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,152
"Boat is the best way
to get there from Rochester. "

430
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,571
"Yes, maybe it's the best way for you.

431
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:34,114
But we go.

432
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:36,659
We can run,
We can run really well.

433
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,953
We can run,
but we do not go on any boat. "

434
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:40,746
"My friend, you have to go on the boat."

435
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:42,623
"I do not have to do a joke.

436
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:45,876
I just got free. Imagine if I'm going on
the boat and end up in the same place?

437
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:46,961
What do they say then?

438
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:50,047
"Why did you go on the boat?"
'Because he was nice.' Hell either!

439
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,173
No boat for me! "

440
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,384
"But you have to go on the boat.

441
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:56,095
You are free now.
You have to get over this. "

442
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:58,222
"One day, in a few hundred years,

443
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:02,184
maybe one of my descendants Kanye West
have come over it, but not me.

444
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
So I do not go on any boat. "

445
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:09,650
"We have to get you on the boat, hell."

446
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,943
"I do not go on any boat."

447
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:16,782
And that was the day
then the phrase "Nigger, please" was invented.

448
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,627
The white man turned around and said,
"Nigger, please, you have to go on the boat."

449
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:36,760
And that story was passed on
from generation to generation,

450
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,221
black person to black person,
free man to free man

451
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,142
"And the white man knelt down
and said, 'Nigger, please.' "

452
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:47,021
"Nigger, please?"
I have never heard that phrase in my life.

453
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:50,107
- Nigger, please ... Nigger, please.
- Nigger, please? "

454
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:55,863
I know it's probably a phrase
Barack Obama used

455
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,323
at least once in the White House.

456
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,242
At least once.

457
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,954
"Mr. President, do you think that Trump
are you wrong?

458
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:07,082
"Do you think you caused this?"
- "Nigger, please"

459
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:12,337
Only once, once.
I know he used it.

460
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,928
I actually met President Obama
during his time as president.

461
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:23,181
It's probably one of the craziest experiences
I had in my life. Yes, I was ...

462
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,184
It came completely unexpectedly.

463
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:30,230
I worked at The Daily Show
and received a call from the administration.

464
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,649
And someone at the other end said:

465
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:35,402
"Hi, Trevor. Do you want to interview
US President of the White House? "

466
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:38,447
And I thought, "Are you stupid questions?

467
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:42,117
Of course I want to meet
United States President. Are you kidding?"

468
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:44,078
And the day came finally.

469
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:46,372
I went to DC with my TV team,

470
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:47,998
They placed us in a room,

471
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:50,917
which was literally low
opposite the oval room.

472
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:53,087
We rigged all our cameras.

473
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:55,422
Then we were just waiting for the president.

474
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:58,008
We stared at the door.

475
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,470
They do not give one
President's exact arrival time,

476
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,429
for his safety.

477
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,474
They only give a period of time,
as with the cable duct.

478
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:10,270
So we're waiting everyone in there,

479
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,439
listening to every footstep, every moment,

480
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:16,110
and then he just pops in behind us
and scare the shit out of all.

481
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,946
There is a secret door,
but they do not tell either.

482
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:22,073
We are staring at the door and suddenly we hear:
"Hello".

483
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:26,578
But I had a great interview
with him.

484
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,247
He was very kind to everyone in the room.

485
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:33,502
Then we closed the cameras and he stayed
Even nicer, we just conversed.

486
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:36,755
I thought he should go.
He is president and has things to do.

487
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:39,842
But he left for a while
and we spoke like people,

488
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:44,555
and it went well
until he turned to me and said,

489
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:47,141
"Trevor, I have a show

490
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:50,269
which I will do in a few weeks,
a little thing,

491
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,105
and I thought you might
want to look past and behave. "

492
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:56,275
"Mr. President, it would be a glory.
Just say when and where.

493
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,901
What is the purpose of the show, sir? "

494
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:00,154
He said, "I'm doing a little thing
for my aides,

495
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,239
and thought you might come. "

496
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,033
I said, "Please, thank you.

497
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,951
Sorry, a show for what? "

498
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:08,411
He said, "For my aides, my coworkers.

499
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:10,330
I said:

500
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,249
"Do you have AIDS?"

501
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,423
And then...

502
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,635
Then he explained ...

503
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,304
what he meant.

504
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:31,184
And I wanted to earth
would devour myself completely.

505
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:39,859
Because I had just watched
on the US president ...

506
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,989
and asked if he had AIDS.

507
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,996
And the worst is
that he was kind to me too.

508
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:55,709
Because he explained and I said,
"Forgive me. I did not mean it.

509
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,545
I do not even know why ...
You said 'aides' and AIDS ...'

510
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:01,048
For my defense ...

511
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:02,132
I'm taking now.

512
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:04,384
He means "aides",
assistants at the White House

513
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:07,054
the people who help the president.
I'm taking now.

514
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:11,474
But where I come from is AIDS
Anything else that does not help anyone.

515
00:29:11,942 --> 00:29:15,854
No one in Africa walks around and says,
"Let me introduce you to my AIDS."

516
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:20,734
I'm crushed and saying:
"I'm terribly sorry, president.

517
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,779
I did not mean it. You do not have AIDS,
and even if you had AIDS,

518
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,448
then nothing is wrong with that.
No stigma.

519
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,575
I do not know what I'm saying. Sorry."

520
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,536
"Trevor, calm down."

521
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:31,829
Trevor Trevor, calm down. "

522
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:34,206
"I am terribly sorry,
I should not have said that.

523
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,875
I'm probably the dumbest you met. "
"No, Trevor ..."

524
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,086
"I'm the dumbest one you've ever met."

525
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:42,672
He said, "No, Trevor, that's not true.
I've met Trump. "

526
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:45,300
Stop it!

527
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:51,097
So witty.

528
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,894
But I'm used to it in life.

529
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:59,898
This happens to me often,
since I lived in the United States.

530
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:03,318
I understand it as an idea.
If you move to another country,

531
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,529
so one must learn
another language.

532
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,574
I did not realize that would happen
In the United States, because I speak English.

533
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:11,868
But here people speak American.
Similar, but not the same.

534
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,788
Small things are different.

535
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:16,874
I accept that,
small things like pronunciation.

536
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:20,627
For example, what you drink,
I call it "water".

537
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:23,046
Water. In American
do you say "wadder".

538
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:24,506
Right? "Wadder". Yes.

539
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,676
I say "water"
because there is a T in the word.

540
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:31,847
The glass you look at each morning

541
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,932
I call for a mirror.

542
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,101
In American you say "Ameer".

543
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:37,936
"Ameer." That's not the same for me.

544
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,606
"A mirror" is the glass.
Ameer is a man in the Middle East.

545
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:41,899
Very different experiences.

546
00:30:41,949 --> 00:30:43,692
It's not the same.

547
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:46,569
And that's just the pronunciation.

548
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,699
You must also learn the meaning
in words you already could

549
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,452
when moving to the United States.
For example, where I come from

550
00:30:53,502 --> 00:30:56,330
is there a garment
which men often wear under his shirt.

551
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,457
It's white and sleeveless.

552
00:30:58,507 --> 00:31:01,043
Where I'm from
we call it "west".

553
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:01,960
Okay?

554
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,714
In america it is called "wife beater"
wife beater.

555
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:09,551
Yes, I have so many questions.

556
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:14,806
My best and worst experience
when it comes to learning American

557
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:17,684
happened when I first moved to the United States.

558
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:22,105
I lived in California, in Pasadena,
when I first came to the United States.

559
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:24,691
The reason I lived in Pasadena is

560
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:27,027
that it was where I felt
my first american friend,

561
00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:28,528
a guy named David Meyer.

562
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:32,366
He came to South Africa to film
a documentary, and we became good friends.

563
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:36,035
One day we stayed in Dave's apartment.

564
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,498
Dave sat in his seat bag
and looked at me and said,

565
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:43,001
"Trevor, the polar ...

566
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:46,671
I do not know how it is with you
right now,

567
00:31:46,847 --> 00:31:49,090
but I soon die of starvation. "

568
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,010
I said:

569
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:54,971
"You mean you're hungry, Dave."

570
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:56,848
"What?"

571
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:59,559
"It does not matter, what do you want to eat?"

572
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,188
He said, "Do you know what I'm craving?

573
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:05,398
I'm crazy about tacos. "

574
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,734
I said, "That sounds fun.

575
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:09,527
We are going to Tacos. "

576
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:11,821
"What?"

577
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:16,576
"Is not that the restaurant you're craving?
Tacos? "

578
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,704
"Do you mean seriousness right now?

579
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,249
Have you never eaten tacos? "

580
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:26,586
"No, I do not know what tacos are."

581
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:30,340
"Have you never eaten tacos?"

582
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:35,053
"My response has not changed since now, Dave.
No.

583
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,682
"I have never eaten tacos."
"Have you never tasted tacos?"

584
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:40,934
By the way, I apologize when people do.

585
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:43,228
When they ask the same question
over and over again,

586
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,898
because they can not imagine not
have had exactly the same life experience.

587
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,318
"Hello, have you heard Beyonce's new?"

588
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,987
- "No."
- "Have not you heard Beyoncé's new?"

589
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,448
- "No I have not..."
- "Have not you heard ...?"

590
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:57,492
"Well, now I have it."

591
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,955
No, I had never eaten tacos.

592
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:05,542
In South Africa we are not right
Mexican food.

593
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:10,338
We do not have any Mexicans.
They never came over, it's not my fault.

594
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:14,926
Dave was personally insulted.

595
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:17,971
I never forget that,
he jumped up and said,

596
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:22,100
"I do not think you've been in the United States
so long and never ate tacos. "

597
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,810
"Why is that such a big thing?"

598
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,647
"Because, Trevor,
nothing is as American as tacos. "

599
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,237
"Really?" I said.

600
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:37,824
"Is nothing so American
like Mexican food? "

601
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,204
The funny thing is
that at that moment I knew

602
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,289
that Dave was a deeper man.

603
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:49,294
He did not even realize it, but it was
a deeply small gold cliff.

604
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:51,922
"Nothing is as Amean as tacos."

605
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:55,634
I have had the privilege of traveling
everywhere in this beautiful country.

606
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:58,428
I've been to places
like Erie in Pennsylvania,

607
00:33:58,478 --> 00:34:00,889
El Paso, Texas, Honolulu, Hawaii.

608
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,892
I've been everywhere,
and one thing that I have learned,

609
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,810
generally in the usa ...

610
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:09,147
is that americans ...

611
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:10,774
love ...

612
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:12,692
tacos.

613
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,571
Wherever you go,

614
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,534
so love american tacos.

615
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,410
Love tacos

616
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:26,498
Even totally unexpected people.
I watched the news one day,

617
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,583
and they showed a guy at a mass meeting,

618
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,587
and they asked him about immigration
and families that were divorced, etc.

619
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:38,135
And this guy, whatever his policy,
was a mean, xenophobic racist.

620
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:40,137
Very presidential.

621
00:34:40,187 --> 00:34:42,513
And the journalist asked him ...

622
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,725
The journalist asked him about children,

623
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,311
and he answered directly:
"I'll tell you,

624
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:51,189
I do not care about it
here damn the Mexicans.

625
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,858
They came here. They should not be here.

626
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:59,822
It's our country now, do you hear that? Right.
Go back where you came from.

627
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:05,871
These Mexicans have not done well.
They have not brought anything good to the United States.

628
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:07,038
Come on, Bubba.

629
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:09,666
It's taco Tuesday. "

630
00:35:14,596 --> 00:35:17,215
Stick from here, but leave the recipe.

631
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,428
There should be a rule in the United States

632
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:24,639
which says you can hate
immigrants how much you want,

633
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,642
but if you do,
you should not eat their food.

634
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:28,935
Or?

635
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:33,106
I think that is fair.

636
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:36,943
Do you hate immigrants,
no immigrant.

637
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:40,280
And when I say no immigrant food,
so I do not mean anyone.

638
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:44,701
No mexican food, no western Indian food,
no Dominican food, no Asian food.

639
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,203
Just potatoes.

640
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:54,794
And I do not even mean flavored potatoes.
Just potatoes like it is.

641
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:56,295
No spices.

642
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,757
For no immigrant, no spice.
Never forget that.

643
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:03,011
Both figuratively and literally,
no seasoning.

644
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,681
And I know some would take it.
I know people who would say:

645
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,601
"Take your immigrants, take your spices
and stay out of here for the fan. "

646
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:12,979
You're saying that now ...

647
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:17,358
because you've never lived a life
without seasoning.

648
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,861
But never forget.

649
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:24,032
A life without spices was so difficult ...

650
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,242
so hard...

651
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:30,872
that it got white people
to sail around the world to find them.

652
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:35,626
And so ...

653
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:44,093
This was not common sailing,
There was no Disney cruise.

654
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:48,681
These people sailed for a while
when they thought that if you sailed this way,

655
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,643
one would fall from the ground and die.

656
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:55,354
And yet...

657
00:36:56,072 --> 00:36:58,066
was there anybody out there

658
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:02,695
who ate some white women's food and said,
"I do not stand out with this shit!

659
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,323
I'm going to say that. "

660
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,034
"Imagine if you die"

661
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:10,369
"It's at least exciting."

662
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,749
No immigrants,

663
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:16,209
no spices.

664
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,378
And definitely no tacos.

665
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:22,924
Dave would never allow it.
He was so passionate.

666
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:27,387
He spoke about tacos as if he were
were heirs to a tacodynasty.

667
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:30,348
In the end he said:
"As your friend and as an American,

668
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:34,727
I'll make sure you get tacos
if that's the last thing I do! "

669
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:38,689
"Why not now, Dave?" I said.
"It works," he said.

670
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:43,236
I love when somebody believes
that you intend to mess with them,

671
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:46,072
but you agree with them
and they have already chosen anger.

672
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,035
For nobody just changes his tone.

673
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:54,205
Everyone must hold on for a while,
because they think they seem less crazy then.

674
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:58,043
It happens even in relationships.
You have a noise that is not a fuss.

675
00:37:58,093 --> 00:38:00,879
"To hell, Karen,
every time I ask for your support,

676
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:03,131
then you're not there,
and sometimes it hurts me. "

677
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,759
"I'm sorry, Bob."
- "No, do not try ... Thank you very much.

678
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,554
I was not expecting an apology
so I chose this tone,

679
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:11,639
and now I feel like an idiot.

680
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,850
I leave the room and change. "

681
00:38:18,655 --> 00:38:21,232
I did not want to bother, I wanted tacos.

682
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:23,109
We go and eat tacos, Dave.

683
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:25,695
So we jumped into the car.

684
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:29,615
We drove for around 20 minutes.

685
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,453
To what I thought
would become a restaurant.

686
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,291
Instead...

687
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:40,543
does dave stay

688
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:43,588
in a deserted parking lot.

689
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:52,972
He turns off the engine, looks at me
saying, "Okay, buddy. Here it is."

690
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:57,685
I say, "Where were you at my murder place?"

691
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:00,772
"No, we're going to buy tacos, over there."

692
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,524
He points,
and in the corner of the parking lot is a car.

693
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,861
A food car,
which I have learned is common in the United States.

694
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,907
Food cars have some of the best food,
but just then, you have to excuse me

695
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,867
I was a little suspicious.

696
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,663
Okay. I was not comfortable with the thought of
to buy food from an establishment

697
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:19,415
which would not be there the next day.

698
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,754
I feel that resistance results
a certain amount of accountability.

699
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,427
But Dave said,
"You have to eat them from a car.

700
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:31,761
Then they know they are genuine. "

701
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:34,472
"Okay, let's get over it," I said.

702
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:38,184
So I went to the food car,
and it was definitely a tacobil,

703
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:41,562
because there was a flashed sign hanging over it
where it was called "tacos".

704
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,147
tacos

705
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:44,982
Tacos.

706
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,778
By the way, a little peculiarity I have:

707
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:52,240
I hate signs that flash
without changing text.

708
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,325
Yes, I always feel

709
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,996
that a sign should not blink
if it does not change information.

710
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:02,333
Otherwise, it's a waste of excitement.
It should be illegal.

711
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,337
It always catches my gaze and then
I'm waiting for something more. "Tacos"

712
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:09,507
and ... tacos. "And what more?" Tacos. "

713
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:10,633
Anything else? "Tacos."

714
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:12,551
Just stop at tacos!

715
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:15,513
Anyway, now I'm annoyed.

716
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:18,099
I'm going to get my car to the car.
A little guy looks.

717
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,393
He was in a different mood than me.

718
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:24,772
You saw that. He stabbed his head:
"Hi, the situation? Do you want tacos?"

719
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:27,900
I said, "It would be cowardly
if we did not want it. "

720
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:32,489
He said, "What? Yes. Of course, man,
but you never know.

721
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:34,032
You may want something else. "

722
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:35,784
I said, "What are you more, my friend?"

723
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,452
He said, "No, man.
It's a tacobil. "

724
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:41,831
"Thank you," I said.

725
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:44,584
"It's a while in my life
I never get back. Thanks."

726
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,878
He said, "No, no, no.
Calma-te, men.

727
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:48,671
I do not want to waste your time.

728
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:51,508
If you want tacos you will have tacos.
How many do you want?"

729
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:55,136
I said, "I do not know.
I have never eaten tacos. "

730
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,430
"Have you never eaten tacos?"

731
00:40:58,648 --> 00:41:02,060
- "I said no.
"Have you never eaten tacos?"

732
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,895
"You should meet my friend Dave," I said.

733
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:08,858
I do not intend to order food
when I do not know what it is.

734
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,235
I do not know anything about the quantities.

735
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:12,153
I do not know what tacos are.

736
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:16,157
What do you say? How many are you taking?
I might say, "Give me five."

737
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,577
But think if tacos are little pigs or something,
and I say, "Give me five!"

738
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:21,620
Then I suddenly go home with ...

739
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:28,461
"And that's how I started my farm."
I have no idea what they are.

740
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:33,383
So I say: "Just give me a taste."
"Okay," he says.

741
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:35,426
"Then two tacos are enough."

742
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:36,845
"Okay, give me two tacos."

743
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:39,180
"Two tacos will be!"

744
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:41,515
The guy goes in ...

745
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,601
and start cooking the food.

746
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:46,187
I have no idea
what comes out

747
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:50,275
He will return after a while:
"My friend. Your tacos are ready."

748
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,901
"Thank you very much," I say.

749
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,778
"Yes, do you want a napkin?"

750
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,323
"Sorry, how did you say?"
- "Do you want a napkin?"

751
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,288
And now, L.A.,

752
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:09,043
It is now getting strange to me.

753
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:14,590
Because you understand where I'm from ...

754
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:20,554
is a "napkin" that baby wears ...

755
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,560
to keep their shit.

756
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:34,485
The thing man wipes his mouth with
we call napkins.

757
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:39,782
But I did not know that,
so this man had turned to me,

758
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,701
offered me food and then said:

759
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,246
"Do you want a napkin?"

760
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,044
I said, "Sorry, I'm confused.

761
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,880
Why would I like it? "

762
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,674
"You know, for the suit afterwards."

763
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:03,514
He said the draft.

764
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,102
"How soon will I need one soon afterwards?"

765
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:11,522
"You never know with tacos.

766
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:15,359
One minute you think you'll fix it,
and next it's going out. "

767
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:19,781
"It sounds like the disgusting one
I heard something. "

768
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:23,451
He said, "No, that's part
of the experience. Everyone is doing it.

769
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:27,121
You are worn, you wipe off,
and then you try again. "

770
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,791
I said, "It's an experience
I do not want to.

771
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,043
- I'll skip it. "
"Do not you taste my food?"

772
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:35,505
"Sure, I taste the food.
But I do not take your napkin.

773
00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:37,006
"What are you going to do?"

774
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:38,633
"If it's as crazy as you say

775
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,511
so I only eat my taco
in the car on my way home. "

776
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:44,555
"Well, you think you're sure",
he says.

777
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,892
You will drive.

778
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:52,271
Then slipping someone so you have to brake,
and it goes out.

779
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:56,317
Do not be a hero.

780
00:43:57,618 --> 00:43:59,153
Just take the napkin. "

781
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,155
"I'm not trying to be a hero," I said.

782
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,491
"I'm just an adult damn man. Okay?

783
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:07,036
If it's really bad, I'll just scratch
super hard until I arrive. "

784
00:44:07,086 --> 00:44:08,496
He said, "That's the problem.

785
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:12,917
Some do not know, they're cracking too hard,
and then the juice flows out even more.

786
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:16,671
It can splash on the pants and the sweater ... "

787
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,130
"On my shirt?

788
00:44:18,431 --> 00:44:21,009
"How the hell is shit
right up to my shirt? "

789
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:25,054
Does it bump it up from the ground?
What the hell are you here? "

790
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:29,225
- "Do you want your napkin or not?"
"I do not even know the tacos right now."

791
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:37,107
So much stress.

792
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:44,156
Now I love tacos.

793
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:57,211
I love tacos.
I love Mexican food.

794
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,213
I love Mexican people.

795
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:07,597
I do not even know what it is.
We have a relationship.

796
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:09,015
South Africans and Mexicans.

797
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:11,809
People from skithål countries. We have a thing.

798
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:19,650
I still can not believe the things
Donald Trump says.

799
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:23,821
To me is Donald Trump
an emotional paradox.

800
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:28,076
Logically, I can melt him,
emotionally receives it.

801
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,829
On the one hand, I wake up many days
terrified at the thought of

802
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:34,790
that he is president
in the world's most powerful nation.

803
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:37,960
But I also wake up many days

804
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,588
and know that he will get me
to laugh.

805
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:44,383
It's terror and joy,
and I do not know how to feel.

806
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:47,095
Do you know how it sometimes feels?

807
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:50,056
Like a giant asteroid
is heading towards the earth.

808
00:45:50,106 --> 00:45:52,266
But it is shaped like a penis.

809
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:57,354
I think I'll die.

810
00:45:57,613 --> 00:45:59,982
But I know I'll laugh.

811
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,239
Just look at everything he does.

812
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:08,366
The world we now live in because of him.

813
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,951
We pass on history.

814
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:13,579
This never happens
in our lifetime again.

815
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:18,042
We live for a while
when we all learn about the presidency ...

816
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:22,212
at the same time as the president.
It never happened.

817
00:46:24,223 --> 00:46:26,425
How crazy is that concept?

818
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:31,764
You wake up everyday and read the news
and thinking: "Oh, I did not know."

819
00:46:31,814 --> 00:46:34,350
And at least, at exactly the same time,

820
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:38,312
he reads the same news
and thinking: "Oh, not me either."

821
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,860
And no one knows where it will lead,
what he will do.

822
00:46:44,994 --> 00:46:48,156
All we know is that he wants his wall.
He wants his wall.

823
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:50,616
Donald Trump wants his wall.

824
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:54,162
He needs $ 25 billion
last time he asked.

825
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:58,165
He needs it from American
taxpayer, for Mexico is smart.

826
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:00,793
It went very quickly.

827
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:04,005
Do you remember how confident he was
at the mass meetings? People cheered.

828
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:06,090
He said, "Good people,

829
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:08,050
we are going to build ...

830
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:11,387
a wall.

831
00:47:14,815 --> 00:47:17,142
We're going to build a wall, everybody.

832
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:19,145
Who will pay?

833
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:20,896
Mexico. "

834
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:24,817
Mexico said:
"We do not pay for a shit."

835
00:47:30,873 --> 00:47:33,909
We may build it,
but we do not pay for it. "

836
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,001
Mur history is enough
the best TV comedy.

837
00:47:42,051 --> 00:47:45,922
For now, they have begun to build prototypes
of the wall at the border,

838
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:48,466
for Donald Trump wants
that they test the wall first.

839
00:47:48,516 --> 00:47:50,092
I do not know how to do it.

840
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:52,219
Should they say "try again"?

841
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:57,266
And because of the prototypes have
Now trump up specifications for the wall.

842
00:47:57,316 --> 00:48:00,645
He now wants the wall to be built
of concrete,

843
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:03,397
but it must also be transparent.

844
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,565
Okay.

845
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:09,111
And the reason for it is that he is afraid

846
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:12,949
to drug addicts from Mexico
will push bags with knots over the wall,

847
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:16,160
and that they meet
passers-by Americans in the head.

848
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:23,792
So the wall must be transparent
so that Americans can see the drugs come ...

849
00:48:23,843 --> 00:48:25,377
and catch them.

850
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:32,634
I do not know what a translucent wall is.

851
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:37,181
But now I'm just worried
that any builder should fool the president.

852
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,768
That he takes him to the border and says:
"There it is, Mr. Trump.

853
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,436
Your invisible wall. "

854
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:51,946
And because he will buy it
Does he hire Mexican pantomimes?

855
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,656
"Lord, you will not come through.

856
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:01,246
It works."

857
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:06,502
Donald Trumps brain.

858
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:08,504
The other idea he had for the wall

859
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:11,173
where the United States should build the wall
of solar panels.

860
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:12,341
That's what he said.

861
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:15,678
He said that the United States should build the wall
of solar panels

862
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:18,139
for then the wall would generate electricity

863
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,015
and pay for themselves.

864
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:21,684
I will not lie.

865
00:49:21,734 --> 00:49:23,352
That's a good idea.

866
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:24,895
That's a good idea,

867
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:28,941
unless you know anything about solar panels,
the sun or the walls.

868
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:33,154
The problem with that idea is
that the sun is above us.

869
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,906
Yes? Are we all united there?

870
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:38,367
The sun is above us, right?

871
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,954
A solar panel wall does not work,
for a wall is upright.

872
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:44,081
It points downwards.

873
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,252
So if you do not have a really sunny sun
which says, "I'll shine really low",

874
00:49:48,302 --> 00:49:50,003
it does not work.

875
00:49:52,515 --> 00:49:55,051
It just works
if you take your border sun panel

876
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:58,929
and leans it to catch the sun rays,
but then you have created a giant ramp

877
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,098
for Mexicans to enter the United States.

878
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:03,350
"Ora le ..."

879
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:11,316
Donald J. Tumps intellect.

880
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:13,361
The one stands for Jesus.

881
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:15,279
Many do not know that.

882
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,032
There is a lot of self-esteem there.

883
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:26,582
And he's always looking for someone.
If it's not Mexicans, it's Muslims.

884
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:30,002
Are not Muslims,
so it's Africans from skithål countries.

885
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:33,297
It was my personal favorite,
because i am african

886
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:35,632
and I've dumped in a hole.

887
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:41,138
I liked it too
because people came up and asked questions.

888
00:50:41,188 --> 00:50:45,184
A man arrived after a show
very concerned. He said, "You, Trevor,

889
00:50:45,234 --> 00:50:47,019
can I ask something?"

890
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:48,979
"Yes, please, my friend."

891
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:51,065
He said, "Trevor, I just wanted to know,

892
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:54,902
when Donald Trump says
all these terribly racist things,

893
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:58,322
do you sometimes want to just pack, leave the USA,

894
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:01,700
go back to South Africa
and escape from all this racism? "

895
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:10,167
"My friend," I said,

896
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,629
"You do not go to South Africa
to escape from racism.

897
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:16,214
That's what your husband is going to fill. "

898
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,386
Are you kidding? That's the only thing
which reminds me of home.

899
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,263
Rasismen out here.

900
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:26,517
We have a lot of racism in South Africa.

901
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,769
Do not misunderstand
It has become much better.

902
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,939
When I grew up, we had Apartheid.

903
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:35,817
And apartheid was basically
the world's best racism.

904
00:51:35,951 --> 00:51:39,697
Sorry, I did not mean to say that.
Now you think: "Our racism was the best."

905
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:42,741
No, it was not.
It was good, but not the best.

906
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:47,663
I experienced a lot of racism,
it did all.

907
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:51,167
I never felt it was bad,
mostly because of my family.

908
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:55,796
My mother is a black woman,
a Xhosa woman, my father is a Swiss,

909
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,923
and it was illegal for them
to be a couple,

910
00:51:57,973 --> 00:52:00,759
and that was a problem
that we lived together.

911
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:02,344
So we experienced a lot of racism.

912
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:06,515
And if you wonder ... yes.
Xhosa is one of the languages ​​with the click.

913
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:13,230
But not like in American movies,
Just to let you know.

914
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:16,817
I have watched the movies
where they have Africans like ...

915
00:52:21,956 --> 00:52:23,782
There is no language.

916
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:28,578
Even we are watching the movies and thinking:
"I wonder what they are saying.

917
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,333
Where do they come from?"

918
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,793
"I think they are from Cleveland?"

919
00:52:38,347 --> 00:52:42,175
The clicks are consonants.
We still have vowels.

920
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,637
I grew up in a family
who could not live together.

921
00:52:44,687 --> 00:52:48,265
Dad could not live with us.
It was illegal.

922
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:51,685
People were even racist against us,
but I was lucky when I grew up,

923
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,564
for my mother is probably one of the most
hard-barked people you've ever met.

924
00:52:55,614 --> 00:52:57,566
Nothing affected her.

925
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,443
Nothing bothered her.

926
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:04,698
I especially remember one day,
then we walked along the street together.

927
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:08,160
And one guy on the other side of the street
shouted something ugly itll us.

928
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,496
I was four or five years old,

929
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:13,498
and I looked at my mother and said,
"Mother,

930
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:17,169
what do we do about people
do racism go against us? "

931
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:20,881
And mom said, "Do you know what we are doing
if anyone is racist?

932
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,175
We take their racism,

933
00:53:23,517 --> 00:53:27,179
and shakes about it
with jesus love

934
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:30,807
And then we'll send it back. "

935
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:34,061
And I said, "What?

936
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,356
"The woman is crazy," I thought.

937
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:44,613
She was crazy,

938
00:53:45,247 --> 00:53:46,991
but she was also right.

939
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,994
I did not realize how right she had
until decades later.

940
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:52,538
Which I always know happens
with one's parents.

941
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:55,749
They are crazy, and then they reach their age
and thinking:

942
00:53:57,217 --> 00:53:59,294
"That's what it means."

943
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:03,966
I taught my homework my homework
tried to teach me first as an adult man.

944
00:54:04,016 --> 00:54:06,676
I walked on the streets of Chicago.

945
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,429
I handled myself.

946
00:54:09,772 --> 00:54:14,810
Any guy drove past in a pickup
and called me the N word.

947
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,564
And I will not lie.
I was disappointed.

948
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,943
Mostly because he drove a pickup.

949
00:54:23,535 --> 00:54:25,738
I just feel
that it was an unnecessary stereotype

950
00:54:25,788 --> 00:54:28,198
which he did not need to maintain.

951
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:32,828
If you are to be racist, do something different.

952
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:34,871
Think beyond the frames.

953
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:36,581
Run a Prius.

954
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:39,000
Yes.

955
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:44,840
It's better for the environment, and it's quiet.
You can sneak on me. We both win.

956
00:54:45,683 --> 00:54:48,927
But no, the guy drove a pickup,

957
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:50,429
called me the N word and ...

958
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:53,641
To give you the whole story,
Then I went to the red old man.

959
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,601
It does not justify what he did,

960
00:54:55,651 --> 00:55:00,147
I just want you to know
that I'm not an angel. Okay?

961
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:04,485
I crossed the street
and then it became red light,

962
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:08,029
but I decided to go anyway
because I do not see color.

963
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,077
And this man ...

964
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:17,623
This man became so insulted
of what I had done

965
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:21,210
that he drove his pickup around me,
rolled down the box, met my eyesight

966
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,087
and said, "Out of the way, nigger."

967
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:27,465
And he saw that he would hurt me.

968
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:29,927
We kept each other's eyes shut
and you saw

969
00:55:29,977 --> 00:55:32,179
that he was waiting for me to ...

970
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:44,566
But he did not know ...

971
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:47,068
where i came from

972
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,279
Even more important,

973
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,031
he did not know...

974
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:53,366
who my mom was.

975
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:59,080
Because he thought it would just be
a regular racist day.

976
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:06,505
He thought he would throw himself away
N-word and move on.

977
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:10,508
He did not realize that it was Patricia's son
who stepped out on the street.

978
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:14,304
And it happened in a moment,

979
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:16,139
but lasted a lifetime.

980
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:20,810
Because I did not even think.
He just shouted the word and my body ...

981
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:28,360
I thought, "damn it's happening!"

982
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:34,575
And let me tell you, L.A.,

983
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,910
it was so amazing
because I did not plan.

984
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,580
I did not think of that.
I stepped out on the street,

985
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,708
he drove his pickup around me,
rolled down the box and looked at me:

986
00:56:42,758 --> 00:56:44,334
"Out of the way, nigger."

987
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:47,295
And I turned around and said,
"Yo, my nigga."

988
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:55,512
And he almost crashed and died.

989
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:58,974
I've never seen anyone
question yourself

990
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:01,018
so many times in a fraction of a second.

991
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:05,689
Before I logged in, I saw that he thought:
"Do I know you?"

992
00:57:05,948 --> 00:57:07,608
"Do I look like you know?"

993
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:12,445
And I do not know why he did
this, but he looked at his hands.

994
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:21,121
He looked at his hands as if they were
in a magic manner, had become black.

995
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:25,250
As if I had cast a curse.
I do not know what he was thinking.

996
00:57:28,554 --> 00:57:30,922
I actually felt sorry for him.

997
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:35,218
Because I've been called that word before
but that was his first time.

998
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,680
You never forget your first time.

999
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,184
Sorry, but is that what he wants?

1000
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:44,228
Will he call me that?
and ruin my day?

1001
00:57:44,278 --> 00:57:48,148
He calls me "nigger"
and I'm gonna talk about it?

1002
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:51,068
I do not have time for it.
My mom always said

1003
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:53,070
that you can not control
what people do,

1004
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,155
but you can check
how to react.

1005
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,406
So I promised myself.

1006
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,868
"A racist should never have the pleasure
in seeing my pain. "

1007
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:01,453
It must be painful,

1008
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:04,622
but I do not give them the pleasure
to see my pain

1009
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,420
Does anyone say anything racist,

1010
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:14,382
Then I take racism, shaking it
with Jesus love and throw it back.

1011
00:58:15,183 --> 00:58:16,802
It's not always easy.

1012
00:58:16,852 --> 00:58:19,888
Not everyone can do it.
Not everyone should.

1013
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,183
I understand too
that it is a bit different for me.

1014
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,352
I'm from a country

1015
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:28,897
where the word "nigger" never used
to repress someone.

1016
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:30,691
We had another word,

1017
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:33,694
because we had the best racism.
Come on. But not that word.

1018
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,988
The word we had was the word "kaffir".

1019
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:40,200
So another word, but the same thing.
It seems crazy for me sometimes.

1020
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,786
Same racism, another word.

1021
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,373
And here it does not matter, right?
"Kaffir"? Nothing.

1022
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:50,001
Some wonder: "Is there any probiotics?
Is that what it is? "

1023
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:53,171
Yes, the probiotic of my pain.

1024
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:57,217
We do not have it in our supermarkets,
for obvious reasons.

1025
00:58:57,351 --> 00:58:58,635
Nobody warned me in the United States.

1026
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:02,347
I go there among the milk products
and thinking: "Yogurt, ice cream ...

1027
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,393
This lactose is intolerant. "

1028
00:59:12,032 --> 00:59:14,693
So there are different around the world.
I get that.

1029
00:59:14,743 --> 00:59:18,613
It's a privilege I have
when it comes to dealing with the N word.

1030
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,158
In South Africa, nobody was called "nigger".

1031
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:24,161
All over Africa no one was oppressed
with that word.

1032
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:25,996
So that word has no power.

1033
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:28,874
Wherever you go.
"Nigger, nigger, nigger ..." Nothing.

1034
00:59:28,924 --> 00:59:32,252
While I can now feel the excitement
here in the room.

1035
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:36,339
Some think: "For hell,
was it seven times? I'm taking, Trevor.

1036
00:59:36,556 --> 00:59:38,967
That's my annual quota. Come on."

1037
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:41,761
I get it.

1038
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:44,681
It made me think
that we may be able to use it.

1039
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:47,309
We can use it
to help each other

1040
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:51,271
and create a program that you send
all your racists to Africa

1041
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,981
only once a year.

1042
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:55,484
For Africans, they will be tight.

1043
00:59:55,534 --> 01:00:00,030
The best part is that you do not even
need to wait. There are black everywhere.

1044
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,200
Just jump straight and scream: "Nigger!"

1045
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,995
Since Africa is run and owned by black,
then they are not afraid of white.

1046
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:10,498
They will only say:
"Jimbo, he's back. Nigger man.

1047
01:00:12,134 --> 01:00:13,877
How are you nigger? "

1048
01:00:15,303 --> 01:00:17,381
"To hell, you're the kidney."

1049
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,384
"But you are always saying that,
nigger-art.

1050
01:00:20,434 --> 01:00:22,177
Yes, your nigger.

1051
01:00:22,227 --> 01:00:25,889
Apply some sunscreen cream
before you die, nigger. Now we're partying. "

1052
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:34,939
It would be different.
That's all I say.

1053
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:38,985
It's always strange to me,

1054
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:41,655
because no one used the word
in a derogatory manner

1055
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:44,741
so the word "nigger" exists in South Africa.

1056
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:46,743
But in the mother tongue, Xhosa,

1057
01:00:46,752 --> 01:00:49,245
means the word "nigga" "to give".

1058
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,249
That's what "nigga" means on Xhosa.

1059
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:54,042
That's how to use it.

1060
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,719
So not enough that the word does not hurt me,
when racists use it against me,

1061
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:06,763
it just evokes
nice childhood memories.

1062
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,684
I get memories of when I was a child.

1063
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,853
I was playing with my cousin
and his toy cars.

1064
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:14,730
I always stole his. I had none.

1065
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,856
He began to scream ...

1066
01:01:18,283 --> 01:01:22,112
Mom came running and said:
"Whats happening here?"

1067
01:01:22,162 --> 01:01:23,821
And my cousin said,

1068
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:25,240
"Aunt..."

1069
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:33,873
"Do you hear!

1070
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:36,960
Talk properly. I do not hear you.
What happened?"

1071
01:01:37,135 --> 01:01:38,754
"Trevor stole my toys."

1072
01:01:38,804 --> 01:01:41,715
And mom said, "Trevor, you stole
your cousin's toys? "

1073
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,426
I said, "No, mom, I do not stole.
I promise.

1074
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:48,346
"Trevor ... Do not lie to me?
Do you stole the toys? "

1075
01:01:48,396 --> 01:01:50,015
"No, I'm not stolen," I said.

1076
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:53,184
"What happened was his cars
was illegally parked.

1077
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,773
So I got to wire them because you can not
live in a society without laws.

1078
01:01:57,823 --> 01:02:01,442
I'm just a humble official
after all.

1079
01:02:01,535 --> 01:02:05,739
Without laws, it will be chaos, mom.
That's all that keeps us up.

1080
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,492
As a civilization, it is the only one
that keeps us ... "

1081
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:09,493
"Listen!" She said.

1082
01:02:09,543 --> 01:02:12,036
"Do not come here and be cheeky.

1083
01:02:12,379 --> 01:02:13,914
Give back the toys. "

1084
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,624
"Mom, please. I just want to play ..."

1085
01:02:19,052 --> 01:02:21,546
"Give back the toys."

1086
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:24,048
- "Mom ..."
- "Listen! Nigga!"

1087
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,598
And my cousin sat there:
"Nigga, please."

1088
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:37,395
L.A., you were really fun tonight.

1089
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,444
Thank you very much for coming here.

1090
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:47,697
I appreciate you all so much.

1091
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,991
Have a good evening, everyone.
