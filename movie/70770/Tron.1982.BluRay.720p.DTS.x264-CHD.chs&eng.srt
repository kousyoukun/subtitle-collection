1
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,707
给我点空间 这下好了
All right, give me room. Here we go.

00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,265
- 这个游戏叫什么名字？ - 轻型摩托
- What's this game called? - This is Lightcycle.

3
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,824
见鬼！
Damn.

4
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,843
你正变得更加野蛮 萨克
You're getting brutal, Sark.

5
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:55,095
无谓的残酷成性
Brutal and needlessly sadistic.

6
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,681
谢谢 主控制
Thank you, Master Control.

7
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,684
我们截获了一些军事程序
We have kidnapped some military programs.

8
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:03,354
我可以安排更多的致命比赛
I can arrange more lethal matches.

9
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:05,606
- 有兴趣吗？ - 当然
- Interested? - Sure.

10
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,192
我很乐意和他们中的一位比比
I'd love to go up against one of those guys.

11
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:13,113
从那些会计泡沫程序中中断一个给我
It'd make a nice break from those accounting cream puffs you keep sending me.

12
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:17,451
- 是什么分支？ - 战略空军指令
- What branch of the service? - Strategic Air Command.

13
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:19,453
很好！
Nice.

14
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:23,207
听着 这完全是一场误会
Hey, look. This is all a mistake.

15
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,501
我只是一个复合利息程序
I am just a compound interest program.

16
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,962
我的工作是储蓄和借贷 我无法玩那些电视游戏
I work at a savings and loan. I can't play these video games.

17
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:32,466
你当然可以 你看上去像一个天生的运动员
Sure you can, pal. You look like a natural athlete if I ever saw one.

18
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,468
谁 我吗？你在开玩笑？
Who, me? Are you kidding?

19
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:37,554
我正在核算短期国库券利率 我只是出来透口气
I went out to check on T-bill rates, I get out of breath.

20
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:40,808
你们这样会让我的用户亨德森先生非常生气
Hey, look. You guys are going to make my User, Mr. Henderson, very angry.

21
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:44,853
- 他可是一个完整分支机构的经理 - 很好 另一个宗教狂热
- He's a full branch manager. - Great. Another religious nut.

22
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:52,319
我应该说“欢迎 朋友” 但不是在这里 不象这样
I'd say, "Welcome, friend", but not here, not like this.

23
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,530
我不知道自己怎么会到这里的
I don't even know what I am doing here.

24
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,701
你是存在于“用户”系统中的吗？
Do you believe in the Users?

25
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:03,330
那当然了 如果没有用户 谁写了我？
Yeah, sure. If I don't have a User, then who wrote me?

26
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,332
那就是为什么你会在这里的原因
That's what you're doing here.

27
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:09,378
主控制程序夺取了我们这些程序
Master Control Program's been snapping up all us programs who believe.

28
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:12,464
如果你是有用的 他就夺取你所有的功能而变得更强大
If he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger.

29
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:16,844
如果他不能利用你 就送你到这里来受苦
If he can't use you, he sends you down here to the game grid get your bits blasted.

30
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,721
- 你叫什么名字？ - 克罗姆
- What's your name? - Crom.

31
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:22,224
我是拉姆
I am Ram.

32
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,435
他们会训练你来玩这个游戏
They will train you for the games, but...

33
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:28,397
但是… 我希望你能做到
I hope you make it.

34
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,067
别的部门变成什么样了？
Hey, what's been going on in the other sectors?

35
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,695
我已经被关在这200个周期了
I have been stuck here for 200 microcycles.

36
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,365
外面简直是在谋杀
It's murder out there.

37
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,784
没有主控制程序的允许…
You can't even travel around in your own microcircuits...

38
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:44,663
你无法进入自己的微电路
without permission from Master Control Program.

39
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,999
把我送到这里来玩游戏
I mean, sending me down here to play games.

40
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,293
他认为自己是谁啊？
Who does he calculate he is?

41
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,555
真实世界的同时


42
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,217
好吧 克鲁
Okay, Clu,

43
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,678
今天我们来检查所有右手列的数据
tonight we check everything in the right-hand column.

44
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,058
来吧 来吧 你在哪里？
Come on. Come on. Where are you?

45
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:07,060
- 你在这里 克鲁？ - 是的 先生
- There you are. Clu? - Yes, sir.

46
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,730
这次我要你仔细找到那些文件 这是首要的
We don't have much time to find that file. This is top priority.

47
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,732
- 我知道 先生 - 这次不是仅仅校正我的银行报表…
- I know, sir. - This isn't correcting my bank statement...

48
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:13,734
或电话账单… 这次是完全控制
or phone bill problem... this is a must.

49
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,736
- 我明白 - 我写了你
- I understand. - Now, I wrote you.

50
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:17,738
- 是的 先生 - 我告诉了你关于系统所有的一切
- Yes, sir. - I taught you everything about the system.

51
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,532
- 谢谢 但是… - 没有但是 那是为了用户
- Thank you, but... - No buts. That's for Users.

52
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:22,576
你是最好的程序
You're the best program that's ever been written.

53
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,786
- 你是顽固无情的 记得吗？ - 让我瞄准他们
- You're dogged and relentless, remember? - Let me at them.

54
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,247
那是精神 让坦克动起来
That's the spirit. Keep that tank rolling.

55
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,750
我会在这里掩护你 快走
I will try to cover you from this end. Go.

56
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,438
你认为我们可以融入这些数据流吗？
You think we can merge with this memory, Bit?

57
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:53,482
是的
Yes.

58
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:03,659
弗林说检查这边
Now Flynn is saying to look over in here,

59
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,869
我没有看见我们所要看的
but I don't see what we're looking for.

60
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,296
快点 那些鬼数据就在那里
Come on, you scuzzy data, be in there. Come on.

61
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:26,973
我们有伙伴了
We have got company.

62
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:33,814
我不能相信这个
I don't believe this.

63
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:37,359
- 一个识别器 - 是 是 是 是 是
- A Recognizer. - Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes.

64
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,580
他们太多了！
There's too many.

65
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,396
这是什么？
What is this?

66
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:32,372
见鬼！
Damn it.

67
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:41,465
- 快离开 - 是 是 是
- Get out of here. - Yes-yes-yes.

68
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:40,856
是 是 是
Yes-yes-yes.

69
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,729
又失败了！
Busted again.

70
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,900
那是我最好的程序
God, and that was my best program.

71
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,413
抓到了一个非法程序 自称他的名字叫克鲁
Got a pirate program here. Says his name's Clu.

72
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,415
他想要什么？
What did he pull?

73
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:18,418
他通过一个被盗密码进入系统
He came into the system with a stolen password.

74
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,421
我们发现他试图进入高级内存
We caught him trying to raid our high-clearance memory.

75
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:24,841
不！ 我一定是不小心到那里的
No. I must have gotten in there by mistake.

76
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:27,844
- 谁编写了你？ - 我只是简单…
- Who programmed you? - I was simp...

77
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:38,021
你有麻烦了 程序
You're in trouble, program.

78
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:41,232
让自己舒服点吧 谁是你的用户？
Make it easy on yourself. Who's your User?

79
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:44,486
忘了他吧 强大的主控制先生
Forget it, Mr. High And Mighty Master Control.

80
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,865
你无法让我说的
You aren't making me talk.

81
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:53,244
当心自己
Suit yourself.

82
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,593
替我找迪林杰
Get me Dillinger.

83
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:02,397
晚上好 迪林杰先生
Good evening, Mr. Dillinger.

84
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,399
谢谢 皮特 你可以走了
Thank you, Peter. You can go now.

85
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,443
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

86
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:26,125
要求接通主控制程序 用户代码00-迪林杰 密码：MASTER


87
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:30,507
你好 迪林杰先生 谢谢尽早回来


88
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,969
没问题 主控制
No problem, Master C.

89
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:36,222
如果你看了一个电子展览 你就等于看了全部
If you have seen one consumer electronics show, you have seen them all.

90
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,224
怎么啦？
What's up?

91
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,852
那是你的朋友-身体检查 又在折腾了


92
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:42,896
- 弗林？ - 是的
- Flynn? - Yes.

93
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,775
他仍然在找那些老文件 你没办法处理吗？
He's still looking for that old file. Can't you just appropriate it?

94
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,696
我有 我把它放到他还不知道的内存中
I have. I put it in my memory, which he hasn't located.

95
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:55,366
- 他有可能找到它 - 恐怕是的
- But he might find it. - I am afraid so.

96
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,994
这次我阻止了他并把他踢了出去 但他变得越来越狡猾
I spotted him this time and kept him out,

97
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:01,289
它变得越来越麻烦了
but he's getting trickier all the time.

98
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,750
我们应该关闭所有入口…
I think we should shut down all access...

99
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,127
直到我们找到那个弗林 仅为安全起见
until we find that Flynn, just to be safe.

100
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:11,299
- 你有68.71%的机会是正确的 - 聪明
- There's a 68.71% chance you're right. - Cute.

101
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:12,514
结束


102
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:21,516
要求的文件为空… 创程序不可用


103
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:34,518
要求：主控制释放程序创 JA 307020…
我有优先接入权力7


104
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,958
- 你的接入被暂停 请立即找迪林杰先生 - 见鬼！


105
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,128
艾伦 我能吃些你的爆米花吗？
Hey, Alan. You think I could have some of your popcorn?

106
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,422
是的 当然
Yeah, sure.

107
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:24,163
- 坐下 - 谢谢
- Sit down. - Thank you.

108
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,920
我们不得不关闭所有第7级用户组
We have had to shut down all Group-7 personnel.

109
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,381
暂时的 为了安全
Just briefly. Security.

110
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,717
有人暂时得到了我们的接入
Someone with that access has been tampering.

111
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:38,344
你不会认为是我吧！
I hope you don't think it's me.

112
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,430
停机期间我甚至无法平衡我的支票簿
I don't even balance my chequebook on downtime.

113
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,516
- 我的家庭需要它 - 你一定可以理解
- I have an abacus at home for that. - I am sure you understand.

114
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:46,853
只是几天而已 你正在做的项目是什么？
It will only be a couple of days. What's the project you're working on?

115
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:51,357
它叫创 实际上它是个安全程序
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually.

116
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:55,445
它监视我们的系统和别人的联系
It monitors all contacts between our system and other systems.

117
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:58,364
任何没有预定的 它就关闭它
Finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down.

118
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:01,159
我给你发过备忘
I sent you a memo on it.

119
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,327
主控制程序的一部分？
Part of the Master Control Program?

120
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:08,541
不是 它是独立运行的 同时也监视主控制程序
No, it will run independently and watchdog the MCP as well.

121
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,919
听上去不错
Sounds good.

122
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,339
我们应该可以在几天内让你恢复工作 但愿吧
We should have you running in a couple of days. I hope.

123
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:18,925
好吧
Okay.

124
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,555
谢谢
Thanks.

125
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,820
孩子
Oh, boy.

126
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,948
迪林杰先生 我对你非常失望
Mr. Dillinger, I am so very disappointed in you.

127
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,950
对不起
I am sorry.

128
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,996
我不能负担一个独立的程序监视我
I can't afford to have an independent programmer monitoring me.

129
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:50,208
你知道我要进入多少外部系统？
Do you realize how many outside systems I have gone into?

130
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,502
多少程序我要处理？
How many programs I have appropriated?

131
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,505
快点！
Come on.

132
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:59,008
几天！
A couple of days.

133
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,278
你好 吉布斯博士
Hi, Dr. Gibbs.

134
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:36,131
系统纪录 1039 主传送序列限制你的


135
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,978
这里什么都没有
Well, here goes nothing.

136
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:55,731
是的 有趣有趣 你知道你刚才说了什么？
Yeah, interesting. You hear what you just said?

137
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:58,192
- “这里什么都没有” - 我是说…
- "Here goes nothing." - Well, what I meant was...

138
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:02,571
实际上 我们计划要将一些东西变走 然后再变回来
Actually, what we propose to do is to change something into nothing and back again.

139
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:06,659
你应该说“这里有些东西 这里变成没有东西”
You might just as well have said, "Here goes something, here comes nothing."

140
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:11,122
- Right. - All right. Let's clear the area.

141
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,377
这是关键时刻
This is the big moment.

142
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:19,422
那将限制你的理论 U-V扫描电波…
I know. This will narrow your theory that the scanned U-V beam...

143
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:21,924
应该是单脉冲传播
is superior to single pulse exposure.

144
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:25,678
30秒内进行激光操作
Laser activity will exist in 30 seconds.

145
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:28,556
戴上护目镜 离开这个隔间到安全区
Put on your goggles. Leave the bay.

146
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:31,017
让我们看看我们是否得到了绿光
Let's see if we have got the green light.

147
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:34,145
- 目标区域隔离了？ - 他们确认安全
- Is the target area shielded? - They verified safety.

148
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:36,731
20 秒
Twenty seconds.

149
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:39,525
- 看上去不错 - 让她干吧
- Looks good. - Let her rip.

150
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,569
这正是我们在等待的
This is what we have been waiting for.

151
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,573
10 秒
Ten seconds.

152
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:52,580
5 秒
Five seconds.

153
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:08,221
完美！
Perfect.

154
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,434
- 棒极了 - 你好 艾伦
- Beautiful. - Hi, Alan.

155
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,395
分解物体很有趣？
You two having fun disintegrating things?

156
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,731
不是分解 是数字化
Not disintegrating, digitizing.

157
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:22,526
一束激光拆除分子结构
A laser dismantles the molecular structure of the object,

158
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:25,988
分子暂时保存在激光束中
and molecules remain suspended in the laser beam.

159
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,574
当电脑计算出模型
Then, when the computer plays out the model,

160
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:32,077
分子回到原位 瞧？
the molecules fall back into place, and voil?

161
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,413
很棒 它能把我送到夏威夷吗？
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?

162
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:39,335
你必须提前30天购买你的程序
Yeah, but you have got to purchase your program 30 days in advance.

163
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,462
楼上怎么样？
How's it going upstairs?

164
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:45,257
令人灰心 我的创就快成功了…
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready...

165
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:48,594
就当迪林杰关闭所有第7级接入时
when Dillinger cut everyone with Group-7 access out of the system.

166
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:52,807
从他有了那个主控制程序后
Ever since he got that Master Control Program,

167
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:55,392
系统里的虫子比诱饵商店还多
the system's got more bugs than a bait store.

168
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:57,394
你犯了些错误
You got to expect some static.

169
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,272
计算机只是机器 它们不会思考
After all, computers are just machines. They can't think.

170
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,274
一些程序很快就要会思考了
Some programs will be thinking soon.

171
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:04,610
不觉得很宏大吗？
Won't that be grand?

172
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,447
计算机如果会思考 人类就不会思考了
Computers and programs will start thinking, and the people will stop.

173
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,116
我要留下来 去输入些数据 明天见
I am going to stay around, put some data through. See you tomorrow.

174
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:12,116
再见
Bye.

175
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,621
来吧
Come on.

176
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,832
- 你是说第7级接入组吗？ - 是的
- Did you say Group-7 access? - Yeah.

177
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:22,127
真是混蛋 我都准备好了
What a hassle. I was all set.

178
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,339
- 他有说为什么吗？ - 关于什么篡改的事情
- Did he say why? - Something about tampering.

179
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,300
篡改？
Tampering?

180
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,179
自从迪林杰解雇了他 弗林一直试图闯入系统
Flynn has been thinking about breaking into the system ever since Dillinger canned him.

181
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:34,390
而且他有第7级接入权限
And he had Group-7 access.

182
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,393
弗林也有进入你的权限
Flynn had access to you too.

183
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,565
我想去弗林那里
I want to go to Flynn's place.

184
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,567
- 干吗？ - 警告他
- What for? - To warn him.

185
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:48,988
- 警告什么？ - 迪林杰在注意他
- Of what? - That Dillinger's onto him.

186
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:52,491
我不知道我为什么要帮助他！
I don't see why I have to do that guy any favors.

187
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,994
我不知道你到底看上他哪点
I don't know what you ever saw in that guy, anyway.

188
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,664
我爱他的头脑
I loved him for his brains.

189
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:02,126
别把零钱放入计价器 我们需要它们打游戏
Don't put any change in the meter. We're going to need it for the games.

190
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,842
孩子 我好久没来这里了
Boy. I haven't been here in a long time.

191
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,353
伙计 这里
Hey, Bobby, up here.

192
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,211
- 他在哪里？ - 我不知道
- Where is he? - I don't know.

193
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:48,547
迷失在他的某个游戏中
Somewhere in here, lost in one of his games.

194
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:56,388
你知道弗林在哪里吗？
Excuse me. Do you know where Flynn is?

195
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:58,390
知道 就在他的机器边
Yeah, he's over there on his machine.

196
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:08,859
他正在操纵 又一个纪录
He's really on a roll. One more Reco before he ties.

197
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,988
又一个纪录 他破了世界纪录
Another Reco and he gets the world's record.

198
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:26,502
他要破纪录了 所有的纪录
He's going for the record. The all-time record coming up.

199
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,634
就是它了 结束了
This is it. It's all over.

200
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,806
弗林这把他自己变成历史的一部分！
Flynn's going to be a part of history, all right.

201
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,521
弗林 你怎么做到的？
Hey, Flynn, how'd you do it?

202
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,607
全靠手腕
It's all in the wrists.

203
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:51,360
999,000点！
999,000 points.

204
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:56,490
见到你们真高兴
Hey, good to see you guys.

205
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,576
Nothing classes up the joint like a clean-cut young couple.

206
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,620
我们得谈谈
We got to talk.

207
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,747
在这里听不见你自己 来吧
You can't hear yourself think in here. Come on.

208
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,544
- 来吧 - 我离开一会儿
- Come on. - I will be down in a minute.

209
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,464
严肃科学的世界怎么样了？
How's the world of serious science?

210
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,466
就象在家里一样
Go up ahead. Make yourselves at home.

211
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,635
一直等着
Be right up.

212
00:19:19,513 --> 00:19:23,392
英康曾见过的最好的程序员
The best programmer ENCOM ever saw,

213
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:27,813
而他正在屋子里玩太空牛仔
and he winds up playing space cowboy in some back room.

214
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,815
让我来说
Okay, let me handle this.

215
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,900
说吧
Go right ahead.

216
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,362
你有没有偷入英康系统？
Have you been sneaking into the ENCOM system?

217
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:40,075
你从没有很多闲聊
You never were much for small talk, were you?

218
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,080
她是否还是把她的衣服扔得到处都是？没有
She still leave her clothes all over the floor? No.

219
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,166
- 艾伦 - 我的意思是没那么经常
- Alan. - I mean, not that often.

220
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,419
你现在明白为什么他的朋友都只有14岁了
You can see why all his friends are 14 years old.

221
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,259
接触？
Touch?

222
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:04,683
实际上我有做过一些黑客
I have been doing a little hacking, as a matter of fact.

223
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:07,436
- 你确实闯入 - 尝试
- You did break in. - Tried to.

224
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:11,064
我看上去不能很好的连接
I can't seem to quite get the connection with that sucker, though.

225
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,191
如果我有一个直接的终端…
If I had a direct terminal...

226
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,193
弗林 你有没有侵吞？
Flynn, are you embezzling?

227
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,866
侵吞是一个丑陋的词 布拉德利先生
Embezzling is such an ugly word, Mr. Bradley.

228
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,952
实际上 我正在尝试找些证据
No, actually, I am trying to get some solid evidence together.

229
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:28,206
- 我不明白 - 好吧
- I don't get it. - Okay.

230
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:33,086
让我们回到三年前
Sherman, set the Way-Back Machine for three years ago.

231
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:35,380
凯文・弗林
Kevin Flynn,

232
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,760
英康最聪明的年轻软件工程师
one of ENCOM's brightest young software engineers.

233
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,387
他是如此聪明 在晚上他开始工作
He's so bright, he starts going in at night,

234
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:44,389
建立他自己的私人记忆文档…
sets up his own private memory file...

235
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:48,727
并开始写一个电视游戏 叫做…
and begins writing a program for video games, invented called...

236
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,896
“太空妄想者”
Space Paranoids.

237
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,398
你写了“太空妄想者”？
You invented Space Paranoids?

238
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:57,069
“妄想者” “矩阵爆破工” “警察缉捕队” 一系列的
Paranoids, Matrix Blaster, Vice Squad... a whole slew of them.

239
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,654
我离自己的事业就差这一小步
I was this close to starting my own little enterprise.

240
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:03,575
但是进来了另一个软件工程师
But enter another software engineer;

241
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,745
不是那么年轻聪明的 但是非常非常卑鄙;
not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky;

242
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,372
Ed・迪林杰
Ed Dillinger.

243
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:10,470
一个夜晚 我们的男孩弗林
One night, our boy Flynn,

244
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,568
进入他的终端
he goes to his terminal,

245
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:12,667
试图读取他的文件
tries to read up his file.

246
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:16,004
我什么也没读到 那儿一片空白
I get nothing on there. There's a big blank.

247
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,090
好吧 现在我们带你到3个月后
All right, now we take you three months later,

248
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,968
迪林杰发布了英康的5个电视游戏…
Dillinger presents ENCOM with five video games...

249
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,970
都是他开发的
that he's invented.

250
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,306
这人渣甚至没有改名字
The slime didn't even change the names, man.

251
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:28,308
他得到了大提升
He gets a big, fat promotion.

252
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:31,144
然后开始了他流星般的升迁至…他现在是什么？
Thus begins his meteoric rise to... what is he now?

253
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:34,439
- 执行副总裁？ - 高级执行官？
- Executive V.P? - Senior exec?

254
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:36,691
高级执行官？
Senior exec?

255
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:42,134
期间 孩子们一个星期投了8百万2角5分
Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million 

256
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,783
辅币到幻想者机器中
quarters a week into Paranoid machines.

257
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,786
我没有看见一角钱 除了从这儿榨到的
I don't see a dime, except what I squeeze out of here.

258
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:51,957
我仍然不理解你为什么要闯入系统
I still don't understand why you want to break into the system.

259
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:56,837
内存中的某个地方有证据
Because, man, somewhere in one of these memories is the evidence.

260
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:59,965
如果我能进入的足够远 我可以重组它
If I got in far enough I could reconstruct it.

261
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:02,968
我的密码 迪林杰的转移指令…
My password, Dillinger's instructions to divert the data...

262
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:07,138
太晚了 迪林杰已经关闭了第7级组接入权限
It's too late for that. Dillinger's cut off everybody with Group-7 access.

263
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,641
等等 你说什么？
Wait. Wait. What are you saying?

264
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,811
这家伙知道你要什么
The guy knows what you're up to.

265
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:15,897
太棒了 你在跟我开玩笑？
Great. You're kidding me?

266
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:22,445
现在什么都不能阻止他
Well, now there is nothing to stop him.

267
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:26,825
现在只有迪林杰和主控制程序运行一切
It's just Dillinger and the MCP running things from on high now.

268
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:30,912
如果我的创程序在运行就不会了 那会关了系统
Not if my Tron program was running. That'd shut the system down.

269
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,210
如果你的文件在那里…
You know, if your file was in there...

270
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,296
等等 如果我们可以到那里
Wait a minute. If we can get in there,

271
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:41,673
我可以伪造一个第6级接入
I can forge us a Group-6 access.

272
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,928
好吧？我们应该跳舞了吗？
Well? Shall we dance?

273
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:58,857
我有很好的理由关闭第7级接入
I shut down Group-7 for a very good reason.

274
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:03,028
如果我们的人不能接入他们的程序…
Ed, all I am saying is if our people can't get access to their programs...

275
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:06,197
你知道这令他们多灰心吗？
Well, you know how frustrating it is when you're working on a piece of research.

276
00:23:06,197 --> 00:23:09,868
我很同情 但主控制程序告诉我
I sympathize, but I have data coming from the Master Control Program...

277
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,245
那里有些不对劲
telling me there's something screwy going on.

278
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,914
那个主控制程序是所有问题的一半！
That MCP, that's half our problem right there.

279
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:18,084
主控制程序是最有效管理我们工作的方式！
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do.

280
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:21,296
我不能坐在这里照顾每个用户的请求
I can't sit here and worry about every little User request that comes in.

281
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:23,590
用户请求是电脑在这里的目的
User requests are what computers are for.

282
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,343
做我们的生意是电脑在这里的目的！
Doing our business is what computers are for.

283
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:47,614
英康不再是你的车库中发起的生意了
ENCOM isn't the business you started in your garage any more.

284
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:51,242
我们在30个国家有机构
We're building accounts in 30 different countries, new defense systems.

285
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:54,329
新的防御系统中最长久的部分
We have one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in existence.

286
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,373
这些我都知道
Oh, I know all that.

287
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,419
有时我希望回到自己的车库
Sometimes I wish I were back in that garage.

288
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,755
那可以安排 沃尔特
That can be arranged, Walter.

289
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:07,300
那是没有理由的
That was uncalled for.

290
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,429
你可以开除艾伦和我 但我们协助创造了它
You can remove men like Alan and me from the system, but we helped create it.

291
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:15,767
我们的精神会留在每一个我们设计的程序中
And our spirit remains in every program we designed for this computer.

292
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,103
沃尔特 很晚了 我有更好的事情要做…
Walter, it's getting late. I have got better things to do...

293
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:20,313
不跟你做无谓的讨论
than to have religious discussions with you.

294
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:24,943
不必再担心英康 现在超出你的掌握了
Don't worry about ENCOM any more. It's out of your hands now.

295
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,620
我不认为我有授权
I don't think I am cleared for this.

296
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,747
- 我当然也没有 - 能站开些吗？
- I am certainly not. - You want to move aside?

297
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:40,083
给我点小小空间
Give the kid a little room.

298
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,630
这家伙有点象圣诞老人
This guy's a little like Santa Claus.

299
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,217
我自己做的 你要一个吗？
I make these myself. You want one?

300
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:03,481
他们不应该开除我
They never should have gotten rid of me.

301
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:09,863
- 现在他是一扇大门了 - 闭嘴
- Now that is a big door. - Shut up.

302
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,666
那是我的错 我设计你想要得太多了
It's my fault. I programmed you to want too much.

303
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,168
我正准备攻击五角大楼
I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week.

304
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:26,337
五角大楼？
The Pentagon?

305
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:29,340
那应该不会比任何大公司难
It shouldn't be harder than any other big company.

306
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,343
这是我从人类这里学到的
But now this is what I get for using humans.

307
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,596
等一下 我写了你
Wait a minute. I wrote you.

308
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:38,933
我比那时聪明了2.45百万倍
I have gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.

309
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,311
你想从五角大楼得到什么？
What do you want with the Pentagon?

310
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:45,356
和我想从克林姆林宫得到的一样 我对公司很反感
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I am bored with corporations.

311
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:48,359
有了这些信息 我可以进入
With the information I can access,

312
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,822
我可以比任何人运行的好900到1200倍
I can run things 900 to 1,200 times better than any human.

313
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:55,283
如果你认为你超越了我们…
If you think you're superior to us...

314
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,285
你不希望我挖出弗林的文件…
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file...

315
00:25:57,285 --> 00:26:00,121
并公布在泰晤士报可视终端上吧？
and read it up on a V.D.T. at the Times, would you?

316
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,624
你不敢！
You wouldn't dare.

317
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,969
- 嘿 - 嘿 加班了？
- Hi. - Hi. Working late?

318
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:17,138
是的
Yeah.

319
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:24,020
好的 过来
Okay, come here.

320
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,022
我让他用我的终端…
I am going to put him at my terminal.

321
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,066
然后到楼上你的办公室找你
I am going to meet you in your office upstairs.

322
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:31,736
别睡着了 如果我能启动创
Don't fall asleep. If and when I activate your Tron program,

323
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:36,115
在迪林杰找到缺口前 你只有几分钟时间
you will only have a few minutes to use it before Dillinger catches the break in security.

324
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:38,368
只要我们不到顶楼
As long as we stay off the top floor,

325
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,787
迪林杰就不知道我们在这里
Dillinger will never know we have been in here.

326
00:26:40,787 --> 00:26:42,830
祝好运 hot shot
Good luck, hotshot.

327
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:07,605
- 嗯哼 - 弗林
- Ahem. - Flynn.

328
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,649
跟着你
After you.

329
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:34,799
把那些有问题的程序清除出系统
Keep those programmers out of the system,

330
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,969
把那些我要的汉语文件给我
and get me that Chinese language file I asked for.

331
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:40,221
终点位置
End of line.

332
00:27:57,446 --> 00:28:00,324
- 你要支持我？ - 为什么？
- You are going to stick with me? - What for?

333
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,618
你是唯一不需要帮助的 记得吗？
You're the one who never needed help, remember?

334
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:06,122
我怕黑 所有这些科技也令我害怕了
Come on. I am scared of the dark. All this technology scares me.

335
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,405
这边！
This way.

336
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:48,623
- 他们什么时候安装了这个？ - 这是我工作的地方
- When did they put this in? - This is where I work.

337
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:51,042
我在激光目标区有一个直接终端
I have got a direct terminal in the laser target area.

338
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,294
你可以整晚呆在那里
You can stay there all night if you have to.

339
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:03,471
就象一个男人说的“这里没有问题 只有解决”
Like a man says, "There's no problems, only solutions."

340
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:06,641
记住 这激光是我的生命
Okay, remember, this laser is my life's work.

341
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:10,019
不要摔坏任何东西 Huh？
Don't spill anything. Huh?

342
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:12,271
开心点 甜心
Have fun, sweetheart.

343
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:26,173
要求：接入级别6
密码 SERIES PS 17
驯鹿小分队


344
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:30,174
弗林你不应该回来


345
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:33,709
这是所有人都在讨论的主控制程序
Hey, it's the big Master Control Program everybody's been talking about.

346
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:36,420
坐在那里 让自己舒服些
Sit right there. Make yourself comfortable.

347
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,799
还记得我们一起玩象棋的时光吗？
Remember the time we used to spend playing chess together?

348
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:45,177
那对你没有任何好处 弗林 恐怕你…


349
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,308
停下！
Stop. Please.

350
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:51,310
你知道我不能允许这样
You realize I can't allow this?

351
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,107
如果你无法回答不能解决的问题…你怎么能够统治世界？
How are you going to run the universe if you can't answer a few unsolvable problems?

352
00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:58,484
让我们看看你都有些什么
Come on, big fella, let's see what you have got.

353
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:01,195
我想看看你是由什么做的
I'd like to go against you and see what you're made of.

354
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,447
难道在你眼里物体不都象图片一样吗？
You don't look a thing like your pictures.

355
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:07,284
我在警告你 你正在犯一个大错误
I am warning you, you're entering a big error, Flynn.

356
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:09,370
我要把你放到游戏中
I am going to have to put you on the game grid.

357
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,831
游戏？你想玩游戏？我来给你游戏玩
Games? You want games? I will give you games.

358
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:52,431
这不会发生 这只是幻想
Oh, man, this isn't happening. It only thinks it's happening.

359
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:57,478
空出入口 程序
Vacate entry port, program.

360
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,901
我说 移动！
I said, move.

361
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:10,532
看 如果是关于停车票的事
Look, if this is about those parking tickets,

362
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:12,618
我可以解释一切
I can explain everything, okay?

363
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:20,668
准备好所有关于战争游戏的程序
Prepare all programs for war games.

364
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:26,799
我已经为你找到了一个挑战者 萨克 一个新电路
I have got a little challenge for you, Sark; a new recruit.

365
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,969
这是个难题 想平时一样对付他
It's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner.

366
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:31,971
为了这个游戏训练他
Train him for the games,

367
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:35,015
让他期望 然后击败他
let him hope for a while, then blow him away.

368
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:37,017
明白
You got it.

369
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:40,396
希望你送来一些勇敢的人
I have been hoping you'd send me somebody with a little bit of guts.

370
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:42,481
他是什么样的程序？
What kind of program is he?

371
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:46,151
他不是程序 他是用户
He's not any kind of program, Sark, he's a User.

372
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:48,320
- 一个用户？ - 是的
- A User? - That's right.

373
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,031
他在现实世界攻击我
He pushed me in the real world.

374
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:54,994
有人攻击我我就回击 所以我把他带到这里来
Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here.

375
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:59,665
怎么啦？你看上去很不安
What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.

376
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:02,960
好的 我只是…
Well, I... I was just...

377
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:07,965
我不知道 一个用户 我的意思是…
I don't know. A User, I mean...

378
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:11,051
用户写了我们
Users wrote us.

379
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,053
用户甚至写了你！
A User even wrote you.

380
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:17,558
没有用户写我 我值上百万人类年
No one User wrote me. I am worth millions of their man-years.

381
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:19,560
如果…？
What if I can't?

382
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,146
你最好和我一起碰碰运气？
You'd rather take your chances with me?

383
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:24,982
希望我降低你的能量周期？
Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?

384
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:26,984
我需要那个！
Wait. I need that.

385
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:30,821
那就齐心协力训练这个小丑
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained.

386
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:35,451
我要他在这个游戏中玩到死为止 明白
I want him in the games until he dies playing. Acknowledge.

387
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:39,079
明白 主控制
Acknowledged, Master Control.

388
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,415
结束
End of line.

389
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,881
游戏单元18 这里 程序
Video game unit 18. In here, program.

390
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:51,925
你叫谁“程序”程序？
Who you calling program, program?

391
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:58,182
新家伙？
New guy?

392
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:00,601
有一个离线的自由程序
Another free program off-line.

393
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:03,187
你认为用户们还在那里吗？
You really think the Users are still there?

394
00:34:03,187 --> 00:34:05,981
他们最好是
They'd better be.

395
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:10,194
我不想逃出这里后…除了冰冷的电路什么都找不到
I don't want to bust out of here and find nothing but a lot of cold circuits waiting for me.

396
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:16,283
- 你们是谁？ - 停下
- Who are you guys? - Hold it.

397
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:18,285
当心那些力场
You want to watch those force fields.

398
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:21,580
如果不注意的话你极有可能受伤 不用担心那些
You will be having plenty of chances to get hurt. Don't worry about that.

399
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:26,627
我只是想告诉我的朋友…
Look, just so I can tell my friends...

400
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:30,047
这是个什么梦
what this dream is about, okay, where am I?

401
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:33,800
我是谁？
You're a......

402
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:40,807
你是主控制程序的客人
guest of the Master Control Program.

403
00:34:40,807 --> 00:34:42,768
太棒了
Oh, great.

404
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:45,479
- 他让你玩电视游戏 - 不费力的
- They're going to make you play video games. - No sweat.

405
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:48,815
我比任何人都善于玩电视游戏
I play video games better than anybody.

406
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,991
出来！这边
Move out. This way.

407
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,997
你 你来这边
You, you come this way.

408
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:06,667
这是一个错误 我要见主管
There's been a mistake. I have got to see the guy in charge.

409
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:07,751
你会的
You will.

410
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:34,611
指挥程序萨克的军舰正在接近
Command Program Sark's carrier is approaching.

411
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:37,197
他会解释训练程序
He will explain the training procedures.

412
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:44,705
大家好
Greetings.

413
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:50,377
主控制程序选择了你们…
The Master Control Program has chosen you...

414
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:53,964
来服务你们系统的游戏单元
to serve your system on the game grid.

415
00:35:53,964 --> 00:35:58,301
你们中间那些继续对用户表示忠诚的…
Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the Users...

416
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:02,347
将会接受标准的不合格处罚
will receive the standard substandard training,

417
00:36:02,347 --> 00:36:06,226
这将导致最终的毁灭
which will result in your eventual elimination.

418
00:36:06,226 --> 00:36:10,313
你们中间那些断绝…
Those of you who renounce...

419
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:14,484
这种迷信和歇斯底里的信仰的
this superstitious and hysterical belief,

420
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:21,491
将会成为主控制程序的战斗精英
will be eligible to join the warrior elite...of the MCP.

421
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:25,203
你们每一位都会受到一张身份碟
You will each receive an identity disk.

422
00:36:25,203 --> 00:36:28,498
你们所需做的或学的…
Everything you do or learn...

423
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,376
都打印在这张碟上
will be imprinted on this disk.

424
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:35,756
如果你们丢失了或不能完成指令
If you lose your disk or fail to follow commands,

425
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:40,761
你们将会立即被分解
you will be subject to immediate de-resolution.

426
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:42,763
这就是全部
That will be all.

427
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,810
开始行动
Move out.

428
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:03,867
那个家伙是谁？
Hey, who's that guy?

429
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,036
创 他为用户作战
That's Tron. He fights for the Users.

430
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:08,038
创？
Tron?

431
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:47,369
- 他很棒 - 瞧这个
- That's pretty good. - Watch this.

432
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,412
如果你想活下去 你最好棒一点

433
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:52,415
- 你叫什么？ - 我的名字叫拉姆
- What's your name? - My name's Ram.

434
00:37:56,586 --> 00:37:58,588
拉姆
Hey, Ram,

435
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:00,632
你以前是干什么的？
what were you, you know, before?

436
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:03,426
我是一个保险精算程序
I was an actuarial program.

437
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:05,929
我为一家大保险公司工作

438

给你些实在的感觉…

439
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:11,768
帮助规划将来的需要
helping folks plan for their future needs.

440
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:14,688
如果你把这笔直出当作养老金
Of course, if you think of the payments as an annuity over the years,

441
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,773
开销是很小的
the cost is really quite minimal.

442
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,900
是的 那很好
Yeah, that's great.

443
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,945
保险精算程序 好极了
Actuarial program. Nice.

444
00:38:21,945 --> 00:38:24,030
你自己呢？
How about yourself?

445
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,950
我不记得太多了
Oh, I don't remember too much.

446
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,952
我叫弗林
Name's Flynn.

447
00:38:28,952 --> 00:38:32,455
当然 迷惑 在转变中是很正常的
Sure, a little disorientation, that's normal in transport.

448
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:34,791
你会记起来的
It will come back to you.

449
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,546
就这样了 好运 弗林
This is it. Good luck, Flynn.

450
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:45,260
长官 新兵正从…
Sir, conscript being moved from pit cell to ring game.

451
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,430
牢房移送到竞技场
You know... Hey.

452
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,473
你们这些家伙应该客气点
You guys sure are friendly.

453
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:52,475
等一下
Wait.

454
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:57,355
让他和自己人作战
Let him fight one of his own kind.

455
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:37,228
你认为你能除去我？
You think you're going to wipe me out, don't you?

456
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:39,522
不 我…
No, I...

457
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:45,361
嘿 我…
Hey. I...

458
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,786
那新来的问了你
The new guy was asking about you.

459
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,122
太糟了 他正在比赛中
It's too bad he's in a match now.

460
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,124
我可能再也见不到他了
I will probably never meet him.

461
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:02,378
也许 他有些与众不同
You might. There's something different about him.

462
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:16,058
好吧
Okay.

463
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,502
那是很不错的一击
That was a very fancy shot.

464
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:47,507
好吧 来个简单点的
Okay, here's an easy one.

465
00:41:03,648 --> 00:41:05,775
完成游戏！
Finish the game.

466
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:08,444
- 不！ - 杀了他
- No. - Kill him.

467
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,030
不
No.

468
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:15,535
你会为此而后悔的
You will regret this.

469
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:38,224
我希望他留在游戏中直到厌恶游戏为止
I want him in the games until he dies playing.

470
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:54,490
这是轻型赛车的出发点
This is the holding area for the lightcycles.

471
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,161
- 弗林 你做到了 - 等在这
- Hey, Flynn, you made it. - Wait here.

472
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:01,497
- 你赢了 - 艾伦
- You won. - Alan.

473
00:42:01,497 --> 00:42:03,374
你从哪里听到那个名字的？
Where did you hear that name?

474
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:06,753
- 那是你的名字 不是吗？ - 我的用户的名字
- That's your name, isn't it? - The name of my User.

475
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:11,883
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

476
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:14,469
我是一个认识艾伦的用户的程序
I am a program from a User that knows Alan.

477
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,929
他因为转换而迷糊了 创
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.

478
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:19,265
我都记起来了
But I am remembering all kinds of stuff,

479
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:23,144
就象我的用户要求我追逐主控制程序
like my User wants me to go after the MCP.

480
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:25,188
我的用户也想那样
My User wants that too.

481
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:27,190

把这些家伙包入你们的喷气墙中

486
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:05,103
- 明白 蓝色领袖 - 明白 蓝色领袖

489
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:43,015
当心！
Watch it. 

490
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:03,953
把他带入迷宫
Taking him into the maze.

491
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:17,508
就是它了 来吧
This is it. Come on.

明白
Got it.

494
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:37,069
- 准备好了？ - 好了
- Ready? - Ready.

495
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,363
就这样 傻瓜
So long, sucker.

496
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:58,215
恭喜 程序们！

497
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:04,388
武士正从游戏单元逃跑 这是非法出口
Video game warriors escaping game grid. This is an illegal exit.

498
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:08,517

派出所有的游戏坦克到那个单元

抓住他们！
Get them.

504
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,629
我不应该写那些坦克程序

505
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,269
目标离看保护区域

追击部队失去一辆坦克 队伍靠紧

510
00:47:08,137 --> 00:47:10,180

511
00:47:13,475 --> 00:47:15,436
在屏幕的另一面
On the other side of the screen,

512
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:17,479
所有的东西看上去都那么简单
it all looked so easy.

513
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:25,571
他们一定已经越过我们了
They must have gone right past us.

514
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:29,491
我们做到了…
We made it...

515
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:33,037

追击部队报告

Get the pursuit forces back into the canyons. Those programs never made it out.

我们必须在他们到达中断信号界面前截住他们
We will have them back in no time, sir, long before the interrupt interface.

520
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:50,929
我们最好这样 无用的家伙
We'd better, null unit.

521
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:55,351
我会感到非常幸运 如果主控制程序不杀了我
I will be lucky if the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.

522
00:47:55,351 --> 00:47:57,269
我要抓住他们！
I want those conscripts.

523
00:48:05,944 --> 00:48:08,864
那是什么？你看见了什么？
What is it? What do you see?

524
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:10,908

Look at that.

527
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:24,755
我们什么时候可以拜访主控制程序？
When do we pay our visit to the old Master Control?

528
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:26,799
什么？
What?

529
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:31,220
我们只有三个人
There's just three of us.

530
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,056
如果你认识什么雇佣军 很好
Well, if you know anybody who's got an army for rent, that's fine,

531
00:48:34,056 --> 00:48:37,559
但我的用户要我揪出那个家伙
but my User told me to go take that sucker out,

532
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:39,561
否则我就会不去了

533
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:41,772
我们不可能找到主控制程序…
We can't get to the MCP...

534
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:43,857
除非有我的用户的帮助
without the help of my User.

535
00:48:45,984 --> 00:48:48,278
我必须到那个输入/输出塔

677
01:06:00,392 --> 01:06:03,478
你可以过去 我的朋友
You may pass, my friend.

678
01:06:12,904 --> 01:06:15,490
塔守卫者在帮他
The tower guardian is helping him.

679
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,659
他想
He thinks.

680
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:19,995
把逻辑探针拿来
Bring in the logic probe.

681
01:06:37,637 --> 01:06:40,807
加大能量！
More power.

682
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:43,078
开始了
It's begun.

683
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:47,123
创 定位询问 确定
Tron, location query. Confirm.

684
01:07:47,123 --> 01:07:49,459
确定 艾伦-1
Confirmed, Alan-1.

685
01:07:49,459 --> 01:07:51,670
我正在你的碟片里生成信息…
I am creating the information on your disk...

686
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:55,465
那将会清除主控制程序并改变系统
that will erase the MCP and change the system.

687
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:59,594
你尽力将这个碟片送入主控制程序的心脏
Dedicate yourself to getting the disk into the heart...of the MCP.

688
01:07:59,594 --> 01:08:02,138
界面在它的基地里
This interface is located at its base.

689
01:08:02,138 --> 01:08:06,309
在你成功前我们无法再联络了
We will not be able to communicate again unless you succeed.

690
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:07,059
去吧！
Go.

691
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:21,533
这是通往新秩序的钥匙
This is the key to a new order.

692
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:25,579
这个代码碟意味着自由
This code disk means freedom.

693
01:08:26,955 --> 01:08:29,833
我想他们要闯进来了
I think they're breaking in.

694
01:08:37,549 --> 01:08:40,719
- 谢谢 杜蒙特 - 快点 用户们在等着
- Thank you, Dumont. - Hurry. The Users are waiting.

695
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:57,861
杜蒙特？
Dumont?

696
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:04,075
程序在哪里？
Where's the program?

697
01:09:04,075 --> 01:09:06,244
什么程序？
What program?

698
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:09,623
抓住它！
Take him.

699
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,426
靠近点
Stay close.

700
01:09:30,935 --> 01:09:34,981
如果我能让我们到达扫描输送光束
If I can just get us on the scanning transport beam,

701
01:09:34,981 --> 01:09:38,777
模拟会通过游戏区把我们…
this solar sail simulation will take us across the game sea,

702
01:09:38,777 --> 01:09:41,029
送入中央电脑
out of this domain, back into the central computer.

703
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:51,289
当心！
Look out.

704
01:11:11,452 --> 01:11:16,207
指挥官 你已经享受到了你所赋予的力量
Commander, you have enjoyed all the power you have been given, haven't you?

705
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:20,169
我很想知道你在一个计算器里会是什么样子
I wonder how you'd take to working in a pocket calculator.

706
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:22,589
我们搞定了那个你送来的用户
We did take care of that User you sent us.

707
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:25,884
无效零 现在你有两个叛逃程序…
Incompetent zero, now you have got two renegade programs...

708
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:28,553
通过被窃的模拟在系统中到处串
flying all over the system in a stolen simulation.

709
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:32,515
我会抓住他们的 这只是时间问题
We will get them. It's only a matter of time.

710
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:35,226
你就要到最后关头了
You have almost reached your decision gate,

711
01:11:35,226 --> 01:11:37,478
我不会给你更多的时间了
and I can't spare you any more time.

712
01:11:37,478 --> 01:11:39,480
结束
End of line.

713
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:49,365
- 是我 弗林 - 弗林
- It's me... Flynn. - Flynn.

714
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:52,368
- 恭喜 程序 - 你还活着
- Greetings, program. - You're alive.

715
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:57,373
勉强 是的 我 呃…
Barely. Yeah, I, uh...

716
01:12:12,347 --> 01:12:14,265
拉姆在哪里？
Where's Ram?

717
01:12:14,265 --> 01:12:16,643
他没挺过来
He didn't make it.

718
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,528
来吧
Come on.

719
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:41,791
罗拉
Lora.

720
01:12:43,544 --> 01:12:46,631
这是弗林 救我出来的
This is Flynn. The one who busted me out.

721
01:12:46,631 --> 01:12:48,132
罗拉？
Lora?

722
01:12:48,132 --> 01:12:50,760
好的 我该谢谢他
Well, then I owe him some thanks.

723
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,848
那没什么
No, it's, uh, no big deal.

724
01:12:55,848 --> 01:12:58,976
我应该了解轻型赛车 我写了那个程序
I ought to know my way around the Lightcycle. I wrote the program.

725
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:02,146
- 你写了那个程序？ - 我该对你说实话了
- You wrote the program? - It's time I level with you.

726
01:13:02,146 --> 01:13:06,484
- 我是一个用户 - 你是一个用户？
- I am what you guys call a User. - You're a User?

727
01:13:06,484 --> 01:13:08,611
我在什么地方走错路了
I took a wrong turn somewhere.

728
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:11,280
如果你是一个用户
If you are a User,

729
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,491
你所做的每一件事都是有计划的 对吗
everything you have done has been according to a plan, right?

730
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:15,743
想的美
You wish.

731
01:13:15,743 --> 01:13:18,788
你知道那象什么
You guys know what it's like.

732
01:13:18,788 --> 01:13:22,166
你只是做你应该做的 无论那有多疯狂
You keep doing what it looks like you're supposed to, no matter how crazy it seems.

733
01:13:22,166 --> 01:13:25,002
程序就是这样的 是的
That's the way it is for programs, yes.

734
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:29,006
不愿让你失望 朋友 但多数时候用户也是这样的
Hate to disappoint you, pal, but most of the time, that's the way it is for Users too.

735
01:13:29,006 --> 01:13:31,634
奇怪 奇怪
Stranger and stranger.

736
01:13:31,634 --> 01:13:35,263
哦 你们的船很好看
So, nice-looking ship you got here.

737
01:13:54,949 --> 01:13:57,577
你想怎么处理那个塔守卫者 杜蒙特？
What do you want done with the tower guardian... Dumont?

738
01:13:57,577 --> 01:13:59,954
和其他人关在一起？
Put him with the others?

739
01:13:59,954 --> 01:14:02,707
不 笨蛋 准备提审
No, bit brain, prepare him for inquisition.

740
01:14:02,707 --> 01:14:04,709
我需要点娱乐
I need a little bit of relaxation.

741
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:06,752
首先 准备好追击战舰
First, rezz up the carrier for pursuit.

742
01:14:06,752 --> 01:14:10,006
还有 不要再思考
One other thing. Don't think any more.

743
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:12,300
这里我来思考
I do the thinking around here.

744
01:14:18,055 --> 01:14:19,974
这不容易
This isn't going to be easy.

745
01:14:19,974 --> 01:14:22,560
如果那些虫子抓到我们 我们就完了
If those grid bugs get us, we have had it.

746
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:48,085
够了吗？
Had enough?

747
01:14:48,085 --> 01:14:50,421
你要什么？我很忙
What do you want? I am busy.

748
01:14:50,421 --> 01:14:53,925
忙着死 你这个不可饶恕的老程序
Busy dying, you worn out excuse for an old program.

749
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:56,302
是的 我很老
Yes, I am old.

750
01:14:56,302 --> 01:15:00,097
老得足够能记起来主控制程序只是一个象棋程序
Old enough to remember the MCP when it was a chess program.

751
01:15:00,097 --> 01:15:02,767
他从小开始也会到小结束
He started small, and he will end small.

752
01:15:02,767 --> 01:15:06,979
很有趣 也许我应该把你留在身边娱乐
Very funny, Dumont. Maybe I should keep you around just to make me laugh.

753
01:15:17,823 --> 01:15:20,284
- 发生了什么？ - 主控制程序能量脉冲
- What's happening? - Power surge in the MCP.

754
01:15:20,284 --> 01:15:22,745
- 我们得离开这条光束 - 我不能
- We have to get off this beam. - I can't.

755
01:15:22,745 --> 01:15:24,955
在7和8纳秒没有其它的交点
There isn't another junction for seven or eight nanoseconds.

756
01:15:26,123 --> 01:15:28,417
- 那有另一条光束！ - 太远了
- There's another beam. - It's too far.

757
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:49,313
他在制造一个交点
He's creating a junction.

758
01:16:12,086 --> 01:16:14,171
我们成功了？
Did we make it?

759
01:16:14,171 --> 01:16:16,173
是的
Yeah.

760
01:16:16,173 --> 01:16:18,384
为我方欢呼
Hooray for our side.

761
01:16:42,575 --> 01:16:44,827
他分解了吗？
Is he de-rezzing?

762
01:16:44,827 --> 01:16:48,122
没有 但我不知道为什么
No, but I couldn't tell you why not.

763
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:53,919
我是一体的
I am all in one piece.

764
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:56,172
我仍和你们在一起
I guess I am still with you.

765
01:16:58,048 --> 01:17:01,802
叫那个拿手提钻的人停下
Tell the guy with the jackhammer to lay off.

766
01:17:01,802 --> 01:17:04,847
- 你怎么做到的？ - 基本定律:
- How'd you do that? - Elementary physics...

767
01:17:04,847 --> 01:17:06,849
一束能量可以被转向
a beam of energy can always be diverted.

768
01:17:06,849 --> 01:17:09,143
我们到了吗 妈咪？
Are we there yet, Mommy?

769
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:05,616
萨克！
Sark.

770
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,257
- 杜蒙特！ - 尤里
- Dumont. - Yori.

771
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:26,053
创？
Tron?

772
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:30,015
创死了
Tron's dead.

773
01:18:32,476 --> 01:18:35,396
- 那是什么？ - 那是一个用户 杜蒙特
- Who's that? - That is a User, Dumont.

774
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:38,982
他来帮我们
He came here to help us.

775
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:42,486
创信任他
Tron believed in him.

776
01:18:43,737 --> 01:18:46,990
如果用户们不再帮我们 我们就输了
If the Users can no longer help us, we're lost.

777
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:49,827
所以 我们删了那个程序…
So, we have erased that program...

778
01:18:49,827 --> 01:18:50,577
不
No.

779
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:54,665
- 你被分解了 - 不是我 萨克
- You were de-rezzed. - Not me, Sark.

780
01:18:54,665 --> 01:18:58,001
你没什么了不起的 只是一个二进制程序
There's nothing special about you. You're just an ordinary program.

781
01:18:58,001 --> 01:19:00,796
你也是 应该被删除的一分子
So are you, one that should have been erased.

782
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:03,507
你什么都不是
You're nothing.

783
01:19:03,507 --> 01:19:06,635
把那个程序送到牢房去
Take that program to the holding pit.

784
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:17,855
请！不要…
Please, don't take...

785
01:19:17,855 --> 01:19:19,857
我会把我们的朋友…
I am taking our friend here...

786
01:19:19,857 --> 01:19:22,901
和另外那些宗教狂送给主控制程序
and some other religious fanatics to Master Control.

787
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,488
当我登陆后
When I disembark,

788
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:29,575
仍留在这艘船上的一切…
this ship and everything that remains on board...

789
01:19:29,575 --> 01:19:32,202
都会被自动分解
will automatically de-rezz.

790
01:19:34,705 --> 01:19:37,541
永别了
This means you.

791
01:19:43,297 --> 01:19:45,215
继续前进！
Move on.

792
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:15,704
直接向量分离
Immediate vectors detached.

793
01:20:15,704 --> 01:20:17,706
送我们去主控制程序
Route us to the MCP.

794
01:20:17,706 --> 01:20:20,167
我想摆脱净负载
I want to get rid of this dead weight,

795
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:22,836
赶上通向游戏主域的传输光束
and catch a transport beam to the game domain.

796
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:36,141
这些墙… 尤里 有些事发生了
These walls... Yori, something's happening.

797
01:21:40,372 --> 01:21:43,458
你没事吧？
You all right?

798
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:46,044
我还有能量 萨克不知道
I still have power. Sark doesn't know that.

799
01:21:47,546 --> 01:21:49,464
让我独自呆着 我们失败了
Leave me alone. We have failed.

800
01:21:49,464 --> 01:21:53,135
只有当我们放弃时！来吧 看 这墙！
We're only going to fail if we give up. Come on, look, the wall.

801
01:21:55,262 --> 01:21:57,139
尤里
Yori.

802
01:22:05,188 --> 01:22:08,150
你把我救回来了
You brought me back.

803
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:11,445
怎么做的？为什么要把我救回来？
How? Why did you bring me back?

804
01:22:11,445 --> 01:22:13,739
我需要你的帮助 来吧！
I need your help. Come on.

805
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,562
操作控制器！
Do something with these controls.

806
01:22:45,562 --> 01:22:48,106
我在操作
I am on it.

807
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:50,150
主控制程序 整个系统的心脏
The MCP, it's the heart of the whole system.

808
01:23:14,174 --> 01:23:17,886
我感觉到一个存在 平台上有另一个斗士
I feel a presence. Another warrior is on the mesa.

809
01:23:20,889 --> 01:23:22,807
萨克！
Sark.

810
01:23:25,393 --> 01:23:28,188
我们越来越近
We're getting closer.

811
01:23:31,858 --> 01:23:33,777
我不知道你是怎么幸存下来的
I don't know how you survived.

812
01:23:33,777 --> 01:23:36,988
那无关紧要
Slave, it doesn't matter.

813
01:23:36,988 --> 01:23:40,325
准备受死吧
Prepare to terminate.

814
01:23:52,254 --> 01:23:55,507
所有的程序都是有用的
