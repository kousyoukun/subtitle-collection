1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,460
Give me room.
Here we go.

2
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,030
- What's this game called?
- Lightcycle.

3
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,970
Damn!

4
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,870
You're getting brutal
and needlessly sadistic, Sark.

5
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,420
Thank you,
Master Control.

6
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,420
We've kidnapped
military programs.

7
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,090
I can arrange more
lethal matches.

8
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,340
- Interested?
- Sure.

9
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,930
I'd love to go up against
one of those guys.

10
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,890
It'd make a nice break from
those accounting cream puffs.

11
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,400
- What branch of the service?
- Strategic Air Command.

12
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,240
Nice!

13
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,950
Look. This is
all a mistake.

14
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,290
I'm just a compound
interest program.

15
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,080
I work at a
savings and loan.

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,790
- I can't play these video games!
- Sure you can.

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,050
- You look like a natural athlete.
- Me?

18
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,090
I get out of breath
checking on T-bill rates.

19
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,970
You're gonna make my User,
Mr. Henderson, very angry.

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,650
- He's a Full Branch Manager.
- Another religious nut!

21
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,280
I'd say
"Welcome, friend",

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,030
but not here.

23
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,280
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

24
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,420
Do you believe
in the Users?

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,170
Sure. If I
don't have a User,

26
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,130
who wrote me?
- That's what you're doing here.

27
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,220
Master Control Program's been
snapping up all us programs who believe.

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,220
If you're useful,
he takes over all your functions.

29
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,690
If he can't use you, he sends you
here to get your bits blasted.

30
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,400
- What's your name?
- Crom.

31
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm Ram.

32
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,200
They'll train you
for the games,

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,700
but... I hope you make it.

34
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,250
What's been going on
in the other sectors?

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,300
I've been stuck here
for 200 microcycles.

36
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,050
It's murder
out there.

37
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,510
You can't travel in
your own microcircuits...

38
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,480
without permission from
Master Control Program.

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,110
Sending me to play games.
Who does he calculate he is?

40
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,990
Okay, Clu,

41
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,080
tonight we check everything
in the right hand column.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,420
Where are you?
There you are.

43
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,090
- Clu?
- Yes, sir.

44
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,010
- This is top priority.
- I know, sir.

45
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,140
It isn't just correcting my
bank statement or phone bill.

46
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,140
- This is a must!
- I understand.

47
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,480
I wrote you and taught you
everything about the system.

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,520
- Thank you, but...
- No buts. That's for users.

49
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,820
You're the best program
ever written.

50
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,570
- You're dogged and relentless.
- Let me at 'em.

51
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,530
That's the spirit.
Keep that tank rolling.

52
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,540
I'll cover you
from this end.

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,690
You think we can merge
with this memory, Bit?

54
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,320
Yes.

55
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,570
Hmm.

56
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,540
Flynn is saying
to look over here.

57
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,710
I don't see what
we're looking for.

58
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,600
Come on, you scuzzy data,
be in there.

59
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,440
Uh-oh!

60
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,700
We've got company.

61
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,500
I don't
believe this.

62
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,080
A Recognizer.

63
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,480
There's too many!

64
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,140
What is this?

65
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,070
Ahhh!

66
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,120
Dammit!

67
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,380
Get out of here!

68
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,380
Yes-yes-yes.

69
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,520
Busted again!

70
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,700
That was my
best program.

71
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,260
Got a pirate program here.
Says his name's Clu.

72
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,380
What did he pull?

73
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,390
He came into the system
with a stolen password.

74
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,310
We caught him trying to
raid our high-clearance memory.

75
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,730
No! I must've
gotten in by mistake.

76
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,780
- Who programmed you?
- I was simp-

77
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,700
Ahhh!

78
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,790
You're in trouble,
program.

79
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,840
Make it easy on yourself.
Who's your User?

80
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,840
Forget it,

81
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,430
Mister High And Mighty
Master Control.

82
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,260
You aren't
making me talk.

83
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,180
Suit yourself.

84
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,440
Ahhh!

85
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,460
Get me Dillinger.

86
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,320
Good evening,
Mr. Dillinger.

87
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,620
- Thank you, Peter. You can go now.
- Yes, sir.

88
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,820
No problem, Master C.
If you've seen...

89
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,490
one electronics show,
you've seen them all.

90
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,990
What's up?

91
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,670
- Flynn?
- Yes.

92
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,920
He's looking for that old file.
Can't you appropriate it?

93
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,090
I put it in my memory
which he hasn't located.

94
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,350
- He might find it.
- I'm afraid so.

95
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,650
I spotted him this time
and kept him out.

96
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,810
It's getting trickier.

97
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,360
We should shut down
all access...

98
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,110
until we find
that Flynn.

99
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,040
- There's a 68.71% chance you're right.
- Cute.

100
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,830
Come on!

101
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,050
Alan, think I can have
some of your popcorn?

102
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,380
Yeah, sure.

103
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,720
Sit down.

104
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,180
Thank you.

105
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,430
We've had
to shut down...

106
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,890
all Group-7
personnel...

107
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,150
just briefly.
Security.

108
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,440
Someone has
been tampering.

109
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,990
You don't think
it's me!

110
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,740
I don't even balance
my checkbook on downtime.

111
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,700
It'll only be
a couple of days.

112
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,880
- What's your project?
- It's called Tron.

113
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,460
It's a
security program.

114
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,010
It monitors contacts between
our system and others.

115
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,060
Anything not scheduled,
it shuts it down.

116
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,730
I sent you
a memo.

117
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,230
- Part of the Master Control Program?
- No.

118
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,320
It'll run independently
and watchdog the MCP as well.

119
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,450
Sounds good.

120
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,000
We should have you running
in a couple of days.

121
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,500
I hope.

122
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,170
Okay.

123
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,170
Thanks.

124
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,650
Oh, boy.

125
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,240
Mr. Dillinger, I'm very
disappointed in you.

126
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,870
I'm sorry.

127
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,910
I can't afford an independent
programmer monitoring me.

128
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,380
You realize how many
systems I've gone into?

129
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,340
How many programs
I've appropriated?

130
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,260
Come on!

131
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,930
A couple of days!

132
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,210
Hi, Dr Gibbs.

133
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Here goes nothing.

134
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,130
You hear what
you just said?

135
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,220
"Here goes nothing".

136
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,550
Actually, we propose
to change something...

137
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,970
into nothing
and back again.

138
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,860
You might have said, "Here goes
something, here comes nothing".

139
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,020
Right.

140
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,030
This is the
big moment.

141
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,290
This'll narrow your theory
that the scan U-V beam...

142
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,170
is superior to
single pulse exposure.

143
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,840
Laser activity will
exist in 30 seconds.

144
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,470
Put on your goggles.
Leave the bay.

145
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,430
Let's see if we've
got the green light.

146
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,930
- Target area shielded?
- They verified safety.

147
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,850
20 seconds.

148
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,360
- Looks good.
- Let her rip.

149
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,570
This is what we've
been waiting for.

150
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,570
10 seconds.

151
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,120
5 seconds.

152
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,150
Perfect!

153
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,570
- Beautiful!
- Hi, Alan.

154
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,610
Having fun
disintegrating things?

155
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,790
Not disintegrating,
digitizing.

156
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,460
A laser dismantles
the molecular structure.

157
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,630
Molecules remain suspended
in the laser beam.

158
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,010
When the computer
plays out the model,

159
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,300
the molecules
fall back into place,

160
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,180
and voil?
- Great.

161
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,350
Can it send me
to Hawaii?

162
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,560
You've got to purchase
your program 30 days in advance.

163
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,320
- How's it going upstairs?
- Frustrating.

164
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,490
I had Tron
almost ready...

165
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,620
when Dillinger cut everyone
with Group-7 access out.

166
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,620
Ever since
he got...

167
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,700
that Master
Control Program,

168
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,290
the system's got more
bugs than a bait store.

169
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,960
You gotta expect
some static.

170
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,090
Computers are machines.
They can't think.

171
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,720
- Some programs will be thinking soon.

172
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,390
Computers will
start thinking,

173
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,060
and the people
will stop.

174
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm gonna put
some data through.

175
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,690
- See you.
- Bye.

176
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,690
Come on.

177
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,240
- Did you say Group-7 access?
- Yeah.

178
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,540
What a hassle.
l was all set.

179
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,290
- Did he say why?
- Something about tampering.

180
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,420
Flynn has been
thinking...

181
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
about breaking
into the system...

182
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,630
ever since
Dillinger canned him.

183
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,220
And he had
Group-7 access.

184
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,720
Flynn had access
to you, too.

185
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,270
I want to go
to Flynn's place.

186
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,480
- What for?
- To warn him.

187
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,950
- Of what?
- That Dillinger's onto him.

188
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,370
I don't see why I have
to do that guy any favors!

189
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,290
I don't know what
you saw in that guy.

190
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,420
I loved him for his brain.

191
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,300
Don't put change
in the meter.

192
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,930
We're gonna need
it for the games.

193
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,100
Boy! I haven't been
here in a long time.

194
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,370
Hey, Bobby,
up here.

195
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,980
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

196
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,190
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

197
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,820
Somewhere in here lost
in one of his games.

198
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,370
- Do you know where Flynn is?
- On his machine.

199
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,430
He's really on
a roll!

200
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,180
One more Reco
before he ties.

201
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,230
Another Reco and he gets
the world's record.

202
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,320
He's going for
the record.

203
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,700
The all-time
record coming up.

204
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,300
This is it.
It's all over.

205
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,550
Flynn's gonna make him
a part of history!

206
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,310
Flynn,
how'd you do it?

207
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,650
It's all
in the wrists.

208
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,360
999,000 points!

209
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,530
Hey, good
to see you guys.

210
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Nothing classes up the joint
like a clean-cut couple.

211
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,630
We gotta talk.

212
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,880
You can't hear yourself
think in here. Come on.

213
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,340
- Come on.
- I'll be down in a minute.

214
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,270
How's the world
of serious science?

215
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,350
Go make yourselves
at home.

216
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,110
The best programmer
Encom ever saw,

217
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,820
and he winds up playing
space cowboy...

218
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,500
in some back room.
- Let me handle this.

219
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,920
- Go right ahead.
- Have you been sneaking...

220
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,130
into the
Encom system?

221
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,010
You never were much
for small talk.

222
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,270
Does she still leave
her clothes all over?

223
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,600
- No!
- Alan!

224
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,100
I mean,
not that often.

225
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,230
You can see why
all his friends...

226
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,940
- are 14 years old.
- Touch?

227
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,500
I have been doing
a little hacking.

228
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,250
- You did break in.
- Tried to.

229
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,880
I can't seem to quite
get the connection.

230
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,140
- If I had a direct terminal...
- Flynn, are you embezzling?

231
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,690
Embezzling is such an
ugly word, Mr. Bradley.

232
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,820
Actually, I'm trying to
get some evidence together.

233
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,570
- I don't get it.
- Okay.

234
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,240
- I don't get it.
- Okay.

235
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,660
Sherman, set the Way-Back
Machine for 3 years ago.

236
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,460
Kevin Flynn,
one of Encom's...

237
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,670
brightest young
software engineers.

238
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,260
He's so bright that
he goes in at night,

239
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,350
and begins writing a
program for video games...

240
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,810
called
"Space Paranoids".

241
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,230
You invented
"Space Paranoids"?

242
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
"Paranoids", "Matrix Blaster",
a whole slew of 'em.

243
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,530
I was this close to starting
my own enterprise.

244
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,540
But enter another;
not so young or so bright,

245
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,960
but very sneaky;

246
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,960
Ed Dillinger.

247
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,300
One night,
our boy Flynn...

248
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,220
goes to his terminal,
tries to read up his file.

249
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,640
I get nothing.
There's a big blank.

250
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,060
3 months later...

251
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,730
Dillinger presents Encom
with 5 video games...

252
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,940
that he's invented.

253
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,240
The slime didn't even
change the names!

254
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,280
He gets a
big promotion.

255
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,910
Thus begins his
meteoric rise...

256
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,540
to...
What is he?

257
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,540
- Senior Exec.
- Senior Exec?

258
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,340
Meanwhile,
the kids...

259
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,800
are putting 8 million quarters
a week into Paranoid machines.

260
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,720
I don't see a dime, except
what I squeeze outta here.

261
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,940
I still don't understand
why you want to break in.

262
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,820
Somewhere in one of these
memories is the evidence.

263
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,910
If I got in far enough
l could reconstruct it.

264
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,330
- My password, Dillinger's
instructions to divert...
- Too late!

265
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,120
Dillinger's cut off
Group-7 access.

266
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,630
Wait. What
are you saying?

267
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,800
The guy knows
what you're up to.

268
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,050
Great.
You're kidding me?

269
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,100
Now there is
nothing to stop him.

270
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,610
It's just Dillinger and
the MCP running things.

271
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,610
Not if my Tron
program was running.

272
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,780
That'd shut
the system down.

273
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,120
If your file
was in there...

274
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,550
If we can get in there,
I can forge a Group-6 access.

275
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,590
Well?

276
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,720
Shall we dance?

277
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,690
I shut down Group-7
for a very good reason.

278
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,950
If our people can't get
access to their programs...

279
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,040
You know how frustrating
it is when you're researching.

280
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,580
I sympathize, but l
have data coming from MCP...

281
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,170
telling me there's
something screwy going on.

282
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,880
That MCP is
half our problem!

283
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,010
The MCP is the most efficient
way of handling what we do!

284
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,890
I can't worry about
every user request.

285
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,560
User requests are
what computers are for.

286
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,270
Doing our business is
what computers are for!

287
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,590
Encom isn't the business
you started in your garage.

288
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,930
We've accounts in 30 countries,
new defense systems,

289
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,350
one of the most sophisticated
pieces of equipment.

290
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,350
I know all that.

291
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,320
Sometimes I wish I were
back in that garage.

292
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,610
That can be arranged,
Walter.

293
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,290
That was
uncalled for.

294
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,460
You can remove Alan and me,
but we helped create it.

295
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,840
Our spirit remains in
every program we designed.

296
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,390
Walter, it's getting late.
I've got better things to do.

297
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,350
Don't worry about
Encom anymore.

298
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,480
It's out of
your hands now.

299
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,820
I don't think
I'm cleared for this.

300
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,290
- I'm certainly not.
- Want to move aside?

301
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,710
Give the kid
a little room.

302
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,750
This guy's a little
like Santa Claus.

303
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,260
I make these myself.
You want one?

304
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,490
They never should have
gotten rid of me.

305
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,500
- Now that is a big door.
- Shut up.

306
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,050
I programmed you
to want too much.

307
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,310
I was planning
to hit the Pentagon.

308
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,310
The Pentagon?

309
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,820
It shouldn't be harder
than any big company.

310
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,700
- This is what I get for using humans.
- I wrote you!

311
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,750
What do you want
with the Pentagon?

312
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,380
The same thing I want
with the Kremlin.

313
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,510
With the information
l can access,

314
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,470
I can run things 900 to 1200
times better than any human.

315
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,350
If you think
you're superior to us...

316
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,770
You wouldn't want me
to dig up Flynn's file...

317
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,690
- and read it up on a VDT at the Times.
- You wouldn't dare!

318
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,950
Hi.

319
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,420
Hi.
Working late?

320
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,420
Yeah.

321
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,050
Okay.
Come here.

322
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,010
I'm gonna put him
at my terminal...

323
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,600
and meet you in
your office upstairs.

324
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,900
Don't fall asleep.
If and when I activate Tron,

325
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,150
you'll only have
a few minutes...

326
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,400
before Dillinger
catches the break.

327
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,110
As long as we
stay off the top floor,

328
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,830
Dillinger will never know
we've been in here.

329
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,040
Good luck, hot shot.

330
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,700
- Ahem.
- Flynn!

331
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,740
After you.

332
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,900
Keep those programers
out of the system.

333
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,990
Get me that
Chinese language file.

334
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,890
- You are going to stick with me?
- What for?

335
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,230
You're the one who never
needed help, remember?

336
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,190
I'm scared of the dark.
All this technology scares me.

337
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,570
This way!

338
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,950
- When did they put this in?
- This is where I work.

339
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,460
I've got a direct terminal
in the laser target area.

340
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,840
You can stay there
all night.

341
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,510
Like a man says,

342
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,390
"There's no problems,
only solutions".

343
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,730
Remember, this lazer
is my life's work.

344
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,900
Don't spill anything.
Huh?

345
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,450
Have fun,
sweetheart.

346
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,770
Hey, it's the big
Master Control Program.

347
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,690
Sit right there.
Make yourself comfortable.

348
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,690
Remember the time we spent
playing chess together?

349
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,290
Stop! Please.

350
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,210
You realize
l can't allow this?

351
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,540
How are you gonna
run the universe...

352
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,090
if you can't answer
unsolvable problems?

353
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,470
Let's see
what you've got.

354
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,180
I'd like to see
what you're made of.

355
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,770
You don't look a thing
like your pictures.

356
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,480
You're entering
a big error.

357
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,110
I'm going to put you
on the game grid.

358
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,770
You want games?

359
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,030
This isn't
happening.

360
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,950
It only thinks
it's happening.

361
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,330
Vacate entry port,
program.

362
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,340
I said,
move!

363
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,800
Ah!

364
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,970
Hey!

365
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,100
Look, if this is about
those parking tickets,

366
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,480
I can explain
everything.

367
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,780
Prepare all programs
for war games.

368
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,870
I've got a challenge
for you, Sark; a new recruit.

369
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,090
It's a tough case, but
treat it in the usual manner.

370
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,460
Train him
for the games,

371
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,800
let him hope,
then blow him away.

372
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,760
You've got it.

373
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,640
I've been hoping you'd send me
somebody with a little guts.

374
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,190
What kind
of program is he?

375
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,900
He's not any kind of program.
He's a User.

376
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,150
- A User?
- That's right.

377
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,700
He pushed me
in the real world.

378
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,740
Somebody pushes me, I push back.
So I brought him here.

379
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,460
What's the matter?
You look nervous.

380
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,130
Well, I was just...

381
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,680
I don't know.
A User, I mean...

382
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,430
Users wrote us.

383
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,770
A User even
wrote you!

384
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,360
No one User wrote me. I'm worth
millions of their man-years.

385
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,860
What if...?

386
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,910
You'd rather take
your chances with me?

387
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,700
Want me to slow down
your power cycles?

388
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,790
I need that!

389
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,210
Then pull yourself together.
Get this clown trained.

390
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,840
I want him in the games
until he dies playing.

391
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,260
Acknowledge.

392
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,220
Acknowledged,
Master Control.

393
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,600
End of line.

394
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,360
Game unit 18.
In here, program.

395
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,530
Who you calling
"program", program?

396
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,280
Ah!

397
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,950
New guy?

398
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,370
Another free program
off line.

399
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,960
You think the Users
are still there?

400
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,960
They'd better be.

401
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,470
I don't want to
bust out of here...

402
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,930
and find nothing
but cold circuits.

403
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,430
Hey.

404
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,190
- Who are you guys?
- Hold it!

405
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,190
Watch those
force fields.

406
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,360
You'll be having plenty
of chances to get hurt.

407
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,240
Just so I can
tell my friends...

408
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,790
what this
dream is about,

409
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,870
where am l?

410
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,630
You're a...

411
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,680
guest of the
Master Control Program.

412
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,640
Oh, great.

413
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,230
- He makes you play video games.
- No sweat.

414
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,610
I play video games
better than anybody.

415
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,160
Move out!
This way.

416
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,750
You, you come
this way.

417
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,010
- I've gotta see the guy in charge.
- You will.

418
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,870
Look operative.

419
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,420
Command Program Sark's
carrier is approaching.

420
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,000
He will explain the
training procedures.

421
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,350
Greetings.

422
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,270
The Master Control Program
has chosen you...

423
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,110
to serve your system
on the game grid.

424
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,450
Those of you
who continue...

425
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,160
to profess a belief
in the Users...

426
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,210
will receive the standard
substandard training,

427
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,090
which will result in
your eventual elimination.

428
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,380
Those of you...

429
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,630
who renounce...

430
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,390
this superstitious
and hysterical belief,

431
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,270
will be eligible
to join the warrior elite...

432
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,400
of the MCP.

433
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,190
You will each receive
an identity disk.

434
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Everything
you do or learn...

435
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,200
will be imprinted
on this disk.

436
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,540
If you lose your disk
or fail to follow commands,

437
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,420
you will be subject
to immediate de-resolution.

438
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,550
That will be all.

439
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,890
Move out.

440
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,870
Who's that guy?

441
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,830
Tron. He fights
for the Users.

442
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,140
That's pretty good.

443
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,350
You gotta be good
if you want to survive.

444
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,440
What's your name?

445
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,650
My name's Ram.

446
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,940
Hey, Ram,

447
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,490
what were you
before?

448
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,240
I was an
actuarial program.

449
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,790
I worked for a big
insurance company.

450
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,460
Really gives you
a great feeling...

451
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,460
helping folks plan
for their future needs.

452
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,300
If you think of the
payments as an annuity,

453
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,720
the cost is
quite minimal.

454
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,060
Yeah, that's great.

455
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,850
Actuarial program. Nice.

456
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,940
How about yourself?

457
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,770
I don't remember
too much.

458
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Name's Flynn.

459
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,570
Disorientation
is normal in transport.

460
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,700
It'll come back.

461
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,000
This is it.
Good luck, Flynn.

462
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,760
Sir, conscript
being moved...

463
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,300
from pit cell
to ring game.

464
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,800
Hey!

465
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,430
You guys sure
are friendly.

466
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,930
Wait.

467
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,150
Let him fight
one of his own kind.

468
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,160
You think you're
gonna wipe me out?

469
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,290
No...

470
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,540
Hey!

471
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,350
That new guy was
asking about you.

472
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,640
Too bad
he's in a match.

473
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,900
I'll probably
never meet him.

474
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,820
You might.

475
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,320
There's something
different about him.

476
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,670
Okay.

477
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,540
That was
a very fancy shot.

478
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,510
Okay, here's
an easy one.

479
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,820
Finish the game!

480
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,490
- No!
- Kill him.

481
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,370
No.

482
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,630
You'll regret this.

483
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,770
Ahh!

484
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,110
I want him in the games
until he dies playing.

485
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,390
This is the holding area
for the lightcycles.

486
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,260
You made it!

487
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,100
Wait here.

488
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,270
Alan.

489
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,270
Where did you
hear that name?

490
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,650
- That's your name.
- The name of my User.

491
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,790
How did
you know?

492
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,920
- I'm a program
from a User that knows Alan.
- He's disoriented, Tron.

493
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,750
I'm remembering
all kinds of stuff,

494
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,180
like my User wants me
to go after the MCP.

495
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,180
- My User wants that, too.
- I know.

496
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,910
Prepare to transport
to lightcycle grid.

497
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,210
We have
transport.

498
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,460
Wow.

499
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,310
This is Blue Leader
to Blue bikes.

500
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,980
Run these guys
into your jet walls.

501
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,020
Copy, Blue Leader.

502
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,860
This is Gold-1
to Gold-2 and 3.

503
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,240
Split up.
Take them one on one.

504
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,950
Watch it!

505
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,620
Ahh!

506
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,020
Taking him
into the maze.

507
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,660
This is it.
Come on.

508
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,220
Gold-3 to
Gold-2 and 1.

509
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,680
I'm getting out of here
and you guys are invited.

510
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,810
Got it.

511
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,060
Ready?

512
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,690
- Ready.
- So long, sucker!

513
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,190
Ahh!

514
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,930
Greetings, programs!

515
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,850
Warriors escaping game grid.
This is an illegal exit.

516
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,650
You must return to game grid.
This is an illegal exit.

517
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,280
Gold-2 to Gold-3.

518
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,410
Those demons
are coming down.

519
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,880
Get them!

520
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,800
Send out every
game tank in the grid.

521
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,800
Get them!

522
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,850
I should never have written
all those tank programs.

523
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,460
Targets leaving
protective field.

524
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,840
Missed!

525
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,390
All units
exiting game arena.

526
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,630
Target units
accelerating!

527
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,320
Pursuit force
minus one tank.

528
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,400
Close ranks.

529
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,810
Oh, man.

530
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,150
On the other side
of the screen,

531
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,650
it all looked
so easy.

532
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,580
They must've gone
right past us.

533
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,670
We made it...

534
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,050
this far.

535
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,600
Pursuit force reporting.
We lost visual contact.

536
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,150
Get the pursuit forces
back into the canyons.

537
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,020
Those programs
never made it out.

538
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,450
We'll have them back
before the Interrupt Interface.

539
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,620
We'd better,
null unit.

540
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,000
I'll be lucky if the MCP
doesn't blast me.

541
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,040
I want those
conscripts!

542
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,640
What is it?
What do you see?

543
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,680
Watch it.

544
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,690
Come on,
you little bugger.

545
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,070
Look at that.

546
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,240
When do we pay
our visit...

547
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,540
to the old
Master Control?

548
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,250
What?

549
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,380
There's
just 3 of us.

550
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,010
If you know anybody who's
got an army for rent, fine,

551
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,220
but my User told me
to take that sucker out,

552
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,470
or I'm never
getting out.

553
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,890
We can't get
to the MCP...

554
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,560
without the help
of my User.

555
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,980
I have to get to that
Input/Output tower,

556
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,030
and communicate
with him.

557
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,870
Check in with Alan.
Maybe he knows...

558
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:58,120
What's that?

559
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,000
That...
is just...

560
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,960
what I need
right now.

561
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,200
Oh, it's nice.

562
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,210
Incredible.

563
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,140
Boy, you forget how good
the power feels...

564
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,190
until you get
to a pure source.

565
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,190
My friends,
my fellow conscripts,

566
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,450
we have scored!
l feel so much better.

567
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,420
Pursuit force reporting.
No sign of escaped units.

568
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,420
Moving into
next sector.

569
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,840
Thank you.

570
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,600
I can
feel it.

571
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,480
Feel what?
You okay?

572
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,730
Alan-1.

573
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,320
Let's move out!

574
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,960
Come on, Flynn,
put a cork in it.

575
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,380
One second!

576
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,220
Ahhh!

577
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,840
Range... 9,

578
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,770
Mark... 45,
48 degrees.

579
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,440
Hold it.

580
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,820
Hold it.
Fire!

581
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,840
Ram, Flynn,
do you read me?

582
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,680
Pursuit force reporting.
2 escaped units de-rezzed.

583
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,600
No!

584
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,660
Tron unit heading
into next sector.

585
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,920
Ram?

586
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,670
Come on!

587
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,590
We gotta get
outta here.

588
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,600
No sign
of life.

589
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,690
Looks like
we got 'em.

590
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,450
Continue pursuit of
remaining conscript.

591
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,500
Acknowledged. Proceeding
towards sector frontier.

592
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,380
We're gonna
make it, Ram.

593
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,050
We gotta find you
a place to rest.

594
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:59,910
Hang in there, Ram.
This looks like a good spot.

595
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,970
Those tanks won't
find us here.

596
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,970
Okay.

597
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,560
I thought this was
supposed to be easy.

598
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,400
What's going on?

599
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,200
You see this?

600
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:08,000
You shouldn't
be able to do that.

601
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,600
Now for some...

602
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,430
real User power.

603
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,890
Hey, this
looks promising.

604
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,200
This is just like
the old arcade grips.

605
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,540
Let's get this
show on the road.

606
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,180
Now we're smokin'!

607
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,010
How can you steal
a Recognizer?

608
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,060
You don't look good.
We'll get you fixed up.

609
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:26,940
Come here.

610
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,930
Oh, my User!

611
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,980
Users are Users.
They...

612
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,490
Are you a User?

613
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,300
Flynn,

614
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,640
help Tron.

615
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,700
Ram!

616
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,170
Ram?

617
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,940
Damn Recognizer.

618
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,190
The thing just
goes straight.

619
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,870
I gotta get to
that l/O tower.

620
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:44,660
Program Alu, request
additional information.

621
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,130
Prepare hanger for
game simulation transport.

622
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:52,050
Attention all units,
lock onto matrix code.

623
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,590
Prepare for
digital beam transport.

624
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,640
Activate
hanger doors.

625
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,390
What's the progress
on the simulation?

626
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,440
30, 56, 99
are correct.

627
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,280
Limited 4 and 8
are missing.

628
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,160
Don't scream.

629
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,960
Yori!

630
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,630
30, 56, 99
are correct.

631
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,090
- Limited 4 and 8 are missing.
- No, I...

632
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,810
Tron!

633
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,520
Ah!

634
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,110
Yori.

635
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,070
I knew
you'd escape.

636
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,200
They haven't built a circuit
that could hold you.

637
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,160
Listen!
We have to make plans.

638
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,750
Where
can we go?

639
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,670
This way, quickly.

640
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,140
Hey!

641
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,280
Hold it!

642
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,950
- Yes?
- What do you mean, "yes"?

643
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,490
Yes?

644
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:15,580
That all
you can say?

645
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,710
No.

646
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,420
- Anything else?
- Yes.

647
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,180
- Positive and negative, huh?
You're a bit.
- Yes.

648
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,390
Where's your program?
lsn't he gonna miss you?

649
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,060
No.

650
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,150
I'm your program?

651
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,560
Yes.

652
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,280
Another mouth
to feed.

653
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,740
Yes-yes-yes-yes!

654
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,880
Watch out
for nested macros.

655
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,680
- Who are these weirdos?
- Inoperative data pushers.

656
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,310
Control Programs!
Come on.

657
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,310
Pretty good drivin',
huh? Oh!

658
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,860
- No!
- Who asked you?

659
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,090
No-no-no-no!

660
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,970
Ahh!

661
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:51,830
This baby doesn't handle
so good in town.

662
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,380
- What's this do? How 'bout this one?
- No, no.

663
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,890
Here comes
a headache.

664
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,810
- Ahhh!
- No-no-no-no!

665
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,360
- We gotta stop this thing!
- Yes!

666
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,820
I'm glad you agree!

667
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,230
Uh, I'm fine.
No problem.

668
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,660
Oh, this town
is full of live ones.

669
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,510
This is where Tron
said he was going.

670
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,730
Losing Flynn.

671
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,100
I don't
believe this.

672
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,080
Halt!

673
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,720
More guards.

674
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,670
They don't see us.
I'll go first.

675
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Let's do that some more.

676
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,790
I think
the guard saw me.

677
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,590
Come on!

678
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,470
Halt.

679
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,060
Dumont.

680
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,230
I can't stand this commotion.
What do you want?

681
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,610
I've come to communicate
with my User.

682
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:49,280
Difficult...

683
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,280
proposition
at best.

684
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,370
I could be de-rezzed
for letting you in here.

685
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:59,620
They hate this tower. They'd
close it down if they dared.

686
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,880
They keep me around
in case...

687
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,670
one of them wants to
deal with the other world.

688
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,340
Dumont!

689
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:12,600
My User has information
that could...

690
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,390
make this a
free system again.

691
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,150
- Really!

692
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:21,070
You'd have programs
lined up to use this place,

693
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,780
and no MCP looking
over your shoulder.

694
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,370
When you've been in the
system as long as I have,

695
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,370
you hear many promises,
reassurances,

696
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:31,370
- many brave plans.
- Please?

697
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,500
The guards
are coming.

698
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,510
There they are
with the Guardian.

699
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,850
All right, Yori.

700
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,810
Who is your User,
program?

701
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,570
Alan-1.

702
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,820
He calls me.
May I pass?

703
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,030
All that is visible...

704
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:57,530
must grow
beyond itself,

705
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,250
and extend into the
realm of the invisible.

706
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:03,290
You may pass,
my friend.

707
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,350
The Tower Guardian
is helping him.

708
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,520
He thinks.

709
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,770
Bring in
the logic probe.

710
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,260
More power!

711
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,140
It's begun.

712
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,020
Tron, location query.
Confirm.

713
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,350
Confirmed, Alan-1.

714
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,480
I am creating the information
that will erase the MCP.

715
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:57,650
Dedicate yourself to getting
the disc into the heart...

716
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,780
of the MCP.

717
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:02,290
This interface is
located at its base.

718
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,710
We will not be able
to communicate again...

719
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,210
unless you succeed.

720
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,170
Go!

721
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:21,350
This is the key
to a new order.

722
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,020
This code disc
means freedom.

723
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:30,200
I think they're
breaking in.

724
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,500
- Thank you, Dumont.
- Hurry! The Users are waiting.

725
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,780
Dumont?

726
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,990
Where's the program?

727
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,080
What program?

728
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,420
Take him!

729
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:22,440
Stay close.

730
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:34,490
If I can get us on the
scanning transport beam,

731
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,620
this simulation
will take us...

732
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,620
across the game sea...

733
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,880
back into the
central computer.

734
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,310
Look out!

735
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,740
Ahhh!

736
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,910
Ahhh!

737
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:16,090
Commander, you've enjoyed
the power you've been given.

738
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,260
I wonder how you'd take to
working in a pocket calculator.

739
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,760
We did take care of
that User you sent us.

740
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,770
Incompetent zero.

741
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:27,100
Now you've got
2 renegade programs...

742
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:29,520
flying all over the system
in a stolen simulation.

743
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,230
I'll get them.
It's only a matter of time.

744
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,110
You've almost reached
your decision gate.

745
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,620
I can't spare you
any more time.

746
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,330
End of line.

747
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,760
It's me, Flynn!

748
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,170
Flynn!

749
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:52,180
- Greetings, program.
- You're alive!

750
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,600
Barely.

751
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,230
Yeah, I uh...

752
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,250
Where's Ram?

753
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:16,460
He didn't make it.

754
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,720
Come on.

755
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,540
Lora.

756
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,580
This is Flynn.
The one who busted me out.

757
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:48,170
Lora?

758
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,170
Well, then l
owe him some thanks.

759
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,260
It's no big deal.

760
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,980
I ought to know Lightcycle.
l wrote the program.

761
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,150
- You wrote the program?
- It's time I level with you.

762
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,150
I'm what you
call a User.

763
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,530
You're a User?

764
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,570
I took a wrong turn
somewhere.

765
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,870
If you are a User,

766
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,450
everything you've done
is according to a plan.

767
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,670
You wish.

768
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,880
You know what
it's like.

769
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,130
You keep doing what it looks
like you're supposed to,

770
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:22,130
no matter how crazy.

771
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:25,010
That's the way it is
for programs, yes.

772
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:28,930
Most of the time, that's
the way it is for Users, too.

773
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,520
Stranger and stranger.

774
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,230
So, nice looking ship
you got here.

775
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,220
What do you want done with
the Tower Guardian, Dumont?

776
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,270
Put him with
the others?

777
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,730
No, bit brain, prepare
him for inquisition.

778
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,900
I need a bit
of relaxation.

779
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,900
First, rezz up the
carrier for pursuit.

780
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,950
One other thing.
Don't think anymore.

781
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:12,120
I do the thinking
around here.

782
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,670
This isn't going to be easy.

783
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,260
If those grid bugs get us,
we've had it.

784
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,080
Had enough?

785
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,380
What do you want?
I'm busy.

786
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,840
Busy dying, you worn out
excuse for an old program.

787
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,130
Yes, I'm old.

788
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:00,100
Old enough to remember the MCP
when it was a chess program.

789
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:02,640
He started small
and he'll end small.

790
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:06,900
Very funny. Maybe I should
keep you around for a laugh.

791
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,120
- What's happening?
- Power surge in the MCP.

792
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,670
Get off this beam.

793
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,880
There isn't a junction
for 7 or 8 nano seconds.

794
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,390
- There's another beam!
- It's too far.

795
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,210
He's creating
a junction.

796
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,320
Did we make it?

797
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,320
Yeah.

798
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,580
Hurray for our side.

799
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,860
ls he de-rezzing?

800
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:48,080
No, but I couldn't
tell you why not.

801
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:53,960
I'm all in one piece.

802
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,500
I'm still with you.

803
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:59,590
Ohhh!

804
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,840
Tell the guy with
the jackhammer to lay off.

805
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,430
How'd you do that?

806
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:07,180
Elementary physics: a beam of
energy can always be diverted.

807
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:09,060
Are we there yet, Mommy?

808
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,680
Sark!

809
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,950
Dumont!

810
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,370
Yori.

811
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,830
Tron?

812
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,460
Tron's dead.

813
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,300
Who's that?

814
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:38,930
That is a User.
He came here to help us.

815
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:42,480
Tron believed
in him.

816
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:46,900
If the Users can no longer
help us, we're lost.

817
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:49,700
So, we have erased
that program...

818
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,660
No.

819
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:54,620
- You were de-rezzed.
- Not me, Sark.

820
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,000
You're nothing special,
just an ordinary program.

821
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,840
So are you, one that
should have been erased.

822
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,960
You're nothing.

823
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:06,510
Take that program
to the holding pit.

824
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:16,110
Please!

825
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,910
I'm taking
our friend...

826
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:22,870
and some other religious
fanatics to Master Control.

827
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,580
When I disembark,

828
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:29,540
this ship and
everything on board...

829
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:32,090
will automatically de-rezz.

830
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,890
This means you.

831
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,190
Move on!

832
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,900
lmmediate vectors
detached.

833
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,940
Route us
to the MCP.

834
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,240
I want to get rid
of this dead weight,

835
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,780
and catch a transport beam
to the game domain.

836
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:36,170
These walls...
Yori, something's happening.

837
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,720
Hey.

838
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,730
I still have power.
Sark doesn't know that.

839
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,610
Leave me alone.
We've failed.

840
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:52,780
Only if we give up!
Come on, look, the wall!

841
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:57,200
Yori.

842
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:08,050
You brought
me back.

843
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:11,010
How? Why did
you bring me back?

844
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,600
I need your help.
Come on!

845
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,720
Do something with
these controls!

846
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,810
I'm on it.

847
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,810
The MCP, the heart
of the whole system.

848
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,350
I feel a presence.
Another warrior is on the mesa.

849
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,650
Sark!

850
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:27,990
We're getting
closer.

851
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,580
I don't know
how you survived.

852
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:36,790
It doesn't matter.

853
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,790
Prepare to
terminate.

854
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:55,440
All programs have
a desire to be useful.

855
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,530
In moments, you will
no longer seek communication...

856
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:02,200
with each other or
your superfluous Users.

857
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:06,000
You'll each be part of me.
Together we will be complete.

858
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,880
You should have
joined me.

859
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,890
We'd have made
a great team.

860
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:23,650
- You're very persistent.
- I'm also better than you.

861
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,290
Sark?

862
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:44,300
All my functions are
now yours. Take them.

863
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:47,850
Sark?

864
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,440
Sark?

865
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:00,950
Look!

866
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,350
Your User can't
help you now,

867
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,810
my little program.

868
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,320
I got it.
Steer us by the beam.

869
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,330
Right next to it.

870
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,330
What good will
that do?

871
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:40,500
I'm going
to jump.

872
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,710
It's the only way
to help Tron.

873
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,760
Don't.
You'll be de-rezzed.

874
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,040
Don't worry.

875
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,250
Come on, let's go!

876
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:02,770
We did it!

877
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:13,870
That's nice.

878
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,000
We thought you
were dead.

879
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,040
Where's Flynn?

880
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:20,840
He threw himself into the beam
and distracted the MCP...

881
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:24,890
just long enough for you
to get your disc in.

882
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:27,850
He saved us.
He really did it.

883
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:31,730
Look at
the I/O towers.

884
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:36,700
Every tower
is lighting up.

885
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,690
Priority one!

886
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,020
Try to
look official.

887
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,020
Here comes
the boss.

888
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,960
Pick me up
in an hour.

889
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,840
Greetings,
programs.
