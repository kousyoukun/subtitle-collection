1
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,397
我們發現了一些奇妙的東西！
I found something beautiful.

2
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,942
我簡直不敢相信，絕對是大、大、大驚喜！
I don't believe it!
Big, big, big surprise.

3
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,771
凱薩琳，過來！
Catherine, come.

4
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,549
那個時期的所有其他的主要建築物...
Every other major architectural structure at the time

5
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,801
...都只是被描述性的象形文字所覆蓋的
was covered with detailed hieroglyphics.

6
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,013
那些學術團體要到什麼時候才會接受...
When is the academic community
gonna accept the fact

7
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,185
第四王朝的法老沒有建造金字塔的事實
the Pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty
did not build the Great Pyramids?

8
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:20,315
看!  大家注意，在金字塔裡面沒有任何…
Look. Inside the pyramid, the most
incredible structure ever erected,

9
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,067
關於這奇跡般的建築…是如何建造的記載
there are no writings whatsoever.

10
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,155
傑克森教授. 你遺漏了如下事實...弗斯上校
Dr. Jackson. You've left out the fact that Colonel Vyse

11
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,450
弗斯上校在金字塔裡發現的…  - 說得好
- discovered quarrymen's inscriptions...
- Right.

12
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,953
刻有庫夫名字的採石工人的碑文
Of Khufu's name within the pyramid.

13
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,830
- 他的發現是個騙局
His discovery was a fraud.

14
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,500
- 我希望你能證明它！
Well, I hope you can prove it.

15
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,669
你認為是誰建造了金字塔？
Who do you think built the pyramids?

16
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,425
我也不知道是誰建造了金字塔
I don't have any idea who built them.

17
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,512
亞特蘭帝人？還是火星人？
Men from Atlantis?  Or Martians perhaps?

18
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,766
誰建造了金字塔不重要，而是它何時建的
The point is not who built them.
The point is when they were built.

19
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,144
我們都知道，新的地質證據表明獅身人面像
I mean, we all know new geological evidence

20
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,396
新的地質證據表明獅身人面像比金字塔要早得多
dates the Sphinx back to a much earlier period.

21
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:05,318
我們應當重新評價這一切，客觀地接受…
And knowing this, I think we have
to begin to reevaluate everything

22
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,404
我們應當重新評價這一切，客觀地接受…
we've come to accept about...

23
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:13,076
我能向大家展示一個完整的先進文字系統
I've been able to show a fully developed writing system

24
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,579
看起來應該是最早的兩代王朝的
appeared in the first two dynasties.

25
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:23,086
似乎是從更早的原型發展而來W
hich is almost as if it was based on
an even earlier prototype.

26
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,215
外面是有免費午餐還是怎麼的? 大夥兒都...
Is there a lunch or something that everybody...

27
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,691
傑克森博士！什麼事？
- Dr. Jackson.
- What? Yes?

28
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,985
有人想和你談談
Someone wants to speak with you.

29
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,321
美國空軍？ 這是什麼？
Air Force?
What's this? What is this?

30
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,740
請問你能否上車再談？
Will you step over to the car, please?

31
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,703
先生?
Sir?

32
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,625
- 我們要去哪裡？   - 請放心　
- Are we going somewhere?
- You're gonna be fine.

33
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,919
這些我們會保管的
We'll take care of these.

34
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,303
傑克森-- 這是你的父母？
Jackson, are those your parents?

35
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,850
是養父母
Foster parents.

36
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,646
- 這一切是怎麼回事？
- 一個工作
- What is this all about?   - A job.

37
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,442
哪一種工作？
- What kind of a job?
- Translation.

38
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,820
古埃及象形文的翻譯工作.
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

39
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,742
有興趣嗎？
Interested?

40
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,037
我現在應該走了
I'm gonna go now.

41
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,625
去哪裡？  你剛剛被你的房東趕了出來.
Go where? You've just been evicted
from your apartment.

42
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,293
你的獎學金已經用完了
Your grants have run out.

43
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,922
你所有的財產…也就是那兩個包了
Everything you own are in those two bags.

44
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,176
你需要證明你的理論是正確的
Want to prove that your theories are right?

45
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,429
這是你的機會
This is your chance.

46
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,851
- 這是什麼？    - 旅行計劃　
- What's this?  - Travel plans.

47
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,189
先生?
Sir?

48
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,348
歐尼爾太太？
Mrs. O'Neil?

49
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,101
請進來
Come on in.

50
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,068
- 歐尼爾太太，你先生在家嗎？
Mrs. O'Neil, is your husband at home?

51
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,987
- 是的
Yes.

52
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,824
妳覺得我們能和他談一下嗎？
Do you think we might be able to speak with him?

53
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,201
你去試試吧
You can try.

54
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,404
- 對不起，歐尼爾上校　　　　　　　
- 我們是隸屬於Ｗｅｓｔ將軍的部門的
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neil.  We're from General West's office.

55
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,577
長官?
Sir?

56
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,749
我們是來通知你恢復原職的
We're here to inform you that you've been reactivated.

57
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,798
那傢伙一團糟似的
The guy's a mess.

58
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,595
他怎麼會變成這樣的？
How'd he get like that?

59
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,223
他兒子死了.  玩手槍時意外走火打中自己
His kid died.  Accidentally shot himself.

60
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,767
天哪
Jesus!

61
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,875
放行
Cleared.

62
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,299
感冒？
Cold?

63
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,675
是過敏
Allergies.

64
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,555
總是在我旅行時發生
Always happens when I travel.

65
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,850
走這邊
There you go.

66
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,187
傑克森博士?  你好
- Dr. Jackson?
- Hello.

67
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,649
我是蓋雷·瑪亞博士, 你好嗎?
這是什麼地方？
- Dr. Gary Meyers. How are you?
- What is this place?

68
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,361
核彈發射井.  別擔心，它被完全地改造過了. 我是芭芭拉·蕭何.
Nuclear missile silo. Don't worry,
it's been converted. Barbara Shore.

69
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,487
- Hello.
- Hi.

70
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,467
傑克森，歡迎來到井裡  -你好
- OK, Jackson. Welcome to the well.
- Hello.

71
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,597
這是--    在哪找到這個的？
This is... Where'd you find this?

72
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,351
吉薩高原，１９２８年
Giza Plateau, 1928.

73
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,854
我從沒見過這種東西
I've never seen anything like this.

74
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,023
你當然沒見過.  沒人見過
Of course you haven't.   No one has.

75
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,733
這裡有兩行象形文字
There's two lines of hieroglyphs.

76
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,069
內部的軌跡是典型的文字形狀
The inner track has the classic figures,

77
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,364
但是外面那行就像中心圓角矩形裡的文字
but the outer track is like the cartouche in the center.

78
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,409
這種文字形狀和我們以前所發現的完全不同
It's got writing unlike we've ever found before.

79
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,414
那不是象形文.  這可能是某種宗教符號或者甲骨文
Those aren't hieroglyphics. They might be a form of hieratic, or maybe cuneiform.

80
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,420
內圈的符號翻譯錯了
Well, the translation of the inner track is wrong.

81
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,923
他們一定是用Budge翻譯法. 我不知道他們為什麼一直再版他的書
They must have used Budge. I don't know
why they keep reprinting his books.

82
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,676
你在幹什麼？
Excuse me? What are you doing?

83
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,471
-我們已經用過所有已知的方法了.
-這個詞用在這裡可真奇怪，「Gebeh」 嗯？
- We've used every known technique.
- Curious word to use, qebeh.

84
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,558
對然後是個副詞「ｓｅｄｊｅｍ- ｅｎ- ｅｆ」
- Yeah.   - Then an adverbial sejemenef.

85
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,228
然後「被封印和…被埋藏」
"Sealed... buried."

86
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,190
不好意思. 你在做什麼？
Excuse me. What are you doing?

87
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,192
這不是「棺材」
It's not "coffin."

88
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,361
這是「永遠」
"For all time."

89
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,825
究竟是誰這樣亂翻譯的?
Who the hell translated this?

90
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,869
我…我翻譯的
I did.

91
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,289
這應該是「在天空中存在了一百萬年的 Ra太陽神
Well, this should read, "A million years
into the sky is Ra, Sun God...

92
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,583
被永遠封印和埋葬起來了」
"sealed and buried for all time..."

93
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,627
這不是「通往天堂的門」
It's not "door to heaven."

94
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,420
這是…
"His...

95
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,719
「星際之門」
"Stargate."

96
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,351
為什麼軍方會對五千年前的古埃及門匾感興趣？
So, why is the military so interested
in 5,000-year-old Egyptian tablets?

97
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,603
我的報告上是一萬年前
My report says 10,000.

98
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,272
午安，上校
Good afternoon, Colonel.

99
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,696
我認識你嗎？
Do I know you?

100
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,157
傑克·歐尼爾上校，隸屬West將軍的部門
I'm Colonel Jack O'Neil from General West's office.

101
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,368
從現在起，我接管這裡
I'll be taking over from now on.

102
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,081
一萬年是可笑的，埃及文化那時還沒出現，直到…
The figure 10,000 is ludicrous.
Egyptian culture didn't exist...

103
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,418
我們知道，但是聲波和碳14測年法的結果是決定性的
We know, but the sonic and radiocarbon tests are conclusive.

104
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,796
- 這些是石頭蓋子？　　　
- 那下面是不是有個古墓？
These are cover stones.
Was there a tomb underneath?

105
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,675
不，但我們發現了一些更有趣的東西
No. But we found something
a lot more interesting.

106
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,387
抱歉.  這被列為機密了
Excuse me. This information has become classified.

107
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,142
現在起，如果沒有我的許可
From now on, no information is to be
passed on to nonmilitary personnel

108
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,395
任何消息都不可以透露給非軍方人員知道
without my express permission.

109
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,316
- 凱瑟琳，怎麼回事？
Catherine, what's going on here?

110
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,193
- 我也不知道
I'm not sure.

111
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,992
歐尼爾上校.  我想你應該給我一個解釋
Colonel O'Neil, I think you owe me an explanation.

112
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,329
我被告知有完全的自主權
I was told I had complete autonomy.

113
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
計劃改變
Plans change.

114
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,919
你為什麼在這？為什麼他們讓你參加這個項目？
Why are you here? Why did they bring you on this project?

115
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,757
我來這裡是以防萬一你成功了，我就接管這裡
I'm here in case you succeed.

116
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,475
徹底地搜尋了楔形文字...和王朝之前的其他史前象形文字的關聯
Completed search on cuneiform
and other predynastic hieroglyphics.

117
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,227
完全沒有一點匹配之處
No matches whatsoever.

118
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,564
我參考了所有資料，來比對圓形徽章上的符號
I've exhausted all reference material
comparing the cartouche's symbols

119
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,943
和那個時代所有已知文字都不同
against all known writing samples
from the period pre- and post.

120
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,738
仍然沒有共通之處
Still no similarities.

121
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,948
看來我沒機會得到酬勞了
I'm never gonna get paid.

122
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,902
我能借一下嗎？
Can I borrow this?

123
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,134
獵戶座
Orion.

124
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,676
-請坐這裡   -我想讓你認識一下瓦斯特將軍
- Right here.
- I'd like you to meet General West.

125
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,345
你好，將軍
Oh, hello.
Oh, right, General.

126
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,936
那你認為，你在14天裡就解決了…
他們兩年都沒有解決的難題？
So you think you've solved in 14 days
what they couldn't solve in two years?

127
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,189
兩年？
Two years?

128
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,027
洗耳恭聽
Anytime.

129
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,075
我有些資料給大家看
I have some stuff to look at.

130
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,245
請大家互相傳閱一下
Just pass them down.

131
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,583
你們得分享著來看  因為..
很抱歉,我沒有把這些資料弄夠人手一份
You'll have to share them.  I'm sorry. I don't have enough.

132
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,838
我們正看著的就是那石頭蓋子上的圖形
We're obviously looking at the picture of the cover stones.

133
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,798
現在  在外面的那行圖形
Now, on the outer track,

134
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,886
你們原來以為是可翻譯的文字..
these figures that you had believed
to be words to be translated

135
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,305
其實是...
were, in fact...

136
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,731
不好意思. 其實是星座坐標圖
Sorry about that.
Were, in fact, star constellations.

137
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,905
是按順序組成的地圖，或是一組不同的地址
Now, these constellations were placed
in a unique order forming a map.

138
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:21,368
七個點描述了通往一個目的地的路線
Seven points to outline a course
to a position and...

139
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:28,709
三維空間需要六個點，才能找到一個目的地
To find a destination within any three-dimensional space,

140
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:33,672
三維空間需要六個點，才能找到一個目的地
you need six points

141
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:38,093
三維空間需要六個點，才能找到一個目的地
to determine the exact location.

142
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,263
可是你說你需要七個點？
You said you needed seven points.

143
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,807
不是，六個點標明目的地
No, six for the destination.

144
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,769
不過要畫成路線圖，你還需要一個起點
But to chart a course, you need...

145
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,813
不過要畫成路線圖，你還需要一個起點
a point of origin.

146
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,317
反對！ 中心圓角矩形裡只有6個符號
Except there's only six symbols
in the cartouche.

147
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,195
第七個點不在這個東西裡面，
Well, the seventh actually isn't inside the cartouche.

148
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,532
它在下面, 用…
It's just below it here, designated by

149
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,618
一個小金字塔和…
a little pyramid...

150
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,329
和兩個…
with two...

151
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,581
有趣的…
funny...

152
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,917
對稱的小人
neat little guys and...

153
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,962
和一條從頂端引出來的直線來標明
funny little line coming out of the top.

154
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,009
總之…
Anyway...

155
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,429
-他成功了.    -不.
- He did it.  - No!

156
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,807
那個符號根本就沒有刻在設備上
That symbol isn't anywhere on the device.

157
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,017
什麼設備？
What device?

158
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,902
給他看
Show him.

159
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,489
這是什麼？
What is that?

160
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,909
這就是你說的「星際之門」
That's your Stargate.

161
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,206
來，傑克森
Come, Jackson.

162
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,669
技術人員請向指揮中心報到.
Technical personnel, report to command center.

163
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,675
打開監視器！監視器已經打開！
- Monitors up.
- Monitors are up.

164
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,429
米奇，請將細節播放在主監視器上
Mitch, bring up the details
on the center monitor.

165
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,643
主監視器播放細節
I've got details on.

166
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,246
停一下.  等一下
Hold it. Wait.

167
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,375
你們是否有…
Do you have a...

168
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,794
…這個，對不起
Oh. Here. Sorry.

169
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,879
嘿，嘿，嘿！不要…
Hey. Don't...

170
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,924
兩個圖形…在兩邊
Two figures on either side...

171
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,595
在太陽底下的金字塔邊祈禱
praying beside a pyramid,
with a sun directly above it.

172
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,266
他是對的，在我們面前的是完整的坐標
He's right.  It was in front of us the whole time.

173
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,811
瓦斯特將軍.
General West.

174
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,064
傑克森認出了第七個記號
Jackson has identified the seventh symbol.

175
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,273
繼續
Go ahead.

176
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,485
將第七個點輸入到計算機裡
Programming seventh symbol into computer.

177
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,821
坐標1鎖定，
Chevron one is holding.

178
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,281
坐標1準備就緒
Chevron one is locked in place.

179
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,536
能量輸出23%
Power output at 23%.

180
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,295
坐標２鎖定．
Chevron two is holding.

181
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,841
-運行中   -坐標２準備就緒
- Engaged.
- Chevron two is locked in place.

182
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,676
能量現在是３５％
We're at 35%.

183
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,972
進入紅色警報，所有人員撤離
We got a Condition Red at the gate.
Evacuate all personnel.

184
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
這就是在石蓋底下的東西？
This was under the cover stones?

185
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,941
是的，我父親在1928年發現了它
Yes. My father found it, 1928.

186
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,570
由一種地球上還沒有發現的礦物質構成
Made out of a mineral unlike any found on Earth.

187
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,114
坐標5準備就緒
Chevron five, locked in place.

188
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,991
能量輸出79%
79%.

189
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,037
坐標6正鎖定
Chevron six is holding.

190
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,332
坐標6準備就緒
Chevron six is locked in place.

191
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,044
我們以前就只能做到現在這一步
This is as far as we have ever been able to get.

192
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,891
第七座標無法鎖定！手動控制
Chevron seven!

193
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,772
坐標7已鎖定
Chevron seven is locked in place.

194
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,545
送入探測器
Send in the probe.

195
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,306
是的,長官.
Yes, sir.

196
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,184
記錄所有來自門內的信息
Record all information from the Stargate.

197
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,737
星際之門附近清場！
- Clear inner silo for approach.
- Clear inner silo.

198
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,074
它在自動導航！ 你能相信嗎？
It's guiding itself.  Can you believe that?

199
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,307
電波束自動鎖定了Kaliam星系的某個地點
Beam has locked itself onto a point
somewhere in the Kaliam galaxy.

200
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,643
這個點擁有質量，可能是衛星或大隕石
It has mass. It could be a moon or a large asteroid.

201
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,437
我們地球在哪裡？
Where are we on that map?

202
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,397
那個藍點
The blue dot.

203
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,741
一點也不錯，傑克森
That's right, Jackson.

204
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,244
它在已知宇宙的另一邊
It's on the other side of the known universe.

205
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,916
我們正失去信號
We're losing the signal.

206
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:32,341
這是探測器傳送給我們的
This is the information the probe sent back to us.

207
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,968
停格並放大！
Freeze and enhance.

208
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,513
你能清楚地看到門的那一邊
You can clearly see the gate on the other side.

209
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,808
這個門肯定是通向另一個世界的出入口
Both gates must've functioned as a doorway between our worlds.

210
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,895
這些數據表明有大氣層
These readings tell us it's an atmospheric match.

211
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:52,611
壓力，溫度，和…最重要的，氧氣
Barometric pressure, temperature,
and, most importantly, oxygen.

212
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,951
這些符號是不同的. 它們和我們星門上的符號不一樣
These markings are different.
They don't match the symbols on our gate.

213
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,286
這就是我們必須得中止項目的原因
That's why we may have to abort.

214
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,750
這個項目無任何指標，也沒有偵察任務
This project is for naught without a reconnaissance mission.

215
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,921
一旦到了那邊，我們就不得不破解他們星門上的標記
Once on the other side, we would have to
decipher the markings on their gate

216
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,883
這就相當於"為了帶隊回來而撥家裡的號"
and in essence, dial home in order to bring the team back.

217
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,345
基於這個新的資料  我不知道我們怎樣才能做到這一點
(指不知道如何破解另一個星際之門上的符號)
Based on this new information, I don't see how we can do that.

218
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,055
嗯, 我可以破解它
Well, I could do that.

219
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,606
你確定?
Are you sure?

220
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,196
絕對肯定
Positive.

221
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,414
滿嘴胡說八道
He's full of shit.

222
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,501
現在你是我們的成員了！
You're on the team.

223
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,423
你知道，這件事非常複雜
You understand this complicates things?

224
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,054
這就是我為什麼需要你的原因, 傑克
That's why I wanted you, Jack.

225
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,850
我們打開了一扇通往一無所知的世界之門
We've opened a doorway to a world we know nothing about.

226
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,321
傑克森
Jackson.

227
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,074
Hello. Hi.

228
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,870
-我有些東西給你   -不，我…
- I have something for you.
- No, I...

229
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,497
收下
Yes.

230
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,126
是我小時候，在發現星際之門找到了它
I found it with Stargate when I was a child.

231
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,462
它給我帶來了幸福
It has brought me luck.

232
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,052
你回來時再還給我
You can bring it back to me.

233
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,236
後備儲存器.  
Backup storage.

234
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,530
後備電源打開.
Reserve power on.

235
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,923
如果有什麼想說的，現在就說出來
If anybody has anything to say, now's the time to say it.

236
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,640
航向追蹤設定
Vector tracking set.

237
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,444
傑克森，還好嗎？  已經結束了.留下來陪他
Jackson! It's all right.
It's over. Stay with him.

238
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,698
傑克森，聽我說保持活動.  過一分鐘就好了
Jackson, just listen to me.
Keep moving. It wears off in a minute.

239
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,908
真爽的傳送!
What a rush!

240
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,956
準備行動
Prepare to move out.

241
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:41,269
- 分三個小隊，出發．
- 白隊，出發．
- Three teams, let's go.  - White team, go.

242
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,511
第二隊上！
Team two, move up.

243
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,564
安全.  沒有接觸.
Clear. No contact.

244
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,498
- 氧氣比例穩定　 - 環境和裡面相同
- O2 ratio stable.
- Conditions are similar to inside.

245
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,708
我要觀察一下四周.
I wanna take a look around.

246
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,629
移到上面那裡，好
Move up there. Good.

247
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,328
我就知道
I knew it.

248
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,125
1－3－3－2
1332.

249
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,462
報告
Report.

250
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,882
周圍四分之一英里，幾乎全是相同地形,長官
Our quarter-mile perimeter survey
is just about complete, sir.

251
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,431
把這個收起來，所有的人退進去
Wrap this up.  Get everybody back inside.

252
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:27,393
所有人在1小時後，通過星際之門回去
I want all you people back through the Stargate within the hour.

253
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,271
你也回去，上校？
You're coming with us, aren't you, Colonel?

254
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,734
- 長官？  
- 傑克森，開始破譯星際之門吧
- Sir?   - Jackson. Start working on the Stargate.

255
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,238
- 那都是幹什麼的？
- 我不知道，弗雷迪
- What's that all about?
- I don't know, Feretti.

256
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,365
我需要多一點時間
I'm gonna need more time.

257
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:45,245
我指的是,  這裡一定有更多的建築或者一些其他的文明遺跡
There's bound to be more structures here
or some other traces of civilization.

258
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,207
這次旅行不找這些.  只要求能返回和重建連接點
Not this trip. Just get back in there
and reestablish contact.

259
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,460
並非這麼簡單，這是吉薩大金字塔的複製品
It's not that easy. This is a replica
of the great Pyramid of Giza.

260
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:56,047
我們不打算發現一些象形文字或雕刻嗎？
We're not gonna find any hieroglyphic
inscriptions or carved relief.

261
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,800
我們需要在周圍多看一點
We really need to look around more.

262
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,263
你負責重新打開星際之門，你行還是不行？
Your job here is to realign the targate.
Can you do that or not?

263
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,808
我不能
I can't.

264
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,063
是你不能，還是你不願意？
You can't or you won't?

265
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:16,526
我能翻譯符號，但我需要知道它們的排列順序
I can decipher the symbols on the 
Stargate, but I need an order of alignment.

266
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:20,572
在地球上那些句子被刻在石碑上,這裡一定也有類似的東西
The order was on tablets on Earth and
there must be something like that here.

267
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,825
我只需要找到它就行了
I just need to find it.

268
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,707
你說的「找到」是什麼意思？  你沒說過還有這麼回事.
Find it? What do you mean, find it?
You didn't say you had to find anything.

269
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,586
-我是假定它們一定會在這裡 - 你假定？
- I assumed the tablets would be here.
- You assumed?

270
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:39,799
你這個說謊的混蛋！
你一個字也沒提到過要找東西的事!
You're a lying son of a bitch! You didn't say a word about finding anything!

271
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,930
在這裡建立營地，安排我們的補給品
Set up a camp down here.  Organize our supplies.

272
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,100
- 長官?   -- 你已經聽到給你的命令了
- Sir...
- You've got your orders.

273
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,533
- 你看我簡直不能相信我們被困在這裡了
- 弗雷迪，不要這種一臉世界末日的樣子
- I can't believe we're stuck here.
- Don't be such a doomsayer.

274
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,786
- 來，休息一下.  -就是  拜託.
- Give it a rest.   - Yes, please.

275
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,498
如果我們沒有很快回去, 他們就會在另一邊開啟星門的
If we're not back soon, they'll just turn on the gate from the other side.

276
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,334
沒那麼回事.  不是那樣子操作的
It doesn't work that way.

277
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,755
你看. 如果你不能在這邊開啟星門,我們就完蛋了,好發!
You see, if you don't turn it on from here,
we're screwed. OK?

278
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,216
所以告訴你，我們哪裡也去不了
So I'm telling you guys, we're not going anywhere.

279
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,843
閉嘴.
Shut up.

280
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,138
這是一個好帳篷！
It's a nice tent.

281
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,224
噢，我們每個人都有一個帳篷，真不錯
Oh, we each get a tent.  That's nice.

282
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,920
-這到底是什麼東西?   - 保溫毯子．我不需要這個
-What the hell is that?
-Thermal blanket. I don't need that.

283
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,005
去跟他"談談"
Talk to him.

284
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,096
我什麼都有，就缺可以遮陽的
- I got everything here but sunblock.
- Hey.

285
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:15,144
你現在是否該幹些什麼？  例如帶我們離開這裡！
Isn't there something you should be doing now, like getting us outta here?

286
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,196
爽足粉，
Foot powder.

287
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,031
真好
Great.

288
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,077
老兄，夠酷的
That's cold.

289
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,482
營地搭建完畢，長官
Base camp is up, sir.

290
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,794
傑克森在哪裡？
Where's Jackson?

291
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,767
沒事的，沒事的
It's OK. It's OK.

292
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,562
真是個好孩子
That's a good boy.

293
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,945
好孩子
Good boy.

294
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,532
你想要什麼？  
What? What do you want?

295
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,451
你要這個？
You want some of this?

296
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,578
來  給你.  你喜歡這個嗎?
Here you go. You like that?

297
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,081
這給你.  給你.
There you go. There you go.

298
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,708
我就決不會去餵食那個東西!
I wouldn't feed that thing!

299
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,710
上面有韁繩!
It's got a harness!

300
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,505
這是被馴化的！
It's domesticated!

301
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,302
該死!
Dammit!

302
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,179
鬆開繩子！
Let go of it!

303
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,899
救我啊!
Help me!

304
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,951
救我啊!
Help me!

305
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,993
你還好嗎, 傑克森？
You OK, Jackson?

306
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,589
離我遠點
Go away.

307
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,163
放輕鬆
Easy.

308
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,734
好吧，傑克森.  你上去交談
All right, Jackson.   You're on.

309
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,445
我？
Me?

310
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,323
你是語言專家，去和他們談談看
You're the linguist.  Try to talk to them.

311
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,867
- 你跟他說了什麼？   - 一句話也沒說
- What the hell did you say to him?
- Nothing.

312
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,097
沒事的
It's OK.

313
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,767
沒事的，沒事的. 看到了嗎?
It's OK. See?

314
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,666
主要成分：石英
Quartz primary element.

315
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,934
我聽不懂.  聽起來很熟悉，有點像柏柏爾語
I can't make it out.
It sounds familiar, a bit like Berber.

316
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,271
又或者是其他語言
Maybe it's Chadic or Amharic.

317
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,174
謝謝
Thank you.

318
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
這裡
Here.

319
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,889
- 這是什麼意思？
- 我完全不清楚
- What's that mean?   - I have no idea.

320
00:48:56,141 --> 00:49:00,271
-他正在邀請我們進去.   -你怎麼這麼肯定？
- He's inviting us to go with him.
- How can you be so sure?

321
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,441
因為他正在邀請我們和他一起走
Because he's inviting us to go with him.

322
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:11,448
我們正在尋找文明的跡象，現在找到了
We were looking for signs of civilization.
Obviously we've found it.

323
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,784
你要我把我們弄回家去  這是我們的最佳辦法
You want me to get us home, this is our best shot.

324
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:18,998
- 上校，他說得沒錯　　　　　
- 我分析了一下他們開採的礦物
Colonel, he's right. I took some readings on what they're mining back there.

325
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,583
和星際之門的成分完全一樣
It's the same material as the Stargate.

326
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,715
聯絡營地
Radio base camp.

327
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:32,344
告訴他們注意警戒，直到我們回去
Tell them to keep that area secured until we get back.

328
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,387
是，長官
Yes, sir.

329
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,935
-營地，回話．等等別掛．
-弗雷迪，我收到他們了.  過來!
- Base camp, come in.
- Feretti, I've got 'em. Come on.

330
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,605
是的,長官?
Yes, sir?

331
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,317
長官，你能再說一遍嗎？
Can you repeat that, sir?

332
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,237
- 歐尼爾上校說，保護好營地
- 看來要在這裡呆一段時間了．
Colonel O'Neil requested that you secure base camp. We'll be here for a while.

333
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,572
是，長官
OK, sir.

334
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,657
- 明白嗎？      - 是，長官
- You understand?   - Yes, sir.

335
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,370
- 他們怎麼說？
- 他們暫時不回來，好嗎
- So, what's the story?
- They're not coming back. OK?

336
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,539
我告訴你們這樣可不太妙
This is not good.

337
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,097
太陽神 Ra 之眼
The eye of Ra.

338
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,810
這是埃及太陽神
It's the Egyptian sun god.

339
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,230
他們認為，是太陽神送我們到這裡來的
They think he sent us here.

340
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:34,651
我正在想，他們為什麼帶我們到這裡來
Yeah. I wonder what could've given them that idea.

341
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,750
他們都去哪裡？
Where are they all going?

342
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,463
- 喂 喂，  
Come in. Come in.

343
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:58,133
- 弗雷迪! 我聽不見你說話
- 長官, 我聽不到
-Feretti, I can't hear you.  -Sir, I can't make this out.

344
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,260
弗雷迪，再說一遍
Feretti, say again.

345
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,223
我們必需放棄營地！
We have to abandon base camp!

346
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,392
重複，我們必需放棄營地！
Repeat!   We have to abandon base camp!

347
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:11,605
- 沒有用，在這種天氣下它運作不了的
- 弗利曼，我們走！
- It's useless! It won't work in this!
- Let's go!

348
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,192
-所有人退到裡面去！ 能拿多少就拿多少......
Everybody, back inside!
Come on, take what you can carry!

349
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,903
- 快點動作！　　　
- 電池包啊！要拿！
Get the battery pack!  Grab it!

350
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,083
我們立刻回去. 我們快走!
We're going back right now.  Let's go.

351
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,752
等一下
Wait. Wait.

352
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,363
過來這裡
Get over here.

353
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,805
待在這裡
Stay here.

354
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,490
那是什麼，上校？
What is it, Colonel?

355
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,576
大沙暴，正往這裡來
Sandstorm coming this way.

356
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,040
那真是個向所有人開槍的絕妙理由
That would've been an excellent reason to shoot everyone.

357
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,208
沙暴結束之前，我們將待在這裡
We'll stay until it's over.

358
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,153
回到金字塔裡去！
The pyramid!  Back into the pyramid!

359
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,158
這沙暴是從哪裡冒出來的？
Where the hell did that come from?

360
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,791
卡瓦斯基，布朗，你們聽到嗎？
Kawalsky, Brown, do you read?

361
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,979
Hey  傑克森.
我認為我們不應該吃這裡的任何食物
Hey, Jackson. I don't think we should eat any food here.

362
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,149
我不知道  他們也許會認為這是一種侮辱
They might consider that an insult.

363
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,913
好，現在不能冒犯他們，丹尼爾？
We don't want to offend them, now, do we, Daniel?

364
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,471
味道像雞肉
Tastes like chicken.

365
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,808
味道像雞肉.  不錯.
Tastes like chicken.  It's good.

366
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,359
味道像雞肉.
Tastes like chicken.

367
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,570
不錯！
Good.

368
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,787
-傑克森. 你說那是個埃及符號
-對，太陽之眼
- You said that was an Egyptian symbol.
- Yeah. The eye of Ra.

369
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:01,418
那麼理所當然的…他們是否也使用埃及象形文字？
Would you say it might stand to reason,
if they know one Egyptian symbol...

370
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,503
是的
Yes.

371
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,739
究竟發生了什麼事?
What the hell's going on?

372
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:38,038
好像書寫文字是被禁忌的
It seems like writing is forbidden to them.

373
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,004
什麼？ 啥?
What? What?

374
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,930
她們要我跟他們一起去. 我應該留下來嗎？
They want me to go with them.  Should I stay?

375
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,599
我跟她們去吧.  
I'll go with them.

376
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,684
我去嘍, 我不會有事的
I'll go. I'll be fine.

377
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,443
好的，很好
OK, that's good. All right.

378
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,572
非常好.   這什麼味道？
That's good.  What is that smell?

379
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:19,454
OK,  非常好. 我的手很乾淨了，非常...非常感謝
OK, that's good. My hands are pretty clean. Thank you very very much.

380
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,290
非常感謝  非常感謝
Thank you.  That was very nice.

381
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,835
非常好， 這很棒.
Thank you.  That was great.

382
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,087
我現在聞起來好多了
I smell much better now than...

383
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,381
好的  謝謝
Yes, thank you.

384
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:35,303
老天，我聞起來像頭犛牛
Christ.  I smell like a yak.

385
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,642
不  謝謝  不再需要了  謝謝
No, please, no more.  Please.

386
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:44,896
不再需要了  謝謝.  我很好，我很乾淨…
Please. No more.
I'm fine. I'm clean. I'm...

387
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:52,320
我想你又是一位來幫我梳洗的人
I thought you were one of the other cleaning...

388
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,463
不，不，不，你不必勉強做這個
You don't have to do that.
Please.

389
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,550
也許你應該離開，好嗎？
Maybe you should go. OK?

390
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,802
沒事的，也許你應該離開這裡
It's OK.  Maybe you should go.

391
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,847
不、不. 沒事，沒事，不會有問題的
It's OK. It's all right.

392
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,017
來. 讓我抓著這個.
Here. Let me grab this.

393
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,905
不，這是我的意思.
No, it's me.

394
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,990
我想要...謝謝你
I wanted to thank you.

395
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,534
我想要...我很...我很滿意
I'm very happy-

396
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,288
我想要...我很...我很滿意
Thank you.

397
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,174
丹尼爾
Daniel.

398
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,929
-丹尼爾    -不  Uh...我叫-
-Daniel.   - No. I'm...

399
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,101
我叫丹尼爾
Daniel. I'm Daniel.

400
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,480
茜琳
Sha'uri.

401
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,865
我們來自…
We came...

402
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,995
金字塔
Pyramid.

403
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,083
我們來自…金字塔
We came from the pyramid.

404
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,878
沒事的
It's OK.

405
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,838
不必介意
Never mind.

406
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,801
沒事的
It's OK.

407
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,165
地球
Earth.

408
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:15,380
你...你知道...你知道這個符號? 
You know the symbol?  You know this symbol?

409
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,799
你見過這些符號？
You've seen this symbol?

410
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,722
帶我去看.  
Show me.

411
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,890
你帶我去看.
You show me.

412
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,689
卡瓦斯基，這裡是基地，收到沒有？
Kawalsky, this is base.
Do you copy?

413
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,025
你正在浪費電池
You're wasting the battery.

414
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,695
沙暴裡收不到，等停了再試.
You'll never get anything in this storm.
Wait until it passes.

415
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,613
好吧.  
Yeah, right.

416
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,366
如果它會停止的話
If it passes.

417
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,412
我曾在中東駐紮，也沒見過這麼大的沙暴
I was stationed in the Middle East.
I've never seen anything like it.

418
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,872
對，對…
Yeah, yeah.

419
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:52,542
我不明白.  我們為什麼不自己開門回去
I don't understand. Why don't we just turn the gate back on ourselves?

420
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,545
-這有多難？   -- 要你命那麼難！
- Yeah. How hard can it be?
- That would be great.

421
01:01:55,587 --> 01:02:00,967
我們會因為弄錯順序來開啟那東西,然後傳送到外太空裡
We could turn it in the wrong order and
materialize the vacuum of outer space.

422
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:04,971
你知道，排列順序有多少種組合？
Do you have any idea how many possible
combinations there are on that thing?

423
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,182
不知道，多少種？
No. How many?

424
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,185
閉嘴
Shut up.

425
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,501
他媽出了什麼事？
What the hell is goin' on?

426
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,815
好!  散開
All right, spread out.

427
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,443
快! 動起來.
Let's move.

428
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,342
沒事的.  這只是個打火機
It's OK.  It's just a lighter.

429
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,846
看著
Watch.

430
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,640
看到了嗎？
See?

431
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,604
給你.  試試看.
Here. Try it.

432
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,868
對，這的確神奇
Yeah, it's pretty fabulous.

433
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,090
你做得對，
Ah, you're right.

434
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,258
吸煙的確是愚蠢的
It's pretty stupid.

435
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,891
No  你...留著吧
No, you keep it.

436
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,437
這是你的了
It's yours.

437
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,373
這是非常危險的！
It's dangerous!

438
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,231
這是什麼地方？
What is this place?

439
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,987

Here.

440
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,050
我會被詛咒的
I'll be damned.

441
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,055
什麼？
What?

442
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,815
還是沒有任何信號？
No signal at all?

443
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:37,316
沒有　
Nothing.

444
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,071
干擾太多？
More interference?

445
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,699
不是.
No.

446
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,742
他們就是不在那裡！
They're simply not there.

447
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,978
- 有他的跡象嗎？　　　　
- 長官，我沒能找到傑克森
- Any sign of him?
- I haven't been able to locate Jackson.

448
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,207
我們正在找傑克森
We're looking for Jackson.

449
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,336
傑克森，就是那個穿這件衣服的人
Jackson.  Guy who wears this jacket.

450
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:42,298
他有長長的、披下來的頭髮…不是，不是
He's got long hair that comes down... No.

451
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,888
他戴一付眼鏡.  那樣他就能看見東西
Wears glasses so he can see.

452
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,065
我想"白癡"這個詞對你們這些
傢伙來說一點意義都沒有  對吧?
I guess the word "dweeb" doesn't mean anything to you guys, does it?

453
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:03,194
我正在"X"行星上尋找一個穿綠軍裝的白癡
Yeah. Why not? I'm on Planet X looking for
a dweeb who wears green fatigues.

454
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,864
他穿件夾克衫，頭髮長得遮住了眼睛
He wears this jacket.
He's got long hair. It comes over his eyes.

455
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:10,368
他戴眼鏡而且還打噴嚏
He wears glasses and... sneezes.

456
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,127
小雞！小雞！
Chicken.

457
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,923
小雞！小雞人！對，你猜對了！
Chicken man!  You got it.

458
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,058
你想要這個？
You want this?

459
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,344
我還以為你不會說他們的語言
Thought you couldn't speak their language.

460
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,430
呵呵，嚇了我一跳
You scared me.

461
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,807
這是一種古埃及方言，自成一體
It's an ancient Egyptian dialect.

462
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,811
我是說這不像他們的其他文化,它是完全獨立地逐漸發展起來的
Like the rest of their culture,
it's evolved completely independently,

463
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,438
但是你只要掌握了母音…
but once you know the vowels...

464
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,565
你只要回答我的問題
Just answer the question.

465
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,193
你知道，我只是正在學他們的語言
I just had to learn how to pronounce it.

466
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:31,282
這種語言一千多年前就失傳了
It hasn't been a living, spoken language
in more than one thousand years.

467
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,408
你看這個,上面說:
Look at this. It says:

468
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:37,163
"一個來自遙遠星球的旅行者從一個即將毀滅的星球逃離
"A traveler from distant stars escaped from a dying world,

469
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,624
正尋找方法來延續他自己的生命"
"looking for a way to extend his own life.

470
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:44,003
他的身軀逐漸衰老，不可避免地面臨死亡…
"His body decaying and weak, he couldn't prevent his own demise."

471
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,173
很明顯地,他的種族也面臨滅亡 
Apparently his whole species was becoming extinct.

472
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,134
"因此他在銀河系中探索
"So he traveled or...

473
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:54,013
以求獲得永生的方法"
"searched the galaxies looking for a way to cheat death."

474
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:00,227
看這裡： "他來到了一個充滿生機的星球
Look here.  "He came to a world rich with life

475
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,730
在那裡遇到了一群原始種族
"where he encountered a primitive race.

476
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,690
人類！
"Humans.

477
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,693
一個他可以用自己的全部能力
"A species which, with all his powers and knowledge,

478
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,154
和知識來無限期維持的種族
"he could maintain indefinitely.

479
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:14,492
"他意識到, 只要進入人類的身體
他就有了重獲新生的機會"
"He realized within a human body he had a chance for a new life."

480
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,745
現在看來,  顯然他找到了一個年青人
Now, he apparently found a young boy.

481
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:22,625
上面說:"當驚恐的村民四散奔逃,黑夜變成了白晝的時候"
It says, "As the frightened villagers ran, night became day.

482
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:26,879
"他好奇且毫不害怕的向著亮光走過去"
"Curious and without fear, he walked towards the light."

483
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,803
Ra抓住了他並佔據了他的身體
Ra took him and possessed his body

484
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,473
就像是某種正尋找宿主的寄生生物一樣
like some kind of parasite looking for a host.

485
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,978
然後  利用這個人類的形體,他使自己成為了統治者
Then, inhabiting this human form, he appointed himself ruler.

486
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:48,108
他通過星際之門，將成千上萬的人帶到這裡
He used the Stargate to bring thousands of people to this planet

487
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,402
這些人成為採礦的苦力
as workers for the mines.

488
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,404
就是我們在外面看到的礦物
Just like the one we saw.

489
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,699
這種礦物是他的科技的基本材料
This mineral is clearly the building block of all his technology.

490
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,244
這種礦物可以使他獲得永恆的生命
With this, he can sustain eternal life.

491
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,373
後來地球上發生了變故…
Something happened back on Earth,

492
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,668
地球人起義，星際之門被埋葬在地底
a rebellion or uprising, and the Stargate was buried there.

493
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,464
為了防止這裡發生叛亂,太陽神禁止人們書寫和閱讀文字
Fearful of a rebellion here, Ra outlawed reading and writing.

494
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,801
他不希望人們記得事實真相
He didn't want people to remember the truth.

495
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:17,888
傑克森，你最好看一下這裡
Jackson, I think you'd better take a look at this.

496
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,148
就是這個，這就是我們要找的東西
That's it.
That's what we're looking for.

497
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:32,778
他們一定是把它藏在這裡,希望總有一天地球上的星際之門會被重新打開
They must have hidden it here hoping
the gate on Earth could be reopened.

498
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,365
我就知道他們一定有這東西…留存下來
I knew they'd have it written down someplace.

499
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,493
等一下.
Wait a minute.

500
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,537
第七個坐標呢？
Where's the seventh symbol?

501
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,289
一定是破碎了
It must've broken.

502
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,583
它一定是就在這裡的某處.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

503
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,634
符號被磨損了
It's worn off.

504
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,970
缺了這個，我就沒有辦法了
I can't make it work without the seventh symbol.

505
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,849
好了,  到此為止.
All right, that's it.

506
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,976
卡瓦斯基，布朗
Kawalsky. Brown.

507
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:19,033
快點跟上，傑克森
Come on, Jackson!

508
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:06,413
這是什麼鬼東西？
What the hell is that?

509
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:16,632
給，你可能需要這個
Here. You might need this.

510
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,046
當心！
Look out!

511
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,051
我們到哪裡去？
Where are we going?

512
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,638
為什麼要去星際之門？  我又不能開啟它！
Why are we going to the Stargate?
I can't make it work.

513
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,309
有從斜坡下來的東西，就開槍
Shoot anything that comes down that ramp.

514
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:52,853
你要幹什麼？你只要掩護我就好
- What are you doing?
- Just cover me.

515
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,529
這是什麼？
What is that?

516
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:06,867
-你在找什麼？ -它不見了．
- What are you looking for?
- It's gone.

517
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,319
放下槍，傑克森
Put it down, Jackson.

518
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,910
這是什麼？
What is that?

519
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,294
這是個炸彈，這就是你前面在找的東西？
It's a bomb, isn't it?
That's what you were looking for.

520
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,922
你他媽的到底在想些什麼？
What the hell were you thinking?

521
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,383
你到這裡來想幹什麼？
What did you come here for?

522
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,059
慢著！不要！
Wait! No!

523
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:05,040
上校，是我
Colonel! It's me.

524
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,876
你還好嗎？
You all right?

525
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,597
傑克森在哪裡？
Where's Jackson?

526
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,501
佛里曼
Freeman!

527
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:40,633
這邊! 快過來!
Over there! Come on!

528
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:42,760
卡瓦斯基
Kawalsky!

529
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:36,124
勝利萬歲！
To our victory!

530
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,754
我們回收了你們的武器
We recovered your weapons.

531
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,467
這裡,上校.
Here, Colonel.

532
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,098
那麼  你認為怎麼樣?
So, what do you think?

533
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:56,477
他們確實不是特種部隊,但他們渴望加入我們
They're not exactly Special Forces,
but they sure were eager to join up.

534
01:36:56,519 --> 01:37:00,731
在他們走火誤傷自己之前，先收起槍，中尉
Take these guns away, Lieutenant,
before they hurt themselves.

535
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,986
- 長官？　　　　　　　　　　　　
- 你聽見我說的話了把他們全送回家
- Sir?
- You heard me. Send them all home.

536
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:07,738
但他們現在無家可歸了
There's no place for these kids to go.

537
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:11,075
- 不管怎樣，還能幫助我們做什麼？
- 幫什麼？
- Anyway, we could use their help.
- For what?

538
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,538
去做什麼？
To do what?

539
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:29,635
為什麼剛才你不告訴他們？
Why don't you just tell them everything?

540
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:33,347
為什麼你不告訴他們核彈的事
Why don't you tell them about the bomb?

541
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:36,392
他說的是怎麼回事？
What's he talking about?

542
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:42,523
給我的命令很簡單
My orders were simple.

543
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:48,905
找出任何的有可能的危險跡象
Track down signs of any possible danger,

544
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:52,074
如果我發現了, 就炸毀星際之門
and if I found any, blow up the Stargate.

545
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:54,202
然而  我發現有危險了
Well, I found some.

546
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,995
那你的炸彈現在落在對方手裡了
Your bomb is his now.

547
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:58,873
明天他就要把炸彈傳送到地球去
And tomorrow he's gonna send it back to Earth,

548
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,500
與一整批他們在這裡開採的礦物一起
along with that mineral they mine here.

549
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:04,462
這樣當它爆炸時  就會導致比這核彈
When that thing goes off, it'll cause an explosion

550
01:38:04,503 --> 01:38:08,007
單獨爆炸時的威力激增100倍的破壞性
a hundred times more destructive
than that bomb alone was capable of.

551
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:12,762
我會在他把核彈送回去之前使核彈失效的
I'll intercept that bomb before he can send it through.

552
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:16,933
-之前為什麼沒人告訴我？
-因為沒有任何理由要告訴你們,卡瓦斯基.
- Why wasn't I told of this?
- There was no reason to tell you.

553
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:21,729
-你們甚至不應該還在這裡
-你們應該早就和丹尼爾一起回地球了
You weren't even supposed to be here.
You were all gonna go back with Daniel.

554
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:25,483
我將獨自留下來炸毀星際之門,而那正好是我將要做的
I was gonna stay behind and blow up the Stargate, and that's what I'm gonna do.

555
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:29,904
引起威脅的是地球那邊的星門.  我們必須要關閉的是那個才對
The gate on Earth is the threat.  That's the one we have to shut down.

556
01:38:29,946 --> 01:38:32,323
你說得非常對，
You're absolutely right.

557
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:35,409
但就因為你不知道怎麼回去
But since you don't know how to get us back,

558
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:38,162
我們這才沒有其他選擇了，不是嗎？
we don't have that option, do we?

559
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:42,351
你真的能接受這個事實:
不管發生什麼事你都不回家嗎?
You accepted the fact that, no matter what, you would not be going home?

560
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:48,482
你難道沒有牽掛的人嗎？
Don't you have people who care about you?

561
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,651
你有家人嗎？
Do you have a family?

562
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,070
我曾經有個家
I had a family.

563
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:59,660
沒人能承受自己的孩子比自己先離開人世
No one should ever have to outlive their own child.

564
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,205
我不想死.  
I don't want to die.

565
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,082
你的部下也不想死
Your men don't want to die.

566
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:08,085
這裡的人也都不想死
And these people here don't want to die.

567
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:11,589
你難道不該為你現在這個樣子感到羞愧嗎？
It's a shame you're in such a hurry to.

568
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:01,824
丈夫？
Husband?

569
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:01,318
把月亮連起來…
Connect the moons.

570
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:08,701
這是這個星球的符號.  就是它.
This is the symbol for this planet.
That's it

571
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,913
起點！
The point of origin.

572
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,918
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

573
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:20,045
我找到了！
I found it.

574
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:23,591
- 你在說什麼啊？   - 第七個坐標　
- What are you talking about?
- The seventh symbol.

575
01:44:25,467 --> 01:44:27,094
我們可以回家了
We're going home.

576
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,872
我們走
Let's go.

577
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,955
那裡出了什麼事？
What's happening up there?

578
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:26,857
你還好嗎？
How you doin'?

579
01:47:39,828 --> 01:47:42,206
媽的！快上，弗雷迪！
Damn! Come on, Feretti!

580
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,551
快！
Come on!

581
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:26,750
嘿！你還好嗎？
You OK?   You all right?

582
01:48:33,465 --> 01:48:35,092
散開！
Spread out!

583
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,600
我們走！
Let's go!

584
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:50,232
我們死定了！ 不要這麼說！
- We're dead!
- Quit talking like that.

585
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:52,526
-我們現在怎麼做？  - 掩護我　
- What are we gonna do?
- Cover me.

586
01:48:53,151 --> 01:48:54,820
掩護你？
Cover you?

587
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:56,822
卡瓦斯基！
Kawalsky!

588
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:09,918
弗雷迪，幫我把這些東西翻過去
Help me push this thing over!

589
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:47,956
-你在做什麼？ -完成這次任務
- What are you doing?
- Completing this mission.

590
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:51,043
我們不是說好在地球那邊拆除這扇門嗎？
We agreed to dismantle the gate on Earth.

591
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:53,295
你會做到的
And you will.

592
01:49:53,337 --> 01:49:55,505
從現在起，那是你的工作了
That's your job now.

593
01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:58,425
我要留在這裡，確認門已經被毀了
I'm gonna stay here and make sure this goes off.

594
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,186
你還有7分鐘的時間
You got seven minutes.

595
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:03,490
你做什麼？
What are you doing?

596
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:06,618
傑克森！
Jackson.

597
01:51:06,702 --> 01:51:08,245
等著我
Wait for me.

598
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:18,500
- 你還有多少子彈，弗雷迪！
- 我們都用完彈藥了！
- You got any rounds at all, Feretti?
- We're all out of ammo!

599
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:20,544
來了！　　趴下！
Incoming!

600
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:52,117
卡瓦斯基，我們必須想點辦法
Kawalsky, we gotta do something.

601
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,792
停火！
Stop! Hey!

602
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:35,845
請代我向你的 Tut國王致敬,  混蛋
Give my regards to King Tut, asshole.

603
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:58,089
- 我們還剩下多少時間？
- ４５秒　
- How much time do we have left?  - 45 seconds.

604
01:58:58,173 --> 01:59:02,177
- 敵人已經逃跑，快關了這個
- 我也想，我無法解除它．
- He's leaving. Turn it off.
- I'm trying to. I can't disarm it.

605
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,386
啥?
What?

606
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:06,389
我不能停止炸彈，他們把炸彈改裝了
I can't stop it.  They got it rigged.

607
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:22,822
我有個主意
I've got an idea.

608
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:49,552
- 我就知道你會有辦法帶我們回去的
- 是這樣嗎？
- I always knew you'd get us back.   - Yeah, right.

609
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,137
回頭見
Later.

610
02:01:52,764 --> 02:01:54,682
謝謝，丹尼爾
Thanks, Daniel.

611
02:02:02,899 --> 02:02:06,444
-你確定你要這麼做？
-是的,我肯定
- You sure you want to do this?
- Yes, I'm sure.

612
02:02:07,779 --> 02:02:10,740
不會有事吧？？
You gonna be all right?

613
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,744
我肯定不會有事
I'm gonna be all right.

614
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:17,580
那你呢？
How about you?

615
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,168
是的
Yeah.

616
02:02:24,837 --> 02:02:26,923
不會有事，我想是的
Yeah, I think so.

617
02:02:34,263 --> 02:02:36,891
告訴凱薩琳，這東西給我帶來了好運
Tell Catherine this brought me luck.

618
02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:42,772
我會的
I will.

619
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,987
我會再來看望大家的
I'll be seeing you around...

620
02:02:51,572 --> 02:02:53,241
傑克森博士！
Dr. Jackson.
