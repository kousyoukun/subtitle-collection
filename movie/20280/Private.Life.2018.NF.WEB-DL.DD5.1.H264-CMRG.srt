1
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,314
Scoot over.

2
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,191
Okay.

3
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,740
All right.

4
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,589
You ready?

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,051
All right, wait...

6
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,471
Okay.

7
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,848
Just keep breathing, okay?

8
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,560
-You breathing?
-Yes, just go!

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,103
All right. One...

10
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,313
two...

11
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,440
-three. What?
-Fuck!

12
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,984
-Oh, my God, Richard!
-Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,028
-It really fucking hurts.
-I'm sorry. Okay.

14
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,239
-Oh, God!
-Almost done, almost done.

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,366
Almost done.

16
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,702
Done.

17
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,915
I think you hit a nerve.

18
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,002
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I did exactly
what the nurse told me to do.

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,296
Wasn't it supposed be
more like right here?

20
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,090
No, it's the upper-outer quadrant.

21
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,674
Then why did it hurt like that?

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,344
None of the message boards said
it was gonna hurt like that.

23
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,428
I-I don't know, Rach.

24
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,682
It's a bigger needle. Maybe you have
a lower pain threshold than most people.

25
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,642
I don't know.

26
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,770
I am not a doctor, remember?

27
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,568
Are you mad at me?

28
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,198
No.

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm not mad, I'm just...

30
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,494
Whatever. I don't know.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,204
Tired.

32
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,301
These are your consent forms.

33
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,636
Both partners' signatures are required
on the second page.

34
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,890
This is our policy regarding
embryo storage,

35
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,558
these schedules on the back.

36
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,144
You both need to initial each paragraph,

37
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,396
-then sign here.
-Very good. Thank you.

38
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,941
-And this is for you.
-Oh. This--

39
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,610
-Instructions are inside.
-Good.

40
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,945
-Ah, there you are.
-Hey! What's wrong?

41
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,072
Nothing,
it's just fucking freezing in here.

42
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,700
Just... relax. Don't obsess, all right?

43
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,202
I'm not obsessing. I'm cold.

44
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,292
Okay. You need to sign these.

45
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,461
Oh, my God, what are we doing?

46
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,715
-Are we really doing this? Are we insane?
-No, we're not insane. We're normal.

47
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,468
This is not normal.
This is the opposite of normal.

48
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,262
I'm not sure it's even ethical.

49
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,805
-Remember what Marty said?
-Ugh.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,725
"Having a baby is an immoral act."

51
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,809
Marty's an idiot.

52
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,229
"Overpopulation, climate change...

53
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,357
rise of neo-fascism."

54
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,985
-Did you take your Valium?
-Yes, why?

55
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,072
Ms. Biegler?

56
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,159
-One sec. Okay.
-Okay.

57
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,620
Okay, I guess we're really doing this.

58
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,622
-Don't be scared, okay?
-Okay.

59
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,416
You're gonna do great.
All we need is one good egg.

60
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,752
Okay. You, too.

61
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,463
Don't be scared, you're gonna do great.

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,632
-Okay, I love you.
-I love you, too.

63
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,392
Ah!

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,688
Fuck! Oh, my God, your dick feels
so good inside of me!

65
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,731
Ah... Ah!

66
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,026
Ah, yeah, fuck me like a fucking whore!

67
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,611
Fuck me like a whore!

68
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,615
Yeah, I wanna feel the head of your cock
deep inside of me!

69
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,367
Yeah, give it to me!

70
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,410
Oh...

71
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,162
Fuck! Oh, God!

72
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,664
Yes! Yes!

73
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,999
Oh...

74
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,294
Fuck! Yes! God!

75
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,840
Fuck, yeah!
I like it when you squeeze my ass!

76
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,551
You like my fucking ass?

77
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,760
Yeah!

78
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,596
Tell me, how does that feel?

79
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,640
Wanna fuck me like a little whore?

80
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,850
Yes? Huh?

81
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,687
My eight-year-old came to work one day
to see what I do.

82
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,189
You know,
"Take Your Daughter To Work Day."

83
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,358
Well...

84
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:23,323
she said I had the most boring job
in the world.

85
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,326
All I do all day...

86
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,995
is put people to sleep.

87
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,498
Excuse me, ma'am?

88
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,249
Nurse?

89
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,462
Where's my husband?

90
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,297
Your birth partner never joined you?

91
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,800
He's my husband.

92
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,094
-Excuse me--
-My birth partner, he's my husband.

93
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,470
Mr. Grim?

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,472
Grimes. Yes, Richard Grimes.

95
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,350
You're gonna need to speak
to a doctor. Let me go find someone.

96
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,726
-Is something wrong?
-Just a moment.

97
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,353
Why can't you just tell me?

98
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,230
Hello?

99
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,440
Fuck!

100
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,946
There wasn't any sperm.

101
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,699
Excuse me?

102
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,369
Your husband didn't have any sperm.

103
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,541
Wait, you mean he couldn't...

104
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
do it?

105
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,715
No, he produced,
and there was semen, but no sperm.

106
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,677
Dr. Dordick will have to give you
the details.

107
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,441
Think of it like a soda machine.

108
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,985
Either one of you ever work
in a movie theater?

109
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,822
So, the seltzer comes from one place,

110
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,450
the syrup comes from someplace else,

111
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,620
and, together, they make Mountain Dew,
or Diet Coke, or what have you.

112
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,957
But, if the pipe gets clogged,

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,626
you don't get Mountain Dew.

114
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,003
You just get seltzer.

115
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,131
Richard is probably blocked.

116
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,176
Like mentally? Like psychosomatic?

117
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,845
No, not mentally. Physically.

118
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,389
-Like the talk about the soda machine.
-Right, sorry.

119
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,933
Yeah. So, I just got off the phone
with a buddy of mine.

120
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,102
He's a urologist, he's an expert on this.

121
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,813
In fact, he's writing a book about it.
Joel Fisher.

122
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,442
Oh, my God. That is so depressing.

123
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,943
It's not depressing, Rich.

124
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,820
Based on everything we've talked about,

125
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,240
he's convinced you've got sperm in there.
The trick is we gotta get it out.

126
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,326
-Okay.
-Now, there's a procedure for this,

127
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,536
and Joel's definitely the man for the job.

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,246
It's called TESE.

129
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,832
Testicular Sperm Extraction.

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,335
Oh, my God.

131
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,669
Not as bad as it sounds.

132
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,339
You know he only has one testicle, right?

133
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:27,924
What?

134
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,592
He needs to know.

135
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
Yeah, I realize that.

136
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,097
I only have one testicle.

137
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,183
-Yeah, I saw the note in your file.
-Okay.

138
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,476
I filled Fisher in.

139
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,770
He doesn't anticipate it being a problem.

140
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,982
What he'll do is avoid the vas,
and go right to the source,

141
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,776
doing a testicular biopsy.

142
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,612
-Like for cancer?
-No, Rach, not cancer.

143
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,572
I don't have cancer. I have blocked sperm.

144
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,032
Sorry, he said biopsy.

145
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,202
The thing is, if we do TESE,

146
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,247
then we're gonna have to do ICSI.

147
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,416
It's Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection.

148
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,044
It's an additional expense,
but that actually can't be helped.

149
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,172
The good news is Fisher is available.

150
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,049
Happens to be in the city today.

151
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,386
Bad news is he'll need a check
for $10,000.

152
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,389
I know, it's... short notice.

153
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,558
-Not a problem.
-Ah.

154
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,310
-It's not?
-No.

155
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,563
Okay, well, take a minute.

156
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,981
Talk things over.

157
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,316
When you're ready,
I will give Fisher a call.

158
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,777
Meanwhile, Moira can get you suited up,

159
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,281
and we're off to the races. Yeah, boom!

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,199
Okay.

161
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,956
Richard, we don't have $10,000.

162
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,624
I know. I'm gonna call Charlie.

163
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,793
I thought we weren't gonna tell anybody.

164
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,254
I know, but what are we
supposed to do, Rach?

165
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,048
-My God.
-Eleven of your eggs are sitting in here

166
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,676
and we don't have anything
to inseminate them with.

167
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,012
So if I don't call him, we're screwed.

168
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,847
The cycle will have been a bust,

169
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,183
and we will have blown through a big chunk
of our baby budget for nothing.

170
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,697
That's great, no, that's fine, it's no...

171
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,743
If you're gonna be here within the...
Yeah, okay, good. All right.

172
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,870
I'll see you soon. Bye.

173
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,165
-He's on his way with a check.
-He is?

174
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,667
-Yep!
-Did Cynthia say anything?

175
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,419
What? No, of course not.

176
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,087
-She's so judgmental.
-No, she's not.

177
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,965
Yes, she is.
She was even weird when we were doing IUI.

178
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,971
-They're doing it again?
-No, this is something totally different.

179
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,266
New doctor, very high-tech. It's got...

180
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,895
egg harvesting, hatching...
something called "icksy."

181
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,148
You seen my pants?

182
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,859
I thought they were done with that
and were trying to adopt.

183
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,236
They're still doing that.
But after that thing with that girl,

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,447
they're trying
a by-any-means-necessary approach,

185
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,449
-doing both at once.
-Oh, my God.

186
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,992
They're like impulsive gamblers.

187
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,703
Anyway, it's very technical
and it's hard to keep track of,

188
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,040
but there's a problem with Richard's sperm
and he needs to borrow $10,000,

189
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,083
like, now.

190
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,417
You're not gonna give it to him?

191
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,418
-Oh, yeah.
-What?

192
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,003
-Charlie!
-They'll pay me back.

193
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,089
Giving them money is just enabling them!

194
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,677
-To do what?
-To pursue this fantasy of fertility,

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,887
when it's pretty clear
that it's consuming them.

196
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,597
They are strung out.

197
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,184
Their marriage is a wreck,
they're always fighting.

198
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,977
They're like fertility junkies!

199
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,396
That's nuts.

200
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh, come on.
They've been doing this for years!

201
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,025
They need to stop. They need to move on.

202
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,320
Mom! Sadie's on the phone.
She doesn't sound good.

203
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,781
-My goodness! Hi, honey.
-I really need to get going.

204
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,617
Yeah-- I really want you to think about
what you're doing!

205
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,536
Mom, what's going on?

206
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,122
Nothing. It's just,
Charlie is going into the city--

207
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,958
I'm gonna pick up some stuff
at Russ &amp; Daughters. You want salmon?

208
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,043
Hey, Charlotte, do you want salmon?

209
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,002
What?

210
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,006
Do you-- Dad is going into Manhattan.
You want Russ &amp; Daughters?

211
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,175
Bialy and an everything bagel.

212
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,010
Bialy and an everything bagel,

213
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,929
and get me a half a pound of wild--

214
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,765
No! Get me a half... quarter pound
of wild nova!

215
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,852
Hi, honey. So sorry about that.
Is everything okay?

216
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,770
Not really.

217
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,272
What's wrong?

218
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,817
Are you smoking?

219
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,652
No, I quit. I told you.

220
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,906
I'm just-- I've got a cold and it's--

221
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,950
I'm standing outside and it's freezing.

222
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,535
You sound funny.

223
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,747
I'm not doing well.

224
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,999
Are you failing?

225
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,835
No, not-- God, Mom. Not--

226
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,797
Emotionally, not academically.
God, you're so achievement-oriented.

227
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,009
Finishing college at 25 isn't exactly
an achievement, Sadie.

228
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,510
It's damage control.

229
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,514
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

230
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,476
-It's what you think.
-No, it's not what I think.

231
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,353
I just want you to find something
that you love doing,

232
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,231
that will, you know,
give your life meaning and purpose.

233
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,149
I found it.

234
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,275
Remember?

235
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,861
Writing?

236
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,322
Right. Yes.

237
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,782
And you're so good at it,

238
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,702
but if you want to be a writer writer,
like professional,

239
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,704
you have to be driven and disciplined.

240
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,290
If you're having trouble with that now,
imagine how hard it's gonna be

241
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,375
in real life when you have
to pay rent at the same time.

242
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,754
I'm not failing, Mom! I did good work
at the beginning of this semester

243
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,340
that I'm really proud of. I'm just...

244
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,301
I'm stuck right now,

245
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,387
and I'm not gonna be ready to hand in
my portfolio in writing workshop,

246
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,432
which is like 80 per cent of my grade,
but I've got this great professor

247
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,810
who really believes in me,
and the good news is

248
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,647
she's gonna give me an "incomplete,"
which is really great, because...

249
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,775
Sadie?

250
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,570
I'm just waiting for you to tell me
that in the real world,

251
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,447
there's no such thing as an "incomplete."

252
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,953
Honey, why don't you come home
and we can talk about this in person?

253
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,581
-I can't come home, Mom.
-Why not?

254
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,254
Because... I wanna be in the city.

255
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,507
Oh, my God, Sadie.
How are you gonna do that?

256
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,010
I'll work, I'll waitress. It's not gonna
cost you a penny, I promise.

257
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,514
Uncle Richard and Aunt Rachel said I could
stay at their place anytime--

258
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,432
Richard and Rachel have a lot
on their plate.

259
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,353
They're not in any position to take care
of anyone but themselves right now.

260
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,588
Say goodnight to everyone.

261
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,423
Say goodnight!

262
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,258
-Goodnight!
-Goodnight!

263
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,053
On Monday and Thursday,
they clean the north side of the street.

264
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,306
On Tuesday and Friday,
they clean the south side of the street.

265
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,893
On the weekends, they don't do anything.
I don't see what the problem is

266
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,771
about alternate-side parking.
I mean, people get so, like,

267
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,439
"What are you gonna do with the car?"

268
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,068
It's all just party people drinking
themselves sick on the weekends.

269
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,194
-For real?
-Yes.

270
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,906
I can barely walk the dogs at night.

271
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,240
Oh, man.

272
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,495
I just don't wanna find myself at 50
in some block association meeting

273
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,622
trying to prevent the opening
of a new bar.

274
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,790
Richard...

275
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,167
we're not turning 50 on East 6th Street.

276
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,462
I'm 47.

277
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,882
When's your book coming out?

278
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,469
-April.
-Oh, that's exciting!

279
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,098
I haven't written jack-shit
since Talia was born.

280
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,393
Okay, you've got to try this,
I'm obsessed.

281
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,854
-I drank it all summer.
-Oh... No, thank you.

282
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,108
Really? It's Prosecco.
Not a Prosecco person?

283
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,151
No, I am, I love it. I just...

284
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,195
I can't.

285
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,197
I'm cycling.

286
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,949
Oh, my God, SoulCycle?

287
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,953
My sister does that and her ass is like
two little coconuts. Do you love it?

288
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,373
Yeah, no,
not that kind of cycling. It's...

289
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,418
IVF.

290
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,296
Oh, my God.

291
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,300
-I'm so sorry. What an idiot!
-No!

292
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,302
Why would-- That's okay.

293
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,014
No, it's not! I'm such a dope.

294
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,598
Wow!

295
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,437
I didn't know you two were back to that.
I thought you were just trying to adopt.

296
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,649
No, yeah, we are. We just figured
while we're waiting we might as well

297
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,692
give this a shot.

298
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,027
Ha!

299
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,528
Sorry, that's a good one.

300
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,155
Giving IVF "a shot."

301
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,953
It's our first time. We've done a lot of
IUIs before, but we've never really...

302
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,621
brought out the big guns.

303
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,291
I'm sure it'll really increase
your chances though, right?

304
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,502
Yeah, I don't know...

305
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,630
Our numbers aren't that great.

306
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,341
You should talk to my cousin, Erin.

307
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,510
-Yeah?
-She did IVF to get her kids.

308
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,473
The doctors told her she shouldn't bother.
Her chances were one percent or something.

309
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,932
And she got pregnant twice.

310
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,186
In her 40s. With only one ovary.

311
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,395
Wow.

312
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,065
I'm sure she'd be happy to talk to you
about it. And her kids...

313
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,026
are amazing. Look at them.

314
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,611
-Oh...
-How cute!

315
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,071
Right?

316
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,535
That's a double-A embryo right there.

317
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,579
See the tightly-packed cells?

318
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,623
That puppy's raring to go.

319
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,918
I'm gonna transfer both,
but I'm putting my money on that guy.

320
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,837
You ready?

321
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,757
All righty...

322
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,884
Here we go, guys! Showtime!

323
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,680
Now your job is just to relax
and breathe, okay?

324
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,183
This might be a little cold.

325
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,229
Just... relax.

326
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,690
That's it.

327
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,613
You like prog rock?

328
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,199
No.

329
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,100
All right. Let's get pregnant, shall we?

330
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,657
Oh, here. Let's grab that one.

331
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,076
Oh, my God! Wait! Richard! Get it!

332
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,411
-Oh!
-Richard!

333
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,413
-Ho, ho, ho!
-Jesus Christ!

334
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,848
Excuse me, excuse me. Hi!

335
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,558
-Could you open your--
-It's fine, sweetheart.

336
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,476
No, it's not. I'm trying to implant.

337
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,855
Sir, could you please open up your thing?
Could you open that up?

338
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,064
Hi!

339
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,318
Hi, I just had a medical procedure--

340
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,529
It's gynecological.

341
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,617
If you could just slow down and go easy
on the bumps, I'd really appreciate it.

342
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,500
-How we doing?
-Good!

343
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,211
Okay.

344
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,216
As of now...

345
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,178
-there are no IVF materials in sight.
-Great.

346
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,764
Ugh...

347
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,309
Hey, you think we should
take down the Lisa Yuskavage?

348
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,103
What? No!

349
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,356
I'm just looking at it
from Beth's perspective.

350
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,149
We're used to it, but...

351
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,151
if we sit next to each other on the couch

352
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,862
and Beth sits across from us,
it's right in her face.

353
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,988
What is?

354
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,281
The vagina.

355
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,453
I think we should at least move it
so it's not so...

356
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,372
central.

357
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,875
No. No.

358
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,463
If our social worker's so uptight that she
would deny us a child because we have...

359
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,883
a vagina on our wall,
well, then it's, like...

360
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,510
screw everything!

361
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,804
No!

362
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,016
I mean, you know, it's, like, fuck it!
Just fuck the whole fucking thing!

363
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,768
-Okay.
-So sick of people judging us,

364
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,478
telling us what to do all the time.

365
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,398
Between the doctors, the social workers,
and the support groups,

366
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,400
it's like, you know what,
shut the fuck up already!

367
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,151
Shove it up your fucking asses!

368
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,574
So, before Kyra went on maternity leave,

369
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,244
she walked me through everything,
so I'm pretty up to date.

370
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,829
-Okay.
-But...

371
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,915
there's really nothing that can replace
the face-to-face.

372
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,209
-Yes.
-Oops. Hope it's not too hot.

373
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,127
Thank you.

374
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,962
-You want any?
-No, I'm good.

375
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,261
Yeah, she's a good friend of ours.

376
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,764
Not the woman in the picture,
the artist who made it.

377
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,224
She's a friend.

378
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,476
-It was a wedding present.
-Yeah, so...

379
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,774
So, it looks like you came to adoption
after some fertility treatments.

380
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,694
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,115
Well, it wasn't for us.
Just didn't feel right.

382
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,785
Plus, Richard only has one testicle, so...

383
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,168
And I see that you were matched
with a birth mother last winter.

384
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,254
Would you mind telling me
a little bit about that?

385
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,215
Yeah.

386
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,634
Okay...

387
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,975
Well, we had been officially waiting
for a couple of months,

388
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,769
and we weren't getting any calls,

389
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,771
-which was totally depressing.
-Yeah.

390
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,816
-Kyra told us about Parent Portraits...
-Yeah.

391
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,444
...and so we decided to give it a try.

392
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,572
About a week after our page went up,

393
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,740
-we got a call.
-Yeah.

394
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,828
Fuck!

395
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,789
Hello?

396
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,834
Yes, hi. Yeah, that's us.

397
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,172
No, we're so happy that you called.
It's the perfect time.

398
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,510
Yes, that's right. New York City. NYC.

399
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,014
Well, it's got pros and cons,
but we love it.

400
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,308
So where are you from?

401
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,977
Wow. Really?

402
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,147
Birthplace of Bill Clinton.

403
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,528
No, we've never been there,
but that's somewhere we've always...

404
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,862
we've always wanted to go to.

405
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,408
No, we were just watching TV.

406
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,452
Yes, exactly, the city that never sleeps.

407
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,538
We talked almost every night for a month.

408
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,706
"He's so weird, so scrawny,"
and he was like--

409
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah, he like asked me out
for ice cream or something.

410
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,423
I don't know, whatever you do in 6th Grade
and I was like, "No..."

411
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,883
I guess it was, yeah,
freshman year of high school.

412
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,762
He asked me out again. He was relentless.

413
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,934
We just fell in love with her.

414
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,062
What's the story with that thing?

415
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,649
She was so young, it was almost like
we were her parents.

416
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,733
No?

417
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,695
-The doctor's appointment went so well!
-Okay!

418
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,698
The only thing I did before
I got on, was...

419
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,783
Oh!

420
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,994
-Oh, that is so sweet!
-Very nice!

421
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,580
They said that the heartbeat is great.

422
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,248
The blood work...

423
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:24,087
um, they did the whole sonogram thing,
and I guess it's growing at the right...

424
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,714
speed, so--

425
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,146
-And so you arranged to meet with her?
-Yeah.

426
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,147
-Okay.
-Yup.

427
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,983
Two days before Christmas.

428
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,612
It's amazing we could get tickets.

429
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,741
Yep. There she blows.

430
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:13,803
-Okay! We got barbecue ribs and iced tea.
-Wow! That looks great, thank you.

431
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,932
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can get for you?

432
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,183
No. Thank you.

433
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,726
-All right. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

434
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,447
Rach, relax.

435
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,698
She's just late.

436
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,327
Come on. Have some mashed potatoes.

437
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,177
After that it was just like...

438
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:55,971
poof.

439
00:25:59,057 --> 00:25:59,933
She never...

440
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,103
showed up and we never heard
from her again.

441
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,489
We'd been warned about this stuff.

442
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,202
But, it's not like she asked us for money
or anything.

443
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,882
And when we got home,

444
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,637
we realized that there was no name or date
on any of the sonograms.

445
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,312
Kyra said that sometimes
the girls just want the attention.

446
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,231
And there isn't a baby at all.

447
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,322
We still don't know if she was...

448
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,823
real or not.

449
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,248
You know, it's much easier
when it involves money.

450
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,876
At least that makes some kind of sense.

451
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,088
But the emotional scams are just really...

452
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,049
really tough.

453
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,971
I mean, most people that've been through
what you've been through,

454
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,222
they would've given up.

455
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,143
Or they would have thrown themselves
right back on the fertility treadmill.

456
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,357
It really is a testament
to your strength as a couple

457
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,025
that you stuck with it

458
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,653
and renewed your commitment to adoption.

459
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,574
Thank you.

460
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,433
Hey, Eno! Lazlo!

461
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,743
Rich?

462
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,829
A text from Rachel.

463
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,497
What does it say?

464
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,127
It's kind of personal.

465
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,510
Thanks.

466
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,310
We're rooting for you.

467
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,328
Rach?

468
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,806
Yeah, hello?

469
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,354
Yes. Sure, just hold on just a second.

470
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,647
Rach!

471
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,026
Hey. It's Dordick.

472
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,006
You could give it another go.

473
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,093
This was your first IVF,
Rachel responded well.

474
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,011
All it takes is one good egg.

475
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,224
On the other hand...

476
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,477
the two of you have been at it
for quite some time,

477
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,938
and if money is a factor...

478
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,817
that, combined with Rachel's age,
makes me think...

479
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:07,156
sure, you could try again, but your best
chance for success is with a donor egg.

480
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,953
Yeah. It's a big leap, I know.

481
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,080
It takes some getting used to.

482
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:18,084
And I don't want to diminish
the loss of a genetic link for Rachel.

483
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,754
But there are a lot of positives
to consider.

484
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,134
Rachel would carry the child,
she'd control the prenatal environment,

485
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,553
give birth.

486
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:29,929
Breastfeed.

487
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,933
And, of course, there'd be
Richard's genetic contribution.

488
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,522
It's a lot to wrap your head around.

489
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,774
Give it some time.

490
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,487
Meanwhile, take a look at our program,

491
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,282
see what you think,
and we can talk next week.

492
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,748
Well, he's out of his fucking mind.

493
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,708
No way in hell I'm doing that.

494
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,252
We should at least just think about it.

495
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,297
I'm not saying that we would do it.

496
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,216
We can just explore the idea,
see how we feel.

497
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,886
Make a list of all the pros and cons.

498
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,517
We talked about this.
We swore we would never do it.

499
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,228
No, you swore that you would
never do it. I...

500
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,400
I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want
to pressure you into something

501
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,986
that you were gonna have to live with
for the rest of your life.

502
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,325
Wait, so all this time I'm assuming
that we feel the same way about this,

503
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,370
you've been having secret fantasies
about egg donation?

504
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,871
It's not a secret fantasy.

505
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,458
It is to me. I didn't know about it.
I thought that we had decided,

506
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,001
together as a couple,

507
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,295
that we would definitely
draw the line at...

508
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,838
science fiction!

509
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,715
It's not science fiction, Rach.

510
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,511
It's pretty primitive, actually.
They do it with farm animals all the time.

511
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,429
Well, I'm not a goat!

512
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,682
-Okay?
-Bad example. I'm sorry.

513
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,266
Oh, my God!

514
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,687
You're, like, so gung-ho right now,
it's freaking me out.

515
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,690
I am not gung-ho, I am just pragmatic.

516
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:08,528
If we do another IVF with your eggs, we've
got a four per cent chance of pregnancy?

517
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,657
With a donor egg, we'd be going
from four to, like, 65 per cent!

518
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,119
The gambler in me just wants to put
my money on the better odds.

519
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,328
Oh, my God!

520
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,497
You're Guy Woodhouse.

521
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
What?

522
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,585
The husband in Rosemary's Baby,
John Cassavetes, that's you.

523
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,004
Yeah, Rach. That's me,

524
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,798
standing by while you're raped
by a satanic demon.

525
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:33,136
I am just suggesting that we listen to
our doctor and look into all the options.

526
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,680
We're already signed up for adoption.
What is the big deal?

527
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,975
Well, for one, I'm not putting
someone else's body parts

528
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,976
into my uterus.

529
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,603
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me. Sorry.

530
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,941
I know it's more complicated for you.

531
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,404
-Isn't it more complicated for you, too?
-Yes, of course it is. Yes, yes.

532
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,240
But you heard him.

533
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,117
There's a lot of positives.

534
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,786
-You would get to carry the baby.
-Whoop-de-doo!

535
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,039
What does that make me, the bellhop?

536
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,125
No.

537
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,297
Why don't you just go screw
a younger woman, then?

538
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,966
-What are you talking about?
-Look!

539
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,052
There's one now. Go fuck her!

540
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,637
I don't want to fuck her!

541
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,557
My God, look, we are doing
everything we can,

542
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,977
short of kidnapping, to start a family.
I do not know why

543
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,645
this is so off-limits.

544
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,231
That's easy for you to say.
You'll have your...

545
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,859
genetic contribution, and me, I'm just...

546
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,195
I'll just be...

547
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,032
What?

548
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,245
Left out.

549
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,752
Don't even--

550
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,630
Just don't.

551
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,393
Oh...

552
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,190
Who is it?

553
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,070
It's the kids from the third floor.

554
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,573
What do they want?

555
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,575
Candy.

556
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,118
It's Halloween.

557
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,245
Shit.

558
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,915
Just don't answer it.

559
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,924
Someone's there. I heard them.

560
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,135
But they're not answering.

561
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,889
-But it's a holiday.
-It's not that kind of holiday.

562
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,724
Not everybody celebrates Halloween.

563
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,685
They did it last year.

564
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,108
-Trick or Treat!
-Trick or Treat!

565
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,884
Jesus, it's like eBay for ova.

566
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:07,600
There's one that got
a full athletic scholarship in golf.

567
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,938
I mean, have you ever even heard of that?
College golf?

568
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,398
I thought you were working on your edit.

569
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,277
So what do you think?

570
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,615
-What?
-For her to have your baby.

571
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,035
She's not having my baby. You are.

572
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,248
Okay, fine. Well, just, what do you think?

573
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,377
I think she's fine.

574
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,464
-That's all you're gonna say?
-I'm not making a big thing out of this.

575
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,299
It's just an egg.

576
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,717
It's one cell.

577
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,930
One cell that would contain half
the chromosomes of our child-to-be.

578
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,267
-I don't see it that way.
-You are so in denial. It's crazy.

579
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,935
You know what? Don't knock denial.

580
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,188
It comes in very handy,
you should try it sometime.

581
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,524
'Cause without it,
you end up like this guy.

582
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,946
Listen to this.

583
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,533
Double major,
Philosophy and Political Science,

584
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:09,287
at an East Coast Ivy League university.
Entered at age 16.

585
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,289
Too intimidating.

586
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,001
Yeah. Your sperm might be
a little shy around her eggs.

587
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,755
Favorite book, The Fountainhead?

588
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,634
See, she's got an asterisk.
That means she's reserved.

589
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,721
She probably has a waiting list.
It's that Ivy League thing.

590
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,267
Hm. Hm. Whoa, whoa.

591
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,728
Click on her.

592
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,563
She's cute.

593
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,491
She's got a BA in Journalism
and Cinema Studies.

594
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,953
No wonder she's selling her eggs.
She can't get a job.

595
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,042
I like her nose.

596
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,920
I like your nose.

597
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,843
This is actually kinda kinky, isn't it?

598
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,636
I find it kind of...

599
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,680
kind of kinky.

600
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,058
Hm?

601
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,393
Oh, my God.

602
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,397
Richard.

603
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,236
Wait. Is that...

604
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,365
Er... Fiona from Mogador?

605
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:32,912
Whoa.

606
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,466
This is weird.

607
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,303
Just think of it as an exercise.
There's no right or wrong answers.

608
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,138
-All right.
-Okay?

609
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,139
Yeah. All right.

610
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,017
Fine.

611
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,606
Well, you know, she's beautiful.
That's obvious.

612
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,152
She's always nice, which is good,
whenever we come in.

613
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,322
No matter how crowded.

614
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,535
She's got a great laugh.

615
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,621
Amazing body.

616
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,833
In summer, when she wears those...

617
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,378
thin cotton dresses,
with her hair all piled up--

618
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,838
Oh, my God.

619
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,464
What?

620
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,136
You said there were no wrong answers.

621
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,222
It's very confusing.
I've never done this before.

622
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,976
Neither have I, but just...
stop thinking about fucking her.

623
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:37,977
Okay?

624
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,522
Think about her like she's your daughter,
not your...

625
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,482
girlfriend.

626
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,402
You wanted to do this, you know.

627
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,987
You think I enjoy this?

628
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,450
Looking for another woman's egg
to mix with my husband's sperm

629
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,453
so we can shove it up my pussy
so we can make a baby?

630
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,705
God!

631
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,166
At least Fiona's an actual, real,

632
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,918
flesh-and-blood person,
and not some random thumbnail photo.

633
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,546
-I think maybe we should just ask her--
-What are you, crazy?

634
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,049
-Jesus Christ!
-Jesus... Rach, are you crazy?

635
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,676
We can't just ask her.

636
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,848
-She put her picture up on the website.
-That doesn't mean that--

637
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,433
Hey, guys.

638
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,729
What can I get you?

639
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,399
My God!

640
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,110
It's like The Handmaid's Tale.

641
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,779
It would be different if I had, like,

642
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,033
a younger sister or something,
or like a cousin.

643
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,160
Even like a family friend.

644
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,788
Someone we had a real connection with,
so I wasn't just...

645
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,001
preying on the bodies
of random young women.

646
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,298
What?

647
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,402
Really sucks, what you're going through.

648
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,905
Yeah, it does, thanks.

649
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,616
Thanks?

650
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,411
For confirming
that my life sucks right now.

651
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,705
-Okay.
-It really means a lot to me.

652
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,040
Well, you're welcome.

653
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,586
I know technically you're just
my step-uncle and aunt,

654
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,506
but I feel closer to you guys
than everyone else in the family.

655
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,925
You guys get it.

656
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,636
Everyone else is on me all the time
to get my shit together

657
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,721
like I'm some sort of dropout
or something.

658
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,184
You did just drop out of Bard, didn't you?

659
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,563
No, I was given permission
by the dean's office

660
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,898
to finish my degree requirements
in absentia.

661
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,400
Ah!

662
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,945
-That's a thing.
-Yeah. I mean, that's Latin, right?

663
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,113
For "dropped out."

664
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:58,158
-Shut up!
-Ho! Ho! Careful, I'm driving here.

665
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,869
Oh, my God! Even you, Uncle Cool.

666
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,789
You know what? You came up with
that nickname, not me.

667
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,127
And the fact that anyone would refer to me
as cool

668
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,630
is just evidence of how utterly uncool
our family actually is.

669
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,091
-That's true.
-Yeah.

670
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,583
Thought everything was supposed to be
all gentrified now.

671
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,006
Well, I guess they forgot about
our corner.

672
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,595
It's so Serpico.

673
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,891
There you go.

674
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,435
Hey!

675
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,563
Oh, my God! Hi, puppies!

676
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,065
Hi, Sade!

677
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,692
Hi!

678
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,361
Oh, my God!

679
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,779
Whoa, whoa!

680
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,157
God, you guys all right?

681
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,080
So, how do you plan on finishing?

682
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,414
Online.

683
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,166
Really?

684
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,501
Why online?

685
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,380
Because that way, I don't have to talk
to deluded college students

686
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,174
who think the world gives a shit
about their stupid short fiction,

687
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,134
which isn't even fiction
in the first place,

688
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,846
just thinly-veiled autobiographical crap
about their entitled upbringing.

689
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,058
Wow. Thank you.

690
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,644
And I won't have to listen
to what a big deal it is

691
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,564
that they're being published in some
literary magazine no one has heard of,

692
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,149
like Tin House or whatever.

693
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,319
Wait, Tin House?

694
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,657
Tin House is a really well-regarded
literary magazine.

695
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,574
Yeah.

696
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,661
-They published something of yours, right?
-Yeah, once.

697
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,707
So everybody at your school's
getting published in Tin House?

698
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,375
Not everybody.

699
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,962
I just mean in general, like,
everyone is so self-promoting,

700
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,506
and convinced of their artistic promise,
and I'm like,

701
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,800
"Hey, my uncle is an award-winning
theater genius,

702
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,845
and my aunt is a real-life playwright
and author who gets...

703
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:27,933
invited to Yaddo, and gets her stories
published in well-known periodicals

704
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,645
that normal people have actually heard of,
like The New Yorker, for instance.

705
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,855
And they're over 40

706
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,733
and still have to live in
a rent-stabilized apartment on Avenue A

707
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,444
with drunks and graffiti in the front,
so don't talk to me

708
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:42,197
about 'the sacrifices' you're making
to be an artist, okay?"

709
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,663
So good.

710
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,183
Don't you ever miss it?

711
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,769
You guys were so great.

712
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,729
Tell that to the NEA.

713
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,735
Oh, I meant to tell you,

714
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,572
I went by our old space on Walker Street.
You know what it is now?

715
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,115
-No.
-Citibank.

716
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,492
-Ugh.
-My God.

717
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,870
Try doing Grotowski in front of an ATM.

718
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,002
"This was the year that
a small downtown theater collective

719
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:41,006
reminded us of the singular power
of theater to astonish.

720
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:46,345
In Tray, a story set among cafeteria
workers in a suburban high school,

721
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:50,224
La Rata and its director, Richard Grimes,
created a political comedy

722
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,520
that deftly examines the racial
and socioeconomic divide

723
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,063
that plagues our nation."

724
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,482
Who wrote that?

725
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,568
-Jonathan Saks, The Village Voice.
-Oh.

726
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,196
See, that's how sad we are.

727
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,908
We're from a time when
The Village Voice was considered relevant.

728
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,002
Honey.

729
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,213
Honey, are you awake?

730
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,591
-Richard?
-Yeah. What?

731
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,971
Do you think we should do it?

732
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,515
Do what?

733
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,101
Ask Sadie.

734
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,938
She's so young.

735
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,529
Yeah, that's the point, isn't it?

736
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,173
Okay.

737
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,021
-Hey.
-Wow!

738
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,940
How Instagrammable, thank you!

739
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,028
Do you need a...?

740
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,446
Yum.

741
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,324
Thank you.

742
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,416
Oh, my God, look at us.
We're like an ad for assholes.

743
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,464
You mean we're assholes, or we're part
of an ad that's targeted to assholes?

744
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,633
No, it's just that whole...

745
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:54,014
people with cappuccinos in their lofts,
with their laptops, dogs, with messy hair.

746
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,392
You know, that whole fantasy.

747
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,231
It's not your fault. You guys are
authentic and real, you've just been

748
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,568
co-opted by cultural mechanisms
that create desirability.

749
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,698
I took a media and consumer society
course. It was pretty life-altering.

750
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,746
Sadie...

751
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,957
there's something that we want to...

752
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,502
Look at-- Just--

753
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,922
You know I only have one testicle, right?

754
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,054
Yeah, I do, actually.

755
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,391
-You do?
-Charlie mentioned it once.

756
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,018
-He did?
-Not to me personally, but to my mom.

757
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,604
I overheard it
a couple of Thanksgivings ago.

758
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:43,939
I don't remember.

759
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,152
It was when you guys were going through
all that fertility stuff.

760
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,408
We're still going through
all that fertility stuff.

761
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:58,412
-My mom said you were trying to adopt.
-Yeah, we are.

762
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,833
But recently we decided it might be
a good idea to just try everything

763
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,084
all at once.

764
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,004
'Cause, you know,
we're not getting any younger.

765
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,257
-That's for sure.
-Yeah. And we just had a failed IVF.

766
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,719
Wait, what?

767
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,306
-Oh, my God, you guys, I'm so sorry.
-Thanks.

768
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,058
That must suck.

769
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,480
It's not over, though.
You guys are gonna keep trying, right?

770
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:26,898
Well...

771
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,403
now the doctor is suggesting a...
a different approach altogether.

772
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,532
My mom told me you guys had a lot going on
but I had no idea.

773
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,536
Is... This is a really bad time
for me to be crashing here, isn't it?

774
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,830
-No, not at all.
-I have friends in Bushwick...

775
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,582
No, we're so glad that you're here!

776
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,958
-You're sure?
-Yes.

777
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,711
Me, too.

778
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,422
I love you guys.

779
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:00,974
Okay.

780
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,810
-I'll pop in some more toast.
-Good idea.

781
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,230
Oh, does anybody mind if I get started
on the crossword?

782
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,532
Actually, we wanted to ask you
about your eggs.

783
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,661
Scrambled is good, but however you guys
do them is fine with me.

784
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,018
Oh.

785
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,520
-Hey!
-Hey!

786
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,695
Did you mean hay...

787
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,074
-with an "A"?
-No, just "hey" as in "hello."

788
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,494
-Sam, this is my niece Sadie. Sadie, Sam.
-Hi.

789
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,913
-Hi.
-Sadie's gonna help out here for a while.

790
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,623
I thought you could show her the ropes.

791
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,500
Yeah, okay. Cool.

792
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,460
Okay. Come on.

793
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,712
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

794
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,510
I like to be as prepared as possible
the night before the farmers' market,

795
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,679
because, well,

796
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,141
we set up at like, 5:00 a.m.,

797
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,560
and at that hour I am...

798
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:31,231
utterly impaired, and not in a position
to make any kind of business decisions.

799
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,240
Oh, my God, I'm totally whale-tailing,
aren't I?

800
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,324
Sorry.

801
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,369
It's cool.

802
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,962
-I would get a gourmet...
-How often do you guys get this?

803
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,218
-You have no idea!
-You haven't been here!

804
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,761
No crema.

805
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,096
I got extra guac.

806
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,183
-Stop.
-You're getting pico de gallo?

807
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,809
This is not his first rodeo.

808
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,604
My burrito's without cheese, right?

809
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,148
-Yeah.
-Okay. It smells so good.

810
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,192
We got it all.

811
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,696
Oh, my God. What does that even mean?

812
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,159
It's like an open invitation for assholes.

813
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,286
Yes, it is.

814
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,748
Oh, my God, my esophagus is
on fucking fire. I love this.

815
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,128
Sadie.

816
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,760
Rachel and I have been looking for
an egg donor.

817
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,388
You know what that is, right?

818
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,351
Yeah, I do.

819
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:53,563
They advertise for it at school.
I know somebody who did it, a film major.

820
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,568
They paid her like $10,000.
That's how she financed her senior thesis.

821
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,779
It was the entire budget
of her short film.

822
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,615
She named the company "Ovum Productions."

823
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,286
It was really funny at the time.

824
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,080
Not so much now.

825
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,456
No, that's funny.

826
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:14,251
-You know...
-No, no, no. It is. It is.

827
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,675
Well, we wanted to ask you
about your eggs, actually.

828
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,971
In your ovaries.

829
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,809
Oh, okay.

830
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:32,811
What about them?

831
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,108
Well...

832
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,987
we were wondering if you would consider...

833
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,033
donating some.

834
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,536
To us.

835
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,165
-Just like your friend.
-Yeah, except not.

836
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,959
No, no. Yes. Yes.

837
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,252
Because...

838
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,630
you know us, so it would be different.

839
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,013
Wow.

840
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,351
Yeah.

841
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,941
What would this entail, exactly?

842
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,072
Well, technically, you would just
go through pretty much

843
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,533
what I just went through with IVF,
minus the...

844
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,744
-transfer.
-What's the transfer?

845
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,289
That's when they put
the fertilized eggs back into your uterus.

846
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:38,376
-My uterus, in this case.
-Right, yeah. Yes.

847
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,921
It wouldn't be yours,
because it would be Rachel's.

848
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,340
So...

849
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,136
Yeah, your uterus would not be involved
in this instance.

850
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,139
You would be done right after
the retrieval, so...

851
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:56,353
You'd have to get screened

852
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,604
by the clinic first.

853
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,231
Bunch of blood tests,
a psychiatric evaluation.

854
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,984
-Uh-oh!
-No, no, it's nothing like that.

855
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,529
They just wanna make sure you would
be able to handle the whole thing,

856
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,864
psychologically.

857
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,867
Right, so I don't go
all Mary Beth Whitehead on you?

858
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:12,911
Who?

859
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,082
Er, no, nothing, forget it. It's...

860
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,917
-Who was that again?
-Yeah.

861
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,462
The-- Just something we read about
in a medical ethics class.

862
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,092
The surrogate in the Baby M case.

863
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,094
In the '80s.

864
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,597
Yeah, yeah. She refused to give up
the baby or something, right?

865
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,850
Yeah. Sorry.

866
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,229
-Creepy reference. Totally inappropriate.
-No.

867
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,605
That's okay. Okay.

868
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:42,941
So...

869
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,693
what else?

870
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,742
-The drugs?
-Yes, right. The stimulating hormones.

871
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:53,952
How could I forget?

872
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:59,082
You give yourself injections to
increase your egg count for the cycle.

873
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,918
Yeah. It's a lot of...

874
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,838
shots. Let me show you here.
You see them?

875
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,673
-God. Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

876
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,883
I mean, this looks a lot worse than it is.

877
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,718
But the drugs can make you feel...

878
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,555
pretty crazy, mood-wise.

879
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,559
My shrink had a really funny name for it.
What did she call it again?

880
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,354
-"Emotionally incontinent."
-Oh, my God, gross!

881
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,650
But because it's not you trying to have
the baby directly,

882
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,486
it would be way less fraught,
emotionally.

883
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,405
-Don't you think?
-Definitely.

884
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,322
Yeah.

885
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,033
And, of course, we would pay you.

886
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,870
No way, I'm not taking money
from you guys.

887
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,954
No. We insist.

888
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,874
We'd pay you exactly what you would get
in any of the university clinics.

889
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,917
Ten thousand dollars,
just like your friend.

890
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:49,215
It's not a lot of money, considering.
But it's the standard rate, and it's...

891
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,885
it's all we can afford.

892
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,183
You don't have to say anything now.

893
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,524
This...

894
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,280
It's... It's just an overview.

895
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,411
It's a lot to absorb, so just...

896
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,664
take your time and think about it.

897
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,174
Okay.

898
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,634
-Good.
-Okay.

899
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,052
All right.

900
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,472
-Who needs more beer?
-I do!

901
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,808
No. I mean, okay, like, I'll do it.

902
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,602
The egg thing. I'll do it.

903
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,064
You really need to think.
This is a big decision.

904
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,025
-You don't have to answer right now.
-I'm totally cool with it.

905
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,238
It's not like I'm doing anything else
with my life. I don't even have a job.

906
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,531
And...

907
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:59,536
what could be more rewarding than
helping two people I love start a family?

908
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,624
You guys have always been
such role models for me.

909
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,460
You're so supportive, and...

910
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,046
non-judgmental.

911
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,675
You're gonna be amazing parents.

912
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,010
Way better than mine.

913
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,680
Hey. Don't say that.
You have great parents.

914
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,684
We're gonna have to tell them
about this, too, you know.

915
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,479
It has to all be out in the open.
Totally transparent.

916
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,189
I don't see a problem with that.

917
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,191
Yeah?

918
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,861
-You don't?
-My mom's always on me about...

919
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,657
finding purpose
and doing something real with my life.

920
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,619
Well, it doesn't get more real than this,
right?

921
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,067
Be careful!

922
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,612
All right? Did you hear me?

923
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,171
Lunatic, are you filming me like that?

924
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,257
It's just gonna be my bald spot!
That's all it's gonna be.

925
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,950
They're here!

926
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,328
Hey, guys!

927
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:08,956
Come on!

928
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,961
How's everything? You made good time.

929
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,880
You brought your laundry?

930
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,131
Yeah, I did.

931
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,383
-Good.
-Hey!

932
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,300
Hi.

933
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,096
It's, like, quarters only,
and the laundromat had no--

934
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,681
-Hi, Sadie!
-Hi!

935
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,644
-How are you?
-Oh, my God!

936
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,562
Hi! It's so good to see you!

937
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,525
Charlotte! Are you okay?

938
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,696
You brought pie?

939
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,998
I'll get you the rest
before the end of the year!

940
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,634
Come here!

941
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,930
That's okay. I'm so embarrassed.
This is like...

942
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:09,934
Don't be sorry, I didn't realize you were
so sensitive. Is it okay if I go back?

943
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,645
-Go ahead, please. Sorry.
-Mom? How many?

944
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,313
How many what?

945
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,400
-Hi, Nellie! Hi, Jennifer.
-Hi!

946
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,943
You'll play later, right?

947
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,411
Thank you.

948
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,043
They're super comfy. Do you want it?

949
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:36,961
I would love it.

950
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,046
So, I'm not gonna use my...

951
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,216
You know how, like,
all college grads are like...

952
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,385
That's so creepy.

953
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,638
Like, looking down the shirts of girls,
like when we walk around,

954
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,348
we don't have to do anything.

955
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,642
I'm in, like, all AP classes.

956
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,728
Well, you did that to yourself.

957
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,813
No, but I have to do that.

958
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,231
I wanna get in.

959
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,566
You're gonna get in.

960
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,987
Okay, but if I wasn't doing that whole--
Yeah, I can't change it.

961
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,281
Charlie? Charlie...

962
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:09,202
-I cannot manage that.
-Because they don't teach us as kids.

963
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,413
Okay.

964
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:17,210
Charlie and I decided that we wanted
to do Thanksgiving right for a change,

965
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,545
so before we all dig in,

966
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,174
we'd like to invite everyone
to go around the table

967
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,385
and talk about what it is
you're grateful for this year.

968
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,182
-Come on.
-It'll be a "Thanksgiving" Thanksgiving.

969
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,559
Thank you, Charlie, my supportive husband.

970
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,311
Okay, I think I'm going to begin.

971
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:40,441
I would like to say that I am
very thankful to Richard and Rachel.

972
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,651
-Hell, yeah.
-Wow.

973
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,027
Woo!

974
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,781
For giving our daughter, Sadie,

975
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:51,953
all the great love and support she needs
for starting her new life in Manhattan,

976
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,788
and giving her a great home base.

977
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:58,000
And, I just want to say
on a personal note, I know that

978
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,878
you guys have been going through
a really tough time,

979
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:04,423
and the fact that you're taking care of
someone else's child

980
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,093
when you're struggling
to have a child of your own

981
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,264
is just more evidence
of your incredible generosity.

982
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,725
And... I really hope someday that

983
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,229
we can repay you for all that you guys
have done for us, so cheers.

984
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,774
-Hear! Hear!
-Cheers!

985
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,651
Cheers.

986
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,153
-Okay.
-Can I be next?

987
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,614
Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Sadie, go.

988
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,200
Okay.

989
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,535
That was beautiful.

990
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:36,330
And it's the perfect prologue
for what I wanted to say.

991
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,083
I'm also thankful for Richard and Rachel

992
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:42,128
-for everything they've done for me.
-Never been so popular.

993
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:47,550
From letting me intern
at their theater company...

994
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,218
Free labor is more like it.

995
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,431
...to employing me
at the Pickle Guy offices and...

996
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:57,810
most recently, letting me crash at
their place until I get my act together.

997
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,730
I'm especially thankful to you, Rachel.

998
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:06,986
For reading all of my lame attempts
at playwriting and short fiction.

999
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:13,659
And for taking me seriously as an artist
when I have a hard time doing that myself.

1000
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,749
And, finally,

1001
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,669
this seems like the perfect opportunity
to share some exciting news.

1002
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,212
I'm going rogue here.

1003
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,674
I haven't asked Richard and Rachel,
but I can't let this moment go to waste.

1004
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,217
-It's okay.
-No, I don't think--

1005
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,721
What I'm most thankful for this year
is the opportunity

1006
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,432
to help Richard and Rachel
make their dreams come true.

1007
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:41,020
-Sadie, it's not-- Seriously.
-By offering them a tiny bit of myself,

1008
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,565
I get to give these guys the greatest gift
they could have asked for.

1009
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,859
The gift of life.

1010
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:51,989
An oocyte.

1011
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,791
I don't understand. What is an oocyte?

1012
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,709
Isn't it...

1013
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,128
like an egg?

1014
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,925
I've decided to be
Richard and Rachel's egg donor.

1015
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,762
And, if all goes well,

1016
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,764
by this time next year,

1017
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:20,267
we'll all be giving thanks for the newest
member of our family:

1018
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,645
Richard and Rachel's baby.

1019
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:25,731
Cheers.

1020
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:27,358
-We haven't even--
-It's...

1021
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:31,570
Yes!

1022
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,490
Yeah! Yes, it's good news! It's good news.
Cheers!

1023
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:36,951
We haven't even...

1024
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:41,872
-I was gonna-- We haven't coordinated--
-It's my turn now, right?

1025
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,749
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-What?

1026
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,668
On this fabulous Thanksgiving,

1027
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,337
spending it with family and friends,

1028
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,173
I am most grateful for

1029
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,135
being 31 days sober today.

1030
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,388
Clean and sober 31 days.

1031
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,515
Over my dead body! Do you hear me?

1032
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:01,892
This has nothing to do with your body.
It's my body...

1033
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:06,147
It's not blood or checking the organ
donation box on your driver's license.

1034
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,608
You'll be living with this all your life.
Our whole family will be affected.

1035
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,652
-I've given it a lot of thought.
-Have you?

1036
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:15,197
-I wanna help them. It means a lot to me.
-Well, now it's fun.

1037
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,367
You're the center of attention,
but and after the baby's born? What then?

1038
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:23,289
I'll be Aunt Sadie, or Cousin Sadie,
whatever they want me to be. Look, Mom...

1039
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:28,002
What if you had kidney disease, and
I'm your friend and I have two kidneys?

1040
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:31,255
Person only needs one kidney, right?
Of course I'd give it to you!

1041
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,176
Honey, kidney disease kills people.
Rachel wants a baby, she's not dying.

1042
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:39,305
-How do you know?
-Sorry. We were planning to talk to you.

1043
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,306
That's nice.

1044
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,600
How were you planning on paying for it?
Kickstarter?

1045
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:43,684
Jesus, Mom!

1046
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,063
-Why don't we go upstairs and get you--
-Whose side are you on?

1047
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,564
Nobody's side, nobody's side.

1048
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,524
We're not doing this without your support.

1049
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,610
Well, you don't have it.

1050
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,576
So, guys, why don't you just...

1051
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:01,660
Fuck this!

1052
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:05,206
...get some food, go home and then
we'll talk about it some other time, okay?

1053
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,666
-Where are you going?
-I'm getting my laundry!

1054
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,296
God, Mom. You are so anti-Aunt Rachel.

1055
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,882
-I'm not anti-anybody.
-Come on!

1056
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,717
On some level, you're threatened by her.

1057
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,930
'Cause she'll have a book and a baby and
you'll have nothing once Charlotte's gone?

1058
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,641
That's what you think I'm worried about?

1059
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,559
I am worried about you, Sadie.

1060
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:28,437
You could be squandering
your future fertility for all you know.

1061
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,482
My God, you should be freezing your eggs,
not selling them.

1062
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,193
That's absurd.
Tons of girls do it and they're fine.

1063
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,736
Anyway, I'm not having kids.

1064
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:37,655
You do not know that now.

1065
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,032
Yes, I do. I don't want kids,
I want a career.

1066
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,367
You could have both.

1067
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,121
What?

1068
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,998
Do you know how many times you've told me

1069
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,835
that women have to sacrifice things
when they have kids?

1070
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:54,171
That you had to drop out of school
when you had me?

1071
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,218
I get my period every month,
and I flush an egg down the toilet.

1072
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,428
Why not give some to Richard and Rachel?

1073
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,807
What could be more meaningful than me

1074
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:08,727
giving two people I love who are desperate
to start a family the gift of life?

1075
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:09,979
Oh, my God.

1076
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,357
-They've brainwashed you.
-Oh...

1077
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,945
Why do you feel so cheated by life, Mom?

1078
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,617
And if I can just make it through today...

1079
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:25,786
just today...

1080
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:29,331
I will be one third of the way through
the Bermuda Triangle.

1081
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,916
I am not happy about this!

1082
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,252
Maybe we should've gone with
an anonymous donor.

1083
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,880
-Goddammit.
-This is not a good idea!

1084
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,590
Honey!

1085
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,467
I know you want a child,

1086
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,345
-but this is my child we're talking about.
-I am not a child!

1087
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,681
-Understood, Cynthia.
-If she was your daughter,

1088
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,016
would you want her to do this?

1089
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,643
-Goodnight. Come on, okay?
-Cynthia, we haven't even--

1090
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,437
-Okay. Thanks!
-Sadie!

1091
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,981
-This is madness.
-We're gonna call you in--

1092
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,680
Third-party reproduction is usually
an arrangement

1093
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:30,184
between anonymous
or unrelated individuals.

1094
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:38,067
But some couples prefer to involve
a family member,

1095
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,444
or a trusted friend, which is fine.

1096
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,782
As long as all the people involved
are consenting adults,

1097
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,784
it should not be a problem.

1098
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:53,374
Now, that's not to say that
this kind of collaboration

1099
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:57,002
doesn't bring up some intense feelings
for everyone,

1100
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,837
including the extended family.

1101
01:10:58,921 --> 01:10:59,922
Of course it does.

1102
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,508
This is uncharted territory
for most people.

1103
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,970
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

1104
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:09,640
We don't even know if Sadie's
an appropriate candidate for egg donation.

1105
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,187
My advice is to get the process started,

1106
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,690
and then use the time
to wrap your heads around

1107
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,442
what this arrangement might mean
for you and your family.

1108
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,745
Then, after the reports come back

1109
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:35,291
and Sadie's completed
her psychological evaluation...

1110
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:42,548
...you can sit down and make
a fully-informed decision.

1111
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,827
I call him Uncle Richard,
but he's actually

1112
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,996
my stepfather Charlie's brother.

1113
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,248
So we're not really related.

1114
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,294
Which is probably better
for something like this.

1115
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:21,628
Right.

1116
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:25,341
Because... otherwise, it would be incest.

1117
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,887
For the record, I don't have a problem
with the whole donor thing.

1118
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,766
Not to say I don't think it's weird.
It's weird, but...

1119
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,143
I'm a periodontist.

1120
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:40,814
I graft freeze-dried cadaver bones into
the mouths of living people every day.

1121
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,024
I can handle weird.

1122
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:43,692
Ugh!

1123
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:47,363
But Cynthia?

1124
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:51,909
She's different, she's much more
sensitive, especially these days.

1125
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,620
She's been having a really tough time...

1126
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,372
hormonally.

1127
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:30,864
Honey...

1128
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,575
they're screening her.

1129
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:35,953
Who's screening her?

1130
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,289
The clinic for the egg donation.

1131
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:45,963
-You might wanna talk to her about it.
-She doesn't need my permission.

1132
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,715
Well, that's true, she doesn't.

1133
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,431
Honey,
what if Richard and Rachel were gay?

1134
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,308
-Please!
-No, I'm serious. What would you say?

1135
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,520
If they were a gay male couple
and they wanted to start a family

1136
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,980
and Sadie wanted to help them.

1137
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,149
I would say, "Mazel tov.

1138
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:08,485
Now go get some girl off the internet
and leave us out of it."

1139
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,865
Sadie doesn't understand what it is
she's doing. She's just...

1140
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,076
throwing around her genetic material
like it's popcorn.

1141
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,329
Auctioning off family property
like it's no big deal.

1142
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,501
Well, they're family.

1143
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,463
-What?
-Richard and Rachel are family.

1144
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:37,514
-What are you doing? Oh, my God--
-There's something on your chin.

1145
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,975
-Can you not, please? Do you mind?
-It's bleeding.

1146
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,479
It's nothing. It's a pimple.
My God, Charlie, please.

1147
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:46,064
Don't touch me. I'm trying to concentrate.

1148
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,524
I got into Berkeley!

1149
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,944
-What!
-My early decision letter came. I got in!

1150
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,405
-Oh, my God, let me see!
-I'm going to Berkeley!

1151
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,867
You did it! I'm so proud of you!

1152
01:14:57,117 --> 01:15:01,705
-We are so proud of her, right, Cyn?
-It's great, honey, I'm so happy for you.

1153
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,209
What happened to your face, Mom?

1154
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:10,506
It's nothing. It's just a little...

1155
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,678
It's-- It's just this...

1156
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,096
pimple.

1157
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,057
Stupid. Just...

1158
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,187
We'll meet you downstairs, okay?

1159
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,104
Oh, okay.

1160
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:28,106
It's okay, it's okay.

1161
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,998
"Ms. Sadie Barrett has applied to become
a donor in the Conceptions Oocyte

1162
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,041
Donor Program.

1163
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,919
The purpose of this evaluation
is to gain insight

1164
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,964
into her psychological
and emotional well-being.

1165
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:57,010
Psychological testing indicates no
significant evidence of psychopathology."

1166
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,471
-Woo! Yeah!
-Awesome!

1167
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:01,181
Wait, this is the good part.

1168
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:06,228
"Ms. Barrett presented as a bright,
sophisticated, and charismatic young woman

1169
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,022
who appears comfortable
with her decision to donate.

1170
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:12,734
She is mature and intelligent
and it is likely that she will

1171
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:15,445
comply with the medical demands
of the donation.

1172
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:19,950
In conclusion, Ms. Barrett is approved
as a candidate for oocyte donation."

1173
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,077
-Yeah! Yes!
-Yes!

1174
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,955
-I was a little worried.
-I was very worried about you.

1175
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:25,956
Psychiatric!

1176
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,416
You passed?

1177
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,418
Why are you so surprised?

1178
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,794
I'm not, I'm just...

1179
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,588
You know, I thought maybe...

1180
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,638
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1181
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,101
You know that I love you, right?

1182
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,440
Even though I don't agree with you,
at all...

1183
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:53,609
I respect you,

1184
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:57,654
and if this project is something you feel
you need to do, then you should do it.

1185
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,990
So you're cool with it?

1186
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:03,660
No, I'm not "cool" with it.
I'm not cool with anything, ever.

1187
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,164
But I see how much this means to you,

1188
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:11,168
and I don't want to stand in your way.
I want to support you. No matter what.

1189
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,128
You do?

1190
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,592
Doesn't mean I'm happy about it.

1191
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,519
Wow! Christmas!

1192
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,231
What does this stuff do?

1193
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:37,235
It shuts down our reproductive systems
so they can sync up our cycles.

1194
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,655
Yikes.

1195
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,616
Any risk of, like, triggering menopause?

1196
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:46,912
Technically, it is menopause.
It's chemically-induced, it's temporary.

1197
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,789
Okay, I'm gonna start with Rachel.

1198
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:49,956
-All right.
-Yup.

1199
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,668
-There you go.
-All right.

1200
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,796
All right.

1201
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,464
Ready?

1202
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,883
One, two, three.

1203
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:03,845
See?

1204
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,891
-Subcutaneous. No biggie.
-All righty, your turn.

1205
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,937
Oh, my God, this is so glamorous.
We're like Drugstore Cowboy.

1206
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,499
All done.

1207
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,050
He wants me to start stimming.

1208
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:54,146
Warning: this stuff can make you feel
really crazy and all over the place.

1209
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,232
"Emotionally incontinent." I remember.
Don't worry. I can handle it.

1210
01:18:57,315 --> 01:18:58,859
One, two, three.

1211
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,153
-Oh! Shit!
-One, two...

1212
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:09,411
Oh, I love it!

1213
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:12,205
Are you sure you don't want it?
It's in perfect condition.

1214
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,585
No, it's... better for you.
I can't wear that anymore.

1215
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:20,547
Oh, no. You're not gonna start...
draping, are you?

1216
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,926
God, my mom went on this jag
where she got rid of, like,

1217
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:28,013
everything in her closet
that was even remotely form-fitting,

1218
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,681
and now it's just like cowl necks,

1219
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:34,644
and tunics, and draw strings, and shawls,
that whole Eileen Fisher thing.

1220
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:36,855
It's like she doesn't even
have a body anymore,

1221
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:41,651
she's just drowning inside all this fabric
and erased all sexuality from her being.

1222
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,236
It's like she's been spayed.

1223
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:50,494
Can I use some of your lotion?
My skin is so dry. I'm molting.

1224
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,746
Yeah, sure, whatever's there.

1225
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:03,215
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

1226
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:07,177
My boobs are so big from those drugs,
I look like a porn star.

1227
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,559
You're gonna be such a great mom.

1228
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,063
I am?

1229
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,232
Uh-huh. Totally.

1230
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,900
I wish you were my mom.

1231
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,903
-What? That's crazy.
-No, it's not.

1232
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,947
I think of you like that sometimes.

1233
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,493
Like, you're my art mom,
and Richard is my art dad,

1234
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,203
and I'm your art daughter.

1235
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:39,042
And now it's gonna be, like, so intense,
because a little part of me,

1236
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,171
mixed with a little part of him,
is gonna be growing inside of you.

1237
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,804
Do you think Sam is attractive?

1238
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,352
-What?
-Sam, who works at Pickle Guy?

1239
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:02,274
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.

1240
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,317
I think he's attractive

1241
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,696
in a kind of "fucked-up character
in a Sam Shepard play" way.

1242
01:21:09,614 --> 01:21:11,157
Broken, but hot.

1243
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,830
Do you think our baby will grow up
to be a writer?

1244
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,250
Yours and Sam's?

1245
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,710
No, yours and mine.

1246
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,136
Shit, it's my editor.

1247
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,639
-Hi, Liz.
-Have you seen it?

1248
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,143
No. Seen what?

1249
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:39,853
-Sorry.
-The book jacket.

1250
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,065
Okay. Okay.

1251
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:46,067
Holding, holding, holding...

1252
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,571
Okay.

1253
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,412
Are you there?

1254
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:05,295
It totally misrepresents the book.

1255
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:09,215
Then it's like, oh, I don't understand
the business side, which I don't.

1256
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:13,720
But I do know if a guy wrote it,
it wouldn't be packaged like a cupcake.

1257
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,306
So sick of this shit.

1258
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:20,101
Same thing with this whole fertility
nightmare. I just feel so betrayed.

1259
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,186
By what?

1260
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:24,105
You know,
the bullshit I was fed in college.

1261
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,650
Feminist ideology.

1262
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,736
The lie that I could have a career
and then kids.

1263
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:31,863
Well, obviously that hasn't panned out.

1264
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:34,532
Should send them the bills
for our IUI's and IVF's.

1265
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:38,995
You can't blame second-wave feminism
for our ambivalence about having a kid.

1266
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,041
I'm not ambivalent.

1267
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:44,876
No, now you're not.

1268
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,879
Because you realize that the boat
is leaving the dock. But...

1269
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:51,508
before, you kept changing the deadline.
Remember?

1270
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,595
You know, "We'll start
as soon as I finish the play,"

1271
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:58,515
"right after I get this story published,"

1272
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,266
"once I finish the book."

1273
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:02,394
Are you blaming me?

1274
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,189
No, I'm not blaming you.

1275
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:11,027
I'm just saying that we need to take
some responsibility for the situation.

1276
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:15,323
A lot of women have babies at 41.
I thought I could, too.

1277
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,451
Okay.

1278
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,913
I just don't think
it's Gloria Steinem's fault

1279
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,373
that we can't get pregnant.

1280
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,792
Whose fault is it, then?

1281
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,295
I guess it is mine, because I was too busy
writing my stupid book.

1282
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,508
I didn't say that.

1283
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:39,431
All the doctors ever talk about is
my advanced maternal age, my old eggs.

1284
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,100
Then we're in the middle of an IVF and,
what a surprise,

1285
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:45,145
your sperm is, like, on a sabbatical.

1286
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,858
-Whoa. What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

1287
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:51,735
Let's just drop it.

1288
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,654
All I'm saying is that we can't blame
Dr. Dordick,

1289
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,364
or Bella Abzug,

1290
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,241
or anybody else for our fuck-up.

1291
01:23:58,324 --> 01:23:59,868
You mean my fuck-up!

1292
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,912
Why do I feel like
I'm in a Wendy Wasserstein play?

1293
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:06,332
I don't know, but it's our anniversary
and I've got to go get a...

1294
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:09,294
dildo cam shoved up my twat
by Dr. Dordick,

1295
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,714
so can we just not talk about this
right now, and just repress it?

1296
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:16,676
Or suppress it, or whichever one
is more appropriate for this instant,

1297
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,803
so we can just keep this train on track?

1298
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,140
It's "suppress."

1299
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,188
When you consciously forget something,
that's suppression.

1300
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,190
Repression is unconscious.

1301
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,660
-Hey.
-Sadie? You--

1302
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:27,413
Surprise!

1303
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:30,875
Happy anniversary.

1304
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,256
-It smells so good.
-Yeah!

1305
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:37,924
Oh, my God!

1306
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:41,344
"Donny, calm down and have a tonic!"

1307
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:42,762
Oh, my God!

1308
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,977
Did you ever read Innocence
by Harold Brodkey?

1309
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:52,272
No, I don't think so.

1310
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:53,731
Me, neither.

1311
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,317
It's pretty life-altering.

1312
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,529
-Wait, that the Harvard cunnilingus one?
-Yeah, that one.

1313
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,366
It's all about a guy going down
on a girl, right?

1314
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:07,704
Yeah. I read it in a contemporary
short fiction class.

1315
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,956
And then, as an assignment, I wrote,

1316
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:15,336
a kind of tongue-in-cheek response to it,
that I called Experience.

1317
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:16,421
No pun intended.

1318
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:22,218
A "tongue-in-cheek response" to a story
about cunnilingus. Somebody had to say it!

1319
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:23,344
Come on!

1320
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:25,972
It's still a work in progress, but...

1321
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:29,601
I was wondering,
if you guys were interested,

1322
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,561
I'd love to get your thoughts about it.

1323
01:26:31,644 --> 01:26:33,980
-Oh, my God, yes. I can't wait.
-Absolutely. Sure.

1324
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:36,232
Oh, God. That would be so great.

1325
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,984
But it has to be top secret,

1326
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:42,113
because my mom has been asking to see
my writing all semester

1327
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:45,533
and the thought of her reading about me...

1328
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:47,744
choking on cock,

1329
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:50,788
even in a fictional piece, is horrifying.

1330
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,259
It's intense.

1331
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:06,012
Oh, my God. You don't have to
look at that tonight.

1332
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:07,222
No, hey.

1333
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:08,890
It's our anniversary.

1334
01:27:09,432 --> 01:27:11,184
At least I can read about fellatio.

1335
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,310
Oh, my God.

1336
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:18,816
-Yeah, yeah!
-Just kidding.

1337
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:21,778
Bye, guys.

1338
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:23,863
Where you going?

1339
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:26,824
To meet Sam.

1340
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,079
Oh. Cool.

1341
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:32,497
Yeah, cool.

1342
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:35,416
Well... have a good time.

1343
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,585
-Yeah, have fun.
-All right.

1344
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:39,170
Just don't have sex.

1345
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:44,050
You know if it-- Just, not right now.

1346
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,095
I'm not planning on having sex with Sam.

1347
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,640
No, I know, just, you know,
if it comes up.

1348
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,227
You're extremely fertile, at the moment.

1349
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,397
-We're just going to the movies.
-What are you guys seeing?

1350
01:27:58,147 --> 01:28:00,900
Something at Anthology Film Archives.

1351
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:03,569
Documentary about some music guy.

1352
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:09,742
I'm concerned with the fact
that I have not been made a doctorate

1353
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:12,787
at any college, and Bill Cosby has.

1354
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:17,333
Even Dylan has.

1355
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:19,877
George Martin is made a Sir.

1356
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,047
Paul McCartney is made a Sir.
Elton John is made a Sir.

1357
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,550
Buddy Holly's given a stamp.

1358
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:26,467
You know--

1359
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,053
-Definitely not a good date movie.
-No.

1360
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,973
They should have a warning.
"Should not bring a date to this movie."

1361
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:38,104
-Total vibe kill. Emphasis on "kill."
-Well, I guess I blew it, then.

1362
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,189
What?

1363
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:42,066
Our date.

1364
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:45,695
Oh. Wait, no. This isn't a--

1365
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:48,740
I thought so.

1366
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,201
-Oh.
-It's up to you.

1367
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,830
Are we...

1368
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,084
on a date?

1369
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:02,211
Good question.

1370
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:19,145
Do not freak out.

1371
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,397
We didn't do anything, I swear.

1372
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,816
Just, like, cuddled and kissed.

1373
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:25,401
Nothing vaginal.

1374
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:28,571
Okay. I think I'm gonna wait in the car.

1375
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,698
You take my seat, and...

1376
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:33,368
I'm gonna see you guys after, okay? So...

1377
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,454
Oh, my God. The trains were so messed up.

1378
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,248
You missed the appointment.

1379
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:41,793
Didn't you get my text?

1380
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,462
Texting isn't being here on time.

1381
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,632
Okay. I'm sorry.

1382
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,134
But, like I told you,
the trains were messed up.

1383
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:57,392
Where are you going?

1384
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,851
To see if they can get you in.

1385
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:02,730
So, she just showed up.

1386
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,482
Is there any way you can possibly
get her in?

1387
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:06,609
-Can you guys wait?
-That's fine.

1388
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:09,153
-Okay. You're welcome.
-Yes. Thank you so much.

1389
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:22,792
What did they say?

1390
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,921
They said they can squeeze you in
in half an hour.

1391
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:28,381
Oh, okay. Cool.

1392
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:30,800
So there's no problem, then.

1393
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:37,890
I'm gonna wait in the car, too.

1394
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,318
Oh, honey.

1395
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:51,446
Hey!

1396
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,239
Over here!

1397
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:55,366
It's pouring!

1398
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:59,203
-I can sit in the back.
-No, no. Sit in the front.

1399
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:00,705
Hey!

1400
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:02,415
Man!

1401
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:07,753
I got you a Green Goddess
with a shot of wheat grass.

1402
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,382
Are you okay?

1403
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,304
-Oh, no.
-God.

1404
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:20,683
Honey, I'm sorry I got so mad.
I think I overreacted.

1405
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:23,436
That's not it?

1406
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:30,485
The doctor just yelled at me and said
my eggs aren't developing on schedule.

1407
01:31:33,362 --> 01:31:35,239
-What?
-Dordick yelled at you?

1408
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,657
Dr. Russell.

1409
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,202
-Who's Dr. Russell?
-I think that was his name.

1410
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,746
He said that I didn't have
enough follicles,

1411
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:45,041
that I'm a "low responder,"

1412
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,543
that someone my age should have way more,

1413
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:50,505
and my eggs aren't growing
at the right rate or something.

1414
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:55,885
He said that he has 41-year-old patients
who produce more eggs than me.

1415
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,055
Oh, my God.

1416
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,227
Honey, what are you doing? What--

1417
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,737
I need to talk to Dr. Russell.

1418
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,281
I'm sorry, Mr. Grimes,
he's with patients all morning.

1419
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:19,575
But I can get him a message if you'd like.

1420
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:25,373
Yeah, okay.
Tell him that my niece is not a chicken.

1421
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,001
Write it down. Please.

1422
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:31,087
Yes, tell him that our donor,

1423
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,339
who is giving us the gift of life,

1424
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:37,134
-is being treated like a piece of shit.
-Please keep your voice down, Mr. Grimes.

1425
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,719
Is there a problem?

1426
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:41,097
Dr. Russell, this is Richard Grimes.

1427
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,433
Oh, hey. Dr. Frank Perdue. How are you?

1428
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,018
I'm sorry, what--

1429
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,272
Are you? Really? Sorry? Really?

1430
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:53,526
Because my niece is sitting out there
crying in my car,

1431
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:56,862
feeling like some kind
of a failed factory farm animal,

1432
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:59,615
because you told her she's not producing
enough goddamn eggs!

1433
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,200
Okay. Should I call security?

1434
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,744
I don't know. You tell me.

1435
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,586
Sorry about-- Sorry.

1436
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:13,588
Sorry. I got it.

1437
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,466
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1438
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:21,470
I'll just collect that with the jacket.

1439
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:24,640
Shit.

1440
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,998
Hi. Hi!

1441
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:56,422
Those guys driving you crazy up there?

1442
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:59,008
I've been living in a dorm
for three months.

1443
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:00,509
That's right.

1444
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:06,307
You know...

1445
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:09,685
You can call it quits any time you want.

1446
01:34:10,102 --> 01:34:10,936
Okay?

1447
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,940
Don't worry
about the stupid numbers thing.

1448
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,692
All it takes is one good egg.

1449
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,029
That's what they keep telling us, anyway.

1450
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,158
Okay.

1451
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:26,452
-Night.
-Good night.

1452
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,462
-Hi.
-Hey.

1453
01:34:37,296 --> 01:34:39,048
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

1454
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:41,133
-Good.
-Good.

1455
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,972
-I need to...
-Oh, yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

1456
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:01,862
Hey, Sadie?

1457
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,491
Are you freaking out?

1458
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:11,580
-No. Not really. Should I be?
-No, I...

1459
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,378
You just seem kind of distant.

1460
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:23,008
-I'm in the bathroom.
-No, about the other morning, you...

1461
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,262
you left before I woke up.

1462
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:27,763
Oh.

1463
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,725
I'm sorry. I was...

1464
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:34,687
running late for something.
I'm not trying to be coy or anything.

1465
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,522
It's just...

1466
01:35:38,482 --> 01:35:41,610
there's a lot of personal shit
I'm dealing with right now.

1467
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:49,326
"Human Chorionic Gonadotropin."

1468
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,662
Jesus. Could it sound more sci-fi?

1469
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,456
They call it the trigger shot.

1470
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:57,460
Makes you ovulate, and then
36 hours later, the retrieval,

1471
01:35:57,543 --> 01:36:00,129
and then, finito!

1472
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,465
Okay. You ready?

1473
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,800
-Okay.
-All righty.

1474
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,553
Okay.

1475
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:14,477
All right. One, two, three.

1476
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:25,362
I guess it's stating the obvious, but...

1477
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,741
we couldn't have done this without you.

1478
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:33,871
Oh, my God. You know what
we never even talked about?

1479
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:35,664
What?

1480
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,708
That whole birthing thing.

1481
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,795
Are you guys gonna do it
at home with, like,

1482
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:46,759
a doula and a bath tub, and placenta?

1483
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:48,844
Natural childbirth?

1484
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:58,813
Nothing about this has been natural
so far.

1485
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:02,274
I don't see why we would start now.

1486
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:14,161
She said I had the most boring job
in the world.

1487
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:19,625
All I do all day is put people to sleep.

1488
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:25,923
Okay. Wow.

1489
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:33,639
Really? Okay.

1490
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:39,645
They did ICSI on 15 eggs. Six fertilized
and they're waiting on two more.

1491
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,481
Is that good?

1492
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:50,281
I'm so happy.

1493
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,584
Did you gain a lot of weight after?

1494
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:05,254
I swear I've put on, like,
12 pounds in three days.

1495
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:10,634
Sometimes it takes a while for your body
to re-adjust after all the hormones.

1496
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,094
I wouldn't worry about it.

1497
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,056
Coffee's on the table.
And scrambled eggs and strawberries.

1498
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,974
Thanks.

1499
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:19,184
-All right. Feel better.
-I will.

1500
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,062
-See you later.
-Bye.

1501
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:31,322
How is she gaining weight?
She hasn't eaten anything in two days.

1502
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,158
It's water retention. It's totally normal.

1503
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:50,633
Oh, yeah, sure.

1504
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,343
No one wants that.

1505
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,262
-Me, three.
-Okey-dokey. Here we go.

1506
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,140
You guys...

1507
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,081
Hey.

1508
01:39:22,164 --> 01:39:23,916
You okay?

1509
01:39:23,999 --> 01:39:25,793
I don't know. I don't know.

1510
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:31,548
-What the heck's going on?
-Something feels wrong. I--

1511
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:42,059
It started a few days ago,
after the retrieval.

1512
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:44,895
Yeah. We're in the middle of an IVF.

1513
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,730
-You're trying to get pregnant?
-No.

1514
01:39:47,022 --> 01:39:48,440
-I am.
-Right.

1515
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:51,443
I thought you two were her parents.

1516
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,070
-Prospective parents.
-Right.

1517
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,865
She's my aunt, he's my uncle.
I'm just the donor.

1518
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:59,535
-It's complicated.
-I can see that.

1519
01:39:59,868 --> 01:40:01,704
Were there any difficulties
with the retrieval?

1520
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:02,705
No.

1521
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:08,544
Actually...

1522
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:11,797
I mean, yeah. Sort of.

1523
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:14,925
What happened?

1524
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:16,969
Well, I wasn't...

1525
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:21,098
-I didn't have enough follicles...
-Okay.

1526
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:24,476
...so I increased the dose of Follitropin.

1527
01:40:25,227 --> 01:40:26,186
By how much?

1528
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:27,563
Like...

1529
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,189
Oh, my God.

1530
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:31,984
God, that doctor is a fucking idiot.

1531
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:33,402
No, it wasn't him.

1532
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:36,488
He didn't make me do it.

1533
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:38,115
I did it myself.

1534
01:40:39,783 --> 01:40:40,617
What?

1535
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,664
I increased the dosage on my own.

1536
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:50,294
Sadie...

1537
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:54,798
I just really wanted this to work out
for you guys.

1538
01:40:55,716 --> 01:41:01,138
You've spent so much money.
And I know how much it means to you.

1539
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:06,310
And I didn't want to disappoint you.

1540
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:11,065
It's okay. It's all right.

1541
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:24,912
Knock-knock.

1542
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:33,087
It's okay, Mom. I'm fine.

1543
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,880
They're just observing.

1544
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,965
Sweetheart.

1545
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:39,384
My baby.

1546
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:44,932
It's not their fault.

1547
01:41:46,016 --> 01:41:47,726
It was me. I was the idiot.

1548
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,812
Discontinue the progesterone,

1549
01:43:55,896 --> 01:44:00,108
the estrogen patches, the Estrace,
as well as the supplements.

1550
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:05,239
Barbara will call next week to schedule
a meeting to talk about next steps.

1551
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:08,825
I'm sorry, guys.

1552
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,829
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

1553
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:31,848
-Where are you going?
-Walk the dogs.

1554
01:44:56,164 --> 01:44:57,332
I'm so sad.

1555
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:02,879
Richard?

1556
01:45:06,508 --> 01:45:09,761
God. Don't those people
ever fucking stop partying?

1557
01:45:12,264 --> 01:45:14,182
Fuck!

1558
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:16,143
Goddamn...

1559
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:36,330
Did you hear me?

1560
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:39,499
Yeah, I did.

1561
01:45:44,546 --> 01:45:48,925
And I know, intellectually, that I am
supposed to do something for you now.

1562
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:55,766
Comfort you, or whatever.
But I'm sorry that I can't.

1563
01:45:59,478 --> 01:46:00,854
I just don't have it in me.

1564
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:09,112
Okay.

1565
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:16,870
You're gonna hate me for saying this.

1566
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,377
You're gonna think
it's hideous sacrilege, but...

1567
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:31,635
I'm actually kinda glad
that the cycle didn't work.

1568
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,431
Because at least now it's over.

1569
01:46:42,687 --> 01:46:45,565
I know it's harsh,
but that's honestly how I feel.

1570
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:47,984
Relieved.

1571
01:46:56,785 --> 01:46:59,204
I don't think I even want to have
a kid anymore.

1572
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,583
I just want my life back.

1573
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:08,630
I mean, look at us. We're a mess.

1574
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:13,468
It's like we're not even
in a relationship, let alone a marriage.

1575
01:47:13,552 --> 01:47:14,761
I'm not your husband,

1576
01:47:15,053 --> 01:47:18,390
I'm just some guy that injects hormones
into your ass every night.

1577
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,313
We don't even have sex.

1578
01:47:29,067 --> 01:47:31,778
-Wait, is that what this is about? Sex?
-No.

1579
01:47:32,737 --> 01:47:34,030
Yeah. I...

1580
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:37,617
Well, maybe. I don't know.

1581
01:47:39,494 --> 01:47:42,122
What do you think?
Think we're ever gonna have sex again?

1582
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:48,378
Are you actually asking me that right now,
or are you being theoretical?

1583
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,047
No, I'm not. I'm actually asking you.

1584
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:54,593
Do you think that we will ever
have sex again?

1585
01:47:58,346 --> 01:47:59,473
I don't know, Richard.

1586
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:04,603
-You don't know?
-I... Yeah, I mean, yes.

1587
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:07,772
I... Yes. Yes, at some point.

1588
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,067
-At what point will that be, exactly?
-I don't know!

1589
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:13,862
Why are you so fixated on this?

1590
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:19,826
I'm not. I am simply pointing out that
since we have been so obsessed...

1591
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:24,539
with this project, we've had sex
maybe one time in 11 months.

1592
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:29,211
And you had to get trashed on a bottle
of rosé before you would even consider it!

1593
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:34,424
I mean, Jesus-- Dr. Dordick is more
intimate with your vagina than I am!

1594
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:37,093
Oh, my God. Do you want sex right now?
Is that it?

1595
01:48:38,553 --> 01:48:40,639
'Cause we just had a failed IVF.

1596
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:44,059
And I don't know about you,
but that makes me feel pretty shitty.

1597
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:47,437
And dead. And despondent.
And doesn't put me in a...

1598
01:48:47,854 --> 01:48:50,440
particularly erotic frame of mind.

1599
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:53,401
But if you're dead set on it, you know...

1600
01:48:53,693 --> 01:48:56,446
I'm sure we can manage something.

1601
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:01,701
Just can't guarantee
it's gonna be a hell of a lot of fun.

1602
01:49:01,826 --> 01:49:04,329
Look, battery still works.
It's our lucky day.

1603
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:12,939
Okay, slow down. It's easy to miss.

1604
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:15,567
Right there! That's it.

1605
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:53,605
-Hello.
-Hey.

1606
01:50:53,688 --> 01:50:55,690
-Hi!
-Hi, Sadie?

1607
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:57,442
-Yeah.
-Hey, I'm Jonathan.

1608
01:50:57,901 --> 01:51:00,320
Nice to meet you. This is for you.

1609
01:51:00,403 --> 01:51:01,488
-Cool.
-All right.

1610
01:51:01,905 --> 01:51:04,949
-Hello! Hi, I'm Richard. Nice to meet you.
-Jonathan, nice to meet you.

1611
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:06,284
-Hi! I'm Rachel.
-My wife, Rachel.

1612
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:09,579
That's them.

1613
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:12,374
Spencer and Katrina Trask.

1614
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,377
Our patron saints.

1615
01:51:16,503 --> 01:51:18,963
-Terrible luck with children.
-They couldn't have them?

1616
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:21,716
No, they had four,
but all of them died young.

1617
01:51:21,966 --> 01:51:23,635
Some of them are actually buried here.

1618
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,679
And after the children were gone,

1619
01:51:25,845 --> 01:51:30,058
they decided they'd turn their estate into
a place where artists could come and work.

1620
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:33,311
That's why you're here, that's why
I'm here, that's why everyone's here.

1621
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:36,106
It's all in your packet, too.

1622
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:42,821
Holy smokes!

1623
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,657
-Wait. What is...
-Well, well, well!

1624
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,910
-Are you serious?
-Wow!

1625
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:51,204
-Look at this.
-This was Katrina's room.

1626
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:52,831
Wow.

1627
01:51:52,914 --> 01:51:55,792
Look. You even have
your own fainting couch.

1628
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:58,002
-Wait, this is my room?
-Mm-hm.

1629
01:51:59,504 --> 01:52:00,922
Oh, my God!

1630
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:04,926
Wow. I've been here three times.
I never got this room.

1631
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:06,553
This is...

1632
01:52:17,355 --> 01:52:18,189
So...

1633
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:21,401
we'll get you in, like, a month. Right?

1634
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:23,778
Actually, you don't need to.

1635
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:27,157
Sam said he could do it.

1636
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:32,746
He's just always wanted to see
Saratoga Springs and...

1637
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:36,332
thought it would save you guys the trip.

1638
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:42,589
Thank you for whatever strings
you had to pull to get me in here.

1639
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,550
I didn't pull any strings.

1640
01:52:48,553 --> 01:52:51,890
You didn't put in a good word for me?
I thought that's why I got accepted.

1641
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:05,570
Okay.

1642
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,501
Go get it! Go get it!

1643
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:50,782
Trick or treat!

1644
01:53:50,907 --> 01:53:53,201
Wow. You guys look great!

1645
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:54,619
What are you?

1646
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:56,246
Climate change.

1647
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,914
-Ah!
-Who are you?

1648
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:02,544
Richard Nixon.

1649
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:06,172
He was the President
from when I was a kid.

1650
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,009
I wanted to wear my Bill Clinton,
but I couldn't find it.

1651
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:13,054
I guess he's before your time, too.

1652
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:17,475
Oh, sorry.

1653
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:21,646
There we go. How's that?

1654
01:54:22,272 --> 01:54:23,231
Thank you.

1655
01:54:23,481 --> 01:54:24,816
-Thank you.
-All right.

1656
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:34,492
Sorry about the environment!

1657
01:54:44,627 --> 01:54:45,461
Hey.

1658
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:47,005
Where'd you find it?

1659
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:51,259
Linen closet.

1660
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:28,755
-Come here. Come here!
-Where?

1661
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:31,299
Ah...

1662
01:55:32,467 --> 01:55:33,968
It's the 800 number!

1663
01:55:37,513 --> 01:55:38,598
Here. Answer it.

1664
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:41,142
-Why me?
-I... Come on!

1665
01:55:41,684 --> 01:55:42,518
Okay.

1666
01:55:43,478 --> 01:55:44,354
Hello?

1667
01:55:45,855 --> 01:55:46,856
Yeah, that's us.

1668
01:55:49,525 --> 01:55:53,655
No, no. We're so happy you called.
This is the perfect time.

1669
01:55:54,572 --> 01:55:55,907
We're just out for...

1670
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:57,492
Halloween.

1671
01:55:58,868 --> 01:56:00,161
Yeah. New York City.

1672
01:56:00,912 --> 01:56:03,790
Well, it's got its pros and cons.
Where are you...

1673
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:05,625
Where are you from?

1674
01:56:06,376 --> 01:56:07,210
Oh, wow.

1675
01:56:09,128 --> 01:56:11,297
No, we've never been to Virginia.

1676
01:56:30,441 --> 01:56:31,734
Land, ho.

1677
01:56:53,423 --> 01:56:54,465
Thank you.

1678
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:55,717
-You good?
-Yeah.

1679
01:56:58,136 --> 01:56:59,012
All righty.

1680
01:57:07,687 --> 01:57:09,647
-Thank you.
-Great, thanks.

1681
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:13,693
Oh, actually, we're expecting someone.

1682
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:15,945
-I'll grab another menu.
-Okay.

1683
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:28,226
There.

1684
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:31,062
That's better.
