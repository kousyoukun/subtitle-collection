2
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,858
Come on. Let's go.

3
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,141
I made eggs.

4
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,242
So I'm gonna pick you up
after practice at five.

5
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,243
Six.

6
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,411
I wanna shoot around.

7
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,583
Is that Chad kid
still giving you trouble?

8
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:39,986
Nope.

9
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,522
Okay.

10
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,927
Hey, Sammy. Sammy, come on.

11
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:51,162
So I was thinking,

12
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,466
- How about I call your coach?
- No! Hell no!

13
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,502
Language.

14
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,006
Good morning.

15
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,439
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,342
Good morning.

17
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,908
Hey, Dad.

18
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:12,581
So, the Warriors are playing

19
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,818
the Thunder tomorrow
in Oklahoma City.

20
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,419
What do you think
is gonna happen?

21
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,123
Well, Steph Curry just scored
thirty-two points last night.

22
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,423
So what I think is that,

23
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:24,495
Chef Curry is gonna
whomp on 'em.

24
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,464
I don't know.
Durant's pretty good.

25
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,469
He is the reigning MVP.

26
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:32,238
John.

27
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,544
Is somebody gonna bless
our food?

28
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,481
Okay. Well, I guess I will.

29
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:51,023
Lord, though he exasperates me
to no end,

30
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,024
I am grateful for my son.

31
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,696
For I know that you've
created him for a purpose,

32
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:59,161
thus far only known to you.

33
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:05,402
Bless this food
to our bodies. Amen.

34
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,639
- Amen.
- Amen.

35
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,142
I'm thinking about
raising your allowance

36
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:14,577
to 100 bucks a week.

37
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,341
What are you doing?

38
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,178
Your mom is just trying to get
her son's attention.

39
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,651
Hey, John.

40
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,955
- Wassup, guys?
- Hug.

41
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,231
Please go.

42
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,599
Oh.

43
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,933
Hey, Mrs. J.

44
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,370
Hey, Chayla. Hey, Emma.
How are you girls?

45
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,707
Living the dream, Mrs. J.

46
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,772
Oh, I tried to friend you
on the Instagram,

47
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,609
but I must be doing
something wrong.

48
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,743
Oh, my God!

49
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,413
Please, just go, Ma.

50
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,378
I'm kidding!

51
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,546
Have a good day!

52
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:25,550
Bye!

53
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,189
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

54
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:35,659
Good morning, students.

55
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,029
<i>Today is Thursday, January 15th.</i>

56
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,765
<i>Yearbook committee
meets after school today.</i>

57
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,534
<i>And there's a basketball game
at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.</i>

58
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:46,669
Go Eagles!

59
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,873
Yeah! Go Eagles!

60
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:49,841
<i>Lastly,</i>

61
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,176
a reminder that Monday
is a national holiday

62
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:57,582
in remembrance of
Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.

63
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,349
Emma and I got tickets
to see the musical <i>Hairspray</i>

64
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,717
at the Fox Saturday night.

65
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:03,786
Wow! Yeah, that sounds like fun.

66
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,322
Mmm, dudes in tights.

67
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,058
It's not a ballet.

68
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,459
Look, I'm pretty sure
they'll be wearing pants.

69
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,362
So what are you guys doing?

70
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,695
We're crashing at Rieger's
after the game.

71
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,197
- So jealous.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

72
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,134
<i>Please stand
for the Pledge of Allegiance.</i>

73
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,368
<i>Place your right hand
over your heart.</i>

74
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,704
<i>Ready? Begin.</i>

75
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:21,972
I pledge allegiance
to the Flag

76
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,106
of the United States of America

77
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,575
and to the Republic
for which it stands

78
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:29,113
one Nation under God

79
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,714
indivisible

80
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,918
with liberty and justice
for all.

81
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,053
We might have
some girls over, too.

82
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,022
- Who?
- Can't say until it happens.

83
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,827
- But they're hot.
- Totally.

84
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:44,794
Hey, whoa. You're joking, right?

85
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:45,930
No.

86
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,364
Josh Rieger,
Josh Sanders, quiet please.

87
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:52,136
Okay, gang. Family oral history
reports continue.

88
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,939
Yesterday we heard
from Chad Green,

89
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,543
whose family came over
on the <i>Mayflower.</i>

90
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,879
My husband's family did as well.

91
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:03,948
His great-great-grandfather
was a knight of some kind.

92
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,149
And then we heard from Chayla,

93
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,984
whose family lineage includes
the birth of the blues

94
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:10,454
in Memphis, Tennessee.

95
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,293
John, would you do the honors
and kick us off, please?

96
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,296
Didn't do it.

97
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,264
Why not?

98
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't have time.

99
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:31,744
If you don't do the assignment,
you'll get a failing grade.

100
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,815
"Yesterday is not ours
to recover,

101
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,187
"but tomorrow is ours
to win or lose."

102
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,156
Doreen, you're up.

103
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:55,901
Oh, wow!

104
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,342
<i>"My child,
you believe me for so little.</i>

105
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:08,980
"Don't be so safe
in the things you pray."

106
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,047
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Hey, lady.

107
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,682
- Hey, morning.
- Morning, Joyce.

108
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,320
The morning
got away from me.

109
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,653
Does anyone need
any more coffee?

110
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:17,756
- No, thank you.
- No, thanks.

111
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,390
- Hey.
- What passage?

112
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,426
Is everything all right?

113
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,528
Not exactly.

114
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,294
John's birthday
is coming up,

115
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:27,132
Mmm-hmm.

116
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,265
Oh, I remember those always
been hard for him.

117
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,101
Yeah. It's like he's building
this wall between us.

118
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,537
And I hate myself for it.

119
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,972
I know he's hurting
and I just wanna fix it.

120
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,707
They're always so much harder
to deal with

121
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,808
once they start shaving.

122
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,914
And then
they leave for college.

123
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:43,414
Come on.

124
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,850
Sorry, ladies.

125
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,754
I did read the book twice.

126
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:50,620
Uh, so where were we?

127
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,188
Um, we were just talking about

128
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,759
how Beth Moore is asking us
to pray boldly.

129
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:59,194
So, what does it mean
to you all, "to pray boldly"?

130
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:00,864
I don't know. It just seems,

131
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,933
- Oh! Hey, ladies.
- Pastor.

132
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,900
Uh, we need to use this room
for a staff meeting.

133
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:06,337
You guys wrapping things up?

134
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,672
Uh, no.

135
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:10,707
Not for another 22 minutes.

136
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,445
And I have a women's ministry
meeting here, back-to-back.

137
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,013
Oh, um,

138
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,615
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that's gonna work.

139
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,618
I'm sorry?

140
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,452
I reserved both times
on the sign-up sheet.

141
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,920
Okay. All I have on
my calendar is staff meeting.

142
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,858
Where's this elusive
sign-up sheet?

143
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,562
Taped to the door
that you walked in.

144
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:34,466
Been going on ten years now.

145
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,869
Oh.

146
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,705
Well, it's official.

147
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,874
We're going digital, ladies.
See Maddy for details.

148
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:47,144
Listen, I don't know
what you do in California,

149
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,545
but I have been leading
this women's ministry meeting

150
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,645
for over five years.

151
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:51,814
We don't cancel meetings...

152
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,183
I don't know
who's counting, Joyce,

153
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,584
but I've been in ministry
for over ten years,

154
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:56,919
including California.

155
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,020
Hey, maybe you guys could use

156
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:59,389
that Starbucks
around the corner?

157
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,823
That'd be fun, right?

158
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:01,759
Oh, are you paying?

159
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,130
Well, I hadn't thought
about it, but, uh,

160
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:06,431
Great.

161
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:10,500
Okay, ladies,
let's get out of here

162
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,971
because our new pastor,

163
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:16,539
has more important business
to tend to.

164
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,807
No, that's not true.

165
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,077
I'm sorry, ladies. I promise,
this will not happen next week.

166
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,244
Thank you, Pastor.

167
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,380
And please, I've been asking
for six months.

168
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,514
Call me Jason.

169
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,847
We know, Pastor.

170
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,618
Why are you so hard on him?

171
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,651
That haircut, for one.

172
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:33,155
Right here, right here.

173
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:34,658
Good rebound.
Let's run, Eagle.

174
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,226
Set up that offense.

175
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,330
Spread out the floor.
Spread it out.

176
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,399
Come on, John. Set it up.

177
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,401
I'm open.

178
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,000
Nice, nice.

179
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,202
Yes! Good job, guys.

180
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,406
Come on now,
spread it out. Defense.

181
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:49,972
Hands up.

182
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,443
Defense, defense.

183
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,545
Hands up! Hands up.

184
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:55,077
There you go.

185
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,915
- Nice.
- Nice shot!

186
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:59,517
Spread that floor.
There you go.

187
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,251
Spread it out. Move it out.

188
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:03,555
- Go, go, go.
- There they go.

189
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,789
Watch him.

190
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,825
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.

191
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,031
Hands up on D now.

192
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:18,367
Very nice, John! Nice steal.
There you go.

193
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,570
Good job, John.

194
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,673
Can't catch me,
so you gotta foul me?

195
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:25,808
Whatever, <i>ese.</i>

196
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,976
What'd you just call me?

197
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:29,245
Knock it off!

198
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,349
Next guy who swings is benched.

199
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,386
Practice is over. Wash up.

200
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,589
John, Chad, bring it here.

201
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,195
What's up with you guys?

202
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:47,496
John beat you out for starting guard, Chad.
Deal with it.

203
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:48,765
Temporary.

204
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,534
Whatever. You wanna start,
better change schools.

205
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:52,337
Enough!

206
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,974
News flash.
You're not in the NBA yet.

207
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,610
And acting like that,
you aren't ever gonna get there.

208
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,512
Understood?

209
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,048
All right, wash up.

210
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,685
John, hold up. I wanna
talk to you for a minute.

211
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,888
What's this I hear about
you getting a failing grade

212
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,392
in your family history
assignment?

213
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Why does it matter?

214
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,626
Well, unless
you figure it out,

215
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:19,696
I'm gonna have to bench you
for Sunday's game.

216
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,433
- What? That's bull...
- Hey.

217
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,299
Whatever.

218
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:25,671
You're a good player, John.

219
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,172
But right now you're blowing it.

220
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:32,477
What's going on with you lately?

221
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:37,648
I'm cool.

222
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,318
I'll see ya, Coach.

223
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,697
Hey! How was practice?

224
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,565
Fine.

225
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,838
How was school?

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,676
Oh, let me guess. Fine.

227
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,812
What are you working on?

228
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,748
Oral report.

229
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,183
Maybe I could help.

230
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,493
What are you saving 'em for?

231
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,362
Your Jordans?

232
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,330
When it's the right time.

233
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,740
Okay.

234
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,860
Baby, come back downstairs.

235
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,865
All your friends are waiting
to sing "Happy Birthday" to you.

236
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:10,776
What's wrong?

237
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,244
Everybody's waiting.

238
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:20,485
Why didn't she wanna
have a party for me?

239
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,489
Why didn't she want me?

240
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,092
For what it's worth,

241
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,263
you have a purpose
and you are loved.

242
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,506
Mr. Smith.

243
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,611
Nice of you to join us
this morning.

244
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,215
I'm ready to do my oral report.

245
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:56,354
Okay, so, I'm John Smith.

246
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:57,789
Uh,

247
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,858
Most of you know I'm adopted.

248
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,461
I come from a small town
in Guatemala called Sansare.

249
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:04,930
Um...

250
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,399
I don't know
who my biological mother is,

251
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,500
but just that
she didn't want me.

252
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:12,671
Uh,

253
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,473
Joyce and Brian Smith adopted me
when I was nine months old.

254
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,242
They went down there
on a missions trip

255
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:22,580
and they ended up
coming home with me.

256
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,216
Probably because I'm so cute.

257
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,687
But yeah,

258
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:45,702
Okay, okay.

259
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,236
Brian,
that space right there.

260
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,572
Okay, I'm on it.
I'm on it.

261
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,345
- Okay.
- Hey, guys.

262
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,748
And, John,

Thank you.

309
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:56,666
You were amazing.

310
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,734
Hey, let's give it up
for our guest.

311
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,839
Rob, thank you so much.

312
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,106
So dope, and thank you.

313
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,043
Show of hands. Who here,

314
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,745
including me and my wife,
by the way,

315
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:10,781
are addicted to <i>The Bachelor?</i>

316
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,386
Okay.

317
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:17,689
Liars.

318
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:22,693
Liars! I know there's way more
of you out there than that.

319
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,459
It's a sin to lie, people.

320
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:27,465
It's even a worse sin
to lie in church, so...

321
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:29,700
Okay.

322
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:31,536
Cathy?

323
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,569
I'mma pick on you for a second.

324
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,036
Cathy, I happen to know,

325
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,273
because I overheard it in
a supermarket checkout line,

326
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:38,877
that you watch
<i>Bachelor in Paradise.</i>

327
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,778
Now nobody watches just
<i>Bachelor in Paradise.</i>

328
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,450
I'm sorry, that's like saying
I go to Arby's...

329
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,886
you know, just for the salads.

330
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:50,686
Yes, I do watch it.

331
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:52,188
Okay, that's what I thought.

332
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,657
And I bet that means that your
husband, Bob, watches it too.

333
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:55,760
Bob, I get it. I get it.

334
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,826
At first, it was 'cause she
forced you to do it, right?

335
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,794
You got hooked.
You got a problem now, right?

336
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:02,997
You're like, "How is Andy ever
gonna find true love?" Right?

337
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,904
Remember this guy last season,
Juan Pablo?

338
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,339
This guy.

339
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:11,142
You know what really
ticked me off about this guy?

340
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:15,143
He kept asking these women
to make a commitment,

341
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:16,380
week after week.

342
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:19,214
But when it came time for him
to make a commitment,

343
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,785
he chickened out, right?

344
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,520
He kept saying,
"Will you accept my rose?

345
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,857
"Will you accept my rose?
Will you...?"

346
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,959
But when someone asked him
to get up to the plate...

347
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,962
he couldn't find the courage
to do it.

348
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:33,931
I'm pretty sure you guys all
know where I'm going with this,

349
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,266
but it's true.

350
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,969
Week after week
He's there for us.

351
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:44,073
And, yeah, God is asking
for a lifetime commitment too.

352
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:47,144
But here's the good news,
and I do mean the good news.

353
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:50,781
He didn't just give us
a rose, right?

354
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:57,721
He gave us
the most valuable thing

355
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,791
that He had to give.

356
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:03,527
His son.

357
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:09,130
And I think that means
that we probably

358
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,702
shouldn't be commitment-phobes
either, right?

359
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,841
All right,
let's open our Bibles.

360
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,409
The Gospel of Luke.

361
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:21,977
You coming
to the game tonight?

362
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:24,313
No. I'm not gonna
be able to make it, Joyce.

363
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,480
Hey, Joyce!

364
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,649
- Paula, how are you?
- Hi. So good to see you.

365
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,351
You too. Thank you.

366
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:31,222
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

367
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,124
Hi, Joyce.

368
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,492
Oh, what do you guys have on
for the rest of the day?

369
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,326
Uh, well, John's got
a basketball game.

370
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:41,330
Oh, yeah? I've seen John hoop
it up a little bit around here.

371
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:42,867
This guy's a beast!

372
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,699
What do you say, J-Money?

373
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:46,637
Coming to Youth Group this week?

374
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,638
Weak sauce! Come on!

375
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,840
All right, I'll come.

376
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,178
Boom! There we go.
This kid is so...

377
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:55,546
lit!

378
00:21:57,414 --> 00:21:59,747
I've no idea
what you're going on about,

379
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,583
but we have got to go.

380
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,752
- Nice sermon today, Pastor.
- Thanks, Brian.

381
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,190
Hey, uh, call me Jason.

382
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:06,924
Jason.

383
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:09,158
Take it, John, take it!

384
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,495
Good job.

385
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,699
Let's go, Eagles! Let's go!

386
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,533
They gotta hold 'em.

387
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:18,836
Come on, defense!

388
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:22,838
Let's go, defense!

389
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,540
You need to spread it out!

390
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,444
- Here we go, yeah, John!
- Good job.

391
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,680
Okay, now,
look at the clock.

392
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,783
John, set up Eagle!

393
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,119
Come on, John! Set it up!

394
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:36,252
- Get back!
- Eagle!

395
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,286
John, he's open!
Pass it to him!

396
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:39,554
- Eagle!
- Three!

397
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:41,559
- John!
- Two!

398
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:43,027
One!

399
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,630
Yeah! Oh, yeah, John.

400
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:50,166
John Smith!

401
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,571
That was a good game,
but next time I call a play

402
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:57,307
you better listen to me,
you hear me?

403
00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,677
All right, go wash up.
Good game!

404
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:05,415
You got 'em from here?

405
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:06,681
We do.

406
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,316
We're gonna grab pizza
on the way home.

407
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:09,518
Great. Thank you, Cindy.

408
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,018
- Any time.
- Good game.

409
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,022
You too.

410
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:14,623
Text your mom tomorrow,
and tell her

411
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,390
when and where
to pick you up, okay?

412
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,129
Please, don't forget.

413
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:19,361
I won't.

414
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:20,729
It was a good game, son.

415
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:21,965
Yeah.

416
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:23,834
Have a great time.

417
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,704
And, uh, don't do
anything stupid.

418
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,074
Okay, Brian.

419
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,006
Love you, guys.

420
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:35,980
I'm sorry,
you're okay with that?

421
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:38,480
It's just a phase.

422
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:40,717
He's just trying
to get a reaction.

423
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:43,685
By calling you Brian? Or not
hugging his mother goodbye?

424
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:45,256
A little bit of both.

425
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,492
He just needs some space,

426
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:50,994
and maybe we should
loosen up a bit.

427
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:55,033
Listen, you can't be his father
and his best friend, Brian.

428
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:56,700
Why not?

429
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,203
Because it doesn't work
that way.

430
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:09,378
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- You want to see this drift?

431
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,345
- Ready?
- Yeah.

432
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,384
Abby just liked my post.

433
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:17,820
She's cool.
I mean, she's no Molly, but,

434
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:20,091
Molly?
She moved to Texas.

435
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,693
So? She texts me,
like, all the time.

436
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,360
Almost there.

437
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:27,998
Big dub!

438
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:30,401
- Come play, John.
- In a minute.

439
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:31,835
All right.

440
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:41,444
Oh! You were an ugly baby.

441
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,513
That's not me, fool.
That's my dad.

442
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,113
I'm the other one.

443
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:48,152
My mom thinks it's funny
'cause we look exactly alike.

444
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:51,322
You do,
and you're both ugly.

445
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:53,690
- Hey, guys?
- Yeah, Mom?

446
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:56,026
Let's not stay up
all night, okay?

447
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:57,592
Night, Mrs. Rieger.

448
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:58,962
Good night, boys.

449
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,075
Cool! Let's go!

450
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,181
Whoo!

451
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,419
Right here.
Right here. Right here.

452
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,488
Go! Go! Go! Hold up!

453
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:27,889
- Pass it.
- Yeah.

454
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,559
That's for little kids!

455
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,561
Pass.

456
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:32,928
Hey, get on this thing.
Get on this thing.

457
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,830
- Wait for me.
- Push me.

458
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,431
- Go! Go! Go!
- Spin him! Spin him!

459
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:40,768
Keep going! Go faster!

460
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,373
Okay! Okay! Stop it!

461
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,744
I'm dizzy! I'm dizzy!
I'm dizzy!

462
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,945
Hey, guys.
Let's check out the lake!

463
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,448
Oh, my God!

464
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,153
Okay, let's go.

465
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,290
Check this out!

466
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:06,094
- Yeah, we're good.
- Plenty thick.

467
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:06,998
Let's go.

468
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:12,469
I'm still dizzy!

469
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:14,870
Come on! Don't be a wuss!

470
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:16,975
- Yeah, come on!
- Let's play tag.

471
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:18,909
Tag him.

472
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,380
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

473
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:24,479
Tag! You're it!

474
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:25,648
Let's go!

475
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:28,650
Come on!

476
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,652
Go, go, go!

477
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,392
- The puck is loose!
- Come here!

478
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:38,496
John's got it!

479
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,963
Goal!

480
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,240
Okay, say, "Eagles."
Three!

481
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:53,844
Two! One!

482
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,113
Eagles!

483
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:58,550
Tag him! Tag him!

484
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,919
- I'm on it.
- No!

485
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,717
Oh, he's slipping!
Get him!

486
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,419
- No!
- Yeah!

487
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:08,390
- Yo! No way! No way!
- Stay down. Yeah!

488
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,726
Whoa! It's slippery,
guys. Watch out.

489
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:11,860
We got you.

490
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:13,228
Hey, boys!

491
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,364
Get off the ice!

492
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,733
Not safe!

493
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,469
We're training
for the Olympics, sir.

494
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,571
Please don't be a dream killer.

495
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,036
Maybe he's right.

496
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:23,371
Have you heard a single crack?

497
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:26,074
Guys? Now,
or I'm calling the cops.

498
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,111
Yes, sir.

499
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,011
We just need
to catch our friend first.

500
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,146
What? No, hey!

501
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,081
- Get him!
- Get back here.

502
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,714
- Not it. Stop!
- Oh, my God!

503
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:34,115
Pin him down.
Pin him down.

504
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,286
Yo, easy! Come on!

505
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:39,121
Hey! Hey!

506
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:41,090
You got me, okay?

507
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,459
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yo, stop!

508
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,701
Josh, hold on!

509
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:29,705
I can't! I can't hold on.
My hands are too cold.

510
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,140
- I'm slipping. I'm slipping.
- Hold on, Rieger, hold on!

511
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:33,675
- I can't get up!
- Just breathe!

512
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:34,776
Here. I'll push you out!

513
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:37,180
Here. I got you. Hold on!

514
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:43,120
John!

515
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,719
Hey, John!

516
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:46,589
John!
Grab my hand, John!

517
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,890
- John!
- John!

518
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,925
- Swim, come on!
- John! John!

519
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,659
He went under.
I can't see his face!

520
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:53,096
- Help!
- Where'd he go?

521
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,700
Swim!
You can do it.

522
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:00,637
John!

523
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,644
Please, someone help!

524
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:11,950
John!

525
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,398
Please, someone!

526
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:37,171
Help!

527
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:38,607
<i>9-1-1,
what's your emergency?</i>

528
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,043
Three boys,
they fell through the ice.

529
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,410
You gotta send help right now!

530
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:43,778
<i>All available trucks,</i>

531
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,015
<i>we have a drowning event
at Lake Saint Louis.</i>

532
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,748
<i>Call out locations please. Over.</i>

533
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,016
- Move!
- Let's go!

534
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,396
Truck 11, we're at the station
seven minutes out.

535
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,601
We're inbound with
water rescue gear. Over.

536
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,209
Where are they?

537
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,244
Just down there. Right over there!
Thirty yards out.

538
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,480
All right.

539
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:24,585
<i>East entrance.
Thirty yards off shore.</i>

540
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,655
<i>Local police have arrived
on scene.</i>

541
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,024
<i>One out, one in the water,
one under the ice.</i>

542
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,158
How long?

543
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,392
<i>Approximately five
to seven minutes,</i>

544
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,696
<i>according to witnesses.</i>

545
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,067
Copy. Tell Chief
we're two minutes out.

546
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:47,176
- Help us!
- Whoa!

547
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,479
- She's breaking under me.
- Stay back! I'll go!

548
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,982
Stay there!
We're coming to get you!

549
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:01,991
Please help us. Hurry!

550
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:07,629
Hurry! Please!

551
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,864
Please, help us.

552
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:10,799
I can't hold on
much longer.

553
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,733
He's under the water.

554
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,404
Let me get your friend.
I'll get you next.

555
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:16,239
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

556
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,038
Come on, I got ya.

557
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,108
Thank you.

558
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,574
Okay. Okay.

559
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,909
Come on!

560
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,917
Let's get the pike pole,
so we can drag the bottom.

561
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,986
- We need more!
- How many do we need?

562
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:32,720
I know this area of the lake.

563
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:34,355
Ten, maybe 12 feet deep.

564
00:31:34,357 --> 00:31:36,158
- Grab three!
- Got it.

565
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:38,192
- Still got one under, Chief?
- Yeah.

566
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:40,762
But dive and retrieval
with tanks are inbound.

567
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:42,397
The crack's widening.

568
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,399
We've gotta get the other kid
away from the edge.

569
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,534
- How's yours?
- Hypothermic, but still breathing.

570
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:48,303
The ice is giving way.
Be careful!

571
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:49,470
How long's mine been under?

572
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,441
At least ten minutes
by our count!

573
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,409
Please save him.

574
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,812
He's under the water.

575
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,514
He went under the water.
Please! His name is John.

576
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,382
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Please! Please save him.

577
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:03,552
I want you to crawl over
and grab this officer's hand.

578
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,519
We're going to do everything
we can to find John.

579
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:07,624
- Come on.
- Please find him.

580
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:14,397
Easy getting in, Joe.

581
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:17,502
We don't wanna push him
farther under.

582
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,736
Let's work from back to front.

583
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,414
Is the area widening,
or is it just me?

584
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:32,816
It's getting bigger.

585
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:37,622
Bottom contact's about ten feet.

586
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,625
We gotta find this kid.

587
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:44,829
Ready.

588
00:32:48,864 --> 00:32:49,999
What's the count?

589
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,234
Fifteen minutes.

590
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:53,967
It's gonna be a recovery,
not a rescue.

591
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:55,670
Hey, EMT?

592
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,037
Get your backpack.

593
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,909
I need another backpack.

594
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,579
- <i>Go back.</i>
- Go back.

595
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:08,485
Sounds like Chief just said,
"Go back."

596
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,085
I missed it.

597
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,194
What's he talking about?

598
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:27,036
I can't see past
three feet. It's way too murky.

599
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:28,839
I don't wanna cut him.

600
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:33,641
Tommy, if he went
under the ice back there,

601
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:34,411
he's a goner.

602
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,446
The outmost edge drops off
to 25 feet or more.

603
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:44,522
<i>Come on, John. Be here.</i>

604
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,396
I got something.

605
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:53,998
What is it?

606
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:55,732
Is it him?

607
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:57,299
Tommy?

608
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,370
Don't lose him, Tommy.

609
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:04,707
- Pull him up. Pull him up.
- We got him.

610
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,474
We got him!

611
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:06,842
I'm losing my grip.

612
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,312
We got him!

613
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,053
Crew, throw the line!

614
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,420
Rope is out.
Prepare for retrieval.

615
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,757
I got him.

616
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:23,025
Pull!

617
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,393
Here we go!

618
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,493
Pull!

619
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:27,597
Come on! Keep going!

620
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,567
He has no pulse.

621
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:34,372
Start compressions.

622
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,806
Go! Go! Go!

623
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:40,674
Two! Three! Four! Five!

624
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:41,678
Stop!

625
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,151
Pull! Pull!

626
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:51,589
One! Two! Three! Four! Five...

627
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,223
Nine! Ten! Eleven! Twelve...

628
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:06,069
Ventilation tube.

629
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:07,805
One! Two!

630
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:24,888
Come on, John.

631
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:32,328
Cindy!

632
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:33,929
I've been expecting your call.

633
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,364
<i>Joyce,
so there's been an accident.</i>

634
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:38,098
<i>Uh, the boys were out
playing on the ice</i>

635
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,068
<i>and they fell through.</i>

636
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,737
<i>So you need to get
to the hospital right now.</i>

637
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,108
<i>They have John there.
All the boys are there.</i>

638
00:35:57,687 --> 00:35:58,455
Hey!

639
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,989
<i>I'm just picking up that
dimmer switch that you wanted.</i>

640
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:01,892
Brian!

641
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,392
- <i>John was in an accident.</i>
- Joyce.

642
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,129
The boys fell through the ice!

643
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,763
- <i>Joyce, Joyce. Slow down.</i>
- I'm going to St. Joseph West Hospital.

644
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:08,797
Can you please meet me there?

645
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:11,468
<i>Okay, okay.
I'll meet you there.</i>

646
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:23,814
Joyce, calm down.

647
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:25,716
Calm down.

648
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:36,660
What do we know?

649
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:39,460
Fourteen-year-old male,
unresponsive and pulseless.

650
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:41,228
He was playing on the ice
and fell through.

651
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,096
Five hundred cc bolus given.

652
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:44,334
He's very cold to touch.

653
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:47,070
Keith, take over
CPR compressions.

654
00:36:47,303 --> 00:36:49,372
Let's bolus him,
normal saline.

655
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,875
Run the IV wide open.
We use a weight of 80 pounds.

656
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,779
Prepare to give epinephrine.

657
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,618
Epinephrine is in.

658
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:08,491
Hold compressions.

659
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:12,596
No pulse. Still cold.

660
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:15,129
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
No response.

661
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:16,263
Resume compressions.

662
00:37:16,265 --> 00:37:17,634
Prepare to give epinephrine.

663
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:21,536
Epinephrine 0.38 milligrams.

664
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:22,770
The temp is 88 degrees.

665
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,839
How much long till
the next pulse check?

666
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,541
Thirty seconds.

667
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,442
Please, Lord.
Please, Lord Jesus.

668
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,344
Please.

669
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:30,145
Check pulse
at the next pulse check.

670
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,913
If there is no pulse,
we're gonna shock him.

671
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:34,082
Gotta try something.
Shock at a 150 joules.

672
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,350
- Preparing to shock.
- Two minutes.

673
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:38,888
No pulse.

674
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,056
Everyone, clear.

675
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,355
Shocking.

676
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:46,095
No pulse.

677
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,395
What's
the outside temperature?

678
00:37:48,397 --> 00:37:49,464
Low 50s.

679
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:50,734
Lake water can't
be cold enough

680
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:52,833
to have done his heart any good,
or his brain for that matter.

681
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,103
Temp is up
to 90 degrees.

682
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,737
- <i>Prepare to give epinephrine.</i>
- Epinephrine is in.

683
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,707
Epinephrine,
0.38 milligrams.

684
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,410
Think, Kent. Think.

685
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,676
How much epi have we given?

686
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:03,980
Eight doses, Doctor.

687
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:08,819
Prepare to shock.

688
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:13,891
Two minutes.

689
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,460
No pulse.

690
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:19,497
All right.
Everybody, clear.

691
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:21,965
Shocking.

692
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,368
No pulse.

693
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,604
Temp is up to 95 degrees.

694
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:29,105
He's warm.

695
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,277
Total time
is 45 minutes, Doctor.

696
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,248
Doctor Sutterer.

697
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:43,587
There's...

698
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,689
There's, uh...

699
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,958
There's nothing more we can do.

700
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:02,873
We'll wait on his mother.

701
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:04,638
Keith, keep going.

702
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,276
I'm not going anywhere, boss.

703
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,013
Please, Lord.
Please, Lord Jesus.

704
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:30,464
I'm here for John Smith.

705
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:31,368
Okay.

706
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,000
You can have a seat
right over there.

707
00:39:33,002 --> 00:39:35,002
We're just waiting
for his parents to arrive.

708
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,272
I am his mother.

709
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,007
I'm sorry.

710
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,309
Just a moment.

711
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:50,153
She's here.

712
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:51,821
Should I bring her down?

713
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:53,856
I'll go.

714
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:15,942
- Joyce, I'm here.
- They won't let me see him!

715
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:18,179
My John is in there and they
will not let me see him!

716
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:18,882
Isn't that illegal?

717
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,051
We just need
to be patient.

718
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,819
- Joyce Smith?
- Yes? I'm Joyce.

719
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:27,254
Hi. I'm Doctor Kent Sutterer.

720
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,857
We're doing everything we can
for your son,

721
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:31,362
but John isn't responding.

722
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:34,694
What does that mean?

723
00:40:34,696 --> 00:40:35,832
Let me take you to him.

724
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:56,754
Okay, team.

725
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,226
Keith.

726
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:19,242
Joyce, we'll be right outside.

727
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:40,730
Please, uh, take as long
as you need to say goodbye.

728
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:46,837
What?

729
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,853
I don't understand.

730
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:07,621
I don't understand.

731
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:10,026
Um...

732
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,364
I don't understand.

733
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:20,467
I don't understand. I don't,

734
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:21,772
No.

735
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:25,174
No, no, no.

736
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,910
No!

737
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:30,513
No!

738
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:41,656
No, no, no. God.

739
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:43,790
Please, Jesus, please.

740
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,560
Please, Jesus.

741
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:48,531
My John. My John...

742
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:58,873
Holy Spirit, I need you now.

743
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,875
I need you now.

744
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:04,047
Please, please,
don't take my son.

745
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,149
Please! Please!

746
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:10,750
Please bring life
back into John.

747
00:43:10,752 --> 00:43:12,018
Please!

748
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,990
Please, God!
Please, please, please.

749
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,792
Come, breathe life into John.

750
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:21,898
Please, God...

751
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:23,964
Please, God.

752
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:25,933
Please, God.

753
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:28,902
Send your Holy
Spirit to save my son!

754
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,377
- We've got a pulse!
- What?

755
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:38,679
What?

756
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,183
We've got a pulse!

757
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:42,384
We've got a pulse! Trauma two.

758
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:45,252
Page Respiratory and let
them know we need a ventilator.

759
00:43:45,254 --> 00:43:47,455
- You got a pulse?
- Yes.

760
00:43:47,457 --> 00:43:48,658
Prepare intubation.

761
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:50,625
I'll get the NG
and be ready

762
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:52,359
to insert it post-intubation.

763
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,565
Joyce?

764
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,665
Where's John?

765
00:43:58,667 --> 00:43:59,870
Joyce.

766
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:02,670
Oh, Brian.

767
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:04,105
- How's John?
- Well...

768
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:07,074
John's got a pulse,
but it's weak.

769
00:44:07,076 --> 00:44:09,377
Now, we're doing everything
we can to stabilize him,

770
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:10,511
and we're airlifting him

771
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:12,714
to Cardinal Glennon
downtown right now.

772
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,018
They've got the foremost expert
in drowning, Doctor Garrett.

773
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,355
Now, in my opinion,
he's John's only chance.

774
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:21,188
ATC, this is Cardinal
Glennon 3-3-4 airlift wing.

775
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,091
I'll follow you there,
honey!

776
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,891
<i>Go for CGCH.</i>

777
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:27,594
We're requesting
a flight program now.

778
00:44:27,596 --> 00:44:29,297
<i>I have you
coming in at pad two</i>

779
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,401
<i>with escort and trauma support
staff to assist.</i>

780
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:35,739
Ma'am, are you able to fly?

781
00:44:36,138 --> 00:44:38,306
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

782
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:40,209
You're hyperventilating.

783
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,243
I'm scared to death of heights.

784
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,612
I think it might be better
if you traveled by car.

785
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:47,313
No, I'm not gonna leave my son!

786
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:48,350
Okay!

787
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:05,933
Hey, babe!

788
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:07,335
<i>You'll be proud of me.
I'm jogging off that...</i>

789
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,036
John Smith fell through
a frozen lake!

790
00:45:09,038 --> 00:45:09,939
Wait, what?

791
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,538
They're airlifting him
to Cardinal Glennon.

792
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,573
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

793
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,044
I'm on my way.

794
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,851
- You're John's mother, right?
- Yes.

795
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:26,286
I need you
to come with me, ma'am.

796
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:28,522
Doctor Garrett will be
the physician attending to John.

797
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:29,926
- Okay.
- Okay.

798
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:35,395
We'll come find you as soon
as we get him situated.

799
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:37,864
- Okay.
- You can have a seat right over there.

800
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:42,239
Smith family.
He was helicoptered in from St. Joseph.

801
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,375
Uh, she's here now, so...

802
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:48,576
We'll let you know
as soon as we hear something.

803
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:49,676
Thank you.

804
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,384
It's really not
a good time right now.

805
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:57,620
Yeah, I know, Joyce.

806
00:45:58,488 --> 00:45:59,690
That's why I'm here.

807
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:02,325
Well, thanks for coming.

808
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:05,261
Well, I'm not leaving.

809
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,460
Not now, anyway.

810
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:08,531
Excuse me?

811
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:11,232
Look, Joyce.
I know you might not be

812
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:12,902
the biggest fan
of how I preach,

813
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,538
or my haircut.

814
00:46:15,538 --> 00:46:18,138
But I'm John's pastor.
And I'm your pastor.

815
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,373
I think that means
that right now,

816
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,775
we gotta set aside
our differences.

817
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,679
We gotta focus on John. Right?

818
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:26,149
Brian!

819
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:31,020
Thank you for coming.

820
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,395
Yes, Doctor.
We've increased the drip rate.

821
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:43,232
<i>I'm Doctor Garrett.</i>

822
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,636
I'm sorry to be meeting
under these circumstances.

823
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,341
Your son is alive,

824
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:53,576
but his pulse
is very, very weak.

825
00:46:55,143 --> 00:46:57,814
John's brain, like his organs,

826
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,913
was deprived of oxygen
for at least 20 minutes

827
00:47:00,915 --> 00:47:03,285
before CPR was administered.

828
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:06,321
His injuries are catastrophic.

829
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:09,692
Beyond rudimentary
brain function...

830
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,895
I've never seen
a case like John's.

831
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:16,062
The fact that he's made it
this far...

832
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,267
I'm sorry.

833
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:18,665
"This far"?

834
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:19,803
Doctor?

835
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,708
If John ever
regained consciousness...

836
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:28,712
he'd be severely
neurologically impaired.

837
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:35,117
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

838
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:38,654
But I don't believe
John will survive the night.

839
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,324
If you have family and friends

840
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:46,129
that you want to call
to come to see John,

841
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:48,631
now would be the time to do it.

842
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,572
I've been told that you are
the best, Doctor Garrett.

843
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,544
I'm an expert
in my field, ma'am.

844
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,480
No, you're the best.

845
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,183
World renowned, in fact.

846
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:10,319
Or was I misinformed?

847
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:13,390
No, you were not.

848
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:16,258
I know that
you don't know my son,

849
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:20,763
but my John is a fighter
and he doesn't give up.

850
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:25,835
So, I need you to go
and be the best for John.

851
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:28,137
Nothing less.

852
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:31,507
And you just let God
do the rest.

853
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,318
Okay.

854
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:45,287
Okay.

855
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,187
It's been
real touch and go.

856
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:48,355
Can't tell us anything more?

857
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:49,792
Here they are.

858
00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:51,261
Hey, Melissa.

859
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,330
I'm so sorry, hon.

860
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,964
We headed over
the minute we heard the news.

861
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:59,635
What are they saying about John?

862
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:01,569
Well, I'm not gonna say

863
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,837
what the doctor
just tried to tell me,

864
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,272
because I refuse to accept it.

865
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:08,277
Because John is gonna
get through this.

866
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:11,277
Joyce,

867
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:12,913
I think you need
to be honest with yourself

868
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:14,183
about John's chances.

869
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:17,286
I am being honest
about his chances.

870
00:49:18,386 --> 00:49:21,289
You know, I'm gonna get back.

871
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,991
They're only allowing two people
in the room at a time.

872
00:49:23,993 --> 00:49:25,195
Brian?

873
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:27,094
Brian. Let's go.

874
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:28,962
Oh, you and Jason go.

875
00:49:28,964 --> 00:49:30,165
I'll hang back.

876
00:49:30,732 --> 00:49:33,135
- Are you sure?
- Yes, thank you.

877
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,424
How are the boys?

878
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:01,462
Well, the two Joshes
were released a few hours ago.

879
00:50:01,464 --> 00:50:04,668
They suffered some hypothermia,
but they're gonna be fine.

880
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,535
And John?

881
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:13,577
John is in
a very tough spot, honey.

882
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:15,844
But he's got a pulse,

883
00:50:17,312 --> 00:50:19,881
which is a lot more than
anyone thought possible.

884
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:22,819
Mom said it was
some kinda miracle.

885
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:24,453
Yeah.

886
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,257
Yeah, yeah...

887
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:32,494
I still don't know quite how
to put it into words.

888
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,600
His mom, she was so emotional,
she was praying and...

889
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,370
I still can't believe it.
He just...

890
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:43,739
He just came back to life.

891
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,843
So, John's gonna be okay?

892
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:50,846
Your dad's had
a long day, honey.

893
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:52,346
I know, but...

894
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,584
what do I tell the kids
in my class?

895
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:58,787
Well, honey, the truth is
nobody knows for sure.

896
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:04,427
Is there a chance John will
be back to school this week?

897
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:05,759
No, honey.

898
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:09,466
He's gonna be
at Cardinal Glennon until...

899
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:19,709
Honey, I don't think John
is gonna live much longer.

900
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:22,545
But you said
he came back to life.

901
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:23,879
I know.

902
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,846
For now, honey.

903
00:51:26,848 --> 00:51:28,049
Yeah, for now.

904
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,315
But it's...

905
00:51:29,317 --> 00:51:31,020
You know, it's complicated.

906
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,366
I got an update
from the hospital.

907
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:44,667
They, um...

908
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,570
They don't expect that boy
to make it through the night.

909
00:51:51,105 --> 00:51:52,741
That was something today, bud.

910
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:55,511
What you did.

911
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:58,314
Well, if Chief hadn't asked us
to double back,

912
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:01,015
never would've found him
in the first place.

913
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,285
Say what?

914
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:05,055
If you hadn't yelled for us
to go back.

915
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:07,388
I thought you were nuts.

916
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,755
I didn't yell at you guys.

917
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:12,025
No, I was knee-deep in trying
to help those other boys

918
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,029
not lose their fingers and toes.

919
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,669
I never heard it.

920
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:21,801
You're the one
who found him, Tommy.

921
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:23,471
I helped you fish him out,
but...

922
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:25,075
the rest was all you.

923
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:29,778
I heard a voice say "Go back."

924
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:33,982
So who was it?

925
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:36,685
It wasn't me.

926
00:52:42,457 --> 00:52:45,027
You're messing with me, Chief.

927
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:46,428
No.

928
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:48,362
I'm just sitting here
listening to you

929
00:52:48,364 --> 00:52:49,797
trying to sound humble,

930
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,634
which really doesn't suit you.

931
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:59,334
<i>What I witnessed today
was something quite remarkable.</i>

932
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,469
<i>Some might even call it
a miracle,</i>

933
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:04,173
<i>which is why I'm writing.</i>

934
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:06,105
<i>So that no matter what happens,</i>

935
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:09,446
<i>we will remember
what we witnessed today.</i>

936
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,129
My John made it
through the night.

937
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:04,364
Yeah, of course he did.

938
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:05,700
He's a fighter.

939
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,239
Oh, I did some investigative
research with Brian.

940
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:12,107
Two creams, one sugar.

941
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:13,409
Thank you.

942
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:16,044
And thank you for staying
the night, Jason.

943
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:21,649
What?

944
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:24,654
That's the first time
you've ever called me Jason.

945
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,721
I'm sorry.
I've been awful to you.

946
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:30,625
No! Come on.
What are you talking about?

947
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:34,428
Who doesn't love
a typed, two-page,

948
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,129
single-spaced,
anonymous complaint letter

949
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:37,297
about the worship band?

950
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:38,632
The rapper was a bit much.

951
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:39,935
Okay.

952
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,770
I grew up on hymns.

953
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:45,240
Wait, how'd you know it was me?

954
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:48,143
I didn't.

955
00:55:48,477 --> 00:55:49,844
So...

956
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,781
Listen, Joyce. The only reason I
switched up the music at church

957
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,382
is because I will do

958
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:57,719
absolutely everything
and anything,

959
00:55:57,919 --> 00:56:00,956
to get young people psyched
to go to church.

960
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,325
Kids like John, it's just...

961
00:56:03,591 --> 00:56:06,728
They need a little more cowbell,
you know?

962
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:10,933
Yeah, I see your point.

963
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,567
Oh, Paula must hate me.

964
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:15,805
No. No, she thinks
you're very...

965
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:17,806
spirited.

966
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:22,178
Why don't you go home
and see your family?

967
00:56:22,477 --> 00:56:23,810
Are you sure?

968
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:26,181
Yes, yes, of course.

969
00:56:26,781 --> 00:56:28,449
Good morning, everyone.

970
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,418
Morning.

971
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:31,118
Uh, call me if you need me
for anything.

972
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,323
- I'll be back real soon.
- All right. Thanks.

973
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:38,060
Uh, I just got the update
from Wendy.

974
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,899
I don't know how John
made it through the night.

975
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,605
But I'm glad I was wrong.

976
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:53,241
I am worried
about cerebral edema.

977
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:58,980
Like the rest of John's body,

978
00:56:59,547 --> 00:57:01,216
his brain's going
to wanna swell.

979
00:57:01,649 --> 00:57:03,651
I'm gonna keep John
in an induced coma,

980
00:57:04,218 --> 00:57:06,588
give his body a chance
to reverse course.

981
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:09,188
And we're gonna run a lot of
tests today. Okay?

982
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,127
It's imperative that we see
some kind of real proof

983
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:14,096
of brain activity in John.

984
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,632
Yeah.

985
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,402
At best, we have
a long road ahead.

986
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,872
And I'm not gonna lie to you.

987
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,040
We're in uncharted territory.

988
00:57:31,113 --> 00:57:33,647
A fourteen-year-old
St. Charles boy,

989
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:36,150
<i>who spent 15 minutes
trapped underwater,</i>

990
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,919
<i>after falling through the ice
on Lake Saint Louis,</i>

991
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:41,654
<i>is continuing to fight
for his life today.</i>

992
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:43,223
<i>On Monday,
after first responders,</i>

993
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:48,194
<i>recovered John Smith's
unresponsive and pulseless body,</i>

994
00:57:48,196 --> 00:57:51,263
<i>John was transported
to St. Joseph West Hospital,</i>

995
00:57:51,265 --> 00:57:55,101
<i>where the trauma team continued
life-saving CPR efforts,</i>

996
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:57,705
<i>for an additional 45 minutes.</i>

997
00:57:57,939 --> 00:58:02,544
<i>It was then, that after an hour
with no signs of life,</i>

998
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,413
<i>John's mother, Joyce, prayed.</i>

999
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:07,080
<i>And John got a pulse.</i>

1000
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:09,350
<i>John was then
quickly airlifted here</i>

1001
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:10,984
<i>to Cardinal Glennon Hospital,</i>

1002
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:13,687
<i>where we're told that
Doctor Garrett and his team</i>

1003
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:15,688
<i>are working around the clock,</i>

1004
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,357
<i>in an effort to save
John Smith's life.</i>

1005
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:21,895
<i>This is Kay Quinn reporting live
from Cardinal Glennon Hospital.</i>

1006
00:58:21,897 --> 00:58:22,898
Where's Jason?

1007
00:58:23,297 --> 00:58:24,933
<i>And in other news,
yesterday, protesters...</i>

1008
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,002
I sent him home.

1009
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:32,341
You missed Doctor Garrett
this morning.

1010
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,044
No, he came and found me.

1011
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:39,481
Brian, you didn't come back
last night.

1012
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:46,855
I can't see him like this.

1013
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:50,992
I can't be in this room...

1014
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:54,496
seeing him in this state.

1015
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:57,366
I'm sorry.

1016
00:58:59,734 --> 00:59:01,102
Um...

1017
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:02,835
If you need anything,

1018
00:59:02,837 --> 00:59:04,806
I'll just be
right down the hall.

1019
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:07,509
I'm not leaving.

1020
00:59:08,509 --> 00:59:09,745
Okay.

1021
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,482
Melissa thinks that everyone...

1022
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:15,815
is just waiting for John to die.

1023
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:16,852
That it's just...

1024
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,523
It's just taking longer
than they expected.

1025
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,092
- What do you think?
- I'm sorry but...

1026
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,026
I think she's right.

1027
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:29,129
I can see it in their face
and in everyone's face except...

1028
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:30,199
Mine?

1029
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:35,238
I believe God
can heal our son completely.

1030
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,507
I know you do.

1031
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,010
I know you do.

1032
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:52,488
Why did you have to sleep
at the hospital?

1033
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:54,587
Well...

1034
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:56,022
Remember how I told you

1035
00:59:56,024 --> 00:59:58,393
another word for "pastor"
can be "shepherd"?

1036
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:02,131
Well, shepherds look after
their sheep, right?

1037
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:05,199
Is that why you always tell Mom

1038
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,636
the people at church
are acting like sheep?

1039
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,839
Um...

1040
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,808
Let's try not to repeat that.

1041
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,180
No, uh, John's like a sheep
that's been injured.

1042
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:21,550
And this is a real thing,
this really happens sometimes.

1043
01:00:21,882 --> 01:00:23,817
Sometimes when a shepherd
finds a sheep

1044
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,551
that's been injured
in his pasture,

1045
01:00:25,553 --> 01:00:27,087
he'll actually pick him up,

1046
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:29,424
and he'll carry him
around his neck.

1047
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:30,791
Why?

1048
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,431
Well, so that the sheep
can hear his heartbeat, right?

1049
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,999
And the two can form a bond.

1050
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:41,469
So you're gonna carry John
around your neck?

1051
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,404
Well, not literally.

1052
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,138
Um...

1053
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,876
I think I'm butchering
this metaphor.

1054
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:50,009
You guys, your dad
is going to the hospital

1055
01:00:50,011 --> 01:00:51,310
to be by John's side.

1056
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:53,179
That way he can hear
your dad's voice

1057
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:54,984
and know
that your dad loves him.

1058
01:00:55,283 --> 01:00:57,152
'Cause that is what pastors do.

1059
01:00:57,386 --> 01:00:58,587
They love their people.

1060
01:00:58,853 --> 01:01:00,487
Why didn't you just say that?

1061
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:02,024
Like, yeah.

1062
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:06,462
I have no idea.
I don't know.

1063
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:07,926
Why don't you go
brush your teeth?

1064
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:09,795
I think your mom should be
the pastor, huh?

1065
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:10,897
Yup.

1066
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:13,468
Hey, hey, hey! Dishes?

1067
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:16,037
Oh, I know. Ooh, so rough.

1068
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:18,073
Thank you!

1069
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:26,882
Hey. What?

1070
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:31,553
If John dies...

1071
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:36,123
I mean, it's gonna destroy her.

1072
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:39,895
She believes without a doubt
that he'll survive.

1073
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,710
Tommy.

1074
01:01:55,076 --> 01:01:56,544
How you doing?

1075
01:01:57,245 --> 01:01:58,613
What's on your mind, Chief?

1076
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:00,615
The guys think that, uh...

1077
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:03,750
maybe you're still
a little shook up

1078
01:02:03,752 --> 01:02:05,254
about what happened
to the boy.

1079
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,256
I know what I heard.

1080
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,390
I believe you.

1081
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,591
A few feet over...

1082
01:02:11,526 --> 01:02:14,294
That lake is, like, 25 feet deep
or more, right?

1083
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:15,161
Yeah.

1084
01:02:15,163 --> 01:02:18,598
To find him like we did,
that fast?

1085
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,502
Million to one,

1086
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:21,137
best case.

1087
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,574
Anything like that
ever happen to you?

1088
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:28,277
No.

1089
01:02:31,946 --> 01:02:33,381
Well...

1090
01:02:33,982 --> 01:02:35,551
The way I figure it,

1091
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:38,219
it's either one of two things.

1092
01:02:39,654 --> 01:02:40,889
Either I'm nuts...

1093
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:43,058
Or God's talking to you.

1094
01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:46,094
Exactly.

1095
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:52,033
In which case...

1096
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:54,602
I got a big personal problem.

1097
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:56,672
What's that?

1098
01:02:57,506 --> 01:02:59,174
I don't believe in God.

1099
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,408
Joyce thinks that John

1100
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,277
is gonna walk out
of this hospital.

1101
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:04,747
What do you think?

1102
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:12,588
I have my doubts,

1103
01:03:13,788 --> 01:03:15,623
if that's what you're asking.

1104
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:19,194
That being said...

1105
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,297
I think it's possible.

1106
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:27,636
I've been researching
drowning cases,

1107
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:29,637
hundreds of them.

1108
01:03:31,406 --> 01:03:34,410
No one in John's situation
has ever survived.

1109
01:03:42,517 --> 01:03:44,085
I believe in God.

1110
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:51,026
But maybe that only goes so far
with something like this.

1111
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:56,297
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1112
01:03:58,232 --> 01:04:01,102
I have no idea what God
will do with John.

1113
01:04:03,038 --> 01:04:05,041
I mean, I have no idea.

1114
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:08,408
All that I know is
that I'm supposed to walk

1115
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,645
alongside you and Joyce
right now.

1116
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:17,185
Best case scenario...

1117
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:20,823
is that my son leaves here
severely brain-damaged.

1118
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:26,629
Could you handle that?

1119
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:49,584
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

1120
01:04:52,654 --> 01:04:54,353
<i>I just think
we should be focused</i>

1121
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:55,723
<i>on the patients we can
actually help. Right?</i>

1122
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:58,259
<i>That isn't your call or mine.
It's Doctor Garrett's.</i>

1123
01:04:58,493 --> 01:05:00,527
It is
neurologically impossible

1124
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,929
for the patient to change course
at this point.

1125
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:03,864
Be that as it may,

1126
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:05,531
our job is to meet
the needs of the patient,

1127
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:07,634
until Doctor Garrett
changes course

1128
01:05:07,636 --> 01:05:08,969
or the patient expires.

1129
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:11,103
But the cerebral blood flow scan

1130
01:05:11,105 --> 01:05:12,806
shows complete absence of...

1131
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:16,377
The patient's name is John.

1132
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:18,113
John Smith.

1133
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:19,881
Hello, I'm Doctor Lulu.

1134
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:22,250
Yeah.

1135
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,384
My colleagues and I were just
discussing your son's case.

1136
01:05:24,386 --> 01:05:25,851
Oh, I heard what
you were discussing.

1137
01:05:25,853 --> 01:05:27,055
We thought we were alone.

1138
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:28,556
Of course you did.

1139
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,024
But I'm here,

1140
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:32,594
and my son is right
in front of you.

1141
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:36,030
And my son can hear you
whether you believe it or not.

1142
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,267
So from now on,

1143
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,868
I don't want anybody

1144
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,471
saying anything negative
about his prognosis

1145
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:43,772
in this room.

1146
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,910
We will all speak life
over John.

1147
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:50,810
Do I make myself clear?

1148
01:05:50,812 --> 01:05:52,913
Mrs. Smith, we really
didn't mean to upset you.

1149
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,617
I said, do I make myself clear?

1150
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,418
Yes.

1151
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:57,652
Great.

1152
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:12,935
Are you okay?

1153
01:06:14,602 --> 01:06:15,570
No.

1154
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,471
If I'm honest,
my sugars are sky high,

1155
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:20,306
and I have a pounding headache.

1156
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:21,674
Okay, that's not good.

1157
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:22,509
Yeah.

1158
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:25,281
I need to go home
and get my insulin and I...

1159
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:26,915
Go.

1160
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:29,817
Look, Brian and I got this.
John's in stable condition.

1161
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:32,652
Maybe you can actually
get some rest.

1162
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:33,556
Okay.

1163
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,434
Sammy!

1164
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:48,169
I've missed you.

1165
01:06:48,368 --> 01:06:50,137
Oh, you must be starved.

1166
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:51,906
Let's get you something.

1167
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,959
Hey.

1168
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:54,062
He's stable.

1169
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:55,697
No real changes.

1170
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:58,534
Um...

1171
01:09:01,736 --> 01:09:02,737
I, um...

1172
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:06,073
I brought your Jordans
with me.

1173
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:10,546
I know no one's allowed
to touch them.

1174
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:13,448
But I just thought that maybe...

1175
01:09:18,586 --> 01:09:20,654
I can't wait to see you

1176
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:23,858
shoot those baskets
and run up and down the court

1177
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,493
again.

1178
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:30,832
You are my pride and joy, John.

1179
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:33,701
Do you hear your mother?

1180
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,640
And I love you to the moon.

1181
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:41,477
And don't you forget it.

1182
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:49,617
John?

1183
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:51,918
He just squeezed my hand!

1184
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,921
What?

1185
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:54,286
Seriously?

1186
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:55,322
Yes, absolutely.

1187
01:09:55,556 --> 01:09:58,093
John, can you do it again?
Can you squeeze my hand?

1188
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:01,994
Um, ask him something.

1189
01:10:01,996 --> 01:10:03,230
Uh, okay. Um...

1190
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:06,466
John, squeeze my hand if...

1191
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,801
Michael Jordan is
the best player of all time.

1192
01:10:08,803 --> 01:10:10,738
Show Pastor Jason
a thing or two.

1193
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:17,111
I don't know.

1194
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:19,014
LeBron is pretty amazing.

1195
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,950
I don't know, I don't think
he can do it, Mom.

1196
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:23,919
Grab his other hand.

1197
01:10:25,153 --> 01:10:27,954
Honey, squeeze my hand
for Jordan

1198
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:29,856
and Jason's for LeBron,
okay, baby?

1199
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:31,727
Come on, buddy,
you got this.

1200
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:35,764
The best player
of all time, son.

1201
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:37,866
Come on.

1202
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:47,472
- Yeah!
- I saw it!

1203
01:10:47,474 --> 01:10:48,542
- Yeah!
- I saw it!

1204
01:10:48,776 --> 01:10:53,181
Um, John, who was it who got
a record six NBA titles?

1205
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:58,418
Yeah!

1206
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,953
I feel you, John!

1207
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:02,621
And who was it who hopped down
to Miami for a second,

1208
01:11:02,623 --> 01:11:04,460
crushing his fans
to get that ring?

1209
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:07,927
He can hear us!

1210
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:10,061
He squeezed my hand. Joyce!
He squeezed my hand.

1211
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:11,998
Oh, my God.
We have to tell the doctors.

1212
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,901
Oh, hell yeah!

1213
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:15,468
I'm sorry.

1214
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,605
I get pumped.

1215
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:17,939
I'm going!

1216
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:27,082
It's Doctor Garrett, John.

1217
01:11:27,381 --> 01:11:29,949
Your mom tells me
that you can hear us.

1218
01:11:29,951 --> 01:11:31,086
Is that true?

1219
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:36,387
Tell the doctor, John.

1220
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:37,755
Greatest player of all time.

1221
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:39,557
Squeeze my hand for Jordan,

1222
01:11:39,559 --> 01:11:41,996
and the doctor's for LeBron.
Okay, baby?

1223
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,832
Doesn't have to be
a hard squeeze.

1224
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,669
Just let us know
you're there, John.

1225
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:53,075
Who won those
six NBA titles, buddy?

1226
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,345
My hand for Jordan.

1227
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,882
The doctor's hand for LeBron.
Okay, baby? You got this.

1228
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,224
I just squeezed your hand, John.

1229
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:12,928
You wanna just squeeze mine
right back?

1230
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:25,237
Phantom or, uh,
random muscle tics are normal.

1231
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:27,075
It wasn't random.

1232
01:12:28,175 --> 01:12:30,111
No, he was answering us.

1233
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:33,014
I know it can seem like that.

1234
01:12:56,336 --> 01:12:57,772
Hey, girls.

1235
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,643
- Hi, Mrs. J.
- Thanks for coming.

1236
01:13:02,676 --> 01:13:04,313
- Hi.
- Hi. Thanks for coming.

1237
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,117
Rieger, Josh,

1238
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:13,020
get your butts over here
and give me a hug.

1239
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:20,161
Listen, I'm so glad
you boys are okay.

1240
01:13:23,898 --> 01:13:25,632
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Smith.

1241
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,967
It's our fault
that John is in here.

1242
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:28,703
No.

1243
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:31,437
So what matters now is that
you're here to support John.

1244
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:34,140
It means the world
to his dad and me.

1245
01:13:34,142 --> 01:13:35,876
So thank you.

1246
01:13:36,277 --> 01:13:38,180
We brought cards that, um...

1247
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,413
people made for John.

1248
01:13:40,415 --> 01:13:41,783
Wow. This is...

1249
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,819
It's really wonderful.
Thank you.

1250
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:51,423
Could you hold these a sec?

1251
01:13:51,425 --> 01:13:52,794
Excuse me, boys.

1252
01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:54,028
Thank you.

1253
01:13:59,099 --> 01:14:00,231
There's no words.

1254
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:01,100
Listen.

1255
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:03,171
- I'm so sorry.
- Not another word.

1256
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:05,674
Cindy, it's not your fault.

1257
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:06,972
Sorry.

1258
01:14:06,974 --> 01:14:08,074
Why'd we go out there?

1259
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,374
I'm sorry.

1260
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:10,745
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

1261
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:14,015
What I wouldn't give to bench
that boy right now.

1262
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,486
Did you see the Facebook page
that we made for John?

1263
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:19,220
- No.
- It's gone viral.

1264
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,089
Wow!

1265
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:22,957
Oh, girls...

1266
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:25,460
This is so...

1267
01:14:25,693 --> 01:14:28,130
Oh, this is so wonderful! Wow!
Look at...

1268
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:30,163
these prayers and,

1269
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,530
I already did
my homework!

1270
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:32,830
We came
to be supportive, honey,

1271
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:34,232
and there's nothing left
for us to do here.

1272
01:14:34,234 --> 01:14:35,901
So we need to not overstay
our welcome.

1273
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,204
- I wanna stay longer!
- We need to go. Okay?

1274
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:40,505
Girls, look, we need
to be prepared for the fact,

1275
01:14:40,507 --> 01:14:43,411
that John is probably
not going to make it. Okay?

1276
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,744
I really don't think
you wanna be here for that.

1277
01:14:45,746 --> 01:14:47,780
- Mom!
- I know I don't.

1278
01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:51,717
Mrs. J, are you okay?

1279
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:52,852
Yeah.

1280
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:00,995
Can I have your attention?

1281
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:08,602
Just down that hall,

1282
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:11,139
do you know that John
is fighting for his life?

1283
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:12,771
Okay?

1284
01:15:12,773 --> 01:15:14,039
And so in this room,

1285
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:16,844
there is no negative talk
of any kind!

1286
01:15:18,211 --> 01:15:19,281
Nothing!

1287
01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:20,981
Okay?

1288
01:15:22,216 --> 01:15:23,218
Thank you.

1289
01:15:23,617 --> 01:15:25,187
Unreal.

1290
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:27,485
- You okay?
- Far from it!

1291
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:28,620
The nerve of these people!

1292
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:29,991
Let's talk.

1293
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,262
What's up?

1294
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:38,400
I'm worried about you.
I know you're angry.

1295
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:40,602
Yeah. Yeah, you're right, I am.

1296
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:43,537
The people in that room
are not your enemy,

1297
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:45,972
even if they don't say
exactly the right thing.

1298
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,409
Look, I support
what you said out there.

1299
01:15:49,175 --> 01:15:52,979
But the way you've spoken
to some of the staff, I just...

1300
01:15:53,313 --> 01:15:54,915
What, Brian? Say it.

1301
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:57,419
I need you to show them some...

1302
01:15:58,118 --> 01:15:59,286
kindness

1303
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:00,786
or decency.

1304
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:02,521
I'm fighting for my son's life!

1305
01:16:02,523 --> 01:16:03,892
We all are!

1306
01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:12,431
Everybody is doing their best
in an impossible situation.

1307
01:16:12,433 --> 01:16:15,837
If it wasn't for me, our son
wouldn't be alive right now!

1308
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,109
Wow, Joyce.

1309
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:28,183
You're my wife. I love you.

1310
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,981
But whatever happens,

1311
01:16:29,983 --> 01:16:32,453
I don't want you
to regret how you acted here.

1312
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,190
In my heart of hearts,

1313
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:41,462
I know that you don't want
that either.

1314
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:45,199
Grinding people into the ground
isn't gonna save our son.

1315
01:16:45,966 --> 01:16:49,036
I am begging you
to remember who you are.

1316
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:50,805
If not for me,

1317
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:53,308
for John.

1318
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:18,600
Hey.

1319
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:21,569
Wake up.

1320
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:23,668
Honey, it's time to wake up.

1321
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:24,938
Joyce, wake up!

1322
01:17:25,139 --> 01:17:27,039
My wife is diabetic.
I can't wake her!

1323
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:29,110
Okay. Call for a crash cart,
let's go!

1324
01:17:29,977 --> 01:17:31,846
Somebody give me a hand!

1325
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:42,288
I'm fine now.

1326
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:45,526
I think I just took too much
of my insulin last night.

1327
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:48,261
You slipped
into a diabetic coma.

1328
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:50,596
Her blood sugar
is up to 70, Doctor.

1329
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:51,864
Thank you, Nurse.

1330
01:17:51,866 --> 01:17:53,833
See? I'm fine.

1331
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,066
Joyce, you coded!

1332
01:17:55,068 --> 01:17:56,200
I need to see John.

1333
01:17:56,202 --> 01:17:58,204
You need to rest
for at least eight hours.

1334
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,672
I want to be with my son.

1335
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:00,940
I'm not asking, Joyce.

1336
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,609
You have Type 1 diabetes.

1337
01:18:02,876 --> 01:18:05,045
You're dehydrated,
emotionally fried,

1338
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:07,012
and you haven't slept for days.

1339
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:08,914
I need you here
for the long haul for John.

1340
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,917
Three hours, not eight.
Best and final.

1341
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:15,253
Joyce, I catch you in that room
in less than five hours,

1342
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:16,989
I'll have you
involuntarily committed

1343
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:18,290
and taken across the street.

1344
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:20,627
- You wouldn't.
- He would, with my blessing!

1345
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,063
Five hours, Joyce.

1346
01:18:22,362 --> 01:18:23,330
Make 'em count.

1347
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,387
It's really not a good time
right now.

1348
01:18:46,153 --> 01:18:47,554
Yeah, I know, Joyce.

1349
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,160
That's why I'm here.

1350
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:56,363
What you must think of me.

1351
01:18:57,831 --> 01:18:59,433
You know what?

1352
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,604
I think you are
the fiercest mama bear

1353
01:19:04,772 --> 01:19:06,174
that I've ever known.

1354
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,539
How is John?

1355
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,609
He's stable.

1356
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:22,690
So when I was 18,

1357
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:27,495
I gave my first son up
for adoption.

1358
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:30,598
I wasn't ready,

1359
01:19:32,099 --> 01:19:34,035
and my life was such a mess.

1360
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,438
I've never forgiven myself.

1361
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:38,806
I can't let it go.

1362
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,376
I can't go back.
I can't fix it.

1363
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:47,681
So I tell John how
to spend his allowance.

1364
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:50,548
Brian what tie he should wear.

1365
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:54,387
I insisted on naming our dog
"Sammy" for crying out loud.

1366
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:56,524
John and Brian wanted "Yoda."

1367
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,559
It's a pretty stupid name.

1368
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:00,459
Thank you.

1369
01:20:00,461 --> 01:20:02,860
Oh, and you,
I still wanna fix your hair.

1370
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:07,333
My whole life,
I have not stopped

1371
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:09,203
trying to control the outcome.

1372
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:16,611
I can't control this, can I?

1373
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,655
Joyce, why don't you let God
handle it?

1374
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:39,299
Well, looks like you're
allowed back upstairs again.

1375
01:20:40,568 --> 01:20:41,636
Yeah.

1376
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:45,340
Um, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna...

1377
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,410
get a breath
of fresh air outside.

1378
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:49,910
Okay, I'll tell everyone.

1379
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,312
Okay.

1380
01:21:03,523 --> 01:21:05,356
And I know
that You love John,

1381
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:07,528
just as much as I do.

1382
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:10,364
Maybe more.

1383
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:29,315
I'm sorry.

1384
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:30,819
I am a...

1385
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:34,288
I am a broken,

1386
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:36,657
desperate,

1387
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,192
woman full of pride.

1388
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:47,102
But I get it.

1389
01:21:49,403 --> 01:21:51,739
I have to let him go.

1390
01:21:59,846 --> 01:22:01,448
I know You love me.

1391
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:07,418
Whatever You have,

1392
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:12,626
for John, for Brian, for me,

1393
01:22:16,363 --> 01:22:19,433
I surrender. I surrender.

1394
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,966
Brian, is everything okay?

1395
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,768
I don't think so.

1396
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:07,580
John's fever just hit 104.

1397
01:23:07,848 --> 01:23:10,618
Now, John's had
two full days of propofol.

1398
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:14,855
And it's only meant to be
taken at most for 24 hours.

1399
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:16,621
I think that's why
his fever's spiking.

1400
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,222
You said the propofol
was needed

1401
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:19,825
to keep John
in an induced coma.

1402
01:23:19,827 --> 01:23:20,628
That's right.

1403
01:23:20,995 --> 01:23:24,364
We had no other choice but
to keep him deeply sedated.

1404
01:23:24,732 --> 01:23:27,368
My concern now,
with this raging fever,

1405
01:23:28,368 --> 01:23:29,802
is that the propofol

1406
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,038
and the heavy-duty antibiotics
we're giving him,

1407
01:23:32,406 --> 01:23:35,410
will cause permanent
organ damage.

1408
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:38,246
Then wake him up.

1409
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:42,847
Excuse me?

1410
01:23:42,849 --> 01:23:43,984
Wake John up.

1411
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:46,386
Take him off of everything

1412
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:49,756
and let our son
fight for his life.

1413
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:53,057
You just said
these things that he's on

1414
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:54,928
are making him worse.

1415
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,930
And even if John wakes up,

1416
01:23:57,364 --> 01:23:59,964
we know he'll probably
never live a normal life.

1417
01:23:59,966 --> 01:24:01,199
That's right.

1418
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:02,370
Okay.

1419
01:24:04,071 --> 01:24:05,707
So we wake him up.

1420
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,843
Okay.

1421
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,848
Let's start tapering him off
all medication.

1422
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:18,720
Tomorrow morning,
we wake him up.

1423
01:24:28,261 --> 01:24:30,197
I think we need to ask for help.

1424
01:24:30,697 --> 01:24:32,767
All the help that we can get.

1425
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,267
<i>We're hearing tonight
that another miracle</i>

1426
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:37,569
<i>is needed for John.</i>

1427
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:39,370
<i>He is still in a coma,</i>

1428
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:41,474
<i>and he is still fighting
for his life.</i>

1429
01:24:41,974 --> 01:24:43,808
<i>Joyce Smith, John's mother,</i>

1430
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:46,145
was unable to leave
her son's side.

1431
01:24:46,345 --> 01:24:49,179
<i>But the family's pastor,
Jason Noble,</i>

1432
01:24:49,181 --> 01:24:50,481
<i>is joining me here tonight,</i>

1433
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:52,116
<i>with something he'd like to say</i>

1434
01:24:52,118 --> 01:24:53,654
<i>on the family's behalf.</i>

1435
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:55,321
<i>Jason.</i>

1436
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:57,823
<i>We've reached
a critical juncture</i>

1437
01:24:57,825 --> 01:24:59,160
<i>in John's care.</i>

1438
01:24:59,693 --> 01:25:03,029
<i>So the Smith family
simply asks for one thing.</i>

1439
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:05,866
<i>So please pray for John.</i>

1440
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,569
<i>His mother, Joyce, believes
that God can do the impossible.</i>

1441
01:25:09,937 --> 01:25:14,675
<i>So we're asking Him
to do just that.</i>

1442
01:25:15,242 --> 01:25:16,542
<i>Thank you.</i>

1443
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,310
<i>So the Smith family
is in need</i>

1444
01:25:18,312 --> 01:25:20,079
<i>of your prayers tonight,</i>

1445
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:23,949
<i>as they face this
incredibly difficult ordeal.</i>

1446
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:26,183
<i>When we first reported
on John's story,</i>

1447
01:25:26,185 --> 01:25:27,852
<i>we got such an outpouring</i>

1448
01:25:27,854 --> 01:25:30,621
<i>of care and concern
from the community.</i>

1449
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:33,792
<i>His story continues
to touch so many lives.</i>

1450
01:25:33,794 --> 01:25:35,927
<i>And we are committed
to keeping you posted</i>

1451
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:37,297
<i>every step of the way.</i>

1452
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:41,535
<i>Our thoughts and prayers
are with you, John.</i>

1453
01:25:42,568 --> 01:25:45,937
<i>This is Kay Quinn reporting from

with the breath of life.

1457
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:18,236
Restoring him fully

Tommy?

1504
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:45,071
I just wanna thank you
for saving my son.

1505
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:51,879
I was just doing my job.

1506
01:30:57,684 --> 01:30:59,687
I hope he's gonna be okay.

1507
01:31:22,509 --> 01:31:24,008
I'm gonna give you guys
some privacy.

1508
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:25,310
This feels like a family thing.

1509
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,413
So I'm gonna be right down
the hall if you need me.

1510
01:31:27,846 --> 01:31:29,315
It is a family thing.

1511
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,153
So I think you should stay.

1512
01:31:37,056 --> 01:31:38,190
Yeah.

1513
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:39,794
Okay.

1514
01:31:42,595 --> 01:31:44,031
Is everybody ready?

1515
01:31:45,498 --> 01:31:46,599
Okay.

1516
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:49,170
Let's start with
the breathing treatment.

1517
01:31:51,304 --> 01:31:54,306
This is going to
help open his airways and lungs.

1518
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:56,810
And then we can remove
the breathing tube.

1519
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,845
We're gonna extubate John.

1520
01:31:59,112 --> 01:32:01,079
John's lungs
have partially collapsed,

1521
01:32:01,081 --> 01:32:03,013
so this next part
won't be easy.

1522
01:32:03,015 --> 01:32:04,548
Move back a little bit, okay?

1523
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:05,752
Okay.

1524
01:32:29,009 --> 01:32:30,609
Orderly.

1525
01:32:32,946 --> 01:32:35,379
- Is he okay? What is happening?
- Joyce!

1526
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:37,149
Let him hear
your voices.

1527
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:38,915
John, it's Mom and Dad.
We're here for you, son.

1528
01:32:38,917 --> 01:32:41,585
- Everything's okay. We're right here.
- John, we're right here.

1529
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:43,288
I love you. John?

1530
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:44,323
Oxygen.

1531
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:46,758
Starting the flow, Doctor.

1532
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:57,035
Hmm. Okay, all right.

1533
01:32:57,037 --> 01:32:58,703
All right, he's breathing
on his own.

1534
01:32:58,705 --> 01:33:00,672
Okay, let's get him the Narcan.

1535
01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:02,573
0.4 milligrams, please.

1536
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:09,914
This should kick-start
John into consciousness

1537
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:11,214
within the next few minutes,

1538
01:33:11,216 --> 01:33:13,053
and then we'll see
what we're dealing with.

1539
01:33:13,653 --> 01:33:14,888
Hey, hey.

1540
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:18,123
This went about as well
as humanly possible.

1541
01:33:18,457 --> 01:33:20,193
That was awful.

1542
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:24,297
- This is the process, Joyce.
- Okay.

1543
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,233
Now, we wait.

1544
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:42,816
John.

1545
01:33:44,684 --> 01:33:46,821
John, baby.

1546
01:33:49,822 --> 01:33:52,026
I need you to fight.

1547
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,296
John.

1548
01:34:21,487 --> 01:34:24,390
<i>You need to come back
to us now, John.</i>

1549
01:34:26,026 --> 01:34:28,295
<i>I need you to fight.</i>

1550
01:34:34,134 --> 01:34:36,470
<i>You can do it, John.</i>

1551
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:44,545
<i>You need to come back
to us now, John.</i>

1552
01:34:47,447 --> 01:34:51,318
<i>You have a purpose
and you are loved.</i>

1553
01:35:01,027 --> 01:35:03,397
<i>I need you to fight.</i>

1554
01:35:10,769 --> 01:35:12,070
John?

1555
01:35:12,072 --> 01:35:13,437
John?

1556
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:14,306
Oh, John!

1557
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:15,841
You're okay, John.

1558
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:19,079
- Hey, John.
- We're right here.

1559
01:35:19,545 --> 01:35:20,744
Everything's okay.

1560
01:35:20,746 --> 01:35:21,981
Hey, John.

1561
01:35:22,381 --> 01:35:24,348
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

1562
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:26,517
- You're okay, John.
- It's Mom and Dad.

1563
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:27,884
And everyone's here.

1564
01:35:27,886 --> 01:35:30,189
Everyone's here.
You had an accident.

1565
01:35:31,925 --> 01:35:33,494
Do you know who I am?

1566
01:35:35,828 --> 01:35:37,331
I love you.

1567
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:42,702
Ma.

1568
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:46,570
John.

1569
01:35:46,572 --> 01:35:47,938
I'm here.

1570
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:51,010
I'm right here.

1571
01:35:52,578 --> 01:35:54,247
I'm here, baby. I'm here.

1572
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:58,216
And in 1885, Douglass wrote

1573
01:35:58,218 --> 01:36:01,085
<i>Narrative of the Life
of Frederick Douglass.</i>

1574
01:36:01,087 --> 01:36:03,320
And it became
the preeminent example

1575
01:36:03,322 --> 01:36:05,022
of the literary genre known...

1576
01:36:05,024 --> 01:36:06,091
John is awake!

1577
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:07,859
His mom says he's talking.

1578
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:09,595
Guys, his mom says he's talking!

1579
01:36:10,997 --> 01:36:12,598
Oh, my gosh!

1580
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,132
John's awake!

1581
01:36:14,134 --> 01:36:16,567
John is awake! John is awake!
John is awake!

1582
01:36:19,372 --> 01:36:20,640
Oh, my God!

1583
01:36:23,743 --> 01:36:25,008
John is awake!

1584
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,413
John Smith is awake!

1585
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:31,652
<i>I repeat, John Smith is awake!</i>

1586
01:36:34,621 --> 01:36:35,786
Breathe.

1587
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:40,525
Again.

1588
01:36:46,733 --> 01:36:48,033
One more time.

1589
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:56,109
Your lungs are very clear.

1590
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,343
Your oxygen levels are up.

1591
01:36:59,345 --> 01:37:01,378
- Doctor Garrett?
- Yes?

1592
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,915
John's lung cultures came back
negative for bacteria.

1593
01:37:04,183 --> 01:37:05,917
Run them again, please.

1594
01:37:05,919 --> 01:37:07,554
Uh, I already did.

1595
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:12,723
Is that a good thing?

1596
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:14,825
That's a really good thing,
honey.

1597
01:37:14,827 --> 01:37:16,927
Wendy, would you
help young John

1598
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:18,262
with his breathing exercises?

1599
01:37:18,264 --> 01:37:19,733
Absolutely.

1600
01:37:21,033 --> 01:37:22,501
When Wendy's ready,

1601
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:24,134
I want you to breathe in deeply,

1602
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:26,170
so we can test
your lung capacity.

1603
01:37:26,172 --> 01:37:27,640
Whatever you need.

1604
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,577
"Whatever I need."

1605
01:37:31,678 --> 01:37:32,712
Joyce.

1606
01:37:43,188 --> 01:37:44,388
Forty-eight hours ago,

1607
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:47,527
John's lungs were filled
with his own blood.

1608
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:52,198
He needed constant adrenaline
just to keep his heart pumping.

1609
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:55,165
His white blood cells
were being consumed

1610
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:57,504
faster than any patient
I've ever seen.

1611
01:37:58,371 --> 01:38:02,774
His brain was experiencing
neurological devastation,

1612
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:06,447
while simultaneously every one
of his major organs...

1613
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,581
was failing.

1614
01:38:09,882 --> 01:38:11,184
Now, look at him.

1615
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:15,689
I'm a doctor.

1616
01:38:16,922 --> 01:38:18,559
I'm supposed to know better.

1617
01:38:20,093 --> 01:38:23,330
But there's simply
no other explanation, Joyce.

1618
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:30,370
Your son's a miracle.

1619
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,373
Thank you.

1620
01:38:41,782 --> 01:38:43,114
Surprise!

1621
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:46,017
Thank you.

1622
01:38:50,023 --> 01:38:51,725
Thank you.

1623
01:38:52,692 --> 01:38:54,194
Oh, my goodness.

1624
01:38:56,696 --> 01:38:57,797
What's that?

1625
01:38:59,799 --> 01:39:01,234
Oh, my God!

1626
01:39:01,434 --> 01:39:02,469
So cool!

1627
01:39:02,801 --> 01:39:04,468
Oh, I can't grip it yet.

1628
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:12,145
Hey, Abby.

1629
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:14,914
Hey, John.

1630
01:39:27,492 --> 01:39:30,393
Shut it, Chayla. Come on.

1631
01:39:30,395 --> 01:39:32,331
Two, one.

1632
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,004
Hey, John!

1633
01:40:16,908 --> 01:40:18,444
Welcome back, man!

1634
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:20,744
Whoo! John!

1635
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:24,749
Welcome back, John.

1636
01:40:24,751 --> 01:40:25,883
Thank you, Mrs. Abbott.

1637
01:40:25,885 --> 01:40:27,084
Thank you.

1638
01:40:31,957 --> 01:40:35,926
Okay, everyone,
let's turn to Chapter 19

1639
01:40:35,928 --> 01:40:37,360
in our history books.

1640
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:42,633
- Mrs. Abbott?
- Yeah.

1641
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:44,267
I know I have a lot
to catch up on.

1642
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:46,872
Oh, no, John.
Please, don't worry about it.

1643
01:40:47,607 --> 01:40:49,707
I'm just glad
to have you back.

1644
01:40:49,709 --> 01:40:50,777
Thank you.

1645
01:40:52,278 --> 01:40:53,410
Hey, John.

1646
01:40:53,412 --> 01:40:55,715
Uh, I was wondering,

1647
01:40:58,285 --> 01:40:59,853
Why do you think...

1648
01:41:00,685 --> 01:41:04,023
God chooses to save some
and not others?

1649
01:41:07,894 --> 01:41:09,029
It's just...

1650
01:41:10,196 --> 01:41:12,399
I lost my husband two years ago.

1651
01:41:13,366 --> 01:41:15,102
He had an aneurysm...

1652
01:41:17,303 --> 01:41:19,006
and died in his sleep.

1653
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:22,709
And I'm still trying
to figure it all out.

1654
01:41:26,712 --> 01:41:27,947
I'm so sorry.

1655
01:41:31,818 --> 01:41:32,986
No, I'm sorry.

1656
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,988
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1657
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:38,524
Clearly, I wasn't thinking.

1658
01:41:39,192 --> 01:41:41,959
Why don't you go and catch up
with the rest of your friends?

1659
01:41:41,961 --> 01:41:43,430
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

1660
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:39,385
What's up, Miracle Boy?

1661
01:42:39,685 --> 01:42:41,287
Where you running off to?

1662
01:42:42,054 --> 01:42:45,758
Not gonna go try and, uh, walk
on water again, are you, John?

1663
01:43:50,422 --> 01:43:51,690
Tommy?

1664
01:43:54,327 --> 01:43:55,695
Tommy Shine?

1665
01:43:56,828 --> 01:43:57,962
John?

1666
01:44:00,099 --> 01:44:01,464
It's good to finally meet you.

1667
01:44:01,466 --> 01:44:02,669
Yeah.

1668
01:44:03,068 --> 01:44:04,103
You too.

1669
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:17,117
I was just sitting here
debating on whether...

1670
01:44:17,649 --> 01:44:19,752
coincidences happen in life.

1671
01:44:25,257 --> 01:44:27,227
Thank you for saving me.

1672
01:44:30,496 --> 01:44:32,031
I didn't save you, John.

1673
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:36,635
I mean, I did, but I didn't.

1674
01:44:37,603 --> 01:44:39,473
In the water that day,

1675
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,308
I was ready to give up
on you, man.

1676
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:47,647
But then I hear this voice
telling me "Go back."

1677
01:44:48,848 --> 01:44:51,618
God told me where to find you.

1678
01:44:55,388 --> 01:44:58,225
Well, if there's a God...

1679
01:45:00,059 --> 01:45:02,060
I don't know what
he's got planned for you,

1680
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:04,797
but it must be something
pretty special.

1681
01:45:12,037 --> 01:45:14,107
Maybe that's true
for the both of us.

1682
01:45:19,511 --> 01:45:20,610
Way over there?

1683
01:45:20,612 --> 01:45:22,081
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh.

1684
01:45:24,416 --> 01:45:25,615
<i>Good morning!</i>

1685
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:26,718
<i>Good morning!</i>

1686
01:45:27,019 --> 01:45:29,856
We have a little bit of a
surprise for you this Sunday.

1687
01:45:30,956 --> 01:45:34,394
I'd like to ask
a good friend of mine,

1688
01:45:34,693 --> 01:45:39,329
Joyce Smith, and her family,
to join me up here.

1689
01:45:49,776 --> 01:45:51,575
We love you, John!

1690
01:45:59,885 --> 01:46:03,723
In all my years in ministry,

1691
01:46:04,556 --> 01:46:07,725
I mean, I've never
even seen anything

1692
01:46:07,727 --> 01:46:10,029
or heard of anything like this.

1693
01:46:11,897 --> 01:46:16,803
So, John, what do you remember?

1694
01:46:19,005 --> 01:46:21,105
This thing on?

1695
01:46:23,075 --> 01:46:24,044
Um...

1696
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:27,747
Well, I do remember waking up.

1697
01:46:30,616 --> 01:46:32,319
And the first thing I saw...

1698
01:46:34,118 --> 01:46:38,357
was my mom, holding my hand.

1699
01:46:42,761 --> 01:46:44,898
And letting me know that
everything was gonna be okay.

1700
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:50,970
When I was a baby,
and no one wanted me,

1701
01:46:52,104 --> 01:46:53,572
my parents wanted me.

1702
01:46:54,139 --> 01:46:56,374
And when no one thought
that I could make it back,

1703
01:46:56,742 --> 01:46:58,645
my mom knew that I could.

1704
01:47:01,413 --> 01:47:02,648
Mom...

1705
01:47:05,084 --> 01:47:06,219
I love you.

1706
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:08,721
I love you.

1707
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:10,890
Dad...

1708
01:47:12,224 --> 01:47:13,859
I love you, too.

1709
01:47:14,492 --> 01:47:15,961
I love you, John.

1710
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:27,107
And for those of you
who ask why me...

1711
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:32,143
I don't know.

1712
01:47:32,877 --> 01:47:35,014
But a great teacher
once told me,

1713
01:47:35,447 --> 01:47:37,383
"Yesterday's not ours
to recover,

1714
01:47:38,951 --> 01:47:42,154
"but tomorrow is ours
to win or lose."

1715
01:47:47,859 --> 01:47:50,129
Lastly, I just wanna
thank the Lord.

1716
01:47:53,299 --> 01:47:56,002
I thought it might be
a good idea for John

1717
01:47:56,402 --> 01:48:00,339
to meet some of the people
responsible for saving his life.

1718
01:48:01,005 --> 01:48:03,507
If you're part of the
Wentzville Fire Department,

1719
01:48:03,509 --> 01:48:04,944
would you please stand?

1720
01:48:08,846 --> 01:48:10,882
If you're
an emergency dispatch officer

1721
01:48:10,884 --> 01:48:12,548
or an EMT member,

1722
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:14,053
could you please stand
as well?

1723
01:48:15,254 --> 01:48:18,554
Now, if you're a member of the
Lake Saint Louis Police Department,

1724
01:48:18,556 --> 01:48:20,093
could you please stand?

1725
01:48:20,993 --> 01:48:23,194
If you're part of
the St. Joseph medical team,

1726
01:48:23,196 --> 01:48:24,261
could you stand?

1727
01:48:27,065 --> 01:48:29,432
And if you're part of the
Cardinal Glennon medical team,

1728
01:48:29,434 --> 01:48:30,769
could you stand?

1729
01:48:35,206 --> 01:48:39,677
Thank you so much
for your tireless service.

1730
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:41,078
For your sacrifice.

1731
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,678
If you could remain standing,

1732
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:43,946
I'd like to ask anyone

1733
01:48:43,948 --> 01:48:46,185
who prayed for John
at school to stand.

1734
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:51,991
I'd like anyone who prayed
for him at home to stand.

1735
01:48:57,029 --> 01:48:58,963
I'd like anyone
who prayed for him

1736
01:48:58,965 --> 01:49:01,234
in this very church to stand.

1737
01:49:13,746 --> 01:49:16,082
Thank you.
You can please be seated.

1738
01:49:20,818 --> 01:49:25,490
I think it's been said
that love...

1739
01:49:25,791 --> 01:49:31,898
is the most powerful force
on this earth.

1740
01:49:33,398 --> 01:49:37,402
And my husband and I,
we believe that...

1741
01:49:38,737 --> 01:49:40,838
without love,
we cannot flourish,

1742
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,308
we cannot grow.

1743
01:49:43,142 --> 01:49:46,845
We cannot find our place
in this world.

1744
01:49:47,446 --> 01:49:51,917
And the power of love,
and God's love especially,

1745
01:49:52,584 --> 01:49:54,185
is truly the one and only thing

1746
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:57,055
that makes all things possible.

1747
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:00,392
Thank you for loving John,

1748
01:50:01,126 --> 01:50:03,196
and thank you for loving us.

1749
01:50:03,696 --> 01:50:05,364
Thank you so much.

1750
01:50:06,431 --> 01:50:07,698
Thank you.

1751
01:50:15,273 --> 01:50:16,942
Whoo!

1752
01:50:26,986 --> 01:50:29,255
John! Eagle, eagle!

1753
01:50:29,554 --> 01:50:31,023
Eagle, eagle!

1754
01:51:57,333 --> 01:52:02,333
