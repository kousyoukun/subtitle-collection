1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,085
Hi. Welcome to the future.

2
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:39,630
San Dimas, California, 2688.

3
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,446
And I'm telling you, it's great here.

4
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,261
The air is clean. The water's clean.

5
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,555
Even the dirt is clean.

6
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,247
Bowling averages are way up.
Mini-golf scores are way down.

7
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,609
And we have more excellent waterslides...

8
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,148
...than any other planet
we communicate with.

9
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,068
I'm telling you, this place is great...

10
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,153
...but it almost wasn't.

11
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,907
You see, 700 years ago,
the two great ones...

12
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:08,096
...ran into a few problems.

13
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,911
So now I have to travel back in time
to help them out.

14
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:14,770
If I fail to keep these two
on the correct path...

15
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,168
...the basis of our society will be in danger.

16
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:20,297
Don't worry, it'll all make sense.
I'm a professional.

17
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,118
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

18
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:28,742
And I'm Ted... Hold on.
Bill, here, you take it.

19
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:30,098
Okay.

20
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:37,293
- And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.
- Yeah!

21
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,634
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

22
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,459
- Smell it, dude.
- Let's bail.

23
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,034
We blew it.

24
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,953
Guess we used too much power.

25
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:14,934
I liked it.

26
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:22,129
While I agree that, in time,
our band will be most triumphant...

27
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:25,153
...the truth is,
Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band...

28
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:27,238
...until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.

29
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:31,826
Yes, but I do not believe
we will get Eddie Van Halen...

30
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,495
...until we have a triumphant video.

31
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,623
It's pointless to have a triumphant video...

32
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,126
...before we even have decent instruments.

33
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,566
How could we have decent instruments
if we don't know how to play?

34
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,277
That is why we need Eddie Van Halen!

35
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,301
And that is why we need
a triumphant video.

36
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,638
Excellent!

37
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,415
- We're late!
- For what?

38
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:01,022
- For school, dude!
- Yeah.

39
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,388
Bill, I'm waiting.

40
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,724
He's dead?

41
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:21,877
What you're telling me, essentially,
is that Napoleon...

42
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,317
...was a short dead dude.

43
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,133
Yeah.

44
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,739
You totally blew it, dude.

45
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,242
- Ted, stand up.
- Stand up?

46
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:34,597
Yes, son. Stand up.

47
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,768
Now...

48
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,957
Who was Joan of Arc?

49
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:44,711
Noah's wife.

50
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,906
Listen, guys, don't forget:
tomorrow, final report...

51
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,784
...1:30 to 3:30, okay?

52
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:00,978
Guys.

53
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:05,566
Mr. Ryan...

54
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:10,675
Before you say anything,
my distinguished colleague, Ted, and I...

55
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:13,386
...wish to express to you our thanks...

56
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,514
...for all the things
we have learned in your class.

57
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,974
And what have you learned?

58
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,899
We've learned
that the world has a great history.

59
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:30,904
Yes. And that thanks
to great leaders such as...

60
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:34,032
...Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc...

61
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,080
...and Socratic Method...

62
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:39,871
...the world is full of history.

63
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:47,796
It seems to me the only thing
you've learned is that Caesar...

64
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,923
...is a "salad-dressing dude."

65
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,573
Bill, Ted, this is really quite simple.

66
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:57,075
You have flunked
every section of this class.

67
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:02,289
Now, unless you get an A plus
on your final oral report tomorrow...

68
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,147
...guys, I have no choice
but to flunk the both of you.

69
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:08,545
You know your topics.

70
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,716
So I would suggest
you at least cover those areas...

71
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,219
...if you want to pass the course.

72
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,827
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:19,807
Okay.

74
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:28,253
Your report
had better be something very special.

75
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:32,528
Man.

76
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,055
What are we supposed to know
for our report?

77
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,306
I'm not sure.

78
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,851
One thing I know is that
Joan of Arc is not Noah's wife.

79
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:47,543
- Then who is Noah's wife?
- I don't know, Ted.

80
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,922
But I do know we're in serious trouble.
Listen to this:

81
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,988
"Express to the class
how an important historical figure...

82
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,762
"... from each of your time periods...

83
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:01,307
"... would view the world
of San Dimas, 1988."

84
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:06,833
We're in danger of flunking
most heinously tomorrow.

85
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,795
- Hi, Bill. Want a ride?
- Sure, Missy.

86
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,089
I mean, Mom.

87
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,616
- Your stepmom is cute.
- Shut up.

88
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:22,056
Remember when she was a senior
and we were freshmen?

89
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,649
I'll be right back as soon as I get my books.

90
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:48,334
- What are you doing home, Dad?
- I'm looking for my keys.

91
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,835
You haven't done anything with them?

92
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:53,443
No, sir.

93
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,841
I spoke to your principal today.

94
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:59,073
- He said you're failing history.
- Me and Bill...

95
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:02,514
He also said that if you fail history,
you flunk out of school.

96
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:06,685
You know what that would mean,
don't you?

97
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:11,168
That I would have to go
to Oates Military Academy, sir.

98
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,505
I spoke to Col. Oates this morning.

99
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,197
He's anxious to meet you.

100
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:38,487
Dude, we gotta pass,
otherwise there's no more band.

101
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:42,762
- Why?
- My dad's sending me to military school.

102
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,639
Where?

103
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,350
Alaska.

104
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:50,374
Alaska.

105
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:01,427
It is time. Their separation is imminent.

106
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,021
Be excellent to each other.

107
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,461
Party on, dude.

108
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:07,221
Okay, Ted, George Washington.

109
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,332
- One: the father of our country.
- Two: born on Presidents' Day.

110
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:15,355
Three: the dollar-bill guy.

111
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:18,587
You ever made
a mushroom out of his head?

112
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,047
Alaska.

113
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,280
Okay.

114
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:29,119
Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.

115
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,247
That's Capt. Ahab, dude.

116
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,209
Wait. Remember Disney World?

117
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,963
- Hall of Presidents?
- Yeah, good. What did he say?

118
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:43,508
"Welcome to the Hall of Presidents."

119
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,679
Hi. I brought you guys some food.

120
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,546
It's your mom, dude.

121
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,736
How's it going?

122
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,239
Bad.

123
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:10,618
We're destined to flunk
most egregiously tomorrow.

124
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,310
And I am destined to end up
at Oates Military Academy.

125
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,230
And then we will never start our band.

126
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,505
Good.

127
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:31,786
- What are you guys studying, anyway?
- History.

128
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,141
Mr. Ryan?

129
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,435
Tell him hi.

130
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,668
Why don't you guys take a dinner break?

131
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,379
Thanks, Dad.

132
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,792
Now your dad is going for it
in your own room.

133
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,043
Shut up.

134
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:03,969
- Your stepmom is cute, though.
- Shut up.

135
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:07,342
- Remember when I asked her to the prom?
- Shut up!

136
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:13,389
1275.

137
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:18,395
Okay, the lady in that car over there...

138
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,940
...said that Marco Polo was
in the year 1275.

139
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:25,277
It's not just a water sport. I knew it.

140
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,655
Excuse me.
When did the Mongols rule China?

141
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:32,575
I don't know. I just work here.

142
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,708
- You want to try the Thrifty Mart?
- Sure.

143
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:04,692
Not bad.

144
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,886
Greetings, my excellent friends.

145
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,744
Do you know
when the Mongols ruled China?

146
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:20,019
Perhaps we can ask them.

147
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,754
Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

148
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,611
And Ted "Theodore" Logan.

149
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,906
Gentlemen...

150
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,617
I'm here to help you
with your history report.

151
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:38,266
- What?
- How?

152
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:42,958
I hate that part.

153
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:46,399
- Bill.
- What?

154
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:49,944
Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.

155
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:59,016
Dudes, you guys are going to
go back in time!

156
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:03,916
You are going to have the most excellent
adventure through history.

157
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:07,461
- Who are you guys?
- We're you, dude!

158
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,338
No way.

159
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:12,311
- No way.
- Yes way!

160
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:14,553
We know how you feel.

161
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:17,629
We didn't believe it either
when we were you...

162
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,183
...and we-us said
what we-us are saying right now.

163
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,644
Okay, wait.

164
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,563
If you guys are really us...

165
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,421
...what number are we thinking of?

166
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,653
Sixty-nine, dudes!

167
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:43,019
- Look, dudes, we gotta go.
- Yeah, we gotta get back to the report.

168
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:44,374
Rufus!

169
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,962
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

170
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:52,820
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

171
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:56,052
- Who?
- You'll see.

172
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,702
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

173
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:02,726
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed...

174
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:06,271
Don't forget to wind your watch!

175
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:11,067
Thanks, Rufus.

176
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,300
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

177
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,897
Dude, are you sure
we should be doing this?

178
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:32,860
Ted, you and I have witnessed
many things...

179
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,719
...but nothing as bodacious
as what just happened.

180
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,638
Besides, we told ourselves
to listen to this guy.

181
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,662
What if we were lying?

182
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,250
Why would we lie to ourselves?

183
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:54,862
How are you going to help us?

184
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,573
Yeah, are you going to call someone
and get the answers?

185
00:16:57,676 --> 00:17:00,805
Gentlemen, we're going to do
a lot more than that.

186
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,393
Excellent.

187
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,981
Brace yourselves, amigos.

188
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,512
Gentlemen...

189
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:23,431
We're history.

190
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:35,318
Rufus, where are we, dude?

191
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,134
These are the circuits of history,
gentlemen.

192
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:41,053
They'll take us
to any point in time we wish.

193
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:42,200
How?

194
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:45,328
Modern technology, William.

195
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:07,330
- That was most unprecedented, Rufus.
- Yeah.

196
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,084
But where are we, Rufus?

197
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:14,733
Austria, 1805.

198
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,340
The French have just invaded.

199
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,345
Bill, check it out!

200
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,682
We're in the middle of a war, dude!

201
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,904
Amigos, time to depart.

202
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:45,389
How's it going, dude?

203
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,675
Now where are we, dude?

204
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:24,907
It's my house.

205
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:29,495
Rufus, can we go
anywhere we want at any time?

206
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,440
You can do anything you want...

207
00:19:31,476 --> 00:19:34,083
...as long as you remember this:
No matter what happens...

208
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:37,003
...you must get to that report. Got it?

209
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:38,984
All right, amigos...

210
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:42,216
...that book will give you the number
of anyplace you want to go.

211
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,663
Now, most important,
no matter what you do...

212
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,392
...no matter where you go,
that clock, the clock in San Dimas...

213
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,478
...is always running.

214
00:19:53,514 --> 00:19:54,833
- Got it?
- Yeah.

215
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:57,335
All right, time for me to go.

216
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:00,880
- What do you mean, Rufus?
- Yeah, aren't you coming with us?

217
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,800
Gentlemen, you're on your own.

218
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:20,379
- Ted?
- What?

219
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:23,819
This has been a most unusual day.

220
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:36,333
- It's Napoleon.
- Who?

221
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:39,983
The short dead dude
from our history review.

222
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:43,424
I have a most excellent idea.

223
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,448
Grab his legs. We gotta get him inside.

224
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:50,305
I think I figured out
a way to pass our report.

225
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,520
How?

226
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:55,936
We got one historical figure here,
maybe we can go back and get more.

227
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,604
Yeah.

228
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,045
Deacon, you have to watch this guy.

229
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:05,633
His name is Napoleon.
He is a very famous French dude.

230
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:08,553
We've decided to collect
other important figures from history...

231
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,429
...for an oral report we are doing.

232
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:14,183
While we are gone,
you are not to let him out of your sight.

233
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:18,041
Here is some money.
Take him to the movies or something.

234
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:26,904
Napoleon?

235
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,719
I am Bill.

236
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:34,516
We'll take you back to France after
you tell us what you think of San Dimas.

237
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:38,270
- This is Ted's little brother, Deacon.
- Hi.

238
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:39,938
He'll take care of you.

239
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:46,298
- Ready, Ted?
- Ready, Bill.

240
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:48,802
Let's go back into history.

241
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:55,579
This should be most triumphant.

242
00:21:56,622 --> 00:21:58,812
I want to speak with you, son.

243
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,418
Alone, please, Bill.

244
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,319
All right, sit down.

245
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,220
What am I going to do with you?

246
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,471
Great.

247
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,703
You lose my keys, you fail history.

248
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,101
You spend all your time
with your loser friend...

249
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,150
...planning a band that will never happen.

250
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:23,732
You're not to leave this house
until tomorrow morning.

251
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:28,424
Yes?

252
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:32,908
Capt. Logan, this is Dep. Van Halen
down at the station.

253
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,993
Dep. Van Halen?

254
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:40,832
I'm new, dude... sir.

255
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,064
Look, we found your keys...

256
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,506
...and if you want them,
you better come and get them.

257
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:55,638
When I get back from the station,
I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?

258
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,710
We are in serious trouble.

259
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:08,152
My dad already signed me up.
My plane leaves tomorrow night.

260
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:11,176
That's only if we fail, dude.

261
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:17,327
No way!

262
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:22,958
Okay, we got Sigmund Frood,
Beeth Oven...

263
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:27,234
Is there one for the Western Movement
in America in the 19th century?

264
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,214
Yeah.

265
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,299
Well, then...

266
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,157
Let's reach out and touch someone.

267
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:26,563
How's it going, Old West dude?

268
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:31,152
This is just like Frontierland.

269
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:34,071
Yeah, but you can get shot here.

270
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:38,242
- So just try to act natural.
- Okay.

271
00:24:41,787 --> 00:24:43,627
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy.

272
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:47,209
- Watch out for the horse crap.
- Thanks, dude.

273
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,024
- I'm totally thirsty.
- Me, too.

274
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,228
Two beers, please.

275
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:17,864
- He didn't even card us, dude.
- Yeah, we'll have to remember this place.

276
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,727
Who should we take with us?

277
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:40,282
- Who's he?
- He's Billy the Kid.

278
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:45,078
He's famous, dude. Let's bag him.

279
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,667
I need two men.

280
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:52,899
Who's with me?

281
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:55,611
We're with you, Billy the Kid.

282
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:08,749
Here's the deal. What I win, I keep.

283
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,503
What you win, I keep.

284
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:15,422
Sounds good, Mr. The Kid.

285
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:34,608
Dude, you've got to have
a poker face like me.

286
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:41,490
Three aces!

287
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:45,347
What the hell's going on here, Billy?

288
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:48,997
Are you a-cheatin' us, Kid?

289
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:53,898
Cheating? Me?

290
00:27:12,772 --> 00:27:14,023
Excellent!

291
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:26,535
Look, we're totally weak.
We can't possibly fight you.

292
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:30,497
However, how would you gentlemen like...

293
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:35,711
...free passes to Waterloo,
home of excellent waterslides?

294
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,214
Nice try, dude.

295
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:53,854
Come on.

296
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:59,067
- Look.
- It's the Goodyear blimp.

297
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:08,555
I can't believe they fell for that.

298
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:14,916
- Let's get 'em!
- Let's kill them!

299
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:18,252
Come on!

300
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:22,475
- You guys saved my life.
- Nothing doing, Billy the Kid.

301
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:25,448
- Where are we going?
- The golden age of civilization.

302
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,810
- Where?
- Ancient Greece, dude.

303
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:31,079
Don't worry, we'll bring you back
as soon as you talk at our report.

304
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:33,895
What?

305
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:09,972
Socrates?

306
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,976
- We know that name.
- Yeah. Look him up.

307
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:18,000
It's under "So-crates."

308
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:19,669
Yeah.

309
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:24,674
"So-crates:

310
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:26,863
"'The only true wisdom...

311
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:29,991
"'...consists in knowing
that you know nothing."'

312
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,162
That's us, dude!

313
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,830
Yeah!

314
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:38,333
- Let's bag him.
- Yeah.

315
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,956
How's it going?

316
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:08,990
I'm Bill. This is Ted.
We're from the future.

317
00:30:11,388 --> 00:30:12,847
Socrates.

318
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:15,976
Now what?

319
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:18,895
I don't know.

320
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:22,023
Philosophize with him.

321
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:32,554
"All we are is dust in the wind," dude.

322
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:41,730
Dust.

323
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:44,754
Wind.

324
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:46,005
Dude.

325
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,499
Let's get out of here, dude.

326
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:11,239
All right!

327
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:19,164
Not bad, eh, So-crates?

328
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:24,690
- Where are we, dude?
- England, 15th century.

329
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:27,781
We are in most excellent shape
for our report.

330
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:30,529
Yeah, all we need is one
more speaker from Medieval.

331
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,885
Excellent.

332
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:35,638
Billy, you are dealing with
the oddity of time travel...

333
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:37,724
...with the greatest of ease.

334
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:40,330
Excuse me.

335
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:43,197
Do you know where
there are any personages...

336
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,648
...of historical significance around here?

337
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:54,406
Check it out!

338
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:58,473
Must be the castle of King Henry.

339
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:00,663
Let's go, dude!

340
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:04,521
Billy, guard the booth.

341
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:07,127
And watch So-crates.

342
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,157
Who should we get for Medieval?

343
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,535
How about that gnarly old goat dude?

344
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:25,376
I'm in love, dude.

345
00:32:32,257 --> 00:32:36,742
Those must be the princesses
you told yourself about at the Circle K.

346
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,267
We gotta go.
It's a history report, not a babe report.

347
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,353
But, Bill...

348
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,586
Those are historical babes.

349
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,818
Okay.

350
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,406
You're the ladies' man.
How are we gonna meet them?

351
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:06,249
Excellent!

352
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:16,781
- Bill.
- What?

353
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:19,075
- These are heavy.
- Yeah.

354
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:20,639
Heavy metal.

355
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:29,606
- We better go find the princesses.
- Yeah.

356
00:33:30,857 --> 00:33:32,109
Watch it!

357
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:35,028
Who turned out all the lights?

358
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:38,782
- What?
- I'm Darth Ted.

359
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:44,621
I'm Luke Bill.
And you're not my father! No!

360
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,167
Come on!

361
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,546
Beat you, I will, yes!

362
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:01,201
- I totally conquered you, dude!
- No way!

363
00:34:01,827 --> 00:34:02,974
Come on!

364
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,249
I'll never rule the universe with you!

365
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:10,898
- Bill!
- What?

366
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:13,817
- We totally know how to sword fight!
- Yeah!

367
00:34:41,136 --> 00:34:43,847
Search the castle! There might be more!

368
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:20,239
Get out of here!

369
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:27,225
Bogus.

370
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:30,978
Heinous.

371
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,922
Most non-triumphant.

372
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,723
Don't be dead, dude.

373
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,339
You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!

374
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,929
Ted! You're alive!

375
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:29,266
Yeah! I fell out of my suit
when I hit the floor.

376
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:33,332
Fag!

377
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:37,294
Dude, you totally boned that dude
in the head!

378
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,692
He's a total bonehead!

379
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:43,655
He's a fat old man. There must be a way
to escape before the night falls.

380
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:45,011
But how?

381
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,617
What's that?

382
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,934
Those boys. I can't believe they're here.

383
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,627
How's it going, ladies?

384
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,693
You're the ones
we saw in front of the castle.

385
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:07,116
I am Ted of San Dimas.

386
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:12,016
And I bring to you a message of love.

387
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:15,770
From who?

388
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:19,315
From myself.

389
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:22,130
And what is this message you speak of?

390
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:28,283
Lyrics, dude. Recite them some lyrics.

391
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:35,685
O you beautiful babes from England...

392
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,501
...for whom we have
traveled through time...

393
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:42,359
...will you go to the prom with us
in San Dimas?

394
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:44,758
We will have a most triumphant time.

395
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:47,260
Way to go, dude.

396
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:50,180
It's Father!

397
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,754
What does your father want?

398
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:04,361
We're to be married to
two horrible old men today.

399
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:05,611
No way!

400
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:08,427
Will you help us escape?

401
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,033
Of course, babes.

402
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:18,645
How's it going, royal ugly dudes?

403
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:24,693
I'm the Earl of Preston.

404
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:28,655
And I am the Duke of Ted.

405
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:44,609
Put them in the iron maiden.

406
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:48,362
Iron maiden? Excellent!

407
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:50,970
Execute them.

408
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:53,681
Bogus.

409
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:57,225
We'll save you, babes!

410
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,900
Witches! Heretics! I saw them!

411
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:06,090
They fell from the sky!

412
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:07,757
Heretics!

413
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:10,573
They fell out of the sky!

414
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:15,161
They had fire in their eyes
and they had horns!

415
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,318
Off with their heads!

416
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,346
- Bill?
- What?

417
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:39,352
I believe our adventure through time
has taken a most serious turn.

418
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,594
- Billy!
- So-crates!

419
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:54,366
Let's go!

420
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:58,015
Guards! After them!

421
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,518
- So-crates!
- Bye, babes!

422
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,584
Catch you later, evil dudes.

423
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,713
Kill them! Guards!

424
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:17,618
Hurry up!

425
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,225
Out of the way!

426
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:07,251
Dial fast, dude!

427
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:13,091
The number you have
dialed is not in service at this time.

428
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:16,114
Please check your directory and dial again.

429
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,470
Party on, dude.

430
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:25,812
Okay, I got one! Let's go!

431
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:01,995
You guys stay here.

432
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:06,791
Where are we, dude?

433
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,294
I don't know.

434
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:15,341
- Sure do play excellent music.
- Most outstanding.

435
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,801
- It's you.
- Yeah. It's us.

436
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,512
Who are we?

437
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,900
I think they want us to say something.

438
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:36,985
What should I say?

439
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:40,009
Make something up.

440
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:50,748
Be excellent to each other.

441
00:43:57,421 --> 00:43:59,090
Party on, dudes.

442
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,697
Good one, dude.

443
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:10,352
Got to get back to our report.

444
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:14,417
Yeah. We'd take you with us,
but it's a history report...

445
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:16,190
...not a future report.

446
00:44:19,631 --> 00:44:20,883
Later.

447
00:44:21,822 --> 00:44:23,073
Later.

448
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,642
- Let's get back and do our report.
- Good idea.

449
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,956
- Dude! Where are we going?
- I don't know! I think the booth's broke!

450
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,605
We've got to keep dialing San Dimas
until we get back and get Napoleon.

451
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,506
Behold.

452
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:01,965
The Zyggie Pig.

453
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,720
The single greatest ice-cream spectacle
known to man.

454
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:10,203
"Eat the Pig, eat the Pig,
zyggie, zyggie, zyggie, zyg!"

455
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,730
Embetants!

456
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:19,900
It's ice cream.

457
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:22,298
You eat it.

458
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:24,696
It's good.

459
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,033
La glace.

460
00:45:29,284 --> 00:45:30,639
Whatever. Just eat it.

461
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,850
All behold!

462
00:45:52,955 --> 00:45:56,812
- He ate the Pig, thus proving that he's...
- A...

463
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:59,941
"Zyggie piggy!"

464
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:19,126
What's that?

465
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:24,548
I don't know.

466
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,221
Shit!

467
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:56,142
Where did we land now?

468
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,374
Dude, it's Sigmund Frood.

469
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:01,982
How much time we got left?

470
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:04,172
Tons. Why?

471
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:06,674
Extra credit, dude.

472
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,200
How's it going, Frood dude?

473
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:25,130
What is this? Let go of me.
What are you doing?

474
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:07,359
Was? Was ist los?

475
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:09,653
Come on, So-crates.

476
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,581
Welcome aboard, Miss Joan of Arc.

477
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:04,395
My name is Ted and this is Bill.

478
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:34,009
Want a Twinkie, Genghis Khan?

479
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:35,885
Say please.

480
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:40,578
Come on, guys. Jump him!

481
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:46,521
Candygram!

482
00:49:57,783 --> 00:49:59,451
Yes, what can I...

483
00:50:07,062 --> 00:50:11,025
We've got plenty of time,
but we don't have any more room left.

484
00:50:11,129 --> 00:50:13,319
- Ted, we're out of control.
- What?

485
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:14,570
Next place we stop...

486
00:50:14,674 --> 00:50:18,220
...we gotta try and figure out
what's wrong with the booth.

487
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,959
Bill, I think I got an idea what's wrong.

488
00:50:29,272 --> 00:50:30,419
What?

489
00:50:30,836 --> 00:50:32,609
The antenna's broken.

490
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:42,932
Yeah. All right.

491
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:13,171
Attends.

492
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:18,802
Cr�tin.

493
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,091
Come on, let's ditch him.

494
00:51:43,722 --> 00:51:46,120
Attends!

495
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:49,040
Attends!

496
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:55,191
- Excusez-moi, monsieur.
- Hold on there. Not so fast, buddy.

497
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:58,319
- "Buddy"?
- You ain't paid yet.

498
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:01,030
- Pay?
- Pay.

499
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,538
I don't want to see
you around here anymore! Beat it!

500
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:11,874
- Vous me connaissez, monsieur?
- Beat it, buddy!

501
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,585
Idiot!

502
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:32,729
Deacon!

503
00:52:42,948 --> 00:52:47,014
Here is a treat to make
our minor prehistoric pit stop...

504
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,517
...a bit more enjoyable.

505
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:52,645
Why, thank you.

506
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:22,883
Thanks, guys.

507
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,096
I sure hope this works.

508
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,780
I think it's working, dude.

509
00:53:57,711 --> 00:54:00,734
Just a little farther, I hope.

510
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:12,412
That's us. We're back in San Dimas!

511
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:16,479
Yeah. Only now it's not now,
it's last night.

512
00:54:16,896 --> 00:54:17,834
Dude.

513
00:54:17,939 --> 00:54:20,754
- What?
- Let's go talk to ourselves.

514
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,177
Excellent.

515
00:54:22,214 --> 00:54:26,697
- What did we say, anyways?
- I don't know. Let's go find out.

516
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:29,513
Sixty-nine, dudes!

517
00:54:33,058 --> 00:54:35,038
Look, dudes, we gotta go.

518
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:41,086
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

519
00:54:41,123 --> 00:54:45,466
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

520
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:48,802
- Who?
- You'll see.

521
00:54:50,262 --> 00:54:52,765
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

522
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:56,310
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed for San Dimas...

523
00:54:56,414 --> 00:54:59,126
...brought us here
instead of to tomorrow, Rufus?

524
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,254
Because in San Dimas
it is tomorrow, William.

525
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:04,756
You have to dial one number higher.

526
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,406
Yeah. Thanks, Rufus.

527
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:11,117
And hurry,
because you don't have much time.

528
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:14,141
What do you mean, Rufus?
We got 10 hours left.

529
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,956
You got two hours.

530
00:55:17,582 --> 00:55:22,586
Ted, you forgot to wind your watch again.
And after you reminded yourself not to.

531
00:55:22,796 --> 00:55:27,696
I better remind myself again.
Don't forget to wind your watch!

532
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:30,929
Thanks, Rufus.

533
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:34,995
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.

534
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:39,061
That conversation
made more sense this time.

535
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,190
- Watch the gonads, dude.
- Abe, you're too tall, man.

536
00:55:42,503 --> 00:55:44,796
That's just the way I'm built.

537
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:56,266
Great, we made it!

538
00:55:57,622 --> 00:56:00,958
Who's the senorita? She's cute.

539
00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:02,731
It's his mom, dude.

540
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,423
Hi, guys.

541
00:56:07,527 --> 00:56:09,508
Hi, Missy, I mean, Mom.

542
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,930
Miss Preston,
we'd like you to meet some of our friends.

543
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:18,267
Yeah, this is Dave Beeth Oven.

544
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:20,562
Sie sind so schon, Madame.

545
00:56:20,665 --> 00:56:24,524
And Maxine of Arc, Missy.

546
00:56:25,671 --> 00:56:27,235
Herman the Kid.

547
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:29,425
Bob Genghis Khan.

548
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,552
So-crates Johnson.

549
00:56:33,074 --> 00:56:34,742
Dennis Frood.

550
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,410
And...

551
00:56:39,122 --> 00:56:40,685
Abraham Lincoln.

552
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:45,378
It's nice to meet you all.
There are sodas in the fridge.

553
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,236
Can you give us a ride someplace?

554
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,468
Bill, I'm not taking you anywhere
until you do your chores.

555
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:30,631
Done!

556
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:34,802
This is the San Dimas Mall...

557
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:38,140
...and this is where
people of today's world hang out.

558
00:57:39,182 --> 00:57:41,997
All right, everybody,
watch your step getting off.

559
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:44,813
Beeth Oven,
make sure you don't get sucked under.

560
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:50,443
Everybody get together.
Remember who your buddy is.

561
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:54,093
So-crates, watch out for your robe, dude.

562
00:57:56,804 --> 00:57:57,846
Okay.

563
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:00,558
Follow me.

564
00:58:00,661 --> 00:58:03,998
You got your Broadway down here,
you got your Sears over here.

565
00:58:04,624 --> 00:58:08,899
The stratification of our society
is much like Marie-Antoinette's.

566
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:10,463
The few possess much...

567
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,216
...while the masses possess little
but their television sets.

568
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:16,614
This dichotomy led to a revolution...

569
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,639
...in which Antoinette
and her husband were beheaded.

570
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:22,350
Today, leaders are impeached
rather than beheaded.

571
00:58:23,288 --> 00:58:27,772
Still, while in her day, Marie-Antoinette
said, "Let them eat cake..."

572
00:58:27,876 --> 00:58:31,004
...perhaps today she'd say,
"Let them eat fast food."

573
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:40,493
- Enjoy!
- Okay, look around. See what you think.

574
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:43,308
We'll be back as soon as
we find Napoleon, okay?

575
00:58:44,142 --> 00:58:46,644
Come on, dude. We don't got much time.

576
00:58:46,749 --> 00:58:48,834
Yes, but what do we eat?

577
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:51,128
You ditched Napoleon?

578
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:56,028
Do you realize you've stranded one of
Europe's greatest leaders in San Dimas?

579
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:57,073
He was a dick!

580
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,641
How are we going to find him?

581
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:07,604
Okay, wait.

582
00:59:08,438 --> 00:59:11,566
If we were one of
the greatest generals in history...

583
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:14,903
...and we were stranded
in San Dimas for one day...

584
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:17,509
...where would we go?

585
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:22,514
Waterloo!

586
00:59:35,756 --> 00:59:39,093
Eleven children, please. Are you okay?

587
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:44,932
We're going.

588
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:47,539
Come on.

589
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,335
Mon Dieu.

590
01:00:09,123 --> 01:00:11,104
Qu'est-ce que c'est ca?

591
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:14,232
Buddy, you're holding up the line!

592
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:20,593
- Sacrebleu.
- Come on, buddy.

593
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:45,157
Fantastique!

594
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:49,015
Come on, Napoleon.
Everybody's waiting for us at the mall.

595
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:58,712
Why be soft and flabby
when you can be firm and trim?

596
01:01:58,817 --> 01:02:00,589
When you can have a body that cries:

597
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:02,570
"Look at me! Admire me!"

598
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:05,594
With our specialized weight-training
and aerobics program...

599
01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:09,869
...we can help you attain the kind of body
you've only dreamed of having.

600
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:12,163
All right, let's go, ladies!

601
01:02:12,893 --> 01:02:16,125
You guys are looking great! Okay!

602
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,253
Jumping jacks! Up!

603
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:26,344
You a musician?

604
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,349
Here. Try this.

605
01:02:55,123 --> 01:02:56,583
What is this?

606
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,675
- Oh, my God.
- What are they doing?

607
01:02:59,711 --> 01:03:02,839
Yeah, don't you think? Look at his sandals.

608
01:03:04,611 --> 01:03:06,593
I don't believe his clothes.

609
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:09,930
- Weird.
- They're coming over to sit down.

610
01:03:12,536 --> 01:03:13,475
Hi.

611
01:03:13,892 --> 01:03:15,247
I'm Billy.

612
01:03:15,977 --> 01:03:17,750
This here is So-crates.

613
01:03:17,854 --> 01:03:19,730
- Socrates.
- We're from history.

614
01:03:22,754 --> 01:03:27,239
Hello. I'm Dr. Freud,
but you may call me Siggy.

615
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,574
Oh, my God.

616
01:03:31,096 --> 01:03:34,849
You both seem to be suffering
from a mild form of hysteria.

617
01:03:34,954 --> 01:03:38,083
- God!
- You are such a geek.

618
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:43,504
Way to go, egghead.

619
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,614
- Geek.
- What is a geek?

620
01:04:21,564 --> 01:04:23,336
I need help. I got a live one here.

621
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:30,948
Okay, I need the Lincoln hat
and the stupid beard back.

622
01:04:31,052 --> 01:04:34,493
You don't understand.
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

623
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,829
Yeah, right. Come on, mister!

624
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:40,437
- It's my hat and my beard!
- Come on!

625
01:04:48,987 --> 01:04:51,489
Keep it up! You're looking great!

626
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:12,760
- Take it easy there!
- Stop! Hold it right there!

627
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:14,533
Cut that guy off!

628
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:19,746
Stop him!

629
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:36,118
- No, Sig! Over here!
- Excuse me, miss.

630
01:05:36,743 --> 01:05:39,141
- Move.
- Pardon me.

631
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,189
- I demand einen lawyer.
- Don't get smart, buddy. Let's go.

632
01:06:01,976 --> 01:06:03,749
There they are!

633
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:14,176
All right, come on, grandpa.

634
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:19,702
Bogus!

635
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:24,499
That's enough.

636
01:06:33,049 --> 01:06:35,134
Mom, can't you go any faster?

637
01:06:50,984 --> 01:06:54,738
I want to know
why you claim to be Sigmund Freud.

638
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:57,449
Why do you claim I'm not Sigmund Freud?

639
01:06:57,658 --> 01:07:00,369
Why do you
keep asking me these questions?

640
01:07:01,411 --> 01:07:02,975
Tell me about your mother.

641
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:04,852
God.

642
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:08,502
- Would you like a couch to lie on?
- No, I don't want a couch to lie on.

643
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:19,241
- All right. What's your name?
- Abraham Lincoln.

644
01:07:19,762 --> 01:07:22,682
That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

645
01:07:23,724 --> 01:07:25,393
I know how to spell "Lincoln."

646
01:07:28,104 --> 01:07:30,189
What's your birthday, Mr. Lincoln?

647
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:34,047
February 12, 1809.

648
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:40,095
Everything is different, but the same.

649
01:07:41,243 --> 01:07:44,370
Things are more moderner than before.

650
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:45,830
Bigger...

651
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:48,750
...and yet smaller.

652
01:07:52,816 --> 01:07:54,485
There's computers.

653
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:00,740
Take your time.

654
01:08:01,574 --> 01:08:04,077
San Dimas high-school football rules!

655
01:08:18,468 --> 01:08:21,179
I can't believe my dad arrested them all.

656
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:24,203
What are we going to do?

657
01:08:24,306 --> 01:08:27,643
You go in and talk to your dad.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

658
01:08:27,747 --> 01:08:31,292
Missy, I mean, Mom,
please keep an eye on Napoleon.

659
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,838
Stay.

660
01:08:39,634 --> 01:08:42,866
- Lock him up with the rest of the wackos.
- I am a lawyer, you know.

661
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:45,682
- Dad!
- You pack your bags.

662
01:08:46,308 --> 01:08:47,976
- What?
- You're going to military school.

663
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,061
- But, Dad...
- I don't wanna hear it!

664
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:53,607
You go home and you pack your bags now!

665
01:09:01,218 --> 01:09:02,850
- How'd it go?
- Bad.

666
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:07,370
Our historical figures are all locked up
and my dad won't let them out.

667
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:09,351
Can we get your dad's keys?

668
01:09:09,455 --> 01:09:12,792
We could steal them,
but he lost them two days ago.

669
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:17,380
If only we could go back in time
to when he had them and steal 'em then.

670
01:09:18,631 --> 01:09:21,342
- Why can't we?
- 'Cause we don't got time.

671
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,427
We could do it after the report.

672
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:26,138
Good thinking, dude!

673
01:09:26,243 --> 01:09:28,849
After the report,
we'll time travel back to two days ago...

674
01:09:28,954 --> 01:09:30,935
...steal the keys and leave them here!

675
01:09:31,665 --> 01:09:35,106
- Where?
- Don't know. How about behind that sign?

676
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:39,694
That way, when we get here now,
they'll be waiting for us.

677
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:43,866
- See?
- Yeah!

678
01:09:43,969 --> 01:09:48,349
So, after the report, we can't forget
to do this, otherwise it won't happen.

679
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:51,999
But it did happen!
It was me who stole my dad's keys!

680
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:54,292
That's exactly it. Come on.

681
01:09:57,942 --> 01:09:59,298
- Mom?
- Yes?

682
01:09:59,714 --> 01:10:02,217
- Can you please bring the car around back?
- Sure.

683
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:07,534
Come on. We've got some
historical figures to rescue.

684
01:10:08,473 --> 01:10:09,932
Over and out.

685
01:10:25,782 --> 01:10:28,284
How are we going to get past my dad?

686
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:32,247
- You got a tape recorder at home?
- Yeah.

687
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:37,043
- Remember to get the tape recorder.
- Yeah.

688
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:39,233
Set a timer on it for...

689
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,422
2:13.

690
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:43,508
- Got it?
- Got it.

691
01:10:46,219 --> 01:10:48,825
- What am I going to say on it?
- Dad!

692
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,119
Hey, Dad!

693
01:10:51,849 --> 01:10:53,310
It's you, dude.

694
01:10:57,689 --> 01:11:00,088
- Ted?
- I'm over here.

695
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:04,988
Yeah, this way!

696
01:11:26,884 --> 01:11:28,449
Look! Check it out.

697
01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:32,306
"Dear Bill and Ted.

698
01:11:32,411 --> 01:11:33,975
"Good luck on the report.

699
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,563
"Sincerely, Bill S. Preston, Esquire
and Ted 'Theodore' Logan."

700
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,231
That was nice of us.

701
01:11:40,857 --> 01:11:42,108
"P.S.

702
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:43,880
"Duck!"

703
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,241
Excellent work, dude.

704
01:11:50,346 --> 01:11:52,223
- Way to go!
- Come on.

705
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,593
- Merci.
- People, time is of the essence.

706
01:12:08,697 --> 01:12:12,138
I ask that you all work together
so that we can get down to the car.

707
01:12:12,175 --> 01:12:13,911
Very quiet. Quiet!

708
01:12:16,101 --> 01:12:18,708
Against the wall, everybody, please.
Single file.

709
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:22,565
- Hurry up, Billy.
- How do we get out of here?

710
01:12:22,983 --> 01:12:24,442
Over here, Dad!

711
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,007
Down here!

712
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,405
Way to go, dude. You stalled him.

713
01:12:28,509 --> 01:12:30,245
What else do I say?

714
01:12:30,282 --> 01:12:35,078
And now, opening for Iron Maiden,
Wyld Stallyns!

715
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,334
Come on, put your back into it.

716
01:12:42,064 --> 01:12:44,254
What in the hell do you think you're doing?

717
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:49,259
- Trashcan. Remember a trashcan.
- Trashcan? What are you talking about?

718
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,240
Get this thing off me!

719
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:55,619
Sorry, Dad,
but we got to go pass our history report.

720
01:12:56,766 --> 01:12:58,852
By the way, I found your keys.

721
01:12:59,164 --> 01:13:01,563
Where are you? Get this off me!

722
01:13:08,653 --> 01:13:12,928
In conclusion, I think Abraham Lincoln
would be most impressed...

723
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:16,577
...with the world of San Dimas.
I know I am.

724
01:13:27,005 --> 01:13:30,445
Down the hall, to the left. Quiet.

725
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:35,555
And I'm sure I speak
for Mr. Ward and Mrs. Rowe...

726
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:38,996
...when I say that your reports
were very entertaining...

727
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:41,499
...and very informative for all of us.

728
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,836
It seems we may be
one report short today...

729
01:13:45,149 --> 01:13:47,442
...so we'll leave just a bit early.

730
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:52,656
But once again, I want to thank you all
for your very hard work.

731
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,618
Who turned out the lights?

732
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:01,414
Hello, San Dimas.

733
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:05,793
Please welcome,
for the final report of the afternoon...

734
01:14:06,002 --> 01:14:08,088
...from all throughout history...

735
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:11,424
...some of the greatest people
who have ever lived...

736
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:15,700
...in their 1988 world tour!

737
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,500
How's it going?

738
01:14:26,022 --> 01:14:27,377
I'm Billy the Kid.

739
01:14:40,724 --> 01:14:43,643
I'd like you all to put your hands together.

740
01:14:50,421 --> 01:14:52,925
Now, my good friends...

741
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:57,304
...Bill S. Preston, Esquire...

742
01:14:57,408 --> 01:15:00,015
...and Ted "Theodore" Logan.

743
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:02,935
Thank you.

744
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,375
Hello, San Dimas High.

745
01:15:07,418 --> 01:15:10,755
Mr. Ryan,
fellow distinguished classmates...

746
01:15:10,858 --> 01:15:12,945
...teachers, babes.

747
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:18,992
- Our first speaker was born in 470 B.C.
- Hi! Long time no see.

748
01:15:19,826 --> 01:15:21,703
A time when much of the world...

749
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:25,248
...looked like the cover of
the Led Zeppelin album Houses of the Holy.

750
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:30,670
We were there. There were many steps
and columns. It was most tranquil.

751
01:15:31,504 --> 01:15:34,841
He is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought.

752
01:15:35,154 --> 01:15:39,116
He was the teacher of Plato,
who was in turn the teacher of Aristotle.

753
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,225
And like Ozzy Osbourne, was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young.

754
01:15:44,955 --> 01:15:46,936
And since he doesn't speak English...

755
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,960
...my friend Ted, here,
is gonna interpret for him.

756
01:15:50,064 --> 01:15:53,193
So please welcome,
to tell us what he thinks of San Dimas...

757
01:15:53,296 --> 01:15:56,842
...the most bodacious
philosophizer in ancient Greece...

758
01:15:57,155 --> 01:15:58,823
...Socrates!

759
01:16:01,534 --> 01:16:04,871
...totally out of control.
I've got a good idea where he gets it.

760
01:16:04,975 --> 01:16:09,876
If you and your wife used a little discipline,
your son wouldn't be such a bad influence.

761
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,962
Is discipline your key to success with Ted?

762
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:14,881
Yes, it is! He's going to
an Alaskan military school.

763
01:16:15,299 --> 01:16:18,218
...loves you best...

764
01:16:20,824 --> 01:16:22,493
...in all the world.

765
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:25,309
What are they doing up there?

766
01:16:26,559 --> 01:16:29,896
He also loves baseball.

767
01:16:31,356 --> 01:16:35,006
Therefore, Ted's father's
own fear of failure...

768
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:38,551
...has caused him
to make his son the embodiment...

769
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:43,660
...of all of his own deepest anxieties
about himself.

770
01:16:44,703 --> 01:16:49,082
And hence,
his aggression transference onto Ted.

771
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:54,608
Okay?

772
01:16:57,007 --> 01:17:00,030
Yes.
Thank you very much, Sigmund Freud.

773
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:06,808
No, just got a minor Oedipal complex.

774
01:17:08,894 --> 01:17:11,605
It is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you...

775
01:17:11,813 --> 01:17:14,941
...a gentleman we picked up
in medieval Mongolia...

776
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:17,026
...in the year 1269.

777
01:17:17,548 --> 01:17:20,571
Please welcome,
the very excellent barbarian...

778
01:17:20,676 --> 01:17:23,178
...Mr. Genghis Khan!

779
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:29,538
This is a dude who, 700 years ago...

780
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,232
...totally ravaged China,
and who, we are told, two hours ago...

781
01:17:34,336 --> 01:17:36,943
...totally ravaged
Oshman's Sporting Goods.

782
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:42,990
A most bodacious soldier and general...

783
01:17:43,095 --> 01:17:46,535
...Miss Of Arc totally rousted
the English from France.

784
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:50,289
And then she turned this dude,
Dauphin, into a king.

785
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:53,105
And all this by the time she was 17.

786
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:57,797
Je vais remporter un triomphe terrible...

787
01:17:58,318 --> 01:18:00,820
...en Russie...

788
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:04,887
...avec mes waterslides.

789
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:09,371
The music of Ludwig von Beethoven.

790
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,627
As you can see,
Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies...

791
01:18:15,731 --> 01:18:17,921
...because of the excellent sugar rush.

792
01:18:18,338 --> 01:18:21,048
He also loves billiards.

793
01:18:23,134 --> 01:18:26,680
Beethoven's favorite works include
Mozart's Requiem...

794
01:18:26,783 --> 01:18:30,225
...Handel's Messiah,
and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet.

795
01:18:31,268 --> 01:18:36,064
To improve on the condition of her armies,
Joan of Arc plans on instituting...

796
01:18:36,101 --> 01:18:39,817
...a full-scale aerobics program
on her return to France.

797
01:18:40,234 --> 01:18:42,737
I don't think it's going to work.

798
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,472
Triomphe, Napol�on!

799
01:18:55,042 --> 01:18:56,398
He loves...

800
01:18:57,857 --> 01:18:59,943
He loves San Dimas.

801
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,246
And now, for our last speaker.

802
01:19:13,602 --> 01:19:18,294
One of the greatest presidents
in American history...

803
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,569
...Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

804
01:19:43,423 --> 01:19:45,404
Fourscore and...

805
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:49,367
...seven minutes ago...

806
01:19:50,096 --> 01:19:53,433
...we, your forefathers...

807
01:19:54,579 --> 01:19:59,167
...were brought forth upon
a most excellent adventure...

808
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:04,381
...conceived by our new friends...

809
01:20:05,737 --> 01:20:06,987
...Bill...

810
01:20:09,073 --> 01:20:10,430
...and Ted.

811
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:15,434
These two great gentlemen...

812
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:19,293
...are dedicated to a proposition...

813
01:20:19,709 --> 01:20:21,691
...which was true in my time...

814
01:20:22,942 --> 01:20:24,923
...just as it's true today.

815
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,639
Be excellent to each other.

816
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,767
And...

817
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:39,104
...party on, dudes!

818
01:20:47,862 --> 01:20:49,636
No way!

819
01:20:59,957 --> 01:21:02,044
Thank you, San Dimas High.

820
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:34,889
We want more!

821
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:42,918
Intro.

822
01:21:43,335 --> 01:21:46,150
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

823
01:21:57,933 --> 01:21:59,497
What's up, Ted?

824
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,961
We traveled through time.

825
01:22:06,066 --> 01:22:10,967
I mean, we met lots of great leaders
and we got an A plus on our history report.

826
01:22:12,531 --> 01:22:15,658
And look at us. Nothing's different.

827
01:22:18,578 --> 01:22:20,455
Maybe it's time we get Eddie Van Halen.

828
01:22:22,436 --> 01:22:24,626
Maybe we should start
learning how to play.

829
01:22:26,086 --> 01:22:27,650
Maybe you're right.

830
01:22:42,977 --> 01:22:46,209
Hello again, my excellent friends.

831
01:22:48,191 --> 01:22:51,216
Congratulations on
passing your history report.

832
01:22:52,362 --> 01:22:55,178
Rufus, the babes.

833
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:57,837
We looked all over England for you.

834
01:22:57,873 --> 01:23:00,392
Where'd you get those savory clothes?

835
01:23:01,538 --> 01:23:04,562
Rufus introduced us to
a place called the mall.

836
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:07,378
And something called credit cards.

837
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:12,695
I got them out of England just before
they had to marry those royal ugly dudes.

838
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,676
Way to go, Rufus.

839
01:23:24,477 --> 01:23:26,876
How can we ever thank you, Rufus?

840
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,420
You can start by signing this for my kids.

841
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:34,592
- Why?
- They're big fans of yours.

842
01:23:34,905 --> 01:23:37,198
- What?
- Everyone is.

843
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:42,099
Wyld Stallyns' music has become
the foundation of our whole society.

844
01:23:43,872 --> 01:23:45,331
No way!

845
01:23:45,749 --> 01:23:47,521
Yes way!

846
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:52,838
In fact, I believe you were there.
That futuristic place with the domes?

847
01:23:53,673 --> 01:23:55,341
And the totally excellent music.

848
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:58,782
They totally worshipped us there.

849
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:00,137
I know.

850
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:04,413
That's why I was sent to make sure
you passed your history report.

851
01:24:04,517 --> 01:24:08,688
If you guys were separated, it would have
been disastrous for life as we know it.

852
01:24:09,105 --> 01:24:13,798
You see, eventually, your music
will help to end war and poverty.

853
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:18,178
It will align the planets
and bring them into universal harmony...

854
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,202
...allowing meaningful contact
with all forms of life...

855
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:26,206
...from extraterrestrial beings
to common household pets.

856
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:27,666
And...

857
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,899
...it's excellent for dancing.

858
01:24:34,339 --> 01:24:37,154
Why don't you have the ladies sign as well,
would you please?

859
01:24:37,259 --> 01:24:40,283
- After all, they are in the band.
- They are?

860
01:24:40,386 --> 01:24:42,994
Excellent!

861
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,600
Where are you going, Rufus?

862
01:24:46,226 --> 01:24:48,103
I got a surprise for you.

863
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:58,321
Here.

864
01:24:59,781 --> 01:25:01,971
That's to help you
as you start your new band.

865
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:03,743
Thanks, Rufus.

866
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:07,497
I just have one further humble request:

867
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:11,250
If I might be so honored to jam with you?

868
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:15,838
- Do you know how to play, Rufus?
- I play a little.

869
01:25:39,822 --> 01:25:43,471
- Most outstanding.
- Let's jam.

870
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:54,523
- Bill, my friend?
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

871
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,339
This has been a most excellent adventure.

872
01:25:58,277 --> 01:25:59,700
- One.
- Two.

873
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,718
One, two, three, four!

874
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,268
They do get better.
