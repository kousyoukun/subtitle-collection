1
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:17,145
Hi. Welcome to the future.

2
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:20,651
San Dimas, California, 2688.

3
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,483
And I'm telling you, it's great here.

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,256
The air is clean. The water's clean.

5
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:28,623
Even the dirt is clean.

6
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,226
Bowling averages are way up.
Mini-golf scores are way down.

7
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:35,635
And we have more excellent waterslides...

8
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:38,197
...than any other planet
we communicate with.

9
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:41,033
I'm telling you, this place is great...

10
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,174
...but it almost wasn't.

11
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,907
You see, 700 years ago,
the two great ones...

12
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,146
...ran into a few problems.

13
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,881
So now I have to travel back in time
to help them out.

14
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:55,817
<i>If I fail to keep these two</i>
<i>on the correct path...</i>

15
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,152
<i>... the basis of our society will be in danger.</i>

16
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:01,258
<i>Don't worry, it'll all make sense.</i>
<i>I'm a professional.</i>

17
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,130
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

18
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:09,730
And I'm Ted... Hold on.
Bill, here, you take it.

19
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,134
Okay.

20
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,340
- And I'm Ted <i>"</i>Theodore<i>"</i> Logan.
- Yeah!

21
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,617
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

22
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,465
- Smell it, dude.
- Let's bail.

23
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,011
We blew it.

24
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,942
Guess we used too much power.

25
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:55,883
I liked it.

26
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:03,152
While I agree that, in time,
our band will be most triumphant...

27
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:06,195
...the truth is,
Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band...

28
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:08,288
...until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.

29
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:12,868
Yes, but I do not believe
we will get Eddie Van Halen...

30
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,563
...until we have a triumphant video.

31
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:17,573
It's pointless to have a triumphant video...

32
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,132
...before we even have decent instruments.

33
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:23,576
How could we have decent instruments
if we don't know how to play?

34
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:26,272
That is why we need Eddie Van Halen!

35
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:29,274
And that is why we need
a triumphant video.

36
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:32,616
Excellent!

37
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,423
- We're late!
- For what?

38
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,027
- For school, dude!
- Yeah.

39
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,403
Bill, I'm waiting.

40
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,701
He's dead?

41
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,851
What you're telling me, essentially,
is that Napoleon...

42
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,320
...was a short dead dude.

43
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,114
Yeah.

44
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,789
You totally blew it, dude.

45
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,220
- Ted, stand up.
- Stand up?

46
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,662
Yes, son. Stand up.

47
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,728
Now...

48
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:21,964
Who was Joan of Arc?

49
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,730
Noah's wife.

50
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,913
Listen, guys, don't forget:
Tomorrow, final report...

51
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,846
...1:30 to 3:30, okay?

52
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,019
Guys.

53
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:46,560
Mr. Ryan...

54
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:51,691
Before you say anything,
my distinguished colleague, Ted, and I...

55
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,359
...wish to express to you our thanks...

56
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,504
...for all the things
we have learned in your class.

57
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:58,939
And what have you learned?

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,913
We've learned
that the world has a great history.

59
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,946
Yes. And that thanks
to great leaders such as...

60
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:14,980
...Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc...

61
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,082
...and Socratic Method...

62
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,857
...the world is full of history.

63
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:28,797
It seems to me the only thing
you've learned is that Caesar...

64
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,937
...is a <i>"</i>salad-dressing dude.<i>"</i>

65
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,607
Bill, Ted, this is really quite simple.

66
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,113
You have flunked
every section of this class.

67
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,275
Now, unless you get an A plus
on your final oral report tomorrow...

68
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,214
...guys, I have no choice
but to flunk the both of you.

69
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,518
You know your topics.

70
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,727
So I would suggest
you at least cover those areas...

71
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,196
...if you want to pass the course.

72
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,861
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:00,797
Okay.

74
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:09,236
Your report
had better be something very special.

75
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,541
Man.

76
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,079
What are we supposed to know
for our report?

77
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,315
I'm not sure.

78
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,826
One thing I know is that
Joan of Arc is not Noah's wife.

79
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:28,524
- Then who is Noah's wife?
- I don't know, Ted.

80
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,901
But I do know we're in serious trouble.
Listen to this:

81
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,964
<i>"</i>Express to the class
how an important historical figure...

82
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,769
<i>"</i>... from each of your time periods...

83
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:42,300
<i>"</i>... would view the world
of San Dimas, 1988.<i>"</i>

84
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,843
We're in danger of flunking
most heinously tomorrow.

85
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,749
- Hi, Bill. Want a ride?
- Sure, Missy.

86
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,145
I mean, Mom.

87
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,628
- Your stepmom is cute.
- Shut up.

88
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:03,029
Remember when she was a senior
and we were freshmen?

89
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,602
I'll be right back as soon as I get my books.

90
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,313
- What are you doing home, Dad?
- I'm looking for my keys.

91
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,858
You haven't done anything with them?

92
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,457
No, sir.

93
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,896
I spoke to your principal today.

94
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,062
- He said you're failing history.
- Me and Bill...

95
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,572
He also said that if you fail history,
you flunk out of school.

96
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,738
You know what that would mean,
don't you?

97
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:52,137
That I would have to go
to Oates Military Academy, sir.

98
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,510
I spoke to Col. Oates this morning.

99
00:08:57,587 --> 00:09:00,181
He's anxious to meet you.

100
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:19,497
Dude, we gotta pass,
otherwise there's no more band.

101
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,746
- Why?
- My dad's sending me to military school.

102
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,641
Where?

103
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,310
Alaska.

104
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:31,413
Alaska.

105
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:42,421
It is time. Their separation is imminent.

106
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,057
Be excellent to each other.

107
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,460
Party on, dude.

108
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>Okay, Ted, George Washington.</i>

109
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:53,300
- One: The father of our country.
- Two: Born on Presidents' Day.

110
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,397
Three: The dollar-bill guy.

111
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,568
You ever made
a mushroom out of his head?

112
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,067
Alaska.

113
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,238
Okay.

114
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,182
Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.

115
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,312
That's Capt. Ahab, dude.

116
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,223
Wait. Remember Disney World?

117
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,920
- Hall of Presidents?
- Yeah, good. What did he say?

118
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,463
<i>"</i>Welcome to the Hall of Presidents.<i>"</i>

119
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,627
Hi. I brought you guys some food.

120
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,548
It's your mom, dude.

121
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,746
How's it going?

122
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,280
Bad.

123
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:51,625
We're destined to flunk
most egregiously tomorrow.

124
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,360
And I am destined to end up
at Oates Military Academy.

125
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,230
And then we will never start our band.

126
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,538
Good.

127
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,807
- What are you guys studying, anyway?
- History.

128
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,176
Mr. Ryan?

129
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,383
Tell him hi.

130
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:19,716
Why don't you guys take a dinner break?

131
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,356
Thanks, Dad.

132
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,770
Now your dad is going for it
in your own room.

133
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,071
Shut up.

134
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,971
- Your stepmom is cute, though.
- Shut up.

135
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:48,347
- Remember when I asked her to the prom?
- Shut up!

136
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,448
1275.

137
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:59,427
Okay, the lady in that car over there...

138
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,931
...said that Marco Polo was
in the year 1275.

139
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,297
It's not just a water sport. I knew it.

140
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:10,664
Excuse me.
When did the Mongols rule China?

141
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,571
I don't know. I just work here.

142
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:21,749
- You want to try the Thrifty Mart?
- Sure.

143
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,701
Not bad.

144
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,875
Greetings, my excellent friends.

145
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:56,708
Do you know
when the Mongols ruled China?

146
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,053
Perhaps we can ask them.

147
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,825
Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

148
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:10,622
And Ted <i>"</i>Theodore<i>"</i> Logan.

149
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,898
Gentlemen...

150
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,601
I'm here to help you
with your history report.

151
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,240
- What?
- How?

152
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:23,936
I hate that part.

153
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,406
- Bill.
- What?

154
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:31,010
Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.

155
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,052
Dudes, you guys are going to
go back in time!

156
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,927
You are going to have the most excellent
adventure through history.

157
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,502
- Who are you guys?
- We're you, dude!

158
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,300
No way.

159
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,271
- No way.
- Yes way!

160
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,538
We know how you feel.

161
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
We didn't believe it either
when we were you...

162
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,147
...and we-us said
what we-us are saying right now.

163
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:02,684
Okay, wait.

164
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:05,577
If you guys are really us...

165
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:09,391
...what number are we thinking of?

166
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,621
Sixty-nine, dudes!

167
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:24,031
- Look, dudes, we gotta go.
- Yeah, we gotta get back to the report.

168
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,333
Rufus!

169
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:30,009
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

170
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,810
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

171
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:37,013
- Who?
- You'll see.

172
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,751
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

173
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:43,792
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed...

174
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,326
Don't forget to wind your watch!

175
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,129
Thanks, Rufus.

176
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,331
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

177
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,912
Dude, are you sure
we should be doing this?

178
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,884
Ted, you and I have witnessed
many things...

179
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,787
...but nothing as bodacious
as what just happened.

180
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,692
Besides, we told ourselves
to listen to this guy.

181
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,662
What if we were lying?

182
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,234
Why would we lie to ourselves?

183
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:35,908
How are you going to help us?

184
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,572
Yeah, are you going to call someone
and get the answers?

185
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:41,845
Gentlemen, we're going to do
a lot more than that.

186
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,415
Excellent.

187
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,026
<i>Brace yourselves, amigos.</i>

188
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:01,468
Gentlemen...

189
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,432
We're history.

190
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,307
Rufus, where are we, dude?

191
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,114
These are the circuits of history,
gentlemen.

192
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:22,055
They'll take us
to any point in time we wish.

193
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:23,216
How?

194
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,288
Modern technology, William.

195
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,374
- That was most unprecedented, Rufus.
- Yeah.

196
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,119
But where are we, Rufus?

197
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,786
Austria, 1805.

198
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,318
The French have just invaded.

199
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:03,365
Bill, check it out!

200
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,724
We're in the middle of a war, dude!

201
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,879
<i>Amigos, time to depart.</i>

202
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,412
How's it going, dude?

203
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:02,688
Now where are we, dude?

204
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,922
It's my house.

205
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:10,523
Rufus, can we go
anywhere we want at any time?

206
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,429
You can do anything you want...

207
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,129
...as long as you remember this:
No matter what happens...

208
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:18,002
...you must get to that report. Got it?

209
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,035
<i>All right, amigos...</i>

210
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:23,236
...that book will give you the number
of anyplace you want to go.

211
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,683
Now, most important,
no matter what you do...

212
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,414
...no matter where you go,
that clock, the clock in San Dimas...

213
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:34,447
...is always running.

214
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:35,888
- Got it?
- Yeah.

215
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,388
All right, time for me to go.

216
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:41,887
- What do you mean, Rufus?
- Yeah, aren't you coming with us?

217
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,859
Gentlemen, you're on your own.

218
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:01,409
- Ted?
- What?

219
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,846
This has been a most unusual day.

220
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,292
- It's Napoleon.
- Who?

221
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:21,032
The short dead dude
from our history review.

222
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,433
I have a most excellent idea.

223
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,471
Grab his legs. We gotta get him inside.

224
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,306
I think I figured out
a way to pass our report.

225
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,506
How?

226
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:36,915
We got one historical figure here,
maybe we can go back and get more.

227
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,612
Yeah.

228
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:42,090
Deacon, you have to watch this guy.

229
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:46,618
His name is Napoleon.
He is a very famous French dude.

230
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:49,597
We've decided to collect
other important figures from history...

231
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,462
...for an oral report we are doing.

232
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:55,231
While we are gone,
you are not to let him out of your sight.

233
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:59,070
Here is some money.
Take him to the movies or something.

234
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:07,874
Napoleon?

235
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,745
I am Bill.

236
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:15,518
We'll take you back to France after
you tell us what you think of San Dimas.

237
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:19,289
- This is Ted's little brother, Deacon.
- Hi.

238
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,886
He'll take care of you.

239
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,331
- Ready, Ted?
- Ready, Bill.

240
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,831
Let's go back into history.

241
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,610
This should be most triumphant.

242
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,841
I want to speak with you, son.

243
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,411
Alone, please, Bill.

244
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:47,351
All right, sit down.

245
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,186
What am I going to do with you?

246
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,421
Great.

247
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,725
You lose my keys, you fail history.

248
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,059
You spend all your time
with your loser friend...

249
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:01,160
...planning a band that will never happen.

250
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,695
You're not to leave this house
until tomorrow morning.

251
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:09,466
Yes?

252
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:13,948
<i>Capt. Logan, this is Dep. Van Halen</i>
<i>down at the station.</i>

253
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,047
Dep. Van Halen?

254
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,823
I'm new, dude... sir.

255
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,056
Look, we found your keys...

256
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,460
<i>... and if you want them,</i>
<i>you better come and get them.</i>

257
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:36,696
When I get back from the station,
I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?

258
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,738
We are in serious trouble.

259
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:49,109
My dad already signed me up.
My plane leaves tomorrow night.

260
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,178
That's only if we fail, dude.

261
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,351
No way!

262
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:03,994
Okay, we got Sigmund Frood,
Beeth Oven...

263
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:08,264
Is there one for the Western Movement
in America in the 19th century?

264
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,263
Yeah.

265
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,273
Well, then...

266
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,142
Let's reach out and touch someone.

267
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:07,622
How's it going, Old West dude?

268
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:12,530
This is just like Frontierland.

269
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,069
Yeah, but you can get shot here.

270
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:19,203
- So just try to act natural.
- Okay.

271
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:24,645
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy.

272
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,171
- Watch out for the horse crap.
- Thanks, dude.

273
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:31,012
- I'm totally thirsty.
- Me, too.

274
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,230
Two beers, please.

275
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:58,873
- He didn't even card us, dude.
- Yeah, we'll have to remember this place.

276
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,721
Who should we take with us?

277
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:21,264
- Who's he?
- He's Billy the Kid.

278
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:26,074
He's famous, dude. Let's bag him.

279
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,671
I need two men.

280
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:33,909
Who's with me?

281
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,643
We're with you, Billy the Kid.

282
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:49,820
Here's the deal. What I win, I keep.

283
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:53,524
What you win, I keep.

284
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,466
Sounds good, Mr. The Kid.

285
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:15,614
Dude, you've got to have
a poker face like me.

286
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:22,492
Three aces!

287
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,392
What the hell's going on here, Billy?

288
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,062
Are you a-cheatin' us, Kid?

289
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,868
Cheating? Me?

290
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:55,094
Excellent!

291
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:07,607
Look, we're totally weak.
We can't possibly fight you.

292
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:11,569
However, how would you gentlemen like...

293
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:16,677
...free passes to Waterloo,
home of excellent waterslides?

294
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,210
Nice try, dude.

295
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,863
Come on.

296
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:40,070
- Look.
- It's the Goodyear blimp.

297
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:49,550
I can't believe they fell for that.

298
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:55,986
- Let's get 'em!
- Let's kill them!

299
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,288
Come on!

300
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:03,828
- You guys saved my life.
- Nothing doing, Billy the Kid.

301
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:06,424
- Where are we going?
- The golden age of civilization.

302
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:08,800
- Where?
- Ancient Greece, dude.

303
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:12,068
Don't worry, we'll bring you back
as soon as you talk at our report.

304
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:14,865
What?

305
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:50,944
Socrates?

306
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:56,044
- We know that name.
- Yeah. Look him up.

307
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,984
It's under <i>"</i>So-crates.<i>"</i>

308
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:00,650
Yeah.

309
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,691
<i>"</i>So-crates:

310
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,928
<i>"'</i>The only true wisdom...

311
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,056
<i>"'</i>... consists in knowing
that you know nothing.<i>"'</i>

312
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,161
That's us, dude!

313
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:16,799
Yeah!

314
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,364
- Let's bag him.
- Yeah.

315
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:36,948
How's it going?

316
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,994
I'm Bill. This is Ted.
We're from the future.

317
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,841
Socrates.

318
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,006
Now what?

319
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,914
I don't know.

320
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,014
Philosophize with him.

321
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:13,551
<i>"</i>All we are is dust in the wind,<i>"</i> dude.

322
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:22,795
Dust.

323
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:25,765
Wind.

324
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,030
Dude.

325
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,449
Let's get out of here, dude.

326
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,230
All right!

327
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:00,172
Not bad, eh, So-crates?

328
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:05,670
- Where are we, dude?
- England, 15th century.

329
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:08,812
We are in most excellent shape
for our report.

330
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,512
Yeah, all we need is one
more speaker from Medieval.

331
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,883
Excellent.

332
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:16,649
Billy, you are dealing with
the oddity of time travel...

333
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,750
...with the greatest of ease.

334
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,293
Excuse me.

335
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,822
Do you know where
there are any personages...

336
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,697
...of historical significance around here?

337
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,376
Check it out!

338
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,438
Must be the castle of King Henry.

339
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:41,706
Let's go, dude!

340
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,477
Billy, guard the booth.

341
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:48,119
And watch So-crates.

342
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:56,156
Who should we get for Medieval?

343
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,591
How about that gnarly old goat dude?

344
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,340
I'm in love, dude.

345
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:17,752
Those must be the princesses
you told yourself about at the Circle K.

346
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:23,290
We gotta go.
It's a history report, not a babe report.

347
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,425
But, Bill...

348
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,626
Those are historical babes.

349
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:31,790
Okay.

350
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,396
You're the ladies' man.
How are we gonna meet them?

351
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,312
Excellent!

352
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,783
- Bill.
- What?

353
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,054
- These are heavy.
- Yeah.

354
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,627
Heavy metal.

355
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,599
- We better go find the princesses.
- Yeah.

356
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:13,069
Watch it!

357
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:16,006
Who turned out all the lights?

358
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:19,846
- What?
- I'm Darth Ted.

359
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:25,679
I'm Luke Bill.
And you're not my father! No!

360
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,217
Come on!

361
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,553
Beat you, I will, yes!

362
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,233
- I totally conquered you, dude!
- No way!

363
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,032
Come on!

364
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:48,268
I'll never rule the universe with you!

365
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:51,910
- Bill!
- What?

366
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,847
- We totally know how to sword fight!
- Yeah!

367
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,908
Search the castle! There might be more!

368
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,273
Get out of here!

369
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:08,215
Bogus.

370
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:11,987
Heinous.

371
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,924
Most non-triumphant.

372
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:27,707
Don't be dead, dude.

373
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:40,319
You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!

374
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,972
Ted! You're alive!

375
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:10,279
Yeah! I fell out of my suit
when I hit the floor.

376
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,352
Fag!

377
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,282
Dude, you totally boned that dude
in the head!

378
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,690
He's a total bonehead!

379
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:24,659
He's a fat old man. There must be a way
to escape before the night falls.

380
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:25,961
But how?

381
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:28,628
What's that?

382
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:34,002
Those boys. I can't believe they're here.

383
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:38,637
How's it going, ladies?

384
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,750
You're the ones
we saw in front of the castle.

385
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:48,179
I am Ted of San Dimas.

386
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:52,991
And I bring to you a message of love.

387
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:56,757
From who?

388
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,324
From myself.

389
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:03,093
And what is this message you speak of?

390
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:09,266
Lyrics, dude. Recite them some lyrics.

391
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:16,749
O you beautiful babes from England...

392
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,510
...for whom we have
traveled through time...

393
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,420
...will you go to the prom with us
in San Dimas?

394
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,755
We will have a most triumphant time.

395
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:28,289
Way to go, dude.

396
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:31,223
It's Father!

397
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,768
What does your father want?

398
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,335
We're to be married to
two horrible old men today.

399
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:46,607
No way!

400
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:49,441
Will you help us escape?

401
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,079
Of course, babes.

402
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,626
How's it going, royal ugly dudes?

403
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:05,696
I'm the Earl of Preston.

404
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,664
And I am the Duke of Ted.

405
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:25,586
Put them in the iron maiden.

406
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,385
Iron maiden? Excellent!

407
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,020
Execute them.

408
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,651
Bogus.

409
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,262
We'll save you, babes!

410
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,899
Witches! Heretics! I saw them!

411
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:47,104
They fell from the sky!

412
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:48,807
Heretics!

413
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:51,578
They fell out of the sky!

414
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,180
They had fire in their eyes
and they had horns!

415
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:07,324
Off with their heads!

416
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,302
- Bill?
- What?

417
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:20,299
I believe our adventure through time
has taken a most serious turn.

418
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,581
- Billy!
- So-crates!

419
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,353
Let's go!

420
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:38,993
Guards! After them!

421
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:41,525
- So-crates!
- Bye, babes!

422
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:45,656
Catch you later, evil dudes.

423
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,735
Kill them! Guards!

424
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:58,643
Hurry up!

425
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,180
Out of the way!

426
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,255
Dial fast, dude!

427
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,132
<i>The number you have</i>
<i>dialed is not in service at this time.</i>

428
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,069
<i>Please check your directory and dial again.</i>

429
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:58,469
<i>Party on, dude.</i>

430
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,840
Okay, I got one! Let's go!

431
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,010
You guys stay here.

432
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,749
Where are we, dude?

433
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,357
I don't know.

434
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:56,354
- Sure do play excellent music.
- Most outstanding.

435
00:42:16,184 --> 00:42:19,813
- It's you.
- Yeah. It's us.

436
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,520
Who are we?

437
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,903
I think they want us to say something.

438
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,005
What should I say?

439
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:21,044
Make something up.

440
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,784
Be excellent to each other.

441
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:40,128
Party on, dudes.

442
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,769
Good one, dude.

443
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,371
Got to get back to our report.

444
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:55,382
Yeah. We'd take you with us,
but it's a history report...

445
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,213
...not a future report.

446
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:01,883
Later.

447
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,052
Later.

448
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,694
- Let's get back and do our report.
- Good idea.

449
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:32,915
- Dude! Where are we going?
- I don't know! I think the booth's broke!

450
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:36,615
We've got to keep dialing San Dimas
until we get back and get Napoleon.

451
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:41,492
Behold.

452
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:42,989
The Zyggie Pig.

453
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:46,727
The single greatest ice-cream spectacle
known to man.

454
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:51,238
<i>"</i>Eat the Pig, eat the Pig,
zyggie, zyggie, zyggie, zyg!<i>"</i>

455
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:56,733
<i>Embêtants!</i>

456
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:00,947
It's ice cream.

457
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,281
You eat it.

458
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:05,749
It's good.

459
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:09,046
<i>La glace.</i>

460
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:11,657
Whatever. Just eat it.

461
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,877
All behold!

462
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:37,850
- He ate the Pig, thus proving that he's...
- A...

463
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,911
<i>"</i>Zyggie piggy!<i>"</i>

464
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:00,138
What's that?

465
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:05,578
I don't know.

466
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:12,218
Shit!

467
00:46:35,176 --> 00:46:37,144
Where did we land now?

468
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:40,410
Dude, it's Sigmund Frood.

469
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:43,016
How much time we got left?

470
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:45,148
Tons. Why?

471
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:47,682
Extra credit, dude.

472
00:46:51,425 --> 00:46:53,188
How's it going, Frood dude?

473
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,101
What is this? Let go of me.
What are you doing?

474
00:47:45,513 --> 00:47:48,414
<i>Was? Was ist los?</i>

475
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,710
Come on, So-crates.

476
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:42,632
Welcome aboard, Miss Joan of Arc.

477
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,397
My name is Ted and this is Bill.

478
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,030
Want a Twinkie, Genghis Khan?

479
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,927
Say please.

480
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:21,566
Come on, guys. Jump him!

481
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,504
Candygram!

482
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:40,487
Yes, what can I...

483
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:52,062
We've got plenty of time,
but we don't have any more room left.

484
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:54,334
- Ted, we're out of control.
- What?

485
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,568
Next place we stop...

486
00:49:55,643 --> 00:49:59,238
...we gotta try and figure out
what's wrong with the booth.

487
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:09,982
Bill, I think I got an idea what's wrong.

488
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,417
What?

489
00:50:11,826 --> 00:50:13,657
The antenna's broken.

490
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:23,961
Yeah. All right.

491
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:54,161
<i>Attends.</i>

492
00:50:58,772 --> 00:50:59,761
<i>Crétin.</i>

493
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:19,059
Come on, let's ditch him.

494
00:51:24,732 --> 00:51:27,132
<i>Attends!</i>

495
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:29,997
<i>Attends!</i>

496
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:36,239
<i>- Excusez-moi, monsieur.</i>
- Hold on there. Not so fast, buddy.

497
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,369
- <i>"</i>Buddy<i>"</i>?
- You ain't paid yet.

498
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:42,079
- Pay?
- Pay.

499
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,588
I don't want to see
you around here anymore! Beat it!

500
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:52,888
<i>- Vous me connaissez, monsieur?</i>
- Beat it, buddy!

501
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:55,621
<i>Idiot!</i>

502
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,740
Deacon!

503
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:27,985
Here is a treat to make
our minor prehistoric pit stop...

504
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:30,493
...a bit more enjoyable.

505
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:33,665
Why, thank you.

506
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:03,863
Thanks, guys.

507
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:09,168
I sure hope this works.

508
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:25,842
I think it's working, dude.

509
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:41,724
Just a little farther, I hope.

510
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,412
That's us. We're back in San Dimas!

511
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:57,515
Yeah. Only now it's not now,
it's last night.

512
00:53:57,885 --> 00:53:58,874
Dude.

513
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:01,785
- What?
- Let's go talk to ourselves.

514
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:03,186
Excellent.

515
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:07,660
- What did we say, anyways?
- I don't know. Let's go find out.

516
00:54:08,696 --> 00:54:10,561
Sixty-nine, dudes!

517
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:16,002
Look, dudes, we gotta go.

518
00:54:18,806 --> 00:54:22,037
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

519
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:26,512
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

520
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,775
- Who?
- You'll see.

521
00:54:31,218 --> 00:54:33,778
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

522
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:37,312
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed for San Dimas...

523
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:40,155
...brought us here
instead of to tomorrow, Rufus?

524
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:43,287
Because in San Dimas
it is tomorrow, William.

525
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,730
You have to dial one number higher.

526
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:49,462
Yeah. Thanks, Rufus.

527
00:54:49,837 --> 00:54:52,169
And hurry,
because you don't have much time.

528
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,140
What do you mean, Rufus?
We got 10 hours left.

529
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,943
You got two hours.

530
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:03,582
Ted, you forgot to wind your watch again.
And after you reminded yourself not to.

531
00:55:03,784 --> 00:55:08,744
I better remind myself again.
Don't forget to wind your watch!

532
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:11,915
Thanks, Rufus.

533
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:16,028
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.

534
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:20,095
That conversation
made more sense this time.

535
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:23,159
- Watch the gonads, dude.
- Abe, you're too tall, man.

536
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,802
That's just the way I'm built.

537
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,241
Great, we made it!

538
00:55:38,646 --> 00:55:41,911
<i>Who's the señorita? She's cute.</i>

539
00:55:41,983 --> 00:55:43,712
It's his mom, dude.

540
00:55:47,355 --> 00:55:48,413
Hi, guys.

541
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:50,548
Hi, Missy, I mean, Mom.

542
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:55,955
Miss Preston,
we'd like you to meet some of our friends.

543
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,227
Yeah, this is Dave Beeth Oven.

544
00:56:00,101 --> 00:56:01,568
<i>Sie sind so schön, Madame.</i>

545
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:05,570
And Maxine of Arc, Missy.

546
00:56:06,707 --> 00:56:08,231
Herman the Kid.

547
00:56:09,076 --> 00:56:10,475
Bob Genghis Khan.

548
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:13,572
So-crates Johnson.

549
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:15,777
Dennis Frood.

550
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,481
And...

551
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:21,713
Abraham Lincoln.

552
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:26,423
It's nice to meet you all.
There are sodas in the fridge.

553
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:30,261
Can you give us a ride someplace?

554
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:33,494
Bill, I'm not taking you anywhere
until you do your chores.

555
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:11,698
Done!

556
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:15,773
This is the San Dimas Mall...

557
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,107
...and this is where
people of today's world hang out.

558
00:57:20,181 --> 00:57:22,649
All right, everybody,
watch your step getting off.

559
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:25,880
Beeth Oven,
make sure you don't get sucked under.

560
00:57:28,222 --> 00:57:31,453
Everybody get together.
Remember who your buddy is.

561
00:57:32,193 --> 00:57:35,094
So-crates, watch out for your robe, dude.

562
00:57:37,832 --> 00:57:38,856
Okay.

563
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:41,567
Follow me.

564
00:57:41,636 --> 00:57:45,003
You got your Broadway down here,
you got your Sears over here.

565
00:57:45,606 --> 00:57:49,906
<i>The stratification of our society</i>
<i>is much like Marie-Antoinette's.</i>

566
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:51,501
<i>The few possess much...</i>

567
00:57:51,879 --> 00:57:55,246
<i>... while the masses possess little</i>
<i>but their television sets.</i>

568
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:57,647
<i>This dichotomy led to a revolution...</i>

569
00:57:57,718 --> 00:58:00,687
<i>... in which Antoinette</i>
<i>and her husband were beheaded.</i>

570
00:58:00,755 --> 00:58:03,315
<i>Today, leaders are impeached</i>
<i>rather than beheaded.</i>

571
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:08,786
<i>Still, while in her day, Marie-Antoinette</i>
<i>said, "Let them eat cake..."</i>

572
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:11,991
<i>... perhaps today she'd say,</i>
<i>"Let them eat fast food."</i>

573
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:21,497
- Enjoy!
- Okay, look around. See what you think.

574
00:58:21,976 --> 00:58:24,342
We'll be back as soon as
we find Napoleon, okay?

575
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:27,672
Come on, dude. We don't got much time.

576
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:29,841
Yes, but what do we eat?

577
00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:32,080
You ditched Napoleon?

578
00:58:32,954 --> 00:58:37,015
Do you realize you've stranded one of
Europe's greatest leaders in San Dimas?

579
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:38,080
He was a dick!

580
00:58:42,496 --> 00:58:44,691
How are we going to find him?

581
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:48,563
Okay, wait.

582
00:58:49,437 --> 00:58:52,565
If we were one of
the greatest generals in history...

583
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,932
...and we were stranded
in San Dimas for one day...

584
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:58,505
...where would we go?

585
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:03,511
Waterloo!

586
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:20,097
Eleven children, please. Are you okay?

587
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:25,996
We're going.

588
00:59:27,308 --> 00:59:28,536
Come on.

589
00:59:31,879 --> 00:59:33,312
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

590
00:59:50,164 --> 00:59:52,132
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?</i>

591
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,267
Buddy, you're holding up the line!

592
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:01,564
<i>- Sacrebleu.</i>
- Come on, buddy.

593
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:26,158
<i>Fantastique!</i>

594
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:29,993
Come on, Napoleon.
Everybody's waiting for us at the mall.

595
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:39,699
<i>Why be soft and flabby</i>
<i>when you can be firm and trim?</i>

596
01:01:39,774 --> 01:01:41,571
<i>When you can have a body that cries:</i>

597
01:01:41,642 --> 01:01:43,610
<i>"Look at me! Admire me!"</i>

598
01:01:43,677 --> 01:01:46,578
<i>With our specialized weight-training</i>
<i>and aerobics program...</i>

599
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:50,913
<i>... we can help you attain the kind of body</i>
<i>you've only dreamed of having.</i>

600
01:01:51,018 --> 01:01:53,145
All right, let's go, ladies!

601
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:57,152
You guys are looking great! Okay!

602
01:01:58,025 --> 01:02:00,289
Jumping jacks! Up!

603
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:07,328
You a musician?

604
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,302
Here. Try this.

605
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,563
What is this?

606
01:02:37,998 --> 01:02:40,694
- Oh, my God.
- What are they doing?

607
01:02:40,768 --> 01:02:43,828
Yeah, don't you think? Look at his sandals.

608
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:47,607
I don't believe his clothes.

609
01:02:47,942 --> 01:02:50,934
- Weird.
- They're coming over to sit down.

610
01:02:53,514 --> 01:02:54,538
Hi.

611
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:56,280
I'm Billy.

612
01:02:57,017 --> 01:02:58,746
This here is So-crates.

613
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:00,684
- Socrates.
- We're from history.

614
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:08,251
Hello. I'm Dr. Freud,
but you may call me Siggy.

615
01:03:08,796 --> 01:03:11,594
Oh, my God.

616
01:03:12,066 --> 01:03:15,866
You both seem to be suffering
from a mild form of hysteria.

617
01:03:15,936 --> 01:03:19,064
- God!
- You are such a geek.

618
01:03:22,643 --> 01:03:24,474
Way to go, egghead.

619
01:03:26,614 --> 01:03:29,606
- Geek.
- What is a geek?

620
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:04,312
I need help. I got a live one here.

621
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:11,955
Okay, I need the Lincoln hat
and the stupid beard back.

622
01:04:12,026 --> 01:04:15,462
You don't understand.
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

623
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,831
Yeah, right. Come on, mister!

624
01:04:18,899 --> 01:04:21,493
- It's my hat and my beard!
- Come on!

625
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:32,478
Keep it up! You're looking great!

626
01:04:51,231 --> 01:04:53,825
- Take it easy there!
- Stop! Hold it right there!

627
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:55,528
Cut that guy off!

628
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:00,733
Stop him!

629
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:17,090
- No, Sig! Over here!
- Excuse me, miss.

630
01:05:17,725 --> 01:05:20,125
- Move.
- Pardon me.

631
01:05:22,563 --> 01:05:26,158
<i>- I demand einen lawyer.</i>
- Don't get smart, buddy. Let's go.

632
01:05:42,983 --> 01:05:44,746
There they are!

633
01:05:53,193 --> 01:05:55,218
All right, come on, grandpa.

634
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,660
Bogus!

635
01:06:03,971 --> 01:06:05,529
That's enough.

636
01:06:14,048 --> 01:06:16,175
Mom, can't you go any faster?

637
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:35,696
I want to know
why you claim to be Sigmund Freud.

638
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,465
Why do you claim I'm not Sigmund Freud?

639
01:06:38,605 --> 01:06:41,335
Why do you
keep asking me these questions?

640
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:43,968
Tell me about your mother.

641
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:45,839
God.

642
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,572
- Would you like a couch to lie on?
- No, I don't want a couch to lie on.

643
01:06:57,024 --> 01:07:00,289
- All right. What's your name?
- Abraham Lincoln.

644
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:03,753
That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

645
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:06,426
I know how to spell <i>"</i>Lincoln.<i>"</i>

646
01:07:09,103 --> 01:07:11,162
What's your birthday, Mr. Lincoln?

647
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:15,069
February 12, 1809.

648
01:07:18,479 --> 01:07:21,073
<i>Everything is different, but the same.</i>

649
01:07:22,282 --> 01:07:25,342
<i>Things are more moderner than before.</i>

650
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:26,814
<i>Bigger...</i>

651
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:29,755
<i>... and yet smaller.</i>

652
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:35,522
<i>There's computers.</i>

653
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:41,763
Take your time.

654
01:07:42,603 --> 01:07:45,071
<i>San Dimas high-school football rules!</i>

655
01:07:59,453 --> 01:08:02,183
I can't believe my dad arrested them all.

656
01:08:03,824 --> 01:08:05,223
What are we going to do?

657
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:08,659
You go in and talk to your dad.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

658
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:12,290
Missy, I mean, Mom,
please keep an eye on Napoleon.

659
01:08:14,868 --> 01:08:15,857
Stay.

660
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,838
- Lock him up with the rest of the wackos.
- I am a lawyer, you know.

661
01:08:23,911 --> 01:08:26,675
- Dad!
- You pack your bags.

662
01:08:27,281 --> 01:08:29,010
- What?
- You're going to military school.

663
01:08:29,082 --> 01:08:31,073
- But, Dad...
- I don't wanna hear it!

664
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:34,647
You go home and you pack your bags now!

665
01:08:42,196 --> 01:08:43,857
- How'd it go?
- Bad.

666
01:08:43,931 --> 01:08:48,425
Our historical figures are all locked up
and my dad won't let them out.

667
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:50,364
Can we get your dad's keys?

668
01:08:50,437 --> 01:08:53,804
We could steal them,
but he lost them two days ago.

669
01:08:53,874 --> 01:08:58,402
If only we could go back in time
to when he had them and steal 'em then.

670
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:02,343
- Why can't we?
- 'Cause we don't got time.

671
01:09:02,516 --> 01:09:04,450
We could do it after the report.

672
01:09:05,652 --> 01:09:07,210
Good thinking, dude!

673
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:09,915
After the report,
we'll time travel back to two days ago...

674
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:11,958
...steal the keys and leave them here!

675
01:09:12,693 --> 01:09:16,094
- Where?
- Don't know. How about behind that sign?

676
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:20,661
That way, when we get here now,
they'll be waiting for us.

677
01:09:22,536 --> 01:09:24,868
- See?
- Yeah!

678
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:29,339
So, after the report, we can't forget
to do this, otherwise it won't happen.

679
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:32,970
But it did happen!
It was me who stole my dad's keys!

680
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:35,272
That's exactly it. Come on.

681
01:09:38,986 --> 01:09:40,248
- Mom?
- Yes?

682
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:43,246
- Can you please bring the car around back?
- Sure.

683
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:48,519
Come on. We've got some
historical figures to rescue.

684
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:50,896
Over and out.

685
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,338
How are we going to get past my dad?

686
01:10:10,317 --> 01:10:13,218
- You got a tape recorder at home?
- Yeah.

687
01:10:14,154 --> 01:10:18,090
- Remember to get the tape recorder.
- Yeah.

688
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:20,251
Set a timer on it for...

689
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:22,420
2:13.

690
01:10:22,663 --> 01:10:24,494
- Got it?
- Got it.

691
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:29,863
- What am I going to say on it?
<i>- Dad!</i>

692
01:10:31,138 --> 01:10:32,162
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

693
01:10:32,806 --> 01:10:34,330
It's you, dude.

694
01:10:38,712 --> 01:10:41,078
- Ted?
<i>- I'm over here.</i>

695
01:10:43,684 --> 01:10:45,982
<i>Yeah, this way!</i>

696
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:09,431
Look! Check it out.

697
01:11:11,678 --> 01:11:13,305
<i>"</i>Dear Bill and Ted.

698
01:11:13,413 --> 01:11:15,040

01:11:15,115 --> 01:11:19,609

700
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,180
That was nice of us.

701
01:11:21,922 --> 01:11:23,116
<i>"</i>P.S.

702
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:24,917
<i>"</i>Duck!<i>"</i>

703
01:11:30,197 --> 01:11:31,289
Excellent work, dude.

704
01:11:31,365 --> 01:11:33,230
- Way to go!
- Come on.

705
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,605
<i>- Merci.</i>
- People, time is of the essence.

706
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:53,119
I ask that you all work together
so that we can get down to the car.

707
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:54,949
Very quiet. Quiet!

708
01:11:57,057 --> 01:11:59,719
Against the wall, everybody, please.
Single file.

709
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:03,621
- Hurry up, Billy.
- How do we get out of here?

710
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:05,488
<i>Over here, Dad!</i>

711
01:12:05,899 --> 01:12:07,025
<i>Down here!</i>

712
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,432
<i>Way to go, dude. You stalled him.</i>

713
01:12:09,503 --> 01:12:11,266
<i>What else do I say?</i>

714
01:12:11,338 --> 01:12:16,037
<i>And now, opening for Iron Maiden,</i>
<i>Wyld Stallyns!</i>

715
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,378
Come on, put your back into it.

716
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:25,279
What in the hell do you think you're doing?

717
01:12:25,819 --> 01:12:30,279
- Trashcan. Remember a trashcan.
- Trashcan? What are you talking about?

718
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:32,281
Get this thing off me!

719
01:12:32,793 --> 01:12:36,661
Sorry, Dad,
but we got to go pass our history report.

720
01:12:37,764 --> 01:12:39,823
By the way, I found your keys.

721
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,566
Where are you? Get this off me!

722
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:53,978
<i>In conclusion, I think Abraham Lincoln</i>
<i>would be most impressed...</i>

723
01:12:54,047 --> 01:12:57,574
<i>... with the world of San Dimas.</i>
<i>I know I am.</i>

724
01:13:08,061 --> 01:13:11,462
Down the hall, to the left. Quiet.

725
01:13:12,999 --> 01:13:16,594
And I'm sure I speak
for Mr. Ward and Mrs. Rowe...

726
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,005
...when I say that your reports
were very entertaining...

727
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:22,507
...and very informative for all of us.

728
01:13:23,076 --> 01:13:25,840
It seems we may be
one report short today...

729
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:28,444
...so we'll leave just a bit early.

730
01:13:30,383 --> 01:13:33,648
But once again, I want to thank you all
for your very hard work.

731
01:13:35,622 --> 01:13:37,681
Who turned out the lights?

732
01:13:40,627 --> 01:13:42,458
<i>Hello, San Dimas.</i>

733
01:13:42,963 --> 01:13:46,763
<i>Please welcome,</i>
<i>for the final report of the afternoon...</i>

734
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:49,092
<i>... from all throughout history...</i>

735
01:13:49,202 --> 01:13:52,399
<i>... some of the greatest people</i>
<i>who have ever lived...</i>

736

<i>... in their 1988 world tour!</i>

737
01:14:05,018 --> 01:14:06,542
How's it going?

738
01:14:07,087 --> 01:14:08,384
I'm Billy the Kid.

739
01:14:21,735 --> 01:14:24,636
I'd like you all to put your hands together.

740
01:14:31,444 --> 01:14:33,969
Now, my good friends...

741
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:38,312
...Bill S. Preston, Esquire...

742
01:14:38,451 --> 01:14:41,079
...and Ted <i>"</i>Theodore<i>"</i> Logan.

743
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:43,888
Thank you.

744
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:47,419
Hello, San Dimas High.

745
01:14:48,395 --> 01:14:51,762
Mr. Ryan,
fellow distinguished classmates...

746
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:53,991
...teachers, babes.

747
01:14:55,035 --> 01:14:59,995
- Our first speaker was born in 470 B.C.
- Hi! Long time no see.

748
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:02,774
A time when much of the world...

749
01:15:02,842 --> 01:15:06,300
...looked like the cover of
<i>the Led Zeppelin album Houses of the Holy.</i>

750
01:15:06,713 --> 01:15:11,673
We were there. There were many steps
and columns. It was most tranquil.

751
01:15:12,552 --> 01:15:15,851
He is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought.

752
01:15:16,156 --> 01:15:20,092
He was the teacher of Plato,
who was in turn the teacher of Aristotle.

753
01:15:20,226 --> 01:15:25,186
And like Ozzy Osbourne, was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young.

754
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:27,990
And since he doesn't speak English...

755
01:15:28,068 --> 01:15:30,969
...my friend Ted, here,
is gonna interpret for him.

756
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:34,234
So please welcome,
to tell us what he thinks of San Dimas...

757
01:15:34,307 --> 01:15:37,868
...the most bodacious
philosophizer in ancient Greece...

758
01:15:38,211 --> 01:15:39,872
...Socrates!

759
01:15:42,549 --> 01:15:45,882
...totally out of control.
I've got a good idea where he gets it.

760
01:15:45,952 --> 01:15:50,912
If you and your wife used a little discipline,
your son wouldn't be such a bad influence.

761
01:15:50,991 --> 01:15:52,982
Is discipline your key to success with Ted?

762
01:15:53,059 --> 01:15:55,926
Yes, it is! He's going to
an Alaskan military school.

763
01:15:56,363 --> 01:15:59,196
...loves you best...

764
01:16:01,835 --> 01:16:03,462
...in all the world.

765
01:16:04,404 --> 01:16:06,372
What are they doing up there?

766
01:16:07,507 --> 01:16:10,965
He also loves baseball.

767
01:16:12,312 --> 01:16:16,009
Therefore, Ted's father's
own fear of failure...

768
01:16:16,316 --> 01:16:19,581
...has caused him
to make his son the embodiment...

769
01:16:19,753 --> 01:16:24,713
...of all of his own deepest anxieties
about himself.

770
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:30,095
And hence,
his aggression transference onto Ted.

771
01:16:34,668 --> 01:16:35,657
Okay?

772
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:41,063
Yes.
Thank you very much, Sigmund Freud.

773
01:16:44,811 --> 01:16:47,837
No, just got a minor Oedipal complex.

774
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:52,611
It is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you...

775
01:16:52,786 --> 01:16:55,914
...a gentleman we picked up
in medieval Mongolia...

776
01:16:55,989 --> 01:16:57,980
...in the year 1269.

777
01:16:58,558 --> 01:17:01,550
Please welcome,
the very excellent barbarian...

778
01:17:01,695 --> 01:17:04,186
...Mr. Genghis Khan!

779
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:10,593
This is a dude who, 700 years ago...

780
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:15,268
...totally ravaged China,
and who, we are told, two hours ago...

781
01:17:15,341 --> 01:17:17,935
...totally ravaged
Oshman's Sporting Goods.

782
01:17:20,246 --> 01:17:23,977
A most bodacious soldier and general...

783
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:27,508
...Miss Of Arc totally rousted
the English from France.

784
01:17:27,954 --> 01:17:31,287
And then she turned this dude,
Dauphin, into a king.

785
01:17:31,524 --> 01:17:34,152
And all this by the time she was 17.

786
01:17:35,428 --> 01:17:38,795
<i>Je vais remporter un triomphe terrible...</i>

787
01:17:39,365 --> 01:17:41,833
<i>... en Russie...</i>

788
01:17:42,602 --> 01:17:45,935
<i>... avec mes waterslides.</i>

789
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:50,439
The music of Ludwig von Beethoven.

790
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,675
As you can see,
Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies...

791
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,877
...because of the excellent sugar rush.

792
01:17:59,285 --> 01:18:02,049
He also loves billiards.

793
01:18:04,157 --> 01:18:07,684
Beethoven's favorite works include
<i>Mozart's Requiem...</i>

794
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:11,253
<i>... Handel's Messiah,</i>
<i>and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet.</i>

795
01:18:12,298 --> 01:18:17,031
To improve on the condition of her armies,
Joan of Arc plans on instituting...

796
01:18:17,103 --> 01:18:20,834
...a full-scale aerobics program
on her return to France.

797
01:18:21,241 --> 01:18:23,709
I don't think it's going to work.

798
01:18:27,747 --> 01:18:29,442
<i>Triomphe, Napoléon!</i>

799
01:18:36,022 --> 01:18:37,387
He loves...

800
01:18:38,892 --> 01:18:40,917
He loves San Dimas.

801
01:18:50,703 --> 01:18:53,228
And now, for our last speaker.

802
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:59,271
One of the greatest presidents
in American history...

803
01:19:00,413 --> 01:19:03,576
...Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

804
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,438
Fourscore and...

805
01:19:28,775 --> 01:19:30,367
...seven minutes ago...

806
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:34,409
...we, your forefathers...

807
01:19:35,615 --> 01:19:40,211
...were brought forth upon
a most excellent adventure...

808
01:19:41,754 --> 01:19:45,349
...conceived by our new friends...

809
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:47,987
...Bill...

810
01:19:50,129 --> 01:19:51,460
...and Ted.

811
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:56,468
These two great gentlemen...

812
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:00,330
...are dedicated to a proposition...

813
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,731
...which was true in my time...

814
01:20:03,943 --> 01:20:05,911
...just as it's true today.

815
01:20:10,016 --> 01:20:13,611
Be excellent to each other.

816
01:20:15,655 --> 01:20:16,815
And...

817
01:20:18,358 --> 01:20:20,155
...party on, dudes!

818
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:30,665
No way!

819
01:20:40,914 --> 01:20:43,041
Thank you, San Dimas High.

820
01:21:13,179 --> 01:21:15,875
We want more!

821
01:21:22,755 --> 01:21:23,915
Intro.

822
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:27,154
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

823
01:21:38,938 --> 01:21:40,530
What's up, Ted?

824
01:21:44,978 --> 01:21:46,946
We traveled through time.

825
01:21:47,013 --> 01:21:51,973
I mean, we met lots of great leaders
and we got an A plus on our history report.

826
01:21:53,486 --> 01:21:56,614
And look at us. Nothing's different.

827
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:01,456
Maybe it's time we get Eddie Van Halen.

828
01:22:03,463 --> 01:22:05,624
Maybe we should start
learning how to play.

829
01:22:07,033 --> 01:22:08,625
Maybe you're right.

830
01:22:24,017 --> 01:22:27,214
Hello again, my excellent friends.

831
01:22:29,222 --> 01:22:32,214
Congratulations on
passing your history report.

832
01:22:33,326 --> 01:22:36,159
Rufus, the babes.

833
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:38,527
We looked all over England for you.

834
01:22:38,598 --> 01:22:41,431
Where'd you get those savory clothes?

835
01:22:42,502 --> 01:22:45,562
Rufus introduced us to
a place called the mall.

836
01:22:46,072 --> 01:22:48,404
And something called credit cards.

837
01:22:49,342 --> 01:22:53,676
I got them out of England just before
they had to marry those royal ugly dudes.

838
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,707
Way to go, Rufus.

839
01:23:05,525 --> 01:23:07,857
How can we ever thank you, Rufus?

840
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,396
You can start by signing this for my kids.

841
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:15,560
- Why?
- They're big fans of yours.

842
01:23:15,968 --> 01:23:18,163
- What?
- Everyone is.

843
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:23,141
Wyld Stallyns' music has become
the foundation of our whole society.

844
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:26,401
No way!

845
01:23:26,813 --> 01:23:28,508
Yes way!

846
01:23:28,915 --> 01:23:33,818
In fact, I believe you were there.
That futuristic place with the domes?

847
01:23:34,687 --> 01:23:36,348
And the totally excellent music.

848
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:39,815
They totally worshipped us there.

849
01:23:39,992 --> 01:23:41,186
I know.

850
01:23:41,327 --> 01:23:45,388
That's why I was sent to make sure
you passed your history report.

851
01:23:45,565 --> 01:23:49,695
If you guys were separated, it would have
been disastrous for life as we know it.

852
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:54,767
You see, eventually, your music
will help to end war and poverty.

853
01:23:55,441 --> 01:23:59,207
It will align the planets
and bring them into universal harmony...

854
01:23:59,378 --> 01:24:02,211
...allowing meaningful contact
with all forms of life...

855
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:07,176
...from extraterrestrial beings
to common household pets.

856
01:24:07,553 --> 01:24:08,713
And...

857
01:24:09,789 --> 01:24:11,882
...it's excellent for dancing.

858
01:24:15,361 --> 01:24:18,194
Why don't you have the ladies sign as well,
would you please?

859
01:24:18,264 --> 01:24:21,256
- After all, they are in the band.
- They are?

860
01:24:21,334 --> 01:24:23,962
Excellent!

861
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:26,598
Where are you going, Rufus?

862
01:24:27,273 --> 01:24:29,138
I got a surprise for you.

863
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:39,340
Here.

864
01:24:40,786 --> 01:24:43,016
That's to help you
as you start your new band.

865
01:24:43,422 --> 01:24:44,787
Thanks, Rufus.

866
01:24:44,857 --> 01:24:48,486
I just have one further humble request:

867
01:24:48,828 --> 01:24:52,320
If I might be so honored to jam with you?

868
01:24:53,366 --> 01:24:56,858
- Do you know how to play, Rufus?
- I play a little.

869
01:25:20,826 --> 01:25:24,489
- Most outstanding.
- Let's jam.

870
01:25:32,772 --> 01:25:35,366
- Bill, my friend?
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

871
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:38,342
This has been a most excellent adventure.

872
01:25:39,312 --> 01:25:40,711
- One.
- Two.

873
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,680
One, two, three, four!

874
01:25:49,555 --> 01:25:51,284
They do get better.
