Hi. Welcome to the future.

3
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,499
San Dimas, California, 2688,

4
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,999
and I'm telling you,
it's great here.

5
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,582
The air is clean.
The water's clean.

6
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,540
Even the dirt is clean.

7
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,499
Bowling averages are way up.

8
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,874
Mini-golf scores are way down.

9
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,249
And we have more
excellent water slides

10
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,999
than any other planet
we communicate with.

11
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm telling you, this place is great.

12
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,832
But it almost wasn't.

13
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:59,832
You see, 700 years ago, the two
great ones ran into a few problems.

14
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,707
So now I have to travel
back in time to help them out.

15
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,499
If I should fail to keep these two
on the correct path,

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,749
the basis of our society
will be in danger.

17

I liked it.

31
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:13,665
Ted, while I agree that in time
our band will be most triumphant,

32
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,749
the truth is, Wyld Stallyns
will never be a super band

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,957
until we have
Eddie Van Halen on guitar.

34
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,374
Yes, Bill, but... I do not believe
we will get Eddie Van Halen

35
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,249
until we have a triumphant video.

36
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,082
Ted, it's pointless to have
a triumphant video

37
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,874
before we even have
decent instruments.

38
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,207
Well, how can we have decent instruments
when we don't really even know how to play?

39
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,832
That is why we need Eddie Van Halen.

40
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,915
And that is why
we need a triumphant video.

is that Napoleon was

wish to express to you our thanks

for all the things
we have learned in your class.

65
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,540
And what have you learned?

66
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,290
We have, uh...

67
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,457
We've learned that the

to great leaders

the world is... full of history.

It seems to me
the only thing you have learned

73
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,249
is that Caesar...

74

75

Bill, Ted, this is really quite simple.

You have flunked
every section of this class.

that if you fail history,
you flunk out of school.

No way!

00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,082
OK, we got Sigmund Frood,
Beeth-oven... Uh...

329
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:17,582
Is there one for Western Movement
in America in the 19th Century?

Yeah!

Hey, Bill,

01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,415
that your reports were very entertaining

984
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:28,665
and very informative for all of us.

985
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:33,999
So, it seems we may be one report short
today, so we'll leave just a bit early.

986
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,582
[applause, excited murmuring]

987
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,874
But once again, I want to thank you
all for your very hard work...

988
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,540
Hey, who turned out the lights?

989
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,915
[Bill's voice over speaker]
Hello, San Dimas.

990
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:53,582
Please welcome,
for the final report of the afternoon,

991
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,457
from all throughout history,

992
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:58,749
some of the greatest people
who have ever lived,

993
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:03,499
in their 1988 World Tour!

994
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,499
[♪ rock music]

995
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:14,707
How's it going?
I'm Billy the Kid.

996
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,957
I'd like y'all
to put your hands together.

997
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:40,749
And now, my good friends,

998
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,665
Bill S. Preston, Esquire,

999
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:48,707
and Ted "Theodore" Logan!
Yee-haw!

1000
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:51,124
Thank you! Thank you!

1001
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:54,540
Hello, San Dimas High!

1002
01:14:54,791 --> 01:15:00,582
Mr. Ryan, fellow distinguished
classmates, teachers, babes.

1003
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:03,165
Our first speaker was born

1004
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:06,707
- in the year 470 B.C.
- Hi, long time no see.

1005
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,040
A time when much of the world

1006
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,540
looked like the cover of the
Led Zeppelin album "Houses of the Holy".

1007
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,249
We were there.

1008
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,249
There were many steps and columns.
It was most tranquil.

1009
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,165
He is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought.

1010
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:26,249
He was the teacher of Plato, who was in
turn the teacher of Aristotle.

1011
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:31,874
And, like Ozzy Osbourne, was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young.

1012
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:35,040
And since he doesn't speak English,
my friend Ted here,

1013
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:37,040
is going to interpret for him.

1014
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,999
So please welcome,
to tell us what he thinks of San Dimas,

1015
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,832
the most bodacious philosophiser
in Ancient Greece...

1016
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,082
...Socrates!

1017
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:51,957
...is totally out of control. And I think I got
a pretty good idea where he gets it from.

1018
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:55,040
I mean if you and that wife of yours
would show a little discipline

1019
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,165
maybe your son wouldn't be
such a bad influence.

1020
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:59,124
Oh, is discipline your key
to the success with Ted?

1021
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,040
Yes, it is! He's going to an
Alaskan military school!

1022
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:05,540
He loves you best...

1023
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:09,749
...in all the world.

1024
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,082
What are they doing up there?

1025
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:14,749
He also loves...

1026
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,540
...baseball!

1027
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:22,207
[Freud] Therefore, Ted's father's
own fear of failure

1028
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:24,540
has caused him to make his son

1029
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,040
the embodiment of all of his own

1030
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:31,499
deepest anxieties about himself.

1031
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:36,540
And, hence, his aggression
transference onto Ted.

1032
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,999
- Whoa!
- OK, Ted?

1033
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:47,290
Yes, thank you very much,
Sigmund Freud.

1034
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,040
Hm?

1035
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,915
Nah, just got a minor Oedipal complex.

1036
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,665
It is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you

1037
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:04,124
a gentleman we picked up in
Medieval Mongolia in the year 1269.

1038
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:07,707
Please welcome
the very excellent barbarian...

1039
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:10,499
...Mr. Genghis Khan.

1040
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:12,457
[applause]

1041
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:19,124
This is a dude who, 700 years ago,
totally ravaged China.

1042
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,207
And who we are told, two hours ago,

1043
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:23,999
totally ravaged
Oshman's Sporting Goods.

1044
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:29,999
A most bodacious soldier,
and general,

1045
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:33,832
Miss Of Arc totally rousted
the English from France.

1046
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:37,540
And then she turned this dude,
Dauphin, into a king,

1047
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,374
and all this
by the time she was 17.

1048
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:43,207
[speaking French]

1049
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,249
...waterslide.

1050
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,624
The music of Ludwig van Beethoven.

1051
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:02,832
As you can see,
Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies

1052
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:05,040
because of the excellent sugar rush.

1053
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:08,124
He also loves billiards.

1054
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:13,665
Beethoven's favourite works
include Mozart's "Requiem",

1055
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:18,165
Handel's "Messiah",
and Bon Jovi's "Slippery When Wet".

1056
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,707
To improve on the condition
of her armies,

1057
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,040
Joan of Arc plans on instituting
a full scale aerobics programme

1058
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:27,040
on her return to France.

1059
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,249
I don't think it's gonna work.

1060
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:30,874
No?

1061
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,290
Triomphe, Napoleon.

1062
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,415
He loves...

1063
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,249
He loves San Dimas.

1064
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,249
[applause, cheering]

1065
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:59,415
And now, for our last speaker.

1066
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:05,540
One of the greatest presidents
in American history...

1067
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,415
...Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

1070
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:36,749
...seven minutes ago,

1071
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:41,249
we, your forefathers,

1072
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:46,457
were brought forth
upon a most excellent adventure.

1073
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:51,665
Conceived by our new friends...

1074
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,249
...Bill...

1075
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,665
...and Ted.

1076
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:03,124
These two great gentlemen

1077
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:06,624
are dedicated to a proposition

1078
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:09,165
which was true in my time,

1079
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:12,499
just as it's true today.

1080
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:19,874
Be excellent to each other...

1081
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,790

I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

- What's up, Ted?

Well...

1095
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,665
we travelled through time.

1096
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,374
I mean, we met lots of great leaders,

1097
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:58,374
and we got an A-plus
on our history report...

1098
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:02,957
...but look at us, nothing's different.

Maybe it's time we get Eddie Van Halen.

1100
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:11,457
Maybe we should start
learning how to play.

1101
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:14,415
Maybe you're right, Ted.

1103

Hello, again, my excellent friends.

01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:34,915
Whoa!

1105
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,249
Congratulations on passing
your history report.

1106
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:40,290
Rufus.

1107
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:42,040
The babes!

1108
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,374
We looked all over England for you.

1109
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:47,249
Where'd you get those savoury clothes?

1110
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:51,415
Rufus introduced us
to a place called the mall.

1111
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:54,249
And something called credit cards.

1112
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,665
I got them out of England
just before they had to marry

1113
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:59,749
those royal ugly dudes.

1114
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,707
Way to go, Rufus.

1115
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,540
How can we ever thank you, Rufus?

1116
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:17,415
Well, you can start
by signing this for my kids.

1117
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,540
Why?

1118
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:21,540
They're big fans of yours.

1119
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,040
- What?
- Everyone is.

1120
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:28,874
Wyld Stallyns' music has become
the foundation of our whole society.

1121
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,249
No way.

1122
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,249
Yes way.

1123
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,040
In fact, I believe you were there.

1124
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:39,832
That futuristic place with the domes?

1125
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:43,499
And the totally excellent music.

1126
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,582
They totally worshipped us there, Rufus.

1127
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:46,957
I know.

1128
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:50,749
That's why I was sent to make sure
you passed your history report.

1129
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,249
If you guys were separated, it would have
been disastrous for life as we know it.

1130
01:23:55,583 --> 01:24:01,124
You see, eventually your music will help
put an end to war and poverty.

1131
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:04,874
It will align the planets and
bring them into universal harmony,

1132
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,999
allowing meaningful contact
with all forms of life,

1133
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:13,165
from extraterrestrial beings
to common household pets.

1134
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,707
And...

1135
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:17,707
it's excellent for dancing.

1136
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,124
Whoa.

1137
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:23,790
Why don't you have the ladies
sign as well, would you please?

1138
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:26,874
- After all, they are in the band.
- They are?

1139
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:29,749
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

Where are you going, Rufus?

01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,082
I got a surprise for you.

1142
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,415
Here.

1143
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:48,707
That's to help you
as you start your new band.

1144
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,499
Thanks, Rufus.

1145
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:54,540
Now I just have one further
humble request.

1146
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:58,207
If I might be so honoured
to jam with you?

1147
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,999
- Do you know how to play, Rufus?
- Well, I play a little.

01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,915
Whoa!

1150
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:28,832
Most outstanding, Rufus.

1151
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,249
Let's jam.

1153
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:40,957
- Bill, my friend?
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

1154
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,790
This has been
a most excellent adventure.

1155
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:46,124
- One...
- Two...

1156
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:47,915
One, two, three, four!

1157
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,874

1158
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:56,540
They do get better.
