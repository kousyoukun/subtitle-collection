7
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,070
佛雷狄，去找部车来！
Freddy, go and find a cab.

8
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,870
你要我得肺炎吗？
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

9
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,330
别楞在那里，佛雷狄 去找部车来
Don't just stand there, Freddy. Go and find a cab.

10
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,790
好的，我去叫车
All right, l'll get one. l'll get it.

11
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,840

Look where you're goin', dear. Look where you're goin'!

12
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,210
我很抱歉
l'm so sorry.

13
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,540
两束紫罗兰掉到泥里 一天的辛苦就完了
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud. A full day's wages.

14
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,890
佛雷狄，去叫车 是的，母亲
-Freddy, go and find a cab. -Yes, Mother.

15
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,690
他是你的儿子吗？
Oh, he's your son, is he?

16
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,090
如果你尽到一个作母亲的责任
lf you'd done your duty by him as a mother should...

17
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,140
你就应该为此事赔偿 而非置之不理啊
you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's flow'rs and then run away without payin'.

18
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,140
去作你的生意，小女孩
Oh, go about your business, my girl.

19
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,140
你一点都不愿意赔偿？
And you wouldn't go off without payin', either.

20
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,170
两束紫罗兰掉到泥里
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

21
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,880
先生，雨会停吗？
Oh, sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

22
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,280
恐怕不会 现在比刚刚下得还要大
l'm afraid not. lt's worse than before.

23
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,910
如果下得更大 那就是快停的征兆了
lf it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

24
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,820
开心点，长官 买一束可怜女孩的花吧
Cheer up, Capt'n, buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

25
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
很抱歉，我没零钱
l'm sorry, l haven't any change.

26
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,020
我可以找钱给你 来吧，一朵才两便士
l can change 'alf a crown. Here, take this for tuppence.

27
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,600
我告诉过你，我很抱歉 等一下
l told you, l'm awfully sorry. Wait a minute.

28
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,900
有了，三便士，对你可能有用
Oh, yes. Here's three hapence, if that's any use to you.

29
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,370
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

30
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
听着，你小心点 最好给他一束花
Here, you be careful. Better give 'im a flower for it.

31
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,480
柱子后面有个家伙 把你所说的话都记下来了
There's a bloke here behind that pillar... takin' down every blessed word you're sayin'.

32
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,820
我跟他说话又没做错什么事
l ain't done nothin' wrong by speakin' to the gentleman.

33
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,950
我有权利在这里卖花 我是人格高尚的女孩，帮帮我
l've a right t' sell flow'rs if l keep off the curb. l'm a respectable girl, so help me.

34
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,230
我只请他买花又没跟他说话
l never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flow'r off me.

35
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,190
为何如此吵？ 有个侦探纪录她的话
-What's all the bloomin' noise? -There's a tec takin' her down.

36
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,100
我是自立维生
l'm makin' an honest livin'.

37
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
是谁这么吵闹？
Who's doing all that shouting?

38
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,140
先生，别让他起诉我 你不知道这会对我有多大影响
Sir, don't let 'im charge me. You dunno what it means to me.

39
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,980
他们会取消我的资格 只因我在街上跟男士说话
They'll take away me character and drive me on the streets... for speakin' t' gentlemen.

40
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,780
好了...谁要伤害你，傻女孩？ 你以为我是谁啊？
There, there, there. Who's hurting you, you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

41
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,480
我对圣经发誓我并没有说话
On my Bible oath, l never spoke a word.

42
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,680
闭嘴！...我像警察吗？
Shut up! Shut up! Do l look like a policeman?

43
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,090
你为何记下我的话？ 我认识你可以这样吗？
Then what'd ya take down me words for? 'Ow do l know you took me down right?

44
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,690
给我看你写了我些什么事情
You just show me what you wrote ab'ut me.

45
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,670
这不是正确的写字方法 我看不懂
That ain't proper writin'. l can't read it.

46
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,740
我看得懂
l can.

47
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,010
开心点，长官 买一束可怜女孩的花吧
''l say, Capt'n, now buy a flow'r off a poor girl.''

48
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,670
只因为我叫他长官吗
Oh, it's cause l called him ''Capt'n.''

49
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,620
我无意伤人，先生 别让他因这个字而起诉我
l meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay a charge against me for a word like that.

50
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,030
起诉？我不会让他起诉你 先生，如果你是侦探
l'll make no charge. Really, sir, if you are a detective...

51
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,260
除非我要求，你不需要怕我 被这小女孩欺负而保护我
you needn't begin protecting me against molestation from young women... until l ask you.

52
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,590
任何人都看得出来 这女孩伤不了人的
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

53
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,730
他不是侦探 看他穿的皮靴就知道他是绅士
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman. Look at his boots.

54
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,930
你们怎么都是来自塞西？
How are all your people down at Selsey?

55
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,510
谁告诉你我们来自塞西？
Who told you my people come from Selsey?

56
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,940
你别管，他们是的
Never mind, they do.

57
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,800
你怎会到这么遥远的东部来？ 你来自利索格罗夫
How do you come to be up so far east? You were born in Lisson Grove.

58
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,170
我离开利索格罗夫 又有何不对？
Oh, what 'arm is there in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

59
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,350
那里连猪都活不下去 我一星期得付四到六元的房租
lt weren't fit for pigs to live. l had to pay four and six a week.

60
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,180
去住你喜欢住的地方 但别再吵了！
Live where you like but stop that noise!

61
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,820
冷静点！他不会抓你的 你有权利住你想住的地方！
Come, come, he can't touch you. You've a right to live where you please.

62
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,790
我是个好女孩，真的
l'm a good girl, l am.

63
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
你知我从那儿来的吗？ 霍克斯顿
-Where do l come from? -Hawkestone.

64
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,590
真的是耶，我的天啊 你无所不知啊
Who said l didn't? Blimey, you know everything, you do.

65
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,930
先生 你能帮我找部计程车吗？
You, sir, do you think you could find me a taxi?

66
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,510
女士，雨停了 你可以搭公车会汉普顿
Madam, it's stopped raining. You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

67
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
那是你住的地方吧？
That's where you live, isn't it?

68
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,240
真是没礼貌！
What an impertinence!

69
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,050
如果你要算命 告诉我他打哪儿来
Tell 'im where he comes from, if you wanta go fortune-telling.

70
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,310
赤尔登罕，哈络，剑桥还有...
Cheltenham, Harrow... Cambridge and...

71
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,220
印度？
lndia?

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,450
对极了
Quite right.

73
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,230
天啊，他不是侦探 他是个非常爱管事的人
Blimey, he ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

74
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,160
请问你是以此维生音乐人吗？
Do you do this sort of thing for a living at a music hall?

75
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,360
我有考虑过 也许有一天会这样做
l have thought of it. Perhaps l will one day.

76
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,770
他不是位绅士 只会欺负可怜的女孩子
He's no gentleman, he ain't, to interfere with a poor girl!

77
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,470
请教你是从事什么工作？
How do you do it, may l ask?

78
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,700
语言学，说话的科学 这是我的专业和也是嗜好
Simple phonetics. The science of speech. That's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,080
每个人都可以从他的土腔 分辨出是爱尔兰人或约克郡人
Anyone can spot an lrishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

80
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,310
我可以分辨出 每隔六哩的不同人
but l can place a man within six miles.

81
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,250
在伦敦每隔二哩就会有不同 有时甚至两条街
l can place 'im within two miles in London. Sometimes within two streets.

82
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,150
他应该自觉可耻，胆小鬼
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself, unmanly coward.

83
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,090
以此维生吗？ 是的
-ls there a living in that? -Oh, yes.

84
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,220
就让他忙他自己的事 别管这位可怜的女孩
Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl alone.

85
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:52,400
女人，马上停止这讨厌的哭声 或是躲到别处去吧！
Cease this detestable boohooing instantly... or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship!

86
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,270
我有权待在我喜欢的地方 跟你一样！
l have a right to be here if l like, same as you!

87
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,270
发出如此讨厌声音的女人
A woman who utters such disgusting and depressing noises...

88
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,900
就没有资格到处走 没有资格生活
has no right to be anywhere, no right to live.

89
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,420
记住，你是一个有灵魂的人 并具有口齿清楚的天赋
Remember, you're a human being with a soul... and the divine gift of articulate speech.

90
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,820
你的母语是沙士比亚 弥尔顿和圣经的语言
That your native language is the language of Shakespeare and...

91
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,060
别像讨厌的傻瓜般 坐在哪儿咆哮
Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.

92
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,760
看看她，下层人士的话语
Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters

93
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,060
她说的每个音节都不适当
Condemned by ev'ry syllable she utters

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,200
她应该被吊死 因为她无情地谋杀了英语
By right she should be taken out an'hung For the cold-blooded murder Of the English tongue

95
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,840
天啊，这是什么声音！
Heavens, what a sound!

96
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,440
这就是英国人民 所谓的小学教育
This is what the British population Calls an element'ry education

97
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,310
先生 你最好举个失败的例子说明
Come, sir, l think you've picked a poor example.

98
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,780
要吗？
Did l?

99
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,190
听听看苏活区的人 不发“H”的音
Hear them down in Soho Square Dropping ''Hs '' everywhere

100
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,730
照他们喜欢的英语发音
Speaking English any way they like

101
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,530
先生，你上过学吗？
Hey, you, sir, did you go to school?

102
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,260
你“以谓”我是傻瓜吗？
What ya tike me for, a fool?

103
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,990
没人教他“以谓” 是要发成“以为”
No one taught him ''take''instead of ''tike''

104
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,740
听约克人说话 更糟的是听康瓦耳人交谈
Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse Hear a Cornishman converse

105
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,240
我宁愿去听平调的诗歌
l'd rather hear a choir singing flat

106
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,680
如小鸡在粮仓里咯咯叫 就像她一样
Chickens cackling in a barn Just like this one

107
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,280
咯恩！
Garn!

108
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,780
咯恩！
Garn!

109
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,010
我请教你，先生 这是什么字？
l ask you, sir, what sort of word is that?

110
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,280
她总会发出 “奥哦” 和 “咯恩”的声音
lt's ''aoow''and ''garn '' That keep her in her place

111
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,320
不是因为她穿破烂衣服 不是因为她的脸很脏
Not her wretched clothes and dirty face

112
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,190
为何英国人 不能教小孩如何说话？
Why can't the English Teach their children how to speak?

113
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,900
上语言课时很容易区分 现在为时已晚了
This verbal class distinction By now should be antique

114
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,570
如果你说话跟她一样 不像现在这样说话
lf you spoke as she does, sir lnstead of the way you do

115
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,470
你大概也去卖花了
Why, you might be selling flowers, too

116
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,630
你说什么
l beg your pardon.

117
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,140
一个英国人说英语的方式 绝对会影响到他的地位
An Englishman's way of speaking Absolutely classifies him

118
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,780
他一讲英语其他人会鄙视他
The moment he talks he makes Some other Englishman despise him

119
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,290
我怕我们永远听不到正统语言
One common language l'm afraid we'll never get

120
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,850
为何不好好学英文？
Oh, why can't the English learn to

121
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,260
让我们有顺耳的英语 谁的英语会伤害你的耳朵
Set a good example to people Whose English is painful to your ears

122
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,160
苏格兰和爱尔兰的英语 听了会让你流泪
The Scotch and the lrish Leave you close to tears

123
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,730
甚至有些地方正统英语不见了
There even are places Where English completely disappears

124
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,930

252
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,720
你看她说的破英语 这种英语将伴随终身吗？
You see this creature with her curbstone English... the English that will keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?

253
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,050
我训练她六个月后 可以像女公爵般出席大使舞会
ln six months, l could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

254
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,230
我也能让她到需要说 正统英语的地方上班
l could even get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant... which requires better English.

255
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,940
你污辱了这些高贵的建筑物！
You're a disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns!

256
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:10,080
我也能让她到需要说 正统英语的地方上班
l could even get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant... which requires better English.

257
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,110
你听到过多少个母音？
How many vowel sounds did you hear altogether?

258
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,840
我相信我听过24种
l believe l counted 24.

259
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,450
错了，应该有一百种！ 什么
Wrong by a hundred.

260
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,650
正确是130种
To be exact you heard 130.

261
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,350
一次把它们给听完
Listen to them one at a time.

262
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,450
需要吗？ 这样我一个早上就玩完了
Must l? l'm really quite done up for one morning.

263
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,840
请问贵姓大名？
Your name, please?

264
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,880
贵姓大名？小姐！
Your name, Miss?

265
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,120
我的名字跟你毫无关系
My name is of no concern to you whatsoever.

266
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,020
请等一下
One moment, please.

267
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,660
伦敦最近相当脏乱
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

268
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,540
我是这里的管家皮尔斯太太 我能效劳吗？
l'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper. Can l help you?

269
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,200
哦，早安，小姐，我想见教授
Oh, good morning, Missus. l'd like to see the professor, please.

270
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,040
有什么事吗？
Could you tell me what it's about?

271
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,910
是个人的私事！
lt's business of a personal nature.

272
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,320
请等一下
One moment, please.

273
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,720
席根斯先生？ 什么事情，皮尔斯太太？
-Mr. Higgins? -What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

274
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,320
外面有位年轻女孩要见你 先生
There's a young woman who wants to see you, sir.

275
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,630
年轻女孩？
A young woman?

276
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,800
她想要干什么？
What does she want?

277
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,570
她是个相当低俗的女孩 真的很低俗
She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed.

278
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,810
我应该叫她走的 只是我在想你可能要她录音
l should've sent her away, only l thought perhaps... you wanted her to talk into your machine.

279
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,710
她的音调很好玩吗？ 非常可怕，席根斯先生
-Has she an interesting accent? -Simply ghastly, Mr. Higgins.

280
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,510
好，叫她进来，皮尔斯太太 遵命
Good. Let's have her in. Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

281
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,050
运气真好 我让你看我是怎么录音的
You know, this is rather a bit of luck. l'll show you how l make records.

282
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,060
我们先让她说话 把声音纪录到贝尔语音图形中
We'll set her talking and then l'll take her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

283
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,320
然后找开口音 我们就录在留声机里
then in broad Romic, and then we'll get her on the phonograph...

284
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,420
当你想要誊写副本时 你就打开录音
so you can turn her on when you want with the written transcript before you.

285
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,870
就是这位年轻女孩，先生
This is the young woman, sir.

286
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,270
早安，我可以跟你谈谈吗？
Good mornin', my good man. Might l 'ave the pleasure of a word with you?

287
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,040
哦，不 我昨晚已经记载了她声音
Oh, no. This is the girl l jotted down last night.

288
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,170
她没有用 我想录利索格罗夫的术语
She's no use. l've got the records l want of the Lisson Grove lingo.

289
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,180
我不想浪费录音带
l'm not gonna waste another cylinder on that.

290
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,880
你请吧，我不需要你
Now be off with you. l don't want you.

291
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,220
别如此无礼 你还不知道我来此的原因
Don't be so saucy. You ain't 'eard what l come for yet.

292
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,080
你没告诉她我坐车来的吗？
Did you tell 'im l come in a taxi?

293
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,520
胡闹，女孩 你以为席根斯先生会管这些吗
Nonsense, girl. What do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares... what you came in?

294
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,260
哦，都很骄傲
Oh, we are proud.

295
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,530
他不想教人说英语 但是我听到他说过的
Well, 'e ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im. l 'eard 'im say so.

296
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,720
我不是来此致意的
l ain't come here t' ask for any compliment...

297
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,600
如果我的钱不够我就去别处
and if my money's not good enough, l can go elsewhere.

298
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,070
够做什么？
Good enough for what?

299
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,100
足够支付你上课的钱
Good enough for you.

300
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,240
懂了吗？我来这里上课的 并且是付学费，别搞错了
Now you know, don'tcha? l'm come to 'ave lessons, l am. And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

301
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,700
Well!

302
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,010
你希望我对你说些什么？
And what do you expect me to say?

303
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,050
如果你是绅士就应该请我坐下
Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, l think.

304
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,120
你没听到我是带生意来给你的
Don't l tell you l'm bringin' you business?

305
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,330
我们要请这个小妞坐下 还是丢出窗外？
Should we ask this baggage to sit down... or shall we just throw her out of the window?

306
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,870
我不是小妞 何况我像其他小姐一样会付钱
l won't be called a baggage. Not when l've offered to pay like any lady.

307
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,230
你想要干什么，女孩？
What do you want, my girl?

308
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,380
我想要在花店当专柜小姐
l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop... 'stead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

309
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,180
除非我举止优雅 否则他们不会请我
But they won't take me unless l can talk more genteel.

310
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,740
他说他能教我 所以我来付钱请他教
'E said 'e could teach me. Well, 'ere l am ready to pay 'im.

311
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,050
不是要来占便宜的 他却如此对我
Not asking any favor and he treats me as if l was dirt.

312
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,630
我知道你上课的价钱 所以我准备要付钱
l know what lessons cost as well as you do, and l'm ready t' pay.

313
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,930
付多少钱？
How much?

314
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,300
你终于说话了
Now you're talkin'.

315
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,840
我想你是要补偿 昨晚不该如此摒弃我
l thought you'd come off it for a chance o' gettin' back a bit... of what you chucked at me last night.

316
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,840
其实你很欢迎我，是吗？
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you, eh?

317
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,140
坐下
Sit down.

318
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,370
如果你要表达歉意... 坐下
-lf you're goin' t' make a compliment of it-- -Sit down!

319
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,680
坐下，女孩，照他的话做
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

320
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,650
贵姓大名？
What's your name?

321
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,710
伊莱莎杜立特尔
Eliza Doolittle.

322
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,880
你不坐下吗，杜立特尔小姐？
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

323
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,120
我不介意坐下
l don't mind if l do.

324
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,860
你打算要给我多少学费？
How much do you propose to pay me for these lessons?

325
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,560
哦，我知道行情的
Oh, l know what's right.

326
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,440
我的朋友和法国人学法语 每小时1 8便士
A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour... from a real French gentleman.

327
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,880
你不会有脸要我学自己的母语 付同样价钱
You wouldn't have the face t' ask me the same... for teachin' me my own language as you would for French.

328
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,010
因此我只会给一先令 随便你要不要
So, l won't give more than a shillin'. Take it or leave it.

329
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,080
平克林，如果你认为这一先令
Do you know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling...

330
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,750
这不是普通一先令 但以这女孩收入的百分比而言
not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income...

331
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:24,100
这相当百万富翁的 60或70英镑
it works out as fully equivalent of... 60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

332
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,340
天啊，真多 这是我收入最多的一次
By George, it's enormous. lt's the biggest offer l ever had.

333
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,910
60英镑？你在说什么？ 我不能给你60英镑
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about? Where would l get 60 pounds? l never offered you 60 pounds!

334
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,810
我没有60英镑！
But l ain't got 60 pounds!

335
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,870
别哭，傻孩子，坐下 没人会动你的钱
Don't cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody's going to touch your money.

336
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,980
如果你还鬼叫 有人会用扫把打你
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick if you don't stop sniveling.

337
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,450
坐下！
Sit down!

338
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,890
人家会以为你是我父亲！
Anybody'd think you was my father!

339
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,400
如果我决定要教你 我会比你父亲还严厉两倍
lf l decide to teach you, l'll be worse than two fathers to you.

340
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,420
拿去
Here.

341
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,760
这干什么？
What's this for?

342
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,530
擦眼泪 将脸上所有的泪水擦干净
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.

343
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,470
记住这是手帕那是袖子
Remember, that's your handkerchief and that's your sleeve.

344
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,140
如果你想当专柜小姐 就别弄混了
Don't confuse the one with the other if you want to become a lady in a shop.

345
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,240
跟她说这个没用，席根斯先生 她不明白的
lt's no use to talk to her like that, Mr. Higgins. She doesn't understand you.

346
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,610
把手帕给我 他是给我又不是给你
'Ere! Give the 'ankerchief to me. He give it to me, not to you!

347
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,210
席根斯，我很感兴趣
Higgins, l'm interested.

348
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,590
你说过的可以训练她 像女公爵般出席大使舞会
What about your boast... that you could pass her off as a duchess at the Embassy Ball?

349
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,290
如果你办到了 我会说你是世上最伟大的老师
l'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you do that.

350
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,630
我赌所有的实验费用 你办不到的
l'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can't do it.

351
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,630
我会付学费
l'll even pay for the lessons.

352
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,470
你人真好，谢谢，长官
Aw, you're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

353
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,870
这真是无法抗拒
lt's almost irresistible.

354
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,470
她低俗的如此有趣 真是脏死了
She's so deliciously low. So horribly dirty.

355
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,110
我很干净 我洗了脸洗了手才来的
l ain't dirty! l washed my face an' hands before l come, l did.

356
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,140
我接受 我会让她彻底的改头换面
l'll take it. l'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

357
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,050
我们从现在开始，皮尔斯太太 带她下去把她弄干净
We'll start today. This moment. Take her away, Mrs. Pearce, and clean her.

358
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,560
如果洗不干净用砂纸 厨房有炉火吗？
Sandpaper, if it won't come off any other way. ls there a fire in the kitchen?

359
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,690
把她衣服烧了 叫人买些新衣来
Take all her clothes off and burn them and order some new ones.

360
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,500
先用纸把她包起来 直到买回来为止
Just wrap her in brown paper till they come.

361
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,070
你真不绅士，竟说这种话 我是个好女孩
You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk o' such things. l'm a good girl, l am.

362
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,970
我知道你是那种人，真的
And l know what the likes of you are, l do.

363
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,940
我们不要你假正经，年轻女孩
We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman.

364
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,350
你是学变成一位女公爵
You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.

365
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,890
带她走，皮尔斯太太 如果她找麻烦就打她
Take 'er away, Mrs. Pearce, an' if she gives you any trouble wallop 'er.

366
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,790
我会报警的
l'll call the police, l will.

367
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,480
但我没有地方可以安置她
l've got no place to put her.

368
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,290
把她放到垃圾桶里
Well, put her in the dustbin.

369
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,490
拜托，席根斯，讲理一点
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

370
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,860
你得讲理一点，席根斯先生 你不能这样践踏人！
You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins, really you must. You can't walk over everybody like this.

371
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,170
我？践踏别人？
l? Walk over everybody?

372
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,410
亲爱的皮尔斯太太，平克林 我并无意要践踏别人
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering, l had no intention of walking over anyone.

373
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,570
我只是建议 我们要对这女孩仁慈点
l merely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.

374
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,340
我没说清楚 那是我不想伤害她小小的心灵
l didn't express myself clearly because l didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

375
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,880
或是你们的
or yours.

376
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,120
但是，先生 你不能对一个女孩这样
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

377
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,820
好像是你从沙滩边 检回来的石头
as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.

378
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,190
为何不能？
Why not?

379
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,060
为何不能？你对她一无所知
Why not? But you don't know anything about her.

380
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,070
她的父母是谁？也许她结过婚
What about her parents? She may be married.

381
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,530
格恩！
Garn!

382
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,930
这是这女孩常说的“格恩” ！
There. As the girl very properly says, garn!

383
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,400
谁会和我结婚？
Who'd marry me?

384
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,510
天啊，伊莱莎...
By George, Eliza...

385
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,740
在我造就你之前 外面的人宁愿自杀也要避开你
the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men... shooting themselves for your sake before l've done with you.

386
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,260
我要走了
'Ere. l'm goin'.

387
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,090
他是个白痴 我不要这个疯子教我
He's off his chump, he is. l don't want no balmies teachin' me.

388
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,320
疯子？好，皮尔斯太太 不必为她买新衣了
Mad, am l? All right, Mrs. Pearce, don't order those new clothes.

389
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,630
把她赶出去！ 席根斯先生，我不同意这样
-Throw her out. -Stop, Mr. Higgins! l won't allow it.

390
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,200
回到你父母身边去，女孩
Go home to your parents, girl.

391
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,170
我没有父母
l ain't got no parents.

392
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,260
她没有父母，干嘛大惊小怪？
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss about?

393
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,670
没人要她，她对别人没用 但对我有用，带她上楼去
Nobody wants her. She's no use to anybody but me. Take her upstairs!

394
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,250
她会变得如何？ 你要付钱给她吗？
What's to become of her? ls she to be paid anything?

395
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,310
哦，先生，明智一点
Oh, do be sensible, sir.

396
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,180
她要钱干嘛？她衣食充足 如果给她钱她会去喝酒的
What would she do with money? She'll have food and clothes. She'll only drink if you give her money.

397
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,780
你真粗鲁，这是谎言 我从不喝酒的
You are a brute! lt's a lie! Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

398
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,950
先生，你是绅士 别让他如此藐视我！
Sir, you're a gentleman. Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

399
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,990
你感觉到了吗？ 席根斯，她有感情的
Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feelings?

400
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,200
不，我不认为 我们不必担心她的感受
No, l don't think so. No feelings we need worry about.

401
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,720
你有吗，伊莱莎？
Well, have you, Eliza?

402
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,170
我和别人一样有情感
l got me feelings same as anyone else.

403
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,760
席根斯先生 我想知道这女孩在这里的条件
Mr. Higgins, l must know on what terms the girl is to be here.

404
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,030
当你教完之后，她该怎么办？
What's to become of her when you've finished your teaching?

405
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,970
你必须先想好，先生？
You must look ahead a little, sir.

406
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,310
如果她还生活在贫民窟 会是怎么样，皮尔斯太太？
What's to become of her if we leave her in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

407
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,710
那是她的自己事，不是你的事 席根斯先生
That's her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins.

408
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,440
我教完了她就回贫民窟
When l'm done we'll throw her back.

409
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,540
那又是为她的自己事 就没有关系了
Then it'll be her own business again. That'll be all right, won't it?

410
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,520
你真的是无情无义！
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya !

411
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,120
你除了自己之外 其他的都不关心
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

412
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,760
我受够了，我真的要走了 你该为自己感到羞耻
l've 'ad enough of this. l'm goin', l am ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

413
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,660
吃点巧克力，伊莱莎
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

414
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,200
我怎么知道这里面有什么？
'Ow do l know what might be in 'em?

415
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,210
我听说很多女孩都因此受骗
l've 'eard of girls bein' drugged by the likes o' you.

416
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,180
我保证
Pledge of good faith.

417
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,610
我吃一半
l'll take one half.

418
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,970
你吃另一半
And you take the other.

419
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,560
你每天都会有 好几个盒巧克力可以吃
You'll have boxes of them, barrels of them every day.

420
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,520
你可以三餐都吃
You'll live on them, eh?

421
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,830
我不会这样吃 除非我需要才会吃它
l wouldn't 've ate it, only l'm too laidylike to take it out o' me mouth.

422
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,240
想想看，伊莱莎 巧克力和车子还有黄金，钻石
Think of it, Eliza. Think of chocolates, and taxis... and gold and diamonds.

423
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,240
我不要黄金和钻石 我是个好女孩
l don't want no gold and no diamonds. l'm a good girl, l am.

424
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,100
席根斯，我必须要说 皮尔斯太太说的非常对
Higgins, l really must interfere. Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

425
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,120
如果这女孩 要参与你的六个月实验
lf this girl's going to put herself in your hands for six months...

426
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,280
她一定要完全了解她在作什么
for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly what she's doing.

427
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:56,190
伊莱莎，你今后这六个月 住在这学习像淑女般地说话
You are to stay here for the next six months... learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florist shop.

428
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,900
如果你很乖，照我的话做 你会有很舒适的卧房可以睡
lf you're good and do what you're told, you shall sleep in a proper bedroom...

429
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,300
有很多东西吃 有钱买巧克力还车子可以坐
have lots to eat, money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

430
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,780
但是如果你顽皮，懒惰 你在厨房跟蟑螂睡
But if you are naughty and idle... you shall sleep in the kitchen amongst the black beetles...

431
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,720
并被皮尔斯太太用扫把打
and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick.

432
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:23,920
六个月后，你就会坐着马车 穿着漂亮衣服去白金汉宫
At the end of six months, you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace... in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

433
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,020
如果国王发现你不是淑女
lf the King finds out that you are not a lady...

434
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,400
警察会抓你去伦敦塔 把你的头砍掉
the police will take you to the Tower of London where your head will be cut off...

435
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,470
用来警告其他傲慢的卖花女
as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls.

436
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,300
但是如果你没被发现 你会有礼物
But if you are not found out you shall have a present of...

437
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,240
会有机会成为 从事花店生意的淑女
seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop.

438
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:50,540
如果你拒绝 你就是个薄情的讨厌女孩
lf you refuse this offer... you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl...

439
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,580
天使也会为你悲叹！
and the angels will weep for you!

440
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,250
满意了吗，平克林？
Now are you satisfied, Pickering?

441
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,200
我不知道你在说些什么
l don't understand what you are talking about.

442
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,730
要我再进一步说明吗 皮尔斯太太？
Could l put it more plainly or fairly, Mrs. Pearce?

443
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,730
跟我来，伊莱沙
Come with me.

444
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,600
这样就对了，带她去浴室
That's right. Bundle her off to the bathroom.

445
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,000
你很会欺负人！
You're a great bully, you are!

446
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,840
只要我不高兴我就走人 我不要让别人打我！
l won't stay here if l don't like it. l won't let nobody wallop me!

447
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,280
别顶嘴了，女孩
Don't answer back, girl.

448
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,150
早知如此我不该来这里 我是个好女孩 不要打我
l've always been a good girl, l 'ave.

449
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,120
六个月，三个月后 如果她学习得快
ln six months-- ln three, if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

450
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,750
我就会带她到各处去 训练她所有的礼仪
l'll take her anywhere and l'll pass her off as anything.

451
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,620
我要把不幸的野蛮人变成女王
l'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

452
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,130
我这一生从未洗过澡 没洗过你们那种澡
l've never had a bath in me life. Not what you'd call a proper one.

453
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,500
如果外表不干净 内在就无法成为真正的淑女
You know you can't be a nice girl inside if you're dirty outside.

454
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,410
我将你安置在这里 这是你的卧房
l'll have to put you in here. This will be your bedroom.

455
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,810
哦，我不能睡在这里，小姐
Oh, l couldn't sleep in here, Missus.

456
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,850
这房间对我来说太好了
lt's too good for the likes o' me.

457
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,080
我不敢碰任何东西
l should be afraid to touch anythin'.

458
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,090
毕竟我现在还不是女公爵
l ain't a duchess yet, you know.

459
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,270
这是什么？洗衣服的吗？
What's this? This where you wash clothes?

460
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,900
这是我们洗澡用的，伊莱沙 我正要给你洗澡
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza. And where l'm going to wash you.

461
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,440
你要我在里面洗澡？我不干！
You expect me to get into that and wet meself all over? Not me!

462
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
除非我死了
l shall catch me death.

463
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,350
来吧
Come along now.

464
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,090
来吧
Come along.

465
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,220
把衣服脱了
Take your clothes off.

466
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,470
快点，你听到了，脱掉衣服 来，帮我脱掉...
Come on, girl, do as you're told. Take your clothes off. Here, come on. Help me take these....

467
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:53,030
我不要...不要碰我！
Take your hands off me!

468
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,280
放开我

469
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:12,530
不...不要

470
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,960
我是个好女孩！
l'm a good girl, l am !

471
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,830
这样不对！...
lt ain't right! lt ain't decent!

472
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,840
不要碰我！
Get your hands off me!

473
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,820
我是个好女孩！
l'm a good girl, l am!

474
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,600
原谅我的无礼，席根斯 我参予此事就要为那女孩负责
Forgive the bluntness, but if l'm to be in this business... l shall feel responsible for the girl.

475
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,370
我希望你非常清楚 不能占这女孩的便宜！
l hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.

476
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,140
那种事情？我可以保证
What, that thing? Sacred, l assure you.

477
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,240
拜托，席根斯 这可不是开玩笑的
Come now, you know what l mean. This is no trifling matter.

478
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,880
好的男人总是会吸引女人的
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

479
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,050
你遇到过这样的女人吗？
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

480
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,180
是的，常常碰到
Yes, very frequently.

481
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,660
我没有，我发现当一个女人 和我作朋友后
l haven't. l find that the moment l let a woman make friends with me...

482
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,330
她就会变得嫉妒，兴奋 多疑，讨人厌
she becomes jealous, exacting... suspicious and a damned nuisance.

483
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,700
当我和女人作朋友后 我就变得自私专制
l find the moment that l make friends with a woman l become selfish and tyrannical.

484
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,170
所以我现在还是一个老光棍 而且想一直这样下去
So here l am, a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so.

485
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,670
毕竟，平克林...
Well, after all, Pickering--

486
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:40,340
我只是个普通人，什么也不求
l'm an ordinary man Who desires nothing more

487
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,680
只求有个机会
Than just an ordinary chance

488
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,380
过他喜欢的生活方式 做他想作的事
To live exactly as he likes And do precisely what he wants

489
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,620
我是一个很普通的人
An average man am l

490
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,690
不会离经叛道
Of no eccentric whim

491
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,550
喜欢过自己的生活
Who likes to live his life

492
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,160
自由地争论
Free of strife

493
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,230
照他自己的想法去做
Doing whatever he thinks is best for him

494
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,700
哦，我只是个普通人
Oh, just an ordinary man

495
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,540
如果让女人进入你的生命

00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,690
只要一点点好运气！
With a little bit o'bloomin'luck!

627
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,230
哦，男人风流是罪恶的
Oh, it's a crime for a man To go philanderin'

628
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,710
害可怜的太太悲痛忧伤
And fill his wife's poor 'eart With grief and doubt

629
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:14,850
哦，男人风流是项罪恶 但只要一点点运气...
Oh, it's a crime for a man To go philanderin', but With a little bit o'luck With a little bit o'luck

630
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,220
太太永远不会发现！
You can see the bloodhounds Don't find out!

631
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,720
只要一点点
With a little bit

632
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,450
只要一点点
With a little bit

633
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,700
只要一点点运气 太太永远不会发现！
With a little bit o'luck She won't find out!

634
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,370
只要一点点
With a little bit

635
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,370
只要一点点好运气！
With a little bit o'bloomin'luck!

636
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,980
只要一点点好运气！
With a little bit o'bloomin'luck!

637
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,050
邮件，先生
The mail, sir.

638
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,760
把帐单付了 然后回拒所有的邀请
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

639
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,870
你不能对女孩这样做
You simply cannot go on working the girl this way.

640
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:47,140
要她一直练习 每天从早到晚都在语言练习
Making her say her alphabet over and over... from sunup to sundown, even during meals.

641
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,810
你会累坏，何时可以停下来？
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

642
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,120
等她发音正确为止 还有事吗，皮尔斯太太？
When she does it properly, of course. ls that all, Mrs. Pearce?

643
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,090
这封信是美国百万富翁 以斯拉寄来的
There's another letter from that American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

644
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,390
他还是希望你 为道德改革会工作
He still wants you for his Moral Reform League.

645
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,550
把它丢了
Throw it away.

646
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,120
这是第三封了 至少你该回封信吧
lt's the third letter he's written you, sir. You should at least answer it.

647
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,860
好，放在书桌上，皮尔斯太太 我会试着回信
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce. l'll try an' get to it.

648
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,370
如果可以，先生 楼下有清洁工亚尔杜立特尔
lf you please, sir. There's a dustman downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

649
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,450
想要见你 他说他的女儿在这里
who wants to see you. He says you have his daughter here.

650
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,710
去！我说！
Phew! l say!

651
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,610
叫那个无赖上来，亚当
Well, send the blackguard up.

652
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,050
他可能不是无赖，席根斯
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

653
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,810
哦，他毫无疑问地是无赖 平克林
Oh, nonsense. O' course he's a blackguard, Pickering.

654
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,290
我怕他是来找麻烦的
l'm afraid we'll have some trouble with him.

655
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,230
不，不会的 是我找他麻烦不是他找我
No, l think not. Any trouble to be had, he'll have it with me. Not l with him.

656
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,570
这位是杜立特尔，先生
Doolittle, sir.

657
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,170
席根斯教授？ 在这里！
-Professor 'lggins? -Here!

658
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,270
在哪里？
Where?

659
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,710
早安，先生
Good morning, Governor.

660
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,210
我是为一件重要的事而来 先生
l come about a very serious matter, Governor.

661
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,710
在宏士罗洛长大的
Brought up in Houndslow.

662
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,220
我想你母亲是威尔斯人
Mother Welsh, l should think.

663
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,880
你要干什么？杜立特尔先生
What is it you want, Doolittle?

664
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,390
我要我女儿，懂吗？
l want my daughter, that's what l want. See?

665
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,120
你当然是要你女儿 你是她父亲，对吧？
Of course you do. You're her father, aren't you?

666
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,830
我很高兴你对家人还有感情
l'm glad to see you have a spark of family feeling left.

667
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,560
她在里面，可以马上带她走
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

668
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,760
什么？
What?

669
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,970
把她带走，我才不替你养女儿
Take her away. Do you think l am going to keep your daughter for you?

670
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,140
这样合理吗？
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

671
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,340
这样占一个人便宜公平吗？
ls it fairity to take advantage of a man like that?

672
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,780
这女孩属于我，你却得到她 我该怎么办？
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er. Where do l come in?

673
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,920
你竟然敢来这里企图勒索我！
How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me!

674
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,080
你故意送她到这里来！
You sent her here on purpose!

675
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,890
别这样刁难人，先生
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

676
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:46,700
警察应该逮捕你 这是个勒索计划
The police shall take you up. This is a plan... a plot to extort money by threats.

677
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,430
我应该打电话报警
l shall telephone the police.

678
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,830
我有向你要钱了吗？
Have l asked you for a brass farthin'?

679
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,610
我们可以问这位先生 我提到了钱吗？
l leave it to this gentleman 'ere. Have l said a word about money?

680
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,980
那你来干什么？
Well, what else did you come for?

681
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,350
我能干什么 有点人情味嘛，先生
What would a bloke come for? Be 'uman, Governor.

682
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,430
亚尔，你故意把她送来这里
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

683
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,190
拜托，先生，我从未这样做
So help me, Governor, l never did.

684
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,490
那你怎么知道她在这里？
Then how did you know she was here?

685
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,530
我正要告诉你，先生 如果你让我说的话
l'd tell you, Governor, if you'd only let me get a word in.

686
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:23,800
我会告诉你，我要告诉你 我等着要告诉你！
l'm willing to tell ya. l'm wanting to tell ya. l'm waiting to tell ya !

687
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:29,240
平克林 这就是特定的自然修辞法
You know, Pickering, this chap's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

688
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,550
注意他说话的原始韵律
Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.

689
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,650
“我会告诉你，我要告诉你 我等着要告诉你”
''l'm willing to tell you. l'm wanting to tell you. l'm waiting to tell you.''

690
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,010
他说的是威尔斯腔调
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

691
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,880
如果不是你叫伊莱莎来 你怎么知道她在这里？
How did you know Eliza was here if you didn't send 'er?

692
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:45,450
她叫人回来拿她的行李 而我碰巧听到了
Well, she sent back for her luggage and l got to 'ear about it.

693
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,290
她说她不要衣服了
She said she didn't want no clothes.

694
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,730
我会怎么想？我问你 我是父亲，我该怎么想？
What was l to think from that, Governor? l ask you, as a parent, what was l to think?

695
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,870
所以你是来这里救她的？
So you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?

696
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,540
是的，先生，没错 是
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right. -Yes.

697
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,410
皮尔斯太太！
Mrs. Pearce!

698
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,870
皮尔斯太太
Mrs. Pearce!

699
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,280
伊莱沙的父亲来带她了 把她交给他，好吗？
Eliza's father has come to take her away. Give her to him, will you?

700
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,780
等一下，先生，等一下
Now wait a minute, Governor. Wait a minute.

701
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,420
你和我都是这世上的男人吧 不是吗？
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

702
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,980
这世上的男人吧，是吗？ 皮尔太太你最好快走
Men of the world, are we? Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

703
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,580
我也是这么想，先生！
l think so indeed, sir!

704
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:25,870
先生，我对你很有好感...
Here, Governor. l've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

705
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,540
如果你要这个女孩 我就不带她走了...
if you want the girl, l ain't so set on 'avin' her back home again...

706
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,580
但是我有些事情要解决
but what l might be open to is an arrangement.

707
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,410
我所要求的是父亲的权利
All l ask is my rights as a father.

708
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:42,140
你一定不希望我 毫无代价地就让她离开我
You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.

709
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,720
我看得出你是很正直的人 先生
l can see you're o' the straight sort, Governor.

710
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,020
所以...
So...

711
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,920
5英镑对你有无差吧 伊莱莎对我也无差
what's a five pound note to you? An' what's Eliza to me?

712
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,220
我想你应该知道，杜立特尔...
l think you ought to know, Doolittle...

713
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,350
席根斯先生的用意是很崇高的
that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable.

714
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,730
当然，先生 否则我要50英镑
Of course they are, Governor. lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.

715
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,070
你是说你用50英镑卖女儿？
Do you mean to say you'd sell your daughter for 50 pounds?

716
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,900
你没道德良心吗？
Have you no morals, man?

717
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,740
如果你跟我一样穷 你也会没有的，先生
No, l can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me.

718
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,280
我没有恶意，但...
Not that l mean any 'arm, mind ya, but...

719
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,940
如果伊莱沙可以 为何我不可以呢？
if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this, why not me, too?

720
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,250
为何？
Why not?

721
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,790
那么...
Well, look....

722
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,820
用我的观点来看 我算什么了？
Look at it my way. What am l?

723
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,760
我问你我算什么？ 我是毫无价值的穷人，就是我
l ask ya, what am l? l'm one o' the undeserving poor, that's what l am.

724
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,860
想想看这对人的意义
Now think what that means to a man.

725
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,670
意思是他一生都在对抗 中等阶级的道德观
lt means he's up against middle-class morality for all the time.

726
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,000
如果任何情况发生了 永远都会有一样结果
lf there's anything goin' an' l puts in for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

727
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,340
你没有价值，所以不能给你
''You're undeservin', so you can't have it.''

728
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:49,070
但我需要的钱 和寡妇需要的是一样
But my needs is as great as the most deservin' widows that ever got money...

729
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,380
她是从过世的丈夫身份 得来的救济金
out of six different charities in one week for the death o' the same 'usband.

730
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:57,280
我需要的不比别人少 我需要的更多
l don't need less than a deservin' man, l need more.

731
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,750
我吃的不少，并且爱喝酒...
l don't eat less 'earty than he does and l drink...

732
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,660
喝很多
a lot more.

733
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,790
我就跟你直话直说
l'm playin' straight with you.

734
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,900
我不打算假装我应得 不，我是不应该这样
l ain't pretendin' to be deservin'. No, l'm undeservin'...

735
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,140
而我就是没有价值 我喜欢，这是事实
and l mean to go on bein' undeservin'. l like it an' that's the truth.

736
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,100
但是你会占人便宜吗...
But will you take advantage of a man's nature...

737
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:23,350
我好不容易把她扶养长大 为她做了一切...
do him out of the price of his own daughter, what he's brought up... fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow...

738
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,980
直到现在 她大到可以吸引你们两位
till she's growed big enough to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

739
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:34,230
5英镑不合理吗，看你们了？
ls five pounds unreasonable, l put it to you?

740
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,260
我把问题交给你
And l leave it to you.

741
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:42,660
平克林 如果我们若训练他三个月...
You know, Pickering, if we took this man in hand for three months...

742
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:46,640
他就能在内阁或教区间 选个职位
he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

743
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,310
我们最好给他5英镑 他会滥用这些钱
-We'd better give 'im a fiver. -He'll make bad use of it, l'm afraid.

744
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,440
不会的，先生，相信我不会
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me l won't.

745
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:56,040
这只是我和内人喝酒的钱...
Just one good spree for meself an' the missus...

746
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:59,090
带给自己欢乐 和别人工作的机会
givin' pleasure to ourselves and employment to others.

747
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:03,950
你该满意钱不会被浪费 这是最好的选择
An' satisfaction to you to know it ain't been throwed away. You couldn't spend it better.

748
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,320
哦，真难拒绝 给他1 0英镑好了
Oh, this is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

749
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,330
不行
No

750
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,360
内人不知道要如何花1 0英镑 先生
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart to spend ten, Governor.

751
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,130
1 0英镑太多了
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

752
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,790
那会让人审慎考虑 不再快乐了
Makes a man feel prudent-like, and then goodbye to 'appiness.

753
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,040
你只要给我5英镑，不多不少
No, you just give me what l ask, Governor. Not a penny less, not a penny more.

754
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,640
我很想插手管这件不道德的事 杜立特尔
l rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

755
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,800
你为何不跟她结婚呢？
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

756
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:28,210
毕竟婚姻不可怕 何况你和伊莱沙母亲结过婚
After all, marriage isn't so frightening. You married Eliza's mother.

757
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,010
谁说的，先生？
Who told you that, Governor?

758
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,950
没人告诉我是 是我自己想到的...
Well, nobody told me. l concluded, naturally....

759
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,220
如果他再说一分钟 我们就没有信心了
lf we listen to this man for another minute we shall have no convictions left.

760
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,230
你说的5英镑 谢谢，先生
-Five pounds, l think you said. -Thank you, Governor.

761
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,800
确定不要1 0英镑？
Are you sure you won't have ten?

762
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,200
不...或许下次好了
No. No, perhaps another time.

763
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,370
对不起，小姐
l beg your pardon, Miss.

764
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:53,240
我不要再说这些母音了
l won't say those ruddy vowels one more time.

765
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,970
我的天啊，是伊莱莎
Blimey, it's Eliza.

766
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,840
我从不知道她弄干净之后 会这么漂亮
Well, l never thought she'd clean up so good-looking.

767
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,940
真是我的光荣，不是吗，先生
She does me credit, don't she, Governor?

768
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,540
等等，你来这里干什么？
Here! What are you doin' here?

769
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,110
你不要说了，别让他们看笑话
Now, you hold your tongue and don't you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

770
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,990
如果她惹了什么麻烦 只要剥掉她的衣服就好
lf you have any trouble with 'er, give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

771
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,390
那就会督促她
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

772
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,190
早安，各位，再见，伊莱莎
Well, good morning, gentlemen. Cheerio, Eliza.

773
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,770
这人很会说话，天分很高
There's a man for you. A philosophical genius of the first water.

774
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,640
皮尔斯太太 写信给以拉斯先生告诉他...
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford and tell him...

775
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,010
如果他要找人演讲 请他找亚尔杜立特尔
if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

776
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,010
一位普通的清洁工 说他是英国最好的道德家之一
a common dustman, one o' the most original moralists in England.

777
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,810
是的
Yes

778
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,140
他来干嘛？
'Ere, what did he come for?

779
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,240
去念你的母音
Say your vowels.

780
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,380
我早知道那些母音了
l know me vowels. l knew 'em before l come.

781
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:41,790
如果你知道你念出来呀
lf you know them, say them.

782
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,950
Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.

783
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,230
A, E, l, O, U.

784
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,560
我是这么说的啊...
That's what l said. Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.

785
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,260
我已经说了三天 我不想再说了
That's what l been sayin' for three days an' l won't say 'em no more.

786
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,360
我知道这很难，杜立特尔小姐 但请试着了解
l know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle, but try to understand.

787
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:01,000
不需要解释 身为军人你该了解
There's no use explaining. As a military man you ought to know that.

788
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:05,080
她需要训练 你不要管她，不必同情她
Drilling is what she needs. Leave her alone or she'll be turning to you for sympathy.

789
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,240
好吧，席根斯，这需要耐心
Very well, if you insist, but have a little patience with her.

790
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,540
当然
Of course.

791
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,580
念“A”
Say ''A.''

792
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,880
你真没良心
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

793
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,660
伊莱莎 我相信你今天会念好的...
l promise you you'll say your vowels correctly before this day is out...

794
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,800
否则没有午餐 晚餐和巧克力吃
or there'll be no lunch, no dinner, and no chocolates.

795
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:45,180
等着看，席根斯，等着看
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait

796
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,420
你会后悔 但你流泪也来不及了
You'll be sorry But your tears will be too late

797
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,990
你会破产，我有钱也不借你 要我帮你？别指望！
You'll be broke and l'll have money Will l help you? Don't be funny!

798
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,290
等着看，席根斯，等着看
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait

799
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,800
等着看，席根斯，等你生病时
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Till you're sick

800
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,300
你会大叫要我赶快去请医生
And you screams To fetch a doctor double-quick

801
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:13,210
我会马上走开，上街去看戏
l'll be off a second later And go straight to the theater

802
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:16,280
啊哈，席根斯，等着看
Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait!

803
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,010
席根斯
'Enry 'lggins

804
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,790
等到我们在海中游泳时
Just you wait Until we're swimmin'in the sea

805
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,590
席根斯
'Enry 'lggins

806
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,190
你在我伸手可及的地方抽筋
And you get the cramp A little ways from me

807
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:39,440
当你要溺死前大叫救命时 我立刻上岸穿衣进城玩乐
When you yell you're gonna drown l'll get dressed and go to town

808
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,630
哈哈哈，席根斯
'Enry 'lggins

809
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,300
哈哈哈，席根斯
'Enry 'lggins

810
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,250
我们等着看！
Just you wait!

811
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:56,450
有一天，我会成名 有教养又高尚
One day l'll be famous l'll be proper and prim

812
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,520
时常上圣杰姆斯教堂 因而称它为圣杰姆
Go to St. James so often l will call it St. Jim

813
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,860
在一晚，国王会对我说 伊莱沙，老朋友
One evening the King will say ''Oh, Liza, old thing

814
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:14,200
我要全英格兰为你而歌唱
''l want all of England Your praises to sing

815
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:18,840
下星期，五月二十日
''Next week on the 20th of May

816
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,880
我宣布为伊莱沙杜立特尔日
''l proclaim Liza Doolittle Day

817
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:29,250
全民会为你的荣耀而庆祝
''All the people will celebrate The glory of you

818
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:34,850
不论你希望什么，或要什么 我都很高兴替你办
''And whatever you wish and want l gladly will do''

819
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:41,060
谢谢你，吾王 我会非常有教养的说
''Thanks a lot, King, '' says l ln a manner well-bred

820
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:46,160
我只要亨利席根斯的人头
''But all l want is 'Enry 'lggins' 'ead''

821
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:48,130
就这么办！
''Done!''

822
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,440
国王马上就说了
Says the King with a stroke

823
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,040
卫兵们，赶快逮捕那家伙归案
''Guard, run and bring in the bloke''

824
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:00,220
然后卫兵就会押着你来到刑场
Then they'll march you, 'Enry 'lggins To the wall

825
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:03,050
国王告诉我
And the King will tell me

826
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,250
伊莱沙，发号施令
''Liza, sound the call''

827
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,130
当他们高举步枪
As they raise their rifles higher

828
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,860
我喊着：准备，瞄准，射击！
l'll shout.: ''Ready, aim, fire!''

829
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:20,240
啊哈哈，亨利席根斯，死得好
Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins Down you go

830
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,240
我们等着看！
Just you wait!

831
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,750
好了，伊莱沙，再说一遍
All right, Eliza, say it again.

832
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:11,390
斯般牙的鱼大多数刺在瓶员上
''The rine in Spine... ''stais minely in the pline.''

833
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:15,990
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
''The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.''

834
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:17,560
我不是这么“塞”的吗？
Didn't l saiy that?

835
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:20,830
不，伊莱沙，你没“塞” 你根本不会“说”
No, Eliza, you didn't ''saiy'' that. You didn't even ''say'' that.

836
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:26,200
你每晚上床睡觉前 你就祷告说
Every night before you get into bed, where you used to say your prayers... l want you to say:

837
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,640
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
''The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.''

838
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,900
50遍
Fifty times.

839
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:35,210
你会更接近上帝的 因为他会被你吵死
You'll get much further with the Lord if you learn not to offend His ears.

840
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,750
现在练习你的“H”
Now for your ''H's.''

841
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,020
平克林，你会被气死
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

842
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,320
耐心点，席根斯 给这孩子一个机会
Control yourself, Higgins. Give the girl a chance.

843
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,150
我想你无法期待她 第一次就办得到
l suppose you can't expect her to get it right the first time.

844
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,290
来，伊莱沙，注意看
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

845
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,430
看见火火焰了吗？
Now, you see that flame?

846
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,490
你发音正确时这火焰会升起
Every time you pronounce the letter ''H'' correctly the flame will waver...

847
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,670
如果错了，这火焰就不会动
and every time you drop your ''H'' the flame will remain stationary.

848
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,270
这样就知道是否正确
That's how to know you've done it correctly.

849
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,240
同时你会听到不同的地方
ln time, your ear will hear the difference.

850
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,980
你看镜子里面的火焰 注意听了
You'll see it better in the mirror. Now listen carefully.

851
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,010
在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡
''ln Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

852
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:16,380
没有发生飓风
''hurricanes hardly ever happen.''

853
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,760
跟着我念
Now you repeat that after me.

854
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,790
在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡，没有发生飓风
''ln Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen.''

855
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,000
在喝特福特，呵里福 和含普郡，没有花生居风
''ln 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire 'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen.''

856
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,800
哦，不，不是！
Oh, no, no, no!

857
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,740
你都没在听吗？
Have you no ear at all?

858
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:34,930
要再一次吗？ 不要了
-Should l do it over? -No, please.

859
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,900
从头开始，像这样
Start from the very beginning. Just do this.

860
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,280
继续...
Go on, go on, go on.

861
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,420
这和印度语言发音是一样吗？
Does the same thing hold true in lndia?

862
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,560
他们也把多余的音省略 像H音就省略
Have they the peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter...

863
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:01,970
但是用到不该用的地方 很多就错了
but using it where it doesn't belong, like ''hever'' instead of ''ever''?

864
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:08,940
他们不明白发音倾向常发错音

865
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,710
很多都不对 常把“歌唱者”的音念错

866
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:18,080
这和开始学发音的方法有关吧

867
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:27,190
那女孩，席根斯！
The girl, Higgins!

868
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,490
继续...
Go on. Go on.

869
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:33,300
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

870
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,670
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

871
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:43,210
早晚都在工作
Night and day he slaves away

872
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,540
哦，可怜的席根斯教授
Oh, poor Professor Higgins

873
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:57,390
从早到晚在马不停蹄的工作
All day long on his feet Up and down until he's numb

874
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:05,060
从不休息...手忙到麻木
Doesn't rest, doesn't eat Doesn't touch a crumb

875
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,400
再一次，伊莱莎
Again, Eliza.

876
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:13,610
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

877
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,540
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

878
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:20,170
不，你太好了...
No. Kind of you. Kind of you. Kind--

879
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:23,370
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

880
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,910
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

881
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,350
你太好了...像是一杯茶
Kind of you. Kind of you. lt's like ''cup of tea.''

882
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,980
你太好了...一杯茶，说一杯茶
Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, say ''cup of tea.''

883
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,480
一坏茶
Cuppatea.

884
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,890
不是，一杯茶
No. ''A cup of tea.''

885
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:39,600
这些蛋糕真好吃 不知道皮尔斯太太哪里买的
lt's awfully good cake. l wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

886
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,960
一流的，草莓馅的真好吃 想吃一块吗？
First rate. And those strawberry tarts are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

887
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,080
再试一遍
Try it again.

888
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,150
你想试... 平克林！
-Did you try the-- -Pickering!

889
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,010
再试一遍，伊莱莎
Again, Eliza.

890
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,350
一坏茶
Cuppatea.

891
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,510
哦，不
Oh, no.

892
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,580
你难道不能分别不同的地方？
Can't you hear the difference?

893
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:06,560
把舌放下，压到下方的牙齿
Look, put your tongue forward until it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

894
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,120
然后说，杯
And then say ''cup.''

895
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:10,750
杯
 ''cup.''

896
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,230
说，一
Then say ''of.''

897
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:18,700
然后说， “一杯...”
Then say ''cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of.''

898
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:21,370
天啊，席根斯，这茶真好喝
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

899
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:24,500
你把最后一块吃掉吧 我吃不下了
You finish the last strawberry tart. l couldn't eat another thing.

900
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:26,710
我不能吃了 浪费了可惜
-l couldn't touch it. -Shame to waste it.

901
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:31,680
哦，我不会浪费 我知道有人会喜欢草莓馅
Oh, it won't be wasted. l know somebody who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

902
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:45,230
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

903
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:48,800
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

904
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:55,100
他总是辛勤的工作
On he plods against all odds

905
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:59,740
哦，可怜的席根斯教授
Oh, poor Professor Higgins

906
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:04,650
晚上九点，晚上十点
Nine p.m., ten p.m.

907
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,050
每晚都工作到午夜
On through midnight every night

908
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:14,620
凌晨一点，凌晨二点，三点...
One a.m., two a.m., three....

909
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,160
Four.

910
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,160
Five.

911
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,100
6颗
Six marbles.

912
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,430
我要你念这个 我要你发出音来...
l want you to read this and l want you to enunciate...

913
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:29,980
假装嘴里没有东西念出来
every word just as if the marbles were not in your mouth.

914
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:33,710
花盆里有着最黑的地衣
''With blackest moss, the flower pots...

915
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,510
全部都有厚厚地外壳
''were thickly crusted, one and all.''

916
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,550
清楚的念出每个字
Each word, clear as a bell.

917
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:43,560
花盆里有着最黑的...
''With blackest moss the flower...

918
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,850
地衣
''pots.''

919
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,320
我不行！
l can't!

920
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,590
我不行！
l can't!

921
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,860
席根斯，嘴里有必要含东西吗
l say, Higgins, are those pebbles really necessary?

922
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:55,460
如果狄摩西尼斯这样做 伊莱沙就必须如此做
lf they were necessary for Demosthenes they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

923
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:56,900
继续，伊莱莎
Go on, Eliza.

924
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:01,400
花盆里有着最黑的地衣...
''With the blackest moss the flower pots...

925
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:04,600
全部都有厚厚地外壳
''were thickly crusted one and all.''

926
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,810
我一个字都听不懂
l can't understand a word, not a word.

927
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,880
花盆里有着最黑的地衣...
''With blackest moss, the flower pots...

928
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,650
全部都有厚厚地外壳
''were thickly crusted, one and all.''

929
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,550
或许这首诗太难了
Perhaps the poem is a little too difficult for the girl.

930
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,120
为何不要她念些简单的文章
Why don't you try something simpler, like The Owl and the Pussycat?

931
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,350
真是太可爱了
Yes, that's a charming one.

932
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,590
平克林，我听不见她说的话！
Pickering, l can't hear a word the girl is saying!

933
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:30,960
怎么了？
What's the matter?

934
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,370
我吞了一个
l swallowed one.

935
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:37,440
没关系，还很多 张开嘴， 1 ， 2...
lt doesn't matter. l've got plenty more. Open your mouth. One, two--

936
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:43,850
放弃吧，席根斯教授
Quit, Professor Higgins

937
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:47,940
放弃吧，席根斯教授
Quit, Professor Higgins

938
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:53,390
听我们的请求 否则我们会辞职
Hear our plea, or payday we will quit

939
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:56,160
席根斯教授！
Professor Higgins!

940
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:01,000
“艾”不是“爱” “又”不是“欧”
''Ay''not ''l'', ''O''not ''ow''

941
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,440
脑袋全都是回声
Pounding, pounding in our brain

942
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,940
“艾”不是“爱” “又”不是“欧”
''Ay''not ''l, '' ''O''not ''ow''

943
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,140
别说“鱼”要说“雨”
Don't say ''rine'' say ''rain ''

944
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,850
西班牙的雨...
''The rain in Spain...

945
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:24,120
不断落在原野上
''stays mainly in the plain.''

946
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:30,760
我不行，我太累了！...
l can't! l'm so tired! l'm so tired.

947
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:36,240
天啊，席根斯 现是零晨三点，讲点道理
For God's sake, Higgins, it must be three o'clock in the morning. Do be reasonable.

948
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:39,330
我一向都很讲理
l am always reasonable.

949
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:46,250
伊莱莎，如果我可以忍受头痛 你也可以
Eliza, if l can go on with a blistering headache, you can.

950
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:49,410
但我头很痛
l got a 'eadache, too.

951
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:55,250
我知道你头痛，你累了
l know your head aches. l know you're tired.

952
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,520
我知道你的神经紧张的 像是粘板上的肉
l know your nerves are as raw as meat in a butcher's window.

953
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:05,100
但是想想看你要完成的事情
But think what you're trying to accomplish.

954
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,800
想想你所要面对的事情
Just think what you're dealing with.

955
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:16,240
庄严华丽的英语 是我们拥有最伟大的财产
The majesty and grandeur of the English language.... lt's the greatest possession we have.

956
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:20,380
人们从内心传达出高贵思想
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed through the hearts of men...

957
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,950
是包含了不凡的想像力 和音乐混合的声音
are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative... and musical mixtures of sounds.

958
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:31,890
这就是你所要克服完成的 伊莱莎
And that's what you've set yourself out to conquer, Eliza.

959
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,590
克服它，你可以办到的
And conquer it you will.

960
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,150
现在再试一遍
Now try it again.

961
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:15,830
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
''The rain in Spain... ''stays mainly in the plain.''

962
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,000
你说什么
What was that?

963
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:32,550
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
''The rain in Spain... ''stays mainly in the plain.''

964
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,150
再一次
Again.

965
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:47,660
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

966
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,970
我想她学会了...
l think she's got it l think she's got it

967
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:55,700
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

968
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:58,940
天啊，她学会了...
By George, she's got it By George, she's got it

969
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,240
现在，再一次，雨下在哪儿？
Now once again Where does it rain?

970
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:05,550
在平原上...
On the plain, on the plain

971
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,650
那个潮湿的平原又在哪儿？
And where's that soggy plain?

972
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,920
在西班牙...
ln Spain, in Spain

973
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:16,460
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

974
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,190
好极了

975
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:23,240
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

976
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:28,070
在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡
ln Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

977
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:31,010
没有发生飓风
Hurricanes hardly happen

978
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,150
你让我来真是太好了
How kind of you to let me come

979
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,240
再说一次，雨落在哪儿？
Now once again Where does it rain?

980
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,480
在平原上...
On the plain, on the plain

981
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:46,560
那该死的平原又在哪儿？
And where's that blasted plain?

982
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:49,890
在西班牙...
ln Spain, in Spain

983
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,960
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

984
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:01,540
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

985
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,500
上校，来，来

986
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,120
平克林
Pickering.

987
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:50,980
我们的进展很好，平克林 是出去试试她训练成果的时候
We're making fine progress, Pickering. l think the time has come to try her out.

988
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,750
你们还好吧，席根斯先生？
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?

989
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,420
我很好，你呢？
Yes, l'm feeling fine. How are you?

990
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:56,890
很好，谢谢 很好
-Very well, thank you. -Good.

991
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,730
让我们到公共场合 看看她的进展
Let's test her in public and see how she fares.

992
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:03,700
席根斯先生 我被很大的声响给吵醒
Mr. Higgins, l was awakened by a dreadful pounding.

993
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,170
你知道是什么声音吗？
Do you know what it might have been?

994
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,500
我没听见，你有听见吗 平克林？
l didn't hear any pounding. Did you, Pickering?

995
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,440
没有啊
No

996
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,940
如果继续听到，皮尔斯太太 你最好去看医生
lf this goes on, Mrs. Pearce, you'd better see a doctor.

997
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,880
有了，我们带她去看赛马 赛马？
-l know. We'll take her to the races. -The races?

998
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,710
我母亲在阿斯科特赛马场 有个包箱
My mother's box at Ascot.

999
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,940
你会先去问你母亲吧 当然会了
-You'll consult your mother first. -Yes, of course.

1000
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,750
不，我们还是给她个惊喜 我们现在睡觉吧
No, l think we'd better surprise her. Now let's go to bed.

1001
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,760
明天一早，我们帮她买衣服
First thing in the morning, we'll go out and buy her a dress.

1002
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,490
继续加油，伊莱沙
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1003
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,590
但是席根斯先生 现在是凌晨了
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1004
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,190
有比凌晨更好的工作时段吗？
What better time to work than early in the morning?

1005
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,970
哪里可以买到女人的外衣？
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1006
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,330
当然是怀特利街
Whitely's, of course.

1007
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,530
你怎么会知道？
How do you know that?

1008
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,900
这是常识啊

我们不要买太花的衣服
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1010
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,580

l despise those gowns with, sort of, weeds here and weeds there.

1011
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:52,680
我们帮她买简单合适又高雅的 就是这样
We'll buy something sort of simple and modest... and elegant. That's what's called for.

01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,080
或许这儿有个蝴蝶结

1013

Eliza, l don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

你要把书放下，去睡觉吧
You must put down your books and go to bed.

1017

Bed! Bed! l couldn't go to bed

1018
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:16,570
我的头太轻了，无法躺下
My head's too light to try to set it down

1019
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:22,810
睡觉！睡觉！我今晚无法成眠
Sleep! Sleep! l couldn't sleep tonight

1020
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:27,250
就算有皇冠上 全部的珠宝也睡不着！
Not for all the jewels in the crown!

1021
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,220

1024
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,960
我可以展翼高飞
l could have spread my wings

1025
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:48,240
做各式各样
And done a thousand things

1026
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:54,580
我从没做过的事
l've never done before

1027

我从不知何事令我如此兴奋

1028
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:07,420
突然之间我心飞扬

我只知道，当他开始与我共舞

你该同意了吧？
Don't you agree now?

1033
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,760
她应该上床了！
She ought to be in bed!

1034

我可以整晚跳舞

我从没做过的事

我从不知何事令我如此兴奋
l'll never know what made it so exciting

1041
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:25,840
突然之间我心飞扬
Why all at once my heart took flight

1042

我只知道，当他开始与我跳舞

所有该来的人都来了
Everyone who should be here is here

1058
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:52,380
阿斯科特赛马的开赛日 真是星光耀眼
What a smashing, positively dashing Spectacle, the Ascot opening day

1059
01:21:52,480 --> 01:22:00,320
与赛的马匹都准备好了 只等着开跑的哨音
At the gate are all the horses Waiting for the cue to fly away

1060
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:08,460
真是一个引人入胜的 阿斯科特赛马开赛日
What a gripping, absolutely ripping Moment at the Ascot opening day

1061
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,260
脉搏，急促
Pulses rushing

1062
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:16,170
颜面，变红
Faces flushing

1063
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:20,110
心跳，加快
Heartbeats speed up

1064
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:23,270
我从未如此激动过！
l have never been so keyed up!

1065
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,250
时间就快到了
Any second now

1066
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:28,110
要开始赛马了
They'll begin to run

1067
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:32,650
听！哨音响起 马匹冲出来，看！
Hark! A bell is ringing They are springing forward, look!

1068
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,620
开始了
lt has begun

1069
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:10,050
真是令人屏息待静 速度如此之快
What a frenzied moment that was Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?

1070
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:18,360
真是一个紧张刺激的 阿斯科特赛马开赛日
lt was a thrilling, absolutely chilling Running of the Ascot opening race!

1071
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,220
母亲！
Mother!

1072
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:51,150
亨利！真是令人意料之外
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

1073
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:54,160
你好，母亲，你真漂亮
Hello, Mother. How nice you look.

1074
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,560
你到这里干嘛？ 你保证不会来此的，快回家去
What are you doing here? You promised never to come to Ascot. Go home.

1075
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,190
不行，我来这里有事情要办
l can't. l'm here on business.

1076
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,130
不可以，我说真的 你会得罪我所有的朋友
No, you must. l'm quite serious. You offend all my friends.

1077
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,670
他们一看到你 我就别想再看到他们了
The moment they meet you l never see them again.

1078
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,330
更何况看看你的服装
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

1079
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,970
我可以换，母亲 我有件事情要你做
l changed my shirt. Mother, l've got a job for you.

1080
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,670
这是语言学的事情 我选了个女孩
A phonetics job. l've picked up a girl.

1081
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,580
亨利
Henry!

1082
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,670
哦，不，不是谈恋爱 她是个卖花女
Oh, no, not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1083
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:18,220
我想要带她去大使舞会 但是我想先测试一下
l'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball but l wanted to try her out first.

1084
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,750
你说什么？ 你知道大使舞会的
-l beg your pardon? -Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1085
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,050
我当然知道

1086
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,680
所以我今天请她来你的包厢 懂了吗？
So l invited her to your box today, do you understand?

1087
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,390
一个卖花女？
Common flower girl?

1088
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,500
没问题，我教过她如何说话
l taught her how to speak properly.

1089
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,860
她的行为会非常得宜
She has strict instructions as to her behavior.

1090
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:34,090
她只会谈两个主题 天气和大家的健康
She's to keep to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.

1091
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:37,600
“天气真好”和 “你好” 不要让她讲到太广泛的事情
''Fine day! '' and ''How do you do?'' Not just let herself go on things in general.

1092
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,730
帮她的忙，你们会很安全的
Help her along, darling. You'll be quite safe.

1093
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,040
安全？ 在赛马期间谈论我们的健康？
Safe? To talk about one's health in the middle of a race?

1094
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,170
她总得谈些什么吧
Well, she's got to talk about something.

1095
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,470
她现在在哪里？
Where is the girl now?

1096
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:48,610
她在整理服饰 她的衣服不太合身
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes we bought her didn't quite fit.

1097
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,240
我告诉平克林我们应该陪着她
l told Pickering we should have taken her with us.

1098
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:57,750
恩斯福特希尔夫人 午安，席根斯夫人
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill. -Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1099
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,790

You know my son, Henry.

1100
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,330

1101
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:04,730
我好像见过你 我不知道
-l've seen you somewhere before. -l don't know.

1102
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:07,130
没关系，你最好坐下吧
lt doesn't matter. You better sit down.

1103
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,530
他们到哪里去了？
Where the devil can they be?

1104
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:49,940
平克林上校 你正好赶上喝茶的时间
Colonel Pickering, you're just in time for tea.

1105
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:53,310
谢谢，席根斯夫人 容我介绍伊莱莎杜立特尔小姐
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins. May l introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1106
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,750
亲爱的，杜立特尔小姐
My dear, Miss Doolittle.

1107
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:57,550
你请我来真是太好了
How kind of you to let me come.

1108
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:58,980
我很高兴你能来
Delighted, my dear.

1109
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,750
巴克辛顿夫人 你好？

1110
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:04,190
你好
-How do you do?

1111
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,020
巴克辛顿阁下 你好？
-Lord Boxington. -How do you do?

1112
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,060
你好？
How do you do?

1113
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,060
恩斯福特夫人，杜立特尔小姐 你好？
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle. -How do you do?

1114
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:11,790
你好？
How do you do?

1115
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,770
还有佛雷狄恩斯福特希尔
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1116
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,500

How do you do?

1117
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,400
你好？
How do you do?

1118
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,270
杜立特尔小姐
Miss Doolittle.

1119
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:25,870
午安，席根斯教授
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1120
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:40,120
第一场赛马很刺激 杜立特尔小姐，可惜你错过了
The first race was very exciting, Miss Doolittle. l'm so sorry that you missed it.

1121
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,090
你认为会下雨吗？
Will it rain, do you think?

1122
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:46,700
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.

1123
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:57,200
但是在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡，没有发生飓风
But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1124
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,010
这真的很好笑
How awfully funny.

1125
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,650
有何不对，年轻人？ 我想我说对了
What is wrong with that, young man? l bet l got it right.

1126
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:03,880
真妙
Smashing.

1127
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,790
难道天气不会突然变冷吗？
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1128
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,820
我希望不会染上非季节性感冒
l do hope we won't have any unseasonable cold spells.

1129
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:12,890
否则会引起流行性感冒
They bring on so much influenza.

1130
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,730
我的家人会很容易染上
And the whole of our family is susceptible to it.

1131
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:20,630
他们是说我姑姑死于感冒
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1132
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:24,640
但我相信是他们解决了她
But it's my belief they done the old woman in.

1133
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:27,110
解决了她？
Done her in?

1134
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,340
是的，上帝爱你
Yes, Lord love you.

1135
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:32,010
她为什么会死于感冒...
Why should she die of influenza...

1136
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:35,610
一年前她得了白喉但痊愈了
when she come through diphtheria right enough the year before.

1137
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:38,520
她为此非常担忧
Fairly blue with it she was.

1138
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,890
他们都以为她死了
They all thought she was dead.

1139
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:45,430
但我父亲用汤匙装琴酒给她喝
But my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat.

1140
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:54,800
直到她咬断汤匙的把手
Then she come to so sudden she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1141
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,240
天啊！
Dear me!

1142
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:03,670
为何如此强壮的女人 会死于感冒？
Now what call would a woman with that strength in her... have to die of influenza?

1143
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:09,210
她该给我的新草帽下场呢？
And what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?

1144
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,250
有人偷走了
Somebody pinched it.

1145
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:20,720
我要说的是 他们偷走了，解决了她
And what l say is: Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1146
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,460
解决了她？你是这样说的吗？
Done her in? Done her in, did you say?

1147
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,260
这是什么意思？
Whatever does it mean?

1148
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:31,500
哦，这是新术语 解决某人的意思是杀了他们
Oh, that's the new small talk. ''To do somebody in'' means to kill them.

1149
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:35,130
但你不会相信 你姑姑是被杀的吧？
But you surely don't believe your aunt was killed?

1150
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,770
我不会吗？
Do l not?

1151
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:42,110
他们为了一根针都会杀她 更别说一顶帽子
Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1152
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:47,680
但你父亲不该拿酒喂她喝
But it can't have been right for your father... to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1153
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,450
这可能会杀了她
lt might have killed her.

1154
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,790
她不会，琴酒对她来说是母乳
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1155
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:59,560
而且他自己喝了更多
Besides, he poured so much down his own throat he knew the good of it.

1156
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,330
你是说他喝酒？
Do you mean that he drank?

1157
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,030
喝酒？这积习难改
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1158
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:11,570
你笑些什么？
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1159
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:15,310
那新术语，你说得真好
The new small talk. You do it so awfully well.

1160
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:19,750
如果我说的很恰当 那你笑个什么劲？
Well, if l was doing it proper, what was you sniggering at?

1161
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,450
我是否说了我不该说的吗？
Have l said anything l oughtn't?

1162
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,720
完全没有
Not at all, my dear.

1163
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,950
那就好
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1164
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:35,900
我不知道是否可以赶上 下一场下注但是走吧，亲爱的
l don't know if there's enough time before the next race to place a bet... but come, my dear.

1165
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:40,130
我下注七号 我很高兴能送给你
l have a bet on number seven. l should be so happy if you would take it.

1166
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,340
你会更喜欢这场赛马的
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1167
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,040
你人真好
That's very kind of you.

1168
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,270
它的名字叫多佛
His name is Dover.

1169
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,750
走吧，伊莱莎
Come along, Eliza.

1170
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:54,020
它们又来了，准备要起跑
There they are again Lining up to run

1171
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:58,550
它们屏息以待，准备好了，看
Now they're holding steady They are ready for it, look

1172
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:01,890
开始了
lt has begun

1173
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:09,470
加油...多佛
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1174
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,340
加油...多佛
Come on. Come on, Dover!

1175
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:14,440
加油！
Come on!

1176
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,410
快点，多佛！加速你的玻璃！
Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' ass!

1177
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:30,920
哦，亲爱的
Oh, my dear.

1178
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:49,740
你不是认真的吧，亨利 真的要带她去参加大使舞会
You're not serious, Henry. You don't expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1179
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,370
你认为她还没准备好？
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1180
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,850
亲爱的亨利 她比较适合喧闹的场所
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1181
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:56,180
她的语言或许需要再加强 但是...
Her language may need a little refining, but--

1182
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:59,880
真的，亨利 你应该了解这是不可能的任务
Really, Henry, if you cannot see how impossible this whole project is...

1183
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:01,850
你不该为她做愚蠢的事情
then you must be absolutely potty about her.

1184
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,290
我建议你放弃不要折磨你自己 或这可怜的女孩
l advise you to give it up and not put yourself... or this poor girl through any more.

1185
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,090
放弃 这是我最具挑战性的工作
Why, it's the most fascinating venture l've ever undertaken.

1186
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,430
平克林和我日夜不眠地投入 这充实了我们的生命
Pickering and l are at it from morning till night. lt fills our whole lives.

1187
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:15,330
教导伊莱莎，与伊莱莎对话 听伊莱莎说话，帮伊莱莎穿衣
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza, listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1188
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,700
什么？
What

1189
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:20,300
你像是个小孩在玩洋娃娃游戏
You're a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.

1190
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,600
车子来了
Here's the car.

1191
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,040
谢谢
Thank you , sir

1192
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:43,950
晚安，先生
Good evening, sir.

1193
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,620
晚餐好了没？我饿坏了 立刻就好，先生
-ls dinner ready? l'm famished. -lmmediately, sir.

1194
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:48,630
晚安，席根斯教授
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

1195
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:11,310
当她提到她姑姑如何喝东西时
When she mentioned How her aunt bit off the spoon

1196
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:15,380
她完全把我迷倒了
She completely done me in

1197
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:19,290
我的心飞到遥远的月球上了
And my heart went on A journey to the moon

1198
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:24,590
当她提到她父亲和琴酒时
When she told about her father And the gin

1199
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:29,400
我从未见过如此好笑的行为
And l never saw A more enchanting farce

1200
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:34,440
当她大声叫 “加速你的...”
Than the moment when she shouted ''Move your bloomin ''--

1201
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,940
什么事？ 杜立特尔小姐在吗？
-Yes, sir? -ls Miss Doolittle in?

1202
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:38,540
是谁来拜访？
Whom shall l say is calling?

1203
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:41,970
佛雷狄恩斯福特希尔 如果她不记得我
Freddy Eynsford-Hill. lf she doesn't remember who l am...

1204
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:45,010
就告诉她 我是看着她笑的年轻人
tell her l'm the chap who was sniggering at her.

1205
01:34:45,390 --> 01:34:46,350
是的
Yes, sir.

1206
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:48,720
可否将这个给她？ 好
And will you give her these?

1207
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,050
要进来吗？ 他们正在用餐，你在大厅等
Wouldn't you like to come in, sir? They're having dinner, but you may wait in the hall.

1208
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:55,460
不用了，谢谢 我在外面沉醉一下
No, thank you. l want to drink in the street where she lives.

1209
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:09,970
我以前常在这条路上漫步
l have often walked Down this street before

1210
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:15,640
但是脚下的步伐毫无特别
But the pavement always stayed Beneath my feet before

1211
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:21,250
瞬时间我的思绪飞扬在空中
All at once am l Several stories high

1212
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:27,160
知道这是你所住的街道
Knowing l'm on the street Where you live

1213
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:32,890
丁香花不是在市中心吗？
Are there lilac trees ln the heart of town?

1214
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,600
听到云雀在城市中鸣叫？
Can you hear a lark ln any other part of town?

1215
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:44,300
是否会迷倒所有的住户？
Does enchantment pour Out of every door?

1216
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:50,650
不，只是因你住在此
No, it's just on the street Where you live

1217
01:35:50,750 --> 01:36:02,290
知道你在附近 那感觉多么强烈
And, oh, the towering feeling Just to know Somehow you are near

1218
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:07,270
无法抗拒的情感
The overpowering feeling

1219
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:13,500
因为你随时都会出现
That any second You may suddenly appear

1220
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:19,340
我不在乎别人的注视
People stop and stare They don't bother me

1221
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:25,150
我只希望能够在此等你
For there's nowhere else on Earth That l would rather be

1222
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:33,060
让时光飞逝，我不在乎
Let the time go by l won't care if l

1223
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:40,160
我只要在你住的街道上等你
Can be here on the street Where you live

1224
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,500
先生
Sir

1225
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:47,040
非常抱歉，先生
l'm terribly sorry, sir.

1226
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:50,270
杜立特尔小姐说 她不再见到任何人了
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want to see anyone ever again.

1227
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,040
为何？她是如此惊艳动人
But why? She was unbelievable.

1228
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:55,310
我知道了，先生 还有什么话要转告？
So l've been told, sir. ls there any further message?

1229
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:57,780
有，告诉她我会等的
Tell her that l'll wait.

1230
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:00,250
哦，那有可能要好几天 甚至一个星期
Oh, but it might be days, sir, even weeks.

1231
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,790
你看不出来吗？ 我在这里很快乐
But don't you see? l'll be happier here.

1232
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:17,670
我不在乎别人的注视
People stop and stare They don't bother me

1233
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:23,640
我只希望能在此等你
For there's nowhere else on Earth That l would rather be

1234
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:32,380
让时光飞逝，我不在乎
Let the time go by l won't care if l

1235
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:43,230
我只要在你住的街道上等你
Can be here on the street Where you live

1236
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:50,400
席根斯，是真的 如此下去是很不人道的行为
lt really is, Higgins. lt's inhuman to continue.

1237
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:53,180
你知道这六周内 你要她做到什么吗？
Do you realize what you've got to try and teach this poor girl in six weeks?

1238
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:56,040
你要教她走路，说话，穿着 各种阶级的应对礼貌
You've got to teach her to walk, talk, address a duke, a lord...

1239
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,180
根本就是不可能的事
a bishop, an ambassador. lt's absolutely impossible.

1240
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,550
席根斯 我想要取消这次的打赌
Higgins, l'm trying to tell you that l want to call off the bet.

1241
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:04,880
我和你一样是很顽固的人
l know you're a stubborn man, but so am l.

1242
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:06,890
实验结束了
This experiment is over.

1243
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:12,980
连国王的命令也无法改变我意 失陪！
And nothing short of an order from the King could force me to recant.

1244
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:15,590
明白吗？ 席根斯，实验已结束了
You understand, Higgins? lt's over.

1245
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:20,230
席根斯，如果今晚 在大使馆发生任何差错
Higgins, if there's any mishap at the Embassy tonight...

1246
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,930
如果杜立特尔小姐 遭受任何侮辱
if Miss Doolittle suffers any embarrassment whatever...

1247
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,270
都将是你个人的责任
it'll be on your head alone.

1248
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:25,600
伊莱莎能办到的
Eliza can do anything.

1249
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:27,270
假如她被发现了呢？ 记得赛马场上的事情吗？
Suppose she's discovered? Remember Ascot.

1250
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:29,240
如果她忘了舞步 或是碰出几句粗话
Suppose she makes another ghastly mistake?

1251
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,140
舞会里没有马的，平克林
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1252
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,550
想到了就头大
Think of how agonizing it would be.

1253
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:39,280
万一今晚发生差错 不知道该如何是好
lf anything happened tonight, l don't know what l'd do.

1254
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,950
你还是可以回部队去
You could always rejoin your regiment.

1255
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:42,890
没时间开玩笑了，席根斯
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1256
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:47,220
在过去六周里 已超过那女孩所能承受的礼仪
The way you've driven her the last six weeks... has exceeded all bounds of common decency.

1257
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,260
拜托，别在那里踱步 可否坐下来？
For God's sake, stop pacing up and down. Can't you settle somewhere?

1258
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:52,300
喝点酒，可以让你不会紧张
Have some port. lt'll quieten your nerves.

1259
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,890
我并不紧张
l'm not nervous.

1260
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:57,300
酒在哪里？ 在钢琴上面
-Where is it? -On the piano.

1261
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:00,260
车子已经来了
The car's here, sir.

1262
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,170
好，告诉杜立特尔小姐 好吗？
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle, will you?

1263
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,610
真的要告诉杜立特尔小姐 我打赌她那件礼服根本不合身
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed. l'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1264
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:07,980
我警告过你不该找法国设计师
l warned you about these French designers.

1265
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:11,020
该找英国的 法国不跟我们同国
We should have gone to an English shop. They would've been on our side.

1266
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,210
喝一杯吗？ 不用，谢谢
-Have a glass of port? -No, thank you.

1267
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,300
你有确信她能够记住 你所教的一切吗？
Are you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?

1268
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:26,530
我们只有等着看了
Well, we shall see.

1269
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,200
如果她失败了呢？
Suppose she doesn't?

1270
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:31,160
这场打赌我就输了
l lose my bet.

1271
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:34,940
真受不了你那从容自负的态度
There's one thing l can't stand about you, that's your confounded complacency.

1272
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,870
尤其是在这紧要关头 又关系这么多的金额
At a moment like this, with so much at stake...

1273
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:39,970
你竟然还不需要喝一杯
it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of port.

1274
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:45,880
关于那女孩呢？ 你好像完全不在乎她
And what about the girl? You act as though she doesn't matter at all.

1275
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:48,780
胡说，平克林，她当然很重要
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1276
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,590
你以为我花心血是为了什么？
What do you think l've been doing all these months?

1277
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:54,860
有什么能比这更令人欣慰
What could possibly matter more than to take a human being...

1278
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:59,170
彻底改变一个人 让她能有新的谈吐方式
and change her into a different human being by creating a new speech for her?

1279
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:05,230
这完全消弭了阶级之间 灵魂之间的障碍
lt's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class... and soul from soul.

1280
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:09,170
哦，她对我而言很重要的
Oh, she matters immensely.

1281
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:32,760
杜立特尔小姐，你真漂亮
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1282
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,990
谢谢，平克林上校
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1283
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,660
你不觉得吗，席根斯？
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1284
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:42,570
非常好，真的非常好
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1285
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:52,340
“中场休息”

1286
01:41:57,490 --> 01:42:07,790
“间奏曲”

1287
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,250
大师！...
Maestro! Maestro!

1288
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:48,130
你不记得我了？
Don't you remember me?

1289
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:49,820
不记得，你是谁？
No. Who the devil are you?

1290
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:53,490
我是你最棒的第一位门生
l'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest, your best pupil.

1291
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,330
我是神童索腾卡帕锡
l'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1292
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:59,460
我让你名闻于全欧洲
l made your name famous throughout Europe.

1293
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,410
你教我语言学 你不可能忘记我的
You teach me phonetics. You cannot forget me.

1294
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:02,980
你为何不理个发？
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1295
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,170
我并没有像你一般的风采
l don't have your imposing appearance, your figure, your brow.

1296
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:09,150
如果我把头发剪短了 就没有人会注意到我
lf l had my hair cut, nobody would notice me.

1297
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:10,910
这些是你从哪儿弄来的？
Where did you get all of these old coins?

1298
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:13,010
是我对语言贡献得来的勋章
These are decorations for languages.

1299
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,020
今晚特兰夕法尼亚女王要来此
The Queen of Transylvania is here this evening.

1300
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,790
我是她在官方场合 不可或缺的要角
l'm indispensable to her at these official international parties.

1301
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:21,090
我精通32种语言 我认识欧洲的每一个人
l speak 32 languages. l know everyone in Europe.

1302
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,460
没有骗子可以逃过我的法眼
No imposter can escape my detection.

1303
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:26,130

The Greek ambassador.

1305
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,040
希腊，我的天啊！
Greek, my foot!

1306
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,700
他假装不会说英语 但是骗不了我的
He pretends not to know any English, but he cannot deceive me.

1307
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:36,000
他是约克夏钟表制造商的儿子
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1308
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:42,710
他的英语说得棒极了 无法掩饰他真实的身份
He speaks English so villainously that he cannot utter a word... without betraying his origin.

1309
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:46,280
我帮他假装 但他们都得付出代价
l help him pretend, but l make him pay through the nose. l make them all pay.

1310
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:49,520
打扰了，女王陛下要你上楼去
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs. Her Excellency asked for you.

1311
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:50,690

1327
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,610
哦，是我的远房亲戚 席根斯，失陪一下
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins. Excuse me.

1328

席根斯教授
Professor Higgins.

1329
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:26,550
一付不可捉摸的样子 好像她住在花园中
Such a faraway look, as if she's always lived in a garden.

1330
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:28,920
她是和花园有点关系
So she has. A sort of garden.

1331
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:01,260
亨利必须马上送伊莱莎回家 这里有位语言专家
Henry must take Eliza home at once. There's a language expert here.

1332
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,520
专门揭穿冒牌者的身份 你说什么？
-Sort of, you know, imposterologist. -l beg you pardon?

1333
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:07,320
那位和平克林上校一起的女孩
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

1334
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,520
查出她是谁

1335
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:10,930
我的荣幸
With pleasure.

1336
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,660
目前的场面一触即发
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1337
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:22,370
索腾，再告诉我一些 有关希腊大使的事
Tell me, Zoltan, some more about the Greek ambassador.

1338
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,000
很乐意，但请先介绍我 和那位优雅的女孩认识
Gladly, but first l would love you to present me to this glorious creature.

1339
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,950
他真的是从约克夏出身的吗？
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1340
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:40,180
特兰夕法尼亚女王陛下...
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

1341
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,460
和太子殿下葛戈
and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1342
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:32,070
迷人，真迷人
Charming. Quite charming.

1343
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:35,180
这位是杜立特尔小姐，女王
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1344
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,940
杜立特尔小姐 我的皇子想和你跳舞
Miss Doolittle, my son would like to dance with you.

1345

1346
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,830
真的是大功告成
Absolutely fantastic.

1347
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:27,740
一群傻瓜蛋
A lot of tomfoolery.

1348
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,830
没想到如此地成功
lt was an immense achievement.

1349
01:53:29,950 --> 01:53:31,210
怎样呢，席根斯先生？
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1350
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:35,010
胜利，皮尔斯太太 全面的胜利
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

1351
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:38,880
席根斯，你真是棒极了
Higgins, you were superb, absolutely superb.

1352
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:42,950
说实话 难道你真的都不紧张？
Tell us the truth now, weren't you a little bit nervous once or twice?

1353
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,790
整晚完全不紧张吗？
Not during the whole evening?

1354
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:46,550
直到我知道我赢了之后
Not when l saw we were going to win.

1355
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,420
我感觉像熊在笼子晃来晃去 无所事事
l felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

1356
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,400
没想到如此成功
lt was an immense achievement.

1357
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:53,130
如果我没自信 我两个月前就放弃了
lf l hadn't backed myself to do it, l'd have given it up two months ago.

1358
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:54,960
真的是大功告成
Absolutely fantastic.

1359
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:56,590
真的，一群傻瓜蛋
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1360
01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:58,640
席根斯，我向你致敬
Higgins, l salute you.

1361
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:01,470
那些傻瓜根本不知道 他们做了什么傻事
The silly people don't know their own silly business.

1362
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:04,640
今晚，老兄，你办到了...
Tonight, old man, you did it You did it, you did it

1363
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:07,610
你说你办得到，你真的办到了
You said that you would do it And indeed you did

1364
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:10,690
我以为你会懊恼 我怀疑你办得到
l thought that you would rue it l doubted you'd do it

1365
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:13,750
但是现在我必须承认你成功了
But now l must admit it That succeed you did

1366
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,580
你应得到勋章或加封进爵
You should get a medal Or be even made a knight

1367
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:19,420
哦，没什么大不了
Oh, it was nothing, really nothing

1368
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:22,960
你独自一人克服 迎面而来的障碍
All alone you hurdled Every obstacle in sight

1369
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:26,230
慢着...我不能独享这份荣耀
Now wait, now wait Give credit where it's due

1370
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:28,860
你也有很大的功劳
A lot of the glory goes to you

1371
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:32,560
但是你才是办到的人 你办到了...
But you're the one who did it Who did it, who did it

1372
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:37,010
是你坚毅不服输的精神
As sturdy as Gibraltar Not a second did you falter There's no doubt about it

1373
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:40,510
你办到了！
You did it!

1374
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:47,850
我得承认今晚我很紧张 以为自己会惊吓而死
l must have aged a year tonight At times l thought l'd die of fright

1375
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:50,650
没有放松过一分钟
Never was there a momentary lull

1376
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:55,850
当我们一进去 我立刻知道成功在握
Shortly after we came in l saw at once we'd easily win

1377
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:58,690
在那之后，我更确定赢了
And after that l found it deadly dull

1378
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,200
你们真该在场听那些惊叹声
You should have heard The ''oohs ''and ''aahs ''

1379
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:04,290
每个人都在猜她是谁
Everyone wondering who she was

1380
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:07,770
他们好像从没见过女人
You'd think they'd never seen A lady before

1381
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:13,140
当王子要求见她时
And when the Prince of Transylvania Asked to meet her

1382
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:17,280
伸出手腕带她进舞池
And gave his arm To lead her to the floor

1383
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,380
我就告诉他，你办到了...
l said to him.: ''You did it You did it, you did it''

1384
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:24,620
他们认为她气质非凡 举止高贵
They thought she was ecstatic And so damned aristocratic

1385
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:30,430
没人想到这完全是你的杰作
And they never knew That you did it

1386
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:34,500
真是感谢索腾卡帕锡
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1387
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,800
如果不是有他 我还真的很无聊呢
lf it hadn't been for him l would've died of boredom.

1388
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:39,170
卡帕锡？那可怕的匈牙利人 他在那里？
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian? Was he there?

1389
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:42,140
对，他在那里耍他的老把戏
Yes, he was there all right and up to his old tricks.

1390
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:47,380
那无赖利用语言科学 专门来敲诈行骗别人
That blackguard Who uses the science of speech More to blackmail and swindle than teach

1391
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:54,020
他想用他的专业 来查出杜立特尔小姐是谁
He made it the devilish business of his To find out who this Miss Doolittle is

1392
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:59,790
只要我们一转身 他像猎犬般地在身边
Every time we looked around There he was That hairy hound from Budapest

1393
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:06,170
根本就不放过我们，真烦人
Never leaving us alone Never have l ever known A ruder pest

1394
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,510
后来认为不让他有机会接近她 这岂不是太傻了
Finally l decided it was foolish Not to let him have his chance with her

1395
01:56:14,410 --> 01:56:18,400
所以我就退一边 让他和她来共舞
So l stepped aside And let him dance with her

1396
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:25,550
他就尽力使出全身的魅力
Oozing charm from every pore He oiled his way around the floor

1397
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:29,990
用尽方法 只想拆穿她的真面目
Every trick that he could play He used to strip her mask away

1398
01:56:30,430 --> 01:56:34,520
音乐结束 他很得意以为自己赢了
And when at last the dance was done He glowed as if he knew he'd won

1399
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:38,460
满脸微笑迫不及待想开口
And with a voice too eager And a smile too broad

1400
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:42,630
她告诉宴会女主人 她是个冒牌货
He announced to the hostess That she was a fraud

1401
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,670
不！
No!

1402
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:54,340
她的英语太标准 那就表示她是外国人
''Her English is too good, ''he said ''That clearly indicates that she is foreign

1403
01:56:56,620 --> 01:57:01,280
有人曾说英国本地人 不可能讲那种标准的英语
''Whereas others are instructed ln their native language ''English people aren't

1404
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,620
虽然她可以向语言专家学英语
''And although she may have studied with An expert dialectician and grammarian

1405
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:14,790
但我还是可以探出 她的真实身份
''l can tell that she was born

1406
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:16,870
她是匈牙利人
''Hungarian ''

1407
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:21,440
不只是匈牙利人还有贵族血统
Not only Hungarian but of royal blood

1408
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:24,300
她是一位公主
She is a princess

1409
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:28,480
他说她的血统比多瑙河还清
''Her blood, ''he said ''ls bluer than the Danube is or ever was

1410
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:31,550
脸上充满了贵族气质
''Royalty is absolutely written on her face

1411
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:34,750
她以为骗得了我但其实不然
''She thought l was taken in But actually l never was

1412
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:37,690
她怎认为可以骗得了自己同胞
''How could she deceive Another member of her race?

1413
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:42,890
他说我知道全世界各国语言
''l know each language on the map'' Said he

1414
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,300
她是不折不扣的匈牙利公主
''And she's Hungarian As the first Hungarian Rhapsody''

1415
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:54,770
太精彩了

1416
01:57:55,310 --> 01:57:59,140
恭喜，席根斯教授
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1417
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:03,010
祝贺你光荣的胜利
For your glorious victory

1418
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:07,050
恭喜，席根斯教授
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1419
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:10,910
你将会名留青史
You'll be mentioned in history

1420
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:31,340
恭喜，席根斯教授 祝贺你光荣的胜利
Congratulations, Professor HigginsFor your glorious victory

1421
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:35,810
感谢上帝，一切都结束了
Well, thank God, that's over.

1422
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:38,820
我终于可以安眠了
Now l can go to bed without dreading tomorrow.

1423
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,790
晚安，席根斯先生 晚安，皮尔斯太太
-Good night, Mr. Higgins. -Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

1424
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:47,760
我也想睡了，晚安，席根斯 真是难忘的一夜
l think l'll turn in, too. Good night, Higgins. lt's been a great occasion.

1425
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,300
晚安，平克林
Good night, Pickering.

1426
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,870
皮尔斯太太？
Mrs. Pearce?

1427
01:58:52,670 --> 01:58:56,870
该死 我要她明早送咖啡不要茶
Damn, l meant to ask her to give me coffee in the morning instead of tea.

1428
01:58:57,510 --> 01:59:00,910
伊莱沙，你留条子给她好吗？ 把灯关掉
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza. And put out the lights.

1429
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:51,680
是不是在楼下，哦，真是的
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.

1430
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:53,860
我这些天都没在用脑子
l'll leave my head behind one of these days.

1431
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:56,160
我到底把拖鞋放哪去了？
What the devil have l done with my slippers?

1432
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:00,930
这是你的拖鞋！
Here are your slippers!

1433
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:06,200
拿去
Take

1434
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:10,210
拿去你的拖鞋 希望你穿上后失去好运
Take your slippers and may you never have a day's luck with them.

1435
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:14,580
怎么回事？哪里不对劲？
What on Earth? What's the matter? ls anything wrong?

1436
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:17,650
没什么，你是没什么 我帮你赢了打赌，不是吗？
No, nothing's wrong with you. l won your bet for you, haven't l?

1437
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:20,590
对你而言是有成就 我根本不重要吧？
That's enough for you! l don't matter, l suppose?

1438
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:24,820
你帮我赢的？有没有弄错？ 是我自己赢的
You won my bet? You presumptuous insect! l won it!

1439
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,550
你为何用拖鞋丢我？
Why did you throw those slippers at me?

1440
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:29,930
因为我想丢到你的脸上 杀死你这自私的家伙！
Because l wanted to smash your face. l could kill you, you selfish brute!

1441
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:32,360
你当初为何不让我 留在贫民窟？
Why didn't you leave me where you picked me up, the gutter?

1442
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:36,130
你感谢上帝一切都结束了 你现在就要送我回那里去吧？
You thank God it's all over. Now you can throw me back again! Do you?

1443
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:38,930
哦，原来你已经开始在紧张了
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1444
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:44,740
收回你的猫爪 你竟敢如此对我？
Claws in, you cat! How dare you show your temper to me?

1445
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:46,400
安静地坐下！
Sit down and be quiet!

1446
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:50,210
哦，我会变成如何？...
Oh, what's to become of me? What's to become of me?

1447
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,550
我怎么会知道你会变得如何？ 那和我没关系
How the devil do l know what's to become of you? What does it matter?

1448
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,490
你根本不在乎 我知道你根本不在乎我
You don't care. l know you don't care.

1449
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,850
你根本不管我的死活 我跟你毫无瓜葛
You wouldn't care if l was dead. l'm nothing to you.

1450
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,830
比拖鞋还不如
Not as much as them slippers.

1451
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:03,990
这些拖鞋！
Those slippers!

1452
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:07,760
这些拖鞋 我想现在根本没什么不同了
Those slippers! l didn't think it meant any difference now.

1453
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:13,570
你为何突然有如此的举动？
Why have you suddenly begun going on like this?

1454
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,730
请教一下，你是否对这里 任何有不满之处？
May l ask if you complain of your treatment here?

1455
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:17,740
没有
No

1456
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:21,110
有人对你不好吗？ 平克林上校还是皮尔斯太太？
Has anybody behaved badly? Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1457
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:22,480
没有
No

1458
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:26,140
你不会说是我对你不好吧？
Well you don't pretend that l have treated you badly?

1459
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:27,350
不是
No

1460
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:29,450
这样就好
Well, l'm glad to hear that.

1461
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,690
或许因为这几天训练的太累了
Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.

1462
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:36,720
你要吃巧克力吗？
Would you have a chocolate?

1463
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:39,770
不了，谢谢
No, thank you.

1464
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:44,890
其实你应该高兴才对 都结束了
Well, it's only natural that you should be anxious, but it's all over now.

1465
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,170
你没什么好担心了
Nothing more to worry about.

1466
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:50,280
不，是你不必再担心什么了
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

1467
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:54,480
哦，天啊 我真希望我死掉算了
Oh, God, l wish l was dead.

1468
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:57,510
为什么？到底是为了什么？
Why? ln heaven's name, why?

1469
02:01:58,390 --> 02:02:02,020
听我说，伊莱莎 所有的烦躁都是个人因素
Now listen to me, Eliza. All this irritation is purely subjective.

1470
02:02:02,490 --> 02:02:04,720
我不了解，我太无知了
l don't understand. l'm too ignorant.

1471
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:08,060
那只是幻想，并没有什么不对 没有人会伤害你的
lt's just imagination. Nothing's wrong. Nobody's hurting you.

1472
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:14,170
你上床睡觉，好好哭一场 向上帝祷告，你会感觉好些的
Go to bed and sleep it off. Have a little cry and say your prayers. You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1473
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:18,270
我听到你的祷告了 感谢上帝，一切都结束
l heard your prayers. ''Thank God it's all over.''

1474
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:20,070
难道你不感谢上帝 这一切都结束了吗？
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1475
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:22,570
你现在自由了 可以做你想做的任何事情
Now you're free, and you can do what you like.

1476
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,980
哦，我适合做什么？ 你让我以后能做什么呢？
Oh, what am l fit for? What have you left me fit for?

1477
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:29,380
我要何去何从？ 我会变成怎样呢？
Where am l to go? What am l to do?

1478
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:32,110
我会变成怎样呢？
And what's to become of me?

1479
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:36,060
哦，原来你是为此事烦恼
Oh, that's what's worrying you, is it?

1480
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:39,460
如果我是你 我才不会担心这个呢
l wouldn't worry about that if l were you.

1481
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:43,720
我相信你要找栖身之所 应该不会很困难的
l'm sure you won't have any difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1482
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:48,900
我没想到你终究还是会离开的
l didn't quite realize you were going away.

1483
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:52,370
你有可能会结婚
You might marry, you know.

1484
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:56,640
伊莱莎，并非每个男人 都像我和上校一样抱独身主义
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1485
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:59,770
大部分的男人都会想结婚 可怜的家伙
Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils.

1486
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:04,250
你长的还不错 事实上你还真的很美
You're not bad-looking. You're really quite a pleasure to look at sometimes.

1487
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:07,620
当然不是现在，因为你哭了 你就像母夜叉一样，但是...
Not now, when you've been crying. You look like the very devil, but...

1488
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:13,090
在平常的时候 你是相当吸引人的
when you're all right and quite yourself you're what l would call attractive.

1489
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:16,390
你现去睡觉，好好地休息 早上起来之后...
Go to bed, have a good night's rest, get up in the morning...

1490
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:19,730
看看镜中的自己 你就会感觉好一点了
and have a look at yourself in the glass. You won't feel so bad.

1491
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:28,330
也许我母亲 可以找到不错的年青人
l daresay, my mother might find some fellow or other who would do very well.

1492
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:30,770
我们已经超越层级了
We were above that in Covent Garden.

1493
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,350
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

1494
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:35,070
我卖花，但我不卖身
l sold flowers, l didn't sell myself.

1495
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:38,940
现在你把我变成淑女 我什么都不能卖了
Now you've made a lady of me, l'm not fit to sell anything else.

1496
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:41,680
哦，胡说，伊莱莎 不要看扁人们的关系
Oh, tosh, Eliza. Don't insult human relations...

1497
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:44,820
只会存在买卖的关系
by dragging all that cant about buying and selling into it.

1498
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:46,990
你不喜欢他，你不必嫁给他
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1499
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:48,690
那我又能做些什么呢？
What else am l to do?

1500
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:53,130
哦，很多事情 你以前想要开花店的啊
Oh, there are lots of things. What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1501
02:03:53,230 --> 02:03:56,260
我相信平克林可以帮你的忙 他很有钱
l'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one. He's got lots of money.

1502
02:03:56,370 --> 02:04:02,500
今晚你穿戴的所有饰物 价值二百英镑都是他付的
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing. And that with the hire of the jewelry'll make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1503
02:04:02,710 --> 02:04:05,010
哦，拜托，你不会有事的
Oh, come on now. You'll be all right.

1504
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:09,150
我必须去睡了 我真的太想睡了
Well, l must be off to bed. l'm really devilish sleepy.

1505
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,950
我不是在找东西吗？是什么？
l was looking for something. What was it?

1506
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:14,310
你的拖鞋
Your slippers.

1507
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:17,590
哦，对了，你用它打我
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1508
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:21,190
在你离开之前，先生
Before you go, sir.

1509
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:27,760
我身上的衣服是属于我 还是平克林上校？
Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?

1510
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:31,030
怎么会是平克林上校的呢？
What the devil use would they be to Pickering?

1511
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:32,940
你干嘛在三更半夜问这些？
Why bother about that in the middle of the night?

1512
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,670
我要知道我能带走些什么？
What may l take away with me?

1513
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:36,900
我不想被指控偷窃
l don't want to be accused of stealing.

1514
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:39,110
偷窃？
Stealing?

1515
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:42,920
你不该这样说的 那显示占有的欲望
You shouldn't have said that. That shows a want of feeling.

1516
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:45,480
抱歉 我只是个普通无知的村妇
l'm sorry. l'm only a common,

1517
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:47,490
我这种身份必须很小心
ignorant girl and in my station l have to be careful.

1518
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:50,790
我们之间该不会 出现喜欢彼此的情感
There can't be any feelings between the likes of you and the likes of me.

1519
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:53,880
所以请告诉我，什么是我的 而那些不是？
Please, will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1520
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,460
如果你喜欢房子里 所有的东西都拿走
Take the whole damned houseful if you want.

1521
02:04:57,700 --> 02:05:00,030
除了那宝石是租来的以外 你满意了吗？
Except the jewelry. That's hired. Will that satisfy you?

1522
02:05:00,130 --> 02:05:01,260
请等一下
Stop, please.

1523
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:06,600
请把它带走，放在安全的地方
Will you take these to your room and keep them safe?

1524
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:10,270
我不想要冒它们被偷的险
l don't want to run the risk of them being missed.

1525
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:15,670
哦，拿给我吧！ 如果这些是我的又不是宝石...
Oh, hand them over! lf these belonged to me and not the jeweler, l'd...

1526
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,340
我会用它塞入 你那不知感恩的喉咙里
l'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.

1527
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:22,920
这戒指不是租的 是你在布莱顿买给我的
The ring isn't the jeweler's. lt's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1528
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,620
我现在不想要了
l don't want it now.

1529
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:30,560
别打我！
Don't you hit me!

1530
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:34,200
打你？你这个可恶的人 你竟敢这样说！
Hit you? You infamous creature! How dare you suggest such a thing!

1531
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:36,930
是你要打我的 你存心要伤害我的
lt's you who've hit me. You've wounded me to the heart.

1532
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:40,630
我真高兴我还保有我的心
l'm glad. l've got a little of my own back anyhow.

1533
02:05:42,010 --> 02:05:45,380
你令我生气 以前很少会发生这种事
You've caused me to lose my temper. That's hardly happened to me before.

1534
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:48,240
今晚我不想讨论了，我要睡了
l don't wish to discuss it further tonight. l'm going to bed.

1535
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:50,720
你最好自己留条子 给皮尔斯太太有关咖啡的事...
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee...

1536
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,580
我是不会帮你写的
for it won't be done by me!

1537
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:56,280
去他的皮尔斯太太 去他的咖啡还有去你的！
Damn Mrs. Pearce, damn the coffee and damn you!

1538
02:05:57,530 --> 02:06:05,230
去我自己还慷慨用我的知识 帮助一位无情无义的流浪儿
Damn my own folly for having lavished my hard-earned knowledge... and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1539
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:01,020
等着看，席根斯，等着看
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait!

1540
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:07,120
你会后悔 但你流泪也来不及了
You'll be sorry But your tears will be too late

1541
02:07:09,130 --> 02:07:16,130
你将会失败而无人可哭诉
You will be the one it's done to And you'll have no one to run to

1542
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:18,230
等着看
Just you wait

1543
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:52,430
我以前常在这条路上漫步
l have often walked Down this street before

1544
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:58,340
但是脚下的步伐毫无特别
But the pavement always stayed Beneath my feet before

1545
02:07:58,450 --> 02:08:04,110
瞬时间我的思绪飞扬在空中
All at once am l Several stories high

1546
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:10,050
知道这是你所住的街道
Knowing l'm on the street Where you live

1547
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:15,960
丁香花不是在市中心吗？
Are there lilac trees ln the heart of town?

1548
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:21,900
听到云雀在城市中鸣叫？
Can you hear a lark ln any other part of town?

1549
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,770
是否会迷倒所有的住户？
Does enchantment pour Out of every door?

1550
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:33,750
不，只是因你住在此
No, it's just On the street where you live

1551
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:45,920
知道你在附近 那感觉多么强烈
And, oh, the towering feeling Just to know Somehow you are near

1552
02:08:46,030 --> 02:08:51,120
无法抗拒的情感
The overpowering feeling

1553
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:57,330
因为你随时都会出现
That any second You may suddenly appear

1554
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:02,030
我不在乎别人的注视
People stop and stare They don't--

1555
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,450
亲爱的
Darling.

1556
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,650
佛雷狄，你在这里干什么？
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1557
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:15,620
没事，我大部分的晚上都在此 因为我来这里会很快乐
Nothing. l spend most of my nights here. lt's the only place where l'm happy.

1558
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,320
不要取笑我，杜立特尔小姐
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1559
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:21,360
别叫我杜立特尔小姐，听到没 叫我伊莱莎就好
Don't you call me ''Miss Doolittle,'' do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

1560
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:26,960
哦，佛雷狄，你认为我是个 无情无义的流浪儿吗？
Oh, Freddy, you don't think l'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1561
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:30,430
亲爱的，你怎会如此讲呢？ 你知道我对你的感受
Darling, how could you imagine such a thing? You know how l feel.

1562
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:33,970
我一天写好几次的信告诉你 一张接一张
l've written two and three times a day telling you. Sheets and sheets.

1563
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:37,530
你一开口，声音如同歌唱一般
Speak And the world is full of singing

1564
02:09:37,650 --> 02:09:42,880
我心也飞上天空 比鸟飞的还高
And l am winging Higher than the birds

1565
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:46,780
你一摸，我的心就崩溃
Touch And my heart begins to crumble

1566
02:09:46,890 --> 02:09:50,720
天也塌了，亲爱的，我...
The heavens tumble Darling, and l'm--

1567
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:53,950
文字...我痛恨文字
Words, words, words l'm so sick of words

1568
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:57,220
我每天都听文字 先是他，现在是你
l get words all day through First from him, now from you

1569
02:09:57,330 --> 02:10:01,230
你们这些浑蛋只会用说的吗？
ls that all you blighters can do?

1570
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:05,270
别谈星光在天空闪耀
Don't talk of stars burning above

1571
02:10:05,370 --> 02:10:08,570
如果你要恋爱，表现给我看
lf you're in love, show me

1572
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:11,840
别光说梦中充满欲望

如果你欲火焚身，表现给我看

1574

我们现在三更半夜在一起

1575
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:21,810
别说春天，紧抱着我吧

Anyone who's ever been in love'll Tell you that

1577
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:26,830
现在不是聊天的时机
This is no time for a chat

1578
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,830
难道你不曾想要亲吻我吗？

02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:57,480
你可以直接告诉他 我真的很惨
Well, l'm miserable, all right. You can tell him that straight.

1645
02:15:57,590 --> 02:16:00,120
你在说什么？ 干什么如此打扮？
What are you talking about? What are you dressed up for?

1646
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:01,760
假装你好像不知道
As if you didn't know.

1647
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:05,700
回到温普街恶魔的身边 告诉他对我做的好事
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil. Tell him what he's done to me.

1648
02:16:06,070 --> 02:16:07,560
他对你做了什么？
What's he done to you?

1649
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:09,360
把我彻底的毁了！
Ruined me, that's all.

1650
02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:13,170
让我被中产阶级的道德所束缚
Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle-class morality.

1651
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:15,070
你休想替他辩护
And don't you defend him.

1652
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:19,340
他写信给一个讨厌的 美国百万富翁以斯拉
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old American blighter named Wallingford...

1653
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:24,150
那个人拿出五百万基金 成立道德改革会
who was giving five millions to found Moral Reform societies...

1654
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:28,820
告诉他说亚尔杜立特尔 是英国最好的道德家
to tell him the most original moralist in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1655
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,590
一位普通的清洁工？
a common dustman?

1656
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:33,750
听起来好像是他开的一个玩笑
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1657
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:37,200
你说是玩笑，我却惨了，真的
You may call it a joke. lt's put the lid on me. Proper.

1658
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:42,060
老家伙死了还立遗嘱说 每年要给我四千英镑
The old bloke died and left me 4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1659
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:47,600
谁请他把我变成为绅士？ 我很快乐，我很自由
Who asked him to make a gentleman outta me? l was 'appy. l was free.

1660
02:16:48,210 --> 02:16:52,140
我没有钱时 我晚上可以找人要
l touched pretty nigh everyone for money when l wanted it, same as l touched him.

1661
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:56,110
现在我穿戴整齐 换成别人来找我
Now l'm tied neck and 'eels and everybody touches me.

1662
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:59,720
一年前我跟这世界毫无瓜葛
A year ago l 'adn't a relation in the world...

1663
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:02,480
除了一两个不太搭理我的人
except one or two who wouldn't speak to me.

1664
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:06,120
现在我有五十个亲戚 每个星期固定资助他们
Now l've 50. Not a decent week's wages amongst the 'ot of them.

1665
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:11,520
哦，我现在要为旁人而活 并非为自己了，中产阶级道德
Oh, l have to live for others now, not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1666
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:15,530
快点，亚尔 再几小时就得去教堂了
Come on, Alfie, in a couple of hours we have to be at the church.

1667
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:18,000
教堂？ 对，去教堂
-Church? -Yeah, church.

1668
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:20,770
最严重的后果
The deepest cut of all.

1669
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:24,300
你以为我穿戴整齐 像出殡一样要干嘛？
Why do you think l'm dressed up like a ruddy pallbearer?

1670
02:17:25,050 --> 02:17:26,880
你的继母要嫁给我了
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1671
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:30,040
我现在受人尊敬 她想要和我一样受人尊敬
Now l'm respectable, she wants to be respectable.

1672
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:33,520
如果你不爽？ 为何不把钱还给他呢？
lf that's the way you feel about it, why don't you give the money back?

1673
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:35,550
这就是最悲哀的一点，伊莱莎
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1674
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:40,290
说的容易，但我却没那胆量
lt's easy to say chuck it... but l 'aven't the nerve.

1675
02:17:40,830 --> 02:17:43,460
我们以前每天朝不保夕
We're all intimidated. That's what we are, intimidated.

1676
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:46,230
现在我觉得我自己被收买了
Bought up. Yeah. That's what l am.

1677
02:17:46,970 --> 02:17:49,490
这都要怪你珍爱的教授所赐予
That's what your precious professor's brought me to.

1678
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:51,700
他不是我珍爱的教授
Not my precious professor.

1679
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:54,340
哦，他把你送回来了？
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1680
02:17:56,010 --> 02:18:01,450
他先把我推进中产阶级 然后又把你送回来让我养
First he shoves me in the middle-class, then he chucks you out for me to support.

1681
02:18:01,550 --> 02:18:03,380
这都是他计划的一部分
That's all part of his plan...

1682
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:05,910
但是你出卖他了
but you double-cross him.

1683
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:10,850
别想回家找我 我一毛钱都不会给你
Don't you come back home to me. Don't you take tuppence from me.

1684
02:18:11,460 --> 02:18:14,660
你现在是淑女了 可以自力更生了
You stand on your own two feet. You're a lady now, you can do it.

1685
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:18,260
对，没错，伊莱莎 你现在是淑女了
Yeah, that's right, Eliza. You're a lady now.

1686
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:20,760
伊莱莎，计程车等很久了
Eliza, it's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1687
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:24,670
伊莱莎 你想要来看我的结婚典礼吗？
Here, Eliza, would you like to come and see me turned off this morning? Eh?

1688
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:27,700
十点在汉诺威广场的 圣乔治教堂
St. George's, Hanover Square, ten o'clock.

1689
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:29,800
我不勉强你 但是你随时都可以来
l wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

1690
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:31,280
不了，谢谢，父亲
No, thank you, Dad.

1691
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:34,340
你的事情都办完了吗 伊莱莎？
Are you all finished here, Eliza?

1692
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:38,340
是的，佛雷狄，办完了
Yes, Freddy, l'm all finished here.

1693
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:43,450
祝好运，爸爸
Good luck, Dad.

1694

1695
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:04,130
来吧，亚尔
Come along, Alfie.

1696
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:06,010
我还剩多少时间？
How much time have l got left?

1697
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:11,580
你只剩几个钟头了
There's just a few more hours That's all the time you've got

1698
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:16,690
只剩几个钟头，就要结为连理
A few more hours Before they tie the knot

1699
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:20,590
在伦敦有那么多的酒和女人
There's drinks and girls All over London

1700
02:19:20,990 --> 02:19:24,760
我只剩几小时把他们全找到

l told you, sir, she took them all with her.

1770
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:15,150
平克林，发生了奇怪的事 伊莱莎，跑走了 跑走？ 跑走了
Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted. Bolted!

1771
02:25:15,250 --> 02:25:18,550
昨晚皮尔斯太太让她走了 竟然完全没有告诉我
Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go without telling me a thing about it!

1772
02:25:18,650 --> 02:25:20,740
我怎么办？ 我早上要喝茶不喝咖啡
What am l to do? l got tea this morning instead of coffee.

1773
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:22,650
我不知东西放在那 我有哪些会议要参加
l don't know where anything is, what my appointments are.

1774
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:25,690
伊莱莎知道 该死，她走了啊！
-Eliza'd know. -Damn it, she's gone!

1775
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:28,020
你们两位是否 昨晚把她吓着了？
Did either of you gentlemen frighten her last night?

1776
02:25:28,130 --> 02:25:30,120
我们根本没有跟她说话 你也在场
We hardly said a word to her. You were there.

1777
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:31,820
我去睡觉后你又凶她了吗？
Did you bully her after l went to bed?

1778
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:33,690
相反地，她用拖鞋丢我
She threw the slippers at me.

1779
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:38,100
我根本没有惹她 我还没说话拖鞋就打到我的头
l never gave her the slightest provocation. The slippers came bang at my head before l uttered a word.

1780
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:42,230
她用最恶毒的话骂我 我吓一跳，我完全不懂
She used the most disgraceful language. l was shocked! l don't understand it.

1781
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:44,810
我们对她照顾周详 她自己也承认
We always gave her every consideration. She admitted it.

1782
02:25:44,910 --> 02:25:45,740
我毫无概念！
l'm dashed!

1783
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:49,340
哦，平克林，快想些办法啊 什么办法？
Oh, Pickering, for God's sake, stop being dashed and do something!

1784
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,080
打电话报警啊，不都是这样吗
Phone the police. What are they there for in heaven's name?

1785
02:25:52,190 --> 02:25:54,680
席根斯 不能把伊莱莎的名字告诉警察
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

1786
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:56,880
好像她是小偷或偷了东西似的
as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

1787
02:25:56,990 --> 02:26:01,260
为何不行？我要找到那女孩 她是我的，我付了5英镑
But why not? l want to find the girl. She belongs to me. l paid five pounds for her.

1788
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:04,620
没错，请帮我接苏格兰警场
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1789
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:06,960
给我杯咖啡，好吗？ 是的
Get me some coffee, would you please?

1790
02:26:07,070 --> 02:26:09,300
苏格兰警场
Scotland Yard?

1791
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:17,780
对不起，我是平克林上校 住温普街27号A
l beg your pardon, yes. This is, this is Colonel Pickering speaking. 27 A Wimpole Street.

1792
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:20,510
我要报案，是人口失踪
l want to report a missing person.

1793
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:24,380
伊莱莎杜立特尔小姐
Miss Eliza Doolittle.

1794
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:25,450
年约21岁
About 21 .

1795
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:29,520
哦，身高我想是五尺七英寸
Oh, l should say about 5 foot 7.

1796
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:34,720
眼睛的颜色？ 让我想想，眼睛...
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes. Her eyes--

1797
02:26:35,060 --> 02:26:36,820
褐色 褐色
-Brown. -Brown.

1798
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:44,260
头发颜色？哦，天啊 很难区分...
Her hair? Oh, good Lord. Well, sort of nondescript neutral sort of--

1799
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:46,000
褐色...！
Brown, brown, brown!

1800
02:26:46,110 --> 02:26:48,570
你你听到了吗？褐色...是的
You heard what he said? Brown, brown, brown, yes.

1801
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,310
不...这里是...
No, no, no. This is her residence. 27 A--

1802
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:55,240
是，大约是今天凌晨 三点至四点间
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00 this morning, l understand.

1803
02:26:56,420 --> 02:27:00,350
不...她不是亲戚，不是，什么
No, no, no.... No, she's no relation, no.

1804
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:03,250
她就是我们很好的朋友
Well, just let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1805
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:05,120
你说什么？
l beg your pardon?

1806
02:27:05,430 --> 02:27:08,160
听着，我不喜欢你问的问题
Listen to me, my man, l don't like the tenor of that question.

1807
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:10,820
她在此干嘛是我们的私事
What the girl does here is our affair.

1808
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:15,420
你们的职责就是尽快找到她
Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it.

1809
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,530
我真的昏头了
Well, l'm dashed!

1810
02:27:20,070 --> 02:27:23,040
真不知道她为何要走？
What in all, in heaven Could have prompted her to go?

1811
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:25,240
在舞会表现成功之后
After such a triumph at the ball

1812
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,670
何事让她沮丧？
What could have depressed her?

1813
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:31,380
她执着些什么？ 我真的毫无头绪
What could have possessed her? l cannot understand the wretch at all

1814
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:37,950
席根斯，我在内政部有朋友 或许他能帮忙
Higgins, l have an old school chum at the Home Office. Perhaps he could help.

1815
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:39,610
我该打个电话给他
Think l'll give him a ring.

1816
02:27:41,530 --> 02:27:44,290
请接白厅7244号
Whitehall: 7244, please.

1817
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:49,420
女人根本毫无理性可言
Women are irrational That's all there is to that

1818
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:51,900
脑袋装的是浆糊
Their heads are full of Cotton, hay and rags

1819
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:56,470
女人是令人恼怒，令人生气 犹豫不决，工于心计
They're nothing but exasperating lrritating, vacillating, calculating

1820
02:27:56,580 --> 02:27:59,310
激动，疯狂，易怒的臭婆娘
Agitating, maddening And infuriating hags

1821
02:28:00,850 --> 02:28:04,180
我想和布鲁斯特巴金先生说话
l want to speak to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

1822
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:06,420
好的，我会等的
Yes, l'll wait.

1823
02:28:11,790 --> 02:28:16,160
平克林 为何女人不能像男人一般？
Pickering, why can't a woman be more like a man?

1824
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:17,820
你说什么？
l beg your pardon?

1825
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:21,730
是啊 为何女人不能像男人一般？
Yes, why can't a woman be more like a man?

1826
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:29,100
男人诚实，公正，高贵，公平
Men are so honest, so thoroughly square Eternally noble, historically fair

1827
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:32,370
是谁在赢得胜利 会鼓励手下败将？
Who, when you win Will always give your back a pat?

1828
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:35,710
为何女人不能像那样呢？
Why can't a woman be like that?

1829
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:39,620
为何都要相互模仿？
Why does every one do What the others do?

1830
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:42,980
难道女人没有大脑？
Can't a woman learn to use her head?

1831
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:45,990
为何她们都照母亲的指示做？
Why do they do everything Their mothers do?

1832
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:49,490
为何她们长大不能像父亲？
Why don't they grow up Well, like their father instead?

1833
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,660
为何女人不能向男人学习？
Why can't a woman take after a man?

1834
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:55,960
男人很和o，容易取悦
Men are so pleasant, so easy to please

1835
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:59,300
当你跟他们一起，都很轻松
Whenever you're with them You're always at ease

1836
02:28:59,410 --> 02:29:01,810
如果我一下子没跟你说话 你会觉得受轻视吗？
Would you be slighted lf l didn't speak for hours?

1837
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:02,740
当然不会

1838
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:04,810
如果我喝一两杯 你会发怒吗？
Would you be livid lf l had a drink or two?

1839
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:05,900
别胡扯

1840
02:29:06,010 --> 02:29:08,280
如果我没送你花 你会不会心碎？
Would you be wounded lf l never sent you flowers?

1841
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:09,040
不会吧！

1842
02:29:09,150 --> 02:29:12,350
为何女人不能像你一般？
Well, why can't a woman be like you?

1843
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:15,920
或许百万人中会有一人不同
One man in a million may shout a bit

1844
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:19,250
多多少少会有一个瑕疵
Now and then There's one with slight defects

1845
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:22,390
或许有一人的真诚值得你怀疑
One perhaps whose truthfulness You doubt a bit

1846
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:26,450
但是大多数而言 我们是优秀的男人
But by and large We are a marvelous sex

1847
02:29:26,570 --> 02:29:29,560
为何女人不能向男人学习？
Why can't a woman take after a man?

1848
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:32,830
因为男人是友善的 有善良的性质，善解人意
Cause men are so friendly Good-natured and kind

1849
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:36,270
找不到这么好的朋友
A better companion You never will find

1850
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:38,870
如果我迟点回家吃晚饭 你会对我咆哮吗？
lf l were hours late for dinner Would you bellow?

1851
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:39,710
当然不会

1852
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:41,800
如果我忘记你的生日 你会大惊小怪吗？
lf l forgot your silly birthday Would you fuss?

1853
02:29:41,910 --> 02:29:42,740
别胡扯

1854
02:29:42,850 --> 02:29:45,040
如果我跟另外一个人出去 你会抱怨吗？
Would you complain lf l took out another fellow?

1855
02:29:45,150 --> 02:29:45,950
不会！

1856
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:49,390
为何女人不能像我们一般
Well, why can't a woman be like us?

1857
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:53,720
布鲁斯特巴金先生在吗？
ls Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

1858
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:59,330
布鲁斯，哦，布鲁斯 你绝对猜不着我是谁
Bruzzie. Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is.

1859
02:30:00,570 --> 02:30:04,300
没错，天啊，你的记性真好
You're quite right, it is. Good heavens. By George, what a memory.

1860
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:08,410
你好吗，布鲁斯？ 真高兴听到你的声音
How are you, Bruzzie? Nice to hear your voice.

1861
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:12,140
什么？真的吗 30年没见了，布鲁斯？
What? You don't say. Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?

1862
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:14,170
没错，相隔太远了
Quite right. Yes, oceans of water.

1863
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:16,540
听着，布鲁斯 有件事要拜托你
Listen, Bruzzie, l'll tell you why l rang up.

1864
02:30:16,650 --> 02:30:20,380
有件不太好的事发生 我可否去找你？
Something rather unpleasant happened at this end. Could l come and see you?

1865
02:30:20,490 --> 02:30:22,480
可以，好，我马上过去
Well, l could, yes. Now, straight away?

1866
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:23,750
对，很好，谢谢
Right. Good. Thank you.

1867
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:25,920
再见，布鲁斯，非常感谢
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.

1868
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:36,200
皮尔斯太太，我去内政部一下
Mrs. Pearce, l'm going along to the Home Office.

1869
02:30:36,940 --> 02:30:39,230
我真的很希望你找到她 平克林上校
l do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

1870
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:41,030
席根斯先生很想她的
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

1871
02:30:41,140 --> 02:30:45,370
席根斯先生很想她的？ 管他席根斯先生，我也想念她
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh? Blast Mr. Higgins, l'll miss her!

1872
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:48,950
平克林？

1873
02:30:51,180 --> 02:30:52,620
平克林？
Pickering

1874
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:59,120
皮尔斯太太？ 是的，先生
-Mrs. Pearce? -Yes, sir.

1875
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:00,360
上校去哪里了？
Where's the Colonel?

1876
02:31:00,460 --> 02:31:03,260
他去内政部了
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

1877
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:09,460
你看看，我有麻烦他就帮忙 他真是我的好朋友
There you are. l'm disturbed and he runs for help. Now there's a good fellow.

1878
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:13,770
皮尔斯太太，你是一个女人
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

1879
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:17,800
为何女人不能像男人一般？
Why can't a woman be more like a man?

1880
02:31:17,910 --> 02:31:21,000
男人如此正派，标准的典型
Men are so decent Such regular chaps

1881
02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:24,280
只要你有麻烦，随时都会帮你
Ready to help you Through any mishaps

1882
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:27,440
只要你沮丧，随时都会振作你
Ready to buck you up Whenever you are glum

1883
02:31:27,550 --> 02:31:30,990
为何女人不能像男人？
Why can't a woman be a chum?

1884
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:34,790
为何女人不会思考？
Why is thinking Something women never do?

1885
02:31:34,890 --> 02:31:38,020
为何不会逻辑推理？
And why is logic never even tried?

1886
02:31:38,130 --> 02:31:41,070
只会整理她们的头发
Straightening up their hair ls all they ever do

1887
02:31:41,170 --> 02:31:44,690
为何不整理脑袋里的思绪？
Why don't they straighten up The mess that's inside?

1888
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:47,860
为何女人的行为不能像男人？
Why can't a woman behave like a man?

1889
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:51,140
如果我是参加舞会的女人
lf l was a woman Who'd been to a ball

1890
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:54,440
每个人待我像公主
Been hailed as a princess By one and by all

1891
02:31:54,550 --> 02:31:57,610
我是否会痛哭流涕？
Would l start weeping Like a bathtub overflowing?

1892
02:31:57,720 --> 02:32:00,710
或是无法住在这栋房子里？
Or carry on as if my home Were in a tree?

1893
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:03,880
我会不说一句走跑走吗？
Would l run off And never tell me where l'm going?

1894
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:07,690
为何女人不像我呢？
Why can't a woman be like me?

1895
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:15,760
你是说在你替他完成了 这项不可思议的任务后
You mean that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them... without making a mistake...

1896
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:17,800
他们只是坐下来 没跟你说一句话？
they just sat there and never said a word?

1897
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:21,700
没有称赞你，说你有多棒吗？
Never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you'd been?

1898
02:32:21,810 --> 02:32:22,670
一个字都没有
Not a word.

1899
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:25,740
他们只是互相庆贺 完成了一件多么不可思议的事
They just congratulated each other on how marvelous they'd been.

1900
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:28,310
然后庆幸这一切都过去了
The next moment, how glad they were it was all over...

1901
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:30,210
这舞会的过程有多无聊
and what a bore it had all been.

1902
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:33,340
这太不像话了 我不会只用拖鞋丢他
This is simply appalling. l should not have thrown my slippers at him.

1903
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:35,440
我会用火戳丢他
l should have thrown the fire irons.

1904
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:37,050
是谁？
Who's that?

1905
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:40,020
是亨利，我知道这不会很久的
Henry. l knew it wouldn't be too long.

1906
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:42,860
要记住...
Now, remember...

1907
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:47,560
你不只是昨晚跟王子跳舞 现在也要像是公主一般
you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess.

1908
02:32:54,940 --> 02:32:57,240
母亲，真令人不解...
Mother, the most confounded thing.... Do you--

1909
02:33:01,210 --> 02:33:02,240
是你！
You!

1910
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:05,640
午安，席根斯教授 你还好吧？
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins. Are you quite well?

1911
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:11,820
当然好，你从来没病过 你要喝茶吗？
Of course you are. You are never ill. Would you care for some tea?

1912
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:15,450
休想和我玩这把戏 是我教你这一切的
Don't you dare try that game on me. l taught it to you.

1913
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:17,190
起来，跟我回去 别像傻子一样
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

1914
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:18,790
你已经惹了不少麻烦
You've caused me enough trouble.

1915
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:22,890
真的是这样，亨利 没有女人能拒绝这种邀约的
Very nicely put indeed, Henry. No woman could resist such an invitation.

1916
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,770
这些袋子怎么会在这里？
How did this baggage get here?

1917
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:27,810
伊莱莎今早到这里来看我 我很高兴见到她
Eliza came to see me this morning and l was delighted to have her.

1918
02:33:27,910 --> 02:33:30,640
如果你不能乖乖的 我就要请你离开了
lf you don't promise to behave yourself l must ask you to leave.

1919
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:36,640
你是说我必须要对我所训练的 菜市场女人举止合宜吗？
You mean, l'm to put on my Sunday manners for this... thing that l created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

1920
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:38,080
我就是这个意思
That's precisely what l mean.

1921
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:40,150
真是不可理喻！

1922
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:42,950
你是如何从我儿子那里 学习当个淑女的？
However did you learn good manners with my son around?

1923
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:49,650
实在很困难，如果不是上校 我无法学会淑女和绅士的相处
lt was very difficult. l should never have known how ladies... and gentlemen behave if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

1924
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:57,030
他让我感受到 我并非只是个卖花女
He showed me that he felt and thought about me... as if l were something better than a common flower girl.

1925
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:03,540
席根斯夫人 有许多事情让人们可以学到...
You see, Mrs. Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up...

1926
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:07,840
淑女和卖花女的差别 并非在言行
the difference between a lady and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

1927
02:34:07,950 --> 02:34:09,570
而是人们对待她的态度
but how she is treated.

1928
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:18,060
在教授眼中我永远是个卖花女 因为他待我像卖花女
l shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins... because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.

1929
02:34:19,460 --> 02:34:24,460
而在上校眼中我永远是个淑女 因为他待我像是淑女
l know l'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering... because he always treats me as a lady and always will.

1930
02:34:29,870 --> 02:34:31,300
亨利，不要在那里磨牙
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

1931
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:34,200
夫人，主教来了 要我带他去花园吗？
The bishop is here, Madam. Shall l show him into the garden?

1932
02:34:34,310 --> 02:34:36,710
主教和教授？天啊，不要！
The bishop and the professor? Good heavens, no!

1933
02:34:36,910 --> 02:34:38,670
我会被逐出教会的
l should be excommunicated.

1934
02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:40,670
我在书房见他
l'll see him in the library.

1935
02:34:41,710 --> 02:34:47,050
伊莱莎，如果我儿子不讲理 你可以赶他出去
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things... l give you full permission to have him evicted.

1936
02:34:47,350 --> 02:34:51,720
亨利，我建议你谈两个话题 天气和健康
Henry dear, l suggest you stick to two subjects: the weather and your health.

1937
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:21,410
你可以在自由意愿下回去
You've had a bit of your own back, as you say.

1938
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:25,150
你玩够了没，你可以讲理了吗 还是要继续玩下去？
Have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more?

1939
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:27,020
你是要我回去帮你拿拖鞋
You want me back to pick up your slippers...

1940
02:35:27,130 --> 02:35:30,120
忍受你的脾气 然后料理你的杂事
and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.

1941
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:31,820
我没有说我要你回来
l didn't say l wanted you back at all.

1942
02:35:31,930 --> 02:35:33,490
真的吗？ 那我们还谈个什么劲？
lndeed? Then what are we talking about?

1943
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,260
是谈你，不是谈我
Well, about you, not about me.

1944
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:37,770
如果你回来 我对你的态度与往常一般
lf you come back you'll be treated as you've always been.

1945
02:35:37,870 --> 02:35:40,300
我不需要改变我的态度
l can't change my nature or my manners.

1946
02:35:40,410 --> 02:35:43,200
我的态度 跟平克林上校的是一样
My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.

1947
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:46,610
那不是事实 他对待卖花女好似伯爵夫人
That's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess.

1948
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:49,470
而我对待伯爵夫人 好似个卖花女
And l treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.

1949
02:35:49,580 --> 02:35:51,380
哦，原来如此，一视同仁
Oh, l see. The same to everybody.

1950
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:58,520
没错，重点不是 对某种人态度会有不同
You see, the great secret is not a question of good manners... or bad manners or any particular sort of manners...

1951
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:02,720
而是对所有人的态度都相同
but having the same manner for all human souls.

1952
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:06,660
问题不是我对你很无礼
The question is not whether l treat you rudely...

1953
02:36:06,770 --> 02:36:09,790
而是你有看过我对任何人好吗
but whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better.

1954
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:12,430
我不在乎你如何对待我
l don't care how you treat me.

1955
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:15,170
我不介意你用粗话骂我 我不介意自己丢脸
l don't mind your swearing at me. l shouldn't mind a black eye.

1956
02:36:15,270 --> 02:36:18,680
我曾经体会过 但是我不喜欢被忽视！
l've had one before this. But l won't be passed over!

1957
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:20,640
别挡路 我不会因你而停下来改变
Get out of my way, for l won't stop for you.

1958
02:36:20,750 --> 02:36:22,650
你说的我好像是部公车
You talk about me as though l was a motorbus.

1959
02:36:22,750 --> 02:36:26,910
你就是公车 只会来回的开不管乘客是谁
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go and no consideration for anybody.

1960
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:30,150
别以为我没有你就无法生存
But l can get along without you. Don't you think l can't!

1961
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:32,280
我知道你办得到 我说过你行的
l know you can. l told you, you could.

1962
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:38,330
你从未想过，我觉得...
You've never wondered, l suppose, whether...

1963
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:40,990
我是否能没有你呢？
whether l could get along without you?

1964
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:45,430
别想要改变我的想法 你必须要做到
Don't you try to get around me. You'll have to.

1965
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:48,900
所以我可以，没有你或任何人 我都可以活得下去
So l can, without you or any soul on Earth.

1966
02:36:52,410 --> 02:36:56,810
我会想念你的，伊莱莎 我从你身上也学了不少东西
l shall miss you, Eliza. l've learned something from your idiotic notions.

1967
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,950
我必须承认我由衷地感激
l confess that humbly and gratefully.

1968
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:05,150
你的留声机里有我的声音
Well, you have my voice on your gramophone.

1969
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:09,520
寂寞的时候可以打开听听 不会伤感的
When you feel lonely without me you can turn it on. lt has no feelings to hurt.

1970
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:14,200
我却无法敞开你的心灵
Well, l can't turn your soul on.

1971
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:18,930
哦，你真是个魔鬼
Oh, you are a devil!

1972
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:24,710
你还真会伤女孩的心
You can twist the heart in a girl just as easily... as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

1973
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:26,740
我还回去干什么？
What am l to come back for?

1974
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:29,240
为了乐趣，所以我才选了你
For the fun of it. That's why l took you on.

1975
02:37:29,350 --> 02:37:31,870
如果我不照你意思做 我就会被你赶出去
You may throw me out tomorrow if l don't do everything you want.

1976
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:35,610
但是我没照你的意思做事 你也可以马上离开我
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow if l don't do everything you want.

1977
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,880
去和我父亲住一起吗？
And live with my father?

1978
02:37:36,990 --> 02:37:39,320
是，或去卖花 还是你宁愿和上校结婚
Yes, or sell flowers. Would you rather marry Pickering?

1979
02:37:39,430 --> 02:37:43,290
如果你向我求婚我就嫁给你 起码年纪相近
l wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age then what he is.

1980
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,230
我喜欢说什么我就说 你已经不是我老师了
l'll talk as l like. You're not my teacher now.

1981
02:37:46,770 --> 02:37:49,230
结婚不是我想要的 你不用这样想
That's not what l want and don't you think it is.

1982
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:51,900
我有许多人在追求我
l've always had chaps enough wanting me that way.

1983
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,060
佛雷狄希尔 一天就写好几封信给我
Freddy Hill writes me twice and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

1984
02:37:55,170 --> 02:37:58,870
搞半天，原来你要我 像他对你一般痴情
ln short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

1985
02:37:59,240 --> 02:38:03,240
不是，我不是要你如此对待我
No, l don't. That's not the sort of feeling l want from you.

1986
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:05,840
我只求你待我亲切一些
l want a little kindness.

1987
02:38:06,690 --> 02:38:09,980
我知道我是微不足道的卖花女 你是丰富学识的绅士
l know l'm a common, ignorant girl, and you're a book-learned gentleman...

1988
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:12,250
但我不是你脚下的烂泥
but l'm not dirt under your feet.

1989
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:17,920
我所做的并非是为了物质享受
What l done...what l did was not for the taxis and the dresses...

1990
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:22,260
只是因为我们在一起 相处的很愉快，我就...
but because we were pleasant together and l come to...came...

1991
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:24,600
关心你
to care for you.

1992
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:26,570
并非想要跟你结婚
Not to want you to make love to me...

1993
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:29,300
也没忘记你我身份的悬殊 但是...
and not forgetting the difference between us, but...

1994
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:31,940
只希望我们能更像朋友一样
more friendly like.

1995
02:38:33,950 --> 02:38:36,240
当然，我的想法也和你一样
Well, of course. That's how l feel.

1996
02:38:36,820 --> 02:38:40,620
上校也如此想 伊莱莎，你真傻
And how Pickering feels. Eliza, you're a fool!

1997
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:42,080
这样回答太不合宜了
That's not the proper answer.

1998
02:38:42,190 --> 02:38:43,880
除非你变聪明 否则还是这样的回答
lt's the only answer till you stop being a idiot.

1999
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:46,120
如果你要成为淑女 就必须独立自主
lf you want to be a lady, you must stop feeling neglected...

2000
02:38:46,230 --> 02:38:50,790
如果男人不会在你身边哭诉 不会让你丢脸
if the men don't spend half their time sniveling over you... and the other half giving you black eyes.

2001
02:38:50,860 --> 02:38:53,660
你认为我冷淡 没有感情，自私，是吗？
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?

2002
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:55,630
去跟你喜欢的人在一起
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2003
02:38:55,730 --> 02:39:00,500
嫁给感情丰富的贪婪有钱人 用厚嘴唇亲你，用大靴子踢你
Marry a sentimental hog with lots of money... and thick lips to kiss you, and thick boots to kick you.

2004
02:39:00,570 --> 02:39:03,470
如果你无法知足常乐 千万不要乐极生悲
lf you can't appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate.

2005
02:39:03,740 --> 02:39:06,910
我说不赢你 你永远有理由反驳我
l can't talk to you. You always turn everything against me.

2006
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,570
我永远都是错的
l'm always in the wrong.

2007
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:13,380
别太有自信 你可以如此践踏和贬低我
Don't be too sure you have me under your feet... to be trampled on and talked down.

2008
02:39:13,490 --> 02:39:16,510
我要嫁给佛雷狄 一旦我有能力养他就会嫁给他
l'll marry Freddy, l will, as soon as l'm able to support him.

2009
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:18,620
佛雷狄
Freddy

2010
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:21,090
那可怜的家伙 连跑腿的小事都作不了
That poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy...

2011
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:23,130
他还敢尝试要娶你？
even if he had the guts to try for it?

2012
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:26,990
女人，你还不明白？ 你已经有资格嫁给国王了
Woman, don't you understand? l have made you a consort for a king!

2013
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:30,140
佛雷狄爱我 在我心中他就是个国王
Freddy loves me. That makes him king enough for me.

2014
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:33,200
我不要他去工作 他不像我做惯苦力的事情
l don't want him to work. He wasn't brought up to do it as l was.

2015
02:39:33,310 --> 02:39:34,740
我要去当老师
l'll go and be a teacher.

2016
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:37,430
你能教些什么东西？
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2017
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:40,240
你所教我的，我可以教语言学
What you taught me. l'll teach phonetics.

2018
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:48,890
我可以当那个匈牙利人的助手
l'll offer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungarian.

2019
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:53,350
那个骗子，冒牌货 无知的马屁精？
What, that imposter? That humbug? That toadying ignoramus?

2020
02:39:53,660 --> 02:39:55,790
教他我发明的方法？
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

2021
02:39:55,890 --> 02:39:58,490
你再往那个方向做一步 我就拧断你的脖子！
You take one step in that direction, l'll wring your neck!

2022
02:39:58,600 --> 02:40:02,360
拧死我，我在乎什么？ 我早知道有一天你会打我
Wring away! What do l care? l knew you'd strike me one day.

2023
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:08,270
这个真的整倒你了吧，席根斯
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2024
02:40:08,370 --> 02:40:11,600
我才不管你的霸道 或是你的大话
Now, l don't care for your bullyin' an' your big talk.

2025
02:40:12,750 --> 02:40:14,610
我真的是太傻了
What a fool l was

2026
02:40:14,710 --> 02:40:16,510
真是一个超级大傻瓜
What a dominated fool

2027
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:19,410
竟以为你是天与地
To think you were the Earth and sky

2028
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:21,680
我真的是太傻了
What a fool l was

2029
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:23,580
真是呆头呆脑
What an addle-pated fool

2030
02:40:23,690 --> 02:40:27,850
我真是个大笨蛋
What a mutton-headed dolt was l

2031
02:40:28,030 --> 02:40:36,760
错了，朋友，你不是我的全部
No, my reverberating friend You are not the beginning and the end

2032
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,700
你这冒失的野丫头！
You impudent hussy!

2033
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:45,270
你的思想谈吐 都是我赐给你的
There's not an idea in your head or a word in your mouth that l haven't put there.

2034
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:51,910
没有你春天依旧来
There'll be spring every year Without you

2035
02:40:52,020 --> 02:40:55,680
没有你英国依然在
England still will be here Without you

2036
02:40:55,790 --> 02:40:59,590
树果依然茂盛，海岸仍旧存在
There'll be fruit on the tree And a shore by the sea

2037
02:40:59,690 --> 02:41:03,460
没有你下午茶照常
There'll be crumpets and tea Without you

2038
02:41:03,560 --> 02:41:07,160
没有你艺术与音乐盛况依旧
Art and music will thrive Without you

2039
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:10,960
没有你济慈作品仍在
Somehow Keats will survive Without you

2040
02:41:11,070 --> 02:41:18,640
没有你西班牙平原照常下雨
And there still will be rain On that plain down in Spain Even that will remain Without you

2041
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:24,550
没有你我也可活下去
l can do Without you

2042
02:41:25,220 --> 02:41:32,390
我口齿伶俐的朋友
You, dear friend Who talk so well

2043
02:41:32,490 --> 02:41:39,450
你可以去哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡
You can go to Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

2044
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:43,060
没有你国家依旧运行
They can still rule the land Without you

2045
02:41:43,170 --> 02:41:46,760
没有你温莎堡依旧屹立
Windsor Castle will stand Without you

2046
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:52,670
没有你一切都会顺利
And without much ado We can all muddle through Without you!

2047
02:41:52,780 --> 02:41:55,180
你这个厚颜无耻的野丫头！
You brazen hussy!

2048
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:59,410
没有你潮汐依旧
Without your pulling it The tide comes in

2049
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:03,450
没有你自转依旧
Without your twirling it The Earth can spin

2050
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:08,750
没有你浮云依旧
Without your pushing them The clouds roll by

2051
02:42:08,860 --> 02:42:14,360
如果没有你这些依旧 我也可以没有你
lf they can do without you, Ducky So can l

2052
02:42:14,470 --> 02:42:17,770
没有你我不孤独
l shall not feel alone Without you

2053
02:42:17,870 --> 02:42:21,470
没有你我可以自立
l can stand on my own Without you

2054
02:42:21,570 --> 02:42:26,030
所以回到你的巢穴里 我只能...
So go back in your shell l can do bloody well--

2055
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:30,080
老天啊，我真的办到了...
By George, l really did it l did it, l did it

2056
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:32,780
我说我可以改变一个女人 我真的办到了
l said l'd make a woman And indeed l did

2057
02:42:32,890 --> 02:42:35,650
我知道我办得到，我就知道
l knew that l could do it l knew it, l knew it

2058
02:42:35,750 --> 02:42:38,660
我说我可以改变一个女人 我真的成功了
l said l'd make a woman And succeed l did

2059
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:40,750
伊莱莎，你真的很不可思议
Eliza, you're magnificent.

2060
02:42:40,860 --> 02:42:43,380
五分前你还是我沉重的负担
Five minutes ago you were a millstone around my neck...

2061
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:45,490
现在你已充满了活力
and now you're a tower of strength.

2062
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:47,390
战力的结合
A consort battleship.

2063
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:50,400
我喜欢你这个样子
l like you this way.

2064
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:56,270
再见，席根斯教授 你不会再见到我了
Goodbye, Professor Higgins. You shall not be seeing me again.

2065
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,980
母亲！
Mother!

2066
02:43:12,390 --> 02:43:13,450
母亲！
Mother!

2067
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:16,390
怎么了，亨利？发生什么事？
What is it, Henry? What's happened?

2068
02:43:18,330 --> 02:43:19,490
她走了
She's gone.

2069
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:21,960
当然，亲爱的 你还在指望什么？
Well, of course, dear. What did you expect?

2070
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:26,800
我该怎么办？
What am l to do?

2071
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:28,370
你只好过没有她的日子了
Do without, l suppose.

2072
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:32,070
我会的
And so l shall.

2073
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:38,340
如果我能让她燃起怒火
lf the Higgins' oxygen burns up her little lungs...

2074
02:43:38,450 --> 02:43:41,010
让她找适合她的灭火方式
let her seek some stuffiness that suits her.

2075
02:43:42,020 --> 02:43:45,580
她就像猫头鹰一样 讨厌我给的阳光
She's an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine.

2076
02:43:45,890 --> 02:43:47,860
让她走好了，我不需要她
Let her go. l can do without her.

2077
02:43:47,960 --> 02:43:50,260
我并不需要任何人 我有自己的灵魂
l can do without anyone. l have my own soul!

2078
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:53,330
我自己求爱的欲火！
My own spark of divine fire!

2079
02:43:57,570 --> 02:43:58,900
干得好，伊莱莎
Bravo, Eliza.

2080
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:22,490
该死...
Damn, damn, damn, damn

2081
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:27,260
我已经习惯她的脸庞了
l've grown accustomed to her face

2082
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,930
她几乎是让一天开始的泉源
She almost makes the day begin

2083
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:37,200
我习惯她的声调 还有她日夜的口哨声
l've grown accustomed to the tune That she whistles night and noon

2084
02:44:37,410 --> 02:44:41,180
她的微笑，蹙眉 她的得意和失望
Her smiles, her frowns Her ups, her downs

2085
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:43,270
现在成为我生活的一部分
Are second nature to me now

2086
02:44:44,420 --> 02:44:46,680
像是呼吸般不可或缺
Like breathing out and breathing in

2087
02:44:47,790 --> 02:44:51,650
在我们未见面之前 我是非常独立和满足
l was serenely independent and content Before we met

2088
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:55,660
我当然可以再回复 那种生活方式
Surely l could always be that way again

2089
02:44:57,060 --> 02:45:01,120
但我已习惯了她的模样
And yet l've grown Accustomed to her looks

2090
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:03,260
习惯她的声音
Accustomed to her voice

2091
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:08,530
习惯她的脸庞
Accustomed to her face

2092
02:45:22,390 --> 02:45:24,250
嫁给佛雷狄
Marry Freddy.

2093
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:29,020
多幼稚的想法，多么没良心 缺德，没大脑的事
What an infantile idea. What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do.

2094
02:45:29,130 --> 02:45:32,430
但是她会后悔的...
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.

2095
02:45:32,530 --> 02:45:36,190
在还没发誓前 整件事就注定要失败！
lt's doomed before they even take the vow!

2096
02:45:36,740 --> 02:45:40,540
我可以想像她当 佛雷狄恩斯福特希尔夫人模样
l can see her now Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill

2097
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:43,230
在一个悲惨的小店里
ln a wretched little flat above a store

2098
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:46,700
我可以想像她 收银机里没半毛钱
l can see her now, not a penny in the till

2099
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:49,440
而收款员却不停地敲门
And a bill collector beating at the door

2100
02:45:49,950 --> 02:45:55,610
她想当老师 而最后还是去卖花了
She'll try to teach the things l taught her And end up selling flowers instead

2101
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:58,250
当她为生活奋力挣扎时
Begging for her bread and water

2102
02:45:58,360 --> 02:46:01,550
她先生却在床上用早餐
While her husband has His breakfast in bed

2103
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:09,190
再过几年，她的头发就变白
ln a year or so When she's prematurely gray

2104
02:46:09,300 --> 02:46:12,670
粉嫩的脸颊成死槁
And the blossom in her cheek Has turned to chalk

2105
02:46:12,770 --> 02:46:18,980
她回到家一看，她先生就吓跑 高攀有钱的女人私奔了
She'll come home and lo He'll have upped and run away With a social-climbing heiress From New York

2106
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:20,610
多可怜的伊莱莎
Poor Eliza

2107
02:46:20,710 --> 02:46:22,240
多么地可怕
How simply frightful

2108
02:46:22,350 --> 02:46:24,510
多么地丢人
How humiliating

2109
02:46:24,620 --> 02:46:26,610
多么地令人欣慰
How delightful

2110
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:31,890
在一个令人心酸的晚上
How poignant it will be On that inevitable night

2111
02:46:31,990 --> 02:46:35,190
她一身破烂又带泪来我家叩门
When she hammers on my door ln tears and rags

2112
02:46:35,290 --> 02:46:38,960
悲惨又孤独，忏悔又懊恼
Miserable and lonely Repentant and contrite

2113
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:41,760
我该收容她？ 还是让她受尽凌辱？
Will l take her in Or hurl her to the wolves?

2114
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:44,930
亲切地待她？ 还是给她颜色看？
Give her kindness Or the treatment she deserves?

2115
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:48,940
该让她回来？ 还是将她赶出去？
Will l take her back Or throw the baggage out?

2116
02:46:51,310 --> 02:46:53,540
我是个心胸宽大的人
Well, l'm a most forgiving man

2117
02:46:53,950 --> 02:46:57,310
不会是也不曾是狠心的人
The sort who never could, ever would

2118
02:46:57,420 --> 02:47:01,320
人同此心，心同此理
Take a position and staunchly never budge

2119
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:06,110
我是个心胸宽大的人
A most forgiving man

2120
02:47:08,690 --> 02:47:11,130
但我不该收容她！
But l shall never take her back

2121
02:47:11,860 --> 02:47:13,830
如果她跪在地上
lf she were crawling on her knees

2122
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:17,400
让她哀求 让她受冻，让她呻吟
Let her promise to atone Let her shiver, let her moan

2123
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:21,840
我会把门重重地关上 让这泼妇冻死
l'll slam the door And let the hellcat freeze

2124
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:26,300
嫁给佛雷狄
Marry Freddy.

2125
02:47:40,690 --> 02:47:46,150
但是我已经习惯 每天听她向我说早安
But l'm so used to hear her say ''Good morning'' every day

2126
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:48,790
她的欣喜，她的苦恼
Her joys, her woes

2127
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:51,560
她的兴奋，她的低落
Her highs, her lows

2128
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:55,070
现在已经成为我生活的一部分
Are second nature to me now

2129
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:58,510
像是呼吸般不可或缺
Like breathing out and breathing in

2130
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:04,270
我真的很庆幸是女人 我才能很容易地忘记她
l'm very grateful she's a woman And so easy to forget

2131
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:08,550
不会难以忘怀
Rather like a habit One can always break

2132
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:15,590
然而我却已习惯了她的身影
And yet l've grown Accustomed to the trace

2133
02:48:15,730 --> 02:48:25,430
然而我已习惯了她在的气息
Of something in the air Accustomed to her face

2134
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:03,690
哦，都很骄傲
Oh, we are proud.

2135
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:07,200
他不想教人说英语 但是我听到他说过的
He ain't above givin'lessons, not 'im. l 'eard 'im say so.

2136
02:50:07,310 --> 02:50:09,470
我不是来此致意的
l ain't come here to ask for any compliment...

2137
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:12,630
如果我的钱不够我就去别处
and if my money's not good enough, l can go elsewhere.

2138
02:50:12,710 --> 02:50:13,940
够做什么？
Good enough for what?

2139
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:16,980
足够支付你上课的钱 懂了吗？
Good enough for you. Now you know, don'tcha?

2140
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:20,410
我来这里上课的 并且是付学费，别搞错了
l'm come to 'ave lessons, l am. And to pay for 'em, too... make no mistake.

2141
02:50:20,490 --> 02:50:22,180
你想要干什么，女孩？
What is it you want, my girl?

2142
02:50:22,290 --> 02:50:28,390
我想要在花店当专柜小姐
l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop 'stead o' sellin'... at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

2143
02:50:28,490 --> 02:50:31,760
除非我举止优雅 否则他们不会请我
But they won't take me unless l can talk more genteel.

2144
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:33,560
他说他能教我
He said he could teach me.

2145
02:50:33,670 --> 02:50:35,690
所以我来付钱请他教
Well, 'ere l am ready to pay,

2146
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:39,240
不是要来占便宜的 他却如此对我
not askin' any favor, and he treats me as if l was dirt.

2147
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:43,330
我知道你上课的价钱 所以我准备要付钱
l know what lessons cost as well as you do and l'm ready t'pay.

2148
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:46,580
因此我只会给一先令 随便你要不要
l won't give more than a shillin'. Take it or leave it.

2149
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:51,410
这真是无法抗拒 她低俗的如此有趣
lt's almost irresistible. She's so deliciously low...

2150
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:54,610
真是脏死了，我接受
so horribly dirty. l'll take it.

2151
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:57,980
我会让她彻底的改头换面
l'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

2152
02:51:00,330 --> 02:51:03,560
我洗了脸洗了手才来的
l washed my face and 'ands before l come, l did.

2153
02:51:12,070 --> 02:51:13,660
伊莱莎
Eliza?

2154
02:51:17,710 --> 02:51:19,970
我那该死的拖鞋在哪里？
Where the devil are my slippers?
