{\fs11}Then what did you take down me words for?{\r}

81
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,130

{\fs11}Take it or leave it.{\r}

457
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,060
你知道吗 皮克林 如果你不把1先令仅仅当做1先令来看
{\fs11}Do you know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling not as a simple shilling{\r}

458
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,020
而是从这个女孩儿的收入百分比来看
{\fs11}but as a percentage of this girl's income,{\r}

459
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,060
这几乎相当于
{\fs11}it works out as fully equivalent{\r}

460
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,690
一位百万富翁拿出了60到70镑
{\fs11}of 60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.{\r}

461
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,200
以圣乔治名起誓 这太多了 这是我收的最多的一次
{\fs11}By George, it's enormous. lt's the biggest offer l ever had.{\r}

462
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,570
60镑？
{\fs11}Sixty pounds?{\r}

463
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,030
你们在说什么？我上哪儿能弄来60镑？
{\fs11}What are you talking about? Where would l get 60 pounds?{\r}

464
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,450
我根本没说过要付你60镑
{\fs11}l never offered you 60 pounds.{\r}

465
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,830
- 把嘴闭上 - 可我根本没有60镑
{\fs11}- Hold your tongue. - But l ain't got 60 pounds.{\r}

466
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,410
别哭了 傻丫头
{\fs11}Don't cry, you silly girl.{\r}

467
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,960
坐下吧 没人想碰你的钱
{\fs11}Sit down. Nobody's going to touch your money.{\r}

468
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,040
要是你还是继续痛哭流涕个没完
{\fs11}Somebody's going to touch you with a broomstick{\r}

469
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,590
有人就要用笤帚打你了 坐下！
{\fs11}if you don't stop sniveling. Sit down!{\r}

00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,510

{\fs11}Oh, anybody would think you was my father.{\r}

472
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,850

{\fs11}- What's this for? - To wipe your eyes.{\r}

{\fs11}To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.{\r}

477
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,730
记住 这就是你的手绢而这就是你的袖子
{\fs11}And remember, that's your handkerchief and that's your sleeve.{\r}

478
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,530
别把它们搞混了
{\fs11}And don't confuse the one with the other{\r}

479
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,320

{\fs11}if you want to become a lady in a shop.{\r}

480
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,610
您跟她那样讲没用 希金斯先生
{\fs11}lt's no use to talk to her like that, Mr. Higgins.{\r}

481
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,160
她根本不明白你在说什么
{\fs11}She doesn't understand you.{\r}

482
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,080
- 噢 把手绢给我 - 这手绢是他给我的 不是你
{\fs11}Here, give the handkerchief to me. He give it to me, not to you.{\r}

483
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,160
希金斯 我很好奇
{\fs11}Higgins, l'm interested.{\r}

484
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,870
你夸口说你能让她变得像公爵夫人一般
{\fs11}What about your boast that you could pass her off as a duchess{\r}

485
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,420
出席大使招待舞会 嗯？
{\fs11}at the Embassy Ball, eh?{\r}

486
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,420
如果你真能办到 我得说你就是这个世界上最伟大的老师
{\fs11}l'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you can make that good.{\r}

487
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,380
我打赌你办不到 否则这个试验的所有的费用由我承担
{\fs11}l'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can't do it.{\r}

488
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,510
甚至连她的学费我也一并支付
{\fs11}l'll even pay for the lessons.{\r}

489
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,470
噢 您真好 谢谢您 上校
{\fs11}Oh, you're real good. Thank you, captain.{\r}

490
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,020
要知道 这赌注很难拒绝
{\fs11}You know, it's almost irresistible.{\r}

491
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,690
她的品味如此低俗
{\fs11}She's so deliciously low.{\r}

492
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,360
如此肮脏可怖
{\fs11}So horribly dirty.{\r}

493
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,610
我才不脏
{\fs11}l ain't dirty.{\r}

494
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,940
我来之前洗过脸还有手 真的
{\fs11}l washed my face and hands before l come, l did.{\r}

495
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,190
我愿意同您打这个赌
{\fs11}l'll take it.{\r}

496
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,360
我会将她从贫民区的邋遢女孩儿变为一位公爵夫人
{\fs11}l'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.{\r}

497
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,200
今天就开始 现在 此时此刻起 皮尔斯太太 带她出去把她弄干净
{\fs11}We'll start today. Now. This moment. Take her away and clean her.{\r}

498
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,200
要是洗不掉的就用砂纸
{\fs11}Sandpaper if it won't come off any other way.{\r}

499
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,460
- 现在厨房里还有火吗？ - 是的 不过...
{\fs11}- Is there a good fire in the kitchen? - Yes, but--{\r}

500
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,040
把她所有的衣服都拿去 烧了 给她订做新的
{\fs11}Take all her clothes, burn them, and order new ones.{\r}

501
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,340
在新衣服送来之前先用牛皮纸把她裹起来
{\fs11}Just wrap her in brown paper till they come.{\r}

502
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,380
你这样太不绅士了 你怎么能这样说话
{\fs11}You're no gentleman. You're not to talk of such things.{\r}

503
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,010
我可是个品行端正的女孩儿 我是认真的
{\fs11}l'm a good girl, I am.{\r}

504
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,430
我也知道你是什么样的人 真的
{\fs11}And l know what the likes of you are, l do.{\r}

505
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,890
你这种贫民区出来的人用不着在我们面前装什么矜持 年轻的小姐
{\fs11}We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman.{\r}

506
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,220
你只要学会让自己的举止像一位公爵夫人就可以了
{\fs11}You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.{\r}

507
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,680
现在带她出去 皮尔斯太太
{\fs11}Now take her away, Mrs. Pearce.{\r}

508
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,600
要是她跟你捣乱的话 你就好好教训她
{\fs11}lf she gives you any trouble, wallop her.{\r}

509
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,690
我会叫警察的 我发誓
{\fs11}l'll call the police, l will.{\r}

510
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,440
我没地方让她住
{\fs11}l've got no place to put her.{\r}

511
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,280
- 这样吧 让她住在垃圾箱里 - 啊噢!
{\fs11}- Well, put her in the dustbin. - Ow!{\r}

512
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,650
别这样 希金斯 你这样太不近情理了
{\fs11}Come, Higgins, be reasonable.{\r}

513
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,030
你必须合乎情理一点儿 希金斯先生 我说真的
{\fs11}You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins, really, you must.{\r}

514
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,870
你不可以像这样作践别人
{\fs11}You can't walk over everybody like this.{\r}

515
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,210
我吗？
{\fs11}l?{\r}

516
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,080
我有作践别人？
{\fs11}Walk over everybody?{\r}

517
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,540
我亲爱的皮尔斯太太 还有我亲爱的皮克林
{\fs11}My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering.{\r}

518
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,540
我从没想过要作践谁
{\fs11}l had no intention of walking over anybody.{\r}

519
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,590
我只是觉得我们应该对这个可怜的姑娘更好一点
{\fs11}l merely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.{\r}

520
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,630
我表达得不太清楚
{\fs11}l didn't express myself clearly{\r}

521
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,590
因为我不希望不符合她的品味
{\fs11}because l didn't wish to hurt her delicacy.{\r}

522
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,850
或者是你们的
{\fs11}Or yours.{\r}

523
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,140
可是 先生 您不能就这样把一个女孩儿带回来
{\fs11}But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that{\r}

524
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,730
就好像你在海滩上捡了块石头一样
{\fs11}as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.{\r}

525
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,000
为什么不行？
{\fs11}Why not?{\r}

526
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
为什么不行？

527
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,060
因为您一点都不了解她
{\fs11}But you don't know anything about her.{\r}

528
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,980
她的父母呢？她说不定已经结婚了
{\fs11}What about her parents? She may be married.{\r}

529
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,570
接着说
{\fs11}Garn.{\r}

530
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,320
看呐 要是这个女孩儿能正确的说出“说下去”
{\fs11}There. As the girl very properly says, "Garn."{\r}

531
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,120
有谁会和我结婚？
{\fs11}Who'd marry me?{\r}

532
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,080
我以圣乔治之名起誓 伊莱莎
{\fs11}By George, Eliza.{\r}

533
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:29,670
大街上会布满了因你而自杀的男人们的尸体
{\fs11}The streets will be strewn with the bodies of men{\r}

534
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,920
在我将你重新打造之前
{\fs11}shooting themselves for your sake before l'm done with you.{\r}

535
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,340
听着 我要离开这儿
{\fs11}Here. l'm going.{\r}

536
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,430
他在说胡话 绝对是这样
{\fs11}He's off his chump, he is.{\r}

537
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,140
- 我可不想让这样的蠢货教我 - 噢 疯子 我是吗？
{\fs11}- I don't want no barmies teaching me. - Oh, mad, am l?{\r}

538
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,470
那好 皮尔斯太太 别打电话订什么新衣服了
{\fs11}All right, don't ring up and order those clothes.{\r}

539
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,890
- 把她扔出去 - 不 希金斯先生 我可不能这样做
{\fs11}- Throw her out. - Stop, Mr. Higgins, l won't allow it.{\r}

540
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,230
回家去找你父母吧 丫头
{\fs11}Go home to your parents.{\r}

541
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,060
我没有父母
{\fs11}l ain't got no parents.{\r}

542
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,860
你听见了吧 她没有父母
{\fs11}There you are. She ain't got no parents.{\r}

543
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,520
有什么好奇怪的？没人会想要她
{\fs11}What's all the fuss? Nobody wants her.{\r}

544
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,690
她对任何人都是废物 除了我 带她上楼去
{\fs11}She's no use to anybody but me. Take her upstairs.{\r}

545
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,150
您打算拿她怎么办？让她做什么活儿付给她钱吗？
{\fs11}But what's to become of her? ls she to be paid anything?{\r}

546
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,320
噢 麻烦您理智一点儿 先生
{\fs11}Oh, do be sensible, sir.{\r}

547
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,910
她要钱干什么？她有的吃穿就够了
{\fs11}What would she do with money? She'll have food and clothes.{\r}

548
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,700
要是你给她钱 她就只会拿去喝酒
{\fs11}She'll only drink if you give her money.{\r}

549
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,200
噢 你真是个畜生 这是在胡说
{\fs11}Oh, you are a brute. It's a lie.{\r}

550
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,620
从来就没人见过我喝酒
{\fs11}Nobody ever saw the sign of liquor on me.{\r}

551
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,790
噢 先生 您是位绅士 求您让他别这样说我
{\fs11}Oh, sir, you're a gentleman. Don't let him speak to me like that.{\r}

552
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,960
你有没有想过希金斯 这个女孩儿也是有感情的？
{\fs11}Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feelings?{\r}

553
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,470
噢 不 我没想过 我们可不用担心她的感受
{\fs11}Oh, no, l don't think so. No feelings we need worry about.{\r}

554
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,720
嗯 你有吗 伊莱莎？
{\fs11}Well, have you, Eliza?{\r}

555
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,260
我同任何人一样有自己的感情
{\fs11}l got my feelings same as anyone else.{\r}

556
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,640
希金斯先生 我想我必须得知道这个女孩儿在这儿要待多久
{\fs11}Mr. Higgins, l must know on what terms the girl is to be here.{\r}

557
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,270
等你教完她 要拿她怎么办？
{\fs11}What's to become of her when you've finished your teaching?{\r}

558
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,060
您必须得看得更远一点儿 先生
{\fs11}You must look ahead a little, sir.{\r}

559
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,400
要是我们把她送回贫民区会怎样 皮尔斯太太？
{\fs11}What's to become of her if we leave her in the gutter?{\r}

560
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,860
- 请回答我 皮尔斯太太 - 那是她自己的事 用不着你管
{\fs11}- Answer me that, Mrs. Pearce. - That's her own business, not yours.{\r}

561
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,150
等我把她教完 我们就把她扔回去 之后就是她自己的事了
{\fs11}When l'm done, we'll throw her back, then it will be her own business again.{\r}

562
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,650
这样就没问题了吧 不是吗？
{\fs11}That will be all right, won't it?{\r}

563
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,530
你根本就没有同情心
{\fs11}You've no feeling heart in you.{\r}

564
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,240
你除了你自己什么都不关心
{\fs11}You don't care for nothing but yourself.{\r}

565
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,910
我受够了 我现在就要走 我是认真的
{\fs11}l've had enough of this. l'm going, l am.{\r}

566
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,000
你该为自己感到羞耻
{\fs11}You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you ought.{\r}

567
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,460
吃点儿巧克力吧 伊莱莎
{\fs11}Have some chocolates, Eliza.{\r}

{\fs11}lf the king finds out that you're not a lady,{\r}

598
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,260

{\fs11}this chap's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric.{\r}

911
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,430
请注意他说话时如林中鸟叫般的节奏
{\fs11}Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.{\r}

912
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,720
“我这就要告诉你 我正想要告诉你
{\fs11}"l'm willing to tell you. l'm wanting to tell you.{\r}

913
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:39,140
我正迫不及待的要告诉你”这就是他变形的威尔士口音
{\fs11}l'm waiting to tell you." That's the Welsh strain in him.{\r}

914
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,980
要不是你把她送来的你怎么知道伊莱莎在这儿？
{\fs11}How did you know Eliza was here if you didn't send her?{\r}

915
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,190
嗯 她送信说要取走她的行李 我正好听说了
{\fs11}Well, she sent back for her luggage and l got to hear about it.{\r}

916
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,610
还说所有的衣服她都不要了
{\fs11}She said she didn't want no clothes.{\r}

917
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,410
听到这些我会怎么想 先生？
{\fs11}What was l to think from that, governor?{\r}

918
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,660
请问你 作为一位父亲 我会怎么想？
{\fs11}l ask you, as a parent, what was l to think?{\r}

919
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,790
那么你是来趁她还活着赶来救她的吗 嗯？
{\fs11}So you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?{\r}

920
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,460
没错 先生 正是这样
{\fs11}Just so, governor, that's right.{\r}

921
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,750
那好
{\fs11}Yes.{\r}

922
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,580
皮尔斯太太
{\fs11}Mrs. Pearce.{\r}

923
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,750
皮尔斯太太 伊莱莎的父亲要带她走了
{\fs11}Mrs. Pearce, Eliza's father has come to take her away.{\r}

924
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,090
把她交给他 好吗？
{\fs11}Give her to him, will you?{\r}

925
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,510
噢 等等 先生 等等
{\fs11}Now, wait a minute, governor, wait a minute.{\r}

926
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,600
你我都是男人 不是吗？
{\fs11}You and me is men of the world, ain't we?{\r}

927
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:17,350
噢 我们都是男人 不是吗？
{\fs11}Oh, men of the world, are we?{\r}

928
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,940
- 好吧 你先出去 皮尔斯太太 - 我确实也是那样想的 先生
{\fs11}- Yes, you better go, Mrs. Pearce. - I think so indeed, sir.{\r}

929
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,190
嘿 先生
{\fs11}Here, governor.{\r}

930
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,070
我本以为你是抱着某种想法
{\fs11}l've took a sort of a fancy to you and--{\r}

931
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,860
{\fs11}[LAUGHS]{\r}

932
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,200
如果你想要这个女孩儿 那好吧 我也就不坚持要把她带回去了
{\fs11}lf you want the girl, well, l ain't so set on having her back home again,{\r}

933
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,700
不过我还是得把话说清楚
{\fs11}but what l might be open to is an arrangement.{\r}

934
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,250
我所要求的不过是一位父亲正当的权利
{\fs11}All I ask is my rights as a father.{\r}

935
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,170
即便是这世上就你最后一个男人 您也不会指望我什么都不要就让她跟你走吧
{\fs11}You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.{\r}

936
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,540
噢 我看得出您是那种正直的人 先生
{\fs11}Oh, l can see you're one of the straight sort, governor.{\r}

937
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,670
因此 您觉得5张1英镑的对您来说算什么？
{\fs11}So, what's a 5-pound note to you?{\r}

938
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,550
我的伊莱莎总值这个价吧？
{\fs11}And what's Eliza to me?{\r}

939
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,220
我想应该让你知道 杜利特
{\fs11}l think you ought to know, Doolittle,{\r}

940
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,350
这位希金斯先生把你女儿接到这里 用意是绝对高尚的
{\fs11}that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable.{\r}

941
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,270
当然是这样 先生
{\fs11}Of course they are, governor.{\r}

942
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,980
要不是这样 我会要50镑的
{\fs11}lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.{\r}

943
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,270
你的意思是说你打算以50镑卖掉你的女儿？
{\fs11}Do you mean to say you'd sell your daughter for 50 pounds?{\r}

944
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,980
你连一点道德都没有吗 伙计？
{\fs11}Have you no morals, man?{\r}

945
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,440
不 不 我可买不起它们 先生
{\fs11}No, no, l can't afford them, governor.{\r}

946
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,780
要是您跟我一样穷 你也会这样的
{\fs11}Neither could you if you was as poor as me.{\r}

947
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,410
我想提醒你们 我并没有什么恶意
{\fs11}Not that l mean any harm, mind you.{\r}

948
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,450
但既然伊莱莎可以得到一些好处的话
{\fs11}But if Eliza is gonna have a bit out of this,{\r}

949
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,870
那我为什么不能呢 嗯？
{\fs11}why not me too, eh?{\r}

950
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,120
为什么不能呢？
{\fs11}Why not?{\r}

951
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:25,790
噢 从我的角度来看
{\fs11}Well, look at it my way.{\r}

952
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,960
我是什么？我问你 我是什么？
{\fs11}What am l? l ask you, what am l?{\r}

953
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,590
我是个不值得可怜的人 就是这样
{\fs11}l'm one of the undeserving poor, that's what l am.{\r}

954
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,680
现在 想想看这对一个男人意味着什么
{\fs11}Now, think what that means to a man.{\r}

955
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,060
这意味着他一生都要同中产阶级所谓的道德观对抗
{\fs11}lt means he's up against middle-class morality for all of time.{\r}

956
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,560
不论发生什么 我想要的就只是得到点儿好处
{\fs11}lf there's anything going and l puts in for a bit of it,{\r}

957
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,850
结果往往都是这样
{\fs11}it's always the same story.{\r}

958
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,810
“你不配接受救济 所以不会给你”
{\fs11}"You're undeserving so you can't have it."{\r}

959
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,020
可我真的需要 就如同那些最需要救济的寡妇一样
{\fs11}But my needs is as great as the most deserving widows{\r}

960
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,240
她们每周都能从6个不同的慈善团体得到救济金
{\fs11}that ever got money out of six different charities in one week{\r}

961
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,570
只因为死了同一个丈夫
{\fs11}for the death of the same husband.{\r}

962
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,450
我要的不应该比一个需要救济的人少 而是更多
{\fs11}l don't need less than a deserving man, l need more.{\r}

963
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,830
我吃得不比他少
{\fs11}l don't eat less hearty than he does.{\r}

964
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,830
此外我还要喝酒 很多的酒
{\fs11}And l drink, oh, a lot more.{\r}

965
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,000
我实话跟你说吧 我不是装作需要救济
{\fs11}l'm playing straight with you. l ain't pretending to be deserving.{\r}
