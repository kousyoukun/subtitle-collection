1
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:58,478
Freddy, go and find a cab.

2
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,273
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

3
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,707
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

4
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,374
All right, I'll get one.

5
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,272
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

6
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,645
I'm so sorry.

7
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:42,692
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

8
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:47,243
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

9
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,163
He's your son, is he?

10
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,539
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

11
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:58,577
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

12
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:00,583
Go about your business, my girl.

13
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:03,463
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

14
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:06,633
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

15
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,348
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

16
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

17
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,398
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

18
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,273
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

19
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:21,775
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

20
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,487
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

21
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:27,068
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

22
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:30,366
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

23
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,834
Thank you, sir.

24
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,126
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

25
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,178
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

26
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:47,100
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

27
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:53,275
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

28
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:56,110
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

29
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:58,353
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

30
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:02,030
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

31
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:04,656
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

32
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,573
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

33
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:08,657
Who's doing all that shouting?

34
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:13,420
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

35
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:16,506
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

36
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:18,252
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

37
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:22,212
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

38
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,134
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

39
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,135
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

40
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,561
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

41
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,139
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

42
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,158
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

43
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,194
I can.

44
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:47,333
'"l say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl.'"

45
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,121
Oh, it's cause I called him '"Capt'n.'"

46
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:57,963
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

47
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,470
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

48
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,678
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

49
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,683
...until I ask you.

50
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:08,143
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

51
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:11,317
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

52
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,395
How are all your people down at Selsey?

53
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:15,979
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

54
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:17,616
Never mind, they do.

55
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:22,158
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

56
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:26,493
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

57
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:29,831
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

58
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,666
Live where you like but stop that noise!

59
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:35,293
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

60
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,261
I'm a good girl, I am.

61
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,214
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

62
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,055
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

63
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:46,312
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

64
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,481
Madam, it's stopped raining.

65
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:51,059
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

66
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:52,894
Isn't that where you live?

67
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,697
What impertinence!

68
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:58,693
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

69
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,619
Cheltenham, Harrow...

70
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,626
...Cambridge and...

71
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,752
...lndia?

72
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,039
Quite right.

73
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,710
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

74
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,639
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

75
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,847
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

76
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,268
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

77
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,063
How do you do it, may I ask?

78
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:29,025
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,572
Anyone can spot an lrishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

80
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:34,781
...but I can place a man within six miles.

81
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:38,736
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

82
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:41,619
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

83
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,583
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

84
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,004
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

85
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,081
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

86
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:53,048
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

87
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:56,719
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

88
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:59,770
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

89
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,392
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

90
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,274
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

91
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:07,029
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

92
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:10,197
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

93
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:14,446
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

I could get her a job as a lady's maid

00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:35,835
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

153
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,089
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?

154
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:42,346
I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.

155
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,923
I came from lndia to meet you!

156
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:47,260
I was going to lndia to meet you!

157
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,518
-Where are you staying?
-At the Carleton.

158
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,445
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.

159
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,317
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

160
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,400
Indian dialects have always fascinated me.

161
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,320
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.

162
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:03,361
Liar!

163
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,827
You said you could change half a crown.

164
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,451
You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought!

165
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:12,998
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket
for a sixpence!

166
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,756
A reminder.

167
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:24,515
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?

168
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:25,599
Indian dialects?

169
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:30,017
No fewer than 147 distinct languages
are recorded as vernacular in lndia.

170
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,616
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

171
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,366
Would you be lookin'
for a good butler, Eliza?

172
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,120
Well, you won't do.

It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:03,929
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

229
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,175
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

230
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:10,053
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,144
Life!

232
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,944
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

233
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,651
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

234
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:21,737
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

235
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,449
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

236
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,160
I give 'er all that.

237
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,831
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

238
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:34,211
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

239
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,458
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

...you better have a good story.

242

-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.

Why, Liza, what a surprise.

247

Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me.

248
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:36,681
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.

249
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,602
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

250
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,553

251
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,215
Not a brass farthin'.

252
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:14,596
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

253
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:17,051

...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

257
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,530

258
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,868
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

259
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,036
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

260
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:44,083
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

261
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,331
Come on.

262

to go 'ome on.

264

But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

265
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:02,108
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

266

...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

270
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,393
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

271
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:45,693
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

272

...which requires better English.

How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

277
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,467
I believe I counted 24.

278
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:44,679
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

279
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:46,890
Listen to them one at a time.

280

My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

One moment, please.

285
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:34,188
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

286
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:37,981
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

287
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,858
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

288
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,572
Could you tell me what it's about?

289
00:26:43,662 --> 00:26:46,450
It's business of a personal nature.

290
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:49,995
One moment, please.

291
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:02,266
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

292
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,888
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

293
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:06,176
A young woman?

294
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:08,351
What does she want?

295
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,192
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

296
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,316
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

297
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:15,396
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

298
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:18,276
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

299
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:21,368
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

300
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:25,615
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

301
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:29,623
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

302
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:32,880
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

303
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:37,380
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

304
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:42,433
This is the young woman, sir.

305
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,799
Good mornin', my good man.

306
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,805
Might I 'ave a word with you?

307
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,389
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

308
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:51,734
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

309
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:53,730
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

310
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:55,447
Be off with you. I don't want you.

311
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:58,700
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

312
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,661
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

313
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:03,784
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

314
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,038
...what you came in?

315
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:06,705
Oh, we are proud.

316
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:10,129
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

317
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:12,292
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

318
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:15,137
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

319
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:16,680
Good enough for what?

320
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:18,508
Good enough for you.

321
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:22,478
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

322
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:25,101
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

323
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,228
Well!

324
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:29,564
And what do you expect me to say?

325
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:33,862
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

326
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,655
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

327
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:39,369
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

328
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,864
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

329
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:46,004
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

330
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:49,006
What do you want, my girl?

331
00:28:53,138 --> 00:28:54,965
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

332
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:57,892
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

333
00:28:57,976 --> 00:29:00,728
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

334
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,093
He said 'e could teach me.

335
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,266
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

336
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:07,609
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

337
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,147
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

338
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,449
How much?

339
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:18,622
Now you're talkin'.

340
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,371
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

341
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,584
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

342
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,379
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

343
00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:26,663
Sit down.

344
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,003
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

345
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:33,177
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

346
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:35,099
What's your name?

347
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:37,135
Eliza Doolittle.

348
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:40,267
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

349
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:45,730
I don't mind if I do.

350
00:29:49,283 --> 00:29:52,403
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

351
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,114
Oh, I know what's right.

352
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:57,075
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

353
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,076
...from a real French gentleman.

354
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,494
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

355
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:04,423
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

356
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:07,877
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

357
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:13,098
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

358
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:17,431
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

359
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:20,477
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

360
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:24,649
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

361
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:28,905
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

362
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:33,205
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

363
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,662
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

364
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,375
But I ain't got 60 pounds!

365
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,245
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

366
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,673
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

367
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,923
Sit down!

368
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:52,429
Anybody'd think you was my father!

369
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,179
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

370
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:57,978
Here.

371
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,306
What's this for?

372
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:03,185
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

373
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:06,241
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

374
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:09,908
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

375
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:13,828
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

376
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:17,536
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

377
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:19,706
Higgins, I'm interested.

378
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:21,162
What about your boast...

379
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:24,129
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

380
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,055
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

381
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,268
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

382
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:33,186
I'll even pay for the lessons.

383
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:35,977
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

384
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,358
It's almost irresistible.

385
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:44,362
She's so deliciously low.

386
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,993
So horribly dirty.

387
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,654
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

388
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:53,698
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

389
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:57,621
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

390
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,131
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

391
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,255
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

392
00:32:04,347 --> 00:32:06,969
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

393
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:11,059
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

394
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,641
I'm a good girl, I am.

395
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,519
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

396
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:19,397
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

397
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:21,898
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

398
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:25,443
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

399
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,364
I'll call the police, I will.

400
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:29,081
I've got no place to put her.

401
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,123
Well, put her in the dustbin.

402
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:34,079
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

403
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:36,745
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

404
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:39,332
You can't walk over everybody like this.

405
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:43,128
I?

406
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:45,724
Walk over everybody?

407
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,973
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

408
00:32:50,064 --> 00:32:53,231
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

409
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,903
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

410
00:32:58,323 --> 00:32:59,438
...or yours.

411
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:02,617
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

412
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:05,408
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

413
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:06,660
Why not?

414
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:09,620
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

415
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:12,498
What about her parents?
She may be married.

416
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:13,959
Garn!

417
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,384
There. As the girl
very properly says, '"garn! '"

418
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:19,838
Who'd marry me?

419

464
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:38,489
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

465
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:41,583
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

466
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:46,212
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

467
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,468
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

468
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:56,554
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

469
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,471
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

470
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:05,860
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

471
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,402
But if you are naughty and idle...

472
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:12,326
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

473
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:15,447
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

474
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:20,623
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

475
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:23,370
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

476
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:27,545
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

477
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,967
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

478
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,058
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

479
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:39,513
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

480
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:43,812
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

481
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:47,071
If you refuse this offer...

482
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:51,107
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

483
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,155
...and the angels will weep for you!

484
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:01,630
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

485
00:37:01,715 --> 00:37:03,791
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

486
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:06,340
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

487
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:07,342
Come with me.

488
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:10,181
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

489
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,175
You're a great bully, you are!

490
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:15,518
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

491
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:17,313
Don't answer back, girl.

492
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:21,267
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

493
00:37:22,446 --> 00:37:25,696
In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

494
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:28,535
...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

495
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,289
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

496
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,708
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

497
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,466
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

498
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,342
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

499
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,388
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

500
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,641
It's too good for the likes o' me.

501
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,688
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

502
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,857
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

503
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,865
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

504
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:17,005
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

505
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,793
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

506
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:22,000
Not me!

507
00:38:28,476 --> 00:38:30,303
I shall catch me death.

508
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:34,095
Come along now.

509
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:35,854
Come along.

510
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:38,027
Take your clothes off.

511
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:41,990
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

512
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:44,447
Here, come on. Help me take these--

513
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:53,160
Take your hands off me!

514
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:16,026
I'm a good girl, I am!

515
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:21,402
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

516
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,410
Get your hands off me!

517
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:39,212
I'm a good girl, I am!

518
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:55,946
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

519
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:57,940
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.

520
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:01,983
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

521
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,749
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

522
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:07,833
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

523
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:11,370
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

524
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:15,668
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

525
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,754
Yes, very frequently.

526
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,264
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

527
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,639
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

528
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:25,970
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

529
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,359
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

530
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:34,027
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

531
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,274
Well, after all, Pickering....

I guess it's back to work.

610
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,529
Work! Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

611
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,496
Look at all these poor blighters down here.

612
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:16,582
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise.

613
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:19,844
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.

614
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,841
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.

615
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,840
How do you think you'll do that?

616
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:27,056
How? Same as always.

617
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:29,641
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

618

The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.

657
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:08,436
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

658
00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:10,901
Her former residence!

659
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:13,738
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

660
00:48:13,826 --> 00:48:15,784
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

661
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,151
What are you talkin' about?

662
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:18,527
Your daughter, Eliza.

663
00:48:18,623 --> 00:48:21,079
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

664
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:22,585
What about Eliza?

665
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:26,630
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.

666
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:33,003
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

667
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:36,099
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

668
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,510
An' ain't been home for three days.

669
00:48:38,603 --> 00:48:39,469
Go on.

670
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:41,769
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.

671
00:48:41,857 --> 00:48:44,064
She wants her things sent over...

672
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:47,236
...to 27A Wimpole Street...

673
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:49,648
...care of Professor Higgins.

674
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:53,068
An' what things does she want?

675
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,700
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

676
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:01,324
But she says:

677
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:05,123
'"Never mind about sending any clothes.'"

678
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:11,513
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

679
00:49:11,765 --> 00:49:14,221
We're in for a booze-up.

680
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:17,263
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

703
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:42,507
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

704

over and over...

...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

706

You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

707
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:54,147
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

708
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:57,734
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

709
00:51:57,822 --> 00:52:00,028
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

710
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:01,195
Throw it away.

711
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,783
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

712
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,786
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

713
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,006
If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

714
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,133
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

715
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,464
I say!

716
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,637
Well, send the blackguard up.

717
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:24,723
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

718
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,479
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

719
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:29,935
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

720
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:34,520
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

721

-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

723
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:49,909
Where?

724
00:52:50,463 --> 00:52:52,337
Good morning, Governor.

725
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:55,794
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

726
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,345
Brought up in Houndslow.

727
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,974
Mother Welsh, I should think.

728
00:53:04,979 --> 00:53:06,556
What is it you want, Doolittle?

729
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:09,185
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

730
00:53:09,275 --> 00:53:11,766
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

731
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:14,483
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

732
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:17,194
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

733
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:18,398
What?

734
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:22,902
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

735
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,792
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

736
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,997
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

737
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,422
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

738
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:36,550
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

739
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:39,096
You sent her here on purpose!

740
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:42,510
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

741
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,845
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

742
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:47,311
...a plot to extort money by threats.

743
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,357
I shall telephone the police.

744
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:52,487
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

745
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,573
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

746
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,819
Well, what else did you come for?

747
00:54:00,706 --> 00:54:02,699
What would a bloke come for?

748
00:54:03,084 --> 00:54:04,993
Be 'uman, Governor.

749
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:13,046
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

750
00:54:13,178 --> 00:54:14,838
So help me, Governor, I never did.

751
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,341
How did you know she was here?

752
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:19,303
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

753
00:54:19,393 --> 00:54:22,264
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

754
00:54:22,522 --> 00:54:24,313
I'm waiting to tell ya!

755
00:54:26,026 --> 00:54:30,071
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

756
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,198
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

757
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:37,401
'"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.'"

758
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:39,655
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

759
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,538
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

760
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:46,127
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

761
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:48,920
She said she didn't want no clothes.

762
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:54,214
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

763
00:54:54,682 --> 00:54:58,431
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

764
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,261
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

765
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:03,059
Mrs. Pearce!

766
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:07,936
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

767
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:11,446
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

768
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,079
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

769
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,661
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

770
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,459
I think so indeed, sir!

771
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:23,159
Here, Governor.

772
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:26,507
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

773
00:55:29,846 --> 00:55:33,215
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

774
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:36,226
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

775
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:39,053
All I ask is my rights as a father.

776
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:42,813
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

777
00:55:43,152 --> 00:55:46,402
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

778
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:47,520
So...

779
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:51,566
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

780
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:53,912
I think you should know, Doolittle...

781
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:57,164
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

782
00:55:57,543 --> 00:56:01,375
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

783
00:56:01,881 --> 00:56:04,716
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

784
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:06,544
Have you no morals, man?

785
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:13,636
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

786
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:15,934
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

787
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:19,521
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

788
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:21,897
Why not?

789
00:56:24,823 --> 00:56:27,314
Look at it my way. What am l?

790
00:56:28,326 --> 00:56:32,407
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

791
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:34,537
Think what that means to a man.

792
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:38,326
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

793
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:42,871
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

794
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:45,589
'"You're undeservin', so you can't have it.'"

795
00:56:45,762 --> 00:56:49,760
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

796
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:54,347
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

797
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:57,938
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

798
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:01,402
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

799
00:57:02,197 --> 00:57:03,442
...a lot more.

800
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,733
I'm playin' straight with you.

801
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:09,527
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

802
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,084
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

803
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:17,751
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

804
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:21,458
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

805
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,256
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

806
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:29,634
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

807
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:34,896
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

808
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:36,899
And I leave it to you.

809
00:57:39,738 --> 00:57:43,321
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

810
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:47,822
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

811
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:51,996
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

812
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:54,125
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

813
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:56,703
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

814
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:59,883
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

815
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:02,839
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

816
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,590
You couldn't spend it better.

817
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:07,434
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

818
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,017
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

819
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:11,813
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

820
00:58:11,898 --> 00:58:15,433
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

821
00:58:15,861 --> 00:58:19,906
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

822
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:23,324
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

823
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:25,487
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

824
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,996
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

825
00:58:29,084 --> 00:58:30,708
Who told you that, Governor?

826
00:58:30,794 --> 00:58:33,629
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

827
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:41,086
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

828
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,016
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

829
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,476
Are you sure you won't have ten?

830
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,849
No. No, perhaps another time.

831
00:58:49,815 --> 00:58:51,060
I beg your pardon, miss.

832
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:53,902
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

833
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:55,646
Blimey, it's Eliza.

834
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:58,520
I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

835
00:58:58,616 --> 00:59:00,609
She does me credit, don't she?

836
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:03,240
What are you doin' here?

837
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:07,791
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

838
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:11,669
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

839
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:14,044
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

840
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,047
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

841
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:24,425
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

842
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,263
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

843
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:31,691
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

844
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:35,562
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

845
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:37,657
What did he come for?

846
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:38,940
Say your vowels.

847
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:41,075
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

848
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:42,443
If you know them, say them.

849
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:45,624
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

850
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:48,869
A, E, l, O, U.

851
00:59:49,338 --> 00:59:52,256
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

852
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,177
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

853
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:58,382
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

854
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:01,677
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

855
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:03,311
Drilling is what she needs.

856
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,803
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

857
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,935
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

858
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:10,225
Of course.

859
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:12,237
Say '"A.'"

860
01:00:12,405 --> 01:00:14,564
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

861
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:26,128
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

862
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:30,750
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

863

'"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins

01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:44,032
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

909
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,074
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

910
01:04:47,165 --> 01:04:49,407
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

911
01:04:53,505 --> 01:04:55,213
Now, you see that flame?

912
01:04:55,507 --> 01:04:59,007
Every time you pronounce the letter '"H'"
correctly the flame will waver...

913
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:02,380
...and every time you drop your '"H'"
the flame will remain stationary.

914
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:04,181
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

915
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,141
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

916
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:09,893
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

917

924
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:35,707
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.

925
01:05:36,427 --> 01:05:39,049
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

926

Go on, go on.

927

Does the same thing hold true in lndia?

928
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:59,283
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

929
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:03,414
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like '"hever'" instead of '"ever'"?

930
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,889
The girl, Higgins!

931
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:29,182
Go on. Go on.

Kind of you. It's like '"cup of tea.'"

947

Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, '"cup of tea.'"

No. '"A cup of tea.'"

It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

Oh, no.

957

Can't you hear the difference?

958
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:07,124
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

959
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:09,835
And then say '"cup.'"

By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

963
01:08:22,192 --> 01:08:25,442
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

964
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:27,438
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.

965
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:32,324
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

My mother's box at Ascot.

1065
01:16:16,628 --> 01:16:20,164
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.

1066
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:25,552
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1067
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:28,509
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

1068
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,225
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1069
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,350
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1070
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:35,439
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1071
01:16:35,774 --> 01:16:37,732
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1072
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:39,099
Whitely's, of course.

1073
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,274
How do you know that?

1074
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:41,774
Common knowledge.

1075
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,781
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1076
01:16:43,867 --> 01:16:48,161
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

1077
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,071
We'll buy something simple and modest...

1078
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,455
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

1079
01:16:53,544 --> 01:16:55,703
Perhaps with a bow.

1080
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:58,839
Yes. That's just right.

1081
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:05,552
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.

1082
01:17:05,641 --> 01:17:07,929
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

1083
01:17:08,018 --> 01:17:10,592
You must put down your books
and go to bed.

1084
01:17:10,688 --> 01:17:13,642
'"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed

1085
01:17:13,816 --> 01:17:17,316
'"My head's too light to try to set it down

1086

1087

1100
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,783
It's after three now.

1101
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:42,242
Don't you agree now?

1102
01:18:42,622 --> 01:18:45,457
She ought to be in bed!

1103
01:18:47,377 --> 01:18:50,414
'"l could have danced all night

It's all been grand, dear.

1116
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:51,070
But now it's time to sleep!

How nice you look.

1154

What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.
