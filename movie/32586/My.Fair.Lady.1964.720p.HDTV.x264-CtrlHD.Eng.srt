00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,870
Freddy, go and find a cab.

3
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,670
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

4
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,100
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

5
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,770
All right, I'll get one.

6
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,670
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

7
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm so sorry.

8
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,090
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

9
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,640
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

10
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,560
He's your son, is he?

11
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,930
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

12
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,970
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

13
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,980
Go about your business, my girl.

14
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,860
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

15
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,030
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

16
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,740
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

17
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

18
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,790
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

19
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,670
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

20
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

21
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,880
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

22
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,460
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

23
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

24
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,230
Thank you, sir.

25
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,520
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

26
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,570
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

27
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,500
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

28
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,670
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

29
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,510
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

30
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,750
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

31
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,430
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

32
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,050
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

33
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,970
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

34
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,050
Who's doing all that shouting?

35
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,820
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

36
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

37
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,650
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

38
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,610
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

39
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,530
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

40
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,530
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

41
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,960
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

42
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,530
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

43
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,550
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

44
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,590
I can.

45
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,730
'"l say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl.'"

46
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,520
Oh, it's cause I called him '"Capt'n.'"

47
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,360
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

48
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,870
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

49
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,070
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

50
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,080
...until I ask you.

51
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,540
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

52
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,710
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

53
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,790
How are all your people down at Selsey?

54
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,370
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

55
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,010
Never mind, they do.

56
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,550
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

57
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,890
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

58
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,230
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

59
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,060
Live where you like but stop that noise!

60
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,690
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

61
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,660
I'm a good girl, I am.

62
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,610
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

63
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,450
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

64
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,710
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

65
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,880
Madam, it's stopped raining.

66
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,450
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

67
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,290
Isn't that where you live?

68
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,090
What impertinence!

69
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,090
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

70
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,010
Cheltenham, Harrow...

71
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,020
...Cambridge and...

72
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,150
...lndia?

73
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,430
Quite right.

74
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,110
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

75
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,030
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

76
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,240
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

77
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,660
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

78
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,460
How do you do it, may I ask?

79
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,420
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

80
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,970
Anyone can spot an lrishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

81
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,180
...but I can place a man within six miles.

82
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,130
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

83
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,010
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

84
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,980
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

85
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,400
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

86
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,480
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

87
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,440
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

88
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,110
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

89
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,170
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

90
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,790
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

91
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,670
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

92
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,420
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

93
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,590
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

94
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,840
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

95

'"Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters

...that'll keep her in the gutter
till the end of her days?

143
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,530
In six months I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

144
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I could get her a job as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

145
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,620
...which requires better English.

Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf!

of these columns!

You incarnate insult
to the English language!

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,640
Anything's possible.
I, myself, am a student of lndian dialects.

153
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,230
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

154
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,480
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?

155
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.

156
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,320
I came from lndia to meet you!

157
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,660
I was going to lndia to meet you!

158
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,910
-Where are you staying?
-At the Carleton.

159
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,840
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.

160
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,710
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

161
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Indian dialects have always fascinated me.

162
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,720
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.

163
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,760
Liar!

164
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,220
You said you could change half a crown.

165
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,850
You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought!

166
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,390
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket
for a sixpence!

167
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,150
A reminder.

168
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,910
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,990
Indian dialects?

170
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,410
No fewer than 147 distinct languages
are recorded as vernacular in lndia.

171
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,010
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

172
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,760
Would you be lookin'
for a good butler, Eliza?

173
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,520
Well, you won't do.

It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,400
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

228
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,190
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

229
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,320
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

230
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,570
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

231
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,450
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Life!

233
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,340
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

234
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,050
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

235
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,130
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

236
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,840
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

237
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,560
I give 'er all that.

238
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,230
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

239
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,610
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

240
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,850
...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

241
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,150

But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...

242
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,950
...you better have a good story.

243
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,780
Leave that to me, my boy.

244

-Good mornin', George.
-Not a brass farthin'.

245

Why, Liza, what a surprise.

248
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,730
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me.

249
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,080
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.

250
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,000
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

251
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,950
Eliza, what a surprise.

252
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,610
Not a brass farthin'.

253
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,990
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

254
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,450

255

...and let you pass 'em on
to a bloody pubkeeper.

256

to your stepmother...

257

...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

258
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,930
Stepmother, indeed!

259
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,260
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

260
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,430
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

261
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,480
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

262
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,730
Come on.

263

to go 'ome on.

265
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,210
But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

266
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

267
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,220

...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

271
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,790
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

272
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,090
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

273
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,340
...which requires better English.

of these columns!

How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

278
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,860
I believe I counted 24.

279
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,070
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

280
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,290
Listen to them one at a time.

281

My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

One moment, please.

286
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,580
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

287
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,380
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

288
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,250
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

289
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,970
Could you tell me what it's about?

290
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,850
It's business of a personal nature.

291
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,390
One moment, please.

292
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,660
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

293
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,280
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

294
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,570
A young woman?

295
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,750
What does she want?

296
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,590
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

297
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,710
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

298
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,790
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

299
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,670
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

300
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

301
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,010
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

302
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,020
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

303
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,280
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

304
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,780
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

305
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,830
This is the young woman, sir.

306
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,190
Good mornin', my good man.

307
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,200
Might I 'ave a word with you?

308
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,780
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

309
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,130
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

310
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,130
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

311
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,840
Be off with you. I don't want you.

312
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,100
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

313
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,060
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

314
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,180
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

315
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,430
...what you came in?

316
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh, we are proud.

317
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,520
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

318
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,690
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

319
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,530
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

320
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,080
Good enough for what?

321
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,900
Good enough for you.

322
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,870
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

323
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,500
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

324
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,620
Well!

325
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,960
And what do you expect me to say?

326
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,260
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

327
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,050
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

328
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,760
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

329
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,260
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

330
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,400
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

331
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,400
What do you want, my girl?

332
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,360
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

333
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,290
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

334
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,120
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

335
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,490
He said 'e could teach me.

336
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,660
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

337
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,000
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

338
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,540
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

339
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,840
How much?

340
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,020
Now you're talkin'.

341
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,770
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

342
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,980
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

343
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,770
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

344
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,060
Sit down.

345
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,400
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

346
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,570
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

347
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,490
What's your name?

348
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,530
Eliza Doolittle.

349
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,660
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

350
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,130
I don't mind if I do.

351
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,800
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

352
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,510
Oh, I know what's right.

353
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,470
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

354
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,470
...from a real French gentleman.

355
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,890
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

356
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,820
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

357
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,270
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

358
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,490
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

359
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,830
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

360
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,870
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

361
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,040
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

362
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,300
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

363
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,600
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

364
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,060
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

365
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,770
But I ain't got 60 pounds!

366
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,640
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

367
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,070
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

368
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,320
Sit down!

369
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,820
Anybody'd think you was my father!

370
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,570
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

371
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,370
Here.

372
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,700
What's this for?

373
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,580
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

374
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,640
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

375
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,300
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

376
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,220
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

377
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,930
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

378
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,100
Higgins, I'm interested.

379
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,560
What about your boast...

380
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,520
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

381
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,450
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

382
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,660
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

383
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,580
I'll even pay for the lessons.

384
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,370
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

385
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,750
It's almost irresistible.

386
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,760
She's so deliciously low.

387
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,390
So horribly dirty.

388
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,050
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

389
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,090
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

390
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,020
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

391
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,530
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

392
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,650
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

393
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,360
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

394
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,450
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

395
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm a good girl, I am.

396
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,910
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

397
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,790
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

398
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,290
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

399
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,840
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

400
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,760
I'll call the police, I will.

401
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,480
I've got no place to put her.

402
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,520
Well, put her in the dustbin.

403
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,470
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

404
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,140
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

405
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,730
You can't walk over everybody like this.

406
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,520
I?

407
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,120
Walk over everybody?

408
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,370
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

409
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,630
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

410
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,300
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

411
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,830
...or yours.

412
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,010
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

413
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,800
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

414
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,060
Why not?

415
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,020
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

416
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,890
What about her parents?
She may be married.

417
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,350
Garn!

418
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,780
There. As the girl
very properly says, '"garn! '"

419
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,230
Who'd marry me?

420
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,450
By George, Eliza...

421
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,660
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

422
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,420
...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

423
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,210
I'm goin'.

424
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,050
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

425
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,310
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

426
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,600
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.

427
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,180
Go home to your parents, girl.

428
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,020
I ain't got no parents.

429
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,140
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

430
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,650
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

431
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,190
What's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?

432
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,860
Do be sensible, sir.

433
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,650
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

434
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,320
She'll drink if you give her money.

435
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,160
You are a brute! It's a lie!

436
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,740
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

437
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,920
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

438
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,210
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

439
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,420
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

440
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,720
Well, have you, Eliza?

441
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,130
I got me feelings same as anyone else.

442
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,510
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

443
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,010
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

444
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,930
You must look ahead a little, sir.

445
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,280
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

446
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,690
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

447
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,320
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

448
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,740
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

449
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,150
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

450
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,160
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

451
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,580
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

452
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,710
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

453
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,710
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

454
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,180
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

455
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,390
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

456
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,350
Pledge of good faith.

457
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,570
I'll take one half.

458
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,150
And you take the other.

459
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,700
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

460
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,790
You'll live on them, eh?

461
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,780
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

462
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,380
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

463
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,090
...and gold and diamonds.

464
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,220
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

465
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,880
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

466
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,980
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

467
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,610
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

468
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,860
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

469
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,950
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

470
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,870
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

471
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,260
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

472
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,800
But if you are naughty and idle...

473
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,720
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

474
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,840
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

475
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,020
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

476
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,770
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

477
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,940
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

478
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,360
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

479
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,450
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

480
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,910
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

481
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,210
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

482
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,470
If you refuse this offer...

483
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,500
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

484
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,550
...and the angels will weep for you!

485
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,030
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

486
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,190
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

487
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,740
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

488
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,740
Come with me.

489
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,580
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

490
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,570
You're a great bully, you are!

491
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,910
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

492
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,710
Don't answer back, girl.

493
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,660
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

494
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,090
In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

495
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,930
...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

496
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,680
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

497
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,100
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

498
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,860
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

499
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,740
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

500
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,780
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

501
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
It's too good for the likes o' me.

502
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,080
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

503
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,250
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

504
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,260
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

505
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,400
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

506
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,190
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

507
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,400
Not me!

508
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,700
I shall catch me death.

509
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,490
Come along now.

510
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,250
Come along.

511
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,420
Take your clothes off.

512
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,390
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

513
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,840
Here, come on. Help me take these--

514
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
Take your hands off me!

515
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,420
I'm a good girl, I am!

516
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,800
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

517
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,810
Get your hands off me!

518
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,610
I'm a good girl, I am!

519
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,340
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

520
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,340
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.

521
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,380
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

522
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,140
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

523
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,230
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

524
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,770
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

525
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,060
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

526
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,150
Yes, very frequently.

527
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,660
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

528
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,030
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

529
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,370
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

530
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,750
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

531
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,420
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

532
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,670
Well, after all, Pickering....

533
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,890
'"l'm an ordinary man

534

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,130
Well, Alfie, there's nothin' else to do.
I guess it's back to work.

611
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,920
Work! Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

612
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,890
Look at all these poor blighters down here.

613
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,980
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise.

614
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,240
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.

615
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,240
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.

616
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,240
How do you think you'll do that?

617
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,450
How? Same as always.

618
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,040
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

619

657

The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.

658
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,830
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

659
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,300
Her former residence!

660
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,130
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

661
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,180
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

662
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,550
What are you talkin' about?

663
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,920
Your daughter, Eliza.

664
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,470
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

665
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,980
What about Eliza?

666
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,030
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.

667
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,400
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

668
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,490
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

669
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,910
An' ain't been home for three days.

670
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,860
Go on.

671
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,160
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.

672
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,460
She wants her things sent over...

673
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,630
...to 27A Wimpole Street...

674
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,040
...care of Professor Higgins.

675
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,460
An' what things does she want?

676
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,100
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

677
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,720
But she says:

678
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,520
'"Never mind about sending any clothes.'"

679
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,910
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

680
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,620
We're in for a booze-up.

681
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,660
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,110
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

704
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,900
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

705
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,280
Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

707

You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

708
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,540
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

709
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,130
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

710
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,420
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

711
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,590
Throw it away.

712
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,180
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

713
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,180
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

714
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,400
If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

715
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,530
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

716
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,860
I say!

717
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,030
Well, send the blackguard up.

718
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,120
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

719
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,870
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

720
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,330
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

721
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,920
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

722
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,590
Doolittle, sir.

723

-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

724
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,300
Where?

725
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,730
Good morning, Governor.

726
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,190
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

727
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,740
Brought up in Houndslow.

728
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,370
Mother Welsh, I should think.

729
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,950
What is it you want, Doolittle?

730
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,580
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

731
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,160
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

732
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,880
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

733
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,590
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

734
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,790
What?

735
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:20,300
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

736
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,190
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

737
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,390
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

738
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,820
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

739
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,950
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

740
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,490
You sent her here on purpose!

741
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,910
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

742
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,240
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

743
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,710
...a plot to extort money by threats.

744
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,750
I shall telephone the police.

745
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

746
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,970
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

747
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,210
Well, what else did you come for?

748
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,090
What would a bloke come for?

749
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,390
Be 'uman, Governor.

750
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,440
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

751
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,230
So help me, Governor, I never did.

752
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,740
How did you know she was here?

753
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,700
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

754
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,660
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

755
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,710
I'm waiting to tell ya!

756
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,470
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

757
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,590
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

758
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,800
'"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.'"

759
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,050
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

760
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,930
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

761
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,520
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

762
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,320
She said she didn't want no clothes.

763
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,610
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

764
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,830
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

765
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,660
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

766
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,450
Mrs. Pearce!

767
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,330
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

768
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,840
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

769
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,470
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

770
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,060
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

771
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,850
I think so indeed, sir!

772
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,550
Here, Governor.

773
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,900
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

774
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,610
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

775
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,620
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

776
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,450
All I ask is my rights as a father.

777
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,210
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

778
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,800
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

779
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,920
So...

780
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,960
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

781
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,310
I think you should know, Doolittle...

782
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,560
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

783
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,770
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

784
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,110
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

785
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,940
Have you no morals, man?

786
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,030
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

787
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,330
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

788
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,920
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

789
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,290
Why not?

790
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,710
Look at it my way. What am l?

791
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,800
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

792
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,930
Think what that means to a man.

793
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,720
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

794
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,270
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

795
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,980
'"You're undeservin', so you can't have it.'"

796
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,160
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

797
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,740
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

798
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,330
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

799
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,800
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

800
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:00,840
...a lot more.

801
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,130
I'm playin' straight with you.

802
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,920
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

803
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,480
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

804
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,150
But will you take advantage of...

1
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:14,950
a man's nature...

2
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,900
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

3
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,700
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

4
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,080
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

5
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:32,340
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

6
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,340
And I leave it to you.

7
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,770
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

8
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:45,270
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

9
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,440
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

10
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,570
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

11
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,150
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

12
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,330
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

13
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,280
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

14
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,040
You couldn't spend it better.

15
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,880
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

16
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,460
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

17
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,260
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

18
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,880
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

19
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:17,350
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

20
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,770
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

21
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,930
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

22
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:26,440
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

23
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,150
Who told you that, Governor?

24
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,070
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

25
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,530
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

26
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,460
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

27
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,920
Are you sure you won't have ten?

28
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:45,290
No. No, perhaps another time.

29
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,510
I beg your pardon, miss.

30
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,350
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

31
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,090
Blimey, it's Eliza.

32
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,970
I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

33
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,050
She does me credit, don't she?

34
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,690
What are you doin' here?

35
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,240
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

36
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,110
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

37
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,490
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

38
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,490
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

39
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:21,870
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

40
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,710
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

41
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,140
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

42
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,010
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

43
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,100
What did he come for?

44
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,390
Say your vowels.

45
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,520
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

46
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,890
If you know them, say them.

47
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,070
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

48
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,310
A, E, l, O, U.

49
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,700
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

50
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,620
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

51
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,830
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

52
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,120
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

53
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,760
Drilling is what she needs.

54
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,250
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

55
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,380
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

56
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,670
Of course.

57
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,680
Say '"A.'"

58
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,010
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

59
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:23,570
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

60
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,200
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

61
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,170
'"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins

Now for your '"H's.'"

105

Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

106
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,480
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

107
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:44,520
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

108
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,850
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

109
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,660
Now, you see that flame?

110
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,450
Every time you pronounce the letter '"H'"
correctly the flame will waver...

111
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,830
...and every time you drop your '"H'"
the flame will remain stationary.

112
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,630
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

113
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,590
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

114
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:07,340
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

115
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,970
'"ln Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,890

Oh, no, no!

121
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,870
Have you no ear at all?

122
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,150
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.

123
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,490
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

124
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,420
Go on, go on.

125
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,550
Does the same thing hold true in lndia?

126
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,730
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

127
01:05:56,810 --> 01:06:00,860
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like '"hever'" instead of '"ever'"?

128
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,330
The girl, Higgins!

129
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,630
Go on. Go on.

How kind of you to let me come.

143

How kind of you to let me come.

144

Kind of you. It's like '"cup of tea.'"

145
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:30,420
Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, '"cup of tea.'"

146

Cuppatea.

147

No. '"A cup of tea.'"

148
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,250
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

149
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:43,260
First rate. And those strawberry tarts
are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

150
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,220
Try it again.

154
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,640
Oh, no.

155
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,730
Can't you hear the difference?

156
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:04,570
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

157
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,280
And then say '"cup.'"

158
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,040
Then say '"of.'"

159

Then say '"cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of.'"

160
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,510
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

161
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,890
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

162
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,880
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.

163
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:29,770
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

Perhaps the poem is
a little too difficult for the girl.

Just think what you're dealing with.

It's the greatest possession we have.

Do you know what it might have been?

259

I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?

260
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,140
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.

-Yes, of course.

No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

265
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,950
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

266
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,670
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

267
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,800
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

268
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,880
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

269
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,180
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

270
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,540
Whitely's, of course.

271
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,720
How do you know that?

272
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,220
Common knowledge.

273
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,230
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

274
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:45,610
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

275
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,520
We'll buy something simple and modest...

276
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,900
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

277
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:53,150
Perhaps with a bow.

278
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,280
Yes. That's just right.

279
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:03,000
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.

280
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,370
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

281
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,040
You must put down your books
and go to bed.

282
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:11,090
'"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed

283

It's after three now.

299
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,690
Don't you agree now?

300
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,900
She ought to be in bed!

Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

350
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,880
Hello, Mother.

351
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:52,510
How nice you look.

352
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,970
What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

353
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,560
I can't. I'm here on business.

354
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,480
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

355
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:03,020
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

356
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:04,900
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

357
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:07,520
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

358
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,110
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

359
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,030
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

360
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,570
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

361
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:19,750
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

362
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:23,160
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

363
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,710
Common flower girl?

364
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,840
I taught her how to speak properly.

365
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,210
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

366
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,720
She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

367
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,970
'"Fine day! '" and '"How do you do?'"
Not let herself go on.

368
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,100
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

369
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,390
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

370
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,520
She's got to talk about something.

371
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,800
Where is the girl now?

372
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:47,180
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

373
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,190
I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

374
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:56,070
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

375
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,780
You know my son, Henry.

376
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:00,120
How do you do?

377
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:03,080
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.

378
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,660
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

379
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:11,120
Where the devil can they be?

380
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,290
Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

381
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,660
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

382
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,080
My dear Miss Doolittle.

383
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,880
How kind of you to let me come.

384
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,460
Delighted, my dear.

385
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,420
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?

386
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,390
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?

387
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,390
How do you do?

388
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,390
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?

389
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,970
How do you do?

390
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:12,100
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

391
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,810
How do you do?

392
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,730
How do you do?

393
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,770
Miss Doolittle.

394
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:24,200
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

395
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,120
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

396
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,450
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

397
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,500
Will it rain, do you think?

398
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,880
'"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain.'"

399
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:54,510
'"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.'"

400
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,350
How awfully funny.

401
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,970
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

402
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,350
Smashing.

403
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,110
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

404
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:08,980
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

405
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,230
They bring on so much influenza.

406
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:14,080
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

407
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,490
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

408
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,830
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

409
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,330
Done her in?

410
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,670
Yes, Lord love you.

411
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:30,170
Why should she die of influenza...

412
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:34,210
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

413
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:36,680
Fairly blue with it she was.

414
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:39,220
They all thought she was dead.

415
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:43,440
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

416
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,780
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

417
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,530
Dear me!

418
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:00,040
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

419
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,030
...have to die of influenza?

420
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:07,040
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

421
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:11,960
Somebody pinched it.

422
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,010
And what I say is:

423
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:18,170
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

424
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,970
Done her in? '"Done her in,'" did you say?

425
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,340
Whatever does it mean?

426
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,060
That's the new small talk.
'"To do somebody in'" means to kill them.

427
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:32,820
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

428
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,680
Do I not?

429
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:39,810
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

430
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,650
But it can't have been right
for your father...

431
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:45,580
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

432
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,620
It might have killed her.

433
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:51,490
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

434
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:57,000
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

435
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,500
Do you mean that he drank?

436
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:02,430
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

437
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,350
Here, what are you sniggering at?

438
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,140
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

439
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,020
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

440
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,270
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

441
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,780
Not at all, my dear.

442
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,950
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

443
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,490
I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

444
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,410
...but come, my dear.

445
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:38,460
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

446
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,670
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

447
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,380
That's very kind of you.

448
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,580
His name is Dover.

449
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,130
Come along.

450
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,510
'"There they are again

451
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,220
'"Lining up to run

452
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,390
'"Now they're holding steady

453
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,770
'"They are ready for it. Look!

454
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:00,060
'"lt has begun'"

455
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,780
Come on. Come on, Dover.

456
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,740
Come on.

457
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,660
Come on, Dover!

458
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:12,820
Come on!

459
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:21,330
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

460
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,220
Oh, my dear.

461
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:48,060
You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

462
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:49,690
Don't you think she's ready for it?

463
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,150
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

464
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,480
Her language may need
a little refining, but--

465
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:58,190
Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

466
01:31:58,290 --> 01:31:59,950
...then you must be potty about her.

467
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,110
I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

468
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,780
...or this poor girl through any more.

469
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,410
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

470
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,950
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

471
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:13,910
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

472
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:18,630
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

473
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,000
Here's the car.

474
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,250
Good evening, sir.

475
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:45,010
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.

476
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,170
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

477
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:08,990
'"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon

478
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,030
'"She completely done me in

479
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:16,910
'"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon

480
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:22,130
'"When she told about her father
and the gin

481
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,790
'"And I never saw a more enchanting farce

482
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:32,470
'"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--''"

483
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,220
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?

484
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,130
Whom shall I say is calling?

485
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:40,510
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

486
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:43,560
...tell her I'm the chap
who was '"sniggering'" at her.

487
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:44,640
Yes, sir.

488
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:46,640
And will you give her these?

489
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,310
Wouldn't you like to come in?

490
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,530
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

491
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:54,150
No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

492
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:07,460
'"l have often walked
down this street before

493
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:13,170
'"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before

494
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:18,880
'"All at once am I several stories high

495
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,180
'"Knowing I'm on the street where you live

496
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,440
'"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?

497
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:36,110
'"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?

498
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:41,860
'"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?

499
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:47,320
'"No, it's just on the street where you live

500
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,370
'"And, oh, the towering feeling

501
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:58,710
'"Just to know somehow you are near

502
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:04,970
'"The overpowering feeling

503
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,180
'"That any second you may suddenly appear

504
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:16,520
'"People stop and stare,

505
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:22,190

that I would rather be

506
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:26,490
'"Let the time go by

507
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:30,620
'"l won't care if I

508
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:36,030
'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

509
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,290
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

510
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:48,550
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

511
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,350
But why? She was unbelievable.

512
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:53,600
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

513
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,010
Tell her that I'll wait.

514
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,510
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

515
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:01,140
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

516
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,740
'"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

517
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:20,740
'"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

518
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,790

519
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:29,790
'"l won't care if I

520
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:35,420
'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

521
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:48,230
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

522
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,360
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

523
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:54,400
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

524
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:57,200
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

525
01:37:57,290 --> 01:38:00,820
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

526
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:03,160
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am l.

527
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,160
This experiment is over.

528
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:09,580
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

529
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,960
You understand, Higgins? It's over.

530
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,510
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

531
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,220
...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

532
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,550
...it'll be on your head alone.

533
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,890
Eliza can do anything.

534
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,770
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

535
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:27,730
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

536
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:30,480
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

537
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:34,820
Think of how agonizing it would be.

538
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,570
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

539
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,230
You could always rejoin your regiment.

540
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,150
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

541
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,280
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

542
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,450
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

543
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:48,540
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

544
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,580
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

545
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,000
I'm not nervous.

546
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:55,540
-Where is it?
-On the piano.

547
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,420
The car's here, sir.

548
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,170
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

549
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,880
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

550
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,050
I warned you about these French designers.

551
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:09,470
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

552
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,890
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

553
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:22,450
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

554
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,690
Well, we shall see.

555
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:26,580
Suppose she doesn't?

556
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,370
I lose my bet.

557
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:33,200
There's one thing I can't stand about you,
your confounded complacency.

558
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:35,330
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

559
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:38,920
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

560
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:44,340
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

561
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,050
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

562
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:49,840
What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

563
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:53,430
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

564
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,730
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

565
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:01,560
It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

566
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:03,310
...and soul from soul.

567
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:06,410
Oh, she matters immensely.

568
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:31,000
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

569
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,260
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

570
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:35,260
Don't you think so, Higgins?

571
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:40,650
Not bad. Not bad at all.

572
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,770
Maestro! Maestro!

573
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:15,190
Don't you remember me?

574
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,900
No. Who the devil are you?

575
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:20,440
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

576
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:23,060
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

577
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,200
I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

578
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:28,200
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

579
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:30,030
Why don't you have your hair cut?

580
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,660
I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

581
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:35,830
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

582
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,750
Where did you get these old coins?

583
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,830
These are decorations for languages.

584
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,670
The Queen of Transylvania is here.

585
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,880
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

586
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,890
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

587
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:50,050
No imposter can escape my detection.

588
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:52,130
Professor Karpathy.

589
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:55,850
The Greek ambassador.

590
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:57,730
Greek, my foot!

591
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,600
He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

592
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:03,100
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

593
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:07,240
He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

594
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,570
...without betraying his origin.

595
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:13,410
I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

596
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:16,780
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

597
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,510
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

598
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,770
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

599
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:49,320
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

600
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:11,330
The Count and Countess Demereau.

601
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:14,540
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

602
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:17,590
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

603
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,840
Lord and Lady Clanders.

604
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,390
Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

605
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:28,310
Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.

606
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:30,730
Professor Higgins.

607
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,310
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle.

608
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,680
How do you do?

609
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:37,070
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.

610
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:41,830
What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.

611
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:43,320
Well, who is she?

612
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,410
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

613
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,080
Professor Higgins.

614
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:53,250
Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

615
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:55,750
So she has. A sort of garden.

616
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:28,070
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

617
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,330
-Sort of, you know, '"imposterologist.'"
-I beg you pardon?

618
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,620
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

619
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,330
Find out who she is.

620
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:37,830
With pleasure.

621
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,790
The whole situation is highly explosive.

622
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,170
Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

623
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:52,850
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

624
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,140
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

625
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:06,820
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

626
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:10,280
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

627
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,860
Charming. Quite charming.

628
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,000
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

629
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:41,130
Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

1
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:37,930
Eliza.

2
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,070
Absolutely fantastic.

3
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:55,000
A lot of tomfoolery.

4
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,120
It was an immense achievement.

5
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,670
Well, Mr. Higgins?

6
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:02,250
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

7
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:06,000
Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

8
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:10,170
Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

9
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:12,050
Not during the whole evening?

10
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,800
Not when I saw we were going to win.

11
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:15,890
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

12
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,640
It was an immense achievement.

13
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:20,810
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

14
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,230
Absolutely fantastic.

15
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,860
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

16
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,900
Higgins, I salute you.

17
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,740
The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

18
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:31,830
'"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

19
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:34,860

I doubted you'd do it

That succeed you did

22

24

35

44
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:01,740
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

45
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:04,070
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.

46
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,400
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

47
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,580
Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks.

48

'"That blackguard

-Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

I think I'll turn in, too. Good night.
It's been a great occasion.

Good night, Pickering.

87
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:18,960
Mrs. Pearce?

88
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:24,100
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

89
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,560
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.

90
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:18,890
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.

91
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:21,100
I'll leave my head behind
one of these days.

92
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:23,810
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

93
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:28,240
Here are your slippers!

94
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:37,320
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

95
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,030
What on earth? What's the matter?

96
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:41,790
Is anything wrong?

97
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,870
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't l?

98
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:47,840
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?

99
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:52,040
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!

100
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:53,800
Why did you throw the slippers at me?

101
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:57,340
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

102
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:59,590
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

103
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:03,470
You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

104
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:06,140
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

105
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,980
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

106
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:13,650
Sit down and be quiet!

107
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:16,360
What's to become of me?

108
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:21,450
How do I know what's to become of you?

109
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:22,740
What does it matter?

110
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:25,500
You don't care. I know you don't care.

111
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:28,080
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

112
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:30,040
Not as much as them slippers.

113
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:31,210
Those slippers!

114
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,960
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

115
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,310
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

116
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:44,310
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

117
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:45,220
No.

118
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:48,470
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

119
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:49,600
No.

120
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:52,980
Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

121
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:54,810
No.

122
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,810
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

123
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:00,690
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

124
02:00:01,370 --> 02:00:03,740
Would you have a chocolate?

125
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,570
No, thank you.

126
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:12,750
Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

127
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,710
Nothing more to worry about.

128
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,670
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

129
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:21,710
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

130
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:24,920
Why? ln heaven's name, why?

131
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:29,510
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

132
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:32,140
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

133
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:35,730
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

134
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:37,020
Go to bed and sleep it off.

135
02:00:37,110 --> 02:00:41,570
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

136
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:43,730
I heard your prayers.

137
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:45,650
'"Thank God it's all over.'"

138
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,490
Don't you thank God it's all over?

139
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:49,990
Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

140
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:53,200
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

141
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:56,670
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

142
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,370
And what's to become of me?

143
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:03,300
That's what's worrying you, is it?

144
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,880
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

145
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:11,380
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

146
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:16,770
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

147
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:19,770
You might marry, you know.

148
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:24,060
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

149
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:27,150
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

150
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:28,900
You're not bad-looking.

151
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,480
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

152
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,120
Not now, when you've been crying.

153
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:35,000
You look like the very devil, but...

154
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:39,540
...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

155
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,790
Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

156
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:47,660
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

157
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:55,970
I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

158
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:58,180
We were above that at Covent Garden.

159
02:01:58,270 --> 02:01:59,730
What do you mean?

160
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:02,470
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

161
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:06,350
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

162
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:09,110
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

163
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:12,230
...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

164
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,400
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

165
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:16,120
What else am I to do?

166
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,030
Oh, there are lots of things.

167
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,530
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

168
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:23,660
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

169
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,710
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

170
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:29,870
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

171
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:32,460
Come on now. You'll be all right.

172
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:36,800
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

173
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:40,430
I was looking for something. What was it?

174
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,710
Your slippers.

175
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:44,980
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

176
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,390
Before you go, sir.

177
02:02:52,150 --> 02:02:55,150
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

178
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,450
What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

179
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:00,530
Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

180
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:02,080
What may I take away with me?

181
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,570
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

182
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:06,330
Stealing?

183
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:10,700
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

184
02:03:10,790 --> 02:03:14,840
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

185
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:18,370
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

186
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:21,970
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

187
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:24,800
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

188
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:27,640
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

189
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:28,970
Stop, please.

190
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:34,220
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

191
02:03:35,070 --> 02:03:37,980
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

192
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:43,070
Hand them over! lf these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

193
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,730
...l'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

194
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:50,120
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

195
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:53,000
I don't want it now.

196
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:57,910
Don't you hit me!

197
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:01,590
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

198
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:04,340
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

199
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:08,010
I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

200
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:12,760
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

201
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:15,640
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

202
02:04:15,730 --> 02:04:18,300
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce
about the coffee...

203
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:19,980
...for it won't be done by me!

204
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:23,650
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

205
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:28,150
Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

206
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:32,400
...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

229
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:49,130
Don't you call me '"Miss Doolittle,'"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

230
02:07:51,050 --> 02:07:54,640

I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

303
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:08,810
Father?

304
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:14,410
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

305

Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

306
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:24,830
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

307
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:27,590
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

308
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:29,080
As if you didn't know.

309
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:33,170
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

310
02:14:33,390 --> 02:14:35,010
What's he done to you?

311
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:36,670
Ruined me, that's all.

312
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:40,600
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

313
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:42,390
And don't you defend him.

314
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:47,020
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford...

315
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:51,270
...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

316
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:56,360
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

317
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:57,990
...a common dustman?

318
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:01,450
Sounds like one of his jokes.

319
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:04,820
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

320
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:09,370
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

321
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:14,920
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

322
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:19,720
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

323
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:23,420
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

324
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:27,010
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

325
02:15:27,730 --> 02:15:29,800
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

326
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:33,510
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

327
02:15:34,150 --> 02:15:38,810
I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

328
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:42,860
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

329
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:45,160
-Church?
-Yeah, church.

330
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:48,070
The deepest cut of all.

331
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:51,780
Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

332
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:54,240
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

333
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:57,170
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

334
02:15:57,460 --> 02:16:00,830
If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

335
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:03,000
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

336
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:05,130
It's easy to say chuck it...

337
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:07,800
...but I 'aven't the nerve.

338
02:16:08,140 --> 02:16:10,760
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

339
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:13,520
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

340
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:16,940
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

341
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:19,020
Not my precious professor.

342
02:16:19,730 --> 02:16:21,640
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

343
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:28,230
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

344
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:30,860
That's all part of his plan...

345
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:33,400
...but you double-cross him.

346
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,160
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

347
02:16:38,750 --> 02:16:42,290
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

348
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:45,330
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

349
02:16:46,010 --> 02:16:48,080
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

350
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:52,300
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

No, thank you, Dad.

354

355

Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

You were there.

Did you bully her after I went to bed?

She threw the slippers at me.

I never gave her the slightest provocation.

445

The slippers came at my head
before I uttered a word.

446
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:09,370
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.

447
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:12,130
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

I'm dashed!

449

Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

450
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,420
Phone the police. What are they there for?

451
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:22,000
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

452

...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

453
02:24:24,310 --> 02:24:26,220
But why not? I want to find the girl.

454
02:24:26,310 --> 02:24:29,010
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.

455
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:31,940
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

456

I should say about 5 foot 7.

464
02:24:58,090 --> 02:25:02,040
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....

465
02:25:02,380 --> 02:25:04,130
-Brown.
-Brown.

466

Brown, brown, brown, yes.

469
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:18,680
No. This is her residence. 27A--

470

Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.

471
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:26,820
No.... She's no relation, no.

472
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,700
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?

473
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,620
I beg your pardon?

474
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:35,500
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor
of that question.

475
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:37,950
What the girl does here is our affair.

476
02:25:39,250 --> 02:25:42,700
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

477
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:44,830

on how marvelous they'd been.

562
02:30:53,130 --> 02:30:55,620
The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

563
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:57,500
...and what a bore it had all been.

564
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:00,840
This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

565
02:31:00,930 --> 02:31:03,170
I should have thrown the fire irons.

566
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:04,470
Who's that?

567
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:07,300
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

568
02:31:08,890 --> 02:31:10,270
Now, remember...

569
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:15,350
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

570
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,940
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

571
02:31:28,490 --> 02:31:29,410
You!

572
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:33,360
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

573
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:38,960
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

574
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:42,620
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

575
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:44,460
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

576
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:46,090
You've caused me enough trouble.

577
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:50,170
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

578
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:51,840
How did this baggage get here?

579
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:54,880
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

580
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:57,930
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

581
02:31:58,020 --> 02:32:00,010
I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

582
02:32:00,110 --> 02:32:03,890
...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

583
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,730
That's precisely what I mean.

584
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:07,400
I'll see her damned first.

585
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:10,610
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

586
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:15,150
It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

587
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,870
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

588
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:21,530
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

589
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:24,990
...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

590
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:31,210
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

591
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:35,130
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

592
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:37,010
...but how she is treated.

593
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:42,300
I'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

594
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:46,010
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

595
02:32:46,730 --> 02:32:48,850
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

596
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:52,230
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

597
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:58,580
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

598
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:01,490
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

599
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:04,070
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

600
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:05,990
I should be excommunicated.

601
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:08,200
I'll see him in the library.

602
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:11,630
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

603
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,540
...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

604
02:33:14,630 --> 02:33:18,840
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

605
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:48,700
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

606
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:52,210
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

607
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:54,290
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

608
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:57,410
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

609
02:33:57,510 --> 02:33:59,300
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

610
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:00,760
Then what are we talking about?

611
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:02,470
Well, about you, not about me.

612
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:05,260
If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

613
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:07,590
I can't change my nature or my manners.

614
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,520
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

615
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:14,380
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

616
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,760
I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

617
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:19,020
I see. The same to everybody.

618
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:22,240
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

619
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:25,770
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

620
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:29,650
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

621
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,940
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

622
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:37,460
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

623
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:39,500
I don't care how you treat me.

624
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:42,670
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

625
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:45,840
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over!

626
02:34:46,050 --> 02:34:47,920
Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

627
02:34:48,010 --> 02:34:50,130
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

628
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:54,430
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

629
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:57,440
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

630
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:59,930
I know you can. I told you, you could.

631
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,930
You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

632
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:08,570
...whether I could get along without you?

633
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:12,690
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

634
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:16,530
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

635
02:35:19,670 --> 02:35:23,880
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

636
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:27,080
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

637
02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:32,420
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

638
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:37,010
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

639
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:41,270
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

640
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:46,180
You are a devil!

641
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:49,640
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

642
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:52,190
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

643
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:54,110
What am I to come back for?

644
02:35:54,450 --> 02:35:56,520
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

645
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:59,370
You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

646
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:02,870
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

647
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,150
And live with my father?

648
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:06,790
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

649
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,620
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

650
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:13,920
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.

651
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:16,840
That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

652
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:19,170
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

653
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:22,350
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

654
02:36:22,430 --> 02:36:26,380
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

655
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:30,470
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

656
02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:33,310
I want a little kindness.

657
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:37,430
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

658
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:39,770
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

659
02:36:40,030 --> 02:36:45,030
What I done...what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

660
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:49,120
...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to...came...

661
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:51,950
...to care for you.

662
02:36:52,250 --> 02:36:54,040
Not to want you to make love to me...

663
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:57,210
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

664
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,960
...more friendly like.

665
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:03,420
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

666
02:37:04,050 --> 02:37:07,640
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

667
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:09,100
That's not the proper answer.

668
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:11,140
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

669
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:13,390
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

670
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:16,100
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

671
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:18,230
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

672
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:20,720
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

673
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:22,900
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

674
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:24,900
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

675
02:37:24,990 --> 02:37:27,740
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

676
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:30,990
If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

677
02:37:31,330 --> 02:37:34,160
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

678
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:35,960
I'm always in the wrong.

679
02:37:36,170 --> 02:37:38,410
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

680
02:37:38,500 --> 02:37:40,630
...to be trampled on and talked down.

681
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:44,250
I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

682
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:48,340
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

683
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:50,390
...even if he had the guts to try?

684
02:37:50,470 --> 02:37:54,220
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

685
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:57,350
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

686
02:37:57,440 --> 02:38:00,440
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

687
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:02,270
I'll go and be a teacher.

688
02:38:02,690 --> 02:38:04,680
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

689
02:38:04,780 --> 02:38:07,310
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

690
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:15,950
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

691
02:38:16,830 --> 02:38:20,490
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

692
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:23,030
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

693
02:38:23,130 --> 02:38:25,750
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!

694
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,290
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

695
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:35,510
That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

696
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:38,680
Now, I don't care for your bullyin'
an' your big talk.

697
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:41,850
'"What a fool I was

There's not an idea in your head or a word
