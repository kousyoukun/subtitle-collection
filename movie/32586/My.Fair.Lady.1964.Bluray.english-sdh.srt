But if you are naughty and idle,

you shall sleep in the back kitchen
amongst the black beetles

to other presumptuous flower girls.

926
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,941
- Yes, you better go, Mrs. Pearce.
- I think so indeed, sir.

927
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,192
Here, governor.

928
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:26,071
I've took a sort of a fancy
to you and...

929
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,865
[LAUGHS]

930
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,202
If you want the girl, well, I ain't so set
on having her back home again,

931
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,706
but what I might be
open to is an arrangement.

932
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,250
All I ask is my rights as a father.

933
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,171
You're the last man alive
to expect me to let her go for nothing.

934
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,549
Oh, I can see you're one
of the straight sort, governor.

935
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,677
So, what's a 5-pound note to you?

936
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,555
And what's Eliza to me?

937
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,223
I think you ought to know, Doolittle,

938
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,352
that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

939
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,270
Of course they are, governor.

940
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,981
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

941
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,276
Do you mean to say you'd sell
your daughter for 50 pounds?

942
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,986
Have you no morals, man?

943
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,449
No, no,
I can't afford them, governor.

944
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,785
Neither could you
if you was as poor as me.

945
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,411
Not that I mean any harm,
mind you.

946
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,456
But if Eliza is gonna have
a bit out of this,

947
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,875
why not me too, eh?

948
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,126
Why not?

949
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:25,798
Well, look at it my way.

950
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,967
What am I? I ask you, what am I?

951
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,595
I'm one of the undeserving poor,
that's what I am.

952
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,680
Now, think
what that means to a man.

953
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,060
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all of time.

954
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,562
If there's anything going
and I puts in for a bit of it,

955
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,855
it's always the same story.

956
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,817
"You're undeserving
so you can't have it."

957
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,028
But my needs is as great
as the most deserving widows

958
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,240
that ever got money out
of six different charities in one week

959
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,575
for the death of the same husband.

960
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,454
I don't need less than
a deserving man, I need more.

961
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,832
I don't eat less hearty than he does.

962
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,835
And I drink, oh, a lot more.

963
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:06,880
I'm playing straight with you.
I ain't pretending to be deserving.

964
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,133
No, I'm undeserving.

965
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,343
And I mean to go on
being undeserving.

966
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,262
I like it, and that's the truth.

967
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:17,307
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature

968
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,393
to do him out of the price
of his own daughter,

969
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:24,022
what he's brought up, fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow

970
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,566
till she's growed big enough

971
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,611
to be interesting
to you two gentlemen?

972
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:34,324
Well, is 5 pounds unreasonable?
I put it to you.

973
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,743
And I leave it to you.

974
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,458
You know, Pickering, if we took
this man in hand for three months,

975
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,460
he could choose
between a seat in the cabinet

976
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,254
and a popular pulpit in Wales.

977
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,964
We'd better give him a fiver.

978
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,133
He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

979
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,260
Oh, not me, governor.
So help me, I won't.

980
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,846
Just one good spree
for myself and the missus.

981
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:59,141
Giving pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

982
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,019
And satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been thrown away.

983
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,437
You couldn't spend it better.

984
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,273
Oh, this is irresistible.
Let's give him 10.

985
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,193
No, the missus wouldn't have the heart
to spend 10, governor.

986
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,986
Ten pounds is a lot of money.

987
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:14,907
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to happiness.

988
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:19,411
No, you give me what I ask, governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

989
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,581
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

990
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,625
Why don't you marry
that missus of yours, eh?

991
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,794
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

992
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,796
Who told you that, governor?

993
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,842
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally.

994
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,805
If we listen to this man
for another minute,

995
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,390
we shall have no convictions left.

996
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,227
- Five pounds, I think you said.
- Thank you, governor, thank you.

997
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,686
Are you sure you won't have 10?

998
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:48,524
- No, no, perhaps another time.
- I won't, I won't, I won't.

999
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,234
I beg your pardon, miss.

1000
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,070
ELIZA: I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

1001

Blimey, it's Eliza.

1002
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:57,741
Well, I never thought
she'd clean up so good-looking.

1003
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,785
She does me credit,
don't she, governor?

1004
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,371
Here, what you doing here?

1005
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,081
Now, now, you hold your tongue.

1006
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,334
And don't you give these gentlemen
none of your lip.

1007
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,253
If you have any trouble
with her, governor,

1008
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,837
give her a few licks of the strap.

1009
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,382
That's the way to improve her mind.

1010
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,008
Well, good morning, gentlemen.

1011

- Cheerio, Eliza.
- Mah!

There's a man for you.

A philosophical genius
of the first water.

1014
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:27,145
Mrs. Pearce,
write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford

1015
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,772
and tell him if he wants a lecturer

1016
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,816
to get in touch
with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,

1017
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,610
a common dustman, one of the most
original moralists in England.

1018
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,903
Yes, sir.

1019
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,989
Here, what did he come for?

1020
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,240
Say your vowels.

1021
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,200
I know my vowels.
I knew them before I come.

1022
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,535
If you know them, say them.

1023

That's what I been saying
for three days

and I won't say them no more.

1029
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,676
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

1030
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,344
There's no use explaining, Pickering.

1031
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,139
As a military man, you know that.
Drilling is what she needs.

Now, leave her alone or she'll be
turning to you for sympathy.

Very well, if you insist, but have
a little patience with her, Higgins.

[SINGING] When she mentioned
How her aunt bit off the spoon

And my heart went on a journey
To the moon

When she told about her father
And the gin

And I never saw
A more enchanting farce

- Is Miss Doolittle in?

No. No, thank you. I want to

Yes, sir.

I have often walked
Down this street before

But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

to teach this poor girl in six weeks?

a bishop, an ambassador.

It's absolutely impossible.

Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

I know you're a stubborn man,

And nothing
short of an order from the king

if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment whatever,

Remember Ascot.

Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

Oh, if anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

You could always
rejoin your regiment.

This is no time for flippancy,
Higgins.

1643

The way you've driven the girl
the last six weeks

1644
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:47,253
has exceeded
all bounds of common decency.

For God's sake,

Can't you settle somewhere?

Have some port.
It'll quieten your nerves.

- Tell Miss Doolittle.
- Yes.

1652

Tell Miss Doolittle indeed. I bet you
that damned gown doesn't fit.

I warned you
about these French designers.

1654

We should've gone to an English shop,
everyone would've been on our side.

1655

- Have a glass of port?
- No, thank you.

1656
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:23,873
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

Well, we shall see.

I can't stand about you,

that's your
confounded complacency.

At a moment like this,
with so much at stake,

1663
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:40,390
it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1664
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:45,728
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1665
01:39:46,188 --> 01:39:48,982
Oh, rubbish, Pickering.
Of course she matters.

1666
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,484
What do you think
I've been doing all these months?

1667
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,988
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being

1668
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:56,906
and change her
into a different human being

1669
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,367
by creating a new speech for her?

1670
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:00,827
It's filling up the deepest gap

1671
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:05,498
that separates class from class
and soul from soul.

1672
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:08,668
No, she matters immensely.

You might marry, you know.

You're really quite a pleasure

Now, you go to bed,
have a good night's rest,

02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:17,639
then get up
and have a look at yourself.

You won't feel so bad.

You don't have to marry

- What else am I to do?
- Well, there are lots of things.

1959

What about the old idea
of a florist shop?

1960
02:03:53,217 --> 02:03:56,136
Pickering would set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1961
02:03:56,345 --> 02:03:58,430
He paid for all those togs
you're wearing tonight.

1962
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:02,475
And that with the hire of the jewelry
will make a big hole in 200 pounds.

Oh, come on now.
You'll be all right.

Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:14,070
Your slippers.

1967
02:04:14,822 --> 02:04:18,491
Oh, yes, of course.
You shied them at me.

- Before you go, sir,
- Hm?

Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

What the devil use
would they be to Pickering?

1971
02:04:31,088 --> 02:04:32,797
Why do you bother about that
in the night?

1972
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:34,757
I want to know
what I may take away with me.

I don't wanna be
accused of stealing.

Stealing?

1975
02:04:40,139 --> 02:04:43,224
You shouldn't have said that, Eliza.
That shows a want of feeling.

1976
02:04:43,434 --> 02:04:47,437
I'm sorry. I'm a common ignorant girl.
In my station, I have to be careful.

1977
02:04:47,646 --> 02:04:50,648
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1978
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:53,860
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1979
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:57,447
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1980
02:04:57,656 --> 02:04:59,991
Except the jewelry, that's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1981
02:05:00,201 --> 02:05:01,451
Stop, please.

1982
02:05:03,913 --> 02:05:07,457
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1983
02:05:07,666 --> 02:05:10,043
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1984
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:13,546
Hand them over.

1985
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:15,548
If these belonged to me
and not the jeweler,

1986
02:05:15,758 --> 02:05:18,468
I'd ram them
down your ungrateful throat.

1987
02:05:18,677 --> 02:05:23,806
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1988
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:26,184
I don't want it now.

I've got a little of my own back anyhow.

02:16:56,666 --> 02:17:00,127
A year ago,
I hadn't a relation in the world

2150
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:02,254
except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

Now I've 50.

2152
02:17:03,798 --> 02:17:06,550
Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

2153
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:09,803
Oh, I have to live for others now,
not for myself.

2154
02:17:10,013 --> 02:17:11,931
Middle-class morality.

2155
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:15,392
Come on, Alfie. Another couple
of hours, we have to be at the church.

2156
02:17:15,602 --> 02:17:18,479
- Church?
- Yeah, church.

2157
02:17:18,688 --> 02:17:20,981
The deepest cut of all.

2158
02:17:21,191 --> 02:17:24,652
Well, why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

2159
02:17:24,861 --> 02:17:26,654
Your stepmother
wants to marry me.

2160
02:17:26,863 --> 02:17:29,782
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

2161
02:17:29,991 --> 02:17:33,244
Well, if that's the way you feel about it,
why don't you give the money back?

2162
02:17:33,453 --> 02:17:35,579
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

2163

but I haven't the nerve.

Yeah. That's what I am.

2167
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:49,510
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

2168
02:17:49,719 --> 02:17:52,096
Not my precious professor.

2169
02:17:52,305 --> 02:17:55,266
Oh, sent you back, has he?

2170
02:17:55,684 --> 02:17:58,269
First he shoves me
in the middle class,

2171
02:17:58,478 --> 02:18:01,230
then he chucks you out
for me to support you.

2172
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:03,732
That's all part of his plan.

2173
02:18:03,942 --> 02:18:06,360
But you double-cross him.

as if she were a thief
or a lost umbrella.

2301
02:25:57,081 --> 02:25:58,832
But why not? I want to find the girl.

2302
02:25:59,041 --> 02:26:01,877
She belongs to me.
I paid 5 pounds for her.

2303
02:26:02,086 --> 02:26:04,880
Quite right. Hello.
Scotland Yard, please.

2304
02:26:05,089 --> 02:26:06,548
Get me some coffee,
would you please?

2305
02:26:06,758 --> 02:26:07,966
- Yes, sir.
MAN: Who's there?

2306
02:26:08,176 --> 02:26:11,470
Scotland Yard? Yes, of course.
I beg your pardon, yes.

2307
02:26:11,679 --> 02:26:15,182
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
Hugh Pickering.

2308
02:26:15,391 --> 02:26:18,602
- 27A Wimpole Street.
- 27A Wimpole Street.

2309
02:26:18,811 --> 02:26:21,521
- I want to report a missing person.
- Male or female?

2310
02:26:21,731 --> 02:26:25,192
A Miss Eliza Doolittle, yeah.
About 21.

2311
02:26:25,401 --> 02:26:27,444
And her height?

2312
02:26:27,653 --> 02:26:30,697
- I should say about 5'7".
- What color eyes?

2313
02:26:30,907 --> 02:26:34,993
Her eyes? Oh, let me think now.
Her eyes, her eyes.

2314
02:26:35,203 --> 02:26:37,788
- Brown.
- Brown, yeah.

2315
02:26:37,997 --> 02:26:40,874
No, no, no. Her hair?

2316
02:26:41,083 --> 02:26:42,292
Oh, good Lord. Let me...

2317
02:26:42,502 --> 02:26:44,211
Well, sort of nondescript
neutral sort of...

2318
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:46,046
Brown, brown, brown.

2319
02:26:46,255 --> 02:26:48,757
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

2320
02:26:48,966 --> 02:26:50,342
No, no, no, this is her residence.

2321
02:26:50,551 --> 02:26:52,552
27A... Yeah.

2322
02:26:52,762 --> 02:26:55,764
About between 3 and 4 this morning,
I understand.

2323
02:26:55,973 --> 02:26:57,516
Yes. No, no, no.

2324
02:26:57,725 --> 02:26:59,518
Rela... No, she's no relation, no.

2325
02:26:59,727 --> 02:27:03,730
What? Well, just let's call her
a good friend, shall we?

2326
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:05,315
I beg your pardon?

2327
02:27:05,525 --> 02:27:08,318
Listen to me, my man,
I don't like the tenor of that question.

2328
02:27:08,528 --> 02:27:11,780
What the girl does here is our affair.

2329
02:27:11,989 --> 02:27:15,909
Your affair is to get her back
so that she can continue doing it.

2330
02:27:16,118 --> 02:27:17,828
Well, I'm dashed.

2331
02:27:20,164 --> 02:27:22,999
[SINGING] What, in all in heaven,
Can have prompted her to go?

2332
02:27:23,209 --> 02:27:26,002
After such a triumph at the ball?

2333
02:27:26,212 --> 02:27:28,797
What could have depressed her?
What could have possessed her?

2334
02:27:29,006 --> 02:27:32,551
I cannot understand
The wretch at all

2335
02:27:34,011 --> 02:27:36,805
Higgins, I have an old school chum
at the Home Office.

2336
02:27:37,014 --> 02:27:40,183
Perhaps he can help.
Think I'll give him a ring.

2337
02:27:40,393 --> 02:27:41,935
WOMAN [ON PHONE]:
Number, please.

2338
02:27:42,144 --> 02:27:44,312
Whitehall 72-double 4, please.

2339
02:27:44,522 --> 02:27:46,815
Whitehall 72-double 4.

2340
02:27:47,024 --> 02:27:49,526
[SINGING] Women are irrational
That's all there is to that

2341
02:27:49,735 --> 02:27:52,571
Their heads are full of cotton
Hay and rags

2342
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:55,699
They're nothing but exasperating
Irritating, vacillating

2343
02:27:55,908 --> 02:27:59,911
Calculating, agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags

2344
02:28:00,121 --> 02:28:01,204
MAN:
The Home Office here.

2345
02:28:01,414 --> 02:28:03,957
Oh, I want to speak
to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

2346
02:28:04,166 --> 02:28:07,586
- Would you hold on, sir?
- Brew... Yes, I'll wait.

2347
02:28:12,049 --> 02:28:13,508
Pickering,

2348
02:28:13,718 --> 02:28:16,636
why can't a woman
be more like a man?

2349
02:28:16,846 --> 02:28:18,305
I beg your pardon?

2350
02:28:18,514 --> 02:28:22,475
[SINGING] Yes, why can't a woman
Be more like a man?

2351
02:28:22,685 --> 02:28:25,604
Men are so honest
So thoroughly square

2352
02:28:25,813 --> 02:28:29,024
Eternally noble, historically fair

2353
02:28:29,233 --> 02:28:32,319
Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat

2354
02:28:32,528 --> 02:28:35,906
Well, why can't a woman
Be like that?

2355
02:28:36,365 --> 02:28:39,576
Why does everyone
Do what the others do?

2356
02:28:39,785 --> 02:28:42,579
Can't a woman learn
To use her head?

2357
02:28:43,247 --> 02:28:45,874
Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?

2358
02:28:46,083 --> 02:28:49,377
Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?

2359
02:28:49,587 --> 02:28:52,589
Why can't a woman
Take after a man?

2360
02:28:52,798 --> 02:28:55,926
Men are so pleasant
So easy to please

2361
02:28:56,135 --> 02:28:59,220
Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease

2362
02:28:59,430 --> 02:29:01,723
Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?

2363
02:29:01,933 --> 02:29:02,974
Of course not.

2364
02:29:03,184 --> 02:29:04,893
Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?

2365
02:29:05,102 --> 02:29:06,144
Nonsense.

2366
02:29:06,354 --> 02:29:08,313
Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?

2367
02:29:08,522 --> 02:29:09,564
Never.

2368
02:29:09,774 --> 02:29:12,192
Well, why can't a woman
Be like you?

2369
02:29:13,235 --> 02:29:15,779
One man in a million
May shout a bit

2370
02:29:16,572 --> 02:29:19,282
Now and then
There's one with slight defects

2371
02:29:19,992 --> 02:29:22,327
One, perhaps, whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit

2372
02:29:22,536 --> 02:29:26,289
But by and large
We are a marvelous sex

2373
02:29:26,499 --> 02:29:29,459
Why can't a woman
Take after a man?

2374
02:29:29,669 --> 02:29:32,671
Because men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind

2375
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:35,840
A better companion
You never will find

2376
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:38,802
If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?

2377
02:29:39,011 --> 02:29:40,053
Of course not.

2378
02:29:40,262 --> 02:29:42,222
If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?

2379
02:29:42,431 --> 02:29:43,473
Nonsense.

2380
02:29:43,683 --> 02:29:45,600
Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?

2381
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:46,851
Never.

2382
02:29:47,061 --> 02:29:49,145
Well, why can't a woman
Be like us?

2383
02:29:51,816 --> 02:29:53,692
Oh, hello.
Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

2384
02:29:53,901 --> 02:29:56,277
- Yes, Budgin here.
- Bruzzie.

2385
02:29:56,487 --> 02:29:58,989
Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never
never guess who this is.

2386
02:29:59,198 --> 02:30:00,615
Oh, don't be silly. It's Pickering.

2387
02:30:00,825 --> 02:30:02,742
You're quite right, yes, it is.
Good heavens.

2388
02:30:02,952 --> 02:30:05,412
By George, what a memory.

2389
02:30:05,621 --> 02:30:07,122
How are you, Bruzzie?

2390
02:30:07,331 --> 02:30:09,249
Nice to hear your voice.

2391
02:30:09,458 --> 02:30:12,794
What? Oh, don't say that.
Is it already 30 years? Good heavens.

2392
02:30:13,004 --> 02:30:14,879
You're quite right.
Yes, oceans of water.

2393
02:30:15,089 --> 02:30:16,881
Listen, Bruzzie,
I'll tell you why I rang up.

2394
02:30:17,091 --> 02:30:20,343
Something rather unpleasant's
happened. Could I come and see you?

2395
02:30:20,553 --> 02:30:22,470
Well, I could.
Yes, now, straight away.

2396
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:24,139
Right-o, good. Thank you, thank you.

2397
02:30:24,348 --> 02:30:26,599
Goodbye, Bruzzie.
Thank you very much.

2398
02:30:33,482 --> 02:30:36,776
Oh, Mrs. Pearce,
I'm going along to the Home Office.

2399
02:30:36,986 --> 02:30:39,195
Oh, I do hope you find her,
Colonel Pickering.

2400
02:30:39,405 --> 02:30:41,072
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

2401
02:30:41,282 --> 02:30:42,741
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?

2402
02:30:42,950 --> 02:30:46,161
Blast Mr. Higgins. I'll miss her.

2403
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:49,122
HIGGINS:
Pickering?

2404
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:53,043
Pickering?

2405
02:30:56,964 --> 02:30:58,339
Oh, Mrs. Pearce?

2406
02:30:58,549 --> 02:31:00,425
PEARCE: Yes, sir?
- Where's the colonel?

2407
02:31:00,634 --> 02:31:02,218
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

2408
02:31:03,387 --> 02:31:04,846
Oh, there you are.

2409
02:31:05,056 --> 02:31:10,185
I'm disturbed and he runs for help.
Now, there's a good fellow.

2410
02:31:10,561 --> 02:31:14,022
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

2411
02:31:14,231 --> 02:31:17,734
[SINGING] Why can't a woman
Be more like a man?

2412
02:31:17,943 --> 02:31:20,987
Men are so decent
Such regular chaps

2413
02:31:21,197 --> 02:31:24,199
Ready to help you
Through any mishaps

2414
02:31:24,408 --> 02:31:27,410
Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum

2415
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:30,747
Why can't a woman be a chum?

2416
02:31:31,582 --> 02:31:34,167
Why is thinking
Something women never do?

2417
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:37,712
Why is logic never even tried?

2418
02:31:38,172 --> 02:31:41,007
Straightening up their hair
Is all they ever do

2419
02:31:41,217 --> 02:31:44,552
Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?

2420
02:31:44,762 --> 02:31:47,555
Why can't a woman
Behave like a man?

2421
02:31:48,057 --> 02:31:51,101
If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball

2422
02:31:51,310 --> 02:31:54,354
Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all

2423
02:31:54,563 --> 02:31:57,524
Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?

2424
02:31:57,733 --> 02:32:00,652
Or carry on
As if my home were in a tree?

2425
02:32:00,861 --> 02:32:03,530
Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?

2426
02:32:04,115 --> 02:32:07,617
Why can't a woman be like me?

2427
02:32:11,372 --> 02:32:12,997
Do you mean to say
that after you'd done

2428
02:32:13,207 --> 02:32:15,708
this wonderful thing for them
without making a single mistake,

2429
02:32:15,918 --> 02:32:17,877
they just sat there,
never said a word to you?

2430
02:32:18,087 --> 02:32:21,673
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

2431
02:32:21,882 --> 02:32:24,926
Not a word. They just sat there
congratulating each other

2432
02:32:25,136 --> 02:32:26,386
on how marvelous they'd been.

2433
02:32:26,595 --> 02:32:30,181
How glad they were it was all over
and what a bore it had all been.

2434
02:32:30,391 --> 02:32:31,599
This is simply appalling.

2435
02:32:31,809 --> 02:32:33,560
I should not have thrown
my slippers at him,

2436
02:32:33,769 --> 02:32:35,603
I should've thrown the fire irons.

2437
02:32:35,813 --> 02:32:37,188
HIGGINS: Oh, is mother in?
- What's that?

2438
02:32:37,398 --> 02:32:38,690
Henry.

2439
02:32:38,899 --> 02:32:41,442
I knew it wouldn't be too long.

2440
02:32:41,652 --> 02:32:43,611
Now, remember,

2441
02:32:43,821 --> 02:32:45,905
you not only danced
with a prince last night,

2442
02:32:46,115 --> 02:32:48,950
you behaved like a princess.

2443
02:32:54,999 --> 02:32:58,084
Mother, the most confounded thing.
Do you...?

2444
02:33:01,255 --> 02:33:02,422
You?

2445
02:33:03,048 --> 02:33:05,925
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2446
02:33:07,136 --> 02:33:08,720
- Am I...?
- Of course you are.

2447
02:33:08,929 --> 02:33:12,307
You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2448
02:33:12,516 --> 02:33:15,476
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2449
02:33:15,686 --> 02:33:17,604
Now, get up and come home
and stop being a fool.

2450
02:33:17,813 --> 02:33:19,105
You've caused me enough trouble.

2451
02:33:19,315 --> 02:33:20,940
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.

2452
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:22,901
No woman could resist
such an invitation.

2453
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:25,069
How did this baggage get here
in the first place?

2454
02:33:25,279 --> 02:33:27,906
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2455
02:33:28,115 --> 02:33:30,658
And if you don't promise to behave,
I must ask you to leave.

2456
02:33:30,868 --> 02:33:32,785
You mean to say I'm to put on
my Sunday manners

2457
02:33:32,995 --> 02:33:35,622
for this thing that I created
out of the squashed cabbage leaves

2458
02:33:35,831 --> 02:33:36,873
of Covent Garden?

2459
02:33:37,082 --> 02:33:38,208
That's precisely what I mean.

2460
02:33:38,417 --> 02:33:40,084
Well, I'll see her damned first.

2461
02:33:40,294 --> 02:33:43,213
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2462
02:33:43,422 --> 02:33:45,256
It was very difficult.

2463
02:33:45,466 --> 02:33:47,842
I should never have known
how ladies and gentlemen behave

2464
02:33:48,052 --> 02:33:50,762
if it hadn't been
for Colonel Pickering.

2465
02:33:52,056 --> 02:33:54,182
He always showed me
that he felt and thought about me

2466
02:33:54,391 --> 02:33:57,769
as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2467
02:34:00,356 --> 02:34:04,150
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up,

2468
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:06,236
the difference between a lady
and a flower girl

2469
02:34:06,445 --> 02:34:09,280
is not how she behaves,
but how she is treated.

2470
02:34:12,701 --> 02:34:14,786
I shall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins

2471
02:34:14,995 --> 02:34:17,956
because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2472
02:34:19,375 --> 02:34:22,043
But I know I shall always be a lady
to Colonel Pickering

2473
02:34:22,253 --> 02:34:25,546
because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2474
02:34:28,259 --> 02:34:29,592
[GROWLS]

2475
02:34:29,927 --> 02:34:31,302
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2476
02:34:31,512 --> 02:34:34,138
The bishop is here, madam.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2477
02:34:34,348 --> 02:34:36,766
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no.

2478
02:34:36,976 --> 02:34:41,562
I should be excommunicated.
I'll see him in the library.

2479
02:34:41,772 --> 02:34:44,399
Eliza, if my son
starts breaking up things,

2480
02:34:44,608 --> 02:34:47,151
I give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2481
02:34:47,361 --> 02:34:50,238
Henry, dear, I suggest you stick
to two subjects:

2482
02:34:50,447 --> 02:34:52,782
The weather and your health.

2483
02:35:19,435 --> 02:35:21,686
Well, you've had a bit
of your own back, as you call it.

2484
02:35:21,895 --> 02:35:24,022
Have you had enough
and are you going to be reasonable

2485
02:35:24,231 --> 02:35:25,273
or do you want any more?

2486
02:35:25,482 --> 02:35:27,275
You want me back
only to pick up your slippers

2487
02:35:27,484 --> 02:35:30,069
and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2488
02:35:30,279 --> 02:35:32,405
- I didn't say I wanted you back at all.
- Oh, indeed?

2489
02:35:32,614 --> 02:35:35,366
- Then what are we talking about?
- Well, about you, not about me.

2490
02:35:35,576 --> 02:35:38,202
If you come back, you'll be treated
as you've always been treated.

2491
02:35:38,412 --> 02:35:40,872
I can't change my nature.
I don't intend to change my manners.

2492
02:35:41,081 --> 02:35:43,291
My manners are exactly the same
as Colonel Pickering's.

2493
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:44,542
That's not true.

2494
02:35:44,752 --> 02:35:47,128
He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2495
02:35:47,338 --> 02:35:49,422
Well, I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2496
02:35:49,631 --> 02:35:50,965
Oh, I see. The same to everybody.

2497
02:35:51,175 --> 02:35:52,258
Just so.

2498
02:35:52,468 --> 02:35:55,178
You see, the great secret, Eliza,
is not a question of good manners

2499
02:35:55,387 --> 02:35:58,848
or bad manners
or any particular sort of manners,

2500
02:35:59,058 --> 02:36:04,145
but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2501
02:36:04,355 --> 02:36:06,564
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely,

2502
02:36:06,774 --> 02:36:10,109
whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2503
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:12,362
I don't care how you treat me.

2504
02:36:12,571 --> 02:36:13,988
I don't mind your swearing at me.

2505
02:36:14,198 --> 02:36:16,491
I shouldn't mind a black eye.
I've had one before this.

2506
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:18,576
But I won't be passed over.

2507
02:36:18,786 --> 02:36:20,995
Well, then get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2508
02:36:21,205 --> 02:36:22,997
You talk about me
as though I was a motor bus.

2509
02:36:23,207 --> 02:36:24,248
So you are a motor bus.

2510
02:36:24,458 --> 02:36:27,293
All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2511
02:36:27,503 --> 02:36:30,254
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't.

2512
02:36:30,464 --> 02:36:33,257
I know you can. I told you you could.

2513
02:36:36,136 --> 02:36:41,015
You've never wondered, I suppose
whether I could get along without you.

2514
02:36:42,393 --> 02:36:44,519
Don't you try to get around me.

2515
02:36:44,728 --> 02:36:45,853
You'll have to.

2516
02:36:46,605 --> 02:36:49,982
So I can, without you
or any soul on earth.

2517
02:36:52,444 --> 02:36:54,153
I shall miss you, Eliza.

2518
02:36:54,363 --> 02:36:57,073
I've learned something
from your idiotic notions.

2519
02:36:57,282 --> 02:37:00,326
I confess that, humbly and gratefully.

2520
02:37:02,830 --> 02:37:05,123
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2521
02:37:05,332 --> 02:37:07,667
When you feel lonely without me,
you can turn it on.

2522
02:37:07,876 --> 02:37:09,419
It has no feelings to hurt.

2523
02:37:11,338 --> 02:37:14,674
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2524
02:37:16,844 --> 02:37:19,679
Ooh. You are a devil.

2525
02:37:19,888 --> 02:37:22,348
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily

2526
02:37:22,558 --> 02:37:24,892
as someone can twist her arms
to hurt her.

2527
02:37:25,102 --> 02:37:26,853
What am I to come back for?

2528
02:37:27,062 --> 02:37:29,230
For the fun of it.
That's why I took you on.

2529
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:32,400
And you may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want me to.

2530
02:37:32,609 --> 02:37:35,653
Yes, and you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want me to.

2531
02:37:35,863 --> 02:37:36,904
And live with my father?

2532
02:37:37,114 --> 02:37:39,407
Yes, or sell flowers.
Or would you rather marry Pickering?

2533
02:37:39,616 --> 02:37:41,075
I wouldn't marry you
if you asked me,

2534
02:37:41,285 --> 02:37:42,910
and you're nearer my age
than what he is.

2535
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:44,829
- Than he is.
- I'll talk as I like.

2536
02:37:45,038 --> 02:37:46,581
You're not my teacher now.

2537
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:49,542
That's not what I want,
and you don't think it is.

2538
02:37:49,751 --> 02:37:51,794
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2539
02:37:52,004 --> 02:37:54,088
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day.

2540
02:37:54,298 --> 02:37:55,756
Sheets and sheets.

2541
02:37:55,966 --> 02:37:58,426
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is.

2542
02:37:58,635 --> 02:38:00,553
- Is that it?
- No, I don't.

2543
02:38:00,762 --> 02:38:04,140
That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2544
02:38:04,349 --> 02:38:06,517
I want a little kindness.

2545
02:38:06,727 --> 02:38:09,854
I know I'm a common ignorant girl
and you're a book-learned gentleman.

2546
02:38:10,063 --> 02:38:12,607
But I'm not dirt under your feet.

2547
02:38:12,816 --> 02:38:14,233
What I done...

2548
02:38:14,443 --> 02:38:17,987
What I did
was not for the taxis and the dresses,

2549
02:38:18,197 --> 02:38:21,449
but because we were
pleasant together and I've come to...

2550
02:38:21,658 --> 02:38:25,036
Came to care for you.

2551
02:38:25,245 --> 02:38:26,621
Not to want you to make love to me

2552
02:38:26,830 --> 02:38:28,623
and not forgetting
the difference between us,

2553
02:38:28,832 --> 02:38:32,335
but more friendly-like.

2554
02:38:33,962 --> 02:38:36,631
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2555
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:39,509
And how Pickering feels.

2556
02:38:39,718 --> 02:38:41,928
- Eliza, you're a fool.
- That's not the proper answer.

2557
02:38:42,137 --> 02:38:44,096
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2558
02:38:44,306 --> 02:38:46,265
If you're a lady,
give up feeling neglected

2559
02:38:46,475 --> 02:38:48,351
if the men you know
don't spend half their time

2560
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:51,020
sniveling over you and the other half
giving you black eyes.

2561
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:53,648
You find me cold, unfeeling,
selfish, don't you?

2562
02:38:53,857 --> 02:38:55,733
Be off with you
to the sort of people you like.

2563
02:38:55,943 --> 02:38:57,735
Marry some sentimental hog
with lots of money

2564
02:38:57,945 --> 02:39:00,988
and a thick pair of lips to kiss you
and a thick pair of boots to kick you.

2565
02:39:01,198 --> 02:39:04,200
If you can't appreciate what you've got,
get what you can appreciate.

2566
02:39:04,409 --> 02:39:05,576
Oh, I can't talk to you.

2567
02:39:05,786 --> 02:39:09,038
You always turn everything
against me. I'm always in the wrong.

2568
02:39:09,248 --> 02:39:11,374
But don't be too sure
that you have me under your feet

2569
02:39:11,583 --> 02:39:13,251
to be trampled on and talked down.

2570
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:16,295
I'll marry, Freddy, I will,
soon as I'm able to support him.

2571
02:39:17,297 --> 02:39:18,756
Freddy?

2572
02:39:18,966 --> 02:39:21,175
That poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy

2573
02:39:21,385 --> 02:39:23,094
even if he had the guts to try for it?

2574
02:39:23,303 --> 02:39:26,973
Woman, don't you understand?
I've made you a consort for a king.

2575
02:39:27,182 --> 02:39:30,101
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2576
02:39:30,310 --> 02:39:33,187
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to it as I was.

2577
02:39:33,397 --> 02:39:34,981
I'll go and be a teacher.

2578
02:39:35,524 --> 02:39:37,066
What will you teach,
in heaven's name?

2579
02:39:37,568 --> 02:39:40,069
What you taught me.
I'll teach phonetics.

2580
02:39:41,113 --> 02:39:43,614
Ha, ha, ha.

2581
02:39:44,199 --> 02:39:48,953
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2582
02:39:49,663 --> 02:39:53,499
What, that impostor? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2583
02:39:53,709 --> 02:39:55,710
Teach him my methods,
my discoveries?

2584
02:39:55,919 --> 02:39:58,879
You take one step in that direction
and I'll wring your neck.

2585
02:39:59,089 --> 02:40:03,426
Wring away. What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2586
02:40:06,013 --> 02:40:08,222
That's done you, Henry Higgins,
it has.

2587
02:40:08,432 --> 02:40:12,518
Now, I don't care that
for your bullying and your big talk.

2588
02:40:12,728 --> 02:40:16,397
[SINGING] What a fool I was
What a dominated fool

2589
02:40:16,607 --> 02:40:19,817
To think you were the earth and sky

2590
02:40:20,027 --> 02:40:23,529
What a fool I was
What an elevated fool

2591
02:40:23,739 --> 02:40:27,491
What a mutton-headed dolt was I

2592
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:31,829
No, my reverberating friend

2593
02:40:32,039 --> 02:40:36,667
You are not the beginning
And the end

2594
02:40:38,962 --> 02:40:40,546
You impudent hussy.

2595
02:40:40,756 --> 02:40:43,257
There's not an idea in your head
or a word in your mouth

2596
02:40:43,467 --> 02:40:44,967
that I haven't put there.

2597
02:40:46,637 --> 02:40:51,891
There'll be spring every year
Without you

2598
02:40:52,100 --> 02:40:55,728
England still will be here
Without you

2599
02:40:55,937 --> 02:40:59,523
There'll be fruit on the tree
And a shore by the sea

2600
02:40:59,733 --> 02:41:03,361
There'll be crumpets and tea
Without you

2601
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:07,198
Art and music will thrive
Without you

2602
02:41:07,407 --> 02:41:10,951
Somehow Keats will survive
Without you

2603
02:41:11,161 --> 02:41:14,914
And there still will be rain
On that plain down in Spain

2604
02:41:15,123 --> 02:41:18,709
Even that will remain
Without you

2605
02:41:18,919 --> 02:41:22,630
I can do

2606
02:41:22,839 --> 02:41:24,340
Without you

2607
02:41:25,300 --> 02:41:27,885
You, dear friend

2608
02:41:28,095 --> 02:41:31,972
Who talk so well

2609
02:41:32,599 --> 02:41:39,438
You can go to
Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

2610
02:41:39,648 --> 02:41:43,067
They can still rule the land
Without you

2611
02:41:43,276 --> 02:41:46,862
Windsor Castle will stand
Without you

2612
02:41:47,072 --> 02:41:48,781
And without much ado

2613
02:41:48,990 --> 02:41:51,867
We can all muddle through
Without you

2614
02:41:52,869 --> 02:41:54,870
You brazen hussy.

2615
02:41:55,372 --> 02:41:59,291
Without your pulling it
The tide comes in

2616
02:41:59,501 --> 02:42:03,462
Without your twirling it
The Earth can spin

2617
02:42:03,672 --> 02:42:08,718
Without your pushing them
The clouds roll by

2618
02:42:08,927 --> 02:42:14,140
If they can do without you
Ducky, so can I

2619
02:42:14,349 --> 02:42:17,852
I shall not feel alone
Without you

2620
02:42:18,061 --> 02:42:21,564
I can stand on my own
Without you

2621
02:42:21,773 --> 02:42:25,860
So go back in your shell
I can do bloody well

2622
02:42:26,069 --> 02:42:28,904
- Without...
[SINGING] By George, I really did it

2623
02:42:29,114 --> 02:42:30,156
I did it, I did it

2624
02:42:30,365 --> 02:42:32,783
I said I'd make a woman
And indeed I did

2625
02:42:32,993 --> 02:42:35,619
I knew that I could do it
I knew it, I knew it

2626
02:42:35,829 --> 02:42:38,539
I said I'd make a woman
And succeed I did

2627
02:42:38,749 --> 02:42:40,708
Eliza, you're magnificent.

2628
02:42:40,917 --> 02:42:43,335
Five minutes ago, you were a millstone
around my neck

2629
02:42:43,545 --> 02:42:45,421
and now you're a tower of strength.

2630
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:48,424
A consort battleship.

2631
02:42:48,633 --> 02:42:50,468
I like you this way.

2632
02:42:52,471 --> 02:42:54,346
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.

2633
02:42:54,556 --> 02:42:57,224
You shall not be seeing me again.

2634
02:43:09,946 --> 02:43:12,239
Mother!

2635
02:43:12,449 --> 02:43:13,532
Mother!

2636
02:43:14,326 --> 02:43:16,410
What is it, Henry?
What's happened?

2637
02:43:18,163 --> 02:43:19,246
She's gone.

2638
02:43:19,456 --> 02:43:21,791
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?

2639
02:43:23,251 --> 02:43:24,710
Well...

2640
02:43:25,796 --> 02:43:28,255
- What am I to do?
- Do without, I suppose.

2641
02:43:30,342 --> 02:43:33,344
And so I shall.

2642
02:43:35,388 --> 02:43:38,390
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs,

2643
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:41,769
let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her.

2644
02:43:41,978 --> 02:43:45,898
She's an owl sickened by a few days
of my sunshine.

2645
02:43:46,107 --> 02:43:47,900
Very well, let her go.
I can do without her.

2646
02:43:48,109 --> 02:43:50,319
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul.

2647
02:43:50,529 --> 02:43:54,573
My own spark of divine fire.

2648
02:43:57,536 --> 02:43:59,829
Bravo, Eliza.

2649
02:44:19,391 --> 02:44:22,726
[SINGING]
Damn, damn, damn, damn

2650
02:44:24,896 --> 02:44:26,939
I've grown accustomed to her face

2651
02:44:30,819 --> 02:44:32,903
She almost makes the day begin

2652
02:44:34,030 --> 02:44:37,241
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon

2653
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:41,120
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs

2654
02:44:41,329 --> 02:44:43,247
Are second nature to me now

2655
02:44:44,499 --> 02:44:46,709
Like breathing out and breathing in

2656
02:44:47,836 --> 02:44:51,630
I was serenely independent
And content before we met

2657
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:55,050
Surely I could always
Be that way again

2658
02:44:56,803 --> 02:45:00,806
And yet I've grown accustomed
To her look

2659
02:45:01,391 --> 02:45:03,225
Accustomed to her voice

2660
02:45:03,894 --> 02:45:08,314
Accustomed to her face

2661
02:45:22,495 --> 02:45:25,456
Marry Freddy.
What an infantile idea.

2662
02:45:25,665 --> 02:45:28,876
What a heartless, wicked,
brainless thing to do.

2663
02:45:29,085 --> 02:45:32,296
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.

2664
02:45:32,505 --> 02:45:36,300
It's doomed before
they even take the vow.

2665
02:45:36,801 --> 02:45:40,471
[SINGING] I can see her now
Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill

2666
02:45:40,680 --> 02:45:43,223
In a wretched little flat
Above a store

2667
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:46,560
I can see her now
Not a penny in the till

2668
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:49,271
And a bill collector
Beating at the door

2669
02:45:49,898 --> 02:45:52,274
She'll try to teach the things
I taught her

2670
02:45:52,776 --> 02:45:55,110
And end up selling flowers instead

2671
02:45:55,779 --> 02:45:58,072
Begging for her bread and water

2672
02:45:58,281 --> 02:46:01,617
While her husband
Has his breakfast in bed

2673
02:46:04,621 --> 02:46:08,874
In a year or so
When she's prematurely grey

2674
02:46:09,084 --> 02:46:12,628
And the blossom in her cheek
Has turned to chalk

2675
02:46:12,837 --> 02:46:14,380
She'll come home, and lo

2676
02:46:14,589 --> 02:46:16,048
He'll have upped and run away

2677
02:46:16,257 --> 02:46:19,009
With a social-climbing heiress
From New York

2678
02:46:19,219 --> 02:46:20,511
Poor Eliza

2679
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:22,221
How simply frightful

2680
02:46:22,430 --> 02:46:24,473
How humiliating

2681
02:46:24,683 --> 02:46:26,433
How delightful

2682
02:46:28,979 --> 02:46:31,814
How poignant it'll be
On that inevitable night

2683
02:46:32,023 --> 02:46:34,858
When she hammers on my door
In tears and rags

2684
02:46:35,276 --> 02:46:38,529
Miserable and lonely
Repentant and contrite

2685
02:46:39,155 --> 02:46:41,657
Will I take her in
Or hurl her to the wolves?

2686
02:46:41,866 --> 02:46:44,868
Give her kindness
Or the treatment she deserves?

2687
02:46:45,078 --> 02:46:48,664
Will I take her back
Or throw the baggage out?

2688
02:46:51,334 --> 02:46:53,544
Well, I'm a most forgiving man

2689
02:46:54,045 --> 02:46:56,880
The sort who never could
Ever would

2690
02:46:57,090 --> 02:47:00,843
Take a position
And staunchly never budge

2691
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,806
A most forgiving man

2692
02:47:08,727 --> 02:47:11,103
But I shall never take her back

2693
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:13,897
If she were crawling on her knees

2694
02:47:14,733 --> 02:47:17,317
Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan

2695
02:47:17,527 --> 02:47:21,613
I'll slam the door
And let the hellcat freeze

2696
02:47:24,284 --> 02:47:27,786
Marry Freddy. Ha!

2697
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:46,138
But I'm so used to hear her say
Good morning every day

2698
02:47:46,347 --> 02:47:51,560
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows

2699
02:47:51,770 --> 02:47:54,229
Are second nature to me now

2700
02:47:55,732 --> 02:47:58,233
Like breathing out and breathing in

2701
02:47:59,861 --> 02:48:01,779
I'm very grateful she's a woman

2702
02:48:01,988 --> 02:48:03,781
And so easy to forget

2703
02:48:04,449 --> 02:48:08,285
Rather like a habit
One can always break

2704
02:48:10,371 --> 02:48:15,501
And yet I've grown
Accustomed to the trace

2705
02:48:15,710 --> 02:48:18,629
Of something in the air

2706
02:48:19,631 --> 02:48:24,927
Accustomed to her face

ELIZA [ON RECORDING]:
Oh, we are proud.

2708
02:50:03,985 --> 02:50:07,112
He ain't above giving lessons, not him.
I heard him say so.

2709
02:50:07,322 --> 02:50:09,323
Well, I ain't come here
to ask for any compliment,

2710
02:50:09,532 --> 02:50:12,451
and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

2711
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:13,869
HIGGINS:
Good enough for what?

2712
02:50:14,078 --> 02:50:15,537
ELIZA:
Good enough for you.

2713
02:50:15,747 --> 02:50:16,872
Now you know, don't you?

2714
02:50:17,081 --> 02:50:19,374
I'm come to have lessons,
I am, and to pay for them too,

2715
02:50:19,584 --> 02:50:20,626
make no mistake.

PICKERING:
What is it you want, my girl?

2717
02:50:22,337 --> 02:50:25,130
ELIZA:
I want to be a lady in a flower shop

2718
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:28,300
instead of selling at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

2719
02:50:28,509 --> 02:50:31,470
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

2720
02:50:31,679 --> 02:50:33,513
He said he could teach me.

2721
02:50:33,723 --> 02:50:34,765
Well, here I am.

2722
02:50:34,974 --> 02:50:36,934
Ready to pay,
not asking any favor.

2723

And he treats me as if I was dirt.

2724

I know what lessons cost as well
as you do, and I'm ready to pay.

2725
02:50:43,858 --> 02:50:46,902
I won't give more than a schilling.
Take it or leave it.

HIGGINS: It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.

2727
02:50:52,075 --> 02:50:53,784
So horribly dirty.

2728
02:50:53,993 --> 02:50:55,160
I'll take it.

2729
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:58,789
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.
