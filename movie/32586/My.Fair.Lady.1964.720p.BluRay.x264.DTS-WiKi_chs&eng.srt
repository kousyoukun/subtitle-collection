佛雷狄，去找部车来！

8
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,878
你要我得肺炎吗？
Do you want me to catch pneumonia

9
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,331
别楞在那里，佛雷狄 去找部车来

-Freddy, go and find a cab . -Yes, Mother.

15
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,697
他是你的儿子吗？
Oh, he's your son, is he?

16
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,099
如果你尽到一个作母亲的责任
lf you'd done your duty by him as a mother should...

17
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:58,140
你就应该为此事赔偿 而非置之不理啊
you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girI's flow'rs and then run away without payin'.

18
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,141
去作你的生意，小女孩
Oh, go about your business , my girl.

19
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,144
你一点都不愿意赔偿？
And you wouldn't go of without payin', either.

20
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,177
两束紫罗兰掉到泥里
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

21
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,885
先生，雨会停吗？
Oh, sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

22
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:14,286
恐怕不会 现在比刚刚下得还要大
I'm afraid not lt's worse than before.

23
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,919
如果下得更大 那就是快停的征兆了
lf it's worse , it's a sign it's nearly over.

24
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,824
开心点，长官 买一束可怜女孩的花吧
Cheer up, Capt'n , buy a flow'r of a poor girl.

25
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,328
很抱歉，我没零钱
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

26
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,025
我可以找钱给你 来吧，一朵才两便士
l can change 'alf a crown. Here, take this for tuppence.

27
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,602
我告诉过你，我很抱歉 等一下
ltold you, I'm awfully sorry. Wait a minute .

28
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,900
有了，三便士，对你可能有用
Oh, yes Here's three hapence, if that 's any use to you.

29
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,371
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

30
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,682
听着，你小心点 最好给他一束花
Here, you be careful. Better give 'im a flower for it

31
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:46,484
柱子后面有个家伙 把你所说的话都记下来了
There's a bloke here behind that pillar ...takin' down every blessed word you're sayin'.

32
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,822
我跟他说话又没做错什么事
lain't done nothin' wrong by speakin' to the gentleman.

33
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:57,957
我有权利在这里卖花 我是人格高尚的女孩，帮帮我
I've a right t' sell flow'rs if I keep of the curb. I'm a respectable girl, so help me .

34
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,230
我只请他买花又没跟他说话
l never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flow'r of me .

35
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,196
为何如此吵？ 有个侦探纪录她的话
-What 's all the bloomin' noise ? -There's a tec takin' her down.

36
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,104
我是自立维生
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

37
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,006
是谁这么吵闹？
Who's doing all that shouting?

38
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:13,140
先生，别让他起诉我 你不知道这会对我有多大影响
Sir, don't let 'im charge me . You dunno what it means to me .

39
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:16,878
他们会取消我的资格 只因我在街上跟男士说话
They'll take away me character and drive me on the streets ...for speakin' t' gentlemen.

40
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:21,753
好了…谁要伤害你，傻女孩？ 你以为我是谁啊？
There, there, there. Who's hurting you, you silly girl? What 'd you take me for?

41
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,485
我对圣经发誓我并没有说话
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

42
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,686
闭嘴！…我像警察吗？
Shut up! Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

43
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:29,094
你为何记下我的话？ 我认识你可以这样吗？
Then what 'd ya take down me words for? 'Ow do I know you took me down right

44
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,690
给我看你写了我些什么事情
You just show me what you wrote ab 'ut me .

45
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,670
这不是正确的写字方法 我看不懂
That ain't proper writin'. I can' t read it

46
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:42,745
我看得懂
l can

47
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:47,010
开心点，长官 买一束可怜女孩的花吧
''l say, Capt'n , now buy a flow'r of a poor girl.''

48
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:52,677
只因为我叫他长官吗
Oh, it's cause I called him ''Capt'n .''

49
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,623
我无意伤人，先生 别让他因这个字而起诉我
lmeant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay a charge against me for a word like that .

50
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,992
起诉？我不会让他起诉你 先生，如果你是侦探
I'll make no charge. Really, sir, if you are a detective...

51
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:05,227
除非我要求，你不需要怕我 被这小女孩欺负而保护我
you needn't begin protecting me against molestation from young women...until I ask you.

52
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,599
任何人都看得出来 这女孩伤不了人的
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

53
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,739
他不是侦探 看他穿的皮靴就知道他是绅士
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman. Look at his boots .

54
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,931
你们怎么都是来自塞西？
How are all your people down at Selsey?

55
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,510
谁告诉你我们来自塞西？
Who told you my people come from Selsey?

56
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:16,943
你别管，他们是的
Never mind, they do.

57
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,807
你怎会到这么遥远的东部来？ 你来自利索格罗夫
How do you come to be up so far east You were born in Lisson Grove.

58
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:26,177
我离开利索格罗夫 又有何不对？
Oh, what 'arm is there in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

59
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,358
那里连猪都活不下去 我一星期得付四到六元的房租
lt weren't fit for pigs to live. I had to pay four and six a week.

60
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,188
去住你喜欢住的地方 但别再吵了！
Live where you like but stop that noise !

61
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,821
冷静点！他不会抓你的 你有权利住你想住的地方！
Come , come , he can' t touch you. You've a right to live where you please.

62
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,796
我是个好女孩，真的
I'm a good girl, I am .

63
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,767
你知我从那儿来的吗？ 霍克斯顿
-Where do I come from -Hawkestone.

64
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:42,599
真的是耶，我的天啊 你无所不知啊
Who said I didn't Blimey, you know everything, you do.

65
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:45,936
先生 你能帮我找部计程车吗？
You, sir, do you think you could find me a taxi?

66
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:50,511
女士，雨停了 你可以搭公车会汉普顿
Madam , it's stopped raining.You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court

67
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:52,441
那是你住的地方吧？
That 's where you live, isn 't it

68
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,243
真是没礼貌！
What an impertinence!

69
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:58,051
如果你要算命 告诉我他打哪儿来
Tell 'im where he comes from if you wanta go fortune-telling.

70
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:06,317
赤尔登罕，哈络，剑桥还有…
Cheltenham , Harrow...Cambridge and ...

71
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:09,221
印度？
lndia

72
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,457
对极了
Quite right

73
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,232
天啊，他不是侦探 他是个非常爱管事的人
Blimey, he ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

74
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:16,169
请问你是以此维生音乐人吗？
Do you do this sort of thing for a living at a music hall?

75
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,365
我有考虑过 也许有一天会这样做
l have thought of it Perhaps I will one day .

76
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,773
他不是位绅士 只会欺负可怜的女孩子
He's no gentleman, he ain't, to interfere with a poor girl!

77
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:23,470
请教你是从事什么工作？
How do you do it, may I ask?

78
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,708
语言学，说话的科学 这是我的专业和也是嗜好
Simple phonetics The science of speech. That 's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,085
每个人都可以从他的土腔 分辨出是爱尔兰人或约克郡人
Anyone can spot an lrishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

80
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:34,315
我可以分辨出 每隔六哩的不同人
but I can place a man within six miles

81
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:38,258
在伦敦每隔二哩就会有不同 有时甚至两条街
l can place 'im within two miles in London. Sometimes within two streets .

82
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:41,159
他应该自觉可耻，胆小鬼
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself unmanly coward.

83
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,095
以此维生吗？ 是的
-ls there a living in that ? -Oh, yes

84
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,225
就让他忙他自己的事 别管这位可怜的女孩
Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl alone.

85
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:52,400
女人，马上停止这讨厌的哭声 或是躲到别处去吧！
Cease this detestable boohooing instantly...or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship!

86
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,276
我有权待在我喜欢的地方 跟你一样！
l have a right to be here if I like, same as you!

87
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:59,276
发出如此讨厌声音的女人
A woman who utters such disgusting and depressing noises ..

88
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,907
就没有资格到处走 没有资格生活
has no right to be anywhere, no right to live.

89
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,421
记住，你是一个有灵魂的人 并具有口齿清楚的天赋
Remember, you're a human being with a soul...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

90
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:11,090
你的母语是沙士比亚 弥尔顿和圣经的语言
That your native language is the language of Shakespeare and ...
Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.

91
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,061
别像讨厌的傻瓜般 坐在哪儿咆哮

92
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,766
看看她，下层人士的话语
Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters

93
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,060
她说的每个音节都不适当
Condemned by ev'ry syllable she utters

94
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:29,206
她应该被吊死 因为她无情地谋杀了英语
By right she should be taken out an'hungFor the cold-blooded murder Of the English tongue

95
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,848
天啊，这是什么声音！
Heavens, what a sound!

96
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:38,449
这就是英国人民 所谓的小学教育
This is what the British population
Calls an element'ry education

97
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,313
先生 你最好举个失败的例子说明
Come , sir, I think you've picked a poor example.

98
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:42,788
要吗？
Did l?

99
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,193
听听看苏活区的人 不发“H”的音
Hear them down in Soho Square Dropping ''Hs '' everywhere

100
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:49,730
照他们喜欢的英语发音
Speaking English any way they like

101
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,533
先生，你上过学吗？
Hey, you, sir, did you go to school?

102
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,262
你“以谓”我是傻瓜吗？
What ya tike me for, a fool?

103
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,998
没人教他“以谓” 是要发成“以为”
No one taught him ''take''instead of ''tike''

104
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:01,743
听约克人说话 更糟的是听康瓦耳人交谈
Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse Hear a Cornishman converse

105
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:04,244
我宁愿去听平调的诗歌
I'd rather hear a choir singing flat

106
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:08,681
如小鸡在粮仓里咯咯叫 就像她一样
Chickens cackling in a barn Just like this one

107
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,285
咯恩！
Garn!

108
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:11,785
咯恩！
Garn!

109
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:15,019
我请教你，先生 这是什么字？
l ask you, sir, what sort of word is that?

110
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:18,289
她总会发出“奥哦” 和“咯恩”的声音
lt's ''aoow''and ''garn '' That keep her in her place

111
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,328
不是因为她穿破烂衣服 不是因为她的脸很脏
Not her wretched clothes and dirty face

112
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,198
为何英国人 不能教小孩如何说话？
Why can't the English Teach their children how to speak?

113
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:29,905
上语言课时很容易区分 现在为时已晚了
This verbal class distinction By now should be antique

114
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:33,572
如果你说话跟她一样 不像现在这样说话
lf you spoke as she does, sir lnstead of the way you do

115
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,470
你大概也去卖花了
Why, you might be selling flowers, too

116
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,636
你说什么
l beg your pardon.

117
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:41,148
一个英国人说英语的方式 绝对会影响到他的地位
An Englishman's way of speaking Absolutely classifies him

118
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:44,783
他一讲英语其他人会鄙视他
The moment he talks he makes Some other Englishman despise him

119
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:48,290
我怕我们永远听不到正统语言
One common language I'm afraid we'll never get

120
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:51,857
为何不好好学英文？
Oh, why can't the English learn to

121
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:57,262
让我们有顺耳的英语 谁的英语会伤害你的耳朵
Set a good example to people Whose English is painful to your ears

122
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,160
苏格兰和爱尔兰的英语 听了会让你流泪
The Scotch and the lrish Leave you close to tears

123
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:05,731
甚至有些地方正统英语不见了
There even are places Where English completely disappears

124
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,933

Beer, beer, glorious beerFill yourself right up

252
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:36,715
你看她说的破英语 这种英语将伴随终身吗？
You see this creature with her curbstone English...
the English that will keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?

253
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:42,052
我训练她六个月后 可以像女公爵般出席大使舞会
ln six months, I could pass her off as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

254
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:47,232
我也能让她到需要说 正统英语的地方上班
l could even get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...which requires better English.

255
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,944
你污辱了这些高贵的建筑物！
You're a disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns!

256
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:10,082
我也能让她到需要说 正统英语的地方上班
l could even get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant...which requires better English.

257
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,112
你听到过多少个母音？
How many vowel sounds did you hear altogether?

258
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,848
我相信我听过24种
l believe I counted 24.

259
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:42,454
错了，应该有一百种！ 什么
Wrong by a hundred. 

260
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,650
正确是130种

261
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,352
一次把它们给听完
Listen to them one at a time .

262
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,453
需要吗？ 这样我一个早上就玩完了
Must I ? I'm really quite done up for one morning.

263
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,849
请问贵姓大名？
Your name, please?

264
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:16,883
贵姓大名？小姐！
Your name, Miss ?

265
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:20,127
我的名字跟你毫无关系
My name is of no concern to you whatsoever.

266
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,025
请等一下
One moment, please.

267
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,667
伦敦最近相当脏乱
London is gettin' so dirty these days

268
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:37,541
我是这里的管家皮尔斯太太 我能效劳吗？
I'm Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper. Can I help you?

269
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:41,205
哦，早安，小姐，我想见教授
Oh, good morning, Missus I'd like to see the professor, please.

270
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,042
有什么事吗？
Could you tell me what it's about

271
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:45,915
是个人的私事！
lt's business of a personal nature.

272
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,321
请等一下
One moment, please.

273
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,729
席根斯先生？ 什么事情，皮尔斯太太？
-Mr. Higgins -What is it, Mrs Pearce?

274
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,328
外面有位年轻女孩要见你 先生
There's a young woman who wants to see you, sir.

275
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,633
年轻女孩？
A young woman?

276
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:07,809
她想要干什么？
What does she want ?

277
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:10,571
她是个相当低俗的女孩 真的很低俗
She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed.

278
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:14,773
我应该叫她走的 只是我在想你可能要她录音
lshould've sent her away , only I thought perhaps ..you wanted her to talk into your machine.

279
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,716
她的音调很好玩吗？ 非常可怕，席根斯先生
-Has she an interesting accent -Simply ghastly, Mr. Higgins

280
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,516
好，叫她进来，皮尔斯太太 遵命
Good. Let's have her in. Show her in, Mrs Pearce.

281
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:25,059
运气真好 我让你看我是怎么录音的
You know, this is rather a bit of luck. I'll show you how I make records

282
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,062
我们先让她说话 把声音纪录到贝尔语音图形中
We'll set her talking and then I'll take her down first in BelI's Visible Speech...

283
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:32,327
然后找开口音 我们就录在留声机里
then in broad Romic, and then we'll get her on the phonograph...

284
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:36,427
当你想要誊写副本时 你就打开录音
so you can turn her on when you want with the written transcript before you.

285
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,871
就是这位年轻女孩，先生
This is the young woman, sir.

286
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,242
早安，我可以跟你谈谈吗？
Good mornin', my good man.Might I 'ave the pleasure of a word with you?

287
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:48,043
哦，不 我昨晚已经记载了她声音
Oh, no. This is the girl ljotted down last night

288
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,176
她没有用 我想录利索格罗夫的术语
She's no use . I've got the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo.

289
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,186
我不想浪费录音带
I'm not gonna waste another cylinder on that .

290
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:54,880
你请吧，我不需要你
Now be of with you. I don't want you.

291
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,221
别如此无礼 你还不知道我来此的原因
Don't be so saucy. You ain't 'eard what I come for yet

292
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,089
你没告诉她我坐车来的吗？
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

293
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:04,495
胡闹，女孩 你以为席根斯先生会管这些吗
Nonsense , girl. What do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares ..what you came in?

294
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,260
哦，都很骄傲
Oh, we are proud.

295
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:09,531
他不想教人说英语 但是我听到他说过的
Well, 'e ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so .

296
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:11,729
我不是来此致意的
lain't come here t' as for any compliment ..

297
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,604
如果我的钱不够我就去别处
and if my money's not good enough, I can go elsewhere.

298
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,074
够做什么？
Good enough for what ?

299
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:18,109
足够支付你上课的钱
Good enough for you.

300
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:24,245
懂了吗？我来这里上课的 并且是付学费，别搞错了
Now you know, don'tcha I'm come to 'ave lessons, I am .And to pay for 'em too, make no mistake.

301
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,709
Well!

302
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,013
你希望我对你说些什么？
And what do you expect me to say?

303
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:33,056
如果你是绅士就应该请我坐下
Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think.

304
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,124
你没听到我是带生意来给你的
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business ?

305
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:41,335
我们要请这个小妞坐下 还是丢出窗外？
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...or shall we just throw her out of the window?

306
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:45,873
我不是小妞 何况我像其他小姐一样会付钱
l won't be called a baggage. Not when I've ofered to pay like any lady.

307
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:48,233
你想要干什么，女孩？
What do you want , my girl?

308
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:57,347
我想要在花店当专柜小姐
l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...'stead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road .

309
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:00,182
除非我举止优雅 否则他们不会请我
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel.

310
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,724
他说他能教我 所以我来付钱请他教
'E said 'e could teach me .Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

311
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,056
不是要来占便宜的 他却如此对我
Not asking any favor and he treats me as if I was dirt

312
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:11,630
我知道你上课的价钱 所以我准备要付钱
l know what lessons cost as well as you do, and I'm ready t' pay .

313
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:15,934
付多少钱？
How much?

314
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:18,305
你终于说话了
Now you're talkin'.

315
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:22,803
我想你是要补偿 昨晚不该如此摒弃我
lthought you'd come of it for a chance o' gettin' back a bit ..of what you chucked at me last night

316
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,845
其实你很欢迎我，是吗？
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you, eh?

317
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:26,140
坐下
Sit down.

318
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:29,375
如果你要表达歉意… 坐下
-lf you're goin' t' make a compliment of it- - -Sit down!

319
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,682
坐下，女孩，照他的话做
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

320
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,655
贵姓大名？
What 's your name?

321
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,714
伊莱莎杜立特尔
Eliza Doolittle.

322
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,886
你不坐下吗，杜立特尔小姐？
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

323
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,122
我不介意坐下
I don't mind if I do.

324
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:51,865
你打算要给我多少学费？
How much do you propose to pay me for these lessons

325
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:53,563
哦，我知道行情的
Oh, I know what 's right

326
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:58,442
我的朋友和法国人学法语 每小时18便士
A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour...from a real French gentleman.

327
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:03,841
你不会有脸要我学自己的母语 付同样价钱
You wouldn't have the face t' as me the same ...
for teachin' me my own language as you would for French.

328
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:07,012
因此我只会给一先令 随便你要不要
So, I won't give more than a shillin'. Take it or leave it

329
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:12,085
平克林，如果你认为这一先令
Do you know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling...

330
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:16,753
这不是普通一先令 但以这女孩收入的百分比而言
not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girI's income ...

331
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:24,104
这相当百万富翁的 60或70英镑
it works out as fully equivalent of. ..60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

332
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,341
天啊，真多 这是我收入最多的一次
By George, it's enormous lt's the biggest ofer I ever had .

333
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:34,871
60英镑？你在说什么？ 我不能给你60英镑
Sixty pounds What are you talkin' about Where would I get 60 pounds I never ofered you 60 pounds

334
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,814
我没有60英镑！
But I ain't got 60 pounds

335
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,877
别哭，傻孩子，坐下 没人会动你的钱
Don't cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody's going to touch your money.

336
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:43,981
如果你还鬼叫 有人会用扫把打你
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick if you don't stop sniveling.

337
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,457
坐下！
Sit down!

338
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,891
人家会以为你是我父亲！
Anybody'd think you was my father!

339
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:55,400
如果我决定要教你 我会比你父亲还严厉两倍
lf I decide to teach you, I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

340
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,427
拿去
Here.

341
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:58,763
这干什么？
What 's this for?

342
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:02,536
擦眼泪 将脸上所有的泪水擦干净
To wipe your eyes To wipe any part of your face that feels mois

343
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,473
记住这是手帕那是袖子
Remember, that 's your handkerchief and that 's your sleeve.

344
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,141
如果你想当专柜小姐 就别弄混了
Don't confuse the one with the other if you want to become a lady in a shop.

345
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:13,244
跟她说这个没用，席根斯先生 她不明白的
lt's no use to talk to her like that , Mr. Higgins She doesn 't understand you.

346
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:16,619
把手帕给我 他是给我又不是给你
'Ere! Give the 'ankerchief to me . He give it to me , not to you!

347
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,217
席根斯，我很感兴趣
Higgins, I'm interested.

348
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:23,559
你说过的可以训练她 像女公爵般出席大使舞会
What about your boast ..that you could pass her of as a duchess at the Embassy Ball?

349
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,293
如果你办到了 我会说你是世上最伟大的老师
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you do that .

350
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:30,633
我赌所有的实验费用 你办不到的
I'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can' t do it

351
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:32,634
我会付学费
I'll even pay for the lessons

352
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,471
你人真好，谢谢，长官
Aw, you're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n .

353
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,870
这真是无法抗拒
lt's almost irresistible.

354
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:45,475
她低俗的如此有趣 真是脏死了
She's so deliciously low.
So horribly dirty .

355
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:49,114
我很干净 我洗了脸洗了手才来的
lain't dirty ! I washed my face an' hands before I come , I did.

356
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,149
我接受 我会让她彻底的改头换面
I'll take it I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

357
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:57,055
我们从现在开始，皮尔斯太太 带她下去把她弄干净
We'll start today . This moment Take her away , Mrs Pearce, and clean her.

358
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,566
如果洗不干净用砂纸 厨房有炉火吗？
Sandpaper, if it won't come of any other way . ls there a fire in the kitchen?

359
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,695
把她衣服烧了 叫人买些新衣来
Take all her clothes of and burn them and order some new ones

360
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:06,501
先用纸把她包起来 直到买回来为止
Just wrap her in brown paper till they come .

361
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:12,072
你真不绅士，竟说这种话 我是个好女孩
You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk o' such things I'm a good girl, I am .

362
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,978
我知道你是那种人，真的
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

363
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,949
我们不要你假正经，年轻女孩
We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman.

364
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,350
你是学变成一位女公爵
You've got to learn to behave like a duchess .

365
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:24,892
带她走，皮尔斯太太 如果她找麻烦就打她
Take 'er away , Mrs Pearce, an'if she gives you any trouble wallop 'er.

366
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,790
我会报警的
I'll call the police, I will.

367
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,487
但我没有地方可以安置她
I've got no place to put her.

368
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:30,291
把她放到垃圾桶里
Well, put her in the dustbin.

369
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,491
拜托，席根斯，讲理一点
Come , Higgins, be reasonable.

370
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:38,868
你得讲理一点，席根斯先生 你不能这样践踏人！
You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins, really you mus You can' t walk over everybody like this

371
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,138
我？践踏别人？
l?
Walk over everybody?

372
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:49,410
亲爱的皮尔斯太太，平克林 我并无意要践踏别人
My dear Mrs Pearce, my dear Pickering, I had no intention of walking over anyone.

373
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,577
我只是建议 我们要对这女孩仁慈点
lmerely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.

374
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:57,349
我没说清楚 那是我不想伤害她小小的心灵
l didn't express myself clearly because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

375
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,884
或是你们的
or yours

376
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:02,121
但是，先生 你不能对一个女孩这样
But, sir, you can' t take a girl up like that ...

377
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,824
好像是你从沙滩边 检回来的石头
as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.

378
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,195
为何不能？
Why not

379
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:09,065
为何不能？你对她一无所知
Why not But you don't know anything about her.

380
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,071
她的父母是谁？也许她结过婚
What about her parents ? She may be married.

381
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,538
格恩！
Garn!

382
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,939
这是这女孩常说的“格恩”！
There. As the girl very properly says, garn!

383
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:19,409
谁会和我结婚？
Who'd marry me ?

384
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,513
天啊，伊莱莎…
By George, Eliza ..

385
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:31,748
在我造就你之前 外面的人宁愿自杀也要避开你
the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men...
shooting themselves for your sake before I've done with you.

386
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:35,261
我要走了
'Ere.
I'm goin'.

387
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:39,090
他是个白痴 我不要这个疯子教我
He's of his chump , he is I don't want no balmies teachin' me .

388
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,328
疯子？好，皮尔斯太太 不必为她买新衣了
Mad , am l? All right, Mrs Pearce, don't order those new clothes

389
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,632
把她赶出去！ 席根斯先生，我不同意这样
-Throw her out -Stop, Mr. Higgins I won't allow it

390
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,206
回到你父母身边去，女孩
Go home to your parents , girl.

391
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:48,172
我没有父母
lain't got no parents .

392
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,267
她没有父母，干嘛大惊小怪？
She ain't got no parents . What 's the fuss about

393
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,677
没人要她，她对别人没用 但对我有用，带她上楼去
Nobody wants her. She's no use to anybody but me . Take her upstairs

394
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,250
她会变得如何？ 你要付钱给她吗？
What 's to become of her? ls she to be paid anything?

395
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,319
哦，先生，明智一点
Oh, do be sensible, sir.

396
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,151
她要钱干嘛？她衣食充足 如果给她钱她会去喝酒的
What would she do with money? She'll have food and clothes
She'll only drink if you give her money.

397
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:06,785
你真粗鲁，这是谎言 我从不喝酒的
You are a brute ! lt's a lie!
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me .

398
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:09,955
先生，你是绅士 别让他如此藐视我！
Sir, you're a gentleman. Don't let 'im speak to me like that !

399
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:12,999
你感觉到了吗？ 席根斯，她有感情的
Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feelings

400
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:16,201
不，我不认为 我们不必担心她的感受
No, I don't think so . No feelings we need worry about

401
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,729
你有吗，伊莱莎？
Well, have you, Eliza

402
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,171
我和别人一样有情感
l got me feelings same as anyone else .

403
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,767
席根斯先生 我想知道这女孩在这里的条件
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms the girl is to be here.

404
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,039
当你教完之后，她该怎么办？
What 's to become of her when you've finished your teaching?

405
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,978
你必须先想好，先生？
You must look ahead a little, sir.

406
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:31,313
如果她还生活在贫民窟 会是怎么样，皮尔斯太太？
What 's to become of her if we leave her in the gutter, Mrs Pearce?

407
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,717
那是她的自己事，不是你的事 席根斯先生
That 's her own business , not yours, Mr. Higgins

408
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,449
我教完了她就回贫民窟
When I'm done we'll throw her back.

409
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:38,549
那又是为她的自己事 就没有关系了
Then it'll be her own business again. That 'll be all right, won't it

410
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,527
你真的是无情无义！
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya

411
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:44,129
你除了自己之外 其他的都不关心
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

412
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:48,732
我受够了，我真的要走了 你该为自己感到羞耻
I've 'ad enough of this I'm goin', I am !
You ought to be ashamed of yourself

413
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,668
吃点巧克力，伊莱莎
Have some chocolates, Eliza

414
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,207
我怎么知道这里面有什么？
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em

415
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:02,215
我听说很多女孩都因此受骗
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged by the likes o' you.

416
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,182
我保证
Pledge of good faith .

417
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:06,611
我吃一半
I'll take one half.

418
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:08,979
你吃另一半
And you take the other.

419
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,561
你每天都会有 好几个盒巧克力可以吃
You'll have boxes of them barrels of them every day .

420
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,529
你可以三餐都吃
You'll live on them eh?

421
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:22,834
我不会这样吃 除非我需要才会吃它
l wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too laidylike to take it out o' me mouth .

422
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:29,240
想想看，伊莱莎 巧克力和车子还有黄金，钻石
Think of it, Eliza Think of chocolates, and taxis ..and gold and diamonds

423
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:34,243
我不要黄金和钻石 我是个好女孩
l don't want no gold and no diamonds I'm a good girl, I am .

424
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:38,107
席根斯，我必须要说 皮尔斯太太说的非常对
Higgins, I really must interfere. Mrs Pearce is quite right

425
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,519
如果这女孩 要参与你的六个月实验
lf this girI's going to put herself in your hands for six months ..for an experiment in teaching, 

426
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:45,092
她一定要完全了解她在作什么
she must understand thoroughly what she's doing.

427
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:56,198
伊莱莎，你今后这六个月 住在这学习像淑女般地说话
You are to stay here for the next six months ..
learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florist shop.

428
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:00,902
如果你很乖，照我的话做 你会有很舒适的卧房可以睡
lf you're good and do what you're told, you shall sleep in a proper bedroom. ..

429
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:05,309
有很多东西吃 有钱买巧克力还车子可以坐
have lots to eat , money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis

430
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:11,748
但是如果你顽皮，懒惰 你在厨房跟蟑螂睡
But if you are naughty and idle...you shall sleep in the kitchen amongst the black beetles ..

431
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,720
并被皮尔斯太太用扫把打
and be walloped by Mrs Pearce with a broomstick.

432
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:23,926
六个月后，你就会坐着马车 穿着漂亮衣服去白金汉宫
At the end of six months, you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

433
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:27,024
如果国王发现你不是淑女
lf the King finds out that you are not a lady...

434
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:31,401
警察会抓你去伦敦塔 把你的头砍掉
the police will take you to the Tower of London where your head will be cut of ...

435
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:34,475
用来警告其他傲慢的卖花女
as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls

436
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:38,309
但是如果你没被发现 你会有礼物
But if you are not found out you shall have a present of. ..

437
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:43,245
会有机会成为 从事花店生意的淑女
seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop.

438
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:50,548
如果你拒绝 你就是个薄情的讨厌女孩
lf you refuse this ofer...you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl...

439
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,586
天使也会为你悲叹！
and the angels will weep for you!

440
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,259
满意了吗，平克林？
Now are you satisfied, Pickering?

441
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,200
我不知道你在说些什么
l don't understand what you are talking about

442
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,738
要我再进一步说明吗 皮尔斯太太？
Could I put it more plainly or fairly, Mrs Pearce?

443
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,738
跟我来，伊莱沙

这样就对了，带她去浴室
That 's right Bundle her of to the bathroom.

445
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:12,009
你很会欺负人！
You're a great bully, you are!

446
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,842
只要我不高兴我就走人 我不要让别人打我！
l won't stay here if I don't like it I won't let nobody wallop me !

447
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,280
别顶嘴了，女孩
Don't answer back, girl.

448
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:20,150
早知如此我不该来这里 我是个好女孩
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

449
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:22,154
不要打我

451
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,751
我就会带她到各处去 训练她所有的礼仪
I'll take her anywhere and I'll pass her of as anything.

452
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:30,626
我要把不幸的野蛮人变成女王
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

453
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:41,139
我这一生从未洗过澡 没洗过你们那种澡
I've never had a bath in me life . Not what you'd call a proper one.

454
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:44,507
如果外表不干净 内在就无法成为真正的淑女
You know you can' t be a nice girl inside if you're dirty outside.

455
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,413
我将你安置在这里 这是你的卧房
I'll have to put you in here. This will be your bedroom.

456
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,817
哦，我不能睡在这里，小姐
Oh, I couldn't sleep in here, Missus

457
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,856
这房间对我来说太好了
lt's too good for the likes o' me .

458
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,086
我不敢碰任何东西
lshould be afraid to touch anythin'.

459
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,095
毕竟我现在还不是女公爵
lain't a duchess yet, you know.

460
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,272
这是什么？洗衣服的吗？
What 's this This where you wash clothes

461
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,900
这是我们洗澡用的，伊莱沙 我正要给你洗澡
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza And where I'm going to wash you.

462
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:21,448
你要我在里面洗澡？我不干！
You expect me to get into that and wet meself all over?Not me !

463
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,880
除非我死了
lshall catch me death.

464
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,352
来吧
Come along now.

465
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:35,095
来吧
Come along.

466
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,229
把衣服脱了
Take your clothes of .

467
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,468
快点，你听到了，脱掉衣服 来，帮我脱掉…
Come on, girl, do as you're told. Take your clothes of .Here, come on. Help me take these ....

468
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:53,036
我不要…不要碰我！
Take your hands of me !

469
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:58,284
放开我

470
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:13,164
不…不要

471
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,963
我是个好女孩！
I'm a good girl, I am !

472
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,839
这样不对！…
lt ain't right lt ain't decent

473
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:28,842
不要碰我！
Get your hands off me!

474
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:38,825
我是个好女孩！
I'm a good girl, I am!

475
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,575
原谅我的无礼，席根斯 我参予此事就要为那女孩负责
Forgive the bluntness , but if I'm to be in this business ...I shall feel responsible for the girl.

476
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:01,375
我希望你非常清楚 不能占这女孩的便宜！
l hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.

477
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,144
那种事情？我可以保证
What , that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

478
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:07,244
拜托，席根斯 这可不是开玩笑的
Come now, you know what I mea This is no trifling matter.

479
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:10,882
好的男人总是会吸引女人的
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

480
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:15,058
你遇到过这样的女人吗？
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

481
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,188
是的，常常碰到
Yes, very frequently.

482
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:20,664
我没有，我发现当一个女人 和我作朋友后
l haven't I find that the moment I let a woman make friends with me ...

483
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:25,330
她就会变得嫉妒，兴奋 多疑，讨人厌
she becomes jealous, exacting...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

484
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,701
当我和女人作朋友后 我就变得自私专制
lfind the moment that I make friends with a woman I become selfish and tyrannical .

485
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,177
所以我现在还是一个老光棍 而且想一直这样下去
So here I am , a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so .

486
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,672
毕竟，平克林…
Well, after all, Pickering--

487
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:40,347
我只是个普通人，什么也不求
I'm an ordinary manWho desires nothing more

488
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,681
只求有个机会
Than just an ordinary chance

489
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,386
过他喜欢的生活方式 做他想作的事
To live exactly as he likesAnd do precisely what he wants

490
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:49,622
我是一个很普通的人
An average man am l

491
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,698
不会离经叛道
Of no eccentric whim

492
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,556
喜欢过自己的生活
Who likes to live his life

493
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:55,163
自由地争论
Free of strife

494
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,238
照他自己的想法去做
Doing whatever he thinks is best for him

495
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,706
哦，我只是个普通人

只要一点点
With a little bit

627
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:51,699
只要一点点好运气！
With a little bit o'bloomin'luck!

628
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,238
哦，男人风流是罪恶的
Oh, it's a crime for a man To go philanderin'

629
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:06,714
害可怜的太太悲痛忧伤
And fill his wife's poor 'eart With grief and doubt

630
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:14,853
哦，男人风流是项罪恶 但只要一点点运气…
Oh, it's a crime for a man To go philanderin', but
With a little bit o'luck With a little bit o'luck

631
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:18,222
太太永远不会发现！
You can see the bloodhounds Don't find out!

632
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,725
只要一点点
With a little bit

633
00:50:20,968 --> 00:50:22,458
只要一点点
With a little bit

634
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:25,700
只要一点点运气 太太永远不会发现！
With a little bit o'luck She won't find out!

635
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:30,373
只要一点点

636
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:34,379
只要一点点好运气！
With a little bit o'bloomin'luck!

637
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:41,985
只要一点点好运气！

638
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,056
邮件，先生
The mail, sir.

639
00:50:51,432 --> 00:50:53,764
把帐单付了 然后回拒所有的邀请
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations

640
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,871
你不能对女孩这样做
You simply cannot go on working the girl this way .

641
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:47,147
要她一直练习 每天从早到晚都在语言练习
Making her say her alphabet over and over...from sunup to sundown, even during meals

642
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:49,814
你会累坏，何时可以停下来？
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

643
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:53,120
等她发音正确为止 还有事吗，皮尔斯太太？
When she does it properly, of course . ls that all, Mrs Pearce?

644
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,093
这封信是美国百万富翁 以斯拉寄来的
There's another letter from that Americanillionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

645
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,392
他还是希望你 为道德改革会工作
He still wants you for his Moral Reform League.

646
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,558
把它丢了
Throw it away .

647
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:04,125
这是第三封了 至少你该回封信吧
lt's the third letter he's written you, sir. You should at least answer it

648
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:06,866
好，放在书桌上，皮尔斯太太 我会试着回信
All right, leave it on the des , Mrs Pearce. I'll try an' get to it

649
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:14,371
如果可以，先生 楼下有清洁工亚尔杜立特尔
lf you please, sir. There's a dustma downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

650
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:17,450
想要见你 他说他的女儿在这里
who wants to see you. He says you have his daughter here.

651
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:18,710
去！我说！
Phew! I say!

652
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,611
叫那个无赖上来，亚当
Well, send the blackguard up.

653
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:24,055
他可能不是无赖，席根斯
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins

654
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,819
哦，他毫无疑问地是无赖 平克林
Oh, nonsense . O' course he's a blackguard, Pickering.

655
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:29,293
我怕他是来找麻烦的
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble with him.

656
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,230
不，不会的 是我找他麻烦不是他找我
No, I think not Any trouble to be had , he'll have it with me . Not I with him.

657
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:38,570
这位是杜立特尔，先生
Doolittle, sir.

658
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:47,173
席根斯教授？ 在这里！
-Professor 'lggins -Here!

659
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,272
在哪里？
Where?

660
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,715
早安，先生
Good morning, Governor.

661
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:55,213
我是为一件重要的事而来 先生
l come about a very serious matter, Governor.

662
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:00,718
在宏士罗洛长大的
Brought up in Houndslow.

663
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:03,226
我想你母亲是威尔斯人
Mother Welsh , I should think.

664
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:05,888
你要干什么？杜立特尔先生
What is it you want , Doolittle?

665
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:08,399
我要我女儿，懂吗？
l want my daughter, that 's what I want . See?

666
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:11,126
你当然是要你女儿 你是她父亲，对吧？
Of course you do. You're her father, aren't you?

667
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:13,832
我很高兴你对家人还有感情
I'm glad to see you have a spark of family feeling left .

668
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,569
她在里面，可以马上带她走
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

669
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:17,767
什么？
What ?

670
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:21,975
把她带走，我才不替你养女儿
Take her away . Do you think I am going to keep your daughter for you?

671
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,146
这样合理吗？
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

672
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:28,345
这样占一个人便宜公平吗？
ls it fairity to take advantage of a man like that ?

673
00:53:28,522 --> 00:53:31,787
这女孩属于我，你却得到她 我该怎么办？
The girl belongs to me . You got 'er. Where do I come in?

674
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:35,922
你竟然敢来这里企图勒索我！
How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me !

675
00:53:36,496 --> 00:53:38,088
你故意送她到这里来！
You sent her here on purpose !

676
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,898
别这样刁难人，先生
Don't take a man up like that , Governor.

677
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:46,665
警察应该逮捕你 这是个勒索计划
The police shall take you up. This is a pla ..a plot to extort money by threats

678
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:48,434
我应该打电话报警
lshall telephone the police.

679
00:53:48,842 --> 00:53:51,834
我有向你要钱了吗？
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

680
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:55,611
我们可以问这位先生 我提到了钱吗？
l leave it to this gentleman 'ere. Have I said a word about money?

681
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,984
那你来干什么？
Well, what else did you come for?

682
00:54:00,087 --> 00:54:04,353
我能干什么 有点人情味嘛，先生
What would a bloke come for? Be 'uman, Governor.

683
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:12,432
亚尔，你故意把她送来这里
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose .

684
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:14,193
拜托，先生，我从未这样做
So help me , Governor, I never did.

685
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:15,495
那你怎么知道她在这里？
Then how did you know she was here?

686
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:18,537
我正要告诉你，先生 如果你让我说的话
I'd tell you, Governor, if you'd only let me get a word in.

687
00:54:18,772 --> 00:54:23,800
我会告诉你，我要告诉你 我等着要告诉你！
I'm willing to tell ya I'm wanting to tell ya
I'm waiting to tell ya

688
00:54:25,379 --> 00:54:29,247
平克林 这就是特定的自然修辞法
You know, Pickering, this chap 's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

689
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,551
注意他说话的原始韵律
Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.

690
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,653
“我会告诉你，我要告诉你 我等着要告诉你”
''I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.''

691
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,018
他说的是威尔斯腔调
That 's the Welsh strain in 'im.

692
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:41,884
如果不是你叫伊莱莎来 你怎么知道她在这里？
How did you know Eliza was here if you didn't send 'er?

693
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:45,453
她叫人回来拿她的行李 而我碰巧听到了
Well, she sent back for her luggage and I got to 'ear about it

694
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,295
她说她不要衣服了
She said she didn't want no clothes

695
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:53,737
我会怎么想？我问你 我是父亲，我该怎么想？
What was I to think from that , Governor? lask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

696
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:57,875
所以你是来这里救她的？
So you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?

697
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,545
是的，先生，没错 是
-Yes, sir, Governor. That 's right -Yes

698
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:02,413
皮尔斯太太！
Mrs Pearce!

699
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:03,873
皮尔斯太太
Eliza' s father has come to take her away . Give her to him will you?

700
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:07,283
伊莱沙的父亲来带她了 把她交给他，好吗？

701
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,788
等一下，先生，等一下
Now wait a minute , Governor. Wait a minute .

702
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:14,420
你和我都是这世上的男人吧 不是吗？
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

703
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:18,989
这世上的男人吧，是吗？ 皮尔太太你最好快走
Men of the world, are we? Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs Pearce.

704
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,589
我也是这么想，先生！
lthink so indeed, sir!

705
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:25,864
先生，我对你很有好感…
Here, Governor.I've took a sort of a fancy to you and ...

706
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:32,542
如果你要这个女孩 我就不带她走了…
if you want the girl, I ain't so set on 'avin' her back home again...

707
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:35,581
但是我有些事情要解决
but what I might be open to is an arrangement

708
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:38,416
我所要求的是父亲的权利
All I ask is my rights as a father.

709
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:42,147
你一定不希望我 毫无代价地就让她离开我
You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.

710
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:45,720
我看得出你是很正直的人 先生
l can see you're o' the straight sort, Governor.

711
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:47,020
所以…
So...

712
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:50,927
5英镑对你有无差吧 伊莱莎对我也无差
what 's a five pound note to you? An' what 's Eliza to me ?

713
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,226
我想你应该知道，杜立特尔…
lthink you ought to know, Doolittle...

714
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,359
席根斯先生的用意是很崇高的
that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable.

715
00:55:56,903 --> 00:56:00,737
当然，先生 否则我要50英镑
Of course they are, Governor. lf I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

716
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:04,074
你是说你用50英镑卖女儿？
Do you mean to say you'd sell your daughter for 50 pounds

717
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:05,906
你没道德良心吗？
Have you no morals, man?

718
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,749
如果你跟我一样穷 你也会没有的，先生
No, I can' t afford 'em Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me .

719
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:15,281
我没有恶意，但…
Not that I mean any 'arm mind ya, but ..

720
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:18,949
如果伊莱沙可以 为何我不可以呢？
if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this, why not me , too?

721
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,252
为何？
Why not

722
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,794
那么…
Well, look....

723
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,826
用我的观点来看 我算什么了？
Look at it my way . What am l?

724
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:31,762
我问你我算什么？ 我是毫无价值的穷人，就是我
lask ya, what am l? I'm one o' the undeserving poor, that 's what I am .

725
00:56:31,872 --> 00:56:33,863
想想看这对人的意义
Now think what that means to a man.

726
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,671
意思是他一生都在对抗 中等阶级的道德观
lt means he's up agains middle-class morality for all the time .

727
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:42,009
如果任何情况发生了 永远都会有一样结果
lf there's anything goin' an' I puts in for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

728
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:44,345
你没有价值，所以不能给你
''You're undeservin', so you can' t have it ''

729
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:49,077
但我需要的钱 和寡妇需要的是一样
But my needs is as great as the mos deservin' widows that ever got money...

730
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:53,387
她是从过世的丈夫身分 得来的救济金
out of six diferent charities in one week for the death o' the same 'usband .

731
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:57,286
我需要的不比别人少 我需要的更多
l don't need less than a deservin' man, I need more.

732
00:56:57,764 --> 00:57:00,756
我吃的不少，并且爱喝酒…
l don't eat less 'earty than he does and I drink...

733
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:02,661
喝很多
a lot more.

734
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:04,798
我就跟你直话直说
I'm playin' straight with you.

735
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,903
我不打算假装我应得 不，我是不应该这样
lain't pretendin' to be deservin'. No, I'm undeservin'...

736
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,031
而我就是没有价值 我喜欢，这是事实
And I mean to go on bein' undeservin'. I like it an' that 's the truth.

737
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:16,999
但是你会占人便宜吗…
But will you take advantage of a man's nature...

738
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:23,243
我好不容易把她扶养长大 为她做了一切…
do him out of the price of his own daughter, what he's brought up...
fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow...

739
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:28,879
直到现在 她大到可以吸引你们两位
till she's growed big enough to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

740
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,121
5英镑不合理吗，看你们了？
Is five pounds unreasonable, I put it to you?

741
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:36,152
我把问题交给你
And I leave it to you.

742
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:42,558
平克林 如果我们若训练他三个月…
You know, Pickering, if we took this man in hand for three months...

743
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,535
他就能在内阁或教区间 选个职位
he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales

744
00:57:47,472 --> 00:57:51,203
我们最好给他5英镑 他会滥用这些钱
- We'd better give 'im a fiver. - He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

745
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,334
不会的，先生，相信我不会
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't

746
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:55,935
这只是我和内人喝酒的钱…
Just one good spree for meself an' the missus...

747
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,982
带给自己欢乐 和别人工作的机会
givin' pleasure to ourselves and employment to others

748
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,810
你该满意钱不会被浪费 这是最好的选择
An' satisfaction to you to know it ain't been throwed away.You couldn't spend it better.

749
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:06,219
哦，真难拒绝 给他10英镑好了
Oh, this is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

750
00:58:06,324 --> 00:58:07,222
不行

751
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:09,259
内人不知道要如何花10英镑 先生
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart to spend ten, Governor.

752
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,021
10英镑太多了
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

753
00:58:11,129 --> 00:58:14,690
那会让人审慎考虑 不再快乐了
Makes a man feel prudent-like, and then goodbye to 'appiness.

754
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:18,933
你只要给我5英镑，不多不少
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor. Not a penny less, not a penny more.

755
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:22,536
我很想插手管这件不道德的事 杜立特尔
I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

756
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,699
你为何不跟她结婚呢？
Why don't you marry that missus of yours

757
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:28,108
毕竟婚姻不可怕 何况你和伊莱沙母亲结过婚
After all, marriage isn 't so frightening. You married Eliza' s mother.

758
00:58:28,312 --> 00:58:29,904
谁说的，先生？
Who told you that, Governor?

759
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:32,847
没人告诉我是 是我自己想到的…
Well, nobody told me. I concluded, naturally...

760
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:40,116
如果他再说一分钟 我们就没有信心了
If we listen to this man for another minute we shall have no convictions left.

761
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:43,125
你说的5英镑 谢谢，先生
- Five pounds, I think you said. - Thank you, Governor.

762
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,692
确定不要10英镑？
Are you sure you won't have ten?

763
00:58:44,796 --> 00:58:47,094
不…或许下次好了
No. No, perhaps another time.

764
00:58:49,033 --> 00:58:50,261
对不起，小姐
I beg your pardon, Miss.

765
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:53,132
我不要再说这些母音了
I won't say those ruddy vowels one more time.

766
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:54,864
我的天啊，是伊莱莎
Blimey, it's Eliza

767
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:57,733
我从不知道她弄干净之后 会这么漂亮
Well, I never thought she'd clean up so good-looking.

768
00:58:57,842 --> 00:58:59,833
真是我的光荣，不是吗，先生
She does me credit, don't she, Governor?

769
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:02,435
等等，你来这里干什么？
Here! What are you doin' here?

770
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:07,007
你不要说了，别让他们看笑话
Now, you hold your tongue and don't you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

771
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:10,885
如果她惹了什么麻烦 只要剥掉她的衣服就好
If you have any trouble with 'er, give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

772
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:13,286
那就会督促她
That 's the way to improve 'er mind.

773
00:59:13,558 --> 00:59:16,083
早安，各位，再见，伊莱莎
Well, good morning, gentlemen. Cheerio, Eliza

774
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:23,661
这人很会说话，天分很高
There's a man for you. A philosophical genius of the first water.

775
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:27,495
皮尔斯太太 写信给以拉斯先生告诉他…
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford and tell him...

776
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,904
如果他要找人演讲 请他找亚尔杜立特尔
if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

777
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:33,909
一位普通的清洁工 说他是英国最好的道德家之一
a common dustman, one o' the most original moralists in England.

778
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:34,705
是的

779
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:37,037
他来干嘛？
'Ere, what did he come for?

780
00:59:37,148 --> 00:59:38,137
去念你的母音
Say your vowels

781
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:40,274
我早知道那些母音了
I know me vowels I knew 'em before I come.

782
00:59:40,384 --> 00:59:41,681
如果你知道你念出来呀
If you know them say them.

783
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:44,846
Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.

784
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:48,121
A, E, I, O, U.

785
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,460
我是这么说的啊…
That 's what I said. Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.

786
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:54,156
我已经说了三天 我不想再说了
That 's what I been sayin' for three days an'I won't say 'em no more.

787
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:57,257
我知道这很难，杜立特尔小姐 但请试着了解
I know it's dificult, Miss Doolittle, but try to understand.

788
00:59:57,702 --> 01:00:00,899
不需要解释 身为军人你该了解
There's no use explaining. As a military man you ought to know that.

789
01:00:01,005 --> 01:00:04,941
她需要训练 你不要管她，不必同情她
Drilling is what she needs
Leave her alone or she'll be turning to you for sympathy.

790
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:08,136
好吧，席根斯，这需要耐心
Very well, if you insis but have a little patience with her.

791
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:09,440
当然
Of course.

792
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:11,480
念“A”
Say "A."

793
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,777
你真没良心
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't

794
01:00:20,057 --> 01:00:25,552
伊莱莎 我相信你今天会念好的…
I promise you you'll say your vowels correctly before this day is out...

795
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:30,691
否则没有午餐 晚餐和巧克力吃
or there'll be no lunch, no dinner, and no chocolates

796
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:45,074
等着看，席根斯，等着看
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait

797
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:49,318
你会后悔 但你流泪也来不及了
You'll be sorry But your tears will be too late

798
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:54,881
你会破产，我有钱也不借你 要我帮你？别指望！
You'll be broke and I'll have money Will I help you? Don't be funny!

799
01:00:54,992 --> 01:00:58,189
等着看，席根斯，等着看
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait

800
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:02,694
等着看，席根斯，等你生病时
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Till you're sick

801
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:07,200
你会大叫要我赶快去请医生
And you screams To fetch a doctor double-quick

802
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:13,105
我会马上走开，上街去看戏
I'll be off a second later And go straight to the theater

803
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:16,179
啊哈，席根斯，等着看
Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait!

804
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:21,908
席根斯

805
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:25,682
等到我们在海中游泳时
Just you wait Until we're swimmin'in the sea

806
01:01:26,824 --> 01:01:30,487
席根斯

807
01:01:30,594 --> 01:01:34,086
你在我伸手可及的地方抽筋
And you get the cramp A little ways from me

808
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:39,333
当你要溺死前大叫救命时 我立刻上岸穿衣进城玩乐
When you yell you're gonna drown I'll get dressed and go to town

809
01:01:39,437 --> 01:01:41,530
哈哈哈，席根斯

810
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,199
哈哈哈，席根斯

811
01:01:44,308 --> 01:01:47,141
我们等着看！
Just you wait!

812
01:01:50,848 --> 01:01:56,343
有一天，我会成名 有教养又高尚
One day I'll be famous I'll be proper and prim

813
01:01:56,454 --> 01:02:01,414
时常上圣杰姆斯教堂 因而称它为圣杰姆
Go to St. James so often I will call it St. Jim

814
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:07,754
在一晚，国王会对我说 伊莱沙，老朋友
One evening the King will say "Oh, Liza, old thing

815
01:02:07,865 --> 01:02:14,100
我要全英格兰为你而歌唱
"I want all of England Your praises to sing

816
01:02:14,238 --> 01:02:18,732
下星期，五月二十日
"Next week on the 20th of May

817
01:02:18,843 --> 01:02:23,780
我宣布为伊莱沙杜立特尔日
"I proclaim Liza Doolittle Day

818
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:29,148
全民会为你的荣耀而庆祝
"All the people will celebrate The glory of you

819
01:02:29,253 --> 01:02:34,748
不论你希望什么，或要什么 我都很高兴替你办
"And whatever you wish and want I gladly will do"

820
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:40,957
谢谢你，吾王 我会非常有教养的说
"Thanks a lot, King," says I In a manner well-bred

821
01:02:41,065 --> 01:02:46,059
我只要亨利席根斯的人头
"But all I want is 'Enry 'lggins' 'ead"

822
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:48,029
就这么办！
"Done!"

823
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,334
国王马上就说了
Says the King with a stroke

824
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:54,934
卫兵们，赶快逮捕那家伙归案
"Guard, run and bring in the bloke"

825
01:02:56,347 --> 01:03:00,113
然后卫兵就会押着你来到刑场
Then they'll march you, 'Enry 'lggins To the wall

826
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:02,946
国王告诉我
And the King will tell me

827
01:03:03,054 --> 01:03:05,147
伊莱沙，发号施令
"Liza, sound the call"

828
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:09,026
当他们高举步枪
As they raise their rifles higher

829
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,755
我喊着：准备，瞄准，射击！
I'll shout: "Ready, aim, fire!"

830
01:03:14,698 --> 01:03:20,136
啊哈哈，亨利席根斯，死得好
Ho, ho, ho, 'Enry 'lggins Down you go

831
01:03:20,237 --> 01:03:23,138
我们等着看！
Just you wait!

832
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:04,643
好了，伊莱沙，再说一遍
All right, Eliza, say it again.

833
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:11,283
斯般牙的鱼大多数刺在瓶员上
"The rine in Spine..."stais minely in the pline."

834
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:15,889
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."

835
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:17,453
我不是这么“塞”的吗？
Didn't I saiy that?

836
01:04:17,561 --> 01:04:20,724
不，伊莱沙，你没“塞” 你根本不会“说”
No, Eliza, you didn't "saiy" that. You didn't even "say" that.

837
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:26,061
你每晚上床睡觉前 你就祷告说
Every night before you get into bed, where you used to say your prayers...I want you to say:

838
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,537
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."

839
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,800
50遍
Fifty times

840
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:35,108
你会更接近上帝的 因为他会被你吵死
You'll get much further with the Lord if you learn not to ofend His ears

841
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,645
现在练习你的“H”
Now for your "H's"

842
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:40,917
平克林，你会被气死
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

843
01:04:41,018 --> 01:04:43,213
耐心点，席根斯 给这孩子一个机会
Control yourself Higgins Give the girl a chance.

844
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,050
我想你无法期待她 第一次就办得到
Isuppose you can' t expect her to get it right the first time.

845
01:04:46,157 --> 01:04:48,182
来，伊莱沙，注意看
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

846
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,322
看见火火焰了吗？
Now, you see that flame?

847
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,390
你发音正确时这火焰会升起
Every time you pronounce the letter "H" correctly the flame will waver...

848
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:01,562
如果错了，这火焰就不会动
and every time you drop your "H" the flame will remain stationary.

849
01:05:01,672 --> 01:05:03,162
这样就知道是否正确
That 's how to know you've done it correctly.

850
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,139
同时你会听到不同的地方
In time, your ear will hear the diference.

851
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:08,871
你看镜子里面的火焰 注意听了
You'll see it better in the mirror. Now listen carefully.

852
01:05:09,813 --> 01:05:12,907
在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

853
01:05:13,184 --> 01:05:16,278
没有发生飓风
"hurricanes hardly ever happen."

854
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:19,652
跟着我念
Now you repeat that after me.

855
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:23,690
在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡，没有发生飓风
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."

856
01:05:23,994 --> 01:05:28,897
在喝特福特，呵里福 和含普郡，没有花生居风
"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire 'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen."

857
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:30,694
哦，不，不是！
Oh, no, no, no!

858
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:32,631
你都没在听吗？
Have you no ear at all?

859
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,829
要再一次吗？ 不要了
- Should I do it over? - No, please.

860
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,800
从头开始，像这样
Start from the very beginning. Just do this

861
01:05:47,518 --> 01:05:49,179
继续…
Go on, go on, go on.

862
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,320
这和印度语言发音是一样吗？
Does the same thing hold true in India

863
01:05:55,392 --> 01:05:58,452
他们也把多余的音省略 像H音就省略
Have they the peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter...

864
01:05:58,562 --> 01:06:01,861
但是用到不该用的地方 很多就错了
but using it where it doesn 't belong, like "hever" instead of "ever"?

865
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,835
他们不明白发音倾向常发错音

866
01:06:08,939 --> 01:06:12,602
很多都不对 常把“歌唱者”的音念错

867
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:17,977
这和开始学发音的方法有关吧

868
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,082
那女孩，席根斯！
The girl, Higgins

869
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,386
继续…
Go on. Go on.

870
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,194
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

871
01:06:34,598 --> 01:06:37,567
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

872
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:43,102
早晚都在工作
Night and day he slaves away

873
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:47,437
哦，可怜的席根斯教授
Oh, poor Professor Higgins

874
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:57,276
从早到晚在马不停蹄的工作
All day long on his feetUp and down until he's numb

875
01:06:57,821 --> 01:07:04,954
从不休息…手忙到麻木
Doesn't rest, doesn't eatDoesn't touch a crumb

876
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:10,293
再一次，伊莱莎
Again, Eliza

877
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:13,502
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

878
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:17,438
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

879
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:20,066
不，你太好了…
No. Kind of you. Kind of you. Kind...

880
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:23,270
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

881
01:07:23,814 --> 01:07:26,806
“你让我来真是太好了”
How kind of you to let me come.

882
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,249
你太好了…像是一杯茶
Kind of you. Kind of you. It's like "cup of tea"

883
01:07:29,353 --> 01:07:31,878
你太好了…一杯茶，说一杯茶
Kind of you. Cup of tea Say, say "cup of tea"

884
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:33,378
一坏茶
Cuppatea

885
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:35,788
不是，一杯茶
No. "A cup of tea"

886
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:39,494
这些蛋糕真好吃 不知道皮尔斯太太哪里买的
It's awfully good cake. I wonder where Mrs Pearce gets it

887
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:44,857
一流的，草莓馅的真好吃 想吃一块吗？
First rate. And those strawberry tarts are delicious Did you try the pline cake?

888
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:51,971
再试一遍
Try it again.

889
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,043
你想试… 平克林！
- Did you try the... - Pickering!

890
01:07:55,612 --> 01:07:56,909
再试一遍，伊莱莎
Again, Eliza

891
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:58,241
一坏茶
Cuppatea

892
01:07:58,349 --> 01:07:59,407
哦，不
Oh, no.

893
01:07:59,983 --> 01:08:01,473
你难道不能分别不同的地方？
Can' t you hear the diference?

894
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:06,454
把舌放下，压到下方的牙齿
Look, put your tongue forward until it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

895
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,017
然后说，杯
And then say "cup."

896
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:10,650
杯
Then say "of."

897
01:08:10,761 --> 01:08:12,126
说，一

898
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:18,600
然后说，“一杯…”
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of of of of."

899
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:21,262
天啊，席根斯，这茶真好喝
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea

900
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:24,397
你把最后一块吃掉吧 我吃不下了
You finish the last strawberry tart I couldn't eat another thing.

901
01:08:24,508 --> 01:08:26,601
我不能吃了 浪费了可惜
- I couldn't touch it - Shame to waste it

902
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,579
哦，我不会浪费 我知道有人会喜欢草莓馅
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

903
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:45,126
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

904
01:08:45,963 --> 01:08:48,693
可怜的席根斯教授
Poor Professor Higgins

905
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,994
他总是辛勤的工作
On he plods against all odds

906
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:59,633
哦，可怜的席根斯教授
Oh, poor Professor Higgins

907
01:09:00,144 --> 01:09:04,547
晚上九点，晚上十点
Nine p.m., ten p. M.

908
01:09:04,648 --> 01:09:08,948
每晚都工作到午夜
On through midnight every night

909
01:09:09,052 --> 01:09:14,513
凌晨一点，凌晨二点，三点…
One a.m., two a.m., three...

910
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:17,059
Four.

911
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:19,059
Five.

912
01:09:20,097 --> 01:09:22,998
6颗
Six marbles

913
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:26,328
我要你念这个 我要你发出音来…
I want you to read this and I want you to enunciate...

914
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:29,873
假装嘴里没有东西念出来
every word just as if the marbles were not in your mouth.

915
01:09:30,941 --> 01:09:33,603
花盆里有着最黑的地衣
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

916
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,406
全部都有厚厚地外壳
"were thickly crusted, one and all."

917
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:39,448
清楚的念出每个字
Each word, clear as a bell.

918
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:43,452
花盆里有着最黑的…
"With blackest moss the flower...

919
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,748
地衣
"pots."

920
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:46,220
我不行！
I can' t

921
01:09:46,323 --> 01:09:47,483
我不行！
I can' t

922
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:50,754
席根斯，嘴里有必要含东西吗
Isay, Higgins, are those pebbles really necessary?

923
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:55,355
如果狄摩西尼斯这样做 伊莱沙就必须如此做
If they were necessary for Demosthenes they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

924
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:56,797
继续，伊莱莎
Go on, Eliza

925
01:09:57,201 --> 01:10:01,297
花盆里有着最黑的地衣…
"With the blackest moss the flower pots...

926
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,499
全部都有厚厚地外壳
"were thickly crusted one and all."

927
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:07,708
我一个字都听不懂
I can' t understand a word, not a word.

928
01:10:07,811 --> 01:10:10,780
花盆里有着最黑的地衣…
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

929
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:13,543
全部都有厚厚地外壳
"were thickly crusted, one and all."

930
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:16,445
或许这首诗太难了
Perhaps the poem is a little too dificult for the girl.

931
01:10:16,553 --> 01:10:20,011
为何不要她念些简单的文章
Why don't you try something simpler, like The Owl and the Pussycat?

932
01:10:20,123 --> 01:10:22,250
真是太可爱了
Yes, that 's a charming one.

933
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:25,485
平克林，我听不见她说的话！
Pickering, I can' t hear a word the girl is saying!

934
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:30,860
怎么了？
What 's the matter?

935
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,262
我吞了一个
Iswallowed one.

936
01:10:33,504 --> 01:10:37,338
没关系，还很多 张开嘴，1，2…
It doesn 't matter. I've got plenty more. Open your mouth. One, two...

937
01:10:39,943 --> 01:10:43,743
放弃吧，席根斯教授
Quit, Professor Higgins

938
01:10:43,847 --> 01:10:47,840
放弃吧，席根斯教授
Quit, Professor Higgins

939
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:53,287
听我们的请求 否则我们会辞职
Hear our plea, or payday we will quit

940
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:56,052
席根斯教授！
Professor Higgins!

941
01:10:56,193 --> 01:11:00,892
“艾”不是“爱” “哦”不是“欧”
"Ay"not "l", "O"not "ow"

942
01:11:00,998 --> 01:11:05,332
脑袋全都是回声
Pounding, pounding in our brain

943
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:09,838
“艾”不是“爱” “哦”不是“欧”
"Ay"not "I," "O"not "ow"

944
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,034
别说“鱼”要说“雨”
Don't say "rine" say "rain"

945
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:19,748
西班牙的雨…
"The rain in Spain...
"stays mainly in the plain."

946
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:24,014
不断落在原野上

947
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:30,651
我不行，我太累了！…
I can' t
I'm so tired!
I'm so tired.

948
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:36,131
天啊，席根斯 现是零晨三点，讲点道理
For God's sake, Higgins, it must be three o'clock in the morning.
Do be reasonable.

949
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,227
我一向都很讲理
Lam always reasonable.

950
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:46,142
伊莱莎，如果我可以忍受头痛 你也可以
Eliza, if I can go on with a blistering headache, you ca

951
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:49,305
但我头很痛
I got a 'eadache, too.

952
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:55,143
我知道你头痛，你累了
I know your head aches I know you're tired.

953
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:59,415
我知道你的神经紧张的 像是粘板上的肉
I know your nerves are as raw as meat in a butcher's window.

954
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,992
但是想想看你要完成的事情
But think what you're trying to accomplish.

955
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:08,693
想想你所要面对的事情
Just think what you're dealing with.

956
01:12:10,233 --> 01:12:16,138
庄严华丽的英语 是我们拥有最伟大的财产
The majesty and grandeur of the English language...It's the greatest possession we have.

957
01:12:16,907 --> 01:12:20,274
人们从内心传达出高贵思想
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed through the hearts of men...

958
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:26,839
是包含了不凡的想像力 和音乐混合的声音
are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative...and musical mixtures of sounds

959
01:12:28,352 --> 01:12:31,788
这就是你所要克服完成的 伊莱莎
And that 's what you've set yourself out to conquer, Eliza

960
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,484
克服它，你可以办到的
And conquer it you will.

961
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,048
现在再试一遍
Now try it again.

962
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:15,724
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
"The rain in Spain..."stays mainly in the plain."

963
01:13:17,801 --> 01:13:18,893
你说什么
What was that?

964
01:13:25,242 --> 01:13:32,444
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
"The rain in Spain..."stays mainly in the plain."

965
01:13:38,922 --> 01:13:40,048
再一次
Again.

966
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:47,559
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

967
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:50,861
我想她学会了…
I think she's got it I think she's got it

968
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:55,597
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

969
01:13:55,706 --> 01:13:58,834
天啊，她学会了…
By George, she's got it By George, she's got it

970
01:13:58,942 --> 01:14:02,139
现在，再一次，雨下在哪儿？
Now once again Where does it rain?

971
01:14:02,245 --> 01:14:05,442
在平原上…
On the plain, on the plain

972
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:08,541
那个潮湿的平原又在哪儿？
And where's that soggy plain?

973
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,815
在西班牙…
In Spain, in Spain

974
01:14:11,922 --> 01:14:16,359
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

975
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,087
好极了

976
01:14:18,195 --> 01:14:23,132
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain Stays mainly in the plain

977
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,966
在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡
In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

978
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:30,904
没有发生飓风
Hurricanes hardly happen

979
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:37,046
你让我来真是太好了
How kind of you to let me come

980
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:40,139
再说一次，雨落在哪儿？
Now once again Where does it rain?

981
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:43,378
在平原上…
On the plain, on the plain

982
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:46,456
那该死的平原又在哪儿？
And where's that blasted plain?

983
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:49,787
在西班牙…
In Spain, in Spain

984
01:14:49,893 --> 01:14:54,853
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上

985
01:14:56,066 --> 01:15:01,436
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上

986
01:15:02,339 --> 01:15:05,399
上校，来，来

987
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,020
平克林

988
01:15:46,883 --> 01:15:50,876
我们的进展很好，平克林 是出去试试她训练成果的时候
We're making fine progress, Pickering. Ithink the time has come to try her out

989
01:15:51,988 --> 01:15:53,649
你们还好吧，席根斯先生？
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins

990
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,315
我很好，你呢？
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?

991
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:56,790
很好，谢谢 很好
- Very well, thank you. - Good.

992
01:15:56,893 --> 01:15:59,623
让我们到公共场合 看看她的进展
Let's test her in public and see how she fares

993
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:03,597
席根斯先生 我被很大的声响给吵醒
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened by a dreadful pounding.

994
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:05,064
你知道是什么声音吗？
Do you know what it might have been?

995
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:07,398
我没听见，你有听见吗 平克林？
I didn't hear any pounding. Did you, Pickering?

996
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:08,334
没有啊

997
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,838
如果继续听到，皮尔斯太太 你最好去看医生
If this goes on, Mrs Pearce, you'd better see a doctor.

998
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,774
有了，我们带她去看赛马 赛马？
- I know. We'll take her to the races - The races

999
01:16:13,877 --> 01:16:15,606
我母亲在阿斯科特赛马场 有个包箱
My mother's box at Ascot

1000
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,839
你会先去问你母亲吧 当然会了
- You'll consult your mother firs - Yes, of course.

1001
01:16:21,484 --> 01:16:24,647
不，我们还是给她个惊喜 我们现在睡觉吧
No, I think we'd better surprise her. Now let's go to bed.

1002
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:27,655
明天一早，我们帮她买衣服
First thing in the morning, we'll go out and buy her a dress.

1003
01:16:27,757 --> 01:16:29,384
继续加油，伊莱沙
Now get on with your work, Eliza

1004
01:16:29,492 --> 01:16:31,483
但是席根斯先生 现在是凌晨了
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1005
01:16:31,595 --> 01:16:34,086
有比凌晨更好的工作时段吗？
What better time to work than early in the morning?

1006
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:36,865
哪里可以买到女人的外衣？
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1007
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,229
当然是怀特利街
Whitely's, of course.

1008
01:16:38,368 --> 01:16:39,426
你怎么会知道？
How do you know that?

1009
01:16:39,536 --> 01:16:40,798
这是常识啊
Common knowledge.

1010
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,934
我们不要买太花的衣服
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1011
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:47,476
我不喜欢外衣上有花花草草的
I despise those gowns with, sort of weeds here and weeds there.

1012
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:52,579
我们帮她买简单合适又高雅的 就是这样
We'll buy something sort of simple and modes...and elegant. That 's what 's called for.

1013
01:16:52,716 --> 01:16:54,980
或许这儿有个蝴蝶结
Perhaps with a bow.

1014
01:16:56,286 --> 01:16:57,753
是的，就这样没错
Yes That 's just right

1015
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,687
你们太努力工作了 压力造成脑子不清楚了
You've all been working much too hard. Ithink the strain is beginning to show.

1016
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:07,092
伊莱沙 不管席根斯先生怎么说
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says

1017
01:17:07,197 --> 01:17:09,461
你要把书放下，去睡觉吧
You must put down your books and go to bed.

1018
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:12,801
床！床！我无法上床去
Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed

1019
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:16,461
我的头太轻了，无法躺下
My head's too light to try to set it down

1020
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:22,710
睡觉！睡觉！我今晚无法成眠
Sleep! Sleep! I couldn't sleep tonight

1021
01:17:23,046 --> 01:17:27,142
就算有皇冠上 全部的珠宝也睡不着！
Not for all the jewels in the crown!

1022
01:17:29,052 --> 01:17:32,112
我可以整晚跳舞
I could have danced all night

1023
01:17:32,222 --> 01:17:35,385
我可以整晚跳舞
I could have danced all night

1024
01:17:35,492 --> 01:17:41,624
继续跳下去
And still have begged for more

1025
01:17:41,731 --> 01:17:44,859
我可以展翼高飞
I could have spread my wings

1026
01:17:44,968 --> 01:17:48,131
做各式各样
And done a thousand things

1027
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:54,473
我从没做过的事
I've never done before

1028
01:17:54,577 --> 01:18:01,073
我从不知何事令我如此兴奋
I'll never know what made it so exciting

1029
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:07,316
突然之间我心飞扬
Why all at once my heart took flight

1030
01:18:07,424 --> 01:18:16,222
我只知道，当他开始与我共舞
I only know when heBegan to dance with me

1031
01:18:16,299 --> 01:18:24,468
我能一直跳舞…整晚跳舞！
I could have danced, danced, dancedall night!

1032
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,245
已经过三点了
It's after three now.

1033
01:18:39,356 --> 01:18:41,483
你该同意了吧？
Don't you agree now?

1034
01:18:41,725 --> 01:18:44,660
她应该上床了！
She ought to be in bed!

1035
01:18:46,529 --> 01:18:49,692
我可以整晚跳舞
I could have danced all night

1036
01:18:49,799 --> 01:18:53,200
我可以整晚跳舞
I could have danced all night

1037
01:18:53,303 --> 01:18:59,469
继续跳下去
And still have begged for more

1038
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:02,739
我可以展翼高飞
I could have spread my wings

1039
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:06,111
做各式各样
And done a thousand things

1040
01:19:06,216 --> 01:19:12,519
我从没做过的事
I've never done before

1041
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:19,391
我从不知何事令我如此兴奋
I'll never know what made it so exciting

1042
01:19:19,496 --> 01:19:25,731
突然之间我心飞扬
Why all at once my heart took flight

1043
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:34,607
我只知道，当他开始与我跳舞
I only know when heBegan to dance with me

1044
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:43,312
我能一直跳舞…整晚跳舞！
I could have danced, danced, danced

1045
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,186
这的确是令人非常愉快 亲爱的

1046
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:51,226
但现在是睡觉的时候了

01:20:24,561 --> 01:20:30,966
我从不知何事令我如此兴奋
I'll never know what made it so exciting

1054
01:20:31,067 --> 01:20:37,131
突然之间我心飞扬
Why all at once my heart took flight

1055
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:45,670
我只知道，当他开始与我共舞

1058
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:44,363
所有该来的人都来了
Everyone who should be here is here

1059
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:52,275
阿斯科特赛马的开赛日 真是星光耀眼
What a smashing, positively dashing Spectacle, the Ascot opening day

1060
01:21:52,377 --> 01:22:00,216
与赛的马匹都准备好了 只等着开跑的哨音
At the gate are all the horses Waiting for the cue to fly away

1061
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:08,351
真是一个引人入胜的 阿斯科特赛马开赛日
What a gripping, absolutely ripping Moment at the Ascot opening day

1062
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,157
脉搏，急促
Pulses rushing

1063
01:22:12,264 --> 01:22:16,064
颜面，变红
Faces flushing

1064
01:22:16,168 --> 01:22:20,002
心跳，加快
Heartbeats speed up

1065
01:22:20,105 --> 01:22:23,165
我从未如此激动过！
I have never been so keyed up!

1066
01:22:24,176 --> 01:22:26,144
时间就快到了
Any second now

1067
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:28,008
要开始赛马了
They'll begin to run

1068
01:22:28,147 --> 01:22:32,550
听！哨音响起 马匹冲出来，看！
Hark! A bell is ringingThey are springing forward, look!

1069
01:22:32,951 --> 01:22:35,511
开始了
It has begun

1070
01:23:01,313 --> 01:23:09,948
真是令人屏息待静 速度如此之快
What a frenzied moment that wasDidn't they maintain an exhausting pace?

1071
01:23:10,055 --> 01:23:18,258
真是一个紧张刺激的 阿斯科特赛马开赛日
It was a thrilling, absolutely chillingRunning of the Ascot opening race!

1072
01:24:45,951 --> 01:24:47,111
母亲！
Mother!

1073
01:24:48,987 --> 01:24:51,046
亨利！真是令人意料之外
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

1074
01:24:51,156 --> 01:24:54,023
你好，母亲，你真漂亮
Hello, Mother.How nice you look.

1075
01:24:54,126 --> 01:24:57,459
你到这里干嘛？ 你保证不会来此的，快回家去
What are you doing here? You promised never to come to Ascot Go home.

1076
01:24:57,562 --> 01:24:59,086
不行，我来这里有事情要办
I can' t I'm here on business.

1077
01:24:59,197 --> 01:25:02,030
不可以，我说真的 你会得罪我所有的朋友
No, you mus I'm quite serious You ofend all my friends

1078
01:25:02,134 --> 01:25:04,568
他们一看到你 我就别想再看到他们了
The moment they meet you I never see them again.

1079
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:06,228
更何况看看你的服装
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot

1080
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:08,863
我可以换，母亲 我有件事情要你做
I changed my shirt Mother, I've got a job for you.

1081
01:25:08,974 --> 01:25:11,568
这是语言学的事情 我选了个女孩
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1082
01:25:11,677 --> 01:25:12,473
亨利
Oh, no, not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1083
01:25:12,577 --> 01:25:14,568
哦，不，不是谈恋爱 她是个卖花女

1084
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,116
我想要带她去大使舞会 但是我想先测试一下
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball but I wanted to try her out firs

1085
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:20,650
你说什么？ 你知道大使舞会的
- I beg your pardon? - Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1086
01:25:20,752 --> 01:25:21,946
我当然知道
So I invited her to your box today, do you understand?

1087
01:25:22,054 --> 01:25:24,579
所以我今天请她来你的包厢 懂了吗？

1088
01:25:24,823 --> 01:25:26,290
一个卖花女？
Common flower girl?

1089
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:28,392
没问题，我教过她如何说话
Itaught her how to speak properly.

1090
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:30,757
她的行为会非常得宜
She has strict instructions as to her behavior.

1091
01:25:30,862 --> 01:25:33,990
她只会谈两个主题 天气和大家的健康
She's to keep to two subjects: The weather and everybody's health.

1092
01:25:34,366 --> 01:25:37,494
“天气真好”和“你好” 不要让她讲到太广泛的事情
"Fine day!" and "How do you do?" Not just let herself go on things in general.

1093
01:25:37,602 --> 01:25:39,627
帮她的忙，你们会很安全的
Help her along, darling. You'll be quite safe.

1094
01:25:39,738 --> 01:25:41,933
安全？ 在赛马期间谈论我们的健康？
Safe? To talk about one's health in the middle of a race?

1095
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,065
她总得谈些什么吧
Well, she's got to talk about something.

1096
01:25:44,176 --> 01:25:45,370
她现在在哪里？
Where is the girl now?

1097
01:25:45,477 --> 01:25:48,503
她在整理服饰 她的衣服不太合身
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes we bought her didn't quite fit.

1098
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:51,138
我告诉平克林我们应该陪着她
Itold Pickering we should have taken her with us

1099
01:25:54,486 --> 01:25:57,649
恩斯福特希尔夫人 午安，席根斯夫人
- Mrs Eynsford-Hill. - Good afternoon, Mrs Higgins

1100
01:25:59,091 --> 01:26:00,683

1101
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:02,225
你好？

1102
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:04,622
我好像见过你 我不知道
- I've seen you somewhere before. - I don't know.

1103
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:07,028
没关系，你最好坐下吧
It doesn 't matter. You better sit down.

1104
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:12,430
他们到哪里去了？
Where the devil can they be?

1105
01:26:48,006 --> 01:26:49,837
平克林上校 你正好赶上喝茶的时间
Colonel Pickering, you're just in time for tea

1106
01:26:49,941 --> 01:26:53,206

Thank you, Mrs Higgins May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1107
01:26:53,311 --> 01:26:54,642
亲爱的，杜立特尔小姐
My dear, Miss Doolittle.

1108
01:26:54,746 --> 01:26:57,442
你请我来真是太好了
How kind of you to let me come.

1109
01:26:57,549 --> 01:26:58,880
我很高兴你能来

1110
01:27:00,318 --> 01:27:02,650
巴克辛顿夫人 你好？

1111
01:27:02,754 --> 01:27:04,085
你好

1112
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:05,918
巴克辛顿阁下 你好？
- Lord Boxington. - How do you do?

1113
01:27:06,024 --> 01:27:06,956
你好？
How do you do?

1114
01:27:07,059 --> 01:27:09,960
恩斯福特夫人，杜立特尔小姐 你好？
- Mrs Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle. - How do you do?

1115
01:27:10,062 --> 01:27:11,689
你好？
How do you do?

1116
01:27:11,797 --> 01:27:13,662
还有佛雷狄恩斯福特希尔
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1117
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,391
你好？
How do you do?

1118
01:27:18,737 --> 01:27:20,295
你好？
How do you do?

1119
01:27:21,073 --> 01:27:22,165
杜立特尔小姐
Miss Doolittle.

1120
01:27:22,607 --> 01:27:25,770
午安，席根斯教授
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins

1121
01:27:34,986 --> 01:27:40,014
第一场赛马很刺激 杜立特尔小姐，可惜你错过了
The first race was very exciting, Miss Doolittle.I'm so sorry that you missed it

1122
01:27:40,258 --> 01:27:41,987
你认为会下雨吗？
Will it rain, do you think?

1123
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,592
西班牙的雨大多数落在平原上
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.

1124
01:27:51,603 --> 01:27:57,098
但是在哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡，没有发生飓风
But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1125
01:27:57,476 --> 01:27:58,909
这真的很好笑
How awfully funny.

1126
01:27:59,111 --> 01:28:02,547
有何不对，年轻人？ 我想我说对了
What is wrong with that, young man? I bet I got it right

1127
01:28:02,848 --> 01:28:03,780
真妙
Smashing.

1128
01:28:04,216 --> 01:28:06,684
难道天气不会突然变冷吗？
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1129
01:28:07,185 --> 01:28:10,712
我希望不会染上非季节性感冒
I do hope we won't have any unseasonable cold spells

1130
01:28:10,822 --> 01:28:12,790
否则会引起流行性感冒
They bring on so much influenza

1131
01:28:12,891 --> 01:28:15,621
我的家人会很容易染上
And the whole of our family is susceptible to it

1132
01:28:15,727 --> 01:28:20,528
他们是说我姑姑死于感冒
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1133
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:24,534
但我相信是他们解决了她
But it's my belief they done the old woman in.

1134
01:28:25,637 --> 01:28:27,002
解决了她？
Done her in?

1135
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:29,234
是的，上帝爱你
Yes, Lord love you.

1136
01:28:29,508 --> 01:28:31,908
她为什么会死于感冒…
Why should she die of influenza...

1137
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:35,502
一年前她得了白喉但痊愈了
when she come through diphtheria right enough the year before.

1138
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:38,413
她为此非常担忧
Fairly blue with it she was.

1139
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,781
他们都以为她死了
They all thought she was dead.

1140
01:28:40,886 --> 01:28:45,323
但我父亲用汤匙装琴酒给她喝
But my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat.

1141
01:28:49,995 --> 01:28:54,694
直到她咬断汤匙的把手
Then she come to so sudden she bit the bowl of the spoon.

1142
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:57,134
天啊！
Dear me!

1143
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:03,570
为何如此强壮的女人 会死于感冒？
Now what call would a woman with that strength in her...have to die of influenza

1144
01:29:04,543 --> 01:29:09,105
她该给我的新草帽下场呢？
And what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?

1145
01:29:11,383 --> 01:29:14,147
有人偷走了
Somebody pinched it

1146
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:20,620
我要说的是 他们偷走了，解决了她
And what I say is Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1147
01:29:21,193 --> 01:29:24,356
解决了她？你是这样说的吗？
Done her in? Done her in, did you say?

1148
01:29:24,529 --> 01:29:26,156
这是什么意思？
Whatever does it mean?

1149
01:29:26,264 --> 01:29:31,395
哦，这是新术语 解决某人的意思是杀了他们
Oh, that 's the new small talk. "To do somebody in" means to kill them.

1150
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:35,028
但你不会相信 你姑姑是被杀的吧？
But you surely don't believe your aunt was killed?

1151
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,664
我不会吗？
Do I not

1152
01:29:36,775 --> 01:29:42,008
他们为了一根针都会杀她 更别说一顶帽子
Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1153
01:29:42,113 --> 01:29:47,574
但你父亲不该拿酒喂她喝
But it can' t have been right for your father...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1154
01:29:47,686 --> 01:29:49,347
这可能会杀了她
It might have killed her.

1155
01:29:49,454 --> 01:29:53,686
她不会，琴酒对她来说是母乳
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1156
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:59,458
而且他自己喝了更多
Besides, he poured so much down his own throat he knew the good of it

1157
01:29:59,564 --> 01:30:01,225
你是说他喝酒？
Do you mean that he drank?

1158
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,928
喝酒？这积习难改
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1159
01:30:08,006 --> 01:30:11,464
你笑些什么？
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1160
01:30:11,576 --> 01:30:15,205
那新术语，你说得真好
The new small talk. You do it so awfully well.

1161
01:30:15,313 --> 01:30:19,647
如果我说的很恰当 那你笑个什么劲？
Well, if I was doing it proper, what was you sniggering at?

1162
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:22,345
我是否说了我不该说的吗？
Have I said anything I oughtn 't

1163
01:30:23,922 --> 01:30:25,617
完全没有
Not at all, my dear.

1164
01:30:25,757 --> 01:30:27,850
那就好
Well, that 's a mercy anyhow.

1165
01:30:29,828 --> 01:30:35,323
我不知道是否可以赶上 下一场下注但是走吧，亲爱的
I don't know if there's enough time before the next race to place a bet...
but come, my dear.

1166
01:30:36,568 --> 01:30:40,026
我下注七号 我很高兴能送给你
I have a bet on number seven. Ishould be so happy if you would take it

1167
01:30:40,138 --> 01:30:42,231
你会更喜欢这场赛马的
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1168
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,932
你人真好
That 's very kind of you.

1169
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:45,168
它的名字叫多佛
His name is Dover.

1170
01:30:45,277 --> 01:30:46,642
走吧，伊莱莎
Come along, Eliza

1171
01:30:50,181 --> 01:30:53,912
它们又来了，准备要起跑
There they are again
Lining up to run

1172
01:30:54,286 --> 01:30:58,450
它们屏息以待，准备好了，看
Now they're holding steady
They are ready for it, look

1173
01:30:59,424 --> 01:31:01,790
开始了
It has begun

1174
01:31:07,565 --> 01:31:09,362
加油…多佛
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1175
01:31:10,335 --> 01:31:13,236
加油…多佛
Come on.
Come on, Dover!

1176
01:31:13,371 --> 01:31:14,338
加油！
Come on!

1177
01:31:18,777 --> 01:31:23,305
快点，多佛！加速你的玻璃！
Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' ass

1178
01:31:29,421 --> 01:31:30,820
哦，亲爱的
Oh, my dear.

1179
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:49,638
你不是认真的吧，亨利 真的要带她去参加大使舞会
You're not serious, Henry. You don't expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1180
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:51,265
你认为她还没准备好？
Don't you think she's ready for it

1181
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:53,742
亲爱的亨利 她比较适合喧闹的场所
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1182
01:31:53,845 --> 01:31:56,075
她的语言或许需要再加强 但是…
Her language may need a little refining, but- -

1183
01:31:56,181 --> 01:31:59,776
真的，亨利 你应该了解这是不可能的任务
Really, Henry, if you cannot see how impossible this whole project is...

1184
01:31:59,884 --> 01:32:01,749
你不该为她做愚蠢的事情
then you must be absolutely potty about her.

1185
01:32:01,853 --> 01:32:05,152
我建议你放弃不要折磨你自己 或这可怜的女孩
Ladvise you to give it up and not put yourself...or this poor girl through any more.

1186
01:32:05,256 --> 01:32:07,986
放弃 这是我最具挑战性的工作
Why, it's the most fascinating venture I've ever undertaken.

1187
01:32:08,093 --> 01:32:11,324
平克林和我日夜不眠地投入 这充实了我们的生命
Pickering and I are at it from morning till night It fills our whole lives

1188
01:32:11,429 --> 01:32:15,229
教导伊莱莎，与伊莱莎对话 听伊莱莎说话，帮伊莱莎穿衣
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza, listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza

1189
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:16,595
什么？

1190
01:32:16,701 --> 01:32:20,193
你像是个小孩在玩洋娃娃游戏
You're a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.

1191
01:32:20,305 --> 01:32:21,499
车子来了
Here's the car.

1192
01:33:30,575 --> 01:33:31,940
谢谢

1193
01:33:42,821 --> 01:33:43,845
晚安，先生
Good evening, sir.

1194
01:33:43,955 --> 01:33:46,515
晚餐好了没？我饿坏了 立刻就好，先生
- Is dinner ready? I'm famished. - Immediately, sir.

1195
01:33:46,724 --> 01:33:48,521
晚安，席根斯教授
Good evening, Professor Higgins

1196
01:34:06,611 --> 01:34:11,207
当她提到她姑姑如何喝东西时
When she mentioned How her aunt bit off the spoon

1197
01:34:11,316 --> 01:34:15,275
她完全把我迷倒了
She completely done me in
And my heart went on A journey to the moon

1198
01:34:15,386 --> 01:34:19,186
我的心飞到遥远的月球上了
When she told about her father And the gin

1199
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:24,489
当她提到她父亲和琴酒时

1200
01:34:24,596 --> 01:34:29,295
我从未见过如此好笑的行为
And I never saw A more enchanting farce

1201
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:34,337
当她大声叫“加速你的…”
Than the moment when she shouted "Move your bloomin"...

1202
01:34:34,806 --> 01:34:36,831
什么事？ 杜立特尔小姐在吗？
- Yes, sir? - Is Miss Doolittle in?

1203
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:38,431
是谁来拜访？
Whom shall I say is calling?

1204
01:34:38,843 --> 01:34:41,869
佛雷狄恩斯福特希尔 如果她不记得我
Freddy Eynsford-Hill. If she doesn 't remember who I am...

1205
01:34:42,247 --> 01:34:44,909
就告诉她 我是看着她笑的年轻人
tell her I'm the chap who was sniggering at her.

1206
01:34:45,283 --> 01:34:46,250
是的
Yes, sir.

1207
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:48,615
可否将这个给她？ 好
And will you give her these?

1208
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,917
要进来吗？ 他们正在用餐，你在大厅等
Wouldn't you like to come in, sir?
They're having dinner, but you may wait in the hall.

1209
01:34:52,023 --> 01:34:55,356
不用了，谢谢 我在外面沉醉一下
No, thank you. I want to drink in the street where she lives

1210
01:35:04,269 --> 01:35:09,866
我以前常在这条路上漫步
I have often walked Down this street before

1211
01:35:09,974 --> 01:35:15,537
但是脚下的步伐毫无特别
But the pavement always stayed Beneath my feet before

1212
01:35:15,647 --> 01:35:21,142
瞬时间我的思绪飞扬在空中
All at once am I Several stories high

1213
01:35:21,252 --> 01:35:27,054
知道这是你所住的街道
Knowing I'm on the street Where you live

1214
01:35:27,158 --> 01:35:32,790
丁香花不是在市中心吗？
Are there lilac trees In the heart of town?

1215
01:35:32,897 --> 01:35:38,494
听到云雀在城市中鸣叫？
Can you hear a lark In any other part of town?

1216
01:35:38,603 --> 01:35:44,200
是否会迷倒所有的住户？
Does enchantment pour Out of every door?

1217
01:35:44,309 --> 01:35:50,544
不，只是因你住在此
No, it's just on the street Where you live

1218
01:35:50,648 --> 01:36:02,185
知道你在附近 那感觉多么强烈
And, oh, the towering feeling
Just to know Somehow you are near

1219
01:36:02,293 --> 01:36:07,162
无法抗拒的情感
The overpowering feeling

1220
01:36:07,265 --> 01:36:13,397
因为你随时都会出现
That any second You may suddenly appear

1221
01:36:13,504 --> 01:36:19,238
我不在乎别人的注视
People stop and stare They don't bother me

1222
01:36:19,344 --> 01:36:25,044
我只希望能够在此等你
For there's nowhere else on Earth That I would rather be

1223
01:36:25,149 --> 01:36:32,954
让时光飞逝，我不在乎
Let the time go by I won't care if I

1224
01:36:33,057 --> 01:36:40,054
我只要在你住的街道上等你
Can be here on the street Where you live

1225
01:36:40,932 --> 01:36:42,399
先生

1226
01:36:45,003 --> 01:36:46,937
非常抱歉，先生
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1227
01:36:47,071 --> 01:36:50,165
杜立特尔小姐说 她不再见到任何人了
Miss Doolittle says she doesn 't want to see anyone ever again.

1228
01:36:50,274 --> 01:36:51,935
为何？她是如此惊艳动人
But why? She was unbelievable.

1229
01:36:52,043 --> 01:36:55,206
我知道了，先生 还有什么话要转告？
So I've been told, sir. Is there any further message?

1230
01:36:55,513 --> 01:36:57,640
有，告诉她我会等的
Tell her that I'll wait

1231
01:36:57,749 --> 01:37:00,149
哦，那有可能要好几天 甚至一个星期
Oh, but it might be days, sir, even weeks

1232
01:37:00,251 --> 01:37:02,685
你看不出来吗？ 我在这里很快乐
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1233
01:37:11,863 --> 01:37:17,563
我不在乎别人的注视
People stop and stare They don't bother me

1234
01:37:17,669 --> 01:37:23,539
我只希望能在此等你
For there's nowhere else on Earth That I would rather be

1235
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:32,276
让时光飞逝，我不在乎
Let the time go by I won't care if I

1236
01:37:32,383 --> 01:37:43,123
我只要在你住的街道上等你
Can be here on the street Where you live

1237
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:50,292
席根斯，是真的 如此下去是很不人道的行为
It really is, Higgins It's inhuman to continue.

1238
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:53,461
你知道这六周内 你要她做到什么吗？
Do you realize what you've got to try and teach this poor girl in six weeks

1239
01:37:53,571 --> 01:37:57,166
你要教她走路，说话，穿着 各种阶级的应对礼貌
You've got to teach her to walk, talk, address a duke, a lord...a bishop, an ambassador. 

1240
01:37:57,275 --> 01:37:59,072
根本就是不可能的事
It's absolutely impossible.

1241
01:37:59,177 --> 01:38:02,442
席根斯 我想要取消这次的打赌
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you that I want to call of the bet

1242
01:38:02,547 --> 01:38:04,777
我和你一样是很顽固的人
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.

1243
01:38:04,882 --> 01:38:06,782
实验结束了
This experiment is over.

1244
01:38:06,884 --> 01:38:12,880
连国王的命令也无法改变我意 失陪！
And nothing short of an order from the King could force me to recant.

1245
01:38:13,224 --> 01:38:15,488
明白吗？ 席根斯，实验已结束了
You understand, Higgins It's over.

1246
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:20,121
席根斯，如果今晚 在大使馆发生任何差错
Higgins, if there's any mishap at the Embassy tonight...

1247
01:38:20,231 --> 01:38:22,825
如果杜立特尔小姐 遭受任何侮辱
if Miss Doolittle sufers any embarrassment whatever...

1248
01:38:22,934 --> 01:38:24,162
都将是你个人的责任
it'll be on your head alone.

1249
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:25,496
伊莱莎能办到的
Eliza can do anything.

1250
01:38:25,603 --> 01:38:27,161
假如她被发现了呢？ 记得赛马场上的事情吗？
Suppose she's discovered? Remember Ascot

1251
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:29,136
如果她忘了舞步 或是碰出几句粗话
Suppose she makes another ghastly mistake?

1252
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:32,038
舞会里没有马的，平克林
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1253
01:38:34,178 --> 01:38:36,442
想到了就头大
Think of how agonizing it would be.

1254
01:38:36,547 --> 01:38:39,175
万一今晚发生差错 不知道该如何是好
If anything happened tonight, I don't know what I'd do.

1255
01:38:39,283 --> 01:38:40,841
你还是可以回部队去
You could always rejoin your regiment

1256
01:38:40,952 --> 01:38:42,783
没时间开玩笑了，席根斯
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins

1257
01:38:42,887 --> 01:38:47,085
在过去六周里 已超过那女孩所能承受的礼仪
The way you've driven her the last six weeks...has exceeded all bounds of common decency.

1258
01:38:47,191 --> 01:38:50,160
拜托，别在那里踱步 可否坐下来？
For God's sake, stop pacing up and down. Can' t you settle somewhere?

1259
01:38:50,261 --> 01:38:52,195
喝点酒，可以让你不会紧张
Have some port lt'll quieten your nerves

1260
01:38:52,296 --> 01:38:53,786
我并不紧张
I'm not nervous

1261
01:38:55,266 --> 01:38:57,200
酒在哪里？ 在钢琴上面
- Where is it - On the piano.

1262
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:00,159
车子已经来了
The car 's here, sir.

1263
01:39:00,271 --> 01:39:02,068
好，告诉杜立特尔小姐 好吗？
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle, will you?

1264
01:39:02,173 --> 01:39:05,506
真的要告诉杜立特尔小姐 我打赌她那件礼服根本不合身
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed. I'll bet you that damned gown doesn 't fit.

1265
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:07,874
我警告过你不该找法国设计师
I warned you about these French designers

1266
01:39:07,979 --> 01:39:10,914
该找英国的 法国不跟我们同国
We should have gone to an English shop. They would've been on our side.

1267
01:39:11,015 --> 01:39:13,108
喝一杯吗？ 不用，谢谢
- Have a glass of port - No, thank you.

1268
01:39:19,891 --> 01:39:24,191
你有确信她能够记住 你所教的一切吗？
Are you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?

1269
01:39:24,662 --> 01:39:26,425
我们只有等着看了
Well, we shall see.

1270
01:39:26,697 --> 01:39:28,096
如果她失败了呢？
Suppose she doesn 't

1271
01:39:29,467 --> 01:39:31,059
这场打赌我就输了
I lose my bet

1272
01:39:31,169 --> 01:39:34,832
真受不了你那从容自负的态度
There's one thing I can' t stand about you, that 's your confounded complacency.

1273
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:36,770
尤其是在这紧要关头 又关系这么多的金额
At a moment like this, with so much at stake...

1274
01:39:36,874 --> 01:39:39,866
你竟然还不需要喝一杯
it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of port

1275
01:39:42,246 --> 01:39:45,773
关于那女孩呢？ 你好像完全不在乎她
And what about the girl? You act as though she doesn 't matter at all.

1276
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:48,677
胡说，平克林，她当然很重要
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters

1277
01:39:49,086 --> 01:39:51,486
你以为我花心血是为了什么？
What do you think I've been doing all these months

1278
01:39:51,589 --> 01:39:54,752
有什么能比这更令人欣慰
What could possibly matter more than to take a human being...

1279
01:39:55,159 --> 01:39:59,061
彻底改变一个人 让她能有新的谈吐方式
and change her into a diferent human being by creating a new speech for her?

1280
01:39:59,463 --> 01:40:05,129
这完全消弭了阶级之间 灵魂之间的障碍
It's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class...and soul from soul.

1281
01:40:05,803 --> 01:40:09,068
哦，她对我而言很重要的
Oh, she matters immensely.

1282
01:40:30,161 --> 01:40:32,652
杜立特尔小姐，你真漂亮
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1283
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:34,889
谢谢，平克林上校
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1284
01:40:34,999 --> 01:40:36,557
你不觉得吗，席根斯？
Don't you think so, Higgins

1285
01:40:39,637 --> 01:40:42,470
非常好，真的非常好
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1286
01:41:39,063 --> 01:41:52,238
“中场休息”

1287
01:41:57,381 --> 01:42:07,689
“间奏曲”

1288
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:45,430
大师！…
Maestro! Maestro!

1289
01:43:47,338 --> 01:43:48,305
你不记得我了？
Don't you remember me?

1290
01:43:48,406 --> 01:43:49,998
不记得，你是谁？
No. Who the devil are you?

1291
01:43:50,108 --> 01:43:53,669
我是你最棒的第一位门生
I'm your pupil. Your firs your greates your best pupil.

1292
01:43:53,778 --> 01:43:56,508
我是神童索腾卡帕锡
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1293
01:43:57,649 --> 01:43:59,640
我让你名闻于全欧洲
Imade your name famous throughout Europe.

1294
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:01,582
你教我语言学 你不可能忘记我的
You teach me phonetics You cannot forget me.

1295
01:44:01,686 --> 01:44:03,153
你为何不理个发？
Why don't you have your hair cut

1296
01:44:03,254 --> 01:44:06,348
我并没有像你一般的风采
I don't have your imposing appearance, your figure, your brow.

1297
01:44:06,457 --> 01:44:09,324
如果我把头发剪短了 就没有人会注意到我
If I had my hair cut, nobody would notice me.

1298
01:44:09,427 --> 01:44:11,088
这些是你从哪儿弄来的？
Where did you get all of these old coins

1299
01:44:11,195 --> 01:44:13,186
是我对语言贡献得来的勋章
These are decorations for languages

1300
01:44:13,298 --> 01:44:15,198
今晚特兰夕法尼亚女王要来此
The Queen of Transylvania is here this evening.

1301
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:17,962
我是她在官方场合 不可或缺的要角
I'm indispensable to her at these oficial international parties

1302
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:21,266
我精通32种语言 我认识欧洲的每一个人
I speak 32 languages I know everyone in Europe.

1303
01:44:21,372 --> 01:44:23,636
没有骗子可以逃过我的法眼
No imposter can escape my detection.

1304

希腊，我的天啊！

1307
01:44:31,316 --> 01:44:33,876
他假装不会说英语 但是骗不了我的
He pretends not to know any English, but he cannot deceive me.

1308
01:44:33,985 --> 01:44:36,180
他是约克夏钟表制造商的儿子
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1309
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:42,855
他的英语说得棒极了 无法掩饰他真实的身分
He speaks English so villainously that he cannot utter a word...without betraying his origin.

1310
01:44:42,961 --> 01:44:46,453
我帮他假装 但他们都得付出代价
I help him pretend, but I make him pay through the nose. I make them all pay.

1311
01:44:46,564 --> 01:44:49,692
打扰了，女王陛下要你上楼去
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs Her Excellency asked for you.

Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins Excuse me.

1329

席根斯教授
Professor Higgins

1330
01:46:22,527 --> 01:46:26,725
一付不可捉摸的样子 好像她住在花园中
Such a faraway look, as if she's always lived in a garden.

1331
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:29,092
她是和花园有点关系
So she has. A sort of garden.

1332
01:46:57,995 --> 01:47:01,431
亨利必须马上送伊莱莎回家 这里有位语言专家
Henry must take Eliza home at once. There's a language expert here.

1333
01:47:01,532 --> 01:47:04,695
专门揭穿冒牌者的身分 你说什么？
- Sort of you know, imposterologis - I beg you pardon?

1334
01:47:05,470 --> 01:47:07,495
那位和平克林上校一起的女孩
The young lady with Colonel Pickering...

1335
01:47:08,139 --> 01:47:09,697
查出她是谁

1336
01:47:09,941 --> 01:47:11,101
我的荣幸
With pleasure.

1337
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:13,837
目前的场面一触即发
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1338
01:47:19,984 --> 01:47:22,544
索腾，再告诉我一些 有关希腊大使的事
Tell me, Zoltan, some more about the Greek ambassador.

1339
01:47:22,653 --> 01:47:26,180
很乐意，但请先介绍我 和那位优雅的女孩认识
Gladly, but first I would love you to present me to this glorious creature.

1340
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:28,121
他真的是从约克夏出身的吗？
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1341
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,360
特兰夕法尼亚女王陛下…
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

1342
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:43,634
和太子殿下葛戈
and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1343
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:32,245
迷人，真迷人
Charming. Quite charming.

1344
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:35,354
这位是杜立特尔小姐，女王
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1345
01:50:11,455 --> 01:50:14,117
杜立特尔小姐 我的皇子想和你跳舞
Miss Doolittle, my son would like to dance with you.

1346
01:51:09,647 --> 01:51:12,172
伊莱沙

1347
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,831
真的是大功告成
Absolutely fantastic.

1348
01:53:26,306 --> 01:53:27,739
一群傻瓜蛋
A lot of tomfoolery.

1349
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,831
没想到如此地成功
It was an immense achievement

1350
01:53:29,943 --> 01:53:31,205
怎样呢，席根斯先生？
Well, Mr. Higgins

1351

1352
01:53:35,281 --> 01:53:38,876
席根斯，你真是棒极了
Higgins, you were superb, absolutely superb.

1353
01:53:38,985 --> 01:53:42,944
说实话 难道你真的都不紧张？
Tell us the truth now, weren't you a little bit nervous once or twice?

1354
01:53:43,056 --> 01:53:44,785
整晚完全不紧张吗？
Not during the whole evening?

1355
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:46,552
直到我知道我赢了之后
Not when I saw we were going to win.

1356
01:53:46,659 --> 01:53:48,422
我感觉像熊在笼子晃来晃去 无所事事
Lfelt like a bear in a cage hanging about

1357
01:53:48,528 --> 01:53:50,393
没想到如此成功
It was an immense achievement

1358
01:53:50,496 --> 01:53:53,124
如果我没自信 我两个月前就放弃了
If I hadn't backed myself to do it, I'd have given it up two months ago.

1359
01:53:53,232 --> 01:53:54,961
真的是大功告成
Absolutely fantastic.

1360
01:53:55,068 --> 01:53:56,592
真的，一群傻瓜蛋
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1361
01:53:56,703 --> 01:53:58,637
席根斯，我向你致敬
Higgins, I salute you.

1362
01:53:58,738 --> 01:54:01,468
那些傻瓜根本不知道 他们做了什么傻事
The silly people don't know their own silly business.

1363
01:54:01,574 --> 01:54:04,634
今晚，老兄，你办到了…
Tonight, old man, you did it You did it, you did it

1364
01:54:04,744 --> 01:54:07,611
你说你办得到，你真的办到了
You said that you would do it And indeed you did

1365
01:54:07,714 --> 01:54:10,683
我以为你会懊恼 我怀疑你办得到
I thought that you would rue it I doubted you'd do it

1366
01:54:10,783 --> 01:54:13,752
但是现在我必须承认你成功了
But now I must admit it That succeed you did

1367
01:54:13,953 --> 01:54:16,581
你应得到勋章或加封进爵
You should get a medal Or be even made a knight

1368
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:19,419
哦，没什么大不了
Oh, it was nothing, really nothing

1369
01:54:20,059 --> 01:54:22,960
你独自一人克服 迎面而来的障碍
All alone you hurdled Every obstacle in sight

1370
01:54:23,062 --> 01:54:26,225
慢着…我不能独享这份荣耀
Now wait, now wait Give credit where it's due

1371
01:54:26,332 --> 01:54:28,857
你也有很大的功劳
A lot of the glory goes to you

1372
01:54:29,569 --> 01:54:32,561
但是你才是办到的人 你办到了…
But you're the one who did it Who did it, who did it

1373
01:54:32,672 --> 01:54:36,972
是你坚毅不服输的精神
As sturdy as Gibraltar Not a second did you falter
There's no doubt about it

1374
01:54:37,076 --> 01:54:40,512
你办到了！
You did it!

1375
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:47,849
我得承认今晚我很紧张 以为自己会惊吓而死
I must have aged a year tonight At times I thought I'd die of fright

1376
01:54:47,954 --> 01:54:50,650
没有放松过一分钟
Never was there a momentary lull

1377
01:54:51,824 --> 01:54:55,851
当我们一进去 我立刻知道成功在握
Shortly after we came in I saw at once we'd easily win

1378
01:54:55,962 --> 01:54:58,692
在那之后，我更确定赢了
And after that I found it deadly dull

1379
01:54:59,999 --> 01:55:02,194
你们真该在场听那些惊叹声
You should have heard The "oohs"and "aahs"

1380
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:04,292
每个人都在猜她是谁
Everyone wondering who she was

1381
01:55:04,404 --> 01:55:07,771
他们好像从没见过女人
You'd think they'd never seen A lady before

1382
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:13,139
当王子要求见她时
And when the Prince of Transylvania Asked to meet her

1383
01:55:13,246 --> 01:55:17,273
伸出手腕带她进舞池
And gave his arm To lead her to the floor

1384
01:55:18,117 --> 01:55:21,382
我就告诉他，你办到了…
I said to him: "You did it You did it, you did it"

1385
01:55:21,487 --> 01:55:24,615
他们认为她气质非凡 举止高贵
They thought she was ecstatic And so damned aristocratic

1386
01:55:24,724 --> 01:55:30,424
没人想到这完全是你的杰作
And they never knew That youdid it

1387
01:55:32,632 --> 01:55:34,497
真是感谢索腾卡帕锡
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1388
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,795
如果不是有他 我还真的很无聊呢
If it hadn't been for him I would've died of boredom.

1389
01:55:36,903 --> 01:55:39,167
卡帕锡？那可怕的匈牙利人 他在那里？
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungaria Was he there?

1390
01:55:39,272 --> 01:55:42,139
对，他在那里耍他的老把戏
Yes, he was there all right and up to his old tricks

1391
01:55:42,542 --> 01:55:47,377
那无赖利用语言科学 专门来敲诈行骗别人
That blackguard Who uses the science of speech
More to blackmail and swindle than teach

1392
01:55:48,214 --> 01:55:54,016
他想用他的专业 来查出杜立特尔小姐是谁
He made it the devilish business of his
To find out who this Miss Doolittle is

1393
01:55:55,021 --> 01:55:59,788
只要我们一转身 他像猎犬般地在身边
Every time we looked around There he was
That hairy hound from Budapest

1394
01:56:01,761 --> 01:56:06,164
根本就不放过我们，真烦人
Never leaving us alone Never have I ever known
A ruder pest

1395
01:56:08,101 --> 01:56:12,504
后来认为不让他有机会接近她 这岂不是太傻了
Finally I decided it was foolish Not to let him have his chance with her

1396
01:56:14,407 --> 01:56:18,400
所以我就退一边 让他和她来共舞
So I stepped aside And let him dance with her

1397
01:56:20,179 --> 01:56:25,549
他就尽力使出全身的魅力
Oozing charm from every pore He oiled his way around the floor

1398
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:29,985
用尽方法 只想拆穿她的真面目
Every trick that he could play He used to strip her mask away

1399
01:56:30,423 --> 01:56:34,519
音乐结束 他很得意以为自己赢了
And when at last the dance was done He glowed as if he knew he'd won

1400
01:56:35,328 --> 01:56:38,456
满脸微笑迫不及待想开口
And with a voice too eager And a smile too broad

1401
01:56:38,931 --> 01:56:42,628
她告诉宴会女主人 她是个冒牌货
He announced to the hostess That she was a fraud

1402
01:56:43,369 --> 01:56:44,666
不！
No!

1403
01:56:50,109 --> 01:56:54,341
她的英语太标准 那就表示她是外国人
"Her English is too good,"he said "That clearly indicates that she is foreign

1404
01:56:56,616 --> 01:57:01,280
有人曾说英国本地人 不可能讲那种标准的英语
"Whereas others are instructed In their native language
"English people aren't

1405
01:57:02,955 --> 01:57:07,619
虽然她可以向语言专家学英语
"And although she may have studied with An expert dialectician and grammarian

1406
01:57:09,795 --> 01:57:14,789
但我还是可以探出 她的真实身分
"I can tell that she was born

1407
01:57:15,468 --> 01:57:16,867
她是匈牙利人
"Hungarian"

1408
01:57:18,738 --> 01:57:21,434
不只是匈牙利人还有贵族血统
Not only Hungarian but of royal blood

1409
01:57:22,308 --> 01:57:24,299
她是一位公主
She is a princess

1410
01:57:24,677 --> 01:57:28,477
他说她的血统比多瑙河还清
"Her blood,"he said "Is bluer than the Danube is or ever was

1411
01:57:28,614 --> 01:57:31,549
脸上充满了贵族气质
"Royalty is absolutely written on her face

1412
01:57:31,651 --> 01:57:34,745
她以为骗得了我但其实不然
"She thought I was taken in But actually I never was

1413
01:57:34,854 --> 01:57:37,687
她怎认为可以骗得了自己同胞
"How could she deceive Another member of her race?

1414
01:57:38,391 --> 01:57:42,885
他说我知道全世界各国语言
"I know each language on the map" Said he

1415
01:57:42,995 --> 01:57:47,295
她是不折不扣的匈牙利公主
"And she's Hungarian As the first Hungarian Rhapsody"

1416
01:57:48,701 --> 01:57:54,765
太精彩了

1417
01:57:55,308 --> 01:57:59,142
恭喜，席根斯教授
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1418
01:57:59,545 --> 01:58:03,003
祝贺你光荣的胜利
For your glorious victory

1419
01:58:03,282 --> 01:58:07,048
恭喜，席根斯教授
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1420
01:58:07,453 --> 01:58:10,911
你将会名留青史
You'll be mentioned in history

1421
01:58:11,924 --> 01:58:31,334
恭喜，席根斯教授 祝贺你光荣的胜利

1422
01:58:33,613 --> 01:58:35,808
感谢上帝，一切都结束了
Well, thank God, that 's over.

1423
01:58:36,349 --> 01:58:38,817
我终于可以安眠了
Now I can go to bed without dreading tomorrow.

1424
01:58:41,487 --> 01:58:43,785
晚安，席根斯先生 晚安，皮尔斯太太
- Good night, Mr. Higgins - Good night, Mrs Pearce.

1425
01:58:43,889 --> 01:58:47,757
我也想睡了，晚安，席根斯 真是难忘的一夜
Ithink I'll turn in, too. Good night, Higgins It's been a great occasion.

1426
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,293
晚安，平克林
Good night, Pickering.

1427
01:58:50,396 --> 01:58:51,863
皮尔斯太太？
Mrs Pearce?

1428
01:58:52,665 --> 01:58:56,863
该死 我要她明早送咖啡不要茶
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me cofee in the morning instead of tea

1429
01:58:57,503 --> 01:59:00,904
伊莱沙，你留条子给她好吗？ 把灯关掉
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza And put out the lights.

1430
01:59:49,088 --> 01:59:51,682
是不是在楼下，哦，真是的
Must be downstairs Oh, darn it

1431
01:59:52,058 --> 01:59:53,855
我这些天都没在用脑子
I'll leave my head behind one of these days

1432
01:59:53,959 --> 01:59:56,154
我到底把拖鞋放哪去了？
What the devil have I done with my slippers

1433
01:59:59,332 --> 02:00:00,924
这是你的拖鞋！
Here are your slippers

1434
02:00:02,101 --> 02:00:06,197
拿去

1435
02:00:06,305 --> 02:00:10,207
拿去你的拖鞋 希望你穿上后失去好运
Take your slippers and may you never have a day 's luck with them.

1436
02:00:10,843 --> 02:00:14,574
怎么回事？哪里不对劲？
What on Earth? What 's the matter?
Is anything wrong?

1437
02:00:14,714 --> 02:00:17,649
没什么，你是没什么 我帮你赢了打赌，不是吗？
No, nothing's wrong with you. I won your bet for you, haven't I?

1438
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:20,583
对你而言是有成就 我根本不重要吧？
That 's enough for you! I don't matter, I suppose?

1439
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:24,815
你帮我赢的？有没有弄错？ 是我自己赢的
You won my bet You presumptuous insect I won it

1440
02:00:24,924 --> 02:00:26,551
你为何用拖鞋丢我？
Why did you throw those slippers at me?

1441
02:00:26,659 --> 02:00:29,924
因为我想丢到你的脸上 杀死你这自私的家伙！
Because I wanted to smash your face. I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1442
02:00:30,029 --> 02:00:32,361
你当初为何不让我 留在贫民窟？
Why didn't you leave me where you picked me up, the gutter?

1443
02:00:32,465 --> 02:00:36,128
你感谢上帝一切都结束了 你现在就要送我回那里去吧？
You thank God it's all over. Now you ca throw me back again! Do you?

1444
02:00:36,335 --> 02:00:38,929
哦，原来你已经开始在紧张了
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1445
02:00:42,408 --> 02:00:44,740
收回你的猫爪 你竟敢如此对我？
Claws in, you cat! How dare you show your temper to me?

1446
02:00:44,844 --> 02:00:46,402
安静地坐下！
Sit down and be quiet

1447
02:00:46,512 --> 02:00:50,209
哦，我会变成如何？…
Oh, what 's to become of me? What 's to become of me?

1448
02:00:52,318 --> 02:00:55,515
我怎么会知道你会变得如何？ 那和我没关系
How the devil do I know what 's to become of you?
What does it matter?

1449
02:00:55,621 --> 02:00:58,488
你根本不在乎 我知道你根本不在乎我
You don't care. I know you don't care.

1450
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:00,852
你根本不管我的死活 我跟你毫无瓜葛
You wouldn't care if I was dead. I'm nothing to you.

1451
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,825
比拖鞋还不如
Not as much as them slippers

1452
02:01:02,928 --> 02:01:03,986
这些拖鞋！
Those slippers

1453
02:01:04,096 --> 02:01:07,759
这些拖鞋 我想现在根本没什么不同了
Those slippers I didn't think it meant any diference now.

1454
02:01:11,137 --> 02:01:13,571
你为何突然有如此的举动？
Why have you suddenly begun going on like this

1455
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,731
请教一下，你是否对这里 任何有不满之处？
May I ask if you complain of your treatment here?

1456
02:01:17,042 --> 02:01:17,736
没有

1457
02:01:17,843 --> 02:01:21,108
有人对你不好吗？ 平克林上校还是皮尔斯太太？
Has anybody behaved badly? Colonel Pickering, Mrs Pearce?

1458
02:01:21,213 --> 02:01:22,475
没有

1459
02:01:22,581 --> 02:01:26,142
你不会说是我对你不好吧？
Well you don't pretend that I have treated you badly?

1460
02:01:26,652 --> 02:01:27,346
不是
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1461
02:01:27,453 --> 02:01:29,444
这样就好

1462
02:01:30,556 --> 02:01:33,684
或许因为这几天训练得太累了
Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.

1463
02:01:34,059 --> 02:01:36,721
你要吃巧克力吗？
Would you have a chocolate?

1464
02:01:36,829 --> 02:01:39,764
不了，谢谢
No, thank you.

1465
02:01:41,434 --> 02:01:44,892
其实你应该高兴才对 都结束了
Well, it's only natural that you should be anxious, but it's all over now.

1466
02:01:45,438 --> 02:01:47,167
你没什么好担心了
Nothing more to worry about

1467
02:01:47,406 --> 02:01:50,273
不，是你不必再担心什么了
No, nothing more for you to worry about

1468
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:54,477
哦，天啊 我真希望我死掉算了
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1469
02:01:54,947 --> 02:01:57,507
为什么？到底是为了什么？
Why? In heaven's name, why?

1470
02:01:58,384 --> 02:02:02,013
听我说，伊莱莎 所有的烦躁都是个人因素
Now listen to me, Eliza All this irritation is purely subjective.

1471
02:02:02,488 --> 02:02:04,718
我不了解，我太无知了
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1472
02:02:04,824 --> 02:02:08,055
那只是幻想，并没有什么不对 没有人会伤害你的
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong. Nobody's hurting you.

1473
02:02:08,427 --> 02:02:14,161
你上床睡觉，好好哭一场 向上帝祷告，你会感觉好些的
Go to bed and sleep it of.Have a little cry and say your prayers You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1474
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:18,266
我听到你的祷告了 感谢上帝，一切都结束
I heard your prayers "Thank God it's all over."

1475
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:20,065
难道你不感谢上帝 这一切都结束了吗？
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1476
02:02:20,172 --> 02:02:22,572
你现在自由了 可以做你想做的任何事情
Now you're free, and you can do what you like.

1477
02:02:22,675 --> 02:02:25,974
哦，我适合做什么？ 你让我以后能做什么呢？
Oh, what am I fit for? What have you left me fit for?

1478
02:02:26,512 --> 02:02:29,379
我要何去何从？ 我会变成怎样呢？
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1479
02:02:29,915 --> 02:02:32,110
我会变成怎样呢？
And what 's to become of me?

1480
02:02:33,085 --> 02:02:36,054
哦，原来你是为此事烦恼
Oh, that 's what 's worrying you, is it

1481
02:02:37,523 --> 02:02:39,457
如果我是你 我才不会担心这个呢
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1482
02:02:39,558 --> 02:02:43,722
我相信你要找栖身之所 应该不会很困难的
I'm sure you won't have any dificulty in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1483
02:02:46,732 --> 02:02:48,893
我没想到你终究还是会离开的
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1484
02:02:50,436 --> 02:02:52,370
你有可能会结婚
You might marry, you know.

1485
02:02:52,771 --> 02:02:56,639
伊莱莎，并非每个男人 都像我和上校一样抱独身主义
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1486
02:02:56,775 --> 02:02:59,767
大部分的男人都会想结婚 可怜的家伙
Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils

1487
02:03:00,513 --> 02:03:04,244
你长的还不错 事实上你还真的很美
You're not bad -Iooking.You're really quite a pleasure to look at sometimes

1488
02:03:04,383 --> 02:03:07,580
当然不是现在，因为你哭了 你就像母夜叉一样，但是…
Not now, when you've been crying.You look like the very devil, but...

1489
02:03:07,686 --> 02:03:13,090
在平常的时候 你是相当吸引人的
when you're all right and quite yourself you're what I would call attractive.

1490
02:03:14,059 --> 02:03:16,391
你现去睡觉，好好地休息 早上起来之后…
Go to bed, have a good night's res get up in the morning...

1491
02:03:16,495 --> 02:03:19,726
看看镜中的自己 你就会感觉好一点了
and have a look at yourself in the glass You won't feel so bad.

1492
02:03:24,737 --> 02:03:28,332
也许我母亲 可以找到不错的年青人
I daresay, my mother might find some fellow or other who would do very well.

1493
02:03:28,674 --> 02:03:30,767
我们已经超越层级了
We were above that in Covent Garden.

1494
02:03:30,876 --> 02:03:32,343
你是什么意思？
What do you mea

1495
02:03:32,545 --> 02:03:35,070
我卖花，但我不卖身
Isold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1496
02:03:35,848 --> 02:03:38,942
现在你把我变成淑女 我什么都不能卖了
Now you've made a lady of me, I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1497
02:03:39,051 --> 02:03:41,679
哦，胡说，伊莱莎 不要看扁人们的关系
Oh, tosh, Eliza Don't insult human relations...

1498
02:03:41,787 --> 02:03:44,813
只会存在买卖的关系
by dragging all that cant about buying and selling into it

1499
02:03:44,924 --> 02:03:46,983
你不喜欢他，你不必嫁给他
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1500
02:03:47,092 --> 02:03:48,684
那我又能做些什么呢？
What else am I to do?

1501
02:03:48,794 --> 02:03:53,128
哦，很多事情 你以前想要开花店的啊
Oh, there are lots of things What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1502
02:03:53,232 --> 02:03:56,258
我相信平克林可以帮你的忙 他很有钱
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one. He's got lots of money.

1503
02:03:56,368 --> 02:04:02,500
今晚你穿戴的所有饰物 价值二百英镑都是他付的
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll make a big hole in 200 pounds

1504
02:04:02,708 --> 02:04:05,006
哦，拜托，你不会有事的
Oh, come on now. You'll be all right

1505
02:04:06,245 --> 02:04:09,146
我必须去睡了 我真的太想睡了
Well, I must be of to bed. I'm really devilish sleepy.

1506
02:04:10,749 --> 02:04:12,944
我不是在找东西吗？是什么？
I was looking for something. What was it

1507
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:14,312
你的拖鞋
Your slippers

1508
02:04:14,853 --> 02:04:17,583
哦，对了，你用它打我
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1509
02:04:18,724 --> 02:04:21,192
在你离开之前，先生
Before you go, sir.

1510
02:04:24,763 --> 02:04:27,755
我身上的衣服是属于我 还是平克林上校？
Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?

1511
02:04:28,834 --> 02:04:31,029
怎么会是平克林上校的呢？
What the devil use would they be to Pickering?

1512
02:04:31,136 --> 02:04:32,933
你干嘛在三更半夜问这些？
Why bother about that in the middle of the night

1513
02:04:33,038 --> 02:04:34,665
我要知道我能带走些什么？
What may I take away with me?

1514
02:04:34,773 --> 02:04:36,900
我不想被指控偷窃
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1515
02:04:37,843 --> 02:04:39,105
偷窃？
Stealing?

1516
02:04:40,012 --> 02:04:42,913
你不该这样说的 那表示占有的欲望
You shouldn't have said that. That shows a want of feeling.

1517
02:04:43,415 --> 02:04:45,474
抱歉 我只是个普通无知的村妇
I'm sorry. I'm only a common, ignorant girl and in my station I have to be careful.

1518
02:04:45,584 --> 02:04:47,484
我这种身分必须很小心

1519
02:04:47,586 --> 02:04:50,783
我们之间该不会 出现喜欢彼此的情感
There can' t be any feelings between the likes of you and the likes of me.

1520
02:04:50,889 --> 02:04:53,881
所以请告诉我，什么是我的 而那些不是？
Please, will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn 't

1521
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,460
如果你喜欢房子里 所有的东西都拿走
Take the whole damned houseful if you want.

1522
02:04:57,696 --> 02:05:00,028
除了那宝石是租来的以外 你满意了吗？
Except the jewelry. That 's hired. Will that satisfy you?

1523
02:05:00,132 --> 02:05:01,258
请等一下
Stop, please.

1524
02:05:03,802 --> 02:05:06,600
请把它带走，放在安全的地方
Will you take these to your room and keep them safe?

1525
02:05:07,673 --> 02:05:10,267
我不想要冒它们被偷的险
I don't want to run the ris of them being missed.

1526
02:05:12,177 --> 02:05:15,669
哦，拿给我吧！ 如果这些是我的又不是宝石…
Oh, hand them over! If these belonged to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1527
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:18,341
我会用它塞入 你那不知感恩的喉咙里
I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.

1528
02:05:18,651 --> 02:05:22,917
这戒指不是租的 是你在布莱顿买给我的
The ring isn 't the jeweler's It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1529
02:05:24,056 --> 02:05:25,614
我现在不想要了
I don't want it now.

1530
02:05:28,894 --> 02:05:30,555
别打我！
Don't you hit me!

1531
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:34,193
打你？你这个可恶的人 你竟敢这样说！
Hit you? You infamous creature! How dare you suggest such a thing!

1532
02:05:34,299 --> 02:05:36,927
是你要打我的 你存心要伤害我的
It's you who've hit me. You've wounded me to the heart

1533
02:05:37,036 --> 02:05:40,631
我真高兴我还保有我的心
I'm glad. I've got a little of my own back anyhow.

1534
02:05:42,007 --> 02:05:45,374
你令我生气 以前很少会发生这种事
You've caused me to lose my temper. That 's hardly happened to me before.

1535
02:05:45,477 --> 02:05:48,241
今晚我不想讨论了，我要睡了
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight I'm going to bed.

1536
02:05:48,347 --> 02:05:50,713
你最好自己留条子 给皮尔斯太太有关咖啡的事…
Leave your own note for Mrs Pearce about the cofee...

1537
02:05:50,816 --> 02:05:52,579
我是不会帮你写的
for it won't be done by me!

1538
02:05:52,685 --> 02:05:56,280
去他的皮尔斯太太 去他的咖啡还有去你的！
Damn Mrs Pearce, damn the cofee and damn you!

1539
02:05:57,523 --> 02:06:05,225
去我自己还慷慨用我的知识 帮助一位无情无义的流浪儿
Damn my own folly for having lavished my hard-earned knowledge...
and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1540
02:06:56,315 --> 02:07:01,014
等着看，席根斯，等着看
Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins Just you wait!

1541
02:07:02,888 --> 02:07:07,120
你会后悔 但你流泪也来不及了
You'll be sorry But your tears will be too late

1542
02:07:09,128 --> 02:07:16,125
你将会失败而无人可哭诉
You will be the one it's done toAnd you'll have no one to run to

1543
02:07:16,668 --> 02:07:18,226
等着看
Just you wait

1544
02:07:46,799 --> 02:07:52,431
我以前常在这条路上漫步
I have often walked Down this street before

1545
02:07:52,538 --> 02:07:58,340
但是脚下的步伐毫无特别
But the pavement always stayed Beneath my feet before

1546
02:07:58,443 --> 02:08:04,109
瞬时间我的思绪飞扬在空中
All at once am I Several stories high

1547
02:08:04,216 --> 02:08:10,052
知道这是你所住的街道
Knowing I'm on the street Where you live

1548
02:08:10,155 --> 02:08:15,957
丁香花不是在市中心吗？
Are there lilac trees In the heart of town?

1549
02:08:16,061 --> 02:08:21,897
听到云雀在城市中鸣叫？
Can you hear a lark In any other part of town?

1550
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,768
是否会迷倒所有的住户？
Does enchantment pour Out of every door?

1551
02:08:27,873 --> 02:08:33,743
不，只是因你住在此
No, it's just On the street where you live

1552
02:08:33,846 --> 02:08:45,917
知道你在附近 那感觉多么强烈
And, oh, the towering feelingJust to know Somehow you are near

1553
02:08:46,024 --> 02:08:51,121
无法抗拒的情感
The overpowering feeling

1554
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:57,328
因为你随时都会出现
That any second You may suddenly appear

1555
02:08:57,436 --> 02:09:02,032
我不在乎别人的注视
People stop and stare They don't...

1556
02:09:07,479 --> 02:09:08,446
亲爱的
Darling.

1557
02:09:09,948 --> 02:09:11,643
佛雷狄，你在这里干什么？
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1558
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:15,618
没事，我大部分的晚上都在此 因为我来这里会很快乐
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here. It's the only place where I'm happy.

1559
02:09:15,721 --> 02:09:17,313
不要取笑我，杜立特尔小姐
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1560
02:09:17,422 --> 02:09:21,358
别叫我杜立特尔小姐，听到没 叫我伊莱莎就好
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle," do you hear? Eliza' s good enough for me.

1561
02:09:23,695 --> 02:09:26,960
哦，佛雷狄，你认为我是个 无情无义的流浪儿吗？
Oh, Freddy, you don't think I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1562
02:09:27,366 --> 02:09:30,426
亲爱的，你怎会如此讲呢？ 你知道我对你的感受
Darling, how could you imagine such a thing? You know how I feel.

1563
02:09:30,535 --> 02:09:33,971
我一天写好几次的信告诉你 一张接一张
I've written two and three times a day telling you. Sheets and sheets.

1564
02:09:34,072 --> 02:09:37,530
你一开口，声音如同歌唱一般
Speak And the world is full of singing

1565
02:09:37,643 --> 02:09:42,876
我心也飞上天空 比鸟飞的还高
And I am winging Higher than the birds

1566
02:09:42,981 --> 02:09:46,781
你一摸，我的心就崩溃
Touch And my heart begins to crumble

1567
02:09:46,885 --> 02:09:50,719
天也塌了，亲爱的，我…
The heavens tumble Darling, and I'm...

1568
02:09:50,822 --> 02:09:53,950
文字…我痛恨文字
Words, words, words I'm so sick of words

1569
02:09:54,059 --> 02:09:57,222
我每天都听文字 先是他，现在是你
I get words all day through First from him, now from you

1570
02:09:57,329 --> 02:10:01,231
你们这些浑蛋只会用说的吗？
Is that all you blighters can do?

1571
02:10:02,034 --> 02:10:05,265
别谈星光在天空闪耀
Don't talk of stars burning above

1572
02:10:05,370 --> 02:10:08,567
如果你要恋爱，表现给我看
If you're in love, show me

1573
02:10:08,674 --> 02:10:11,837
别光说梦中充满欲望
Tell me no dreams filled with desire

1574
02:10:11,944 --> 02:10:15,209
如果你欲火焚身，表现给我看
If you're on fire, show me

1575
02:10:15,314 --> 02:10:17,748
我们现在三更半夜在一起
Here we are together In the middle of the night

1576
02:10:17,849 --> 02:10:21,808
别说春天，紧抱着我吧
Don't talk of spring Just hold me tight

1577
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:23,854
只要是恋爱过的人都知道
Anyone who's ever been in love'll Tell you that

1578
02:10:23,956 --> 02:10:26,823
现在不是聊天的时机
This is no time for a chat

1579
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,825
难道你不曾想要亲吻我吗？
Haven't your lips longed for my touch?

1580
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:34,990
不必说多少次，表现给我看
Don't say how much, show me

1581
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:36,727
表现给我看

1582
02:10:36,835 --> 02:10:40,293
别光谈不作，令时光飞逝
Don't talk of love lasting through time

1583
02:10:40,405 --> 02:10:43,340
别海誓山盟
Make me no undying vow

1584
02:10:43,442 --> 02:10:49,642
快表现给我看
Show me now

1585
02:10:49,915 --> 02:10:53,373
别唱情歌，别念诗韵
Sing me no song, read me no rhyme

1586
02:10:53,485 --> 02:10:56,852
别浪费时间，表现给我看
Don't waste my time, show me

1587
02:10:56,955 --> 02:11:00,220
别谈六月，别谈秋天
Don't talk of June, don't talk of Fall

1588
02:11:00,325 --> 02:11:03,624
什么都别谈，表现给我看
Don't talk at all, show me

1589
02:11:03,729 --> 02:11:06,163
我再也不想听到任何的字眼
Never do I ever Want to hear another word

1590
02:11:06,264 --> 02:11:10,360
我全都已经学过了
There isn't one I haven't heard

1591
02:11:10,469 --> 02:11:12,903
我们在一起有如梦幻一般
Here we are together In what ought to be a dream

1592
02:11:13,005 --> 02:11:17,066
你再说一字，我就尖叫
Say one more word and I'll scream

1593
02:11:17,175 --> 02:11:20,508
难道你不曾想拥抱我？
Haven't your arms hungered for mine?

1594
02:11:20,612 --> 02:11:23,775
请别再解释，表现给我看
Please don't explain, show me

1647
02:16:00,358 --> 02:16:01,757
假装你好像不知道
As if you didn't know.

1648
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:05,694
回到温普街恶魔的身边 告诉他对我做的好事
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil. Tell him what he's done to me.

1649
02:16:06,064 --> 02:16:07,554
他对你做了什么？
What 's he done to you?

1650
02:16:08,099 --> 02:16:09,361
把我彻底地毁了！
Ruined me, that 's all.

1651
02:16:09,467 --> 02:16:13,164
让我被中产阶级的道德所束缚
Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle-class morality.

1652
02:16:13,705 --> 02:16:15,070
你休想替他辩护
And don't you defend him.

1653
02:16:15,173 --> 02:16:19,337
他写信给一个讨厌的 美国百万富翁以斯拉
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to a old American blighter named Wallingford...

1654
02:16:19,778 --> 02:16:24,147
那个人拿出五百万基金 成立道德改革会
who was giving five millions to found Moral Reform societies...

1655
02:16:24,449 --> 02:16:28,818
告诉他说亚尔杜立特尔 是英国最好的道德家
to tell him the most original moralis in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1656
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,587
一位普通的清洁工？
a common dustma

1657
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:33,748
听起来好像是他开的一个玩笑
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1658
02:16:34,292 --> 02:16:37,193
你说是玩笑，我却惨了，真的
You may call it a j It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1659
02:16:37,829 --> 02:16:42,061
老家伙死了还立遗嘱说 每年要给我四千英镑
The old bloke died and left me 4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1660
02:16:43,501 --> 02:16:47,597
谁请他把我变成为绅士？ 我很快乐，我很自由
Who asked him to make a gentleman outta me? I was happy. I was free.

1661
02:16:48,206 --> 02:16:52,142
我没有钱时 我晚上可以找人要
Itouched pretty nigh everyone for money when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1662
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:56,105
现在我穿戴整齐 换成别人来找我
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels and everybody touches me.

1663
02:16:56,815 --> 02:16:59,716
一年前我跟这世界毫无瓜葛
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1664
02:17:00,418 --> 02:17:02,477
除了一两个不太搭理我的人
except one or two who wouldn't speak to me.

1665
02:17:02,587 --> 02:17:06,114
现在我有五十个亲戚 每个星期固定资助他们
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages amongst the 'ot of them.

1666
02:17:06,858 --> 02:17:11,522
哦，我现在要为旁人而活 并非为自己了，中产阶级道德
Oh, I have to live for others now, not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1667
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:15,529
快点，亚尔 再几小时就得去教堂了
Come on, Alfile, in a couple of hours we have to be at the church.

1668
02:17:15,633 --> 02:17:17,999
教堂？ 对，去教堂
- Church? - Yeah, church.

1669
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:20,770
最严重的后果
The deepest cut of all.

1670
02:17:21,272 --> 02:17:24,298
你以为我穿戴整齐 像出殡一样要干嘛？
Why do you think I'm dressed up like a ruddy pallbearer?

1671
02:17:25,043 --> 02:17:26,874
你的继母要嫁给我了
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1672
02:17:27,011 --> 02:17:30,037
我现在受人尊敬 她想要和我一样受人尊敬
Now I'm respectable, she wants to be respectable.

1673
02:17:30,148 --> 02:17:33,515
如果你不爽？ 为何不把钱还给他呢？
If that 's the way you feel about it, why don't you give the money back?

1674
02:17:33,618 --> 02:17:35,552
这就是最悲哀的一点，伊莱莎
That 's the tragedy of it, Eliza

1675
02:17:35,954 --> 02:17:40,288
说得容易，但我却没那胆量
It's easy to say chuck it...but I 'aven't the nerve.

1676
02:17:40,825 --> 02:17:43,453
我们以前每天朝不保夕
We're all intimidated. That 's what we are, intimidated.

1677
02:17:43,561 --> 02:17:46,223
现在我觉得我自己被收买了
Bought up. Yeah. That 's what I am.

1678
02:17:46,965 --> 02:17:49,490
这都要怪你珍爱的教授所赐予
That 's what your precious professor's brought me to.

1679
02:17:49,734 --> 02:17:51,702
他不是我珍爱的教授
Not my precious professor.

1680
02:17:52,437 --> 02:17:54,337
哦，他把你送回来了？
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1681
02:17:56,007 --> 02:18:01,445
他先把我推进中产阶级 然后又把你送回来让我养
First he shoves me in the middle-class, then he chucks you out for me to support

1682
02:18:01,546 --> 02:18:03,377
这都是他计划的一部分
That 's all part of his pla...

1683
02:18:04,182 --> 02:18:05,911
但是你出卖他了
but you double-cross him.

1684
02:18:06,684 --> 02:18:10,848
别想回家找我 我一毛钱都不会给你
Don't you come back home to me. Don't you take tuppence from me.

1685
02:18:11,456 --> 02:18:14,653
你现在是淑女了 可以自力更生了
You stand on your own two feet You're a lady now, you can do it

1686
02:18:15,093 --> 02:18:18,256
对，没错，伊莱莎 你现在是淑女了
Yeah, that 's right, Eliza You're a lady now.

1687
02:18:18,696 --> 02:18:20,755
伊莱莎，计程车等很久了
Eliza, it's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1688
02:18:20,865 --> 02:18:24,665
伊莱莎 你想要来看我的结婚典礼吗？
Here, Eliza, would you like to come and see me turned of this morning? Eh?

1689
02:18:25,069 --> 02:18:27,697
十点在汉诺威广场的 圣乔治教堂
St George's, Hanover Square, ten o'clock.

1690
02:18:27,806 --> 02:18:29,797
我不勉强你 但是你随时都可以来
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

1691
02:18:29,908 --> 02:18:31,273
不了，谢谢，父亲
No, thank you, Dad.

1692
02:18:32,577 --> 02:18:34,340
你的事情都办完了吗 伊莱莎？
Are you all finished here, Eliza

1693
02:18:35,346 --> 02:18:38,338
是的，佛雷狄，办完了
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

1694

1697
02:19:04,242 --> 02:19:06,005
我还剩多少时间？
How much time have I got left?

1698
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:11,548
你只剩几个钟头了

1699

A few more hours Before they tie the knot

1700

在伦敦有那么多的酒和女人
There's drinks and girls All over London

1701
02:19:20,992 --> 02:19:24,758

Last night Mrs Pearce let her go without telling me a thing about it

1773
02:25:15,246 --> 02:25:18,545
昨晚皮尔斯太太让她走了 竟然完全没有告诉我

1774
02:25:18,649 --> 02:25:20,742
我怎么办？ 我早上要喝茶不喝咖啡
What am I to do? I got tea this morning instead of cofee.

1775
02:25:20,852 --> 02:25:22,649
我不知东西放在那 我有哪些会议要参加
I don't know where anything is, what my appointments are.

1776
02:25:22,753 --> 02:25:25,688
伊莱莎知道 该死，她走了啊！
- Eliza' d know. - Damn it, she's gone!

1777
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:28,020
你们两位是否 昨晚把她吓着了？
Did either of you gentlemen frighten her last night

1778
02:25:28,125 --> 02:25:30,116
我们根本没有跟她说话 你也在场
We hardly said a word to her. You were there.

1779
02:25:30,228 --> 02:25:31,820
我去睡觉后你又凶她了吗？
Did you bully her after I went to bed?

1780
02:25:31,929 --> 02:25:33,692
相反地，她用拖鞋丢我
She threw the slippers at me.

1781
02:25:33,798 --> 02:25:38,064
我根本没有惹她 我还没说话拖鞋就打到我的头
I never gave her the slightest provocation.
The slippers came bang at my head before I uttered a word.

1782
02:25:38,169 --> 02:25:42,230
她用最恶毒的话骂我 我吓一跳，我完全不懂
She used the most disgraceful language. I was shocked! I don't understand it

1783
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:44,808
我们对她照顾周详 她自己也承认
We always gave her every consideration. She admitted it

1784
02:25:44,909 --> 02:25:45,739
我毫无概念！
I'm dashed!

1785
02:25:45,843 --> 02:25:49,335
哦，平克林，快想些办法啊 什么办法？
Oh, Pickering, for God's sake, stop being dashed and do something!

1786
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,074
打电话报警啊，不都是这样吗
Phone the police. What are they there for in heaven's name?

1787
02:25:52,183 --> 02:25:54,674
席根斯 不能把伊莱莎的名字告诉警察
You can' t give Eliza' s name to the police...

1788
02:25:54,785 --> 02:25:56,878
好像她是小偷或偷了东西似的
as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella

1789
02:25:56,988 --> 02:26:01,254
为何不行？我要找到那女孩 她是我的，我付了5英镑
But why not I want to find the girl. She belongs to me. I paid five pounds for her.

1790
02:26:01,959 --> 02:26:04,621
没错，请帮我接苏格兰警场
Quite right Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1791
02:26:05,062 --> 02:26:06,962
给我杯咖啡，好吗？ 是的
Get me some cofee, would you please?

1792
02:26:07,064 --> 02:26:09,294
苏格兰警场
Scotland Yard?

1793
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:17,774
对不起，我是平克林上校 住温普街27号A
I beg your pardon, yes This is, this is Colonel Pickering speaking.27 A Wimpole Street

1794
02:26:18,276 --> 02:26:20,506
我要报案，是人口失踪
I want to report a missing person.

1795
02:26:21,178 --> 02:26:24,375
伊莱莎杜立特尔小姐
Miss Eliza Doolittle.

1796
02:26:24,482 --> 02:26:25,449
年约21岁
About 21.

1797
02:26:26,651 --> 02:26:29,518
哦，身高我想是五尺七英寸
Oh, I should say about 5 foot 7.

1798
02:26:30,755 --> 02:26:34,714
眼睛的颜色？ 让我想想，眼睛…
Her eyes Let me think now. Her eyes Her eyes- -

1799
02:26:35,059 --> 02:26:36,822
褐色 褐色
- Brown. - Brown.

1800
02:26:39,563 --> 02:26:44,262
头发颜色？哦，天啊 很难区分…
Her hair? Oh, good Lord. Well, sort of nondescript neutral sort of- -

1801
02:26:44,368 --> 02:26:45,995
褐色…！
Brown, brown, brown!

1802
02:26:46,103 --> 02:26:48,571
你你听到了吗？褐色…是的
You heard what he said? Brown, brown, brown, yes

1803
02:26:48,873 --> 02:26:51,307
不…这里是…
No, no, no. This is her residence. 27 A...

1804
02:26:51,442 --> 02:26:55,242
是，大约是今天凌晨 三点至四点间
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00 this morning, I understand.

1805
02:26:56,414 --> 02:27:00,350
不…她不是亲戚，不是，什么
No, no, no... No, she's no relation, no.

1806
02:27:00,451 --> 02:27:03,249
她就是我们很好的朋友
Well, just let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1807
02:27:03,854 --> 02:27:05,116
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

1808
02:27:05,423 --> 02:27:08,153
听着，我不喜欢你问的问题
Listen to me, my man, I don't like the tenor of that question.

1809
02:27:08,259 --> 02:27:10,819
她在此干嘛是我们的私事
What the girl does here is our affair.

1810
02:27:11,929 --> 02:27:15,421
你们的职责就是尽快找到她
Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it

1811
02:27:16,033 --> 02:27:17,523
我真的昏头了
Well, I'm dashed!

1812
02:27:20,071 --> 02:27:23,040
真不知道她为何要走？
What in all, in heaven Could have prompted her to go?

1813
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:25,233
在舞会表现成功之后
After such a triumph at the ball

1814
02:27:26,177 --> 02:27:27,667
何事让她沮丧？
What could have depressed her?

1815
02:27:27,778 --> 02:27:31,373
她执着些什么？ 我真的毫无头绪
What could have possessed her? I cannot understand the wretch at all

1816
02:27:33,918 --> 02:27:37,945
席根斯，我在内政部有朋友 或许他能帮忙
Higgins, I have an old school chum at the Home Ofice. Perhaps he could help.

1817
02:27:38,122 --> 02:27:39,612
我该打个电话给他
Think I'll give him a ring.

1818
02:27:41,525 --> 02:27:44,289
请接白厅7244号
Whitehall: 7244, please.

1819
02:27:46,897 --> 02:27:49,422
女人根本毫无理性可言
Women are irrational That's all there is to that

1820
02:27:49,633 --> 02:27:51,897
脑袋装的是浆糊
Their heads are full of Cotton, hay and rags

1821
02:27:52,737 --> 02:27:56,468
女人是令人恼怒，令人生气 犹豫不决，工于心计
They're nothing but exasperating Irritating, vacillating, calculating

1822
02:27:56,574 --> 02:27:59,304
激动，疯狂，易怒的臭婆娘
Agitating, maddening And infuriating hags

1823
02:28:00,845 --> 02:28:04,178
我想和布鲁斯特巴金先生说话
I want to speak to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

1824
02:28:04,982 --> 02:28:06,415
好的，我会等的
Yes, I'll wait

1825
02:28:11,789 --> 02:28:16,158
平克林 为何女人不能像男人一般？
Pickering, why can' t a woman be more like a man?

1826
02:28:16,694 --> 02:28:17,820
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

1827
02:28:18,429 --> 02:28:21,728
是啊 为何女人不能像男人一般？
Yes, why can' t a woman be more like a man?

1828
02:28:22,633 --> 02:28:29,095
男人诚实，公正，高贵，公平
Men are so honest, so thoroughly squareEternally noble, historically fair

1829
02:28:29,206 --> 02:28:32,369
是谁在赢得胜利 会鼓励手下败将？
Who, when you win Will always give your back a pat?

1830
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:35,707
为何女人不能像那样呢？
Why can't a woman be like that?

1831
02:28:36,247 --> 02:28:39,614
为何都要相互模仿？
Why does every one do What the others do?

1832
02:28:39,717 --> 02:28:42,982
难道女人没有大脑？
Can't a woman learn to use her head?

1833
02:28:43,087 --> 02:28:45,988
为何她们都照母亲的指示做？
Why do they do everything Their mothers do?

1834
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:49,491
为何她们长大不能像父亲？
Why don't they grow up Well, like their father instead?

1835
02:28:49,593 --> 02:28:52,653
为何女人不能向男人学习？
Why can't a woman take after a man?

1836
02:28:52,763 --> 02:28:55,960
男人很和蔼，容易取悦
Men are so pleasant, so easy to please

1837
02:28:56,067 --> 02:28:59,298
当你跟他们一起，都很轻松
Whenever you're with them You're always at ease

1838
02:28:59,403 --> 02:29:01,803
如果我一下子没跟你说话 你会觉得受轻视吗？
Would you be slighted If I didn't speak for hours?

1839
02:29:01,906 --> 02:29:02,736
当然不会

1840
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:04,808
如果我喝一两杯 你会发怒吗？
Would you be livid If I had a drink or two?

1841
02:29:04,909 --> 02:29:05,898
别胡扯

1842
02:29:06,010 --> 02:29:08,274
如果我没送你花 你会不会心碎？
Would you be wounded If I never sent you flowers?

1843
02:29:08,379 --> 02:29:09,038
不会吧！

1844
02:29:09,146 --> 02:29:12,343
为何女人不能像你一般？
Well, why can't a woman be like you?

1845
02:29:13,117 --> 02:29:15,915
或许百万人中会有一人不同
One man in a million may shout a bit

1846
02:29:16,487 --> 02:29:19,251
多多少少会有一个瑕疵
Now and then There's one with slight defects

1847
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:22,384
或许有一人的真诚值得你怀疑
One perhaps whose truthfulness You doubt a bit

1848
02:29:22,493 --> 02:29:26,452
但是大多数而言 我们是优秀的男人
But by and large We are a marvelous sex

1849
02:29:26,564 --> 02:29:29,556
为何女人不能向男人学习？
Why can't a woman take after a man?

1850
02:29:29,667 --> 02:29:32,830
因为男人是友善的 有善良的性质，善解人意
Cause men are so friendly Good-natured and kind

1851
02:29:32,937 --> 02:29:36,270
找不到这么好的朋友
A better companion You never will find

1852
02:29:36,373 --> 02:29:38,864
如果我迟点回家吃晚饭 你会对我咆哮吗？
If I were hours late for dinner Would you bellow?

1853
02:29:38,976 --> 02:29:39,704
当然不会

1854
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:41,801
如果我忘记你的生日 你会大惊小怪吗？
If I forgot your silly birthday Would you fuss?

1855
02:29:41,912 --> 02:29:42,742
别胡扯

1856
02:29:42,847 --> 02:29:45,042
如果我跟另外一个人出去 你会抱怨吗？
Would you complain If I took out another fellow?

1857
02:29:45,149 --> 02:29:45,945
不会！

1858
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:49,383
为何女人不能像我们一般
Well, why can't a woman be like us?

1859
02:29:52,423 --> 02:29:53,720
布鲁斯特巴金先生在吗？
Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

1860
02:29:54,925 --> 02:29:59,328
布鲁斯，哦，布鲁斯 你绝对猜不着我是谁
Bruzzie. Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is

1861
02:30:00,564 --> 02:30:04,295
没错，天啊，你的记性真好
You're quite right, it is Good heavens By George, what a memory.

1862
02:30:05,436 --> 02:30:08,405
你好吗，布鲁斯？ 真高兴听到你的声音
How are you, Bruzzie? Nice to hear your voice.

1863
02:30:09,173 --> 02:30:12,142
什么？真的吗 30年没见了，布鲁斯？
What? You don't say. Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?

1864
02:30:12,943 --> 02:30:14,171
没错，相隔太远了
Quite right Yes, oceans of water.

1865
02:30:14,278 --> 02:30:16,542
听着，布鲁斯 有件事要拜托你
Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.

1866
02:30:16,647 --> 02:30:20,378
有件不太好的事发生 我可否去找你？
Something rather unpleasant happened at this end. Could I come and see you?

1867
02:30:20,484 --> 02:30:22,475
可以，好，我马上过去
Well, I could, yes Now, straight away?

1868
02:30:22,586 --> 02:30:23,746
对，很好，谢谢
Right Good. Thank you.

1869
02:30:23,854 --> 02:30:25,913
再见，布鲁斯，非常感谢
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.

1870
02:30:33,397 --> 02:30:36,195
皮尔斯太太，我去内政部一下
Mrs Pearce, I'm going along to the Home Ofice.

1871
02:30:36,934 --> 02:30:39,232
我真的很希望你找到她 平克林上校
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

1872
02:30:39,336 --> 02:30:41,031
席根斯先生很想她的
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

1873
02:30:41,138 --> 02:30:45,370
席根斯先生很想她的？ 管他席根斯先生，我也想念她
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh? Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!

1874
02:30:47,578 --> 02:30:48,943
平克林？

1875
02:30:51,182 --> 02:30:52,615
平克林？

1876
02:30:56,887 --> 02:30:59,117
皮尔斯太太？ 是的，先生
- Mrs Pearce? - Yes, sir.

1877
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:00,357
上校去哪里了？
Where's the Colonel?

1878
02:31:00,457 --> 02:31:03,255
他去内政部了
He's gone to the Home Ofice, sir.

1879
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:09,458
你看看，我有麻烦他就帮忙 他真是我的好朋友
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs for help. Now there's a good fellow.

1880
02:31:10,501 --> 02:31:13,766
皮尔斯太太，你是一个女人
Mrs Pearce, you're a woman.

1881
02:31:14,171 --> 02:31:17,800
为何女人不能像男人一般？
Why can't a woman be more like a man?

1882
02:31:17,908 --> 02:31:21,002
男人如此正派，标准的典型
Men are so decent Such regular chaps

1883
02:31:21,111 --> 02:31:24,274
只要你有麻烦，随时都会帮你
Ready to help you Through any mishaps

1884
02:31:24,381 --> 02:31:27,441
只要你沮丧，随时都会振作你
Ready to buck you up Whenever you are glum

1885
02:31:27,551 --> 02:31:30,987
为何女人不能像男人？
Why can't a woman be a chum?

1886
02:31:31,488 --> 02:31:34,787
为何女人不会思考？
Why is thinking Something women never do?

1887
02:31:34,892 --> 02:31:38,020
为何不会逻辑推理？
And why is logic never even tried?

1888
02:31:38,128 --> 02:31:41,063
只会整理她们的头发
Straightening up their hair Is all they ever do

1889
02:31:41,165 --> 02:31:44,692
为何不整理脑袋里的思绪？
Why don't they straighten up The mess that's inside?

1890
02:31:44,802 --> 02:31:47,862
为何女人的行为不能像男人？
Why can't a woman behave like a man?

1891
02:31:47,972 --> 02:31:51,135
如果我是参加舞会的女人
If I was a woman Who'd been to a ball

1892
02:31:51,242 --> 02:31:54,439
每个人待我像公主
Been hailed as a princess By one and by all

1893
02:31:54,545 --> 02:31:57,605
我是否会痛哭流涕？
Would I start weeping Like a bathtub overflowing?

1894
02:31:57,715 --> 02:32:00,707
或是无法住在这栋房子里？
Or carry on as if my home Were in a tree?

1895
02:32:00,818 --> 02:32:03,878
我会不说一句走跑走吗？
Would I run off And never tell me where I'm going?

1896
02:32:03,988 --> 02:32:07,685
为何女人不像我呢？
Why can't a woman be like me?

1897
02:32:11,295 --> 02:32:15,732
你是说在你替他完成了 这项不可思议的任务后
You mean that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them...without making a mistake...

1898
02:32:15,833 --> 02:32:17,801
他们只是坐下来 没跟你说一句话？
they just sat there and never said a word?

1899
02:32:17,901 --> 02:32:21,701
没有称赞你，说你有多棒吗？
Never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you'd been?

1900
02:32:21,805 --> 02:32:22,669
一个字都没有
Not a word.

1901
02:32:22,773 --> 02:32:25,742
他们只是互相庆贺 完成了一件多么不可思议的事
They just congratulated each other on how marvelous they'd been.

1902
02:32:25,843 --> 02:32:28,311
然后庆幸这一切都过去了
The next moment, how glad they were it was all over...

1903
02:32:28,412 --> 02:32:30,209
这舞会的过程有多无聊
and what a bore it had all been.

1904
02:32:30,314 --> 02:32:33,340
这太不像话了 我不会只用拖鞋丢他
This is simply appalling. I should not have thrown my slippers at him.

1905
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:35,441
我会用火戳丢他
Ishould have thrown the fire irons

1906
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:37,044
是谁？
Who's that?

1907
02:32:37,321 --> 02:32:40,017
是亨利，我知道这不会很久的
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

1908
02:32:41,625 --> 02:32:42,853
要记住…
Now, remember...

1909
02:32:43,727 --> 02:32:47,561
你不只是昨晚跟王子跳舞 现在也要像是公主一般
you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess.

1910
02:32:54,938 --> 02:32:57,236
母亲，真令人不解…
Mother, the most confounded thing... Do you...

1911
02:33:01,211 --> 02:33:02,235
是你！
You!

1912
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:05,642
午安，席根斯教授 你还好吧？
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins Are you quite well?

1913
02:33:07,551 --> 02:33:11,817
当然好，你从来没病过 你要喝茶吗？
Of course you are. You are never ill. Would you care for some tea

1914
02:33:12,456 --> 02:33:15,448
休想和我玩这把戏 是我教你这一切的
Don't you dare try that game on me. Itaught it to you.

1915
02:33:15,659 --> 02:33:17,183
起来，跟我回去 别像傻子一样
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

1916
02:33:17,294 --> 02:33:18,784
你已经惹了不少麻烦
You've caused me enough trouble.

1917
02:33:18,896 --> 02:33:22,889
真的是这样，亨利 没有女人能拒绝这种邀约的
Very nicely put indeed, Henry. No woman could resist such an invitation.

1918
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,763
这些袋子怎么会在这里？
How did this baggage get here?

1919
02:33:24,868 --> 02:33:27,803
伊莱莎今早到这里来看我 我很高兴见到她
Eliza came to see me this morning and I was delighted to have her.

1920
02:33:27,905 --> 02:33:30,635
如果你不能乖乖的 我就要请你离开了
If you don't promise to behave yourself lmust as you to leave.

1921
02:33:30,741 --> 02:33:36,611
你是说我必须要对我所训练的菜市场女人举止合宜吗？
You mean, I'm to put on my Sunday manners for this...thing that I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

1922
02:33:36,714 --> 02:33:38,079
我就是这个意思
That 's precisely what I mean

1923
02:33:38,182 --> 02:33:40,150
真是不可理喻！

1924
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:42,946
你是如何从我儿子那里 学习当个淑女的？
However did you learn good manners with my son around?

1925
02:33:43,554 --> 02:33:49,652
实在很困难，如果不是上校 我无法学会淑女和绅士的相处
It was very dificult I should never have known how ladies...
and gentlemen behave if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

1926
02:33:52,229 --> 02:33:57,030
他让我感受到 我并非只是个卖花女
He showed me that he felt and thought about me...as if I were something better than a common flower girl.

1927
02:34:00,371 --> 02:34:03,534
席根斯夫人 有许多事情让人们可以学到…
You see, Mrs Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up...

1928
02:34:04,308 --> 02:34:07,835
淑女和卖花女的差别 并非在言行
the diference between a lady and a flower girl isn 't how she behaves...

1929
02:34:07,945 --> 02:34:09,572
而是人们对待她的态度
but how she is treated.

1930
02:34:12,649 --> 02:34:18,053
在教授眼中我永远是个卖花女 因为他待我像卖花女
Ishall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins...
because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.

1931
02:34:19,456 --> 02:34:24,450
而在上校眼中我永远是个淑女 因为他待我像是淑女
I know I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...
because he always treats me as a lady and always will.

1932
02:34:29,867 --> 02:34:31,300
亨利，不要在那里磨牙
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

1933
02:34:31,402 --> 02:34:34,200
夫人，主教来了 要我带他去花园吗？
The bishop is here, Madam. Shall I show him into the garden?

1934
02:34:34,304 --> 02:34:36,704
主教和教授？天啊，不要！
The bishop and the professor? Good heavens, no!

1935
02:34:36,907 --> 02:34:38,670
我会被逐出教会的
Ishould be excommunicated.

1936
02:34:39,009 --> 02:34:40,670
我在书房见他
I'll see him in the library.

1937
02:34:41,712 --> 02:34:47,048
伊莱莎，如果我儿子不讲理 你可以赶他出去
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...I give you full permission to have him evicted.

1938
02:34:47,351 --> 02:34:51,720
亨利，我建议你谈两个话题 天气和健康
Henry dear, I suggest you stick to two subjects: The weather and your health.

1939
02:35:19,416 --> 02:35:21,407
你可以在自由意愿下回去
You've had a bit of your own back, as you say.

1940
02:35:21,518 --> 02:35:25,147
你玩够了没，你可以讲理了吗 还是要继续玩下去？
Have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more?

1941
02:35:25,255 --> 02:35:27,018
你是要我回去帮你拿拖鞋
You want me back to pick up your slippers...

1942
02:35:27,124 --> 02:35:30,116
忍受你的脾气 然后料理你的杂事
and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.

1943
02:35:30,227 --> 02:35:31,819
我没有说我要你回来
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

1944
02:35:31,929 --> 02:35:33,487
真的吗？ 那我们还谈个什么劲？
Indeed? Then what are we talking about

1945
02:35:33,597 --> 02:35:35,258
是谈你，不是谈我
Well, about you, not about me.

1946
02:35:35,499 --> 02:35:37,763
如果你回来 我对你的态度与往常一般
If you come back you'll be treated as you've always been.

1947
02:35:37,868 --> 02:35:40,302
我不需要改变我的态度
I can' t change my nature or my manners

1948
02:35:40,404 --> 02:35:43,202
我的态度 跟平克林上校的是一样
My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's

1949
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:46,605
那不是事实 他对待卖花女好似伯爵夫人
That 's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess.

1950
02:35:47,277 --> 02:35:49,472
而我对待伯爵夫人 好似个卖花女
And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.

1951
02:35:49,580 --> 02:35:51,377
哦，原来如此，一视同仁
Oh, I see. The same to everybody.

1952
02:35:51,482 --> 02:35:58,513
没错，重点不是 对某种人态度会有不同
You see, the great secret is not a question of good manners...or bad manners or any particular sort of manners...

1953
02:35:59,022 --> 02:36:02,719
而是对所有人的态度都相同
but having the same manner for all human souls

1954
02:36:04,261 --> 02:36:06,661
问题不是我对你很无礼
The question is not whether I treat you rudely...

1955
02:36:06,763 --> 02:36:09,789
而是你有看过我对任何人好吗
but whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better.

1956
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:12,427
我不在乎你如何对待我
I don't care how you treat me.

1957
02:36:12,536 --> 02:36:15,164
我不介意你用粗话骂我 我不介意自己丢脸
I don't mind your swearing at me. Ishouldn't mind a black eye.

1958
02:36:15,272 --> 02:36:18,673
我曾经体会过 但是我不喜欢被忽视！
I've had one before this But I won't be passed over!

1959
02:36:18,775 --> 02:36:20,640
别挡路 我不会因你而停下来改变
Get out of my way, for I won't stop for you.

1960
02:36:20,744 --> 02:36:22,644
你说的我好像是部公车
You talk about me as though I was a motorbus

1961
02:36:22,746 --> 02:36:26,910
你就是公车 只会来回的开不管乘客是谁
So you are a motorbus All bounce and go and no consideration for anybody.

1962
02:36:27,417 --> 02:36:30,147
别以为我没有你就无法生存
But I can get along without you. Don't you think I can' t

1963
02:36:30,254 --> 02:36:32,279
我知道你办得到 我说过你行的
I know you ca I told you, you could.

1964
02:36:36,093 --> 02:36:38,323
你从未想过，我觉得…
You've never wondered, I suppose, whether...

1965
02:36:38,762 --> 02:36:40,992
我是否能没有你呢？
whether I could get along without you?

1966
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:45,425
别想要改变我的想法 你必须要做到
Don't you try to get around me. You'll have to.

1967
02:36:46,637 --> 02:36:48,901
所以我可以，没有你或任何人 我都可以活得下去
So I can, without you or any soul on Earth.

1968
02:36:52,409 --> 02:36:56,812
我会想念你的，伊莱莎 我从你身上也学了不少东西
Ishall miss you, Eliza I've learned something from your idiotic notions

1969
02:36:57,281 --> 02:36:59,943
我必须承认我由衷地感激
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

1970
02:37:02,786 --> 02:37:05,152
你的留声机里有我的声音
Well, you have my voice on your gramophone.

1971
02:37:05,255 --> 02:37:09,521
寂寞的时候可以打开听听 不会伤感的
When you feel lonely without me you ca turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt

1972
02:37:11,261 --> 02:37:14,196
我却无法敞开你的心灵
Well, I can' t turn your soul on.

1973
02:37:16,667 --> 02:37:18,931
哦，你真是个魔鬼
Oh, you are a devil!

1974
02:37:19,903 --> 02:37:24,704
你还真会伤女孩的心
You can twist the heart in a girl just as easily...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

1975
02:37:25,042 --> 02:37:26,737
我还回去干什么？
What am I to come back for?

1976
02:37:27,177 --> 02:37:29,236
为了乐趣，所以我才选了你
For the fun of it That 's why I took you on.

1977
02:37:29,346 --> 02:37:31,871
如果我不照你意思做 我就会被你赶出去
You may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want.

1978
02:37:31,982 --> 02:37:35,611
但是我没照你的意思做事 你也可以马上离开我
Yes And you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want.

1979
02:37:35,719 --> 02:37:36,879
去和我父亲住一起吗？
And live with my father?

1980
02:37:36,987 --> 02:37:39,319
是，或去卖花 还是你宁愿和上校结婚
Yes, or sell flowers Would you rather marry Pickering?

1981
02:37:39,423 --> 02:37:43,291
如果你向我求婚我就嫁给你 起码年纪相近
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age then what he is

1982
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,228
我喜欢说什么我就说 你已经不是我老师了
I'll talk as I like. You're not my teacher now.

1983
02:37:46,763 --> 02:37:49,231
结婚不是我想要的 你不用这样想
That 's not what I want and don't you think it is

1984
02:37:49,666 --> 02:37:51,896
我有许多人在追求我
I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way.

1985
02:37:52,002 --> 02:37:55,062
佛雷狄希尔 一天就写好几封信给我
Freddy Hill writes me twice and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

1986
02:37:55,172 --> 02:37:58,869
搞半天，原来你要我 像他对你一般痴情
In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is, is that it

1987
02:37:59,242 --> 02:38:03,235
不是，我不是要你如此对待我
No, I don't That 's not the sort of feeling I want from you.

1988
02:38:04,314 --> 02:38:05,838
我只求你待我亲切一些
I want a little kindness.

1989
02:38:06,683 --> 02:38:09,982
我知道我是微不足道的卖花女 你是丰富学识的绅士
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl, and you're a book-learned gentleman...

1990
02:38:10,087 --> 02:38:12,248
但我不是你脚下的烂泥
but I'm not dirt under your feet

1991
02:38:12,789 --> 02:38:17,920
我所做的并非是为了物质享受
What I done... what I did was not for the taxis and the dresses...

1992
02:38:18,195 --> 02:38:22,256
只是因为我们在一起 相处的很愉快，我就…
but because we were pleasant together and I come to... came...

1993
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:24,599
关心你
to care for you.

1994
02:38:25,235 --> 02:38:26,566
并非想要跟你结婚
Not to want you to make love to me...

1995
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:29,298
也没忘记你我身分的悬殊 但是…
and not forgetting the diference between us, but...

1996
02:38:30,073 --> 02:38:31,938
只希望我们能更像朋友一样
more friendly like.

1997
02:38:33,944 --> 02:38:36,242
当然，我的想法也和你一样
Well, of course. That 's how I feel.

1998
02:38:36,813 --> 02:38:40,613
上校也如此想 伊莱莎，你真傻
And how Pickering feels Eliza, you're a fool!

1999
02:38:40,717 --> 02:38:42,082
这样回答太不合宜了
That 's not the proper answer.

2000
02:38:42,185 --> 02:38:43,880
除非你变聪明 否则还是这样的回答
It's the only answer till you stop being a idiot

2001
02:38:43,987 --> 02:38:46,114
如果你要成为淑女 就必须独立自主
If you want to be a lady, you must stop feeling neglected...

2002
02:38:46,223 --> 02:38:50,751
如果男人不会在你身边哭诉 不会让你丢脸
if the men don't spend half their time sniveling over you...and the other half giving you black eyes

2003
02:38:50,861 --> 02:38:53,659
你认为我冷淡 没有感情，自私，是吗？
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?

2004
02:38:53,797 --> 02:38:55,628
去跟你喜欢的人在一起
Of with you to the sort of people you like.

2005
02:38:55,732 --> 02:39:00,465
嫁给感情丰富的贪婪有钱人 用厚嘴唇亲你，用大靴子踢你
Marry a sentimental hog with lots of money...and thick lips to kiss you, and thick boots to kick you.

2006
02:39:00,570 --> 02:39:03,471
如果你无法知足常乐 千万不要乐极生悲
If you can' t appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate.

2007
02:39:03,740 --> 02:39:06,903
我说不赢你 你永远有理由反驳我
I can' t talk to you. You always turn everything against me.

2008
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,568
我永远都是错的
I'm always in the wrong.

2009
02:39:09,146 --> 02:39:13,378
别太有自信 你可以如此践踏和贬低我
Don't be too sure you have me under your feet...to be trampled on and talked down.

2010
02:39:13,483 --> 02:39:16,509
我要嫁给佛雷狄 一旦我有能力养他就会嫁给他
I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as I'm able to support him.

2011
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:18,619
佛雷狄

2012
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:21,084
那可怜的家伙 连跑腿的小事都作不了
That poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy...

2013
02:39:21,191 --> 02:39:23,125
他还敢尝试要娶你？
even if he had the guts to try for it

2014
02:39:23,226 --> 02:39:26,992
女人，你还不明白？ 你已经有资格嫁给国王了
Woman, don't you understand? I have made you a consort for a king!

2015
02:39:27,164 --> 02:39:30,133
佛雷狄爱我 在我心中他就是个国王
Freddy loves me. That makes him king enough for me.

2016
02:39:30,267 --> 02:39:33,202
我不要他去工作 他不像我做惯苦力的事情
I don't want him to work. He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

2017
02:39:33,303 --> 02:39:34,736
我要去当老师
I'll go and be a teacher.

2018
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:37,430
你能教些什么东西？
What 'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2019
02:39:37,541 --> 02:39:40,237
你所教我的，我可以教语言学
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics

2020
02:39:44,448 --> 02:39:48,885
我可以当那个匈牙利人的助手
I'll ofer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungaria

2021
02:39:49,586 --> 02:39:53,352
那个骗子，冒牌货 无知的马屁精？
What, that imposter? That humbug? That toadying ignoramus

2022
02:39:53,657 --> 02:39:55,784
教他我发明的方法？
Teach him my methods, my discoveries

2023
02:39:55,892 --> 02:39:58,486
你再往那个方向做一步 我就拧断你的脖子！
You take one step in that direction, I'll wring your neck!

2024
02:39:58,595 --> 02:40:02,361
拧死我，我在乎什么？ 我早知道有一天你会打我
Wring away! What do I care? I knew you'd strike me one day.

2025
02:40:05,335 --> 02:40:08,270
这个真的整倒你了吧，席根斯
That 's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2026
02:40:08,371 --> 02:40:11,602
我才不管你的霸道 或是你的大话
Now, I don't care for your bullyin' an'your big talk.

2027
02:40:12,743 --> 02:40:14,608
我真的是太傻了
What a fool I was

2028
02:40:14,711 --> 02:40:16,508
真是一个超级大傻瓜
What a dominated fool

2029
02:40:16,613 --> 02:40:19,411
竟以为你是天与地
To think you were the Earth and sky

2030
02:40:20,016 --> 02:40:21,677
我真的是太傻了
What a fool I was

2031
02:40:21,785 --> 02:40:23,582
真是呆头呆脑
What an addle-pated fool

2032
02:40:23,687 --> 02:40:27,851
我真是个大笨蛋
What a mutton-headed dolt was I

2033
02:40:28,024 --> 02:40:36,762
错了，朋友，你不是我的全部
No, my reverberating friend
You are not the beginning and the end

2034
02:40:38,902 --> 02:40:40,699
你这冒失的野丫头！
You impudent hussy!

2035
02:40:40,804 --> 02:40:45,264
你的思想谈吐 都是我赐给你的
There's not an idea in your head or a word in your mouth that I haven't put there.

2036
02:40:46,576 --> 02:40:51,912
没有你春天依旧来
There'll be spring every year Without you

2037
02:40:52,015 --> 02:40:55,678
没有你英国依然在
England still will be here Without you

2038
02:40:55,786 --> 02:40:59,586
树果依然茂盛，海岸仍旧存在
There'll be fruit on the tree And a shore by the sea

2039
02:40:59,689 --> 02:41:03,455
没有你下午茶照常
There'll be crumpets and tea Without you

2040
02:41:03,560 --> 02:41:07,155
没有你艺术与音乐盛况依旧
Art and music will thrive Without you

2041
02:41:07,264 --> 02:41:10,961
没有你济慈作品仍在
Somehow Keats will survive Without you

2042
02:41:11,067 --> 02:41:18,633
没有你西班牙平原照常下雨
And there still will be rain On that plain down in SpainEven that will remain Without you

2043
02:41:18,742 --> 02:41:24,544
没有你我也可活下去
I can do Without you

2044
02:41:25,215 --> 02:41:32,383
我口齿伶俐的朋友
You, dear friend Who talk so well

2045
02:41:32,489 --> 02:41:39,452
你可以去哈特福特，赫里福 和汉普郡
You can go to
Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

2046
02:41:39,563 --> 02:41:43,055
没有你国家依旧运行
They can still rule the land Without you

2047
02:41:43,166 --> 02:41:46,761
没有你温莎堡依旧屹立
Windsor Castle will stand Without you

2048
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:52,672
没有你一切都会顺利
And without much ado We can all muddle throughWithout you!

2049
02:41:52,776 --> 02:41:55,176
你这个厚颜无耻的野丫头！
You brazen hussy!

2050
02:41:55,278 --> 02:41:59,408
没有你潮汐依旧
Without your pulling it The tide comes in

2051
02:41:59,516 --> 02:42:03,452
没有你自转依旧
Without your twirling it The Earth can spin

2052
02:42:03,553 --> 02:42:08,752
没有你浮云依旧
Without your pushing them The clouds roll by

2053
02:42:08,859 --> 02:42:14,354
如果没有你这些依旧 我也可以没有你
If they can do without you, Ducky So can I

2054
02:42:14,464 --> 02:42:17,763
没有你我不孤独
I shall not feel alone Without you

2055
02:42:17,868 --> 02:42:21,463
没有你我可以自立
I can stand on my own Without you

2056
02:42:21,571 --> 02:42:26,031
所以回到你的巢穴里 我只能…
So go back in your shell I can do bloody well...

2057
02:42:26,142 --> 02:42:30,078
老天啊，我真的办到了…
By George, I really did it I did it, I did it

2058
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:32,774
我说我可以改变一个女人 我真的办到了
I said I'd make a woman And indeed I did

2059
02:42:32,883 --> 02:42:35,647
我知道我办得到，我就知道
I knew that I could do it I knew it, I knew it

2060
02:42:35,752 --> 02:42:38,653
我说我可以改变一个女人 我真的成功了
I said I'd make a woman And succeed I did

2061
02:42:38,755 --> 02:42:40,746
伊莱莎，你真的很不可思议
Eliza, you're magnificent

2062
02:42:40,857 --> 02:42:43,382
五分钟前你还是我沉重的负担
Five minutes ago you were a millstone around my neck...

2063
02:42:43,493 --> 02:42:45,484
现在你已充满了活力
and now you're a tower of strength.

2064
02:42:45,595 --> 02:42:47,392
战力的结合
A consort battleship.

2065
02:42:48,598 --> 02:42:50,395
我喜欢你这个样子
I like you this way.

2066
02:42:52,435 --> 02:42:56,269
再见，席根斯教授 你不会再见到我了
Goodbye, Professor Higgins You shall not be seeing me again.

2067
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,978
母亲！
Mother!

2068
02:43:12,389 --> 02:43:13,447
母亲！
Mother!

2069
02:43:14,257 --> 02:43:16,384
怎么了，亨利？发生什么事？
What is it, Henry? What 's happened?

2070
02:43:18,328 --> 02:43:19,488
她走了
She's gone.

2071
02:43:19,596 --> 02:43:21,962
当然，亲爱的 你还在指望什么？
Well, of course, dear. What did you expect

2072
02:43:25,669 --> 02:43:26,795
我该怎么办？
What am I to do?

2073
02:43:26,937 --> 02:43:28,370
你只好过没有她的日子了
Do without, I suppose.

2074
02:43:30,307 --> 02:43:32,070
我会的
And so I shall.

2075
02:43:35,345 --> 02:43:38,337
如果我能让她燃起怒火
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up her little lungs...

2076
02:43:38,448 --> 02:43:41,008
让她找适合她的灭火方式
let her seek some stufiness that suits her.

2077
02:43:42,018 --> 02:43:45,579
她就像猫头鹰一样 讨厌我给的阳光
She's an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine.

2078
02:43:45,889 --> 02:43:47,857
让她走好了，我不需要她
Let her go. I can do without her.

2079
02:43:47,958 --> 02:43:50,256
我并不需要任何人 我有自己的灵魂
I can do without anyone. I have my own soul!

2080
02:43:50,493 --> 02:43:53,326
我自己求爱的欲火！
My own spark of divine fire!

2081
02:43:57,567 --> 02:43:58,898
干得好，伊莱莎
Bravo, Eliza

2082
02:44:19,322 --> 02:44:22,485
该死…
Damn, damn, damn, damn

2083
02:44:24,794 --> 02:44:27,262
我已经习惯她的脸庞了
I've grown accustomed to her face

2084
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,927
她几乎是让一天开始的泉源
She almost makes the day begin

2085
02:44:33,937 --> 02:44:37,202
我习惯她的声调 还有她日夜的口哨声
I've grown accustomed to the tune That she whistles night and noon

2086
02:44:37,407 --> 02:44:41,173
她的微笑，蹙眉 她的得意和失望
Her smiles, her frowns Her ups, her downs

2087
02:44:41,277 --> 02:44:43,268
现在成为我生活的一部分
Are second nature to me now

2088
02:44:44,414 --> 02:44:46,678
像是呼吸般不可或缺
Like breathing out and breathing in

2089
02:44:47,784 --> 02:44:51,652
在我们未见面之前 我是非常独立和满足
I was serenely independent and content Before we met

2090
02:44:51,755 --> 02:44:55,657
我当然可以再回复 那种生活方式
Surely I could always be that way again

2091
02:44:57,060 --> 02:45:01,121
但我已习惯了她的模样
And yet I've grown Accustomed to her looks

2092
02:45:01,431 --> 02:45:03,262
习惯她的声音
Accustomed to her voice

2093
02:45:03,867 --> 02:45:08,531
习惯她的脸庞
Accustomed to her face

2094
02:45:22,385 --> 02:45:24,250
嫁给佛雷狄
Marry Freddy.

2095
02:45:24,454 --> 02:45:29,016
多幼稚的想法，多么没良心 缺德，没大脑的事
What an infantile idea What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do.

2096
02:45:29,125 --> 02:45:32,424
但是她会后悔的…
But she'll regret it She'll regret it

2097
02:45:32,529 --> 02:45:36,192
在还没发誓前 整件事就注定要失败！
It's doomed before they even take the vow!

2098
02:45:36,733 --> 02:45:40,533
我可以想像她当 佛雷狄恩斯福特希尔夫人模样
I can see her now Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill

2099
02:45:40,637 --> 02:45:43,231
在一个悲惨的小店里
In a wretched little flat above a store

2100
02:45:43,706 --> 02:45:46,698
我可以想像她 收银机里没半毛钱
I can see her now, not a penny in the till

2101
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:49,438
而收款员却不停地敲门
And a bill collector beating at the door

2102
02:45:49,946 --> 02:45:55,612
她想当老师 而最后还是去卖花了
She'll try to teach the things I taught herAnd end up selling flowers instead

2103
02:45:55,718 --> 02:45:58,243
当她为生活奋力挣扎时
Begging for her bread and water

2104
02:45:58,354 --> 02:46:01,551
她先生却在床上用早餐
While her husband has His breakfast in bed

2105
02:46:04,561 --> 02:46:09,191
再过几年，她的头发就变白
In a year or so When she's prematurely gray 

2106
02:46:09,299 --> 02:46:12,666
粉嫩的脸颊成死槁
And the blossom in her cheek Has turned to chalk

2107
02:46:12,769 --> 02:46:18,901
她回到家一看，她先生就吓跑 高攀有钱的女人私奔了
She'll come home and lo He'll have upped and run awayWith a social-climbing heiress From New York

2108
02:46:19,175 --> 02:46:20,608
多可怜的伊莱莎
Poor Eliza

2109
02:46:20,710 --> 02:46:22,234
多么地可怕
How simply frightful

2110
02:46:22,345 --> 02:46:24,506
多么地丢人
How humiliating

2111
02:46:24,614 --> 02:46:26,605
多么地令人欣慰
How delightful

2112
02:46:28,952 --> 02:46:31,887
在一个令人心酸的晚上
How poignant it will be On that inevitable night

2113
02:46:31,988 --> 02:46:35,185
她一身破烂又带泪来我家叩门
When she hammers on my door In tears and rags

2114
02:46:35,291 --> 02:46:38,954
悲惨又孤独，忏悔又懊恼
Miserable and lonely Repentant and contrite

2115
02:46:39,062 --> 02:46:41,758
我该收容她？ 还是让她受尽凌辱？
Will I take her in Or hurl her to the wolves?

2116
02:46:41,865 --> 02:46:44,925
亲切地待她？ 还是给她颜色看？
Give her kindness Or the treatment she deserves?

2117
02:46:45,034 --> 02:46:48,936
该让她回来？ 还是将她赶出去？
Will I take her back Or throw the baggage out?

2118
02:46:51,307 --> 02:46:53,537
我是个心胸宽大的人
Well, I'm a most forgiving man

2119
02:46:53,943 --> 02:46:57,310
不会是也不曾是狠心的人
The sort who never could, ever would

2120
02:46:57,413 --> 02:47:01,315
人同此心，心同此理
Take a position and staunchly never budge

2121
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:06,111
我是个心胸宽大的人
A most forgiving man

2122
02:47:08,691 --> 02:47:11,125
但我不该收容她！
But I shall never take her back

2123
02:47:11,861 --> 02:47:13,829
如果她跪在地上
If she were crawling on her knees

2124
02:47:14,597 --> 02:47:17,395
让她哀求 让她受冻，让她呻吟
Let her promise to atone Let her shiver, let her moan

2125
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:21,834
我会把门重重地关上 让这泼妇冻死
I'll slam the door And let the hellcat freeze

2126
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:26,301
嫁给佛雷狄
Marry Freddy.

2127
02:47:40,690 --> 02:47:46,151
但是我已经习惯 每天听她向我说早安
But I'm so used to hear her say "Good morning" every day

2128
02:47:46,262 --> 02:47:48,787
她的欣喜，她的苦恼
Her joys, her woes

2129
02:47:48,898 --> 02:47:51,560
她的兴奋，她的低落
Her highs, her lows

2130
02:47:51,668 --> 02:47:55,069
现在已经成为我生活的一部分
Are second nature to me now

2131
02:47:55,672 --> 02:47:58,505
像是呼吸般不可或缺
Like breathing out and breathing in

2132
02:47:59,742 --> 02:48:04,270
我真的很庆幸是女人 我才能很容易地忘记她
I'm very grateful she's a woman And so easy to forget

2133
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:08,544
不会难以忘怀
Rather like a habit One can always break

2134
02:48:10,820 --> 02:48:15,587
然而我却已习惯了她的身影
And yet I've grown Accustomed to the traceOf something in the air

2135
02:48:15,725 --> 02:48:25,430
然而我已习惯了她在的气息
Accustomed to her face

2136
02:50:01,631 --> 02:50:03,690
哦，都很骄傲
Oh, we are proud.

2137
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:07,201
他不想教人说英语 但是我听到他说过的
He ain't above givin'lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so.

2138
02:50:07,303 --> 02:50:09,464
我不是来此致意的
I ain't come here to ask for any compliment...

2139
02:50:09,572 --> 02:50:12,632
如果我的钱不够我就去别处
and if my money's not good enough, I can go elsewhere.

2140
02:50:12,709 --> 02:50:13,937
够做什么？
Good enough for what?

2141
02:50:14,043 --> 02:50:16,978
足够支付你上课的钱 懂了吗？
Good enough for you. Now you know, don'tcha?

2142
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:20,379
我来这里上课的 并且是付学费，别搞错了
I'm come to 'ave lessons, I am. And to pay for 'em, too...make no mistake.

2143
02:50:20,483 --> 02:50:22,178
你想要干什么，女孩？
What is it you want, my girl?

2144
02:50:22,285 --> 02:50:28,383
我想要在花店当专柜小姐
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop 'stead o' sellin'...at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

2145
02:50:28,491 --> 02:50:31,756
除非我举止优雅 否则他们不会请我
But they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel.

2146
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:33,556
他说他能教我
 He said he could teach me.

2147
02:50:33,663 --> 02:50:35,688
所以我来付钱请他教
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay, not askin' any favor,

2148
02:50:35,798 --> 02:50:39,234
不是要来占便宜的 他却如此对我
 and he treats me as if I was dirt.

2149
02:50:39,335 --> 02:50:43,328
我知道你上课的价钱 所以我准备要付钱
I know what lessons cost as well as you do and I'm ready t'pay.

2150
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:46,573
因此我只会给一先令 随便你要不要
I won't give more than a shillin'. Take it or leave it.

2151
02:50:47,243 --> 02:50:51,407
这真是无法抗拒 她低俗的如此有趣
It's almost irresistible. She's so deliciously low...

2152
02:50:52,014 --> 02:50:54,608
真是脏死了，我接受
so horribly dirty. I'll take it.

2153
02:50:55,318 --> 02:50:57,980
我会让她彻底地改头换面
I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

2154
02:51:00,323 --> 02:51:03,554
我洗了脸洗了手才来的
I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did.

2155
02:51:12,068 --> 02:51:13,660
伊莱莎

2156
02:51:17,707 --> 02:51:19,971
我那该死的拖鞋在哪里？
Where the devil are my slippers

2157
02:52:52,932 --> 02:52:54,923
