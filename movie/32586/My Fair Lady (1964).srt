00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,870
{\fs14}Freddy, go and find a cab.

3
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,670
{\fs14}Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

4
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,100
{\fs14}Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

5
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,770
{\fs14}All right, I'll get one.

6
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,670
{\fs14}Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

7
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,040
{\fs14}I'm so sorry.

8
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,090
{\fs14}Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

9
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,640
{\fs14}-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

10
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,560
{\fs14}He's your son, is he?

11
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,930
{\fs14}If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

12
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,970
{\fs14}...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

13
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,980
{\fs14}Go about your business, my girl.

14
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,860
{\fs14}And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

15
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,030
{\fs14}Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

16
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,740
{\fs14}Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

17
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,330
{\fs14}I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

18
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,790
{\fs14}If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

19
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,670
{\fs14}Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

20
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,170
{\fs14}I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

21
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,880
{\fs14}I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

22
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,460
{\fs14}I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

23
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,760
{\fs14}Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

24
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,230
{\fs14}Thank you, sir.

25
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,520
{\fs14}You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

26
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,570
{\fs14}There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

27
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,500
{\fs14}...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

28
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,670
{\fs14}I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

29
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,510
{\fs14}I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

30
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,750
{\fs14}I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

31
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,430
{\fs14}I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

32
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,050
{\fs14}-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

33
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,970
{\fs14}I'm makin' an honest livin'.

34
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,050
{\fs14}Who's doing all that shouting?

35
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,820
{\fs14}Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

36
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,900
{\fs14}They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

37
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,650
{\fs14}...for speakin' to gentlemen.

38
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,610
{\fs14}There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

39
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,530
{\fs14}On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

40
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,530
{\fs14}Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

41
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,960
{\fs14}Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

42
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,530
{\fs14}You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

43
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,550
{\fs14}That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

44
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,590
{\fs14}I can.

45
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,730
{\fs14}'"l say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl.'"

46
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,520
{\fs14}Oh, it's cause I called him '"Capt'n.'"

47
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,360
{\fs14}I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

48
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,870
{\fs14}I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

49
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,070
{\fs14}...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

50
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,080
{\fs14}...until I ask you.

51
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,540
{\fs14}Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

52
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,710
{\fs14}He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

53
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,790
{\fs14}How are all your people down at Selsey?

54
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,370
{\fs14}Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

55
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,010
{\fs14}Never mind, they do.

56
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,550
{\fs14}How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

57
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,890
{\fs14}What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

58
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,230
{\fs14}It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

59
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,060
{\fs14}Live where you like but stop that noise!

60
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,690
{\fs14}Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

61
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,660
{\fs14}I'm a good girl, I am.

62
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,610
{\fs14}-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

63
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,450
{\fs14}Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

64
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,710
{\fs14}You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

65
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,880
{\fs14}Madam, it's stopped raining.

66
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,450
{\fs14}You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

67
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,290
{\fs14}Isn't that where you live?

68
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,090
{\fs14}What impertinence!

69
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,090
{\fs14}Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

70
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,010
{\fs14}Cheltenham, Harrow...

71
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,020
{\fs14}...Cambridge and...

72
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,150
{\fs14}...lndia?

73
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,430
{\fs14}Quite right.

74
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,110
{\fs14}He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

75
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,030
{\fs14}Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

76
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,240
{\fs14}I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

77
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,660
{\fs14}He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

78
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,460
{\fs14}How do you do it, may I ask?

79
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,420
{\fs14}Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

80
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,970
{\fs14}Anyone can spot an lrishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

81
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,180
{\fs14}...but I can place a man within six miles.

82
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,130
{\fs14}I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

83
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,010
{\fs14}Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

84
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,980
{\fs14}-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

85
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,400
{\fs14}Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

86
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,480
{\fs14}Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

87
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,440
{\fs14}...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

88
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,110
{\fs14}I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

89
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,170
{\fs14}A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

90
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,790
{\fs14}...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

91
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,670
{\fs14}Remember, you're a human with a soul...

92
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,420
{\fs14}...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

93
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,590
{\fs14}Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

94
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,840
{\fs14}...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,290
{\fs14}Listen to them one at a time.

281
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,370
{\fs14}Must l? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

282
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,030
{\fs14}Your name, please?

283
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,020
{\fs14}Your name, miss?

284
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,030
{\fs14}My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

285
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,950
{\fs14}One moment, please.

286
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,580
{\fs14}London is gettin' so dirty these days.

287
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,380
{\fs14}I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

288
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,250
{\fs14}Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

289
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,970
{\fs14}Could you tell me what it's about?

290
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,850
{\fs14}It's business of a personal nature.

291
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,390
{\fs14}One moment, please.

292
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,660
{\fs14}-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

293
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,280
{\fs14}There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

294
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,570
{\fs14}A young woman?

295
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,750
{\fs14}What does she want?

296
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,590
{\fs14}She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

297
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,710
{\fs14}I should've sent her away, only I thought...

298
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,790
{\fs14}...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

299
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,670
{\fs14}-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

300
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,760
{\fs14}Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

301
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,010
{\fs14}This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

302
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,020
{\fs14}We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

303
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,280
{\fs14}...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

304
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,780
{\fs14}...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

305
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,830
{\fs14}This is the young woman, sir.

306
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,190
{\fs14}Good mornin', my good man.

307
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,200
{\fs14}Might I 'ave a word with you?

308
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,780
{\fs14}Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

309
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,130
{\fs14}She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

310
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,130
{\fs14}I won't waste another cylinder on that.

311
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,840
{\fs14}Be off with you. I don't want you.

312
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,100
{\fs14}Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

313
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,060
{\fs14}Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

314
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,180
{\fs14}Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

315
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,430
{\fs14}...what you came in?

316
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,100
{\fs14}Oh, we are proud.

317
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,520
{\fs14}He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

318
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,690
{\fs14}I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

319
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,530
{\fs14}...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

320
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,080
{\fs14}Good enough for what?

321
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,900
{\fs14}Good enough for you.

322
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,870
{\fs14}Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

323
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,500
{\fs14}And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

324
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,620
{\fs14}Well!

325
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,960
{\fs14}And what do you expect me to say?

326
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,260
{\fs14}Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

327
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,050
{\fs14}Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

328
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,760
{\fs14}Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

329
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,260
{\fs14}...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

330
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,400
{\fs14}I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

331
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,400
{\fs14}What do you want, my girl?

332
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,360
{\fs14}I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

333
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,290
{\fs14}...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

334
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,120
{\fs14}But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

335
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,490
{\fs14}He said 'e could teach me.

336
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,660
{\fs14}Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

337
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,000
{\fs14}Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

338
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,540
{\fs14}I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

339
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,840
{\fs14}How much?

340
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,020
{\fs14}Now you're talkin'.

341
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,770
{\fs14}I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

342
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,980
{\fs14}...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

343
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,770
{\fs14}You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

344
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,060
{\fs14}Sit down.

345
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,400
{\fs14}-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

346
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,570
{\fs14}Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

347
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,490
{\fs14}What's your name?

348
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,530
{\fs14}Eliza Doolittle.

349
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,660
{\fs14}Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

350
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,130
{\fs14}I don't mind if I do.

351
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,800
{\fs14}How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

352
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,510
{\fs14}Oh, I know what's right.

353
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,470
{\fs14}My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

354
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,470
{\fs14}...from a real French gentleman.

355
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,890
{\fs14}You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

356
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,820
{\fs14}...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

357
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,270
{\fs14}I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

358
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,490
{\fs14}Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

359
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,830
{\fs14}...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

360
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,870
{\fs14}...it works out as fully equivalent of...

361
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,040
{\fs14}...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

362
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,300
{\fs14}By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

363
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,600
{\fs14}Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

364
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,060
{\fs14}-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

365
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,770
{\fs14}But I ain't got 60 pounds!

366
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,640
{\fs14}Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

367
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,070
{\fs14}Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

368
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,320
{\fs14}Sit down!

369
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,820
{\fs14}Anybody'd think you was my father!

370
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,570
{\fs14}If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

371
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,370
{\fs14}Here.

372
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,700
{\fs14}What's this for?

373
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,580
{\fs14}To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

374
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,640
{\fs14}Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

375
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,300
{\fs14}Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

376
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,220
{\fs14}It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

377
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,930
{\fs14}Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

378
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,100
{\fs14}Higgins, I'm interested.

379
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,560
{\fs14}What about your boast...

380
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,520
{\fs14}...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

381
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,450
{\fs14}I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

382
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,660
{\fs14}I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

383
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,580
{\fs14}I'll even pay for the lessons.

384
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,370
{\fs14}You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

385
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,750
{\fs14}It's almost irresistible.

386
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,760
{\fs14}She's so deliciously low.

387
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,390
{\fs14}So horribly dirty.

388
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,050
{\fs14}I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

389
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,090
{\fs14}I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

390
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,020
{\fs14}We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

391
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,530
{\fs14}Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

392
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,650
{\fs14}Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

393
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,360
{\fs14}Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

394
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,450
{\fs14}You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

395
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,040
{\fs14}I'm a good girl, I am.

396
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,910
{\fs14}And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

397
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,790
{\fs14}We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

398
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,290
{\fs14}You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

399
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,840
{\fs14}Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

400
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,760
{\fs14}I'll call the police, I will.

401
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,480
{\fs14}I've got no place to put her.

402
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,520
{\fs14}Well, put her in the dustbin.

403
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,470
{\fs14}Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

404
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,140
{\fs14}You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

405
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,730
{\fs14}You can't walk over everybody like this.

406
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,520
{\fs14}I?

407
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,120
{\fs14}Walk over everybody?

408
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,370
{\fs14}My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

409
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,630
{\fs14}I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

410
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,300
{\fs14}I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

411
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,830
{\fs14}...or yours.

412
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,010
{\fs14}But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

413
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,800
{\fs14}...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

414
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,060
{\fs14}Why not?

415
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,020
{\fs14}Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

416
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,890
{\fs14}What about her parents?
She may be married.

417
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,350
{\fs14}Garn!

418
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,780
{\fs14}There. As the girl
very properly says, '"garn! '"

419
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,230
{\fs14}Who'd marry me?

420
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,450
{\fs14}By George, Eliza...

421
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,660
{\fs14}...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

422
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,420
{\fs14}...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

423
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,210
{\fs14}I'm goin'.

424
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,050
{\fs14}He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

425
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,310
{\fs14}Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

426
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,600
{\fs14}-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.

427
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,180
{\fs14}Go home to your parents, girl.

428
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,020
{\fs14}I ain't got no parents.

429
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,140
{\fs14}She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

430
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,650
{\fs14}Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

431
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,190
{\fs14}What's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?

432
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,860
{\fs14}Do be sensible, sir.

433
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,650
{\fs14}What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

434
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,320
{\fs14}She'll drink if you give her money.

435
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,160
{\fs14}You are a brute! It's a lie!

436
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,740
{\fs14}Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

437
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,920
{\fs14}Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

438
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:11,210
{\fs14}Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

439
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,420
{\fs14}No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

440
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,720
{\fs14}Well, have you, Eliza?

441
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,130
{\fs14}I got me feelings same as anyone else.

442
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,510
{\fs14}Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

443
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,010
{\fs14}What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

444
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,930
{\fs14}You must look ahead a little, sir.

445
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,280
{\fs14}What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

446
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,690
{\fs14}That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

447
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,320
{\fs14}When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

448
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,740
{\fs14}Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

449
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,150
{\fs14}You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

450
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,160
{\fs14}You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

451
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,580
{\fs14}I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

452
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,710
{\fs14}You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

453
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,710
{\fs14}Have some chocolates, Eliza.

454
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,180
{\fs14}'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

455
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,390
{\fs14}I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

456
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,350
{\fs14}Pledge of good faith.

457
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,570
{\fs14}I'll take one half.

458
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,150
{\fs14}And you take the other.

459
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,700
{\fs14}You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

460
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,790
{\fs14}You'll live on them, eh?

461
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,780
{\fs14}I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

462
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,380
{\fs14}Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

463
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,090
{\fs14}...and gold and diamonds.

464
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,220
{\fs14}I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

465
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,880
{\fs14}Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

466
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,980
{\fs14}If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

467
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,610
{\fs14}...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

468
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,860
{\fs14}You are to stay here
for the next six months...

469
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,950
{\fs14}...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

470
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,870
{\fs14}If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

471
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,260
{\fs14}...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

472
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,800
{\fs14}But if you are naughty and idle...

473
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,720
{\fs14}...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

474
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,840
{\fs14}...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

475
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,020
{\fs14}At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

476
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,770
{\fs14}...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

477
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,940
{\fs14}If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

478
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,360
{\fs14}...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

479
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,450
{\fs14}...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

480
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,910
{\fs14}But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

481
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,210
{\fs14}...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

482
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,470
{\fs14}If you refuse this offer...

483
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,500
{\fs14}...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

484
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,550
{\fs14}...and the angels will weep for you!

485
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,030
{\fs14}Are you satisfied, Pickering?

486
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,190
{\fs14}I don't understand
what you're talking about.

487
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,740
{\fs14}Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

488
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,740
{\fs14}Come with me.

489
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,580
{\fs14}That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

490
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,570
{\fs14}You're a great bully, you are!

491
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,910
{\fs14}I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

492
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,710
{\fs14}Don't answer back, girl.

493
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,660
{\fs14}I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

494
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,090
{\fs14}In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

495
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,930
{\fs14}...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

496
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,680
{\fs14}I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

497
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,100
{\fs14}I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

498
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,860
{\fs14}You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

499
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,740
{\fs14}I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

500
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,780
{\fs14}I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

501
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
{\fs14}It's too good for the likes o' me.

502
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,080
{\fs14}I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

503
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,250
{\fs14}I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

504
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,260
{\fs14}What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

505
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,400
{\fs14}This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

506
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,190
{\fs14}You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

507
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,400
{\fs14}Not me!

508
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,700
{\fs14}I shall catch me death.

509
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,490
{\fs14}Come along now.

510
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,250
{\fs14}Come along.

511
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,420
{\fs14}Take your clothes off.

512
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,390
{\fs14}Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

513
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,840
{\fs14}Here, come on. Help me take these--

514
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
{\fs14}Take your hands off me!

515
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,420
{\fs14}I'm a good girl, I am!

516
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,800
{\fs14}It ain't right! It ain't decent!

517
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,810
{\fs14}Get your hands off me!

518
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,610
{\fs14}I'm a good girl, I am!

519
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,340
{\fs14}Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

520
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,340
{\fs14}...l shall feel responsible for the girl.

521
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,380
{\fs14}I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

522
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,140
{\fs14}What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

523
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,230
{\fs14}Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

524
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,770
{\fs14}Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

525
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,060
{\fs14}Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

526
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,150
{\fs14}Yes, very frequently.

527
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,660
{\fs14}I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

528
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,030
{\fs14}...she becomes jealous, exacting...

529
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,370
{\fs14}...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

530
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,750
{\fs14}The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

531
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,420
{\fs14}So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

532
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,670
{\fs14}Well, after all, Pickering....

533
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,890
{\fs14}'"l'm an ordinary man

534
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,340
{\fs14}'"Who desires nothing more

535
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,520
{\fs14}'"Than just an ordinary chance

536
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,980
{\fs14}'"To live exactly as he likes

537
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,220
{\fs14}'"And do precisely what he wants

538
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
{\fs14}'"An average man, am I

539
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,690
{\fs14}'"Of no eccentric whim

540
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,820
{\fs14}'"Who likes to live his life

541
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,150
{\fs14}'"Free of strife

542
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,030
{\fs14}'"Doing whatever he thinks is best for him

543
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,530
{\fs14}'"Oh, just an ordinary man

544
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,540
{\fs14}'"But let a woman in your life

545
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,210
{\fs14}'"And your serenity is through

546
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,970
{\fs14}'"She'll redecorate your home
From the cellar to the dome

547
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,550
{\fs14}'"Then go on to the enthralling fun
of overhauling you!

548
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,260
{\fs14}'"Let a woman in your life

549
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,930
{\fs14}'"And you are up against a wall

550
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,690
{\fs14}'"Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind

551
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,530
{\fs14}'"So rather than do either
You do something else that neither

{\fs14}'"Likes at all!

553

00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,240
{\fs14}'"She only wants to talk of love

555
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,040

00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,730
{\fs14}'"With a little bit

699
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,480
{\fs14}'"With a little bit

700
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,730
{\fs14}'"With a little bit o' luck
She won't find out!

701
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,580
{\fs14}'"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck! '"

702
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,100
{\fs14}The mail, sir.

703
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,110
{\fs14}Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

704
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,900
{\fs14}You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

705
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,280
{\fs14}Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

706
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:45,120
{\fs14}...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

707
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,860
{\fs14}You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

708
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,540
{\fs14}When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

709
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:55,130
{\fs14}There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

710
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,420
{\fs14}He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

711
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,590
{\fs14}Throw it away.

712
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,180
{\fs14}It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

713
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,180
{\fs14}All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

714
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,400
{\fs14}If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

715
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,530
{\fs14}...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

716
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,860
{\fs14}I say!

717
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,030
{\fs14}Well, send the blackguard up.

718
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,120
{\fs14}He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

719
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,870
{\fs14}Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

720
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,330
{\fs14}I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

721
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,920
{\fs14}No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

722
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,590
{\fs14}Doolittle, sir.

723
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,100
{\fs14}-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

724
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,300
{\fs14}Where?

725
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,730
{\fs14}Good morning, Governor.

726
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,190
{\fs14}I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

727
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,740
{\fs14}Brought up in Houndslow.

728
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,370
{\fs14}Mother Welsh, I should think.

729
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,950
{\fs14}What is it you want, Doolittle?

730
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,580
{\fs14}I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

731
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,160
{\fs14}Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

732
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,880
{\fs14}I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

733
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,590
{\fs14}She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

734
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,790
{\fs14}What?

735
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:20,300
{\fs14}Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

736
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,190
{\fs14}Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

737
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,390
{\fs14}Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

738
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,820
{\fs14}The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

739
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,950
{\fs14}How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

740
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,490
{\fs14}You sent her here on purpose!

741
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,910
{\fs14}Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

742
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,240
{\fs14}The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

743
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,710
{\fs14}...a plot to extort money by threats.

744
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,750
{\fs14}I shall telephone the police.

745
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,880
{\fs14}Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

746
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,970
{\fs14}I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

747
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,210
{\fs14}Well, what else did you come for?

748
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,090
{\fs14}What would a bloke come for?

749
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,390
{\fs14}Be 'uman, Governor.

750
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,440
{\fs14}Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

751
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,230
{\fs14}So help me, Governor, I never did.

752
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,740
{\fs14}How did you know she was here?

753
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,700
{\fs14}I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

754
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,660
{\fs14}I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

755
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,710
{\fs14}I'm waiting to tell ya!

756
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,470
{\fs14}You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

757
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,590
{\fs14}Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

758
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,800
{\fs14}'"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.'"

759
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,050
{\fs14}That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

760
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,930
{\fs14}How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

761
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,520
{\fs14}Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

762
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,320
{\fs14}She said she didn't want no clothes.

763
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,610
{\fs14}What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

764
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,830
{\fs14}So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

765
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,660
{\fs14}-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

766
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,450
{\fs14}Mrs. Pearce!

767
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,330
{\fs14}Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

768
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,840
{\fs14}Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

769
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,470
{\fs14}You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

770
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,060
{\fs14}Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

771
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,850
{\fs14}I think so indeed, sir!

772
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,550
{\fs14}Here, Governor.

773
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,900
{\fs14}I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

774
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,610
{\fs14}...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

775
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,620
{\fs14}...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

776
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,450
{\fs14}All I ask is my rights as a father.

777
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,210
{\fs14}You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

778
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,800
{\fs14}I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

779
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,920
{\fs14}So...

780
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,960
{\fs14}...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

781
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,310
{\fs14}I think you should know, Doolittle...

782
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,560
{\fs14}...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

783
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,770
{\fs14}Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

784
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,110
{\fs14}You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

785
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,940
{\fs14}Have you no morals, man?

786
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,030
{\fs14}No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

787
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,330
{\fs14}Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

788
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,920
{\fs14}...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

789
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,290
{\fs14}Why not?

790
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,710
{\fs14}Look at it my way. What am l?

791
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,800
{\fs14}I ask ya, what am l? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

792
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,930
{\fs14}Think what that means to a man.

793
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,720
{\fs14}It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

794
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,270
{\fs14}If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

795
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,980
{\fs14}'"You're undeservin', so you can't have it.'"

796
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,160
{\fs14}But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

797
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,740
{\fs14}...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

798
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,330
{\fs14}I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

799
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,800
{\fs14}I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

800
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:00,840
{\fs14}...a lot more.

801
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,130
{\fs14}I'm playin' straight with you.

802
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,920
{\fs14}I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

803
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,480
{\fs14}...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

804
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,150
{\fs14}But will you take advantage of...

805
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:14,950
{\fs14}a man's nature...

806
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,900
{\fs14}...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

807
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,700
{\fs14}...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

808
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,080
{\fs14}...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

809
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:32,340
{\fs14}Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

810
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,340
{\fs14}And I leave it to you.

811
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,770
{\fs14}You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

812
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:45,270
{\fs14}...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

813
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,440
{\fs14}-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

814
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,570
{\fs14}Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

815
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,150
{\fs14}Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

816
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,330
{\fs14}...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

817
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,280
{\fs14}An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

818
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,040
{\fs14}You couldn't spend it better.

819
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,880
{\fs14}This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

820
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,460
{\fs14}The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

821
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,260
{\fs14}Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

822
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,880
{\fs14}Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

823
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:17,350
{\fs14}No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

824
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,770
{\fs14}I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

825
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,930
{\fs14}Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

826
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:26,440
{\fs14}After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

827
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,150
{\fs14}Who told you that, Governor?

828
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,070
{\fs14}Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

829
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,530
{\fs14}If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

830
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,460
{\fs14}-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

831
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,920
{\fs14}Are you sure you won't have ten?

832
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:45,290
{\fs14}No. No, perhaps another time.

so good-looking.

838
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,690
{\fs14}What are you doin' here?

839

give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

{\fs14}Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

843
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:21,870
{\fs14}There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

844
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,710
{\fs14}Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

845
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,140
{\fs14}...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

846
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,010
{\fs14}...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

{\fs14}What did he come for?

848
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:36,390
{\fs14}Say your vowels.

849
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,520
{\fs14}I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

850
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,890
{\fs14}If you know them, say them.

851

{\fs14}Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

{\fs14}A, E, l, O, U.

853
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,700
{\fs14}That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

but try to understand.

856
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,120
{\fs14}There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

{\fs14}Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

859
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,380
{\fs14}Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

{\fs14}Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.

{\fs14}Do you know what it might have been?

Did you, Pickering?

01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:23,000
{\fs14}No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1069
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,950
{\fs14}First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

{\fs14}Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1071
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,800
{\fs14}But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

{\fs14}Hello, Mother.

1155
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:52,510
{\fs14}How nice you look.

1156
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,970
{\fs14}What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

1157
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,560
{\fs14}I can't. I'm here on business.

1158
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,480
{\fs14}You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

1159
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:03,020
{\fs14}The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

1160
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:04,900
{\fs14}Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

1161
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:07,520
{\fs14}I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

1162
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,110
{\fs14}A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1163
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,030
{\fs14}Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1164
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,570
{\fs14}I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

1165
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:19,750
{\fs14}-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1166
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:23,160
{\fs14}So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1167
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,710
{\fs14}Common flower girl?

1168
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,840
{\fs14}I taught her how to speak properly.

1169
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,210
{\fs14}She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1170
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,720
{\fs14}She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

1171
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,970
{\fs14}'"Fine day! '" and '"How do you do?'"
Not let herself go on.

1172
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,100
{\fs14}Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

1173
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,390
{\fs14}Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1174
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,520
{\fs14}She's got to talk about something.

1175
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:43,800
{\fs14}Where is the girl now?

1176
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:47,180
{\fs14}She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

1177
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,190
{\fs14}I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

1178
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:56,070
{\fs14}-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1179
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,780
{\fs14}You know my son, Henry.

1180
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:00,120
{\fs14}How do you do?

1181
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:03,080
{\fs14}-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.

1182
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,660
{\fs14}It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

1183
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:11,120
{\fs14}Where the devil can they be?

1184
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,290
{\fs14}Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1185
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,660
{\fs14}Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1186
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,080
{\fs14}My dear Miss Doolittle.

1187
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,880
{\fs14}How kind of you to let me come.

1188
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,460
{\fs14}Delighted, my dear.

1189
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,420
{\fs14}-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?

1190
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,390
{\fs14}-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?

1191
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:05,390
{\fs14}How do you do?

1192
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,390
{\fs14}-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?

1193
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,970
{\fs14}How do you do?

1194
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:12,100
{\fs14}And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1195
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,810
{\fs14}How do you do?

1196
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,730
{\fs14}How do you do?

1197
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:20,770
{\fs14}Miss Doolittle.

1198
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:24,200
{\fs14}Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1199
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,120
{\fs14}The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1200
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:38,450
{\fs14}I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1201
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,500
{\fs14}Will it rain, do you think?

1202
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,880
{\fs14}'"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain.'"

1203
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:54,510
{\fs14}'"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.'"

1204
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,350
{\fs14}How awfully funny.

1205
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,970
{\fs14}What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1206
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,350
{\fs14}Smashing.

1207
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,110
{\fs14}Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1208
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:08,980
{\fs14}I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1209
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,230
{\fs14}They bring on so much influenza.

1210
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:14,080
{\fs14}And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

1211
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,490
{\fs14}My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1212
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,830
{\fs14}But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

1213
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,330
{\fs14}Done her in?

1214
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,670
{\fs14}Yes, Lord love you.

1215
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:30,170
{\fs14}Why should she die of influenza...

1216
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:34,210
{\fs14}...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

1217
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:36,680
{\fs14}Fairly blue with it she was.

1218
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:39,220
{\fs14}They all thought she was dead.

1219
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:43,440
{\fs14}But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1220
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,780
{\fs14}Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1221
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,530
{\fs14}Dear me!

1222
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:00,040
{\fs14}Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

1223
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,030
{\fs14}...have to die of influenza?

1224
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:07,040
{\fs14}And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1225
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:11,960
{\fs14}Somebody pinched it.

1226
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,010
{\fs14}And what I say is:

1227
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:18,170
{\fs14}Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1228
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,970
{\fs14}Done her in? '"Done her in,'" did you say?

1229
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,340
{\fs14}Whatever does it mean?

1230
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,060
{\fs14}That's the new small talk.
'"To do somebody in'" means to kill them.

1231
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:32,820
{\fs14}But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1232
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,680
{\fs14}Do I not?

1233
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:39,810
{\fs14}Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1234
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,650
{\fs14}But it can't have been right
for your father...

1235
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:45,580
{\fs14}...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1236
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,620
{\fs14}It might have killed her.

1237
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:51,490
{\fs14}Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1238
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:57,000
{\fs14}Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

1239
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,500
{\fs14}Do you mean that he drank?

1240
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:02,430
{\fs14}Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1241
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,350
{\fs14}Here, what are you sniggering at?

1242
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,140
{\fs14}The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

1243
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,020
{\fs14}Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1244
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,270
{\fs14}Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1245
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,780
{\fs14}Not at all, my dear.

1246
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,950
{\fs14}Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1247
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:32,490
{\fs14}I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

1248
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,410
{\fs14}...but come, my dear.

1249
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:38,460
{\fs14}I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

1250
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,670
{\fs14}You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1251
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,380
{\fs14}That's very kind of you.

1252
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,580
{\fs14}His name is Dover.

1253
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,130
{\fs14}Come along.

1254
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,510
{\fs14}'"There they are again

01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,770
{\fs14}'"They are ready for it. Look!

1258
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:00,060
{\fs14}'"lt has begun'"

1259
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,780
{\fs14}Come on. Come on, Dover.

1260
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,740
{\fs14}Come on.

1261
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,660
{\fs14}Come on, Dover!

1262
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:12,820
{\fs14}Come on!

1263
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:21,330
{\fs14}Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

1264
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,220
{\fs14}Oh, my dear.

1265
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:48,060
{\fs14}You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1266
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:49,690
{\fs14}Don't you think she's ready for it?

1267
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,150
{\fs14}Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1268
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,480
{\fs14}Her language may need
a little refining, but--

1269
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:58,190
{\fs14}Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

1270
01:31:58,290 --> 01:31:59,950
{\fs14}...then you must be potty about her.

1271
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,110
{\fs14}I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

1272
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,780
{\fs14}...or this poor girl through any more.

1273
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,410
{\fs14}It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

1274
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,950
{\fs14}Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1275
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:13,910
{\fs14}Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1276
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:18,630
{\fs14}You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1277
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,000
{\fs14}Here's the car.

1278
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:42,250
{\fs14}Good evening, sir.

1279
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:45,010
{\fs14}-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.

1280
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,170
{\fs14}Good evening, Professor Higgins.

1281
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:08,990
{\fs14}'"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon

1282
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,030
{\fs14}'"She completely done me in

1283
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:16,910
{\fs14}'"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon

1284
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:22,130
{\fs14}'"When she told about her father
and the gin

1285
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,790
{\fs14}'"And I never saw a more enchanting farce

1286
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:32,470
{\fs14}'"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--''"

1287
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,220
{\fs14}-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?

1288
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,130
{\fs14}Whom shall I say is calling?

1289
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:40,510
{\fs14}Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

1290
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:43,560
{\fs14}...tell her I'm the chap
who was '"sniggering'" at her.

1291
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:44,640
{\fs14}Yes, sir.

1292
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:46,640
{\fs14}And will you give her these?

1293
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,310
{\fs14}Wouldn't you like to come in?

1294
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,530
{\fs14}They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

1295
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:54,150
{\fs14}No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

1296
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:07,460
{\fs14}'"l have often walked
down this street before

1297
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:13,170
{\fs14}'"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before

1298
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:18,880
{\fs14}'"All at once am I several stories high

1299
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,180
{\fs14}'"Knowing I'm on the street where you live

1300
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,440
{\fs14}'"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?

1301
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:36,110
{\fs14}'"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?

1302
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:41,860
{\fs14}'"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?

1303
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:47,320
{\fs14}'"No, it's just on the street where you live

1304
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,370
{\fs14}'"And, oh, the towering feeling

1305
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:58,710
{\fs14}'"Just to know somehow you are near

1306
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:04,970
{\fs14}'"The overpowering feeling

1307
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,180
{\fs14}'"That any second you may suddenly appear

1308
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:16,520
{\fs14}'"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

1309
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:22,190
{\fs14}'"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

1310
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:26,490
{\fs14}'"Let the time go by

1311
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:30,620
{\fs14}'"l won't care if I

1312
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:36,030
{\fs14}'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

1313
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,290
{\fs14}I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1314
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:48,550
{\fs14}Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

1315
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,350
{\fs14}But why? She was unbelievable.

1316
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:53,600
{\fs14}So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

1317
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,010
{\fs14}Tell her that I'll wait.

1318
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,510
{\fs14}But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

1319
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:01,140
{\fs14}But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1320
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,740
{\fs14}'"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

1321
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:20,740
{\fs14}'"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

1322
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,790

1324
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:35,420
{\fs14}'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

1325
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:48,230
{\fs14}It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1326
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,360
{\fs14}Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

1327
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:54,400
{\fs14}You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

1328
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:57,200
{\fs14}...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

1329
01:37:57,290 --> 01:38:00,820
{\fs14}Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1330
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:03,160
{\fs14}I know you're a stubborn man, but so am l.

1331
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,160
{\fs14}This experiment is over.

1332
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:09,580
{\fs14}And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

1333
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,960
{\fs14}You understand, Higgins? It's over.

1334
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,510
{\fs14}Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

1335
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,220
{\fs14}...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

1336
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,550
{\fs14}...it'll be on your head alone.

1337
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,890
{\fs14}Eliza can do anything.

1338
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,770
{\fs14}Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1339
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:27,730
{\fs14}Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1340
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:30,480
{\fs14}There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1341
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:34,820
{\fs14}Think of how agonizing it would be.

1342
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,570
{\fs14}If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1343
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,230
{\fs14}You could always rejoin your regiment.

1344
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,150
{\fs14}This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1345
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,280
{\fs14}The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

1346
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,450
{\fs14}...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

1347
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:48,540
{\fs14}For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

1348
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,580
{\fs14}Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

1349
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,000
{\fs14}I'm not nervous.

1350
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:55,540
{\fs14}-Where is it?
-On the piano.

1351
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:58,420
{\fs14}The car's here, sir.

1352
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,170
{\fs14}Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

1353
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,880
{\fs14}Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1354
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,050
{\fs14}I warned you about these French designers.

1355
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:09,470
{\fs14}We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

1356
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,890
{\fs14}-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

1357
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:22,450
{\fs14}Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1358
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,690
{\fs14}Well, we shall see.

1359
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:26,580
{\fs14}Suppose she doesn't?

1360
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:29,370
{\fs14}I lose my bet.

1361
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:33,200
{\fs14}There's one thing I can't stand about you,
your confounded complacency.

1362
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:35,330
{\fs14}At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

1363
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:38,920
{\fs14}...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1364
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:44,340
{\fs14}And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1365
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,050
{\fs14}Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1366
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:49,840
{\fs14}What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

1367
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:53,430
{\fs14}What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

1368
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,730
{\fs14}...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

1369
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:01,560
{\fs14}It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

1370
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:03,310
{\fs14}...and soul from soul.

1371
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:06,410
{\fs14}Oh, she matters immensely.

1372
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:31,000
{\fs14}Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1373
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:33,260
{\fs14}Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1374
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:35,260
{\fs14}Don't you think so, Higgins?

1375
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:40,650
{\fs14}Not bad. Not bad at all.

1376
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,770
{\fs14}Maestro! Maestro!

1377
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:15,190
{\fs14}Don't you remember me?

1378
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,900
{\fs14}No. Who the devil are you?

1379
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:20,440
{\fs14}I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1380
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:23,060
{\fs14}I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1381
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,200
{\fs14}I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

1382
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:28,200
{\fs14}You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

1383
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:30,030
{\fs14}Why don't you have your hair cut?

1384
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,660
{\fs14}I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

1385
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:35,830
{\fs14}If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1386
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,750
{\fs14}Where did you get these old coins?

1387
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,830
{\fs14}These are decorations for languages.

1388
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,670
{\fs14}The Queen of Transylvania is here.

1389
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,880
{\fs14}I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1390
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,890
{\fs14}I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

1391
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:50,050
{\fs14}No imposter can escape my detection.

1392
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:52,130
{\fs14}Professor Karpathy.

1393
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:55,850
{\fs14}The Greek ambassador.

1394
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:57,730
{\fs14}Greek, my foot!

1395
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,600
{\fs14}He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

1396
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:03,100
{\fs14}He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1397
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:07,240
{\fs14}He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

1398
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,570
{\fs14}...without betraying his origin.

1399
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:13,410
{\fs14}I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

1400
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:16,780
{\fs14}Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

1401
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,510
{\fs14}Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1402
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,770
{\fs14}Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1403
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:49,320
{\fs14}Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

1404
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:11,330
{\fs14}The Count and Countess Demereau.

1405
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:14,540
{\fs14}The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

1406
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:17,590
{\fs14}Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1407
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,840
{\fs14}Lord and Lady Clanders.

1408
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,390
{\fs14}Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

1409
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:28,310
{\fs14}Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.

1410
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:30,730
{\fs14}Professor Higgins.

1411
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,310
{\fs14}-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle.

1412
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,680
{\fs14}How do you do?

1413
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:37,070
{\fs14}-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.

1414
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:41,830
{\fs14}What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.

1415
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:43,320
{\fs14}Well, who is she?

1416
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,410
{\fs14}Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1417
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,080
{\fs14}Professor Higgins.

1418
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:53,250
{\fs14}Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1419
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:55,750
{\fs14}So she has. A sort of garden.

1420
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:28,070
{\fs14}Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

1421
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,330
{\fs14}-Sort of, you know, '"imposterologist.'"
-I beg you pardon?

1422
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,620
{\fs14}The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

1423
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,330
{\fs14}Find out who she is.

1424
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:37,830
{\fs14}With pleasure.

1425
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,790
{\fs14}The whole situation is highly explosive.

1426
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,170
{\fs14}Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

1427
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:52,850
{\fs14}Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1428
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,140
{\fs14}Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1429
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:06,820
{\fs14}Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

1430
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:10,280
{\fs14}...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1431
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,860
{\fs14}Charming. Quite charming.

1432
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,000
{\fs14}Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1433
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:41,130
{\fs14}Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

1434
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:37,930
{\fs14}Eliza.

1435
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,070
{\fs14}Absolutely fantastic.

1436
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:55,000
{\fs14}A lot of tomfoolery.

1437
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,120
{\fs14}It was an immense achievement.

1438
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,670
{\fs14}Well, Mr. Higgins?

1439
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:02,250
{\fs14}A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

1440
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:06,000
{\fs14}Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

1441
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:10,170
{\fs14}Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

1442
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:12,050
{\fs14}Not during the whole evening?

1443
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,800
{\fs14}Not when I saw we were going to win.

1444
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:15,890
{\fs14}I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

1445
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,640
{\fs14}It was an immense achievement.

1446
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:20,810
{\fs14}If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

1447
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,230
{\fs14}Absolutely fantastic.

1448
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,860
{\fs14}Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1449
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,900
{\fs14}Higgins, I salute you.

1450
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:28,740
{\fs14}The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1451
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:31,830
{\fs14}'"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

I doubted you'd do it

{\fs14}'"But now I must admit it
That succeed you did

1455

{\fs14}'"You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight

{\fs14}'"All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight

Give credit where it's due

{\fs14}'"But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it

{\fs14}'"As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter

1463

a lady before

Asked to meet her

{\fs14}Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1478
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:04,070
{\fs14}If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.

1479
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,400
{\fs14}Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1480
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,580
{\fs14}Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks.

{\fs14}'"That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech

{\fs14}Why did you throw the slippers at me?

1534
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:57,340
{\fs14}Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1535
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:59,590
{\fs14}Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

1536
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:03,470
{\fs14}You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

1537
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:06,140
{\fs14}Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1538
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,980
{\fs14}Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

1539
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:13,650
{\fs14}Sit down and be quiet!

1540
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:16,360
{\fs14}What's to become of me?

1541
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:21,450
{\fs14}How do I know what's to become of you?

1542
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:22,740
{\fs14}What does it matter?

1543
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:25,500
{\fs14}You don't care. I know you don't care.

1544
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:28,080
{\fs14}You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

1545
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:30,040
{\fs14}Not as much as them slippers.

1546
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:31,210
{\fs14}Those slippers!

1547
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,960
{\fs14}Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

1548
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,310
{\fs14}Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1549
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:44,310
{\fs14}May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1550
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:45,220
{\fs14}No.

1551
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:48,470
{\fs14}Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1552
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:49,600
{\fs14}No.

1553
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:52,980
{\fs14}Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1554
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:54,810
{\fs14}No.

1555
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,810
{\fs14}Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1556
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:00,690
{\fs14}Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1557
02:00:01,370 --> 02:00:03,740
{\fs14}Would you have a chocolate?

1558
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,570
{\fs14}No, thank you.

1559
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:12,750
{\fs14}Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

1560
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,710
{\fs14}Nothing more to worry about.

1561
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,670
{\fs14}No, nothing more for you to worry about.

1562
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:21,710
{\fs14}Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1563
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:24,920
{\fs14}Why? ln heaven's name, why?

1564
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:29,510
{\fs14}Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1565
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:32,140
{\fs14}I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1566
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:35,730
{\fs14}It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

1567
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:37,020
{\fs14}Go to bed and sleep it off.

1568
02:00:37,110 --> 02:00:41,570
{\fs14}Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1569
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:43,730
{\fs14}I heard your prayers.

1570
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:45,650
{\fs14}'"Thank God it's all over.'"

1571
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,490
{\fs14}Don't you thank God it's all over?

1572
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:49,990
{\fs14}Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

1573
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:53,200
{\fs14}Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1574
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:56,670
{\fs14}Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1575
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,370
{\fs14}And what's to become of me?

1576
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:03,300
{\fs14}That's what's worrying you, is it?

1577
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,880
{\fs14}I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1578
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:11,380
{\fs14}I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1579
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:16,770
{\fs14}I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1580
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:19,770
{\fs14}You might marry, you know.

1581
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:24,060
{\fs14}You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1582
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:27,150
{\fs14}Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1583
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:28,900
{\fs14}You're not bad-looking.

1584
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,480
{\fs14}You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1585
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,120
{\fs14}Not now, when you've been crying.

1586
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:35,000
{\fs14}You look like the very devil, but...

1587
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:39,540
{\fs14}...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

1588
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,790
{\fs14}Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

1589
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:47,660
{\fs14}...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

1590
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:55,970
{\fs14}I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

1591
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:58,180
{\fs14}We were above that at Covent Garden.

1592
02:01:58,270 --> 02:01:59,730
{\fs14}What do you mean?

1593
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:02,470
{\fs14}I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1594
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:06,350
{\fs14}Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1595
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:09,110
{\fs14}Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

1596
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:12,230
{\fs14}...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

1597
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,400
{\fs14}Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1598
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:16,120
{\fs14}What else am I to do?

1599
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,030
{\fs14}Oh, there are lots of things.

1600
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,530
{\fs14}What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1601
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:23,660
{\fs14}I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1602
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:25,710
{\fs14}He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1603
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:29,870
{\fs14}And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1604
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:32,460
{\fs14}Come on now. You'll be all right.

1605
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:36,800
{\fs14}Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1606
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:40,430
{\fs14}I was looking for something. What was it?

1607
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,710
{\fs14}Your slippers.

1608
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:44,980
{\fs14}Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1609
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,390
{\fs14}Before you go, sir.

1610
02:02:52,150 --> 02:02:55,150
{\fs14}Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1611
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,450
{\fs14}What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

1612
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:00,530
{\fs14}Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

1613
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:02,080
{\fs14}What may I take away with me?

1614
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,570
{\fs14}I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1615
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:06,330
{\fs14}Stealing?

1616
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:10,700
{\fs14}You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

1617
02:03:10,790 --> 02:03:14,840
{\fs14}I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

1618
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:18,370
{\fs14}There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1619
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:21,970
{\fs14}Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1620
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:24,800
{\fs14}Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1621
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:27,640
{\fs14}Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1622
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:28,970
{\fs14}Stop, please.

1623
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:34,220
{\fs14}Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1624
02:03:35,070 --> 02:03:37,980
{\fs14}I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1625
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:43,070
{\fs14}Hand them over! lf these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1626
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,730
{\fs14}...l'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

1627
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:50,120
{\fs14}The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1628
02:03:51,460 --> 02:03:53,000
{\fs14}I don't want it now.

1629
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:57,910
{\fs14}Don't you hit me!

1630
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:01,590
{\fs14}Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

1631
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:04,340
{\fs14}It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1632
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:08,010
{\fs14}I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

1633
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:12,760
{\fs14}You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

1634
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:15,640
{\fs14}I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

1635
02:04:15,730 --> 02:04:18,300
{\fs14}Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce
about the coffee...

1636
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:19,980
{\fs14}...for it won't be done by me!

1637
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:23,650
{\fs14}Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

1638
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:28,150
{\fs14}Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

1639
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:32,400
{\fs14}...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1640
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:28,290
{\fs14}'"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins

{\fs14}Darling.

1659
02:07:37,290 --> 02:07:39,030
{\fs14}Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1660
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:42,990
{\fs14}Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

1661
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:44,710
{\fs14}Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1662

{\fs14}Don't you call me '"Miss Doolittle,'"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

1663
02:07:51,050 --> 02:07:54,640
{\fs14}Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1664
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:57,810
{\fs14}Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1665
02:07:57,890 --> 02:08:01,340
{\fs14}I've written two and three times a day
telling you. Sheets and sheets.

he did. Me own flesh and blood.

{\fs14}Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

1740
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:27,590
{\fs14}What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

1741
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:29,080
{\fs14}As if you didn't know.

1742
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:33,170
{\fs14}Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

1743
02:14:33,390 --> 02:14:35,010
{\fs14}What's he done to you?

1744
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:36,670
{\fs14}Ruined me, that's all.

1745
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:40,600
{\fs14}Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

1746
02:14:41,020 --> 02:14:42,390
{\fs14}And don't you defend him.

1747
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:47,020
{\fs14}Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford...

1748
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:51,270
{\fs14}...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

1749
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:56,360
{\fs14}...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1750
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:57,990
{\fs14}...a common dustman?

1751
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:01,450
{\fs14}Sounds like one of his jokes.

1752
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:04,820
{\fs14}You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1753
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:09,370
{\fs14}The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1754
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:14,920
{\fs14}Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

1755
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:19,720
{\fs14}I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1756
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:23,420
{\fs14}Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

1757
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:27,010
{\fs14}A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1758
02:15:27,730 --> 02:15:29,800
{\fs14}...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

1759
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:33,510
{\fs14}Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

1760
02:15:34,150 --> 02:15:38,810
{\fs14}I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1761
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:42,860
{\fs14}Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

1762
02:15:42,950 --> 02:15:45,160
{\fs14}-Church?
-Yeah, church.

1763
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:48,070
{\fs14}The deepest cut of all.

1764
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:51,780
{\fs14}Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1765
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:54,240
{\fs14}Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1766
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:57,170
{\fs14}Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

1767
02:15:57,460 --> 02:16:00,830
{\fs14}If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

1768
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:03,000
{\fs14}That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1769
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:05,130
{\fs14}It's easy to say chuck it...

1770
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:07,800
{\fs14}...but I 'aven't the nerve.

1771
02:16:08,140 --> 02:16:10,760
{\fs14}We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

1772
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:13,520
{\fs14}Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

1773
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:16,940
{\fs14}That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

1774
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:19,020
{\fs14}Not my precious professor.

1775
02:16:19,730 --> 02:16:21,640
{\fs14}Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1776
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:28,230
{\fs14}First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

1777
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:30,860
{\fs14}That's all part of his plan...

1778
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:33,400
{\fs14}...but you double-cross him.

1779
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,160
{\fs14}Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

1780
02:16:38,750 --> 02:16:42,290
{\fs14}You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

1781
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:45,330
{\fs14}Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

1782
02:16:46,010 --> 02:16:48,080
{\fs14}It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1783
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:52,300
{\fs14}Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

1784
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:54,960
{\fs14}St. George's, Hanover Square, 10:00.

1785
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:57,140
{\fs14}I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

1786
02:16:57,230 --> 02:16:58,720
{\fs14}No, thank you, Dad.

1787
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:02,050
{\fs14}Are you all finished here, Eliza?

1788
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:05,650
{\fs14}Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

1789

{\fs14}Good luck, Dad.

{\fs14}Thank you, Eliza.

1791
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:31,460
{\fs14}Come along, Alfie.

1792
02:17:31,550 --> 02:17:33,340
{\fs14}How much time have I got left?

You doubt a bit

We are a marvelous sex

Good-natured and kind

1953

{\fs14}Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

1954
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:26,070
{\fs14}Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is.

1955
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:31,650
{\fs14}You're quite right, it is. Good heavens.
By George, what a memory.

1956
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:35,420
{\fs14}How are you, Bruzzie?
Nice to hear your voice.

1957
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:39,830
{\fs14}What? You don't say.
Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?

1958
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:41,500
{\fs14}Right. Yes, oceans of water.

1959
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:43,830
{\fs14}Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.

1960
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,670
{\fs14}Something rather unpleasant
has happened. Could I come and see you?

1961
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,800
{\fs14}I could, yes. Now, straight away?

1962
02:28:49,890 --> 02:28:51,050
{\fs14}Right. Good. Thank you.

1963
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:53,550
{\fs14}Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.

1964
02:29:00,690 --> 02:29:03,520
{\fs14}Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along
to the Home Office.

1965
02:29:04,230 --> 02:29:06,520
{\fs14}I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

1966
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:08,400
{\fs14}Mr. Higgins will miss her.

1967
02:29:08,610 --> 02:29:12,230
{\fs14}Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!

1968
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:26,290
{\fs14}-Mrs. Pearce?
-Yes, sir.

1969
02:29:26,670 --> 02:29:27,670
{\fs14}Where's the Colonel?

1970
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,910
{\fs14}He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

1971
02:29:30,970 --> 02:29:35,920
{\fs14}There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs
for help. Now there's a good fellow.

1972
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:40,140
{\fs14}Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

{\fs14}You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...

1990
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:43,030
{\fs14}...without making a mistake...

1991
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,110
{\fs14}...they just sat there
and never said a word?

1992
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,990
{\fs14}Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

1993
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:49,750
{\fs14}Not a word.

1994
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:53,030
{\fs14}They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.

1995
02:30:53,130 --> 02:30:55,620
{\fs14}The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

1996
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:57,500
{\fs14}...and what a bore it had all been.

1997
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:00,840
{\fs14}This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

1998
02:31:00,930 --> 02:31:03,170
{\fs14}I should have thrown the fire irons.

1999
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:04,470
{\fs14}Who's that?

2000
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:07,300
{\fs14}Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

2001
02:31:08,890 --> 02:31:10,270
{\fs14}Now, remember...

2002
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:15,350
{\fs14}...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

2003
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,940
{\fs14}Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

2004
02:31:28,490 --> 02:31:29,410
{\fs14}You!

2005
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:33,360
{\fs14}Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2006
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:38,960
{\fs14}Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2007
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:42,620
{\fs14}Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2008
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:44,460
{\fs14}Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

2009
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:46,090
{\fs14}You've caused me enough trouble.

2010
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:50,170
{\fs14}Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

2011
02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:51,840
{\fs14}How did this baggage get here?

2012
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:54,880
{\fs14}Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2013
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:57,930
{\fs14}If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

2014
02:31:58,020 --> 02:32:00,010
{\fs14}I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

2015
02:32:00,110 --> 02:32:03,890
{\fs14}...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

2016
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:05,730
{\fs14}That's precisely what I mean.

2017
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:07,400
{\fs14}I'll see her damned first.

2018
02:32:07,490 --> 02:32:10,610
{\fs14}However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2019
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:15,150
{\fs14}It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

2020
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,870
{\fs14}...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

2021
02:32:19,290 --> 02:32:21,530
{\fs14}He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

2022
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:24,990
{\fs14}...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2023
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:31,210
{\fs14}You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

2024
02:32:31,380 --> 02:32:35,130
{\fs14}...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

2025
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:37,010
{\fs14}...but how she is treated.

2026
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:42,300
{\fs14}I'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

2027
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:46,010
{\fs14}...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2028
02:32:46,730 --> 02:32:48,850
{\fs14}I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2029
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:52,230
{\fs14}...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2030
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:58,580
{\fs14}Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2031
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:01,490
{\fs14}The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2032
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:04,070
{\fs14}The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

2033
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:05,990
{\fs14}I should be excommunicated.

2034
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:08,200
{\fs14}I'll see him in the library.

2035
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:11,630
{\fs14}Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2036
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,540
{\fs14}...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2037
02:33:14,630 --> 02:33:18,840
{\fs14}Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

2038
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:48,700
{\fs14}You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

2039
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:52,210
{\fs14}Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

2040
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:54,290
{\fs14}You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

2041
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:57,410
{\fs14}...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2042
02:33:57,510 --> 02:33:59,300
{\fs14}I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

2043
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:00,760
{\fs14}Then what are we talking about?

2044
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:02,470
{\fs14}Well, about you, not about me.

2045
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:05,260
{\fs14}If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

2046
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:07,590
{\fs14}I can't change my nature or my manners.

2047
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,520
{\fs14}My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

2048
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:14,380
{\fs14}That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2049
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,760
{\fs14}I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2050
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:19,020
{\fs14}I see. The same to everybody.

2051
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:22,240
{\fs14}The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

2052
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:25,770
{\fs14}...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

2053
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:29,650
{\fs14}...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2054
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,940
{\fs14}The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

2055
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:37,460
{\fs14}...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2056
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:39,500
{\fs14}I don't care how you treat me.

2057
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:42,670
{\fs14}I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

2058
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:45,840
{\fs14}I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over!

2059
02:34:46,050 --> 02:34:47,920
{\fs14}Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2060
02:34:48,010 --> 02:34:50,130
{\fs14}You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

2061
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:54,430
{\fs14}So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2062
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:57,440
{\fs14}But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

2063
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:59,930
{\fs14}I know you can. I told you, you could.

2064
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,930
{\fs14}You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

2065
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:08,570
{\fs14}...whether I could get along without you?

2066
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:12,690
{\fs14}Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

2067
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:16,530
{\fs14}So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

2068
02:35:19,670 --> 02:35:23,880
{\fs14}I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

2069
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:27,080
{\fs14}I confess that humbly and gratefully.

2070
02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:32,420
{\fs14}Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2071
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:37,010
{\fs14}When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

2072
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:41,270
{\fs14}Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2073
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:46,180
{\fs14}You are a devil!

2074
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:49,640
{\fs14}You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

2075
02:35:49,730 --> 02:35:52,190
{\fs14}...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2076
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:54,110
{\fs14}What am I to come back for?

2077
02:35:54,450 --> 02:35:56,520
{\fs14}For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

2078
02:35:56,620 --> 02:35:59,370
{\fs14}You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2079
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:02,870
{\fs14}Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2080
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,150
{\fs14}And live with my father?

2081
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:06,790
{\fs14}Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2082
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,620
{\fs14}I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2083
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:13,920
{\fs14}-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.

2084
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:16,840
{\fs14}That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

2085
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:19,170
{\fs14}I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2086
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:22,350
{\fs14}Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2087
02:36:22,430 --> 02:36:26,380
{\fs14}In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2088
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:30,470
{\fs14}No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2089
02:36:31,570 --> 02:36:33,310
{\fs14}I want a little kindness.

2090
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:37,430
{\fs14}I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2091
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:39,770
{\fs14}...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

2092
02:36:40,030 --> 02:36:45,030
{\fs14}What I done...what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2093
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:49,120
{\fs14}...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to...came...

2094
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:51,950
{\fs14}...to care for you.

2095
02:36:52,250 --> 02:36:54,040
{\fs14}Not to want you to make love to me...

2096
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:57,210
{\fs14}...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2097
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,960
{\fs14}...more friendly like.

2098
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:03,420
{\fs14}Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2099
02:37:04,050 --> 02:37:07,640
{\fs14}And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2100
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:09,100
{\fs14}That's not the proper answer.

2101
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:11,140
{\fs14}It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2102
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:13,390
{\fs14}To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2103
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:16,100
{\fs14}...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2104
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:18,230
{\fs14}...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2105
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:20,720
{\fs14}You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2106
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:22,900
{\fs14}Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2107
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:24,900
{\fs14}Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2108
02:37:24,990 --> 02:37:27,740
{\fs14}...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2109
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:30,990
{\fs14}If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2110
02:37:31,330 --> 02:37:34,160
{\fs14}I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2111
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:35,960
{\fs14}I'm always in the wrong.

2112
02:37:36,170 --> 02:37:38,410
{\fs14}Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2113
02:37:38,500 --> 02:37:40,630
{\fs14}...to be trampled on and talked down.

2114
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:44,250
{\fs14}I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

2115
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:48,340
{\fs14}The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

2116
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:50,390
{\fs14}...even if he had the guts to try?

2117
02:37:50,470 --> 02:37:54,220
{\fs14}Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

2118
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:57,350
{\fs14}Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2119
02:37:57,440 --> 02:38:00,440
{\fs14}I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

2120
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:02,270
{\fs14}I'll go and be a teacher.

2121
02:38:02,690 --> 02:38:04,680
{\fs14}What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2122
02:38:04,780 --> 02:38:07,310
{\fs14}What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

2123
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:15,950
{\fs14}I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2124
02:38:16,830 --> 02:38:20,490
{\fs14}What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2125
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:23,030
{\fs14}Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

2126
02:38:23,130 --> 02:38:25,750
{\fs14}You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!

2127
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,290
{\fs14}Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2128
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:35,510
{\fs14}That's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2129

{\fs14}Now, I don't care for your bullyin'

{\fs14}Good enough for what?

{\fs14}...at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.

2258
02:48:55,500 --> 02:49:00,000
{\fs14}But they won't take me unless I can talk
more genteel. He said he could teach me.

{\fs14}Well, 'ere I am ready to pay. Not askin'
any favor, and he treats me as if I was dirt.

{\fs14}I know what lessons cost as well as you do

{\fs14}It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.

2263
02:49:19,190 --> 02:49:21,770
{\fs14}So horribly dirty. I'll take it.

{\fs14}I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

2265
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:30,330
{\fs14}I washed my face and 'ands
before I come, I did.

{\fs14}Where the devil are my slippers?
