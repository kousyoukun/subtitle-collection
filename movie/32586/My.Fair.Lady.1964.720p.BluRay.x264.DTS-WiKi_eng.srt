Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman. Look at his boots .

Madam , it's stopped raining.

You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court

66

That 's where you live, isn 't it

67

He's no gentleman, he ain't, to interfere with a poor girl!

How do you do it, may l ask?

78

Simple phonetics The science of speech. That 's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,107
Anyone can spot an lrishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

A woman who utters such disgusting and depressing noises ..

has no right to be anywhere, no right to live.

90

Remember, you're a human being with a soul...

91

00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,267
Might l 'ave the pleasure of a word with you?

307
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:48,077
Oh, no. This is the girl ljotted down last night

308
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,210
She's no use . l've got the records l want of the Lisson Grove lingo.

309
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,208
l'm not gonna waste another cylinder on that .

310
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:54,915
Now be of with you. l don't want you.

311
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,050
Don't be so saucy. You ain't 'eard what l come for yet

312
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,124
Did you tell 'im l come in a taxi?

313
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:03,255
Nonsense , girl. What do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares ..

314
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,526
what you came in?

315
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,157
Oh, we are proud.

316
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:09,531
Well, 'e ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im. l 'eard 'im say so .

317
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:11,764
lain't come here t' as for any compliment ..

318
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,604
and if my money's not good enough, l can go elsewhere.

319
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,075
Good enough for what ?

320
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,973
Good enough for you.

321
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,947
Now you know, don'tcha l'm come to 'ave lessons, l am .

322
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,178
And to pay for 'em too, make no mistake.

323
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,709
Well!

324
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:29,013
And what do you expect me to say?

325
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:33,056
Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, l think.

326
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,124
Don't l tell you l'm bringin' you business ?

327
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:38,854
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

328
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:41,232
or shall we just throw her out of the window?

329
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:45,224
l won't be called a baggage. Not when l've ofered to pay like any lady.

330
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:48,233
What do you want , my girl?

331
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:54,878
l want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

332
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,373
'stead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road .

333
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:00,216
But they won't take me unless l can talk more genteel.

334
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,585
'<i>E</i> said 'e could teach me .

335
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,749
Well, 'ere l am ready to pay 'im.

336
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,056
Not asking any favor and he treats me as if l was dirt

337
00:29:07,763 --> 00:29:11,620
l know what lessons cost as well as you do, and l'm ready t' pay .

338
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:15,934
How much?

339
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:18,293
Now you're talkin'.

340
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,834
lthought you'd come of it for a chance o' gettin' back a bit ..

341
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,831
of what you chucked at me last night

342
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,867
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you, eh?

343
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:26,140
Sit down.

344
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:29,375
-lf you're goin' t' make a compliment of it- - -Sit down!

345
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,545
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

346
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,553
What 's your name?

347
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,611
<i>E</i>liza Doolittle.

348
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,715
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

349
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:45,088
l don't mind if l do.

350
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:51,865
How much do you propose to pay me for these lesson<i>s</i>

351
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:53,563
Oh, l know what 's right

352
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:56,530
A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour...

353
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:58,442
from a real French gentleman.

354
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,974
You wouldn't have the face t' as me the same ...

355
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,882
for teachin' me my own language as you would for French.

356
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,841
So, l won't give more than a shillin'. Take it or leave it

357
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,086
Do you know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling...

358
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:16,651
not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income ...

359
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,928
it works out as fully equivalent of. ..

360
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,093
60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

361
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,364
By George, it's enormous lt's the biggest ofer l ever had .

362
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:32,868
Sixty pound<i>s</i> What are you talkin' about Where would l get 60 pound<i>s</i>

363
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,904
l never ofered you 60 pounds

364
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,848
But l ain't got 60 pounds

365
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,911
Don't cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody's going to touch your money.

366
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:44,015
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick if you don't stop sniveling.

367
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,457
Sit down!

368
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,891
Anybody'd think you was my father!

369
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:55,298
lf l decide to teach you, l'll be worse than two fathers to you.

370
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,427
Here.

371
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:58,797
What 's this for?

372
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:02,537
To wipe your eyes To wipe any part of your face that feels mois

373
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,508
Remember, that 's your handkerchief and that 's your sleeve.

374
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,175
Don't confuse the one with the other if you want to become a lady in a shop.

375
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:13,244
lt's no use to talk to her like that , Mr. Higgins She doesn 't understand you.

376
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:16,619
'<i>E</i>re! Give the 'ankerchief to me . He give it to me , not to you!

377
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,149
Higgins, l'm interested.

378
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:20,658
What about your boast ..

379
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,584
that you could pass her of as a duchess at the <i>E</i>mbassy Ball?

380
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,327
l'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you do that .

381
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:30,497
l'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can' t do it

382
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:32,668
l'll even pay for the lessons

383
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,437
Aw, you're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n .

384
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,801
lt's almost irresistible.

385
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,814
She's so deliciously low.

386
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,443
So horribly dirty .

387
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,977
lain't dirty ! l washed my face an' hands before l come , l did.

388
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,978
l'll take it l'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

389
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:57,089
We'll start today . This moment Take her away , Mrs Pearce, and clean her.

390
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,589
Sandpaper, if it won't come of any other way . ls there a fire in the kitchen?

391
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,729
Take all her clothes of and burn them and order some new ones

392
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:06,433
Just wrap her in brown paper till they come .

393
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:10,503
You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk o' such things

394
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,069
l'm a good girl, l am .

395
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,978
And l know what the likes of you are, l do.

396
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,847
We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman.

397
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,384
You've got to learn to behave like a duchess .

398
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:24,914
Take 'er away , Mrs Pearce, an'if she gives you any trouble wallop 'er.

399
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,824
l'll call the police, l will.

400
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,522
l've got no place to put her.

401
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:30,292
Well, put her in the dustbin.

402
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,524
Come , Higgins, be reasonable.

403
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:36,196
You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins, really you mus

404
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:38,694
You can' t walk over everybody like this

405
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,567
l?

406
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,175
Walk over everybody?

407
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:49,444
My dear Mrs Pearce, my dear Pickering, l had no intention of walking over anyone.

408
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:52,577
lmerely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.

409
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:57,349
l didn't express myself clearly because l didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

410
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,884
or yours

411
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:02,054
But, sir, you can' t take a girl up like that ...

412
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,721
as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.

413
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,093
Why not

414
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:08,997
Why not But you don't know anything about her.

415
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,934
What about her parents ? She may be married.

416
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,401
Garn!

417
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,836
There. As the girl very properly says, garn!

418
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:19,273
Who'd marry me ?

419
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,513
By George, <i>E</i>liza ..

420
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:27,709
the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men...

421
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:31,279
shooting themselves for your sake before l've done with you.

422
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:33,919
'<i>E</i>re.

423
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,255
l'm goin'.

424
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:39,124
He's of his chump , he is l don't want no balmies teachin' me .

425
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,363
Mad , am l? All right, Mrs Pearce, don't order those new clothes

426
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,667
-Throw her out -Stop, Mr. Higgins l won't allow it

427
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,229
Go home to your parents , girl.

428
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:48,070
lain't got no parents .

429
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,301
She ain't got no parents . What 's the fuss about

430
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,711
Nobody wants her. She's no use to anybody but me . Take her upstairs

431
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,273
What 's to become of her? ls she to be paid anything?

432
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,342
Oh, do be sensible, sir.

433
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,513
What would she do with money? She'll have food and clothes

434
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:02,180
She'll only drink if you give her money.

435
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,213
You are a brute ! lt's a lie!

436
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,590
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me .

437
00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:09,989
Sir, you're a gentleman. Don't let 'im speak to me like that !

438
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,989
Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feeling<i>s</i>

439
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:16,201
No, l don't think so . No feelings we need worry about

440
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,763
Well, have you, <i>E</i>liza

441

l got me feelings same as anyone else .

442
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:23,608
Mr. Higgins, l must know on what terms the girl is to be here.

443
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,073
What 's to become of her when you've finished your teaching?

444
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,012
You must look ahead a little, sir.

445
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,348
What 's to become of her if we leave her in the gutter, Mrs Pearce?

446
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,751
That 's her own business , not yours, Mr. Higgins

447
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,483
When l'm done we'll throw her back.

448
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:38,583
Then it'll be her own business again. That 'll be all right, won't it

449
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,424
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya

450
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,028
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

l've 'ad enough of this l'm goin', l am !

452
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,760
You ought to be ashamed of yourself

00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,498
Have some chocolates, <i>E</i>liza

00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:08,979
And you take the other.

459
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,322
You'll have boxes of them barrels of them every day .

460
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:17,530
You'll live on them eh?

461
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:22,857
l wouldn't 've ate it, only l'm too laidylike to take it out o' me mouth .

462
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:26,395
Think of it, <i>E</i>liza Think of chocolates, and taxis ..

463
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:29,141
and gold and diamonds

464
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:34,243
l don't want no gold and no diamonds l'm a good girl, l am .

465
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:38,141
Higgins, l really must interfere. Mrs Pearce is quite right

466
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,052
lf this girl's going to put herself in your hands for six months ..

467
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:45,286
for an experiment in teaching, she mus understand thoroughly what she's doing.

468
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,925
You are to stay here for the next six months ..

469
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,993
learning how to speak beautifully like a lady in a florist shop.

470
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:00,936
lf you're good and do what you're told, you shall sleep in a proper bedroom. ..

472
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,847
But if you are naughty and idle...

473
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,772
you shall sleep in the kitchen amongst the black beetles ..

474
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,708
and be walloped by Mrs Pearce with a broomstick.

475
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:20,046
At the end of six months, you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

476
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,784
in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

477
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:26,956
lf the King finds out that you are not a lady...

478
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:31,128
the police will take you to the Tower of London where your head will be cut of ...

479
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:34,464
as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls

480
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:38,309
But if you are not found out you shall have a present of. ..

481
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:43,245
seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop.

482
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,508
lf you refuse this ofer...

483
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:50,547
you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl...

484
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,586
and the angels will weep for you!

485
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,294
Now are you satisfied, Pickering?

486
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,234
l don't understand what you are talking about

487
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,795
Could l put it more plainly or fairly, Mrs Pearce?

488
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,772
Come with me .

489
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,639
That 's right Bundle her of to the bathroom.

490
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:12,009
You're a great bully, you are!

491
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,876
l won't stay here if l don't like it l won't let nobody wallop me !

492
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,746
Don't answer back, girl.

493
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:20,342
l've always been a good girl, l 'ave.

494
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,150
ln six months- - ln three, if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

495
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,786
l'll take her anywhere and l'll pass her of as anything.

496
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:30,524
l'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

497
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:41,162
l've never had a bath in me life . Not what you'd call a proper one.

498
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:44,507
You know you can' t be a nice girl inside if you're dirty outside.

499
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,413
l'll have to put you in here. This will be your bedroom.

500
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,714
Oh, l couldn't sleep in here, Missus

501
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,788
lt's too good for the likes o' me .

502
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,120
lshould be afraid to touch anythin'.

503
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,992
lain't a duchess yet, you know.

504
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:12,193
What 's thi<i>s</i> This where you wash clothe<i>s</i>

505

This is where we wash ourselves, <i>E</i>liza And where l'm going to wash you.

506
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:20,242
You expect me to get into that and wet meself all over?

507
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:21,441
Not me !

508
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,754

509
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,352
Come along now.

510
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:35,083

Take your hands of me !

00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,827
lt ain't right lt ain't decent

517
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:28,842
<i>Get your hands off me!</i>

518
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:38,655
<i>l'm a good girl, l am!</i>

519
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,368
Forgive the bluntness , but if l'm to be in this business ...

520
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:57,604
lshall feel responsible for the girl.

521
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:01,409
l hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.

522
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,144
What , that thing? Sacred, l assure you.

523
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:07,278
Come now, you know what l mea This is no trifling matter.

524
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:10,779
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

525
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:15,092
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

526
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,154
Yes, very frequently.

527
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:20,698
l haven't l find that the moment l let a woman make friends with me ...

528
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,066
she becomes jealous, exacting...

529
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:25,230
suspicious and a damned nuisance.

530
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,701
lfind the moment that l make friends with a woman l become selfish and tyrannical .

531
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,177
So here l am , a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so .

532
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,672
Well, after all, Pickering--

533
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:37,912
<i>l'm an ordinary man</i>

534
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,346
<i>Who desires nothing more</i>

535
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,544
<i>Than just an ordinary chance</i>

536
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,020
<i>To live exactly as he likes</i>

537
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,254
<i>And do precisely what he wants</i>

538

<i>An average man am l</i>

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,686
<i>Of no eccentric whim</i>

540

<i>Who likes to live his life</i>

541
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:55,197
<i>Free of strife</i>

542
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,033
<i>Doing whatever he thinks is best for him</i>

543
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,569
<i>Oh, just an ordinary man</i>

544
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,540
<i>But let a woman in your life</i>

545
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,238

<i>She'll redecorate your home</i> <i>From the cellar to the dome</i>

547
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:17,580

<i>Let a woman in your life</i>

00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,721
M<i>ake a plan and you will find</i> <i>She has something else in mind</i>

551
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:30,327
<i>And so rather than do either</i> <i>You do something else that neither</i>

552
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,632
<i>Likes at all!</i>

553
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,436
<i>You want to talk of Keats or</i> M<i>ilton</i>

554
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,973
<i>She only wants to talk of love</i>

555
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:41,043
<i>You go to see a play or ballet</i>

556
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:43,781
<i>And spend it searching for her glove</i>

557

<i>Let a woman in your life</i>

558

<i>Let them buy their wedding bands</i>

Your daughter, <i>E</i>liza

You're a lucky man, Alfile Doolittle.

He don't know. Her own father an' he don't know.

Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

677
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,717
But she says

678
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:04,520
''Never mind about sending any clothes ''

679
00:49:08,162 --> 00:49:10,892

Laddie boy, we're in for a booze-up.

The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

Pay the bills and say no to the invitations

704
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,871
You simply cannot go on working the girl this way .

705
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:44,177
Making her say her alphabet over and over...

706

from sunup to sundown, even during meals

707
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:49,814
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

When she does it properly, of course . ls that all, Mrs Pearce?

There's another letter from that Americanillionaire, <i>E</i>zra D. Wallingford.

Well, send the blackguard up.

718
00:52:22,156 --> 00:52:24,044
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins

719
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,853
Oh, nonsense . O' course he's a blackguard, Pickering.

720
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:29,316
l'm afraid we'll have some trouble with him.

721

No, l think not Any trouble to be had , he'll have it with me . Not l with him.

Brought up in Houndslow.

728
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:03,226
Mother Welsh , l should think.

00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:05,922
What is it you want , Doolittle?

730
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:08,388
l want my daughter, that 's what l want . See?

731
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:11,160
Of course you do. You're her father, aren't you?

732
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:13,866
l'm glad to see you have a spark of family feeling left .

733
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,569
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

734
00:53:16,743 --> 00:53:17,767
What ?

735
00:53:18,312 --> 00:53:21,975
Take her away . Do you think l am going to keep your daughter for you?

736
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:25,146
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

737
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:28,345
ls it fairity to take advantage of a man like that ?

738
00:53:28,522 --> 00:53:31,787
The girl belongs to me . You got 'er. Where do l come in?

739
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:35,922
How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me !

740
00:53:36,496 --> 00:53:38,088
You sent her here on purpose !

741
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,898
Don't take a man up like that , Governor.

742
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:44,230
The police shall take you up. This is a pla ..

743
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,693
a plot to extort money by threats

744
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:48,434
lshall telephone the police.

745
00:53:48,842 --> 00:53:51,834
Have l asked you for a brass farthin'?

746
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:55,611
l leave it to this gentleman 'ere. Have l said a word about money?

747
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:57,972
Well, what else did you come for?

748
00:54:00,087 --> 00:54:02,078
What would a bloke come for?

749
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,344
Be 'uman, Governor.

750
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:12,387
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose .

751
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:14,227
So help me , Governor, l never did.

752
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:15,529
Then how did you know she was here?

753
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:18,526
l'd tell you, Governor, if you'd only let me get a word in.

l'm waiting to tell ya

756
00:54:25,379 --> 00:54:29,236
You know, Pickering, this chap 's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

757
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,539
Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.

758
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,641
''l'm willing to tell you. l'm wanting to tell you. l'm waiting to tell you.''

759
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,018
That 's the Welsh strain in 'im.

760
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:41,918
How did you know <i>E</i>liza was here if you didn't send 'er?

761
00:54:41,995 --> 00:54:45,453
Well, she sent back for her luggage and l got to 'ear about it

762
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,295
She said she didn't want no clothes

763
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:53,566
What was l to think from that , Governor? lask you, as a parent, what was l to think?

764
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:57,772
So you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?

765
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,534
-Yes, sir, Governor. That 's right -Yes

766
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:02,413
Mrs Pearce!

767
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,308
<i>E</i>liza' s father has come to take her away . Give her to him will you?

768
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,777
Now wait a minute , Governor. Wait a minute .

769
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:14,420
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

770
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:19,024
Men of the world, are we? Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs Pearce.

771
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,589
lthink so indeed, sir!

772
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,258
Here, Governor.

773
00:55:22,936 --> 00:55:25,860
l've took a sort of a fancy to you and ...

774
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:32,565
if you want the girl, l ain't so set on 'avin' her back home again...

775
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:35,570
but what l might be open to is an arrangement

776
00:55:35,983 --> 00:55:38,474
All l ask is my rights as a father.

777
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:42,147
You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.

778
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:45,754
l can see you're o' the straight sort, Governor.

779
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:46,884
So...

780
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:50,915
what 's a five pound note to you? An' what 's <i>E</i>liza to me ?

781
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,260
lthink you ought to know, Doolittle...

782
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,359
that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable.

783
00:55:56,903 --> 00:56:00,725
Of course they are, Governor. lf l thought they wasn't, l'd ask 50.

784
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:04,096
Do you mean to say you'd sell your daughter for 50 pound<i>s</i>

785
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:05,906
Have you no morals, man?

786
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,737
No, l can' t afford 'em Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me .

787
00:56:13,086 --> 00:56:15,316
Not that l mean any 'arm mind ya, but ..

788
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:18,881
if <i>E</i>liza is gonna have a bit out o' this, why not me , too?

789
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,286
Why not

790
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,794
Well, look....

791
00:56:24,164 --> 00:56:26,689
Look at it my way . What am l?

792
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:31,797
lask ya, what am l? l'm one o' the undeserving poor, that 's what l am .

793
00:56:31,872 --> 00:56:33,897
Now think what that means to a man.

794
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,671
lt means he's up agains middle-class morality for all the time .

795
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:42,044
lf there's anything goin' an' l puts in for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

796
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:44,345
''You're undeservin', so you can' t have it ''

797
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:49,111
But my needs is as great as the mos deservin' widows that ever got money...

798
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:53,387
out of six diferent charities in one week for the death o' the same 'usband .

799
00:56:53,794 --> 00:56:57,286
l don't need less than a deservin' man, l need more.

800
00:56:57,764 --> 00:57:00,756
l don't eat less 'earty than he does and l drink...

801
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:02,661
a lot more.

802
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:04,798
l'm playin' straight with you.

803
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,903
lain't pretendin' to be deservin'. No, l'm undeservin'...

804
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,031
And I mean to go on bein' undeservin'. I like it an' that 's the truth.

805
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:16,999
But will you take advantage of a man's nature...

806
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,501
do him out of the price of his own daughter, what he's brought up...

807
00:57:20,578 --> 00:57:23,240
fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow...

808
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:28,879
till she's growed big enough to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

809
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,121
Is five pounds unreasonable, I put it to you?

810
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:36,152
And I leave it to you.

811
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:42,592
You know, Pickering, if we took this man in hand for three months...

812
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,524
he could choose between a seat in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales

813
00:57:47,472 --> 00:57:51,238
- We'd better give 'im a fiver. - He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

814
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,368
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't

815
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:55,935
Just one good spree for meself an' the missus...

816
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,971
givin' pleasure to ourselves and employment to others

817
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,080
An' satisfaction to you to know it ain't been throwed away.

818
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:03,848
You couldn't spend it better.

819
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:06,253
Oh, this is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

820
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:09,288
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart to spend ten, Governor.

821
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,055
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

822
00:58:11,129 --> 00:58:14,690
Makes a man feel prudent-like, and then goodbye to 'appiness.

823
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:18,921
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor. Not a penny less, not a penny more.

824
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:22,570
I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

825
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,733
Why don't you marry that missus of <i>yours</i>

826
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:28,108
After all, marriage isn 't so frightening. You married Eliza' s mother.

827
00:58:28,312 --> 00:58:29,802
Who told you that, Governor?

828
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:32,847
Well, nobody told me. I concluded, naturally...

829
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:40,151
If we listen to this man for another minute we shall have no convictions left.

830
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:43,113
- Five pounds, I think you said. - Thank you, Governor.

831
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,726
Are you sure you won't have ten?

832
00:58:44,796 --> 00:58:47,094
No. No, perhaps another time.

833
00:58:49,033 --> 00:58:50,295
I beg your pardon, Miss.

834
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:53,132
I won't say those ruddy vowels one more time.

835
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:54,864
Blimey, it's Eliza

836
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:57,767
Well, I never thought she'd clean up so good-looking.

837
00:58:57,842 --> 00:58:59,867
She does me credit, don't she, Governor?

838
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:02,469
Here! What are you doin' here?

839
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:07,007
Now, you hold your tongue and don't you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

840
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:10,908
If you have any trouble with 'er, give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

841
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:13,286
That 's the way to improve 'er mind.

842
00:59:13,558 --> 00:59:16,083
Well, good morning, gentlemen. Cheerio, Eliza

843
00:59:19,964 --> 00:59:23,661
There's a man for you. A philosophical genius of the first water.

844
00:59:25,236 --> 00:59:27,534
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford and tell him...

845
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,938
if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

846
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:34,341
a common dustman, one o' the most original moralists in England.

847
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,877
'Ere, what did he come for?

848
00:59:37,148 --> 00:59:38,172
Say your vowels

849
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:40,308
I know me vowels I knew 'em before I come.

850
00:59:40,384 --> 00:59:41,681
If you know them say them.

851
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:44,846
Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.

852
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:48,121
A, <i>E,</i> I, O, U.

853
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,483
That 's what I said. Ahyee, e, lyee, ow, you.

854
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:54,190
That 's what I been sayin' for three days an'I won't say 'em no more.

855
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:57,257
I know it's dificult, Miss Doolittle, but try to understand.

856
00:59:57,702 --> 01:00:00,933
There's no use explaining. As a military man you ought to know that.

857
01:00:01,005 --> 01:00:02,529
Drilling is what she needs

858
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:04,973
Leave her alone or she'll be turning to you for sympathy.

859
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:08,136
Very well, if you insis but have a little patience with her.

860
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:09,440
Of course.

861
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:11,480
Say "A."

862
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,777
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't

863
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:25,251
I promise you you'll say your vowels correctly before this day is out...

864
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,987
or there'll be no lunch, no dinner, and no chocolates

912
01:04:46,157 --> 01:04:48,182
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

913
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,322
Now, you see that flame?

914
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,356
<i>Every time you pronounce the letter "H" correctly the flame will waver...

915
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:01,596
and every time you drop your "H" the flame will remain stationary.

916
01:05:01,672 --> 01:05:03,196
That 's how to know you've done it correctly.

917
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,162
In time, your ear will hear the diference.

918
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:08,871
You'll see it better in the mirror. Now listen carefully.

919
01:05:09,814 --> 01:05:12,738
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

920
01:05:13,184 --> 01:05:16,210
"hurricanes hardly ever happen."

921
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:19,652
Now you repeat that after me.

922
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:23,690
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."

923
01:05:23,994 --> 01:05:28,886
"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire 'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen."

924
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:30,694
Oh, no, no, no!

925
01:05:30,835 --> 01:05:32,632
Have you no ear at all?

926
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,829
- Should I do it over? - No, please.

927
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,800
Start from the very beginning. Just do this

928
01:05:47,518 --> 01:05:49,179
Go on, go on, go on.

929
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,320
Does the same thing hold true in India

930
01:05:55,392 --> 01:05:58,486
Have they the peculiar habit of not only dropping a letter...

931
01:05:58,562 --> 01:06:01,861
but using it where it doesn 't belong, like "hever" instead of "ever"?

932
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,116
The girl, Higgins

933
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,385
Go on. Go on.

934
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,194
<i>Poor Professor Higgins</i>

935
01:06:34,598 --> 01:06:37,487

01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:47,301
<i>Oh, poor Professor Higgins</i>

938
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:52,805
<i>All day long on his feet</i>

939
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:57,275
<i>Up and down until he's numb</i>

940
01:06:57,821 --> 01:07:01,712
<i>Doesn't rest, doesn't eat</i>

941
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,956
<i>Doesn't touch a crumb</i>

942
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:10,293
Again, Eliza

943
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:13,490
How kind of you to let me come.

944
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:17,460
How kind of you to let me come.

945
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:20,066
No. Kind of you. Kind of you. Kind...

946
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:23,270
How kind of you to let me come.

947
01:07:23,814 --> 01:07:26,840
How kind of you to let me come.

948
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:29,283
Kind of you. Kind of you. It's like "cup of tea"

949
01:07:29,353 --> 01:07:31,878
Kind of you. Cup of tea Say, say "cup of tea"

950
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:33,378
Cuppatea

951
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:35,788
No. "A cup of tea"

952
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:39,482
It's awfully good cake. I wonder where Mrs Pearce gets it

953
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:44,720
First rate. And those strawberry tarts are delicious Did you try the pline cake?

954
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:51,971
Try it again.

955
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,031
- Did you try the... - Pickering!

956
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:56,910
Again, Eliza

957
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:58,275
Cuppatea

958
01:07:58,349 --> 01:07:59,407
Oh, no.

959
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:01,508
Can' t you hear the diference?

960
01:08:01,585 --> 01:08:06,318
Look, put your tongue forward until it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

961
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,017
And then say "cup."

962
01:08:10,527 --> 01:08:11,653
Then say "of."

963
01:08:12,196 --> 01:08:14,960
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of of of of."

964
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:21,262
By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea

965
01:08:21,405 --> 01:08:24,431
You finish the last strawberry tart I couldn't eat another thing.

966
01:08:24,508 --> 01:08:26,635
- I couldn't touch it - Shame to waste it

967
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:31,500
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

968
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:44,455
<i>Poor Professor Higgins</i>

969
01:08:45,963 --> 01:08:48,693

Five.

01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:22,189
Six marbles

978

I want you to read this and I want you to enunciate...

979
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:29,861
every word just as if the marbles were not in your mouth.

980

I can' t

987
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:50,424
Isay, Higgins, are those pebbles really necessary?

988
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:55,025
If they were necessary for Demosthenes they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

989
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:56,797
Go on, Eliza

990
01:09:57,201 --> 01:10:01,023

"were thickly crusted, one and all."

995
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:16,479
Perhaps the poem is a little too dificult for the girl.

996
01:10:16,553 --> 01:10:20,045
Why don't you try something simpler, like <i>The Owl and the Pussycat?</i>

997
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:22,251
Yes, that 's a charming one.

01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:25,485
Pickering, I can' t hear a word the girl is saying!

For God's sake, Higgins, it must be three o'clock in the morning.

1016
01:11:34,364 --> 01:11:35,763
Do be reasonable.

1017

But think what you're trying to accomplish.

1023
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:08,625
Just think what you're dealing with.

1024
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:13,465
The majesty and grandeur of the English language...

1025
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,131
It's the greatest possession we have.

And conquer it you will.

1031
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:04,048

Are you feeling all right, Mr. <i>Higgins</i>

Let's test her in public and see how she fares

1060
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:03,586
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened by a dreadful pounding.

1061

Do you know what it might have been?

1062
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:07,591
I didn't hear any pounding. Did you, Pickering?

1063
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:10,861
If this goes on, Mrs Pearce, you'd better see a doctor.

- I know. We'll take her to the races - The <i>races</i>

- You'll consult your mother firs - Yes, of course.

1067
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:24,648
No, I think we'd better surprise her. Now let's go to bed.

01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:27,677
First thing in the morning, we'll go out and buy her a dress.

1069
01:16:27,757 --> 01:16:29,418
Now get on with your work, Eliza

1070
01:16:29,493 --> 01:16:31,518
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1071
01:16:31,595 --> 01:16:34,086
What better time to work than early in the morning?

1072
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:36,853
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1073
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,229
Whitely's, of course.

1074
01:16:38,368 --> 01:16:39,460
How do you know that?

1075
01:16:39,536 --> 01:16:40,798
Common knowledge.

1076
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,968
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1077
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:47,305
I despise those gowns with, sort of weeds here and weeds there.

1078
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:50,110
We'll buy something sort of simple and modes...

1079
01:16:50,313 --> 01:16:52,577
and elegant. That 's what 's called for.

1080
01:16:52,716 --> 01:16:54,877
Perhaps with a bow.

1081
01:16:56,286 --> 01:16:57,776
Yes That 's just right

1082
01:17:02,526 --> 01:17:04,721
You've all been working much too hard. Ithink the strain is beginning to show.

1083
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:07,126
<i>Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says

1084
01:17:07,197 --> 01:17:09,461
You must put down your books and go to bed.

1085
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:12,790
<i>Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed</i>

1086
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:16,461
<i>My head's too light to try to set it down</i>

1087
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:22,698
<i>Sleep! Sleep! I couldn't sleep tonight</i>

1088
01:17:23,046 --> 01:17:27,142
<i>Not for all the jewels in the crown!</i>

1089
01:17:28,985 --> 01:17:31,977
<i>I could have danced all night</i>

1090
01:17:32,289 --> 01:17:35,281
<i>I could have danced all night</i>

1091
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:40,323
<i>And still have begged for more</i>

1092
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:44,723
<i>I could have spread my wings</i>

1093
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,924
<i>And done a thousand things</i>

1094
01:17:48,338 --> 01:17:52,661
<i>I've never done before</i>

1095
01:17:54,511 --> 01:17:59,175
<i>I'll never know what made it so exciting</i>

1096
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:05,746
<i>Why all at once my heart took flight</i>

1097
01:18:07,357 --> 01:18:12,351
<i>I only know when he</i>

1098
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,222
<i>Began to dance with me</i>

1099
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:20,860
<i>I could have danced, danced, danced</i>

1100
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:24,069
<i>all night!</i>

1101
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,912
It's after three now.

1102
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,382
Don't you agree now?

1103
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:44,624
She ought to be in bed!

1104
01:18:46,529 --> 01:18:49,555
<i>I could have danced all night</i>

1105
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:53,289
<i>I could have danced all night</i>

1106
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:57,898
<i>And still have begged for more</i>

1107
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,567
<i>I could have spread my wings</i>

1108
01:19:02,879 --> 01:19:05,803
<i>And done a thousand things</i>

1109
01:19:06,316 --> 01:19:10,844
<i>I've never done before</i>

1110
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:17,650
<i>I'll never know what made it so exciting</i>

1111
01:19:19,462 --> 01:19:24,126
<i>Why all at once my heart took flight</i>

1112
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:30,795
<i>I only know when he</i>

1113
01:19:31,474 --> 01:19:34,466
<i>Began to dance with me</i>

1114
01:19:34,844 --> 01:19:39,167
<i>I could have danced, danced, danced</i>

1115
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:43,446
<i>all night!</i>

1116
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:46,876
It's all been grand, dear.

1117
01:19:47,223 --> 01:19:50,215
But now it's time to sleep!

1118
01:19:57,467 --> 01:20:00,800
<i>I could have danced all night</i>

1119
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,901
<i>I could have danced all night</i>

1120
01:20:04,307 --> 01:20:08,971
<i>And still have begged for more</i>

1121
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:14,142
<i>I could have spread my wings</i>

1122
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:17,511
<i>And done a thousand things</i>

1123
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:22,549
<i>I've never done before</i>

1124
01:20:24,494 --> 01:20:29,522
<i>I'll never know what made it so exciting</i>

1125
01:20:31,234 --> 01:20:35,898
<i>Why all at once my heart took flight</i>

1126
01:20:37,173 --> 01:20:41,837
<i>I only know when he</i>

1127
01:20:42,579 --> 01:20:45,605
<i>Began to dance with me</i>

1128
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:50,546
<i>I could have danced, danced, danced</i>

1129
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,682
<i>all night!</i>

1130
01:21:36,599 --> 01:21:40,592
<i>Every duke and earl and peer is here</i>

1131
01:21:40,703 --> 01:21:44,366
<i>Everyone who should be here is here</i>

1132
01:21:44,507 --> 01:21:47,499
<i>What a smashing, positively dashing</i>

1133
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:51,540
<i>Spectacle, the Ascot opening day</i>

1134
01:21:52,415 --> 01:21:55,646
<i>At the gate are all the horses</i>

1135
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:59,778
<i>Waiting for the cue to fly away</i>

1136
01:22:00,356 --> 01:22:03,416
<i>What a gripping, absolutely ripping</i>

1137
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:07,448
<i>Moment at the Ascot opening day</i>

1138
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:11,695
<i>Pulses rushing</i>

1139
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,635
<i>Faces flushing</i>

1140
01:22:16,206 --> 01:22:19,630
<i>Heartbeats speed up</i>

1141
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,203
<i>I have never been so keyed up!</i>

1142
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:26,205
<i>Any second now</i>

1143
01:22:26,282 --> 01:22:28,045
<i>They'll begin to run</i>

1144
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:29,913
<i>Hark! A bell is ringing</i>

1145
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,477
<i>They are springing forward, look!</i>

1146
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:35,549
<i>It has begun</i>

1147
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:05,344
<i>What a frenzied moment that was</i>

1148
01:23:05,488 --> 01:23:09,379
<i>Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace?</i>

1149
01:23:10,093 --> 01:23:13,358
<i>It was a thrilling, absolutely chilling</i>

1150
01:23:13,563 --> 01:23:17,294
<i>Running of the Ascot opening race!</i>

1151
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:47,149
Mother!

1152
01:24:49,025 --> 01:24:51,118
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

1153
01:24:51,194 --> 01:24:52,286
Hello, Mother.

1154
01:24:52,929 --> 01:24:54,089
How nice you look.

1155
01:24:54,163 --> 01:24:57,519
What are you doing here? You promised never to come to Ascot Go home.

1156
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,158
I can' t I'm here on business.

1157
01:24:59,235 --> 01:25:02,090
No, you mus I'm quite serious You ofend all my friends

1158
01:25:02,171 --> 01:25:04,537
The moment they meet you I never see them again.

1159
01:25:04,707 --> 01:25:06,299
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot

1160
01:25:06,376 --> 01:25:08,936
I changed my shirt Mother, I've got a job for you.

1161
01:25:09,012 --> 01:25:11,310
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1162
01:25:12,348 --> 01:25:14,646
Oh, no, not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1163
01:25:14,717 --> 01:25:18,175
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball but I wanted to try her out firs

1164
01:25:18,254 --> 01:25:20,882
- I beg your pardon? - Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1165
01:25:21,891 --> 01:25:24,519
So I invited her to your box today, do you understand?

1166
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:26,351
Common flower girl?

1167
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:28,452
Itaught her how to speak properly.

1168
01:25:28,531 --> 01:25:30,829
She has strict instructions as to her behavior.

1169
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:34,028
She's to keep to two subjects: The weather and everybody's health.

1170
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:37,567
"Fine day!" and "How do you do?" Not just let herself go on things in general.

1171
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,699
Help her along, darling. You'll be quite safe.

1172
01:25:39,776 --> 01:25:42,006
Safe? To talk about one's health in the middle of a race?

1173
01:25:42,078 --> 01:25:44,137
Well, she's got to talk about something.

1174
01:25:44,213 --> 01:25:45,441
Where is the girl now?

1175
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:48,575
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes we bought her didn't quite fit.

1176
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:51,176
Itold Pickering we should have taken her with us

1177
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:57,687
- Mrs Eynsford-Hill. - Good afternoon, Mrs Higgins

1178
01:25:58,728 --> 01:26:00,389
You know my son, Henry.

1179
01:26:00,463 --> 01:26:01,452
How do you do?

1180
01:26:02,298 --> 01:26:04,630
- I've seen you somewhere before. - I don't know.

1181
01:26:04,767 --> 01:26:07,065
It doesn 't matter. You better sit down.

1182
01:26:10,807 --> 01:26:12,468
Where the devil can they be?

1183
01:26:47,677 --> 01:26:49,907
Colonel Pickering, you're just in time for tea

1184
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:53,244
Thank you, Mrs Higgins May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1185
01:26:53,349 --> 01:26:54,714
My dear, Miss Doolittle.

1186
01:26:54,784 --> 01:26:57,514
How kind of you to let me come.

1187
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:58,918
Delighted, my dear.

1188
01:27:00,022 --> 01:27:02,013
- Lady Boxington. - How do you do?

1189
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:05,992
- Lord Boxington. - How do you do?

1190
01:27:06,062 --> 01:27:07,017
How do you do?

1191
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:10,020
- Mrs Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle. - How do you do?

1192
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,589
How do you do?

1193
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:13,699
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1194
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:16,429
How do you do?

1195
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:20,333
How do you do?

1196
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,202
Miss Doolittle.

1197
01:27:22,645 --> 01:27:25,808
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins

1198
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:37,686
The first race was very exciting, Miss Doolittle.

1199
01:27:37,827 --> 01:27:40,057
I'm so sorry that you missed it

1200
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:41,923
Will it rain, do you think?

1201
01:27:42,398 --> 01:27:46,494
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.

1202
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:56,135
But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1203
01:27:57,513 --> 01:27:58,946
How awfully funny.

1204
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:02,572
What is wrong with that, young man? I bet I got it right

1205
01:28:02,885 --> 01:28:03,817
Smashing.

1206
01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:06,744
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1207
01:28:07,223 --> 01:28:10,579
I do hope we won't have any unseasonable cold spells

1208
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,851
They bring on so much influenza

1209
01:28:12,929 --> 01:28:15,659
And the whole of our family is susceptible to it

1210
01:28:15,765 --> 01:28:20,088
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1211
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:24,458
But it's my belief they done the old woman in.

1212
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:26,972
Done her in?

1213
01:28:27,577 --> 01:28:29,272
Yes, Lord love you.

1214
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:31,775
Why should she die of influenza...

1215
01:28:32,048 --> 01:28:35,540
when she come through diphtheria right enough the year before.

1216
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:38,315
Fairly blue with it she was.

1217
01:28:38,988 --> 01:28:40,819
They all thought she was dead.

1218
01:28:40,923 --> 01:28:45,053
But my father, he kept ladling gin down her throat.

1219
01:28:50,032 --> 01:28:54,389
Then she come to so sudden she bit the bowl of the spoon.

1220
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:57,195
Dear me!

1221
01:28:58,341 --> 01:29:01,674
Now what call would a woman with that strength in her...

1222
01:29:01,744 --> 01:29:03,405
have to die of influenza

1223
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,646
And what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?

1224
01:29:11,254 --> 01:29:13,586
Somebody pinched it

1225
01:29:14,824 --> 01:29:16,621
And what I say is

1226
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:19,783
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1227
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:23,588
Done her in? Done her in, did you say?

1228
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,961
Whatever does it mea

1229
01:29:26,102 --> 01:29:30,664
Oh, that 's the new small talk. "To do somebody in" means to kill them.

1230
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:34,434
But you surely don't believe your aunt was killed?

1231
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:36,308
Do I not

1232
01:29:36,445 --> 01:29:41,439
Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1233
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:44,342
But it can' t have been right for your father...

1234
01:29:44,387 --> 01:29:47,220
to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1235
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,217
It might have killed her.

1236
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:53,113
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1237
01:29:53,496 --> 01:29:58,627
Besides, he poured so much down his own throat he knew the good of it

1238
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:00,926
Do you mean that he drank?

1239
01:30:01,203 --> 01:30:04,036
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1240
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:10,971
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1241
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:14,775
The new small talk. You do it so awfully well.

1242
01:30:14,984 --> 01:30:18,647
Well, if I was doing it proper, what was you sniggering at?

1243
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:21,920
Have I said anything I oughtn 't

1244
01:30:23,826 --> 01:30:25,384
Not at all, my dear.

1245
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:27,789
Well, that 's a mercy anyhow.

1246
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,928
I don't know if there's enough time before the next race to place a bet...

1247
01:30:34,003 --> 01:30:35,834
but come, my dear.

1248
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:40,034
I have a bet on number seven. Ishould be so happy if you would take it

1249
01:30:40,176 --> 01:30:42,269
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1250
01:30:42,378 --> 01:30:43,902
That 's very kind of you.

1251
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,206
His name is Dover.

1252
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:46,679
Come along, Eliza

1253
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:52,141
<i>There they are again</i>

1254
01:30:52,221 --> 01:30:53,848
<i>Lining up to run</i>

1255
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:56,052
<i>Now they're holding steady</i>

1256
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:58,389
<i>They are ready for it, look</i>

1257
01:30:59,462 --> 01:31:01,692
<i>It has begun</i>

1258
01:31:07,603 --> 01:31:09,400
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1259
01:31:10,373 --> 01:31:11,362
Come on.

1260
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,266
Come on, Dover!

1261
01:31:13,409 --> 01:31:14,364
Come on!

1262
01:31:18,814 --> 01:31:22,944
Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' ass

1263
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:30,857
Oh, my dear.

1264
01:31:45,808 --> 01:31:49,505
You're not serious, Henry. You don't expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1265
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:51,337
Don't you think she's ready for it

1266
01:31:51,414 --> 01:31:53,746
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1267
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:56,147
Her language may need a little refining, but- -

1268
01:31:56,218 --> 01:31:59,847
Really, Henry, if you cannot see how impossible this whole project is...

1269
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:01,810
then you must be absolutely potty about her.

1270
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,779
Ladvise you to give it up and not put yourself...

1271
01:32:03,859 --> 01:32:05,224
or this poor girl through any more.

1272
01:32:05,294 --> 01:32:08,058
Why, it's the most fascinating venture I've ever undertaken.

1273
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,395
Pickering and I are at it from morning till night It fills our whole lives

1274
01:32:11,467 --> 01:32:15,358
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza, listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza

1275
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:20,266
You're a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.

1276
01:32:20,342 --> 01:32:21,536
Here's the car.

1277
01:33:42,858 --> 01:33:43,916
Good evening, sir.

1278
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:46,553
- Is dinner ready? I'm famished. - Immediately, sir.

1279
01:33:46,762 --> 01:33:48,559
Good evening, Professor Higgins

1280
01:34:06,448 --> 01:34:10,646
<i>When she mentioned</i> <i>How her aunt bit off the spoon</i>

1281
01:34:11,387 --> 01:34:14,686
<i>She completely done me in</i>

1282
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:18,547
<i>And my heart went on</i> <i>A journey to the moon</i>

1283
01:34:19,161 --> 01:34:23,791
<i>When she told about her father</i> <i>And the gin</i>

1284
01:34:24,466 --> 01:34:28,459
<i>And I never saw</i> <i>A more enchanting farce</i>

1285
01:34:29,171 --> 01:34:34,097
<i>Than the moment when she shouted</i> <i>"Move your bloomin"...</i>

1286
01:34:34,843 --> 01:34:36,242
- Yes, sir? - Is Miss Doolittle in?

1287
01:34:36,979 --> 01:34:38,469
Whom shall I say is calling?

1288
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:41,907
Freddy Eynsford-Hill. If she doesn 't remember who I am...

1289
01:34:42,284 --> 01:34:44,946
tell her I'm the chap who was sniggering at her.

1290
01:34:45,321 --> 01:34:46,310
Yes, sir.

1291
01:34:46,388 --> 01:34:48,185
And will you give her these?

1292
01:34:48,757 --> 01:34:50,190
Wouldn't you like to come in, sir?

1293
01:34:50,259 --> 01:34:51,988
They're having dinner, but you may wait in the hall.

1294
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:55,224
No, thank you. I want to drink in the street where she lives

1295
01:35:04,173 --> 01:35:09,099
<i>I have often walked</i> <i>Down this street before</i>

1296
01:35:09,945 --> 01:35:14,837
<i>But the pavement always stayed</i> <i>Beneath my feet before</i>

1297
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:20,544
<i>All at once am I <i>Several stories high</i>

1298
01:35:21,223 --> 01:35:25,853
<i>Knowing I'm on the street</i> <i>Where you live</i>

1299
01:35:27,129 --> 01:35:32,089
<i>Are there lilac trees</i> <i>In the heart of town?</i>

1300
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:37,761
<i>Can you hear a lark</i> <i>In any other part of town?</i>

1301
01:35:38,674 --> 01:35:43,532
<i>Does enchantment pour</i> <i>Out of every door?</i>

1302
01:35:44,313 --> 01:35:48,977
<i>No, it's just on the street</i> <i>Where you live</i>

1303
01:35:50,519 --> 01:35:55,047
<i>And, oh, the towering feeling</i>

1304
01:35:55,891 --> 01:36:00,385
<i>Just to know</i> <i>Somehow you are near</i>

1305
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:06,625
<i>The overpowering feeling</i>

1306
01:36:07,169 --> 01:36:11,833
<i>That any second</i> <i>You may suddenly appear</i>

1307
01:36:13,409 --> 01:36:18,164
<i>People stop and stare</i> <i>They don't bother me</i>

1308
01:36:19,181 --> 01:36:23,845
<i>For there's nowhere else on Earth</i> <i>That I would rather be</i>

1309
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,146
<i>Let the time go by</i>

1310
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:32,283
<i>I won't care if I

1311
01:36:33,028 --> 01:36:37,692
<i>Can be here on the street</i> <i>Where you live</i>

1312
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,962
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1313
01:36:47,109 --> 01:36:50,237
Miss Doolittle says she doesn 't want to see anyone ever again.

1314
01:36:50,312 --> 01:36:51,973
But why? She was unbelievable.

1315
01:36:52,081 --> 01:36:55,244
So I've been told, sir. Is there any further message?

1316
01:36:56,452 --> 01:36:57,714
Tell her that I'll wait

1317
01:36:57,786 --> 01:37:00,209
Oh, but it might be days, sir, even weeks

1318
01:37:00,289 --> 01:37:02,712
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1319
01:37:11,734 --> 01:37:16,398
<i>People stop and stare</i> <i>They don't bother me</i>

1320
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:22,404
<i>For there's nowhere else on Earth</i> <i>That I would rather be</i>

1321
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:26,468
<i>Let the time go by</i>

1322
01:37:27,149 --> 01:37:31,472
<i>I won't care if I

1323
01:37:32,421 --> 01:37:37,085
<i>Can be here on the street</i> <i>Where you live</i>

1324
01:37:47,269 --> 01:37:50,033
It really is, Higgins It's inhuman to continue.

1325
01:37:50,305 --> 01:37:53,035
Do you realize what you've got to try and teach this poor girl in six <i>weeks</i>

1326
01:37:53,108 --> 01:37:55,906
You've got to teach her to walk, talk, address a duke, a lord...

1327
01:37:55,978 --> 01:37:58,708
a bishop, an ambassador. It's absolutely impossible.

1328
01:37:58,947 --> 01:38:02,508
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you that I want to call of the bet

1329
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:04,848
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.

1330
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,842
This experiment is over.

1331
01:38:06,922 --> 01:38:11,245
And nothing short of an order from the King could force me to recant.

1332
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,628
You understand, <i>Higgins</i> It's over.

1333
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:20,061
Higgins, if there's any mishap at the Embassy tonight...

1334
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:22,897
if Miss Doolittle sufers any embarrassment whatever...

1335
01:38:22,971 --> 01:38:24,233
it'll be on your head alone.

1336
01:38:24,306 --> 01:38:25,568
<i>Eliza can do anything.

1337
01:38:25,641 --> 01:38:27,233
Suppose she's discovered? Remember Ascot

1338
01:38:27,309 --> 01:38:29,197
Suppose she makes another ghastly mistake?

1339
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,940
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1340
01:38:34,216 --> 01:38:36,514
Think of how agonizing it would be.

1341
01:38:36,585 --> 01:38:39,247
If anything happened tonight, I don't know what I'd do.

1342
01:38:39,321 --> 01:38:40,913
You could always rejoin your regiment

1343
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:42,854
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins

1344
01:38:42,925 --> 01:38:44,790
The way you've driven her the last six weeks...

1345
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,158
has exceeded all bounds of common decency.

1346
01:38:47,229 --> 01:38:50,221
For God's sake, stop pacing up and down. Can' t you settle somewhere?

1347
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:52,255
Have some port lt'll quieten your nerves

1348
01:38:52,334 --> 01:38:53,665
I'm not nervous

1349
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:57,226
- Where is it - On the piano.

1350
01:38:58,774 --> 01:39:00,105
The car 's here, sir.

1351
01:39:00,175 --> 01:39:01,870
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle, will you?

1352
01:39:01,944 --> 01:39:05,436
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed. I'll bet you that damned gown doesn 't fit.

1353
01:39:05,647 --> 01:39:07,945
I warned you about these French designers

1354
01:39:08,016 --> 01:39:10,974
We should have gone to <i>an</i> English shop. They would've been on our side.

1355
01:39:11,053 --> 01:39:13,146
- Have a glass of port - No, thank you.

1356
01:39:19,928 --> 01:39:24,126
Are you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?

1357
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:26,361
Well, we shall see.

1358
01:39:26,735 --> 01:39:28,066
Suppose she doesn 't

1359
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,029
I lose my bet

1360
01:39:31,206 --> 01:39:34,903
There's one thing I can' t stand about you, that 's your confounded complacency.

1361
01:39:34,977 --> 01:39:36,842
At a moment like this, with so much at stake...

1362
01:39:36,912 --> 01:39:39,904
it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of port

1363
01:39:42,284 --> 01:39:45,811
And what about the girl? You act as though she doesn 't matter at all.

1364
01:39:46,121 --> 01:39:48,715
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters

1365
01:39:49,124 --> 01:39:51,547
What do you think I've been doing all these <i>months</i>

1366
01:39:51,627 --> 01:39:54,790
What could possibly matter more than to take a human being...

1367
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:59,088
and change her into a diferent human being by creating a new speech for her?

1368
01:39:59,501 --> 01:40:03,267
It's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class...

1369
01:40:03,405 --> 01:40:04,997
and soul from soul.

1370
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:08,069
Oh, she matters immensely.

1371
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:32,689
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1372
01:40:33,368 --> 01:40:34,960
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1373
01:40:35,037 --> 01:40:36,595
Don't you think so, <i>Higgins</i>

1374
01:40:39,675 --> 01:40:42,337
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1375
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:45,191
Maestro! Maestro!

1376
01:43:47,405 --> 01:43:48,599
Don't you remember me?

1377
01:43:48,673 --> 01:43:50,300
No. Who the devil are you?

1378
01:43:50,374 --> 01:43:53,730
I'm your pupil. Your firs your greates your best pupil.

1379
01:43:53,945 --> 01:43:56,277
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1380
01:43:57,815 --> 01:43:59,578
Imade your name famous throughout Europe.

1381
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,606
You teach me phonetics You cannot forget me.

1382
01:44:01,686 --> 01:44:03,449
Why don't you have your hair cut

1383
01:44:03,521 --> 01:44:07,048
I don't have your imposing appearance, your figure, your brow.

1384
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:09,216
If I had my hair cut, nobody would notice me.

1385
01:44:09,293 --> 01:44:11,158
Where did you get all of these old <i>coins</i>

1386
01:44:11,229 --> 01:44:13,220
These are decorations for languages

1387
01:44:13,297 --> 01:44:15,060
The Queen of Transylvania is here this evening.

1388
01:44:15,132 --> 01:44:17,828
I'm indispensable to her at these oficial international parties

1389
01:44:17,902 --> 01:44:21,235
Ispeak 32 languages I know everyone in Europe.

1390
01:44:21,372 --> 01:44:23,465
No imposter can escape my detection.

1391
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:25,532
Professor Karpathy.

1392
01:44:27,725 --> 01:44:29,249
The Greek ambassador.

1393
01:44:30,027 --> 01:44:31,187
Greek, my foot

1394
01:44:31,428 --> 01:44:34,022
He pretends not to know any English, but he cannot deceive me.

1395
01:44:34,098 --> 01:44:36,293
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1396
01:44:37,234 --> 01:44:40,658
He speaks English so villainously that he cannot utter a word...

1397
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:43,002
without betraying his origin.

1398
01:44:43,073 --> 01:44:46,600
I help him pretend, but I make him pay through the nose. I make them all pay.

1399
01:44:46,677 --> 01:44:49,737
<i>Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs Her Excellency asked for you.

1400
01:45:09,967 --> 01:45:11,958
<i>Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.</i>

1401
01:45:15,372 --> 01:45:18,227
<i>Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.</i>

1402
01:45:19,943 --> 01:45:22,776
<i>Sir Guy and Lady Scot Auckland.</i>

1403
01:45:42,633 --> 01:45:44,794
<i>The Count and Countess Demereau.</i>

1404
01:45:45,536 --> 01:45:48,027
<i>The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.</i>

1405
01:45:48,205 --> 01:45:51,060
<i>Mr. And Mrs. Richard Lanser.</i>

1406
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:54,302
<i>Lord and Lady Clanders.</i>

1407
01:45:54,978 --> 01:45:57,867
Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

1408
01:45:58,215 --> 01:46:01,776
<i>Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.</i>

1409
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:04,210
<i>Professor Higgins.</i>

1410
01:46:04,688 --> 01:46:06,679
- Your Excellency. - Miss Doolittle.

1411
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:08,187
How do you do?

1412
01:46:08,258 --> 01:46:10,556
- Good evening, Colonel. - Good evening.

1413
01:46:11,962 --> 01:46:14,988
What an enchanting young lady you have with you this evening.

1414
01:46:15,399 --> 01:46:16,730
Well, who is she?

1415
01:46:17,167 --> 01:46:20,898
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins <i>Excuse me.

1416
01:46:21,238 --> 01:46:22,330
Professor Higgins

1417
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,735
Such a faraway look, as if she's always lived in a garden.

1418
01:46:27,044 --> 01:46:29,205
So she has. A sort of garden.

1419
01:46:58,108 --> 01:47:01,566
Henry must take Eliza home at once. There's a language expert here.

1420
01:47:01,645 --> 01:47:04,808
- Sort of you know, imposterologis - I beg you pardon?

1421
01:47:05,582 --> 01:47:07,607
The young lady with Colonel Pickering...

1422
01:47:08,252 --> 01:47:09,810
Find out who she is

1423
01:47:10,053 --> 01:47:11,213
With pleasure.

1424
01:47:11,788 --> 01:47:13,949
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1425
01:47:20,097 --> 01:47:22,691
Tell me, Zoltan, some more about the Greek ambassador.

1426
01:47:22,766 --> 01:47:26,327
Gladly, but first I would love you to present me to this glorious creature.

1427
01:47:26,403 --> 01:47:28,234
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1428
01:47:37,481 --> 01:47:40,314
<i>Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...</i>

1429
01:47:40,584 --> 01:47:43,747
<i>and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.</i>

1430
01:48:29,866 --> 01:48:32,357
Charming. Quite charming.

1431
01:48:33,704 --> 01:48:35,467
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1432
01:50:11,568 --> 01:50:14,230
Miss Doolittle, my son would like to dance with you.

1433
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,831
Absolutely fantastic.

1434
01:53:26,305 --> 01:53:27,636
A lot of tomfoolery.

1435
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,865
It was an immense achievement

1436
01:53:29,942 --> 01:53:31,204
Well, Mr. <i>Higgins</i>

1437
01:53:31,877 --> 01:53:35,005
Atriumph, Mrs Pearce. A total triumph.

1438
01:53:35,281 --> 01:53:38,739
Higgins, you were superb, absolutely superb.

1439
01:53:38,985 --> 01:53:42,614
Tell us the truth now, weren't you a little bit nervous once or twice?

1440
01:53:43,055 --> 01:53:44,818
Not during the whole evening?

1441
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:46,585
Not when I saw we were going to win.

1442
01:53:46,659 --> 01:53:48,456
Lfelt like a bear in a cage hanging about

1443
01:53:48,527 --> 01:53:50,415
It was an immense achievement

1444
01:53:50,496 --> 01:53:53,158
If I hadn't backed myself to do it, I'd have given it up two months ago.

1445
01:53:53,232 --> 01:53:54,961
Absolutely fantastic.

1446
01:53:55,067 --> 01:53:56,591
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1447
01:53:56,702 --> 01:53:58,658
Higgins, I salute you.

1448
01:53:58,738 --> 01:54:01,502
The silly people don't know their own silly business.

1449
01:54:01,574 --> 01:54:04,566
<i>Tonight, old man, you did it</i> <i>You did it, you did it</i>

1450
01:54:04,744 --> 01:54:07,440
<i>You said that you would do it</i> <i>And indeed you did</i>

1451
01:54:07,713 --> 01:54:10,546
<i>I thought that you would rue it</i> <i>I doubted you'd do it</i>

1452
01:54:10,783 --> 01:54:13,741
<i>But now I must admit it</i> <i>That succeed you did</i>

1453
01:54:13,953 --> 01:54:16,444
<i>You should get a medal</i> <i>Or be even made a knight</i>

1454
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:19,317
<i>Oh, it was nothing, really nothing</i>

1455
01:54:20,059 --> 01:54:22,789
<i>All alone you hurdled</i> <i>Every obstacle in sight</i>

1456
01:54:23,062 --> 01:54:26,225
<i>Now wait, now wait</i> <i>Give credit where it's due</i>

1457
01:54:26,332 --> 01:54:28,857
<i>A lot of the glory goes to you</i>

1458
01:54:29,568 --> 01:54:32,492
<i>But you're the one who did it</i> <i>Who did it, who did it</i>

1459
01:54:32,672 --> 01:54:35,561
<i>As sturdy as Gibraltar</i> <i>Not a second did you falter</i>

1460
01:54:35,675 --> 01:54:37,006
<i>There's no doubt about it</i>

1461
01:54:37,076 --> 01:54:40,341
<i>You did it!</i>

1462
01:54:43,582 --> 01:54:47,712
<i>I must have aged a year tonight</i> <i>At times I thought I'd die of fright</i>

1463
01:54:47,953 --> 01:54:50,649
<i>Never was there a momentary lull</i>

1464
01:54:51,824 --> 01:54:55,817
<i>Shortly after we came in</i> <i>I saw at once we'd easily win</i>

1465
01:54:55,961 --> 01:54:58,691
<i>And after that I found it deadly dull</i>

1466
01:54:59,999 --> 01:55:02,229
<i>You should have heard</i> <i>The "oohs"and "aahs"</i>

1467
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:04,166
<i>Everyone wondering who she was</i>

1468
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:07,032
<i>You'd think they'd never seen</i> <i>A lady before</i>

1469
01:55:07,773 --> 01:55:12,096
<i>And when the Prince of Transylvania</i> <i>Asked to meet her</i>

1470
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:16,571
<i>And gave his arm</i> <i>To lead her to the floor</i>

1471
01:55:18,117 --> 01:55:21,382
<i>I said to him: "You did it</i> <i>You did it, you did it"</i>

1472
01:55:21,487 --> 01:55:24,615
<i>They thought she was ecstatic</i> <i>And so damned aristocratic</i>

1473
01:55:24,724 --> 01:55:27,215
<i>And they never knew</i> <i>That you</i>

1474
01:55:29,228 --> 01:55:30,422
<i>did it</i>

1475
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:34,519
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1476
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,830
If it hadn't been for him I would've died of boredom.

1477
01:55:36,902 --> 01:55:39,200
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungaria Was he there?

1478
01:55:39,271 --> 01:55:42,126
Yes, he was there all right and up to his old tricks

1479
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:45,032
<i>That blackguard</i> <i>Who uses the science of speech</i>

1480
01:55:45,111 --> 01:55:47,375
<i>More to blackmail and swindle than teach</i>

1481
01:55:48,214 --> 01:55:50,637
<i>He made it the devilish business of his</i>

1482
01:55:51,016 --> 01:55:54,008
<i>To find out who this Miss Doolittle is</i>

1483
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:57,511
<i>Every time we looked around</i> <i>There he was</i>

1484
01:55:57,590 --> 01:55:59,785
<i>That hairy hound from Budapest</i>

1485
01:56:01,761 --> 01:56:04,787
<i>Never leaving us alone</i> <i>Never have I ever known</i>

1486
01:56:04,864 --> 01:56:06,161
<i>A ruder pest</i>

1487
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,366
<i>Finally I decided it was foolish</i> <i>Not to let him have his chance with her</i>

1488
01:56:14,406 --> 01:56:18,399
<i>So I stepped aside</i> <i>And let him dance with her</i>

1489
01:56:20,179 --> 01:56:25,310
<i>Oozing charm from every pore</i> <i>He oiled his way around the floor</i>

1490
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:29,974
<i>Every trick that he could play</i> <i>He used to strip her mask away</i>

1491
01:56:30,422 --> 01:56:34,518
<i>And when at last the dance was done</i> <i>He glowed as if he knew he'd won</i>

1492
01:56:35,327 --> 01:56:38,455
<i>And with a voice too eager</i> <i>And a smile too broad</i>

1493
01:56:38,931 --> 01:56:42,458
<i>He announced to the hostess</i> <i>That she was a fraud</i>

1494
01:56:43,369 --> 01:56:44,666
No!

1495
01:56:50,109 --> 01:56:54,341
<i>"Her English is too good,"he said</i> <i>"That clearly indicates that she is foreign</i>

1496
01:56:56,615 --> 01:56:59,413
<i>"Whereas others are instructed</i> <i>In their native language</i>

1497
01:56:59,518 --> 01:57:01,281
<i>"English people aren't</i>

1498
01:57:02,955 --> 01:57:07,619
<i>"And although she may have studied with</i> <i>An expert dialectician and grammarian</i>

1499
01:57:09,795 --> 01:57:14,459
<i>"I can tell that she was born</i>

1500
01:57:15,467 --> 01:57:16,866
<i>"Hungarian"</i>

1501
01:57:18,737 --> 01:57:21,228
<i>Not only Hungarian but of royal blood</i>

1502
01:57:22,308 --> 01:57:24,299
<i>She is a princess</i>

1503
01:57:24,677 --> 01:57:28,465
<i>"Her blood,"he said</i> <i>"Is bluer than the Danube is or ever was</i>

1504
01:57:28,614 --> 01:57:31,572
<i>"Royalty is absolutely written on her face</i>

1505
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:34,710
<i>"She thought I was taken in</i> <i>But actually I never was</i>

1506
01:57:34,854 --> 01:57:37,516
<i>"How could she deceive</i> <i>Another member of her race?</i>

1507
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:42,747
<i>"I know each language on the map"</i> <i>Said he</i>

1508
01:57:42,995 --> 01:57:47,284
<i>"And she's Hungarian</i> <i>As the first Hungarian Rhapsody"</i>

1509
01:57:55,307 --> 01:57:59,129
<i>Congratulations, Professor Higgins</i>

1510
01:57:59,545 --> 01:58:03,003
<i>For your glorious victory</i>

1511
01:58:03,282 --> 01:58:07,048
<i>Congratulations, Professor Higgins</i>

1512
01:58:07,453 --> 01:58:10,911
<i>You'll be mentioned in history</i>

1513
01:58:33,612 --> 01:58:35,807
Well, thank God, that 's over.

1514
01:58:36,348 --> 01:58:38,839
Now I can go to bed without dreading tomorrow.

1515
01:58:41,487 --> 01:58:43,819
- Good night, Mr. Higgins - Good night, Mrs Pearce.

1516
01:58:43,889 --> 01:58:47,780
Ithink I'll turn in, too. Good night, Higgins It's been a great occasion.

1517
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,293
Good night, Pickering.

1518
01:58:50,396 --> 01:58:51,727
Mrs Pearce?

1519
01:58:52,665 --> 01:58:56,863
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me cofee in the morning instead of tea

1520
01:58:57,503 --> 01:59:00,893
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza And put out the lights.

1521
01:59:49,088 --> 01:59:51,682
Must be downstairs Oh, darn it

1522
01:59:52,057 --> 01:59:53,888
I'll leave my head behind one of these days

1523
01:59:53,959 --> 01:59:56,154
What the devil have I done with my <i>slippers</i>

1524
01:59:59,331 --> 02:00:00,923
Here are your slippers

1525
02:00:06,305 --> 02:00:10,093
Take your slippers and may you never have a day 's luck with them.

1526
02:00:10,843 --> 02:00:12,640
What on Earth? What 's the matter?

1527
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:14,572
Is anything wrong?

1528
02:00:14,713 --> 02:00:17,671
No, nothing's wrong with you. I won your bet for you, haven't I?

1529
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:20,446
That 's enough for you! I don't matter, I suppose?

1530
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:24,849
You won my bet You presumptuous insect I won it

1531
02:00:24,923 --> 02:00:26,584
Why did you throw those slippers at me?

1532
02:00:26,658 --> 02:00:29,957
Because I wanted to smash your face. I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1533
02:00:30,029 --> 02:00:32,395
Why didn't you leave me where you picked me up, the gutter?

1534
02:00:32,464 --> 02:00:36,127
You thank God it's all over. Now you ca throw me back again! Do you?

1535
02:00:36,335 --> 02:00:38,929
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1536
02:00:42,408 --> 02:00:44,774
Claws in, you cat! How dare you show your temper to me?

1537
02:00:44,843 --> 02:00:46,435
Sit down and be quiet

1538
02:00:46,512 --> 02:00:50,209
Oh, what 's to become of me? What 's to become of me?

1539
02:00:52,317 --> 02:00:54,273
How the devil do I know what 's to become of you?

1540
02:00:54,353 --> 02:00:55,547
What does it matter?

1541
02:00:55,621 --> 02:00:58,476
You don't care. I know you don't care.

1542
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,885
You wouldn't care if I was dead. I'm nothing to you.

1543
02:01:00,959 --> 02:01:02,847
Not as much as them slippers

1544
02:01:02,928 --> 02:01:04,020
Those slippers

1545
02:01:04,096 --> 02:01:07,759
Those slippers I didn't think it meant any diference now.

1546
02:01:11,136 --> 02:01:13,559
Why have you suddenly begun going on like <i>this</i>

1547
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,730
May I ask if you complain of your treatment here?

1548
02:01:17,743 --> 02:01:20,906
Has anybody behaved badly? Colonel Pickering, Mrs Pearce?

1549
02:01:22,514 --> 02:01:25,403
Well you don't pretend that I have treated you badly?

1550
02:01:27,286 --> 02:01:29,151
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1551
02:01:30,422 --> 02:01:33,277
Perhaps you're tired after the strain of the day.

1552
02:01:33,959 --> 02:01:36,325
Would you have a chocolate?

1553
02:01:36,662 --> 02:01:39,153
No, thank you.

1554
02:01:41,366 --> 02:01:44,893
Well, it's only natural that you should be anxious, but it's all over now.

1555
02:01:45,437 --> 02:01:47,166
Nothing more to worry about

1556
02:01:47,406 --> 02:01:50,261
No, nothing more for you to worry about

1557
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:54,306
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1558
02:01:54,947 --> 02:01:57,507
Why? In heaven's name, why?

1559
02:01:58,383 --> 02:02:02,012
Now listen to me, Eliza All this irritation is purely subjective.

1560
02:02:02,488 --> 02:02:04,752
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1561
02:02:04,823 --> 02:02:08,054
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong. Nobody's hurting you.

1562
02:02:08,427 --> 02:02:09,655
Go to bed and sleep it of.

1563
02:02:09,728 --> 02:02:14,153
Have a little cry and say your prayers You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1564
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,331
I heard your prayers

1565
02:02:16,502 --> 02:02:18,265
"Thank God it's all over."

1566
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:20,099
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1567
02:02:20,172 --> 02:02:22,470
Now you're free, and you can do what you like.

1568
02:02:22,674 --> 02:02:25,802
Oh, what am I fit for? What have you left me fit for?

1569
02:02:26,512 --> 02:02:29,276
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1570
02:02:29,915 --> 02:02:31,974
And what 's to become of me?

1571
02:02:33,085 --> 02:02:35,918
Oh, that 's what 's worrying you, is it

1572
02:02:37,523 --> 02:02:39,479
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1573
02:02:39,558 --> 02:02:43,722
I'm sure you won't have any dificulty in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1574
02:02:46,732 --> 02:02:48,893
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1575
02:02:50,435 --> 02:02:52,357
You might marry, you know.

1576
02:02:52,771 --> 02:02:56,628
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1577
02:02:56,775 --> 02:02:59,767
Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils

1578
02:03:00,512 --> 02:03:01,501
You're not bad -Iooking.

1579
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:04,242
You're really quite a pleasure to look at sometimes

1580
02:03:04,383 --> 02:03:05,748
Not now, when you've been crying.

1581
02:03:05,817 --> 02:03:07,614
You look like the very devil, but...

1582
02:03:07,686 --> 02:03:12,146
when you're all right and quite yourself you're what I would call attractive.

1583
02:03:14,059 --> 02:03:16,425
Go to bed, have a good night's res get up in the morning...

1584
02:03:16,495 --> 02:03:19,726
and have a look at yourself in the glass You won't feel so bad.

1585
02:03:24,736 --> 02:03:28,331
I daresay, my mother might find some fellow or other who would do very well.

1586
02:03:28,674 --> 02:03:30,767
We were above that in Covent Garden.

1587
02:03:30,876 --> 02:03:32,366
What do you mea

1588
02:03:32,544 --> 02:03:35,069
Isold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1589
02:03:35,847 --> 02:03:38,975
Now you've made a lady of me, I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1590
02:03:39,051 --> 02:03:41,713
Oh, tosh, Eliza Don't insult human relations...

1591
02:03:41,787 --> 02:03:44,847
by dragging all that cant about buying and selling into it

1592
02:03:44,923 --> 02:03:47,016
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1593
02:03:47,092 --> 02:03:48,719
What else am I to do?

1594
02:03:48,794 --> 02:03:50,659
Oh, there are lots of things

1595
02:03:50,729 --> 02:03:53,118
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1596
02:03:53,232 --> 02:03:56,292
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one. He's got lots of money.

1597
02:03:56,368 --> 02:03:57,926
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1598
02:03:58,003 --> 02:04:02,497
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll make a big hole in 200 pounds

1599
02:04:02,708 --> 02:04:05,006
Oh, come on now. You'll be all right

1600
02:04:06,245 --> 02:04:09,134
Well, I must be of to bed. I'm really devilish sleepy.

1601
02:04:10,749 --> 02:04:12,944
I was looking for something. What was it

1602
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:14,312
Your slippers

1603
02:04:14,853 --> 02:04:17,583
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1604
02:04:18,724 --> 02:04:21,022
Before you go, sir.

1605
02:04:24,763 --> 02:04:27,755
Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?

1606
02:04:28,834 --> 02:04:31,064
What the devil use would they be to Pickering?

1607
02:04:31,136 --> 02:04:32,967
Why bother about that in the middle of the night

1608
02:04:33,038 --> 02:04:34,699
What may I take away with me?

1609
02:04:34,773 --> 02:04:36,900
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1610
02:04:37,843 --> 02:04:38,935
Stealing?

1611
02:04:40,012 --> 02:04:42,901
You shouldn't have said that. That shows a want of feeling.

1612
02:04:43,415 --> 02:04:47,442
I'm sorry. I'm only a common, ignorant girl and in my station I have to be careful.

1613
02:04:47,519 --> 02:04:50,818
There can' t be any feelings between the likes of you and the likes of me.

1614
02:04:50,889 --> 02:04:53,881
Please, will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn 't

1615
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,449
Take the whole damned houseful if you want.

1616
02:04:57,696 --> 02:05:00,062
<i>Except the jewelry. That 's hired. Will that satisfy you?

1617
02:05:00,132 --> 02:05:01,190
Stop, please.

1618
02:05:03,802 --> 02:05:06,532
Will you take these to your room and keep them safe?

1619
02:05:07,673 --> 02:05:10,233
I don't want to run the ris of them being missed.

1620
02:05:12,177 --> 02:05:15,669
Oh, hand them over! If these belonged to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1621
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:18,341
I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat.

1622
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:22,711
The ring isn 't the jeweler's It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1623
02:05:24,056 --> 02:05:25,614
I don't want it now.

1624
02:05:28,894 --> 02:05:30,555
Don't you hit me!

1625
02:05:31,029 --> 02:05:34,226
Hit you? You infamous creature! How dare you suggest such a thing!

1626
02:05:34,299 --> 02:05:36,961
It's you who've hit me. You've wounded me to the heart

1627
02:05:37,035 --> 02:05:40,630
I'm glad. I've got a little of my own back anyhow.

1628
02:05:42,007 --> 02:05:45,397
You've caused me to lose my temper. That 's hardly happened to me before.

1629
02:05:45,477 --> 02:05:48,275
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight I'm going to bed.

1630
02:05:48,347 --> 02:05:50,736
Leave your own note for Mrs Pearce about the cofee...

1631
02:05:50,816 --> 02:05:52,443
for it won't be done by me!

1632
02:05:52,684 --> 02:05:56,279
Damn Mrs Pearce, damn the cofee and damn you!

1633
02:05:57,522 --> 02:06:00,787
Damn my own folly for having lavished my hard-earned knowledge...

1634
02:06:00,859 --> 02:06:05,023
and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1635
02:06:56,314 --> 02:07:00,910
<i>Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins</i> <i>Just you wait!</i>

1636
02:07:02,888 --> 02:07:07,120
<i>You'll be sorry</i> <i>But your tears will be too late</i>

1637
02:07:09,127 --> 02:07:12,016
<i>You will be the one it's done to</i>

1638
02:07:12,831 --> 02:07:16,062
<i>And you'll have no one to run to</i>

1639
02:07:16,668 --> 02:07:18,226
<i>Just you wait</i>

1640
02:07:46,932 --> 02:07:51,687
<i>I have often walked</i> <i>Down this street before</i>

1641
02:07:52,704 --> 02:07:57,494
<i>But the pavement always stayed</i> <i>Beneath my feet before</i>

1642
02:07:58,443 --> 02:08:03,471
<i>All at once am I <i>Several stories high</i>

1643
02:08:04,282 --> 02:08:08,810
<i>Knowing I'm on the street</i> <i>Where you live</i>

1644
02:08:10,288 --> 02:08:15,021
<i>Are there lilac trees</i> <i>In the heart of town?</i>

1645
02:08:16,127 --> 02:08:21,019
<i>Can you hear a lark</i> <i>In any other part of town?</i>

1646
02:08:22,133 --> 02:08:27,298
<i>Does enchantment pour</i> <i>Out of every door?</i>

1647
02:08:28,039 --> 02:08:32,601
<i>No, it's just</i> <i>On the street where you live</i>

1648
02:08:34,112 --> 02:08:38,708
<i>And, oh, the towering feeling</i>

1649
02:08:39,651 --> 02:08:44,384
<i>Just to know</i> <i>Somehow you are near</i>

1650
02:08:45,991 --> 02:08:50,416
<i>The overpowering feeling</i>

1651
02:08:51,062 --> 02:08:55,988
<i>That any second</i> <i>You may suddenly appear</i>

1652
02:08:57,469 --> 02:09:00,700
<i>People stop and stare</i> <i>They don't...</i>

1653
02:09:07,479 --> 02:09:08,434
Darling.

1654
02:09:09,948 --> 02:09:11,677
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1655
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:15,607
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here. It's the only place where I'm happy.

1656
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,347
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1657
02:09:17,422 --> 02:09:21,347
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle," do you hear? Eliza' s good enough for me.

1658
02:09:23,695 --> 02:09:26,960
Oh, Freddy, you don't think I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1659
02:09:27,365 --> 02:09:30,459
Darling, how could you imagine such a thing? You know how I feel.

1660
02:09:30,535 --> 02:09:33,993
I've written two and three times a day telling you. Sheets and sheets.

1661
02:09:34,072 --> 02:09:37,462
<i>Speak</i> <i>And the world is full of singing</i>

1662
02:09:37,642 --> 02:09:41,703
<i>And I am winging</i> <i>Higher than the birds</i>

1663
02:09:43,048 --> 02:09:46,506
<i>Touch</i> <i>And my heart begins to crumble</i>

1664
02:09:46,885 --> 02:09:50,707
<i>The heavens tumble</i> <i>Darling, and I'm...</i>

1665
02:09:50,855 --> 02:09:53,847
<i>Words, words, words</i> <i>I'm so sick of words</i>

1666
02:09:54,025 --> 02:09:57,119
<i>I get words all day through</i> <i>First from him, now from you</i>

1667
02:09:57,262 --> 02:10:00,459
<i>Is that all you blighters can do?</i>

1668
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:05,024
<i>Don't talk of stars burning above</i>

1669
02:10:05,437 --> 02:10:07,928
<i>If you're in love, show me</i>

1670
02:10:08,773 --> 02:10:11,799
<i>Tell me no dreams filled with desire</i>

1671
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:14,601
<i>If you're on fire, show me</i>

1672
02:10:15,347 --> 02:10:17,736
<i>Here we are together</i> <i>In the middle of the night</i>

1673
02:10:17,816 --> 02:10:21,081
<i>Don't talk of spring</i> <i>Just hold me tight</i>

1674
02:10:21,886 --> 02:10:24,252
<i>Anyone who's ever been in love'll</i> <i>Tell you that</i>

1675
02:10:24,322 --> 02:10:26,244
<i>This is no time for a chat</i>

1676
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:31,349
<i>Haven't your lips longed for my touch?</i>

1677
02:10:31,863 --> 02:10:34,229

<i>Show me</i>

1679
02:10:36,868 --> 02:10:39,962
<i>Don't talk of love lasting through time</i>

1680
02:10:40,305 --> 02:10:42,865

02:10:53,551 --> 02:10:56,384
<i>Don't waste my time, show me</i>

1684
02:10:57,022 --> 02:11:00,321
<i>Don't talk of June, don't talk of Fall</i>

1685
02:11:00,425 --> 02:11:03,349
<i>Don't talk at all, show me</i>

1686
02:11:03,862 --> 02:11:06,160
<i>Never do I ever</i> <i>Want to hear another word</i>

1687
02:11:06,231 --> 02:11:09,723
<i>There isn't one I haven't heard</i>

1688
02:11:10,468 --> 02:11:12,959
<i>Here we are together</i> <i>In what ought to be a dream</i>

1689
02:11:13,004 --> 02:11:16,496
<i>Say one more word and I'll scream</i>

1690
02:11:17,242 --> 02:11:20,268
<i>Haven't your arms hungered for mine?</i>

1691
02:11:20,645 --> 02:11:23,034
<i>Please don't explain, show me</i>

1692
02:11:23,782 --> 02:11:25,374
<i>Show me</i>

1693
02:11:25,784 --> 02:11:28,742
<i>Don't wait until wrinkles and lines</i>

1694
02:11:29,154 --> 02:11:32,009
<i>Pop out all over my brow</i>

1695
02:11:32,557 --> 02:11:36,846
<i>Show me now!</i>

1696
02:11:41,299 --> 02:11:43,062

02:12:20,572 --> 02:12:22,460
Darling, shall I come with you?

1703
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:52,592
<i>With one enormous chair</i>

1704
02:12:52,737 --> 02:12:56,969
<i>Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?</i>

1705
02:12:58,276 --> 02:13:02,508
<i>Lots of chocolate for me to eat</i>

1706
02:13:03,281 --> 02:13:07,570
<i>Lots of coal makin'lots of 'eat</i>

<i>Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet</i>

1708
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:16,913
<i>Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?</i>

1709
02:13:19,898 --> 02:13:21,297
Buy a flower, Miss?

02:13:22,801 --> 02:13:23,893
Yes, please.

1711
02:14:01,105 --> 02:14:03,266
Good morning, Miss. Can I help you?

1712
02:14:06,678 --> 02:14:08,441
Do you mind if I warm my <i>hands</i>

1713
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,313
Go right ahead, Miss.

1714
02:14:19,023 --> 02:14:21,912
<i>Excuse me, Miss. For a second lthought you were somebody else.

1715
02:14:21,993 --> 02:14:22,982
Who?

1716
02:14:23,595 --> 02:14:27,190
Forgive me, ma 'am. Early morning light playing tricks with my eyes

1717
02:14:27,365 --> 02:14:30,323
Can I get you a taxi, ma 'am? A lady like you shouldn't be walkin' alone...

1718
02:14:30,401 --> 02:14:32,699

1719
02:14:34,572 --> 02:14:35,971
No, thank you.

1720
02:14:45,450 --> 02:14:49,272
<i>Someone's head restin' on my knee</i>

1721
02:14:49,787 --> 02:14:53,484
<i>Warm and tender as he can be</i>

1722
02:14:54,692 --> 02:14:57,889
<i>Who takes good care of me</i>

1723

02:15:05,937 --> 02:15:08,360
<i>Loverly</i>

1726
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:09,997
<i>Loverly</i>

1727
02:15:11,576 --> 02:15:14,704
<i>Loverly</i>

1728
02:15:14,779 --> 02:15:16,508
<i>Loverly</i>

1729
02:15:22,453 --> 02:15:26,651
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle. We value your patronage always

1730
02:15:26,758 --> 02:15:29,784
Thank you, my good man. Thank you. Here. Come 'ere.

1731
02:15:30,561 --> 02:15:33,189
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton with my compliments.

1732
02:15:33,264 --> 02:15:35,095
Thank you, Mr. Doolittle.

1733
02:15:36,367 --> 02:15:39,530
Jolly spot this, Harry. We must visit it more often.

1734
02:15:40,538 --> 02:15:41,493
Father?

1735
02:15:43,775 --> 02:15:47,108
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

1736
02:15:47,378 --> 02:15:51,474
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery, he did. Me own flesh and blood.

1737
02:15:54,419 --> 02:15:57,479
Well, I'm miserable, all right You can tell him that straight

1738
02:15:57,588 --> 02:16:00,113
What are you talking about What are you dressed up for?

1739
02:16:00,358 --> 02:16:01,791
As if you didn't know.

1740
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:05,590
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil. Tell him what he's done to me.

1741
02:16:06,064 --> 02:16:07,554
What 's he done to you?

1742
02:16:08,099 --> 02:16:09,396
Ruined me, that 's all.

1743
02:16:09,467 --> 02:16:13,164
Tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle-class morality.

1744
02:16:13,705 --> 02:16:15,104
And don't you defend him.

1745
02:16:15,173 --> 02:16:19,337
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to a old American blighter named Wallingford...

1746
02:16:19,777 --> 02:16:23,975
who was giving five millions to found Moral Reform societies...

1747
02:16:24,449 --> 02:16:28,806
to tell him the most original moralis in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1748
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:30,610
a common dustma

1749
02:16:32,190 --> 02:16:33,748
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1750
02:16:34,292 --> 02:16:37,181
You may call it a j It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1751
02:16:37,829 --> 02:16:42,061
The old bloke died and left me 4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1752
02:16:43,501 --> 02:16:47,597
Who asked him to make a gentleman outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

1753
02:16:48,206 --> 02:16:52,131
Itouched pretty nigh everyone for money when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1754
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:56,105
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels and everybody touches me.

1755
02:16:56,814 --> 02:16:59,703
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1756
02:17:00,418 --> 02:17:02,511
except one or two who wouldn't speak to me.

1757
02:17:02,587 --> 02:17:06,114
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages amongst the 'ot of them.

1758
02:17:06,858 --> 02:17:11,522
Oh, I have to live for others now, not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1759
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:15,563
Come on, Alfile, in a couple of hours we have to be at the church.

1760
02:17:15,633 --> 02:17:17,828
- Church? - Yeah, church.

1761
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:20,758
The deepest cut of all.

1762
02:17:21,272 --> 02:17:24,298
Why do you think I'm dressed up like a ruddy pallbearer?

1763
02:17:25,043 --> 02:17:26,874
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1764
02:17:27,011 --> 02:17:29,866
Now I'm respectable, she wants to be respectable.

1765
02:17:30,148 --> 02:17:33,538
If that 's the way you feel about it, why don't you give the money back?

1766
02:17:33,618 --> 02:17:35,415
That 's the tragedy of it, Eliza

1767
02:17:35,953 --> 02:17:37,818
It's easy to say chuck it...

1768
02:17:38,656 --> 02:17:40,283
but I 'aven't the nerve.

1769
02:17:40,825 --> 02:17:43,487
We're all intimidated. That 's what we are, intimidated.

1770
02:17:43,561 --> 02:17:46,223
Bought up. Yeah. That 's what I am.

1771
02:17:46,964 --> 02:17:49,489
That 's what your precious professor's brought me to.

1772
02:17:49,734 --> 02:17:51,690
Not my precious professor.

1773
02:17:52,437 --> 02:17:54,325
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1774
02:17:56,007 --> 02:18:00,933
First he shoves me in the middle-class, then he chucks you out for me to support

1775
02:18:01,546 --> 02:18:03,377
That 's all part of his pla...

1776
02:18:04,182 --> 02:18:05,911
but you double-cross him.

1777
02:18:06,684 --> 02:18:10,848
Don't you come back home to me. Don't you take tuppence from me.

1778
02:18:11,456 --> 02:18:14,653
You stand on your own two feet You're a lady now, you can do it

1779
02:18:15,093 --> 02:18:18,017
Yeah, that 's right, Eliza You're a lady now.

1780
02:18:18,696 --> 02:18:20,789
<i>Eliza, it's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1781
02:18:20,865 --> 02:18:24,653
Here, Eliza, would you like to come and see me turned of this morning? Eh?

02:18:25,069 --> 02:18:27,663
St George's, Hanover Square, ten o'clock.

1783
02:18:27,805 --> 02:18:29,830
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

1784
02:18:29,907 --> 02:18:31,101
No, thank you, Dad.

1785
02:18:32,577 --> 02:18:34,340

Come along, Alfile.

1790
02:19:04,242 --> 02:19:05,869
How much time have I got left?

1791
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:08,943

<i>If I am whistlin'</i> <i>Me out the door</i>

1837
02:22:08,826 --> 02:22:12,489
<i>Drug me or jail me</i> <i>Stamp me and mail me</i>

1838
02:22:12,697 --> 02:22:14,528
<i>But get me to the church</i>

1839
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:16,323
<i>Get him to the church</i>

02:24:19,757 --> 02:24:21,748
<i>Good health</i>

02:24:21,826 --> 02:24:24,386
<i>Goodbye</i>

<i>on time</i>

1864
02:25:07,271 --> 02:25:09,330
Didn't she say where to send her <i>clothes</i>

1865
02:25:09,406 --> 02:25:11,829
ltold you, sir, she took them all with her.

1866
02:25:12,276 --> 02:25:15,040
Here's a confounded thing. <i>Eliza' s bolted. Bolted!

1867
02:25:15,112 --> 02:25:18,570
Last night Mrs Pearce let her go without telling me a thing about it

1868
02:25:18,649 --> 02:25:20,810
What am I to do? I got tea this morning instead of cofee.

1869
02:25:20,885 --> 02:25:23,376
I don't know where anything is, what my appointments are.

1870
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:25,615
- Eliza' d know. - Damn it, she's gone!

1871
02:25:25,689 --> 02:25:28,055
Did either of you gentlemen frighten her last night

1872
02:25:28,125 --> 02:25:30,150
We hardly said a word to her. You were there.

1873
02:25:30,227 --> 02:25:31,854
Did you bully her after I went to bed?

1874
02:25:31,929 --> 02:25:33,726
She threw the slippers at me.

1875
02:25:33,797 --> 02:25:35,287
I never gave her the slightest provocation.

1876
02:25:35,366 --> 02:25:38,096
The slippers came bang at my head before I uttered a word.

1877
02:25:38,168 --> 02:25:42,264
She used the most disgraceful language. I was shocked! I don't understand it

1878
02:25:42,339 --> 02:25:44,830
We always gave her every consideration. She admitted it

1879
02:25:44,909 --> 02:25:45,773
I'm dashed!

1880
02:25:45,843 --> 02:25:49,335
Oh, Pickering, for God's sake, stop being dashed and do something!

1881
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,108
Phone the police. What are they there for in heaven's name?

1882
02:25:52,182 --> 02:25:54,707
You can' t give Eliza' s name to the police...

1883
02:25:54,785 --> 02:25:56,912
as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella

1884
02:25:56,987 --> 02:25:58,909
But why not I want to find the girl.

1885
02:25:58,989 --> 02:26:01,253
She belongs to me. I paid five pounds for her.

1886
02:26:01,959 --> 02:26:04,621
Quite right Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1887
02:26:04,962 --> 02:26:06,918
Get me some cofee, would you please?

1888
02:26:08,132 --> 02:26:09,190
Scotland Yard?

1889
02:26:10,067 --> 02:26:13,924
I beg your pardon, yes This is, this is Colonel Pickering speaking.

1890
02:26:15,072 --> 02:26:17,768
27 A Wimpole Street

1891
02:26:18,275 --> 02:26:20,505
I want to report a missing person.

1892
02:26:21,178 --> 02:26:23,476
Miss Eliza Doolittle.

1893
02:26:24,481 --> 02:26:25,436
About 21.

1894
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:29,505
Oh, I should say about 5 foot 7.

1895
02:26:30,754 --> 02:26:34,713
Her <i>eyes</i> Let me think now. Her eyes Her eyes- -

1896
02:26:35,059 --> 02:26:36,822
- Brown. - Brown.

1897
02:26:39,563 --> 02:26:44,296
Her hair? Oh, good Lord. Well, sort of nondescript neutral sort of- -

1898
02:26:44,368 --> 02:26:45,995
Brown, brown, brown!

1899
02:26:46,103 --> 02:26:48,594
You heard what he said? Brown, brown, brown, yes

1900
02:26:48,872 --> 02:26:51,295
No, no, no. This is her residence. 27 A...

1901
02:26:51,442 --> 02:26:55,230
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00 this morning, I understand.

1902
02:26:56,413 --> 02:26:59,507
No, no, no... No, she's no relation, no.

1903
02:27:00,451 --> 02:27:03,249
Well, just let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1904
02:27:03,854 --> 02:27:05,116
I beg your pardon?

1905
02:27:05,422 --> 02:27:08,186
Listen to me, my man, I don't like the tenor of that question.

1906
02:27:08,258 --> 02:27:10,647
What the girl does here is our affair.

1907
02:27:11,929 --> 02:27:15,285
Your affair is to get her back so she can continue doing it

1908
02:27:16,033 --> 02:27:17,523
Well, I'm dashed!

1909
02:27:20,070 --> 02:27:23,062
<i>What in all, in heaven</i> <i>Could have prompted her to go?</i>

1910
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:25,233
<i>After such a triumph at the ball</i>

1911
02:27:26,176 --> 02:27:27,700
<i>What could have depressed her?</i>

1912
02:27:27,778 --> 02:27:31,373
<i>What could have possessed her?</i> <i>I cannot understand the wretch at all</i>

1913
02:27:33,917 --> 02:27:37,774
Higgins, I have an old school chum at the Home Ofice. Perhaps he could help.

1914
02:27:38,122 --> 02:27:39,612
Think I'll give him a ring.

1915
02:27:41,525 --> 02:27:44,221
Whitehall: 7244, please.

1916
02:27:46,897 --> 02:27:49,422
<i>Women are irrational</i> <i>That's all there is to that</i>

1917
02:27:49,633 --> 02:27:51,897
<i>Their heads are full of</i> <i>Cotton, hay and rags</i>

1918
02:27:52,736 --> 02:27:56,502
<i>They're nothing but exasperating</i> <i>Irritating, vacillating, calculating</i>

1919
02:27:56,573 --> 02:27:59,303
<i>Agitating, maddening</i> <i>And infuriating hags</i>

1920
02:28:00,844 --> 02:28:04,007
I want to speak to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

1921
02:28:04,982 --> 02:28:06,415
Yes, I'll wait

1922
02:28:11,789 --> 02:28:15,816
Pickering, why can' t a woman be more like a man?

1923
02:28:16,694 --> 02:28:17,820
I beg your pardon?

1924
02:28:18,429 --> 02:28:21,728
Yes, why can' t a woman be more like a man?

1925
02:28:22,599 --> 02:28:25,295
<i>Men are so honest, so thoroughly square</i>

1926
02:28:25,703 --> 02:28:28,467
<i>Eternally noble, historically fair</i>

1927
02:28:29,139 --> 02:28:31,733
<i>Who, when you win</i> <i>Will always give your back a pat?</i>

1928
02:28:32,576 --> 02:28:34,840
<i>Why can't a woman be like that?</i>

1929
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:38,771
<i>Why does every one do</i> <i>What the others do?</i>

1930
02:28:39,717 --> 02:28:42,049
<i>Can't a woman learn to use her head?</i>

1931
02:28:43,153 --> 02:28:45,519
<i>Why do they do everything</i> <i>Their mothers do?</i>

1932
02:28:45,989 --> 02:28:49,322
<i>Why don't they grow up</i> <i>Well, like their father instead?</i>

1933
02:28:49,526 --> 02:28:52,017
<i>Why can't a woman take after a man?</i>

1934
02:28:52,663 --> 02:28:55,518
<i>Men are so pleasant, so easy to please</i>

1935
02:28:56,033 --> 02:28:58,661
<i>Whenever you're with them</i> <i>You're always at ease</i>

1936
02:28:59,369 --> 02:29:01,860
<i>Would you be slighted</i> <i>If I didn't speak for hours?</i>

1937
02:29:02,573 --> 02:29:05,167
<i>Would you be livid</i> <i>If I had a drink or two?</i>

1938
02:29:05,909 --> 02:29:08,469
<i>Would you be wounded</i> <i>If I never sent you flowers?</i>

1939
02:29:08,946 --> 02:29:11,676
<i>Well, why can't a woman be like you?</i>

1940
02:29:13,117 --> 02:29:15,347
<i>One man in a million may shout a bit</i>

1941
02:29:16,487 --> 02:29:18,853
<i>Now and then</i> <i>There's one with slight defects</i>

1942
02:29:19,857 --> 02:29:22,348
<i>One perhaps whose truthfulness</i> <i>You doubt a bit</i>

1943
02:29:22,392 --> 02:29:26,158
<i>But by and large</i> <i>We are a marvelous sex</i>

1944
02:29:26,463 --> 02:29:28,852
<i>Why can't a woman take after a man?</i>

1945
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:32,296
<i>Cause men are so friendly</i> <i>Good-natured and kind</i>

1946
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:35,600
<i>A better companion</i> <i>You never will find</i>

1947
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:39,195
<i>If I were hours late for dinner</i> <i>Would you bellow?</i>

1948
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:42,240
<i>If I forgot your silly birthday</i> <i>Would you fuss?</i>

1949
02:29:42,713 --> 02:29:45,477
<i>Would you complain</i> <i>If I took out another fellow?</i>

1950
02:29:45,983 --> 02:29:48,679
<i>Well, why can't a woman be like us?</i>

1951
02:29:52,422 --> 02:29:53,719
Is Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

1952
02:29:54,925 --> 02:29:59,191
Bruzzie. Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never guess who this is

1953
02:30:00,564 --> 02:30:04,125
You're quite right, it is Good heavens By George, what a memory.

1954
02:30:05,435 --> 02:30:08,131
How are you, Bruzzie? Nice to hear your voice.

1955
02:30:09,173 --> 02:30:12,131
What? You don't say. Has it really been 30 years, Bruzzie?

1956
02:30:12,943 --> 02:30:14,205
Quite right Yes, oceans of water.

1957
02:30:14,278 --> 02:30:16,576
Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.

1958
02:30:16,647 --> 02:30:20,413
Something rather unpleasant happened at this end. Could I come and see you?

1959
02:30:20,484 --> 02:30:22,509
Well, I could, yes Now, straight away?

1960
02:30:22,586 --> 02:30:23,780
Right Good. Thank you.

1961
02:30:23,854 --> 02:30:25,913
Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much.

1962
02:30:33,397 --> 02:30:36,059
Mrs Pearce, I'm going along to the Home Ofice.

1963
02:30:36,934 --> 02:30:39,198
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

1964
02:30:39,336 --> 02:30:40,928
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

1965
02:30:41,338 --> 02:30:44,694
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh? Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!

1966
02:30:56,887 --> 02:30:58,980
- Mrs Pearce? - Yes, sir.

1967
02:30:59,389 --> 02:31:00,378
Where's the Colonel?

1968
02:31:00,457 --> 02:31:02,379
He's gone to the Home Ofice, sir.

1969
02:31:03,694 --> 02:31:08,620
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs for help. Now there's a good fellow.

1970
02:31:10,467 --> 02:31:12,856
Mrs Pearce, you're a woman.

1971

<i>Why can't a woman be more like a man?</i>

1972

1975
02:31:27,551 --> 02:31:30,213
<i>Why can't a woman be a chum?</i>

1976
02:31:31,455 --> 02:31:33,946
<i>Why is thinking</i> <i>Something women never do?</i>

1977
02:31:34,858 --> 02:31:37,349
<i>And why is logic never even tried?</i>

1978
02:31:38,095 --> 02:31:40,689
<i>Straightening up their hair</i> <i>Is all they ever do</i>

1979
02:31:41,131 --> 02:31:44,589
<i>Why don't they straighten up</i> <i>The mess that's inside?</i>

1980
02:31:44,668 --> 02:31:47,262
<i>Why can't a woman behave like a man?</i>

1981
02:31:47,971 --> 02:31:50,531
<i>If I was a woman</i> <i>Who'd been to a ball</i>

1982
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:53,903
<i>Been hailed as a princess</i> <i>By one and by all</i>

1983
02:31:54,544 --> 02:31:57,069
<i>Would I start weeping</i> <i>Like a bathtub overflowing?</i>

1984
02:31:57,648 --> 02:32:00,139
<i>Or carry on as if my home</i> <i>Were in a tree?</i>

1985
02:32:00,784 --> 02:32:03,514
<i>Would I run off</i> <i>And never tell me where I'm going?</i>

1986
02:32:04,021 --> 02:32:06,751
<i>Why can't a woman be like me?</i>

1987
02:32:11,295 --> 02:32:14,184
You mean that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them...

1988
02:32:14,264 --> 02:32:15,754
without making a mistake...

1989
02:32:15,832 --> 02:32:17,823
they just sat there and never said a word?

1990
02:32:17,901 --> 02:32:21,723
Never petted you, or admired you, or told you how splendid you'd been?

1991
02:32:21,805 --> 02:32:22,703
Not a word.

1992
02:32:22,773 --> 02:32:25,765
They just congratulated each other on how marvelous they'd been.

1993
02:32:25,842 --> 02:32:28,333
The next moment, how glad they were it was all over...

1994
02:32:28,412 --> 02:32:30,243
and what a bore it had all been.

1995
02:32:30,314 --> 02:32:33,374
This is simply appalling. I should not have thrown my slippers at him.

1996
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:35,441
Ishould have thrown the fire irons

1997
02:32:36,019 --> 02:32:37,043
Who's that?

1998
02:32:37,321 --> 02:32:40,017
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

1999
02:32:41,625 --> 02:32:42,785
Now, remember...

2000
02:32:43,727 --> 02:32:47,424
you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess.

2001
02:32:54,938 --> 02:32:57,236
Mother, the most confounded thing... Do you...

2002
02:33:01,211 --> 02:33:02,109
You!

2003
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:05,642
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins Are you quite well?

2004
02:33:07,551 --> 02:33:11,681
Of course you are. You are never ill. Would you care for some tea

2005
02:33:12,456 --> 02:33:15,254
Don't you dare try that game on me. Itaught it to you.

2006
02:33:15,659 --> 02:33:17,217
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

2007
02:33:17,294 --> 02:33:18,818
You've caused me enough trouble.

2008
02:33:18,895 --> 02:33:22,922
Very nicely put indeed, Henry. No woman could resist such an invitation.

2009
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,797
How did this baggage get here?

2010
02:33:24,868 --> 02:33:27,826
<i>Eliza came to see me this morning and I was delighted to have her.

2011
02:33:27,904 --> 02:33:30,668
If you don't promise to behave yourself lmust as you to leave.

2012
02:33:30,741 --> 02:33:32,971
You mean, I'm to put on my Sunday manners for this...

2013
02:33:33,043 --> 02:33:36,638
thing that I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

2014
02:33:36,713 --> 02:33:38,408
That 's precisely what I mea

2015
02:33:40,217 --> 02:33:42,947
However did you learn good manners with my son around?

2016
02:33:43,553 --> 02:33:46,784
It was very dificult I should never have known how ladies...

2017
02:33:46,857 --> 02:33:49,519
and gentlemen behave if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

2018
02:33:52,229 --> 02:33:54,094
He showed me that he felt and thought about me...

2019
02:33:54,164 --> 02:33:57,019
as if I were something better than a common flower girl.

2020
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:03,533
You see, Mrs Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up...

2021
02:34:04,307 --> 02:34:07,868
the diference between a lady and a flower girl isn 't how she behaves...

2022
02:34:07,944 --> 02:34:09,571
but how she is treated.

2023
02:34:12,649 --> 02:34:14,844
Ishall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins...

2024
02:34:14,918 --> 02:34:18,046
because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.

2025
02:34:19,456 --> 02:34:21,583
I know I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2026
02:34:21,658 --> 02:34:24,456
because he always treats me as a lady and always will.

2027
02:34:29,866 --> 02:34:31,356
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2028
02:34:31,401 --> 02:34:34,234
The bishop is here, Madam. Shall I show him into the garden?

2029
02:34:34,304 --> 02:34:36,693
The bishop and the professor? Good heavens, no!

2030
02:34:36,907 --> 02:34:38,534
Ishould be excommunicated.

2031
02:34:39,009 --> 02:34:40,601
I'll see him in the library.

2032
02:34:41,711 --> 02:34:44,373
<i>Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2033
02:34:44,581 --> 02:34:47,072
I give you full permission to have him evicted.

2034
02:34:47,350 --> 02:34:51,582
Henry dear, I suggest you stick to two subjects: The weather and your health.

2035
02:35:19,416 --> 02:35:21,441
You've had a bit of your own back, as you say.

2036
02:35:21,518 --> 02:35:25,181
Have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more?

2037
02:35:25,255 --> 02:35:27,052
You want me back to pick up your slippers...

2038
02:35:27,124 --> 02:35:30,048
and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.

2039
02:35:30,227 --> 02:35:31,854
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

2040
02:35:31,928 --> 02:35:33,520
Indeed? Then what are we talking about

2041
02:35:33,597 --> 02:35:35,258
Well, about you, not about me.

2042
02:35:35,499 --> 02:35:37,797
If you come back you'll be treated as you've always been.

2043
02:35:37,868 --> 02:35:40,359
I can' t change my nature or my manners

2044
02:35:40,403 --> 02:35:43,201
My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's

2045
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:46,605
That 's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess.

2046
02:35:47,277 --> 02:35:49,507
And I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl.

2047
02:35:49,579 --> 02:35:51,376
Oh, I see. The same to everybody.

2048
02:35:52,215 --> 02:35:54,979
You see, the great secret is not a question of good manners...

2049
02:35:55,051 --> 02:35:58,509
or bad manners or any particular sort of manners...

2050
02:35:59,022 --> 02:36:02,378
but having the same manner for all human souls

2051
02:36:04,261 --> 02:36:06,684
The question is not whether I treat you rudely...

2052
02:36:06,763 --> 02:36:09,789
but whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better.

2053
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:12,461
I don't care how you treat me.

2054
02:36:12,536 --> 02:36:15,198
I don't mind your swearing at me. Ishouldn't mind a black eye.

2055
02:36:15,272 --> 02:36:18,127
I've had one before this But I won't be passed over!

2056
02:36:18,775 --> 02:36:20,663
Get out of my way, for I won't stop for you.

2057
02:36:20,744 --> 02:36:22,666
You talk about me as though I was a motorbus

2058
02:36:22,746 --> 02:36:26,705
So you are a motorbus All bounce and go and no consideration for anybody.

2059
02:36:27,417 --> 02:36:30,181
But I can get along without you. Don't you think I can' t

2060
02:36:30,253 --> 02:36:32,278
I know you ca I told you, you could.

2061
02:36:36,092 --> 02:36:38,322
You've never wondered, I suppose, whether...

2062
02:36:38,762 --> 02:36:40,992
whether I could get along without you?

2063
02:36:42,399 --> 02:36:45,425
Don't you try to get around me. You'll have to.

2064
02:36:46,636 --> 02:36:48,900
So I can, without you or any soul on Earth.

2065
02:36:52,409 --> 02:36:56,539
Ishall miss you, Eliza I've learned something from your idiotic notions

2066
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,805
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

2067
02:37:02,786 --> 02:37:05,175
Well, you have my voice on your gramophone.

2068
02:37:05,255 --> 02:37:09,385
When you feel lonely without me you ca turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt

2069
02:37:11,261 --> 02:37:14,025
Well, I can' t turn your soul on.

2070
02:37:16,666 --> 02:37:18,930
Oh, you are a devil!

2071
02:37:19,903 --> 02:37:22,394
You can twist the heart in a girl just as easily...

2072
02:37:22,472 --> 02:37:24,702
as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2073
02:37:25,041 --> 02:37:26,736
What am I to come back for?

2074
02:37:27,177 --> 02:37:29,270
For the fun of it That 's why I took you on.

2075
02:37:29,346 --> 02:37:31,906
You may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want.

2076
02:37:31,982 --> 02:37:35,645
Yes And you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want.

2077
02:37:35,719 --> 02:37:36,913
And live with my father?

2078
02:37:36,987 --> 02:37:39,353
Yes, or sell flowers Would you rather marry Pickering?

2079
02:37:39,422 --> 02:37:43,279
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age then what he is

2080
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,251
I'll talk as I like. You're not my teacher now.

2081
02:37:46,763 --> 02:37:49,254
That 's not what I want and don't you think it is

2082
02:37:49,666 --> 02:37:51,930
I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way.

2083
02:37:52,002 --> 02:37:55,096
Freddy Hill writes me twice and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2084
02:37:55,171 --> 02:37:58,868
In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is, is that it

2085
02:37:59,242 --> 02:38:03,235
No, I don't That 's not the sort of feeling I want from you.

2086
02:38:04,314 --> 02:38:05,838
I want a little kindness.

2087
02:38:06,683 --> 02:38:10,016
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl, and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2088
02:38:10,086 --> 02:38:12,111
but I'm not dirt under your feet

2089
02:38:12,789 --> 02:38:17,783
What I done... what I did was not for the taxis and the dresses...

2090
02:38:18,194 --> 02:38:21,857
but because we were pleasant together and I come to... came...

2091
02:38:23,199 --> 02:38:24,598
to care for you.

2092
02:38:25,235 --> 02:38:26,600
Not to want you to make love to me...

2093
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:29,298
and not forgetting the diference between us, but...

2094
02:38:30,073 --> 02:38:31,734
more friendly like.

2095
02:38:33,943 --> 02:38:36,070
Well, of course. That 's how I feel.

2096
02:38:36,813 --> 02:38:40,601
And how Pickering feels <i>Eliza, you're a fool!

2097
02:38:40,717 --> 02:38:42,116
That 's not the proper answer.

2098
02:38:42,185 --> 02:38:43,914
It's the only answer till you stop being a idiot

2099
02:38:43,987 --> 02:38:46,148
If you want to be a lady, you must stop feeling neglected...

2100
02:38:46,222 --> 02:38:48,645
if the men don't spend half their time sniveling over you...

2101
02:38:48,725 --> 02:38:50,784
and the other half giving you black eyes

2102
02:38:50,860 --> 02:38:53,351
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?

2103
02:38:53,797 --> 02:38:55,662
Of with you to the sort of people you like.

2104
02:38:55,732 --> 02:38:57,654
Marry a sentimental hog with lots of money...

2105
02:38:57,734 --> 02:39:00,498
and thick lips to kiss you, and thick boots to kick you.

2106
02:39:00,570 --> 02:39:03,334
If you can' t appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate.

2107
02:39:03,773 --> 02:39:06,901
I can' t talk to you. You always turn everything against me.

2108
02:39:07,010 --> 02:39:08,568
I'm always in the wrong.

2109
02:39:09,145 --> 02:39:11,170
Don't be too sure you have me under your feet...

2110
02:39:11,247 --> 02:39:13,238
to be trampled on and talked down.

2111
02:39:13,483 --> 02:39:16,509
I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as I'm able to support him.

2112
02:39:18,888 --> 02:39:21,118
That poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy...

2113
02:39:21,191 --> 02:39:23,147
even if he had the guts to try for it

2114
02:39:23,226 --> 02:39:26,855
Woman, don't you understand? I have made you a consort for a king!

2115
02:39:27,163 --> 02:39:30,121
Freddy loves me. That makes him king enough for me.

2116
02:39:30,266 --> 02:39:33,224
I don't want him to work. He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

2117
02:39:33,303 --> 02:39:34,736
I'll go and be a teacher.

2118
02:39:35,438 --> 02:39:37,429
What 'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2119
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:40,065
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics

2120
02:39:44,447 --> 02:39:48,713
I'll ofer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungaria

2121
02:39:49,586 --> 02:39:53,249
What, that imposter? That humbug? That toadying <i>ignoramus</i>

2122
02:39:53,656 --> 02:39:55,817
Teach him my methods, my <i>discoveries</i>

2123
02:39:55,892 --> 02:39:58,520
You take one step in that direction, I'll wring your neck!

2124
02:39:58,595 --> 02:40:02,053
Wring away! What do I care? I knew you'd strike me one day.

2125
02:40:05,335 --> 02:40:08,259
That 's done you, 'Enry 'lggins, it 'as.

2126
02:40:08,371 --> 02:40:11,431
Now, I don't care for your bullyin' an'your big talk.

2127
02:40:12,742 --> 02:40:14,630
<i>What a fool I was</i>

2128
02:40:14,711 --> 02:40:16,338
<i>What a dominated fool</i>

2129
02:40:16,613 --> 02:40:19,411
<i>To think you were the Earth and sky</i>

2130
02:40:20,016 --> 02:40:21,711
<i>What a fool I was</i>

2131
02:40:21,785 --> 02:40:23,480
<i>What an addle-pated fool</i>

2132
02:40:23,686 --> 02:40:27,076
<i>What a mutton-headed dolt was I

2133
02:40:28,258 --> 02:40:31,489
<i>No, my reverberating friend</i>

2134
02:40:31,961 --> 02:40:36,091
<i>You are not the beginning and the end</i>

2135
02:40:38,868 --> 02:40:40,358
You impudent hussy!

2136
02:40:40,570 --> 02:40:44,734
There's not an idea in your head or a word in your mouth that I haven't put there.

2137
02:40:46,609 --> 02:40:51,205
<i>There'll be spring every year</i> <i>Without you</i>

2138
02:40:52,048 --> 02:40:55,245
<i>England still will be here</i> <i>Without you</i>

2139
02:40:55,952 --> 02:40:59,683
<i>There'll be fruit on the tree</i> <i>And a shore by the sea</i>

2140
02:40:59,756 --> 02:41:02,953
<i>There'll be crumpets and tea</i> <i>Without you</i>

2141
02:41:03,560 --> 02:41:06,688
<i>Art and music will thrive</i> <i>Without you</i>

2142
02:41:07,397 --> 02:41:10,560
<i>Somehow Keats will survive</i> <i>Without you</i>

2143
02:41:11,201 --> 02:41:14,989
<i>And there still will be rain</i> <i>On that plain down in Spain</i>

2144
02:41:15,104 --> 02:41:18,301
<i>Even that will remain</i> <i>Without you</i>

2145
02:41:18,875 --> 02:41:20,638
<i>I can do</i>

2146
02:41:22,579 --> 02:41:24,012
<i>Without you</i>

2147
02:41:25,248 --> 02:41:27,978
<i>You, dear friend</i>

2148
02:41:28,051 --> 02:41:31,282
<i>Who talk so well</i>

2149
02:41:32,589 --> 02:41:36,081
<i>You can go to</i>

2150
02:41:36,292 --> 02:41:38,954
<i>Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire</i>

2151
02:41:39,629 --> 02:41:42,553
<i>They can still rule the land</i> <i>Without you</i>

2152
02:41:43,233 --> 02:41:46,498
<i>Windsor Castle will stand</i> <i>Without you</i>

2153
02:41:47,036 --> 02:41:50,699
<i>And without much ado</i> <i>We can all muddle through</i>

2154
02:41:50,773 --> 02:41:52,536
<i>Without you!</i>

2155
02:41:52,775 --> 02:41:54,504
You brazen hussy!

2156
02:41:55,211 --> 02:41:58,942
<i>Without your pulling it</i> <i>The tide comes in</i>

2157
02:41:59,516 --> 02:42:03,407
<i>Without your twirling it</i> <i>The Earth can spin</i>

2158
02:42:03,586 --> 02:42:08,114
<i>Without your pushing them</i> <i>The clouds roll by</i>

2159
02:42:08,892 --> 02:42:14,023
<i>If they can do without you, Ducky</i> <i>So can I

2160
02:42:14,297 --> 02:42:17,789
<i>I shall not feel alone</i> <i>Without you</i>

2161
02:42:18,034 --> 02:42:21,231
<i>I can stand on my own</i> <i>Without you</i>

2162
02:42:21,804 --> 02:42:25,570
<i>So go back in your shell</i> <i>I can do bloody well...</i>

2163
02:42:26,142 --> 02:42:29,908
<i>By George, I really did it</i> <i>I did it, I did it</i>

2164
02:42:30,079 --> 02:42:32,741
<i>I said I'd make a woman</i> <i>And indeed I did</i>

2165
02:42:32,916 --> 02:42:35,646
<i>I knew that I could do it</i> <i>I knew it, I knew it</i>

2166
02:42:35,818 --> 02:42:38,343
<i>I said I'd make a woman</i> <i>And succeed I did</i>

2167
02:42:38,721 --> 02:42:40,211
<i>Eliza, you're magnificent

2168
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:43,415
Five minutes ago you were a millstone around my neck...

2169
02:42:43,493 --> 02:42:45,518
and now you're a tower of strength.

2170
02:42:45,595 --> 02:42:47,222
A consort battleship.

2171
02:42:48,598 --> 02:42:50,190
I like you this way.

2172
02:42:52,435 --> 02:42:56,257
Goodbye, Professor Higgins You shall not be seeing me again.

2173
02:43:09,919 --> 02:43:10,977
Mother!

2174
02:43:12,388 --> 02:43:13,446
Mother!

2175
02:43:14,257 --> 02:43:16,213
What is it, Henry? What 's happened?

2176
02:43:18,328 --> 02:43:19,386
She's gone.

2177
02:43:19,596 --> 02:43:21,791
Well, of course, dear. What did you expect

2178
02:43:25,668 --> 02:43:26,794
What am I to do?

2179
02:43:26,936 --> 02:43:28,369
Do without, I suppose.

2180
02:43:30,306 --> 02:43:32,069
And so I shall.

2181
02:43:35,345 --> 02:43:38,337
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up her little lungs...

2182
02:43:38,448 --> 02:43:40,871
let her seek some stufiness that suits her.

2183
02:43:42,018 --> 02:43:45,510
She's an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine.

2184
02:43:45,888 --> 02:43:47,879
Let her go. I can do without her.

2185
02:43:47,957 --> 02:43:50,255
I can do without anyone. I have my own soul!

2186
02:43:50,493 --> 02:43:53,326
My own spark of divine fire!

2187
02:43:57,567 --> 02:43:58,898
Bravo, Eliza

2188
02:44:19,322 --> 02:44:22,485
<i>Damn, damn, damn, damn</i>

2189
02:44:24,827 --> 02:44:26,658
<i>I've grown accustomed to her face</i>

2190
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,495
<i>She almost makes the day begin</i>

2191
02:44:33,970 --> 02:44:37,235
<i>I've grown accustomed to the tune</i> <i>That she whistles night and noon</i>

2192
02:44:37,407 --> 02:44:41,138
<i>Her smiles, her frowns</i> <i>Her ups, her downs</i>

2193
02:44:41,277 --> 02:44:43,006
<i>Are second nature to me now</i>

2194
02:44:44,447 --> 02:44:46,335
<i>Like breathing out and breathing in</i>

2195
02:44:47,817 --> 02:44:51,173
<i>I was serenely independent and content</i> <i>Before we met</i>

2196
02:44:51,788 --> 02:44:54,746
<i>Surely I could always be that way again</i>

2197
02:44:56,893 --> 02:45:00,624
<i>And yet I've grown</i> <i>Accustomed to her looks</i>

2198
02:45:01,564 --> 02:45:03,122
<i>Accustomed to her voice</i>

2199
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:07,666
<i>Accustomed to her face</i>

2200
02:45:22,485 --> 02:45:23,645
Marry Freddy.

2201
02:45:24,387 --> 02:45:28,153
What an infantile idea What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do.

2202
02:45:29,225 --> 02:45:31,921
But she'll regret it She'll regret it

2203
02:45:32,462 --> 02:45:35,124
It's doomed before they even take the vow!

2204
02:45:36,766 --> 02:45:40,463
<i>I can see her now</i> <i>Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill</i>

2205
02:45:40,636 --> 02:45:42,866
<i>In a wretched little flat above a store</i>

2206
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:46,629
<i>I can see her now, not a penny in the till</i>

2207
02:45:46,709 --> 02:45:49,007
<i>And a bill collector beating at the door</i>

2208
02:45:49,812 --> 02:45:52,076
<i>She'll try to teach the things I taught her</i>

2209
02:45:52,715 --> 02:45:54,774
<i>And end up selling flowers instead</i>

2210
02:45:55,752 --> 02:45:57,640
<i>Begging for her bread and water</i>

2211
02:45:58,254 --> 02:46:00,950
<i>While her husband has</i> <i>His breakfast in bed</i>

2212
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:09,020
<i>In a year or so</i> <i>When she's prematurely gray</i>

2213
02:46:09,098 --> 02:46:11,953
<i>And the blossom in her cheek</i> <i>Has turned to chalk</i>

2214
02:46:12,769 --> 02:46:15,966
<i>She'll come home and lo</i> <i>He'll have upped and run away</i>

2215
02:46:16,105 --> 02:46:18,960
<i>With a social-climbing heiress</i> <i>From New York</i>

2216
02:46:19,242 --> 02:46:20,539
<i>Poor Eliza</i>

2217
02:46:20,610 --> 02:46:22,271
<i>How simply frightful</i>

2218
02:46:22,345 --> 02:46:23,937
<i>How humiliating</i>

2219
02:46:24,647 --> 02:46:26,171
<i>How delightful</i>

2220
02:46:28,985 --> 02:46:31,579
<i>How poignant it will be</i> <i>On that inevitable night</i>

2221
02:46:32,054 --> 02:46:34,443
<i>When she hammers on my door</i> <i>In tears and rags</i>

2222
02:46:35,258 --> 02:46:38,352
<i>Miserable and lonely</i> <i>Repentant and contrite</i>

2223
02:46:39,162 --> 02:46:41,494
<i>Will I take her in</i> <i>Or hurl her to the wolves?</i>

2224
02:46:41,764 --> 02:46:44,324
<i>Give her kindness</i> <i>Or the treatment she deserves?</i>

2225
02:46:45,001 --> 02:46:48,232
<i>Will I take her back</i> <i>Or throw the baggage out?</i>

2226
02:46:51,174 --> 02:46:53,005
<i>Well, I'm a most forgiving man</i>

2227
02:46:54,010 --> 02:46:56,570
<i>The sort who never could, ever would</i>

2228
02:46:57,046 --> 02:47:00,140
<i>Take a position</i> <i>and staunchly never budge</i>

2229
02:47:03,786 --> 02:47:05,481
<i>A most forgiving man</i>

2230
02:47:08,758 --> 02:47:10,783
<i>But I shall never take her back</i>

2231
02:47:11,928 --> 02:47:13,725
<i>If she were crawling on her knees</i>

2232
02:47:14,664 --> 02:47:17,326
<i>Let her promise to atone</i> <i>Let her shiver, let her moan</i>

2233
02:47:17,400 --> 02:47:21,063
<i>I'll slam the door</i> <i>And let the hellcat freeze</i>

2234
02:47:24,207 --> 02:47:25,799
Marry Freddy.

2235
02:47:40,723 --> 02:47:42,918
<i>But I'm so used to hear her say</i>

2236
02:47:43,793 --> 02:47:45,454
<i>"Good morning" every day</i>

2237
02:47:46,329 --> 02:47:48,285
<i>Her joys, her woes</i>

2238
02:47:48,965 --> 02:47:51,559
<i>Her highs, her lows</i>

2239
02:47:51,767 --> 02:47:53,758
<i>Are second nature to me now</i>

2240
02:47:55,705 --> 02:47:57,832
<i>Like breathing out and breathing in</i>

2241
02:47:59,809 --> 02:48:03,370
<i>I'm very grateful she's a woman</i> <i>And so easy to forget</i>

2242
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:07,713
<i>Rather like a habit</i> <i>One can always break</i>

2243
02:48:10,486 --> 02:48:14,479
<i>And yet I've grown</i> <i>Accustomed to the trace</i>

2244
02:48:15,491 --> 02:48:18,016
<i>Of something in the air</i>

2245
02:48:19,495 --> 02:48:24,023
<i>Accustomed to her face</i>

2246
02:50:01,697 --> 02:50:06,657
<i>Oh, we are proud. He ain't above</i> <i>givin'lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so.</i>

2247
02:50:07,336 --> 02:50:09,292
<i>I ain't come here to ask</i> <i>for any compliment...</i>

2248
02:50:09,372 --> 02:50:12,170
<i>and if my money's not good enough,</i> <i>I can go elsewhere.</i>

2249
02:50:12,675 --> 02:50:13,903
<i>Good enough for what?</i>

2250
02:50:14,076 --> 02:50:16,567
<i>Good enough for you.</i> <i>Now you know, don'tcha?</i>

2251
02:50:17,079 --> 02:50:19,274
<i>I'm come to 'ave lessons, I am.</i> <i>And to pay for 'em, too...</i>

2252
02:50:19,348 --> 02:50:20,406
<i>make no mistake.</i>

2253
02:50:20,483 --> 02:50:22,246
<i>What is it you want, my girl?</i>

2254
02:50:22,318 --> 02:50:25,708
<i>I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop</i> <i>'stead o' sellin'...</i>

2255
02:50:25,821 --> 02:50:28,016
<i>at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.</i>

2256
02:50:28,324 --> 02:50:32,818
<i>But they won't take me unless I can talk</i> <i>more genteel. He said he could teach me.</i>

2257
02:50:33,562 --> 02:50:38,556
<i>Well, 'ere I am ready to pay, not askin'</i> <i>any favor, and he treats me as if I was dirt.</i>

2258
02:50:39,335 --> 02:50:43,101
<i>I know what lessons cost as well</i> <i>as you do and I'm ready t'pay.</i>

2259
02:50:43,739 --> 02:50:46,572
<i>I won't give more than a shillin'.</i> <i>Take it or leave it.</i>

2260
02:50:47,243 --> 02:50:51,202
<i>It's almost irresistible.</i> <i>She's so deliciously low...</i>

2261
02:50:52,014 --> 02:50:54,608
<i>so horribly dirty. I'll take it.</i>

2262
02:50:55,317 --> 02:50:57,979
<i>I'll make a duchess</i> <i>of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.</i>

2263
02:51:00,322 --> 02:51:02,984
I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did.

2264
02:51:17,740 --> 02:51:19,696
Where the devil are my <i>slippers</i>
