00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:36,991
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go!

3
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,308
Yes! Yes!

4
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,243
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,257
<i>Don't cry.</i>

6
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,861
<i>Don't let 'em
see you cry, Haley.</i>

7
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,097
<i>You will get them next time.</i>

8
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,702
All right?
'Cause what are you?

9
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,340
Huh? What are you?

10
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,675
The apex predator.

11
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,311
Yeah, you are.

12
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,046
Apex predator. All day.

13
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,721
- Hey, what's up?
- <i>Is everything okay?</i>

14
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,089
<i>I've been calling you
all morning.</i>

15
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,426
Sorry.
Late night, early practice.

16
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:48,162
<i>You're having practice during a hurricane?</i>

17
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:53,701
<i>More than one million people now
facing mandatory evacuation orders.</i>

18
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,269
They said it was gonna miss us.

19
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,605
<i>Don't you get alerts
on your phone?</i>

20
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,072
<i>It's gonna hit really hard.</i>

21
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,241
- <i>Louie, honey.</i>
- Hey, bubba. Look at you.

22
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,809
Hi. Hi.

23
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,412
<i>Anyway, Haley, listen.
Have you heard from Dad?</i>

24
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:05,846
No. Why?

25
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,781
<i>Oh, he's not answering my calls.</i>

26
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,717
Well, he probably had
a late night too.

27
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,553
<i>Yeah, I just need to know
he's okay.</i>

28
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,455
<i>They've already evacuated
the whole south coast.</i>

29
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,089
Well, maybe he left already.

30
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,591
<i>Or maybe he's doing
something stupid,</i>

31
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:17,758
<i>like trying to ride it out.</i>

32
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,427
<i>You know what he's like.</i>

33
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,229
Well, what does Mom say?

34
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,298
<i>Mom's in Paris.</i>

35
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,601
Ah, with Prince Charming?

36
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,202
<i>Give her a break.</i>

37
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,638
<i>Dad should've
returned my calls by now.</i>

38
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,105
<i>He always does.</i>

39
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,073
Look, I'll drive down
and check on him.

40
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,843
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>
- 75 South will be empty.

41
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,612
I can be there
in, like, two hours.

42
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,114
<i>I'm not having both of you
down there in a Category 5.</i>

43
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,284
- Then why did you call me?
- <i>Because I thought you might have heard from him.</i>

44
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:44,785
Well, I haven't.

45
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:46,588
Not for a while.

46
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,558
- <i>Did you fight again?</i>
- He fights with me.

47
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,825
<i>Because you're exactly alike.</i>

48
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,094
Yeah, and you're more like Mom.

49
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,697
Empathetic from a safe distance.

50
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,334
<i>Okay, forget it.</i>

51
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,101
- Beth, I gotta go.
- <i>Stay safe.</i>

52
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,736
<i>If you hear from him, text me.</i>

53
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,905
- Okay. I love you.
- <i>Love you too.</i>

54
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,942
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye, little cutie.

55
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,878
<i>...maybe 150 miles per hour.</i>

56
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,715
<i>That is ridiculous.
That can't be true.</i>

57
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,017
<i>I'm telling you,
if you think that's funny, get this.</i>

58
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,620
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- <i>Pasco County</i>

59
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,355
<i>sheriff's office
have warned people</i>

60
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,324
<i>to not shoot guns
into the hurricane.</i>

61
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:24,526
<i>What?
You can't shoot guns in a hurricane?</i>

62
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,960
<i>Well, it's dangerous!</i>

63
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,363
<i>Florida is a stand-your-ground
state after all.</i>

64
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:32,032
<i>Hell yeah, it is!
That's why I'm here.</i>

65
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:39,073
<i>You've reached Dave Keller,
Dave Keller Construction.</i>

66
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,042
<i>Probably up a ladder somewhere,
so please leave a message.</i>

67
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,481
Dad, it's Haley. Call me back.

68
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,750
Beth's worried about you.

69
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,422
Okay.

70
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,292
Oh, man. What a shit show.

71
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:01,895
I swear to God,
if you've already left...

72
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Slow down, slow down.

73
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,612
Sorry, miss, we can't let you...

74
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,481
Haley! What's up?

75
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,948
Hey, Wayne.

76
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,284
How's it going?

77
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:26,120
We've had better days.
The evacuation drives people nuts.

78
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,955
This guy tried to go around.

79
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,290
No hurricane party this year?

80
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:31,760
I don't think so.

81
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,430
Hey, how's your sister? Your old
man says she's living up in Boston.

82
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,197
Yeah. Yeah, she's good.

83
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,867
She actually asked me
to go check on him.

84
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:44,004
Uh, I'm afraid
I can't let you do that.

85
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,073
The storm's turning west
and heading straight for us.

86
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,941
- We're not letting anyone through.
- Come on, Wayne.

87
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,344
He's not answering his phone.

88
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:50,645
Look, I know the roads.

89
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,580
I'll be in and out, I promise.

90
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:59,086
I'm really sorry, Haley.
I wish I could help you out, but I just...

91
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,288
I can't.
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

92
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,058
Okay, I understand.

93
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,661
Maybe you could check on him
later if you get a chance?

94
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,630
- Sure, I'll try.
- Thanks.

95
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:09,997
Drive safe.

96
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,933
Uh, say hi
to your sister for me.

97
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,303
- Sure.
- Okay.

98
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:21,875
Turn around.

99
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:37,592
Fuck it.

100
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,863
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

101
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,967
All roads are closed up ahead.

102
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,737
Uh, come in.

103
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,104
Stop!

104
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,674
Just wait!
Stay where you are.

105
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,109
<i>It looks
like Wendy's now gonna go</i>

106
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,077
<i>right through the middle
of our state.</i>

107
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:01,115
<i>We strongly urge local residents to
listen to all warnings from officials.</i>

108
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,884
<i>If you're in an evacuation zone,
you gotta get out.</i>

109
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,553
<i>You can't wait.</i>

110
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:08,956
<i>We... We won't be able
to come for you.</i>

111
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,394
<i>I hope every parent in the state
is thinking,</i>

112
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,463
<i>"How do I keep my family safe?"</i>

113
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:56,538
Dad?

114
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,148
Dad?

115
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,218
Dad!

116
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,456
Hi. Hey, Sugar.

117
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:15,623
Hey, girl.

118
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,559
Where's Daddy?

119
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,126
I missed you.

120
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,696
Where's Dad, hey?
Where is he?

121
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,196
<i>No sign of
Dad, but Sugar's here.</i>

122
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,232
He wouldn't have gone
without her.

123
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:01,001
It's weird. It's like a ghost town.
Everyone's gone.

124
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,004
<i>Please,
just get yourself somewhere safe,</i>

125
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,307
<i>even if you have to
stop at a shelter.</i>

126
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,343
You think he went
to the old house?

127
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,211
<i>No, I think it's been in
escrow since the divorce.</i>

128
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:14,816
Beth, there's pictures of you,
me, and Mom laid out everywhere.

129
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,720
This condo is horrible.
It's depressing.

130
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:23,023
<i>Haley, you have to stop blaming them.
It was their mutual decision.</i>

131
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,960
Whatever.
I'm gonna check the house.

132
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,061
- <i>No, don't you dare. I'm not hav...</i>
- Hey, I bumped into

133
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,964
your ex-boyfriend Wayne
on the way down.

134
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,766
<i>He was not my boyfriend.</i>

135
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,936
Whatever you say. I still remember
the time Dad caught you guys.

136
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,506
<i>Stop! Oh, my God. How do you remember that?
You were like...</i>

137
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,140
I was eight.

138
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,910
- <i>God.</i>
- Scarred me for life.

139
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,778
<i>I'm never gonna live that down.</i>

140
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:46,079
No. Never ever.

141
00:10:57,892 --> 00:10:59,059
Don't give me that look.

142
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,128
I was gonna visit more.
I just...

143
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,230
got busy.

144
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,833
I'm trying to have
a life of my own, you know.

145
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,168
I love visiting the swamp.

146
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,271
Heat, humidity,

147
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,775
mosquitoes.

148
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:16,311
What's not to like, eh?

149
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,245
Oh, yeah, except you.

150
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,415
My little fur baby.

151
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,576
Oh, thank God.

152
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,794
Come on, Sugar.

153
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,581
Dad!

154
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,392
Hello?

155
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,815
Dad, you here?

156
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,257
Dad?

157
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:25,740
Marco! Polo! Anybody?

158
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,347
Dad!

159
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,788
Dad!

160
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,175
Where is he, girl?

161
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,548
Come on.

162
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,437
Shit.

163
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:57,865
Oh, my God.

164
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:21,856

165
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,432
Shit.

166
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,803
Is he there?
Can you hear him? Dad?

167
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:38,873
Dad? Dad!

168
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:43,911
I gotta go down there, don't I?

169
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:47,782
Okay.

170
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,525
Ah.

171
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,360

175
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,989
Stay here, okay?

176
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,634
Uh!

177
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:10,031

179
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:23,778
Dad?

180
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,481
Aww!

181
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,684
Ugh, shit.

182

Oh, my God.

198
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:27,601
Okay. We need to get to a hospital,
all right? We need to go right now.

Yeah, I know.
We've already met.

216

How'd it even get down here?

217

I don't know.

218
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,964
It must've come through the...

on the lake side.

220
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:32,607
Ohh.
Why did you come here?

221
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:35,844
You're welcome.

Listen to me.

00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:41,181
You need to go. Now.

224
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:44,084
- Not without you.
- I don't need your help.

225
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,759
Ah, ah...

226
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:53,293
Yeah,
I can clearly see that.

227
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:57,599
Wait.

228
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,035
Sugar?

229
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,406
Yeah.
She helped me find you.

230
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,510

231
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,179

232
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,215
What's with the beard?

233
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,951
Oh, it's for
my Internet dating.

234
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,424
What's happening
with the storm?

235
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:26,394
It's pretty bad.
Everyone's gone.

236
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,129
What are you even
doing here?

237
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:31,231
I wanted to board up
some vents.

238
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:34,234
I mean, in this house.
I thought you sold the place.

239
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,704
Deal fell through.

240
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:47,715
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit. What happened?

241
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:53,187
Got tangled up in the pipes
when he tried to drag me.

242
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:56,089
That's how I escaped.

243
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,158
We're okay
on this side of the pipes.

244
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:00,961
It's too big to get back here.

245
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,201
I've gotta go get my phone.

246
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,103
Nobody is coming
in this storm, Haley.

247
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:11,673
I have to try.

248
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,476
I'm getting us out of here.

249
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,009
Okay, okay.

250
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:19,012
Go this way.
It's safer. Okay.

251
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:20,648
You keep your eye on him.

252
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:22,784
They can't hear you
out of the water.

253
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,586
They can see you in the dark.

254
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,188
- They're not as fast out of...
- I know, Dad.

255
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,157
Stay here.

256
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,360
Well,
I thought I'd go for a run.

257
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,544
Dad? Keep talking to me.

258
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,180
How's your split
in the hundred free?

259
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,217
- Really?
- You asked me to talk.

260
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:00,187
We already talked
about the weather.

261
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:02,857
I lost my last relay.

262
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:05,960
- When?
- This morning at practice.

263
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:07,629
By two hundredths.

264
00:27:07,762 --> 00:27:10,331
Two hundredths, that's nothing.
You got that.

265
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,233
You just gotta want it, baby.

266
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:18,071
If I lose my spot on the travel
team, I lose my scholarship.

267
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:22,310
- Maybe I've reached my limit.
- No.

268
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:25,780
I keep telling you, it's not your
body that's holding you back.

269
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:28,449
Because what are you?

270
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,217
You're not my coach anymore,
Dad.

271
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:32,387
That apex-predator shit
doesn't help.

272
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,490
I'm just saying, you could
believe in yourself a little more.

273
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:37,692
Oh, yeah.
Look who's talking.

274
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:40,193
Every athlete
reaches a plateau.

275
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:42,129
- Dad, just stop.
- It's normal.

276
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:44,231
I need to focus, okay?

277
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:47,535
Haley,
just forget about the team.

278
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:51,906
Just remember what got you into
swimming in the first place.

279
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,073
You did.

280
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,779
You're gonna blame me 'cause you have a gift.

281
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,481
And I needed to kick you
in the butt a little.

282
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:03,250
I know you, Haley.

283
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,791
You're not gonna give up now.

284
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,561
You don't know
anything about me.

285
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:26,567
Yes.

286

00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:33,821
Dad! Dad, I see some people!

328
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:36,023
Help! Help!

329
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:42,129
- You check the register?
- Empty.

330
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:47,302
- It's heavy.
- You got it? Wait, wait, wait.

331
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:53,040
- You got it?
- Yeah.

332
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,013
Whoo!
How we gonna open this baby?

333
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:02,683
Who cares? Think of all the shit
we'll get with all this cash.

334
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,755
Maybe it's empty too.

335
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,823
Feels pretty loaded to me.

336
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:11,992
Come on, Stan, time to go!

337
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:29,810
Will you go get your brother?
We have to leave.

338
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:40,788
Come on, Stan!

339
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:46,428
What the fuck
are you doing? Marv!

340
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:49,230
I think there's some
people in that house over there.

341
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:50,931
Help!

342
00:38:55,604 --> 00:38:58,973
Help! Help!

343
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:04,111
Marv! Marv, there's nothing there.
Let's go. You're gonna get shot.

344
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,821
Hey! Hey, we're here!

345
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:15,357
Come on!

346
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:17,157
Please!

347
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:42,049
See, I told you... Fuck!

348
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:50,858
Shit.

349
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:53,827
No!

350
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,497
No!

351
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,846
Stan!

352
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,716
Stan, get out of the water!

353
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,518
Get out of the water, Stan!

354
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:21,389
Stan!

355
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,525
Ah!

356
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,904
Haley? Listen to me.

357
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,408
There's another way out.

358
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:16,176
Go over
to the other access hatch.

359
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:18,278
By the entrance to the house.

360
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:21,483
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

361
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:25,320
Crawl along the foundation
till you reach the wet wall.

362
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,723
They're all wet, Dad.

363
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:30,625
No, listen.

364
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:32,694
It's where all the pipes go up
into the house.

365
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:36,230
But be careful.
You'll be pretty exposed over there.

366
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,566
Okay.

367
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:11,291
Ahh, ahh.

368
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,795
Oh.

369
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:50,565
Hey, Sugar. Hey.

370
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:52,433
Good girl.

371
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:54,101
Hey, girl.

372
00:43:54,602 --> 00:43:56,203
Good girl.

373
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:00,207
Did you find it?

374
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,611
Yeah, it's stuck.

375
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:08,483
There's something on top of it.

376
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,785
Is there a plan B?

377
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:12,687
That was our plan B.

378
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,960
In less than an hour,
this crawl space will be under water.

379
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:21,996
What about
the overflow drainpipe?

380
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,999
No. They came in from there.

381
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:28,570
Come back to this side of the pipes.
We'll figure something out.

382
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:59,299
There's somebody out there.

383
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:14,582
Dad, it's the police!

384
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:16,884
Help! Hello!

385
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,920
- Hey!
- It's Wayne. Help!

386
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:32,132
Stay with the boat.
I'll be right back.

387
00:45:46,514 --> 00:45:47,548
Haley?

388
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:53,688
- Hey, Wayne!
- Wayne!

389
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:57,392
Wayne!

390
00:45:57,892 --> 00:45:58,893
Down here!

391
00:45:59,627 --> 00:46:00,662
Wayne!

392
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:02,897
Hey!

393
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:05,165
Mr. Keller!

394
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,185
Mr. Keller!

395
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,755
Wayne! Wayne!

396
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:29,657
- Wayne!
- Wayne!

397
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,927
Wayne!

398
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:46,007
Wayne!

399
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,575
He's heading to the garage!

400
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:04,585
Haley!

401
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:08,055
Wayne?

402
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:11,259
No, Wayne, wait! Stop!

403
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:13,427
Stop! Wait, don't come down!

404
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:15,496
- No! Stay there!
- Hey!

405
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,666
Wait!
There's two gators down here!

406
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:22,503
Okay, hold on.
Don't move. Hold on!

407
00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:27,308
Come in, Pete.

408
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:29,644
Pete, you copy?

409
00:48:29,777 --> 00:48:31,579
<i>Pete, do you copy?</i>

410
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:36,617
Pete, goddamn it, man.
Where are you?

411
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,953
I need you down here now
with a snare pole!

412
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:42,423
Pete, did you hear that?

413
00:49:07,081 --> 00:49:08,616
Help me!

414
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,552
Haley, help me!

415
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:13,888
Wayne!

416
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,029
Grab my hand!

417
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:04,839
I got you.

418
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:08,843
I couldn't save him.

419
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,052
It's okay. Shh.

420
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:21,489
It's okay.
They can't get in here.

421
00:50:22,056 --> 00:50:23,457
We're safe here.

422
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:27,929
Dad.

423
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:29,096
Okay.

424
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,900
Shh. It's okay.

425
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:34,135
It's okay.

426
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,611
I never thought
it would end like this.

427
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:46,981
We should never have
come back here.

428
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:50,785
Haley, you stay strong.
We're getting out of here.

429
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:04,031
You remember
when you were little,

430
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:08,235
and Beth could hold her breath for the
length of the pool and you couldn't?

431
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,072
I'm not really up for
memory lane right now, Dad.

432
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:14,875
Yeah, well, you got so mad
and you stormed off.

433
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:17,478
Yeah, I was a little jerk.

434
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:20,315
Yeah, well, Haley, that night,

435
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:24,151
I woke up about 2:00 in the morning
'cause I heard something outside.

436
00:51:24,285 --> 00:51:26,421
I thought it was a burglar,
so I snuck down,

437
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:28,457
and I saw you in the pool,

438
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,926
taking your giant breaths
again and again.

439
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:35,196
And you did it, Haley.

440
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:38,866
You figured that shit out
all by yourself.

441
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:45,039
And that's when I knew,
this kid's a fighter.

442
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:50,678
So we may be stubborn,
but we do not give up.

443
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:55,216
You gave up on Mom.

444
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:59,520
Mom was not happy,
and I was selfish,

445
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,423
and I didn't
pay enough attention to her.

446
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:02,857
- Because of me.
- No.

447
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,993
Yes, because you were
always with me.

448
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:10,064
Every weekend at the meets.
On the road away from home.

449
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:13,301
It had nothing to do with you.
Is that what you think?

450
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:24,111
It was you and Beth
that kept us together.

451
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:28,582
When you girls left,
we were just...

452
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:34,021
two lonely people
in a big, empty house.

453
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,758
Nobody to even pretend for.

454
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:43,798
Your mom got a second chance,
Haley, and she deserves to be happy.

455
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:45,933
So do you.

456
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,937
I don't think I deserve one.

457
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,208
I miss you.

458
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:58,212
I miss seeing your face
in the stands when I win.

459
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:00,549
Why don't you come
anymore?

460
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,617
- I thought you were mad at me.
- I am!

461
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:05,820
I know.

462
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:29,110
We are gonna beat
these pea-brained lizard shits.

463
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,112
You and me.

464
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:35,950
They didn't like it
when I was banging on the pipes.

465
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,819
I think I can distract them
if you can dive

466
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:41,590
all the way under
until you get to the stairs.

467
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,691
Yeah, I can do it.

468
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,528
You ready?

469
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,895
Yeah.

470
00:53:48,597 --> 00:53:50,532
I'm coming back for you, okay?

471
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:52,233
You'd better.

472
00:53:54,668 --> 00:53:55,903
Okay.

473
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,002
Okay.

474
00:54:48,356 --> 00:54:49,457
Go.

475
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,141
Ahh!

476
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:11,433
Dad?

477
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,501
I can't make it to the stairs.

478
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,640
I'm going for the drainpipe,
okay?

479
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:20,240
No.

480
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:22,410
It's too dangerous.

481
00:57:24,312 --> 00:57:25,447
You hear me?

482
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,084
Haley?

483
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:16,531
Oh.

484
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,921
Oh, shit.

485
01:00:20,655 --> 01:00:22,089
Ah!

486
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,729
Haley!

487
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:44,111
Haley! Answer me!

488
01:00:45,914 --> 01:00:47,448
I killed one.

489
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:31,719
Haley? Hey.

490
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:39,787
Ah!

491
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:48,463
Hey!

492
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,866
We're over here! Help!

493
01:03:53,868 --> 01:03:56,637
Haley?

494
01:04:15,723 --> 01:04:16,891
Dad!

495
01:04:21,863 --> 01:04:23,831
Haley! Help!

496
01:04:26,334 --> 01:04:27,802
Haley!

497
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:56,831
Dad, I'm coming!

498
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:22,890
No!

499
01:05:23,024 --> 01:05:24,358
No.

500
01:05:24,492 --> 01:05:28,062
One, two, three, four.

501
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:33,000
Come on! Wake up!

502
01:05:33,134 --> 01:05:34,468
No.

503
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,309
Come on. Four, five, six.

504
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:42,510
Don't quit on me, Daddy,
come on!

505
01:05:42,643 --> 01:05:46,848
One, two, three, four.

506
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:50,718
No, no, no!

507
01:05:53,322 --> 01:05:55,089
Come on, Daddy, wake up!

508
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:59,293
Come on!

509
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:04,966
Yes, Daddy, yes! Yes!

510
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:10,104
Yes, yes, yes!

511
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,942
- You're okay. You're okay.
- Oh, God.

512
01:06:28,222 --> 01:06:29,423
Hey, Sugar.

513
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:33,160
Okay, Sugar. It's okay.

514
01:06:34,462 --> 01:06:37,965
Come on. Let's get to the car.

515
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,109
Oh, shit.

516
01:06:49,277 --> 01:06:50,511
No way!

517
01:06:55,116 --> 01:06:56,751
Dad, what do we do?

518
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:05,459
Boat! You see over there?

519
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:08,796
No, there are too many of 'em.
We need to stay here.

520
01:07:09,497 --> 01:07:10,665
No, those levees
are gonna break,

521
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:13,034
and when they do
we can't be here.

522
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:15,536
That boat's
our only chance to leave.

523
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,538
I think we can make it.

524
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,107
It's impossible.

525
01:07:22,043 --> 01:07:25,212
They gather in the floodwaters
'cause it's easier to hunt.

526
01:07:25,347 --> 01:07:27,349
They hunt what splashes.

527
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:30,952
So no splashing, no hunting.

528
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:34,789
I think
the rain should cover us.

529
01:07:34,922 --> 01:07:35,957
Okay.

530
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:39,927
Come on, girl.

531
01:07:41,363 --> 01:07:43,998
It's okay. All right.

532
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:54,001
The eye is above us.

533
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:06,180
We'd better hurry.

534
01:09:07,548 --> 01:09:08,983
Ohh.

535
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:12,653
Don't move.

536
01:09:29,203 --> 01:09:30,704
Levees just broke!

537
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:33,774
Haley, you need to swim.

538
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:38,513
You got this!
You're faster than they are!

539
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:40,348
What are you?

540
01:09:41,182 --> 01:09:42,317
Swim!

541
01:10:16,217 --> 01:10:17,618
Whoo!

542
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:21,155
Apex predator all day!

543
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:31,399
Come on!

544
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,677
- Hold on!
- Get down!

545
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:14,008
- Dad! Dad!
- Take my hand!

546
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:17,978
Help!

547
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:22,216
- Haley!
- No! No!

548
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:54,848
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

549
01:12:00,689 --> 01:12:02,923
Dad! Where are you?

550
01:12:03,924 --> 01:12:05,159
Haley!

551
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,495
I'm here!

552
01:12:09,296 --> 01:12:10,465
Oh.

553
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:44,898
Hey!

554
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:47,335
Meet me at the stairs.

555
01:13:19,401 --> 01:13:21,168
Oh! Ohh!

556
01:14:49,923 --> 01:14:52,926
Hello? Hello.
Can anybody hear me?

557
01:14:54,596 --> 01:14:57,097
Yes! Yes, hello!

558
01:14:57,231 --> 01:15:00,200
I'm trapped with my father
in our house in Coral Lake.

559
01:15:00,635 --> 01:15:02,102
It's flooded.

560
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:04,439
There's alligators everywhere.

561
01:15:04,873 --> 01:15:06,341
Please send help.

562
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,810
Please, can you hear me?

563
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,212
No, come on!

564
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,104
Sugar?

565
01:15:40,842 --> 01:15:43,243
Come on. Come here, girl.

566
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:45,513
Come on.

567
01:15:51,185 --> 01:15:52,953
Good girl.

568
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,557
Good girl.

569
01:15:57,358 --> 01:15:58,326
Haley!

570
01:16:10,705 --> 01:16:11,739
Dad!

571
01:16:13,441 --> 01:16:14,476
Dad!

572
01:16:25,687 --> 01:16:26,788
Dad!

573
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:29,122
- Dad!
- Go!

574
01:16:29,524 --> 01:16:30,592
Go!

575
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:37,565
Swim!

576
01:17:35,957 --> 01:17:37,525
Come on, you son of a bitch!

577
01:17:55,543 --> 01:17:58,313
Come on, we gotta
get to the roof. Come on.

578
01:18:00,715 --> 01:18:02,115
Come on, we gotta go.

579
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:04,686
Keep the pressure on your arm.

580
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:07,087
Stay with me!

581
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:22,770
- The house made it after all.
- Yeah, she's a strong one.

582
01:18:22,904 --> 01:18:24,137
Come on.

583
01:18:26,975 --> 01:18:29,344
I lied to you
about the deal.

584
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:33,280
I just couldn't sign the papers.

585
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:36,116
- I don't want to sell.
- It doesn't matter, Dad.

586
01:18:36,249 --> 01:18:40,088
- It's just a house.
- It's not just a house. It's our home.

587
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,557
The last place we were a family.

588
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,459
This house isn't our home.

589
01:18:44,993 --> 01:18:47,762
Me and you, that's home.

590
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:50,398
- Come on. You okay?
- Yeah.

591
01:18:52,533 --> 01:18:54,402
- Did you see that?
- What?

592
01:18:55,003 --> 01:18:56,738
It's the rescue helicopter.

593
01:18:56,871 --> 01:18:58,306
All right, go. Hurry!

594
01:19:03,243 --> 01:19:05,847
Here! We're here!

595
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,214
Help!

596
01:19:08,383 --> 01:19:09,651
Do they see it?

597
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:11,452
Come on!

598
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:19,594
Haley!

599
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:25,066
You okay?

600
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:27,301
Dad, get to the roof!

601
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:29,771
- Okay.
- I see a way out!

602
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:54,756
Ah!

603
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:01,362
Ah!

604
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:18,045
Ahh!

605
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:10,531
Wha...

606
01:25:17,383 --> 01:25:22,383
