1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:15,468


2
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,699
Oh, God.

3
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,812
Do not Cry.

4
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,789
Don't let them see you crying here.

5
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,349
You will beat them next time.

6
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,355
Okay, who are you?

7
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,167
Huh. Who are you?

8
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,761
Peak predator

9
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,870
Predator tops forever.

10
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,782
Hey, how are you?

11
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,218
Is everything ok
I called you all morning

12
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,453
Sorry, I stayed up late, I practiced.

13
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,657
Do you practice? During a storm?

14
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,792
More than one million people ...

15
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,562
... now required to be evacuated.

16
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,364
No, he said we will pass that

17
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,599
Don't you get it
notification on your phone.

18
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,828
It will hit hard

19
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,870
What a shame
- Hey honey, it looks new.

20
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,206
Haley, listen, have you called father?

21
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,810
No problem?
- He didn't answer my call.

22
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,712
He might watch late at night.

23
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,180
Yes, I just want to know
is he alright

24
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,274
They have evacuated
the whole south coast.

25
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,251
Maybe he's gone.

26
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,752
Maybe he did something stupid.

27
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,278
Like trying to survive past it,
You know what he looks like, right?

28
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,991
What do you say mom?

29
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,193
Mother in Paris.

30
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,562
Oh, prince is handsome?

31
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,563
Love him a chance.

32
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:48,299
Are you crazy?
- 75 South will be empty.

33
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:49,934
I can get there in 2 hours.

34
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,036
I don't want you two
there during a storm in category 5.

35
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,438
Then why did you call me.

36
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:55,407
Because I thought you heard from him.

37
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:59,477
I have no news, it's been a while.

38
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:03,981
Are you fighting again?
- He quarreled with me.
- Because you are similar.

39
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,584
Yes. You look more like mom.

40
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,348
Sad from a safe distance.

41
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,756
Okay, forget it.

42
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,957
Beth, I have to go.

43
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:14,792
If you hear him, text me.

44
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,695
I'll text, I love you.
- I love you too.

45
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,426
Hi.
- Hello, beautiful.

46
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:27,305
I had expected it couldn't be true.

47
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:29,974
Damn, you think it's funny.
- yes.

48
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:35,313
Sheriff's office, people don't shoot guns into storms.
- What!

49
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:37,715
Can't shoot into a storm.
- That's dangerous.

50
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:40,708
What's the danger?
- You should avoid it.

51
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:45,454
It would be nice here.

52
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:51,462
You contact Dave Kaller
from the construction of Dave Kaller.

53
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,897
Maybe I'm on the stairs somewhere,
so please leave a message.

54
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,426
Daddy, this is Haley, call me back.

55
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,931
Beth is worried about you.

56
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,309
Hey...

57
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:10,347
Yes, it's very chaotic.

58
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:14,048
I swear to God, if not ... I've left.

59
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,521
Wow, wow, wow, slow down.

60
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:29,231
Sorry miss, we can't let ...

61
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,761
Haley, what's wrong?
- Hi Wayne.

62
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:34,805
How are you.

63
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:38,442
There are better days,
this evacuation makes people crazy.

64
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,944
This is getting worse.

65
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:44,048
There is no storm party this year.
- I do not think so.

66
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:48,884
How is your sister? Your father said he lived in Boston.
- Yes, he is indeed there.

67
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,356
He actually asked me
to examine him.

68
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,427
I can't let you do that.

69
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,430
The storm headed south, and headed straight
to us, we don't let anyone pass.

70
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,365
Come on Wayne, he doesn't answer the phone.

71
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:05,335
I know the route, I'll be out in an hour, promise.

72
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:11,375
I'm really sorry Haley, but I ...

73
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,640
I can't, I don't want you to get hurt.

74
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,781
Okay, I understand, maybe ...

75
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,950
... can you check him later, if there is a chance?

76
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,079
Of course, I'll try.
- Thank you.
- Drive carefully.

77
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:54,917
Say hi to your sister for me.

78
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:57,685
Certain.
- OK

79
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,472
Hell of it.

80
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:25,476
Hey ... hey, stop!

81
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:29,223
You have to go back.

82
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:32,827
Uh, come in.

83
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:35,429
Wait, stay at your place.

84
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,593
It looks like a storm is heading
directly to our state.

85
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:43,371
Recommended for local residents
listen to all the warnings.

86
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,673
Evacuation is one
only way to get out.

87
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:48,876
You can't wait.

88
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,845
We will not be able to come for you.

89
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:54,849
I don't think anyone will stay.

90
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:58,149
There is no other way to be safe.

91
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:37,247
Father!

92
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:49,237
Father!

93
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,304
Father!

94
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,142
Hey

95
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:59,213
Oh sweet, where is daddy?

96
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:02,250
You miss me?
Where is dad?

97
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,345
Where is she?

98
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:39,552
There is no sign from father,
but Sugar is here, he won't leave without him.

99
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,220
Strange, like a ghost town,
everyone left.

100
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,626
Please ... You go to a safe place,
even though it must go to a shelter.

101
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:50,524
Do you think he went home long?

102
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,763
I think that includes
in the divorce agreement.

103
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,633
There is a picture of you, a picture of me 
and mother lying everywhere.

104
00:10:57,672 --> 00:11:00,775
I know, it's horrible, and depressed.

105
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,277
Haley ... you have to stop blaming them.

106
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,579
That was their joint decision.

107
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,581
Whatever, I'll check the house.

108
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:11,852
No, don't you dare ...
- I met your ex Wayne when he was here.

109
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:14,922
He is not my girlfriend.
- Whatever you say.

110
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,558
I still remember when I caught you guys.
- stop.

111
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:20,995
Oh God, how do you remember that, you're around ...
-I am 8 years old at that time.

112
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:25,566
Oh, God.
- I'll remember it for life.
- Can't you forget that?

113
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,398
No, never will.

114
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,550
Don't give me that look,
I will visit, only ...

115
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,252
You will be busy.

116
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,721
I will have my own life, you know.

117
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:49,923
I like to visit swamps.

118
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:55,291
Bookworm, quiet, lots of mosquitoes.

119
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:58,933
Nothing like here.
- Oh, yes.

120
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:02,199
Except for him, my dear sister.

121
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:30,260
Thank God.

122
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:48,612
Come on ... Sugar.

123
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:09,499
Father!

124
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,571
Hello!

125
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,465
Your dad here?

126
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:51,745
Father!

127
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,562
Marco! Polo! Anyone.

128
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,971
Father!

129
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,662
Where is she.

130
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:18,717
Youre here. Father? Father!

131
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:20,419
Father!

132
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:24,957
I should go down there right.

133
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:40,871
It is okay.

134
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,308
It's cold.

135
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,386
Men always do it.

136
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:56,763
Father!

137
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,702
Wait here okay?

138
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:52,917
Hang on daddy!

139
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:55,555
Father!

140
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:05,223
Father!

141
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,711
Father!

142
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,862
God damn it.

143
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:41,594
I know you will come down here during a storm.

144
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,561
Father!

145
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,441
Father!

146
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,444
Father! Not. Shit!

147
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:45,762
Shit. Father.

148
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,811
Okay, you're still breathing.

149
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,881
What happened, dad?

150
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:03,146
Oh, God.

151
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:07,387
Okay, we have to take you
to the hospital, okay?

152
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:09,322
We will get you out of here.

153
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:19,266
Not.

154
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:24,387
Window to resist the storm.

155
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,388
We almost got there ... father.

156
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:50,857
Oh, God.

157
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:21,311
Not! Not!

158
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,216
Beth.

159
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:06,518
Beth.

160
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:10,795
Haley ...

161
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,932
Come on

162
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,764
Wake me up.

163
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:48,563
Caution.

164
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:52,405
Do you know?
- Yes I know.

165
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:54,207
We have met.

166
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,767
How can you go down here.

167
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:04,448
Come to me...

168
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:09,222
To the old place across the lake.

169
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:14,226
Oh, why are you here.

170
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:16,387
Thank you again.

171
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,532
Listen to me, listen to me.

172
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:21,968
You have to go now.

173
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:25,427
Not without you.
- I don't need your help.

174
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:34,378
I clearly see it.

175
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:45,451
This, he helped me find you.

176
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:49,656
You again.

177
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:53,467
You look bad.
- Huh.

178
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,935
Is it because of a bear?

179
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,664
Oh, this is from my internet date.

180
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:03,207
Suddenly there was this storm.

181
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:07,747
He will come back, everyone is gone.

182
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:10,617
What are you doing here.

183
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:14,645
I want to make a fence.
I mean at home, I think you sell this place.

184
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:18,620
The agreement failed.

185
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,268
What happened?

186
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:34,307
I tripped over the pipe when
he tried to drag me.

187
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:36,977
So I ran away.

188
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,276
I'm okay on this side.

189
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:42,549
Too big to come here.

190
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,321
I have to go get my call.

191
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:52,759
No one will come in this storm.
- I have to try.

192
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,253
We will leave here.

193
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,799
Promise me, save him.

194
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:03,359
You watch him, he can't hear you in the water.

195
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:05,538
He saw you in the dark.

196
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,303
But not fast on land.
- I know it.

197
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:11,310
Stay here.

198
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,438
I think I'll run.

199
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,794
Daddy, keep talking to me.

200
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,795
I just broke 003.

201
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:38,730
Really?
- You want me to keep talking.

202
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,001
I talked.

203
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,310
I lost mine.

204
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,109
Explain it.
- This morning, during practice.

205
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:51,743
200 is nothing, you have a father.

206
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:54,987
You just need to do it dear.

207
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:59,118
I lost my place on the team, I lost my scholarship.

208
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:03,661
Maybe I have reached my limit.
- Not.

209
00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:06,862
I keep saying no
your body is blocking you.

210
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:09,335
But who are you?

211
00:28:09,335 --> 00:28:11,404
You're not my coach anymore, dad.

212
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:13,840
Crap the top predator doesn't help.

213
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,877
I just said, you can trust yourself more.
- Oh, yes?

214
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,445
See who is talking.

215
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:23,109
Every athlete reaches ...
- Daddy, stop!

216
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:25,776
I want you to focus, okay?

217
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:29,322
Haley, forget the team.
- yes.

218
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,957
remember?

219
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:34,951
Who made you swim first?
- You are.

220
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:39,265
Will you blame me because you have talent?

221
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:42,335
It's not easy for that.

222
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,270
I know you are Haley.

223
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:50,936
You will not give up now.

224
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:54,180
You don't know anything about me.

225
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,316
Hey!

226
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:00,236
Haley!

227
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:05,962
Father!

228
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:09,231
They have two.

229
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,665
Are you hurt?

230
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,038
I am fine.

231
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,470
You don't sound fine.

232
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:25,478
I'm safe.

233
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:45,057
National weather service has
issue a warning ...

234
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:49,128
... for all residents
south and west Florida.

235
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:50,496
All residents ...

236
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,694
... must avoid all those areas.
- Seriously.

237
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,233
Father?
- yes.

238
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,673
Can you see them.

239
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,443
Hold on.

240
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,347
Where are they?

241
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:14,420
I will go into the house.

242
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,455
See if I can get help.

243
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:19,391
I heard something
move past this ladder.

244
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:23,458
I think they are still there.

245
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:14,473
Father, there is someone there!

246
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:16,442
Please! Please!

247
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:28,112
Well, we continue.

248
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:39,765
Do you want to hold this?

249
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:43,065
Okay, we will get all the money.

250
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:48,173
If you say that ...

251
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,742
This is full.

252
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,234
Come on, time to go!

253
00:39:07,192 --> 00:39:09,889
You text your sister, she must go.

254
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:21,306
Come on Sam!

255
00:39:24,376 --> 00:39:26,411
What are you doing?

256
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,882
Come on
- I think someone is home there.

257
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:31,373
Please!

258
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:37,881
Please!

259
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,791
Please!
- Come on!

260
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:44,386
Come on, there's nothing there,
Come on, we will get stuck.

261
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:54,273
Hey, this way!

262
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:56,241
Come on!

263
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:58,233
Please!

264
00:40:19,932 --> 00:40:22,367
I told you

265
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,970
Please!

266
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:35,904
Please!

267
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,026
Maybe he is out.

268
00:41:54,026 --> 00:41:56,257
Go to another room.

269
00:41:56,695 --> 00:41:58,857
On the way home.

270
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:01,831
Do you hear me?
- yes.

271
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,798
Crawling under the foundation
until you reach it.

272
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,842
We all wet daddy.
- Did not hear...

273
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,345
Follow the pipe into the house.

274
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:16,679
Be careful, it's a bit dangerous there.

275
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:19,214
Okay.

276
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:30,177
Sugar.

277
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:34,147
Good boy.

278
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,391
You found it.

279
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:43,495
Stuck ...

280
00:44:46,865 --> 00:44:48,967
There is something above it.

281
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,069
Is there a plan B?

282
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:54,938
That's our plan B.

283
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,670
In less than an hour, this place will be under water.

284
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:03,381
How about another pipe?
- Not.

285
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:05,077
They entered from there.

286
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,946
Back to the end of this pipe,
we think of something else

287
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:39,351
Maybe out there.

288
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:54,425
That's the police!

289
00:45:54,866 --> 00:45:56,234
Please!

290
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:58,270
Please!
- Hey!

291
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,305
Hey!

292
00:46:00,305 --> 00:46:03,673
Please!

293
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:12,680
Stay on board, I'll be back soon.

294
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:27,732
Haley!

295
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:34,099
Hey!

296
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:40,404
Down here!

297
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:44,908
Mr. Kellar!

298
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:07,939
Mr. Kellar!
- Wayne! Wayne!

299
00:47:07,939 --> 00:47:10,340
Wayne!

300
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:13,069
Hey!

301
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:27,826
Wayne!
- He headed there.

302
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:44,202
Haley!

303
00:48:46,438 --> 00:48:48,430
Wayne?

304
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,376
No, Wayne, stop!

305
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:54,646
Stop! Don't go down!

306
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:57,946
Hey.
- There are two crocodiles down there.

307
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:02,945
Okay, hold on, don't move, hold on!

308
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:06,149
Enter Pete.

309
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:09,785
Do you hear Pete?

310
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:18,864
Pete, damn where are you.
I need you here now.

311
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:21,829
Pete, you hear that.

312
00:49:31,249 --> 00:49:34,083
What happened down there.

313
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,393
Haley!

314
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:01,372
Hold my hand!

315
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:44,679
I got you!

316
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,151
I can save him.

317
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,824
It is okay.

318
00:50:59,003 --> 00:51:01,873
It is okay. They can't enter here.

319
00:51:01,873 --> 00:51:03,068
You're safe.

320
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,075
It is okay.

321
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,382
Shh, it's okay.

322
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,754
I never thought I'd do this.

323
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:26,931
Obviously I'm not going back here.

324
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:29,025
You are still strong.

325
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,092
We will get them later.

326
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:43,173
Do you remember when you were little?

327
00:51:43,848 --> 00:51:47,410
The best can hold their breath in the pool,
and you can't ...

328
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:49,887
Yes.

329
00:51:50,054 --> 00:51:53,424
I remember daddy.
- Yes, you got very angry.

330
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:57,054
And you go berserk.
- yes.

331
00:51:57,228 --> 00:51:59,823
Yes, Haley that night.

332
00:52:00,265 --> 00:52:02,700
I wake up at 2 in the morning.

333
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,337
Because I heard something outside, 
I thought there was a thief.

334
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:10,108
When I see you in the pool draw your strongest breath.

335
00:52:10,108 --> 00:52:12,236
Again and again.

336
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:15,436
And you succeed, Haley.

337
00:52:15,813 --> 00:52:18,442
You know in your own way.

338
00:52:20,852 --> 00:52:22,887
lt's ... it's time I know.

339
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:25,083
This kid is a fighter.

340
00:52:27,158 --> 00:52:30,720
So we might be stubborn,
but we don't give up.

341
00:52:33,131 --> 00:52:34,963
You give up with mom.

342
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:39,237
I'm not happy and I'm selfish.

343
00:52:39,237 --> 00:52:42,340
And I don't pay too much attention to him.
- That's because of me.

344
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,105
Not.
- yes. Because you are always with me.

345
00:52:45,777 --> 00:52:48,246
Every weekend, only with me.

346
00:52:48,246 --> 00:52:50,114
Outside ... away from home.

347
00:52:50,114 --> 00:52:53,050
It has nothing to do with you,
what is that what you think.

348
00:53:00,892 --> 00:53:04,124
That's you and Beth
unite us together.

349
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:08,131
When you leave, it's just ...

350
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:13,398
Two lonely people in a big house.

351
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:17,675
Nobody even pretends to be.

352
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,079
Your mother has a chance.

353
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:24,015
Haley, he deserves to be happy.

354
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:25,409
You too.

355
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:29,784
I don't think I deserve it.

356
00:53:31,856 --> 00:53:33,791
I miss you.

357
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:38,087
I miss your face when I win.

358
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:40,898
Why aren't you coming again?

359
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:43,458
I thought you were mad at me.
- indeed.

360
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:47,269
I know..

361
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:08,687
We'll beat this damn lizard.

362
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,824
You and me.

363
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,857
They don't like it when I hit the pipe.

364
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:20,138
I think I can divert them
and you can dive down.

365
00:54:20,138 --> 00:54:23,370
Until you arrive at the stairs.
- Yes, I can do it.

366
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:25,875
Okay?

367
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:30,014
I'll be back for you, okay?

368
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:31,880
You'd better be.

369
00:54:33,985 --> 00:54:35,715
Okay.

370
00:57:49,313 --> 00:57:50,804
Father!

371
00:57:51,082 --> 00:57:53,677
I can't get to the stairs.

372
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,914
I'm going to the drain ... okay?

373
00:58:00,424 --> 00:58:02,017
Come back.

374
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:20,718
Not!

375
01:01:21,759 --> 01:01:23,785
Reply me!

376
01:01:25,062 --> 01:01:27,122
I killed one.

377
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,234
Hey.

378
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:22,105
Please!

379
01:04:28,112 --> 01:04:30,946
Please!

380
01:04:32,883 --> 01:04:34,249
Haley!

381
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:36,780
Daddy, I'm coming!

383
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,972
One two three four.

384
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:12,815
Come on! Get up!

385
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,854
Come on!

386
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:23,193
Don't give up on me father! Come on!
One two...

387
01:06:23,193 --> 01:06:25,958
Three, four.

388
01:06:27,264 --> 01:06:29,392
Not! Not! Not!

389
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:34,063
Come on daddy, wake up!

390
01:06:35,873 --> 01:06:37,739
Come on!

391
01:06:41,211 --> 01:06:43,305
Father!

392
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:49,785
a
Yes, yes!

393
01:06:51,288 --> 01:06:53,985
Oh God, you're fine.

394
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:10,300
Thank you, it's okay.

395
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,767
It is okay.

396
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:18,313
Come on to the car.

397
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:27,314
Oh shit.

398
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:29,015
Impossible!

399
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:36,331
Daddy, what are you doing?

400
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,708
You are there.

401
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:48,245
No, too many of them,
we have to stay here.

402
01:07:48,245 --> 01:07:51,306
This will be destroyed, at that time we can't be here.

403
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:55,883
The boat, I think we can get there.

404
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,986
Impossible.

405
01:08:00,824 --> 01:08:05,262
They gather because of the flood,
they are here to hunt.

406
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:08,298
So do it.

407
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:10,290
Hunt.

408
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:13,767
I think rain will cover us.

409
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:33,282
Above us.

410
01:09:43,026 --> 01:09:45,052
We should be fast.

411
01:10:13,724 --> 01:10:15,792
You can do this.

412
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,694
Back.

413
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:19,396
Where are you!

414
01:10:19,396 --> 01:10:20,830
Swim!

415
01:10:57,834 --> 01:10:59,325
The top predator huh?

416
01:11:08,512 --> 01:11:10,174
Come on!

417
01:11:50,387 --> 01:11:52,879
Father! Not!

418
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:33,693
You must be kidding.

419
01:12:39,102 --> 01:12:41,936
Father! Where are you?

420
01:12:42,372 --> 01:12:45,774
Hold on! I am here!

421
01:13:23,513 --> 01:13:26,210
Meet me on the stairs.

422
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:29,112
Come on

423
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:07,456
Father!

424
01:15:28,338 --> 01:15:31,508
Hello, hello, does anyone hear me?

425
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:33,710
This is the center, what's your condition?
- yes.

426
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,712
Yes, hello.

427
01:15:35,712 --> 01:15:38,477
I'm stuck in a house near the lake.

428
01:15:38,915 --> 01:15:40,784
Flood.

429
01:15:40,784 --> 01:15:43,119
There are crocodiles everywhere.

430
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:45,422
Please send help.

431
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:48,221
Please, you hear me

432
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:51,728
No, come on!

433
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:23,894
Come on

434
01:16:35,705 --> 01:16:36,764
Where are you?

435
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:50,446
Father!

436
01:16:51,855 --> 01:16:52,845
Father!

437
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:04,992
Father.

438
01:17:05,135 --> 01:17:06,103
Father!

439
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,942
Swim!

440
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:16,332
Come on, you fucker!

441
01:18:33,356 --> 01:18:36,258
Come on, we have to go to the roof, come on!

442
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:43,165
Keep pressing.

443
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,968
Stay with me.

444
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,782
Is it safe?
- yes.

445
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:02,946
Come on, here.

446
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:07,250
I lied to you, about the agreement.

447
01:19:09,759 --> 01:19:12,962
I can't sign the letter, I don't want to sell.

448
01:19:12,962 --> 01:19:15,761
It's not a matter of father, it's just home.

449
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:18,868
It's not just a house, it's our home.

450
01:19:18,868 --> 01:19:20,937
The last place we become a family.

451
01:19:20,937 --> 01:19:23,873
The place is not home, the house is between you and me.

452
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:27,210
That's just home, come on.

453
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,974
You ok
- yes.

454
01:19:30,213 --> 01:19:33,016
You see that.

455
01:19:33,016 --> 01:19:36,350
That's the helicopter.
- Hurry up.

456
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,460
Please! We're here!

457
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,156
Please!

458
01:19:46,329 --> 01:19:47,797
Do you see it?

459
01:19:48,031 --> 01:19:49,897
Come on!

460
01:19:56,172 --> 01:19:57,231
Haley!

461
01:20:01,045 --> 01:20:04,180
You are okay?
- yes.

462
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,815
Go upstairs.

463
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:09,616
It is okay.
- I feel it.

464
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,163
Not!

465
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:38,160
Come on!

466
01:23:23,913 --> 01:23:25,745
Not!

467
01:23:25,769 --> 01:23:37,769
