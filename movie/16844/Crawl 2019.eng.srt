

2
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,991
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go!

3
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,308
Yes! Yes!

4
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,243
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,257
<i>Don't cry.</i>

6
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,861
<i>Don't let 'em
see you cry, Haley.</i>

7
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,097
<i>You will get them next time.</i>

8
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,702
All right?
'Cause what are you?

9
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,340
Huh? What are you?

10
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,675
The apex predator.

11
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,311
Yeah, you are.

12
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,046
Apex predator. All day.

13
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,721
- Hey, what's up?
- <i>Is everything okay?</i>

14
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,175
<i>I've been calling you
all morning.</i>

15
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,426
Sorry.
Late night, early practice.

16
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:47,162
<i>You're having practice during a hurricane?</i>

17
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:52,701
<i>More than one million people now
facing mandatory evacuation orders.</i>

18
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,269
They said it was gonna miss us.

19
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:55,713
<i>Don't you get alerts
on your phone?</i>

20
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,072
<i>It's gonna hit really hard.</i>

21
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,241
- <i>Louie, honey.</i>
- Hey, bubba. Look at you.

22
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,809
Hi. Hi.

23
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,412
<i>Anyway, Haley, listen.
Have you heard from Dad?</i>

24
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:04,846
No. Why?

25
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,781
<i>Oh, he's not answering my calls.</i>

26
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,717
Well, he probably had
a late night too.

27
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,553
<i>Yeah, I just need to know
he's okay.</i>

28
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,564
<i>They've already evacuated
the whole south coast.</i>

29
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:14,089
Well, maybe he left already.

30
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:15,662
<i>Or maybe he's doing
something stupid,</i>

31
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:16,804
<i>like trying to ride it out.</i>

32
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,427
<i>You know what he's like.</i>

33
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,229
Well, what does Mom say?

34
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,298
<i>Mom's in Paris.</i>

35
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,601
Ah, with Prince Charming?

36
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,202
<i>Give her a break.</i>

37
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,746
<i>Dad should've
returned my calls by now.</i>

38
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,105
<i>He always does.</i>

39
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,073
Look, I'll drive down
and check on him.

40
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,843
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>
- 75 South will be empty.

41
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,612
I can be there
in, like, two hours.

42
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:39,114
<i>I'm not having both of you
down there in a Category 5.</i>

43
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:42,327
- Then why did you call me?
- <i>Because I thought you might have heard from him.</i>

44
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,785
Well, I haven't.

45
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,588
Not for a while.

46
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:48,558
- <i>Did you fight again?</i>
- He fights with me.

47
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,825
<i>Because you're exactly alike.</i>

48
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,094
Yeah, and you're more like Mom.

49
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:55,697
Empathetic from a safe distance.

50
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,334
<i>Okay, forget it.</i>

51
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,101
- Beth, I gotta go.
- <i>Stay safe.</i>

52
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:01,736
<i>If you hear from him, text me.</i>

53
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,905
- Okay. I love you.
- <i>Love you too.</i>

54
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,942
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye, little cutie.

55
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:09,878
<i>...maybe 150 miles per hour.</i>

56
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,715
<i>That is ridiculous.
That can't be true.</i>

57
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,127
<i>I'm telling you,
if you think that's funny, get this.</i>

58
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,711
<i>- Go ahead.
- Pasco County</i>

59
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,355
<i>sheriff's office
have warned people</i>

60
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,324
<i>to not shoot guns
into the hurricane.</i>

61
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,526
<i>What?
You can't shoot guns in a hurricane?</i>

62
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,960
<i>Well, it's dangerous!</i>

63
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,363
<i>Florida is a stand-your-ground
state after all.</i>

64
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:31,032
<i>Hell yeah, it is!
That's why I'm here.</i>

65
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:38,073
<i>You've reached Dave Keller,
Dave Keller Construction.</i>

66
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:41,042
<i>Probably up a ladder somewhere,
so please leave a message.</i>

67
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:45,481
Dad, it's Haley. Call me back.

68
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,750
Beth's worried about you.

69
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,422
Okay.

70
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:57,292
Oh, man. What a shit show.

71
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:00,895
I swear to God,
if you've already left...

72
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Slow down, slow down.

73
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,612
Sorry, miss, we can't let you...

74
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,481
Haley! What's up?

75
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:19,948
Hey, Wayne.

76
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,284
How's it going?

77
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:25,120
We've had better days.
The evacuation drives people nuts.

78
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,955
This guy tried to go around.

79
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,290
No hurricane party this year?

80
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:30,760
I don't think so.

81
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:34,430
Hey, how's your sister? Your old
man says she's living up in Boston.

82
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:36,197
Yeah. Yeah, she's good.

83
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,867
She actually asked me
to go check on him.

84
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:43,004
Uh, I'm afraid
I can't let you do that.

85
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,182
The storm's turning west
and heading straight for us.

86
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,051
- We're not letting anyone through.
- Come on, Wayne.

87
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,344
He's not answering his phone.

88
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:49,645
Look, I know the roads.

89
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,580
I'll be in and out, I promise.

90
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:58,086
I'm really sorry, Haley.
I wish I could help you out, but I just...

91
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,288
I can't.
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

92
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:03,058
Okay, I understand.

93
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:05,661
Maybe you could check on him
later if you get a chance?

94
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:07,630
- Sure, I'll try.
- Thanks.

95
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:08,997
Drive safe.

96
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,933
Uh, say hi
to your sister for me.

97
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,303
- Sure.
- Okay.

98
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:20,875
Turn around.

99
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,592
Fuck it.

100
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:41,863
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

101
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,967
All roads are closed up ahead.

102
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,737
Uh, come in.

103
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,104
Stop!

104
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,674
Just wait!
Stay where you are.

105
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,193
<i>It looks
like Wendy's now gonna go</i>

106
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:56,077
<i>right through the middle
of our state.</i>

107
00:07:56,211 --> 00:08:00,115
<i>We strongly urge local residents to
listen to all warnings from officials.</i>

108
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:02,884
<i>If you're in an evacuation zone,
you gotta get out.</i>

109
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,553
<i>You can't wait.</i>

110
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,956
<i>We... We won't be able
to come for you.</i>

111
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,394
<i>I hope every parent in the state
is thinking,</i>

112
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,463
<i>"How do I keep my family safe?"</i>

113
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,538
Dad?

114
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,148
Dad?

115
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,218
Dad!

116
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:13,456
Hi. Hey, Sugar.

117
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:14,623
Hey, girl.

118
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,559
Where's Daddy?

119
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,126
I missed you.

120
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,696
Where's Dad, hey?
Where is he?

121
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,196
<i>No sign of
Dad, but Sugar's here.</i>

122
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:57,232
He wouldn't have gone
without her.

123
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,001
It's weird. It's like a ghost town.
Everyone's gone.

124
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,004
<i>Please,
just get yourself somewhere safe,</i>

125
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,307
<i>even if you have to
stop at a shelter.</i>

126
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:07,343
You think he went
to the old house?

127
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:10,211
<i>No, I think it's been in
escrow since the divorce.</i>

128
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:13,816
Beth, there's pictures of you,
me, and Mom laid out everywhere.

129
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:17,720
This condo is horrible.
It's depressing.

130
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:22,023
<i>Haley, you have to stop blaming them.
It was their mutual decision.</i>

131
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,960
Whatever.
I'm gonna check the house.

132
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,171
- <i>No, don't you dare. I'm not hav...</i>
- Hey, I bumped into

133
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:28,964
your ex-boyfriend Wayne
on the way down.

134
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:30,766
<i>He was not my boyfriend.</i>

135
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,936
Whatever you say. I still remember
the time Dad caught you guys.

136
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,506
<i>Stop! Oh, my God. How do you remember that?
You were like...</i>

137
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,140
I was eight.

138
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:40,910
- <i>God.</i>
- Scarred me for life.

139
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,778
<i>I'm never gonna live that down.</i>

140
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:45,079
No. Never ever.

141
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,059
Don't give me that look.

142
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,128
I was gonna visit more.
I just...

143
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,230
got busy.

144
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,833
I'm trying to have
a life of my own, you know.

145
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,168
I love visiting the swamp.

146
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:10,271
Heat, humidity,

147
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,775
mosquitoes.

148
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:15,311
What's not to like, eh?

149
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:17,245
Oh, yeah, except you.

150
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,415
My little fur baby.

151
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,576
Oh, thank God.

152
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:05,794
Come on, Sugar.

153
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,581
Dad!

154
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,392
Hello?

155
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,815
Dad, you here?

156
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,257
Dad?

157
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,740
Marco! Polo! Anybody?

158
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:32,347
Dad!

159
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:39,788
Dad!

160
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,175
Where is he, girl?

161
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:06,548
Come on.

162
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:28,437
Shit.

163
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:56,865
Oh, my God.

164
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:20,856

165

00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,803

Can you hear him? Dad?

167
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,873
Dad? Dad!

168
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:42,911
I gotta go down there, don't I?

169
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:46,782
Okay.

170
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:56,525
Ah.

171

175
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:26,989
Stay here, okay?

176
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,634
Uh!

177
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,031
Ohh!

179
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:22,778
Dad?

180
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,481
Aww!

181
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:28,684
Ugh, shit.

182

184

Oh, my God.

198
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:26,601
Okay. We need to get to a hospital,
all right? We need to go right now.

There's a big gator.

00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:12,321
Yeah, I know.
We've already met.

216

How'd it even get down here?

217
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:19,861
I don't know.

218
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:22,964
It must've come through the...

on the lake side.

220
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:31,607
Ohh.
Why did you come here?

221
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,844
You're welcome.

You need to go. Now.

224
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:43,084
- Not without you.
- I don't need your help.

225
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:49,759
Ah, ah...

226
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,293
Yeah,
I can clearly see that.

227
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,599
Wait.

228
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,035
Sugar?

229
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,406
Yeah.
She helped me find you.

230
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,510

231
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,179

232
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,215
What's with the beard?

233
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,951
Oh, it's for
my Internet dating.

234
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:21,424
What's happening
with the storm?

235
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:25,394
It's pretty bad.
Everyone's gone.

236
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:28,129
What are you even
doing here?

237
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,231
I wanted to board up
some vents.

238
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:33,234
I mean, in this house.
I thought you sold the place.

239
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:35,704
Deal fell through.

240
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:46,715
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit. What happened?

241
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:52,187
Got tangled up in the pipes
when he tried to drag me.

242
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:55,089
That's how I escaped.

243
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,158
We're okay
on this side of the pipes.

244
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:59,961
It's too big to get back here.

245
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,201
I've gotta go get my phone.

246
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:09,103
Nobody is coming
in this storm, Haley.

247
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:10,673
I have to try.

248
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,476
I'm getting us out of here.

249
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:15,009
Okay, okay.

250
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:18,012
Go this way.
It's safer. Okay.

251
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:19,648
You keep your eye on him.

252
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,784
They can't hear you
out of the water.

253
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,586
They can see you in the dark.

254
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,188
- They're not as fast out of...
- I know, Dad.

255
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,157
Stay here.

256
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,360
Well,
I thought I'd go for a run.

257
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,544
Dad? Keep talking to me.

258
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:52,180
How's your split
in the hundred free?

259
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:56,217
- Really?
- You asked me to talk.

260
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,187
We already talked
about the weather.

261
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:01,857
I lost my last relay.

262
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:04,960
- When?
- This morning at practice.

263
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:06,629
By two hundredths.

264
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:09,331
Two hundredths, that's nothing.
You got that.

265
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,233
You just gotta want it, baby.

266
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:17,071
If I lose my spot on the travel
team, I lose my scholarship.

267
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,310
- Maybe I've reached my limit.
- No.

268
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:24,780
I keep telling you, it's not your
body that's holding you back.

269
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,449
Because what are you?

270
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,217
You're not my coach anymore,
Dad.

271
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,387
That apex-predator shit
doesn't help.

272
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm just saying, you could
believe in yourself a little more.

273
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:36,692
Oh, yeah.
Look who's talking.

274
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:39,193
Every athlete
reaches a plateau.

275
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,129
- Dad, just stop.
- It's normal.

276
00:27:41,262 --> 00:27:43,231
I need to focus, okay?

277
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:46,535
Haley,
just forget about the team.

278
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:50,906
Just remember what got you into
swimming in the first place.

279
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,073
You did.

280
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,779
You're gonna blame me
'cause you have a gift.

281
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:59,481
And I needed to kick you
in the butt a little.

282
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:02,250
I know you, Haley.

283
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:08,791
You're not gonna give up now.

284
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:12,561
You don't know
anything about me.

285
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:25,567
Yes.

286

329
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:41,129
- You check the register?
- Empty.

330
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:46,302
- It's heavy.
- You got it? Wait, wait, wait.

331
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:52,040
- You got it?
- Yeah.

332
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:58,013
Whoo!
How we gonna open this baby?

333
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:01,683
Who cares? Think of all the shit
we'll get with all this cash.

334
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,755
Maybe it's empty too.

335
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,823
Feels pretty loaded to me.

336
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:10,992
Come on, Stan, time to go!

337
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:28,810
Will you go get your brother?
We have to leave.

338
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,788
Come on, Stan!

339
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:45,428
What the fuck
are you doing? Marv!

340
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:48,230
I think there's some
people in that house over there.

341
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:49,931
Help!

342
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:57,973
Help! Help!

343
00:38:58,106 --> 00:39:03,111
Marv! Marv, there's nothing there.
Let's go. You're gonna get shot.

344
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:12,821
Hey! Hey, we're here!

345
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:14,357
Come on!

346
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:16,157
Please!

347
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:41,049
See, I told you... Fuck!

348
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:49,858
Shit.

349
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:52,827
No!

350
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:54,497
No!

351
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,846
Stan!

352
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,716
Stan, get out of the water!

353
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,518
Get out of the water, Stan!

354
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,389
Stan!

355
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,525
Ah!

356
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,904
Haley? Listen to me.

357
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,408
There's another way out.

358
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:15,176
Go over
to the other access hatch.

359
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:17,278
By the entrance to the house.

360
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,483
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

361
00:41:20,616 --> 00:41:24,320
Crawl along the foundation
till you reach the wet wall.

362
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:27,723
They're all wet, Dad.

363
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:29,625
No, listen.

364
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:31,694
It's where all the pipes go up
into the house.

365
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:35,230
But be careful.
You'll be pretty exposed over there.

366
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,566
Okay.

367
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:10,291
Ahh, ahh.

368
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:46,795
Oh.

369
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,565
Hey, Sugar. Hey.

370
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:51,433
Good girl.

371
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,101
Hey, girl.

372
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:55,203
Good girl.

373
00:43:57,773 --> 00:43:59,207
Did you find it?

374
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,611
Yeah, it's stuck.

375
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:07,483
There's something on top of it.

376
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:09,785
Is there a plan B?

377
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:11,687
That was our plan B.

378
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,960
In less than an hour,
this crawl space will be under water.

379
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:20,996
What about
the overflow drainpipe?

380
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:23,999
No. They came in from there.

381
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:27,570
Come back to this side of the pipes.
We'll figure something out.

382
00:44:56,365 --> 00:44:58,299
There's somebody out there.

383
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:13,582
Dad, it's the police!

384
00:45:13,716 --> 00:45:15,884
Help! Hello!

385
00:45:16,018 --> 00:45:17,920
- Hey!
- It's Wayne. Help!

386
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:31,132
Stay with the boat.
I'll be right back.

387
00:45:45,514 --> 00:45:46,548
Haley?

388
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,688
- Hey, Wayne!
- Wayne!

389
00:45:55,057 --> 00:45:56,392
Wayne!

390
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:57,893
Down here!

391
00:45:58,627 --> 00:45:59,662
Wayne!

392
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:01,897
Hey!

393
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:04,165
Mr. Keller!

394
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:24,185
Mr. Keller!

395
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,755
Wayne! Wayne!

396
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,657
- Wayne!
- Wayne!

397
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,927
Wayne!

398
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:45,007
Wayne!

399
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,575
He's heading to the garage!

400
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:03,585
Haley!

401
00:48:05,754 --> 00:48:07,055
Wayne?

402
00:48:08,323 --> 00:48:10,259
No, Wayne, wait! Stop!

403
00:48:10,392 --> 00:48:12,427
Stop! Wait, don't come down!

404
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:14,496
- No! Stay there!
- Hey!

405
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,666
Wait!
There's two gators down here!

406
00:48:18,901 --> 00:48:21,503
Okay, hold on.
Don't move. Hold on!

407
00:48:23,472 --> 00:48:26,308
Come in, Pete.

408
00:48:27,543 --> 00:48:28,644
Pete, you copy?

409
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:30,579
<i>Pete, do you copy?</i>

410
00:48:34,383 --> 00:48:35,727
Pete, goddamn it, man.
Where are you?

411
00:48:35,751 --> 00:48:37,953
I need you down here now
with a snare pole!

412
00:48:39,488 --> 00:48:41,423
Pete, did you hear that?

413
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:07,616
Help me!

414
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,552
Haley, help me!

415
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:12,888
Wayne!

416
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:21,029
Grab my hand!

417
00:50:02,571 --> 00:50:03,839
I got you.

418
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:07,843
I couldn't save him.

419
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,052
It's okay. Shh.

420
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:20,489
It's okay.
They can't get in here.

421
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:22,457
We're safe here.

422
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:26,961
Dad.

423
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:28,096
Okay.

424
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:31,900
Shh. It's okay.

425
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:33,135
It's okay.

426
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,611
I never thought
it would end like this.

427
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:45,981
We should never have
come back here.

428
00:50:46,114 --> 00:50:49,785
Haley, you stay strong.
We're getting out of here.

429
00:51:00,062 --> 00:51:03,031
You remember
when you were little,

430
00:51:03,165 --> 00:51:07,235
and Beth could hold her breath for the
length of the pool and you couldn't?

431
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,072
I'm not really up for
memory lane right now, Dad.

432
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:13,875
Yeah, well, you got so mad
and you stormed off.

433
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:16,478
Yeah, I was a little jerk.

434
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:19,315
Yeah, well, Haley, that night,

435
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:23,151
I woke up about 2:00 in the morning
'cause I heard something outside.

436
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:25,421
I thought it was a burglar,
so I snuck down,

437
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:27,457
and I saw you in the pool,

438
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:30,926
taking your giant breaths
again and again.

439
00:51:32,362 --> 00:51:34,196
And you did it, Haley.

440
00:51:34,997 --> 00:51:37,866
You figured that shit out
all by yourself.

441
00:51:40,168 --> 00:51:44,039
And that's when I knew,
this kid's a fighter.

442
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:49,678
So we may be stubborn,
but we do not give up.

443
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,216
You gave up on Mom.

444
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:58,520
Mom was not happy,
and I was selfish,

445
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,423
and I didn't
pay enough attention to her.

446
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:01,857
- Because of me.
- No.

447
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,993
Yes, because you were
always with me.

448
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:09,064
Every weekend at the meets.
On the road away from home.

449
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:12,301
It had nothing to do with you.
Is that what you think?

450
00:52:20,008 --> 00:52:23,111
It was you and Beth
that kept us together.

451
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:27,582
When you girls left,
we were just...

452
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:33,021
two lonely people
in a big, empty house.

453
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,758
Nobody to even pretend for.

454
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:42,798
Your mom got a second chance,
Haley, and she deserves to be happy.

455
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:44,933
So do you.

456
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:48,937
I don't think I deserve one.

457
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,208
I miss you.

458
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:57,212
I miss seeing your face
in the stands when I win.

459
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:59,549
Why don't you come
anymore?

460
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:02,617
- I thought you were mad at me.
- I am!

461
00:53:03,419 --> 00:53:04,820
I know.

462
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:28,110
We are gonna beat
these pea-brained lizard shits.

463
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,112
You and me.

464
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:34,950
They didn't like it
when I was banging on the pipes.

465
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,819
I think I can distract them
if you can dive

466
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:40,590
all the way under
until you get to the stairs.

467
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:42,691
Yeah, I can do it.

468
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:45,528
You ready?

469
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,895
Yeah.

470
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:49,532
I'm coming back for you, okay?

471
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,233
You'd better.

472
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:54,903
Okay.

473
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,002
Okay.

474
00:54:47,356 --> 00:54:48,457
Go.

475
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,141
Ahh!

476
00:57:09,398 --> 00:57:10,433
Dad?

477
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:12,501
I can't make it to the stairs.

478
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,640
I'm going for the drainpipe,
okay?

479
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:19,240
No.

480
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,410
It's too dangerous.

481
00:57:23,312 --> 00:57:24,447
You hear me?

482
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:29,084
Haley?

483
00:58:13,462 --> 00:58:15,531
Oh.

484
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,921
Oh, shit.

485
01:00:19,655 --> 01:00:21,089
Ah!

486
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,729
Haley!

487
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:43,111
Haley! Answer me!

488
01:00:44,914 --> 01:00:46,448
I killed one.

489
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:30,719
Haley? Hey.

490
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:38,787
Ah!

491
01:03:46,227 --> 01:03:47,463
Hey!

492
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,866
We're over here! Help!

493
01:03:52,868 --> 01:03:55,637
Haley?

494
01:04:14,723 --> 01:04:15,891
Dad!

495
01:04:20,863 --> 01:04:22,831
Haley! Help!

496
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:26,802
Haley!

497
01:04:54,096 --> 01:04:55,831
Dad, I'm coming!

498
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:21,890
No!

499
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:23,358
No.

500
01:05:23,492 --> 01:05:27,062
One, two, three, four.

501
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:32,000
Come on! Wake up!

502
01:05:32,134 --> 01:05:33,468
No.

503
01:05:37,105 --> 01:05:39,309
Come on. Four, five, six.

504
01:05:39,441 --> 01:05:41,510
Don't quit on me, Daddy,
come on!

505
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:45,848
One, two, three, four.

506
01:05:47,382 --> 01:05:49,718
No, no, no!

507
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:54,089
Come on, Daddy, wake up!

508
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:58,293
Come on!

509
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:03,966
Yes, Daddy, yes! Yes!

510
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:09,104
Yes, yes, yes!

511
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,942
- You're okay. You're okay.
- Oh, God.

512
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:28,423
Hey, Sugar.

513
01:06:29,224 --> 01:06:32,160
Okay, Sugar. It's okay.

514
01:06:33,462 --> 01:06:36,965
Come on. Let's get to the car.

515
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,109
Oh, shit.

516
01:06:48,277 --> 01:06:49,511
No way!

517
01:06:54,116 --> 01:06:55,751
Dad, what do we do?

518
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:04,459
Boat! You see over there?

519
01:07:04,593 --> 01:07:07,796
No, there are too many of 'em.
We need to stay here.

520
01:07:08,497 --> 01:07:09,774
No, those levees
are gonna break,

521
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:12,034
and when they do
we can't be here.

522
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,536
That boat's
our only chance to leave.

523
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,538
I think we can make it.

524
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,107
It's impossible.

525
01:07:21,043 --> 01:07:24,212
They gather in the floodwaters
'cause it's easier to hunt.

526
01:07:24,347 --> 01:07:26,349
They hunt what splashes.

527
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:29,952
So no splashing, no hunting.

528
01:07:31,687 --> 01:07:33,789
I think
the rain should cover us.

529
01:07:33,922 --> 01:07:34,957
Okay.

530
01:07:37,427 --> 01:07:38,927
Come on, girl.

531
01:07:40,363 --> 01:07:42,998
It's okay. All right.

532
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:53,001
The eye is above us.

533
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:05,180
We'd better hurry.

534
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:07,983
Ohh.

535
01:09:10,085 --> 01:09:11,653
Don't move.

536
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:29,704
Levees just broke!

537
01:09:30,306 --> 01:09:32,774
Haley, you need to swim.

538
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:37,513
You got this!
You're faster than they are!

539
01:09:37,646 --> 01:09:39,348
What are you?

540
01:09:40,182 --> 01:09:41,317
Swim!

541
01:10:15,217 --> 01:10:16,618
Whoo!

542
01:10:18,053 --> 01:10:20,155
Apex predator all day!

543
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:30,399
Come on!

544
01:10:41,009 --> 01:10:42,677
- Hold on!
- Get down!

545
01:11:10,839 --> 01:11:13,008
- Dad! Dad!
- Take my hand!

546
01:11:15,344 --> 01:11:16,978
Help!

547
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:21,216
- Haley!
- No! No!

548
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:53,848
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

549
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:01,923
Dad! Where are you?

550
01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:04,159
Haley!

551
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:06,495
I'm here!

552
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:09,465
Oh.

553
01:12:42,465 --> 01:12:43,898
Hey!

554
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,335
Meet me at the stairs.

555
01:13:18,401 --> 01:13:20,168
Oh! Ohh!

556
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:51,926
Hello? Hello.
Can anybody hear me?

557
01:14:53,596 --> 01:14:56,097
Yes! Yes, hello!

558
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:59,200
I'm trapped with my father
in our house in Coral Lake.

559
01:14:59,635 --> 01:15:01,102
It's flooded.

560
01:15:01,236 --> 01:15:03,439
There's alligators everywhere.

561
01:15:03,873 --> 01:15:05,341
Please send help.

562
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,810
Please, can you hear me?

563
01:15:09,712 --> 01:15:11,212
No, come on!

564
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:36,104
Sugar?

565
01:15:39,842 --> 01:15:42,243
Come on. Come here, girl.

566
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:44,513
Come on.

567
01:15:50,185 --> 01:15:51,953
Good girl.

568
01:15:52,954 --> 01:15:54,557
Good girl.

569
01:15:56,358 --> 01:15:57,358
Haley!

570
01:16:09,705 --> 01:16:10,739
Dad!

571
01:16:12,441 --> 01:16:13,476
Dad!

572
01:16:24,687 --> 01:16:25,788
Dad!

573
01:16:25,921 --> 01:16:28,122
- Dad!
- Go!

574
01:16:28,524 --> 01:16:29,592
Go!

575
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:36,565
Swim!

576
01:17:34,957 --> 01:17:36,525
Come on, you son of a bitch!

577
01:17:54,543 --> 01:17:57,313
Come on, we gotta
get to the roof. Come on.

578
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,115
Come on, we gotta go.

579
01:18:01,884 --> 01:18:03,686
Keep the pressure on your arm.

580
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:06,087
Stay with me!

581
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:21,770
- The house made it after all.
- Yeah, she's a strong one.

582
01:18:21,904 --> 01:18:23,137
Come on.

583
01:18:25,975 --> 01:18:28,344
I lied to you
about the deal.

584
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:32,280
I just couldn't sign the papers.

585
01:18:32,414 --> 01:18:35,116
- I don't want to sell.
- It doesn't matter, Dad.

586
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:39,088
- It's just a house.
- It's not just a house. It's our home.

587
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,557
The last place we were a family.

588
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:43,459
This house isn't our home.

589
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:46,762
Me and you, that's home.

590
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:49,398
- Come on. You okay?
- Yeah.

591
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:53,402
- Did you see that?
- What?

592
01:18:54,003 --> 01:18:55,738
It's the rescue helicopter.

593
01:18:55,871 --> 01:18:57,306
All right, go. Hurry!

594
01:19:02,243 --> 01:19:04,847
Here! We're here!

595
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,214
Help!

596
01:19:07,383 --> 01:19:08,651
Do they see it?

597
01:19:09,217 --> 01:19:10,452
Come on!

598
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:18,594
Haley!

599
01:19:22,998 --> 01:19:24,066
You okay?

600
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:26,301
Dad, get to the roof!

601
01:19:26,935 --> 01:19:28,771
- Okay.
- I see a way out!

602
01:20:52,721 --> 01:20:53,756
Ah!

603
01:20:58,961 --> 01:21:00,362
Ah!

604
01:21:16,011 --> 01:21:17,045
Ahh!

605
01:22:08,263 --> 01:22:09,531
Wha...
