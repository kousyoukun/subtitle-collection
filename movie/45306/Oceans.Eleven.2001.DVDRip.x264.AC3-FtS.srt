1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,200
-Good morning.
-Morning.

2
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,990
-State your name for the record.
-Daniel Ocean.

3
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,210
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

4
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,500
...whether you are
likely to break the law again.

5
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,590
This was your first conviction,
but you were implicated...

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,300
...in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

7
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,090
What can you tell us about this?

8
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,890
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,940
We're trying to find out...

10
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,100
...if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

11
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,270
...or just a reason
you got caught this time.

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,280
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

13
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,120
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

14
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,920
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

15
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,460
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

16
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,920
-Chips, please.
-Sure.

17
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,680
-Change 150. Quarters or nickels?
-Quarters are fine.

18
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,520
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

19
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,950
Twenty. Dealer has 19. Good start.

20
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,750
-I'm going on break now.
-Here. Thank you very much.

21
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,870
-Good luck.
-You have a good one.

22
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,710
-How are you, sir?
-Hello, Frank.

23
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,350
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

24
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,390
My name is Ramon.
As you can see right here.

25
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,560
-My mistake.
-No problem, sir.

26
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,480
The table's cold anyway.

27
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,280
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1 :00.

28
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,320
-1 :00?
-Yes, sir.

29
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,990
Thanks, Ramon.

30
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,700
Thank you.

31
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,090
-Checking up on current events?
-Ramon.

32
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,310
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

33
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,890
-You just got out?
-This afternoon.

34
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,480
You seen him?

35
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,820
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

36
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,190
You have a plan already?

37
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,650
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

38
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,200
Officer Brooks...

39
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,120
...this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,000
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

41
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,710
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

42
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,010
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

43
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,730
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

44
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,990
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

45
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,950
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager--

46
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,910
-Bernie?
-Not Bernie. My business manager.

47
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Actually, they' re both named Bernie.

48
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,210
He said what we do could
be considered research...

49
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,550
...for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

50
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,640
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

51
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,810
...but I'd have to pay you by check.

52
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,270
Or we could just stick to cash.

53
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,110
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

54
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,870
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

55
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,960
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

56
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,750
Josh. To the left.

57
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,550
Deal to your left.

58
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,380
-Shane?
-Hit me.

59
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,300
-It's not blackjack.
-Dude!

60
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,600
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

61
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,940
-Left. Left.
-Left, I'll get it.

62
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,270
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

63
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,980
-Blue.
-Blue, that's a 50.

64
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,900
-I'll call?
-Okay.

65
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,150
Shane's calling. 50.

66
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,280
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

67
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,240
Betting's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

68
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,830
Yeah, thanks, man.

69
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,170
-Right.
-How many?

70
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,420
-Four.
-You don't want four. You wanna fold.

71
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,340
-I wanna fold?
-Fold.

72
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,010
Is that good?

73
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,590
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

74
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,970
You're done. You have three pairs.

75
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,810
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

76
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,270
-Maybe one was mine.
-Wasn't me.

77
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,520
Fellas!

78
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,860
All reds.

79
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,780
What up, dog?

80
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,870
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

81
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,550
-How's the game going?
-Longest hour of my life.

82
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,390
-What?
-I'm running away with your wife.

83
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,350
Great.

84
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,530
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

85
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,700
Not for me, dude.

86
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,580
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

87
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,790
...if that's cool with you.

88
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,050
What do you do for a living?
If you don't mind me asking.

89
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,510
Why would I mind you asking?

90
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,090
Two cards.

91
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,890
I just got out of prison.

92
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,600
-Really?
-Why were you in prison?

93
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,230
I stole things.

94
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,940
You stole things? Like jewels?

95
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,440
Incan matrimonial head masks.

96
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,490
-Any money in Incan matrimonial--?
-Head masks. Some.

97
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,740
Don't let him fool you. There's
loads if you can move them.

98
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,210
-I'll take one. But you can't.
-My fence seemed confident.

99
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,880
-With cash you don't need a fence.
-Some lack vision.

100
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,510
Probably everybody in cellblock E.

101
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,470
That's $500.

102
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,090
-What's the first lesson in poker?
-Never bet on the--

103
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,930
-No, leave emotion at the door.
-Right.

104
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,930
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

105
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,350
That much money early in the game....

106
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,020
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

107
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,650
Barry?

108
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,990
All right.

109
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,240
I fold.

110
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,870
-Josh?
-Don't worry, I'm game.

111
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,830
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

112
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,880
-...$500 of my own.
-That's a very handsome bet.

113
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,800
Careful, don't push him too high,
too fast. I Keep him on the leash.

114
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,010
-Holly?
-Call.

115
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,180
Call.

116
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,680
And I'll call.

117
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,020
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

118
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,240
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

119
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

120
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,660
-Josh?
-Two.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,460
Thattagirl. Call.

122
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,670
-Call.
-Call.

123
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,300
Let's see them.

124
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,350
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

125
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,810
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

126
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

127
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,000
-God, I'm bored.
-You look bored.

128
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,470
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

129
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,930
Why do you think I
came to see you first?

130
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,100
-So tell me.
-It's tricky.

131
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,980
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

132
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,270
-Guns?
-Not quite. High security. The take--

133
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,610
-The target?
-Eight figures.

134
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,690
What's the target?

135
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,320
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

136
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,370
You want to knock over a casino?

137
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,630
The vault at the Bellagio.

138
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,480
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

139
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,440
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

140
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,570
You said three casinos?

141
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,740
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

142
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,120
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

143
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,250
-These are Terry Benedict's places.
-Yes, they are.

144
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,750
-Think he'll mind?
-More than somewhat.

145
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,130
You'd need at least 12 guys
doing a combination of cons.

146
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,970
Like what, you think?

147
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,430
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

148
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,060
...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

149
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,190
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

150
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,320
Where will you get
the money to back this?

151
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,570
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

152
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,200
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

153
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,280
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

154
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,120
-Reuben.
-Reuben.

155
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,830
Hey.

156
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,420
Oscar, lower it a bit, would you?

157
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,130
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

158
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,380
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

159
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,600
-Whatever you need.
-Appreciate it.

160
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,350
What?

161
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
I need a reason.

162
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,690
And don't say money. Why do this?

163
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,950
Why not do it?

164
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,000
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

165
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,250
...and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

166
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,420
Because the house always wins.

167
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,840
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

168
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,640
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

169
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,560
-You practiced that speech?
-Did I rush it?

170
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,310
It was good.
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

171
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,320
I wonder what Reuben will say.

172
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,950
You're out of your damn minds!

173
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,450
You're both of you nuts!

174
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,170
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

175
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,250
And it cannot be beaten.

176
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,590
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

177
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,630
They got timers, vaults.

178
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,640
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

179
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,720
Okay, bad example.

180
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,640
It's never been tried.

181
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,270
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

182
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,190
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

183
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Number three, the bronze medal.

184
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,780
Pencil neck grabs a
lockbox at the Horseshoe.

185
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,200
Grab the guy in the suit!

186
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,790
He got two steps closer to
the door than anyone before.

187
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,210
Leave the money!

188
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,370
Second most successful robbery:

189
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,090
The Flamingo in '71. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

190
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,920
...before they grabbed him.

191
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,350
Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.

192
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,390
Goddamn hippie.

193
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,850
And the closest any man
has ever come...

194
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,100
...to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

195
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,360
... was outside of Caesars in '87.

196
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,570
He came...

197
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,900
...he grabbed...

198
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,570
...they conquered.

199
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,410
But what am I saying? You guys
are pros. The best.

200
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,630
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

201
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,210
Of course, lest we forget...

202
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,630
...once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

203
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,850
You're right. He's right.

204
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,720
Our eyes were bigger than
our stomachs.

205
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,980
-That's what it is. Ego.
-Yeah, blah, blah.

206
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,150
-Thanks for lunch.
-The nicoise was delicious.

207
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,860
-Sorry to bother you.
-Look, we go way back...

208
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,240
...and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

209
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,160
-Our pleasure.
-I'd never been to Belize.

210
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,120
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

211
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,170
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

212
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,760
The Bellagio, the Mirage and
the MGM Grand.

213
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,300
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

214
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,600
-Is that right?
-That's right.

215
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,770
You guys...

216
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,190
...what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

217
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,650
What do you have against
him, is the question.

218
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,900
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

219
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,620
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

220
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,460
-I see what you're doing.
-What are we doing?

221
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,420
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

222
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,760
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

223
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,840
But Benedict....

224
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,640
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

225
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,770
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

226
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,230
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

227
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,820
Well-funded.

228
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,990
You gotta be nuts too.

229
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,530
And you're gonna need a
crew as nuts as you are.

230
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,620
Who do you got in mind?

231
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,830
-Alright, who 's in?
-Frank C. is in.

232
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,760
Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.

233
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,470
Drivers?

234
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,350
-I talked to the Malloys.
-Mormon twins?

235
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,060
They're in Utah, off the job.

236
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,690
They're having
trouble filling the hours.

237
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,460
-Waiting, sweetheart.
-Good. Go.

238
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,000
-I'm waiting.
-Why?

239
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,170
-You're a little girl!
-Relax.

240
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

241
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,380
Relax.

242
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,630
-Electronics?
-Livingston Dell.

243
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,930
He 's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.

244
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,850
-How are his nerves?
-Not so bad.

245
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,100
Move in a little bit.

246
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,730
-Don't-- Don't touch that.
-Why not?

247
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,360
Do you see me grabbing your
gun and waving it around?

248
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,150
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

249
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,250
Munitions.

250
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
-Phil Turrentine.
-Dead.

251
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,500
-No shit. On the job?
-Skin cancer.

252
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,800
-You send flowers?
-Dated his wife for a while.

253
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,090
Basher's in town.

254
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,760
There may be an issue
with availability.

255
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,650
All right, chaps...

256
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,940
...hang on to your knickers.

257
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,380
Oh, leave it out!

258
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,180
You tossers! You had one job to do!

259
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,810
That's all you used in the event?

260
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,640
-You accusing me of booby-trapping?
-Well?

261
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,730
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

262
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,690
Basher?

263
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,070
Peck. ATF.

264
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,070
Let me venture a guess.

265
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,700
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

266
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,410
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

267
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,750
...for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

268
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,500
Stand back.

269
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,340
Here we go.

270
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,130
-Find Griggs. I need him.
-Who?

271
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,300
Just find him, will you?

272
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,390
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

273
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,770
Done.

274
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,350
-Is Danny about?
-He's around the corner.

275
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,530
Terrific. It'll be nice working with
proper villains again.

276
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,110
Everybody down! Get down!

277
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,450
They weren't expecting that shit!

278
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,370
-Nice work.
-Thanks.

279
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,470
-Which one's the Amazing Yen?
-The little Chinese guy.

280
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,980
-Who else is on the list?
-He is the list.

281
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,650
It doesn't seem that diff--

282
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
-We got a grease man.
-We got a grease man.

283
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,510
We need Saul.

284
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,510
-He got out of the game a year ago.
-He get religion?

285
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,180
Ulcers.

286
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,730
-You could ask him.
-Hey, I could ask him.

287
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,550
I saw you at the paddock...

288
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,850
...before the second race, outside the
men's room when I placed my bet.

289
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,270
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

290
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,900
-How you been, Saul?
-Never better.

291
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,980
What's with the orange?

292
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,820
-My doctor says I need vitamins.
-Why don't you take vitamins?

293
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,660
You come here to give me a physical?

294
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,070
Box seats. Come on.

295
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,220
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

296
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,220
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

297
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,270
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

298
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,930
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

299
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,310
I'm seeing a lady who works the
counter at Macy's.

300
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,020
I've changed.

301
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,200
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

302
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,450
Quit conning me.

303
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,080
That your hound way in the rear?

304
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,120
He breaks late. Everyone knows this.

305
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,260
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

306
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,550
Tell me what the scam is?

307
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,120
Exhibit C: His belt as
king of the heavyweight crown.

308
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,500
Lennox Lewis has proved
he 's the champion.

309
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,800
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

310
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,010
You think we need one more?

311
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,970
You think we need one more.

312
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,310
Alright, we'll get one more.

313
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,600
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

314
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,110
-Who are you?
-A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

315
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,780
You're either in or out. Right now.

316
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,830
-What is it?
-It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

317
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,790
-You're pretty trusting.
-Bobby has faith in you.

318
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,290
Fathers are like that.

319
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,710
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

320
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,590
Do this job, he'll be
trading on yours.

321
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,390
Don't, and you can go back to
feeling up stockbrokers.

322
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,890
Can you get the check, please?

323
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,350
That's the best lift you've made yet.

324
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,310
Las Vegas?

325
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,310
America's playground.

326
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,490
Did you guys get a group
rate or something?

327
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,290
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

328
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,210
Not as often as I'd like.

329
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,380
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

330
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,550
I'll look into it.

331
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,180
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

332
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,430
Everybody sober?

333
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,520
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

334
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,320
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

335
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,280
If that's not your brand of vodka...

336
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,240
...eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

337
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,200
Otherwise, come with me.

338
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,710
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

339
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,180
-From Chicago?
-Yeah.

340
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,760
-You like it there?
-Yeah.

341
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,980
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

342
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,610
The 3000 block of
Las Vegas Boulevard...

343
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,370
...also known as the
Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand.

344
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,790
They' re three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

345
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,000
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

346
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,960
...beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

347
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,260
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

348
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,600
-We're gonna rob it.
-Smash-and-grab job?

349
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,270
Slightly more complicated than that.

350
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,560
Well, yeah.

351
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:28,360
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

352
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,110
Bad news first.

353
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,660
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

354
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,910
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

355
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,660
Next, through these doors...

356
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,290
...each one requiring a different
code changed every 12 hours.

357
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,260
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

358
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,140
-It won't move without fingerprint l.D.
-Which we can't fake.

359
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,310
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

360
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,100
Which we won't get.

361
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,310
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

362
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,360
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

363
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,030
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

364
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,530
Just two more guards with Uzis...

365
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,580
...and the most elaborate vault
door ever conceived.

366
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,920
Any questions?

367
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,540
Tunneling's out. There are...

368
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,630
...sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

369
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,470
-Anyone else?
-You mentioned good news?

370
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,720
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

371
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,900
...a casino to keep enough cash to
cover every chip in play on the floor.

372
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,610
That means on a weekday
it must carry...

373
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,900
...between $60 and $70 million in
cash and coin.

374
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,030
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

375
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,330
...like in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

376
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,960
...$150 million,
without breaking a sweat.

377
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,170
There are 11 of us,
each with an equal share.

378
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,000
You do the math.

379
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,670
Exactly.

380
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,260
I have a question.

381
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,930
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

382
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,510
...down the elevator
we can't move...

383
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,850
...past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open--

384
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,690
-And not seen by cameras.
-Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

385
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,610
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

386
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,450
...we're just supposed to walk out of
there with $150 million...

387
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,240
...without getting stopped?

388
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,580
Yeah.

389
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,130
Oh. Okay.

390
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,140
First task: reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...

391
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,270
...in all casinos, from
the dealers' rotation...

392
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:13,480
...to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.

393
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,150
This girl Charmaine...

394
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,910
Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.

395
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,370
...dances at Crazy Horse Too.
It pays for her school.

396
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,790
-I think she really likes me.
-Cool.

397
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,920
Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.

398
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,920
Know the quick routes out.

399
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,720
-He went through at 10:44.
-10:46. Get a watch that works.

400
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,430
-You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
-10:46.

401
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,150
Second task: power.

402
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,190
On fight night, we 'll throw
the switch on Sin City.

403
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,200
-Basher, it's your show.
-You want broke, blind or bedlam?

404
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,820
-How about all three?
-Right, it's done.

405
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,040
Third task: surveillance.

406
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,210
Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.

407
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,330
We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?

408
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,710
It's not the least accessible
system I've seen.

409
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,420
-There's no closed-circuit to tap into?
-No.

410
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,600
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

411
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,850
Two. And one of them is lonely.

412
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,450
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

413
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,950
-Say hi to your mom for me.
-Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

414
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,400
Watch it, bud!

415
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,480
-You call me bud, pal?
-You call me pal, friend?

416
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,690
-You call me friend, jackass?
-Don't call me jackass.

417
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,200
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

418
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,290
Copy that. I see them.

419
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,690
-Is that a word? You made that up?
-" Obsequious" is a word.

420
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:19,210
-Sir, please move your balloons.
-You got in my way!

421
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,500
-I was trying to deliver balloons!
-Gentlemen!

422
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,430
-He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
-You're spitting in my face.

423
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,110
And we're up and running.

424
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:54,410
-Why are hallways always that color?
-They say taupe is very soothing.

425
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,750
-Hi.
-Fine, thanks.

426
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,510
-Move the balloons.
-Move them?

427
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,890
An important client is waiting for
these. I don't have time...

428
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,520
...for you circus animals.

429
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,430
Hey! Hold up a minute!

430
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,850
Excuse me!

431
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,020
Hey! Excuse me!

432
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,740
-Hey, you dropped this.
-Oh, thank you.

433
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,240
-How's the reception on those things?
-Excellent.

434
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,910
-Take care.
-Thanks.

435
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,790
-Well....
-Yeah.

436
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,630
Fourth task: construction.

437
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,930
We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.

438
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,100
-To practice?
-Something like that.

439
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,230
Fifth task: intelligence.
We need those codes, Linus...

440
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,520
...from the guy who has all three.

441
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,060
-Who, Benedict?
-Learn to love his shadow.

442
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,940
-All I get to do is watch the guy?
-Gotta walk before you crawl.

443
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,870
-Reverse that.
-Sixth task: transport.

444
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:04,170
Well, I am sorry, but $18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

445
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,130
Well, I understand.

446
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,300
-They are some great-looking vans.
-Yes, sir, top of the line.

447
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:18,720
-Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
-Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

448
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,020
-Denham like a jean.
-That's it. Just like the jean.

449
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:29,110
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

450
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,860
-I'm sorry?
-I've tried lots of lotion.

451
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:36,200
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

452
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,740
...she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

453
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,420
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

454
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:51,630
...but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

455
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:57,470
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

456
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,220
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash...

457
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,730
...l could drop that
down to seven--

458
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,850
Sixteen each.

459
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,150
-No?
-Yes, sir.

460
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,020
-You'd do that?
-Yes, sir.

461
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,820
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

462
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,530
-Well, I'm glad they did.
-They told me.

463
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,160
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

464
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,950
-You do that.
-Thank you.

465
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,050
-Very nice material.
-It's imported silk, Saul.

466
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,220
It's very nice.

467
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,850
Gentlemen, would you excuse us
for a second? Thanks.

468
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,860
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

469
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,910
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

470
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,960
...you won't wake up
the following morning.

471
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,090
He's ready.

472
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,590
My name is Lyman...

473
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,470
...Zerga.

474
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,430
My name is Lyman Zerga.

475
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,600
My name is Lyman Zerga.

476
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,800
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

477
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,420
That guy's a machine.

478
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,920
Good afternoon.

479
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,840
He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.

480
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,600
How are you, Tommy?

481
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,810
He remembers every valet's name.

482
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,440
Not bad for a guy worth
3/4 of a billion.

483
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,360
He works hard, hits the
lobby floor at 7 on the nose.

484
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,690
-Good evening, sir.
-How are you?

485
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,070
-Talks with his casino manager.
-About what?

486
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
All business.

487
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,200
Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.

488
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:30,540
There 's rarely an incident he doesn't
know about or handle personally.

489
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,670
Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.

490
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,300
He speaks Spanish, German and Italian
and is getting good at Japanese.

491
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,720
He 's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.

492
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,190
Contents: profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.

493
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,360
Like I said, a machine.

494
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,160
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

495
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,080
And two minutes after they' re changed,
he's got them.

496
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,380
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

497
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,960
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

498
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,010
...he seized his house and
bankrupted his--

499
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,760
In-law's dealership.

500
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,560
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

501
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,180
You scared?

502
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,140
You suicidal?

503
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,610
Only in the morning.

504
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,270
-Now what?
-Now comes the girl.

505
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,490
She comes down after him
if they' re in a snit.

506
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,280
-Where does she come from?
-The museum, there. She's the curator.

507
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,620
Here she is.

508
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,920
This is the best part of my day.

509
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:13,930
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

510
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,940
Tess.

511
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,100
Huh?

512
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,980
Her name is Tess.

513
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,340
-We have to talk. Now.
-Okay.

514
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,470
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

515
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,310
Who?

516
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,440
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

517
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,690
-...the guy who's screwing your wife.
-Ex-wife.

518
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,320
-Tell me.
-It's not about that.

519
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,870
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

520
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,330
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

521
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,330
Well, I lost something.

522
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:22,210
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

523
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,340
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

524
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:34,850
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

525
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,890
Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways.

526
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:43,820
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

527
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,030
-How'd she look?
-She looked good.

528
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,570
Thanks.

529
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,400
You like it?

530
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,070
I like that you like it.

531
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,240
-I'll see you tonight?
-Okay.

532
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,040
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

533
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,050
I'll see you tonight.

534
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,770
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

535
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,490
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

536
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,360
I don't believe in questions either.

537
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,830
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

538
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,750
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

539
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,870
He doesn't fool around.

540
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,040
-How are you, Eddie?
-Fine, sir.

541
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,590
Anything for me?

542
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:31,210
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

543
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,630
Who is he?

544
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,760
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

545
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:42,310
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

546
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,560
-One of the biggest.
-Zerga.

547
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,440
Yes, sir.

548
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,480
-Never heard of him.
-That's why I don't doubt it.

549
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,530
-He's staying here?
-He's in the Mirador suite.

550
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,490
-How's he doing?
-Up, almost 200.

551
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,000
Good for him.

552
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,350
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search....

553
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,350
Hello, Tess.

554
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,520
What are you doing here?

555
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,070
I'm out.

556
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,980
-Out?
-Of prison.

557
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,490
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

558
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,530
I don't smoke. Don't sit.

559
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:44,370
-Supposedly I paid my debt to society.
-Funny, I never got a check.

560
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,040
You're not wearing your ring.

561
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,920
I sold it. I don't have a husband
or didn't you get the papers?

562
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,800
-My last day inside.
-I told you I'd write.

563
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,890
-Danny, go now before--
-What? Benedict?

564
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,100
How you doing? Whiskey and whiskey.

565
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,110
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

566
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,360
-Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
-Remind you of anyone?

567
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:23,580
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

568
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,160
-Monet.
-And Manet had syphilis.

569
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,080
They also painted occasionally.

570
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,420
All right, I'll make this quick.

571
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,470
I came here for you.

572
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,720
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

573
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,180
You're a thief and a liar.

574
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:49,060
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

575
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,060
-Steal?
-Lie.

576
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,320
I'm with someone who
doesn't have to make...

577
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,650
-...that kind of distinction.
-He's clear on both.

578
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:00,280
-You have a problem.
-Only one?

579
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:05,740
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

580
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,120
Does he make you laugh?

581
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,750
He doesn't make me cry.

582
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,020
-The fight is Saturday night?
-Yes, would you like tickets?

583
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,980
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

584
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:40,700
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

585
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,780
A black briefcase, standard size...

586
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,540
...the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

587
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,670
I'll put it in the house safe.

588
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:55,960
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

589
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:01,630
-I need something more secure.
-Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our--

590
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,760
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

591
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,810
...will not go overlooked.

592
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:15,860
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

593
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:21,240
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

594
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,320
I left New York to escape what
happened. Can I get five years back?

595
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,700
-What you can do is not throw--
-You don't know anything.

596
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:34,670
You don't love me,
you're with someone else, fine.

597
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,790
I have to live with that.
But not him.

598
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,340
Just like an ex-husband.

599
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,920
-I'm not joking.
-I'm not laughing.

600
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,050
There's a conflict of interest
when you...

601
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,430
-...give me advice about my love life.
-But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

602
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,810
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

603
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:02,240
-That I better know what I'm doing.
-Do you? Now?

604
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,780
You should go if you don't.

605
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,740
I know what I'm doing.

606
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,280
What are you doing?

607
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,620
Just catching up.

608
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,330
-Meet my ex-husband.
-Danny Ocean.

609
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,130
-Mr. Ocean.
-I'm in your seat.

610
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:21,250
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

611
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,760
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

612
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,050
-Is that so?
-Imagine the odds.

613
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,140
" Of all the gin joints
in all the world."

614
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,930
You recently were
released from prison?

615
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,140
That's right.

616
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,440
-How does it feel to be out?
-About the same.

617
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:44,320
-Danny was just about to--
-I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

618
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:45,740
Stay, have a drink.

619
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,660
-I can't.
-He can't.

620
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,700
Well, then....

621
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,960
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

622
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,630
You never know.

623
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,840
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

624
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:05,800
So I should put
those towels back.

625
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,510
No, the towels you can keep.

626
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,480
-Good to see you, Tess.
-Take care, Danny.

627
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,900
-Terry.
-Danny.

628
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,860
Stinking....

629
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,570
Tomorrow the day is yours.

630
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,240
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

631
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:56,280
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

632
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,580
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

633
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,130
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

634
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,650
Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...

635
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:29,610
...and its elevator shut down for
two minutes. That's when we go.

636
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,740
You're in the middle of the
room, 10 feet from everything.

637
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,790
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

638
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,620
What do you do?

639
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,170
-Ten says he shorts it.
-Twenty.

640
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,800
Window or aisle, boys?

641
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,350
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

642
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,350
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

643
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,730
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

644
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,070
-You understand him?
-I'll explain later.

645
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,700
They' re so pony they blew the
backup grids one by one.

646
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,450
Basher, what happened?

647
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,330
They did what I would have done
but by accident.

648
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,080
Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.

649
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:30,300
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

650
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,670
Barney Rubble. Trouble!

651
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:41,140
-We could always--
-By tomorrow?

652
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,730
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

653
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,320
What's a pinch?

654
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,400
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

655
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,160
Better yet, a pinch is a
bomb without the bomb.

656
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:03,500
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

657
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,960
...shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

658
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,090
It usually doesn't matter because a
nuclear weapon destroys everything.

659
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,840
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

660
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,510
...without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

661
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,140
-...the 17th century.
-How long?

662
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,430
30 seconds.

663
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:29,560
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

664
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,770
-Like, for instance--
-Las Vegas?

665
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,820
Yeah, I think it might.

666
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,410
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

667
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,740
Where?

668
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,260
Let's go. Yen, Basher, come on.

669
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,130
Where you going?

670
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,090
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

671
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,640
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

672
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,070
Start.

673
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,490
-I got one.
-You thinking of one?

674
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,160
-No, I've thought of one.
-You're thinking of one.

675
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,410
No, I'm done. I have it.

676
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,120
-You a man?
-Yes. 19.

677
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,790
-You alive?
-Yes. 18.

678
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,410
-Evel Knievel.
-Shit!

679
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,330
-Don't touch me.
-I'm not.

680
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,130
-Your hand's in my face.
-It's not.

681
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,260
-Am I touching you?
-Your hand's in my face.

682
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,300
-Move.
-I didn't touch you.

683
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,550
-You just touched me.
-You made me touch you.

684
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,430
This is your side.
This is your side.

685
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,770
Get off. Get off.

686
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,630
I'm gonna need a score of
car batteries--

687
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,140
Where's Linus? Where's Linus?

688
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,110
-There he is.
-Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

689
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,740
Should someone help him?

690
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:53,040
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

691
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,590
Back it up.

692
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,190
Let him in.

693
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,070
You stupid bastard!

694
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,790
-I say stay, you stay.
-Got it.

695
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,250
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

696
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,880
I got it.

697
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,930
Where are they?

698
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,140
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

699
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:55,190
-They will be here.
-"They will be here." Schmuck!

700
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,780
You boys have a nice trip?

701
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,420
We have a problem.

702
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,380
You've been red-flagged.

703
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:24,420
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

704
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,720
Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.

705
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:32,390
That's a problem.

706
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,350
-Saul, turn that off.
-When I'm ready--

707
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,940
-Saul!
-It's off! It's off!

708
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,610
Any idea how this happened?

709
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,570
-No.
-Oh, come on.

710
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:51,620
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

711
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,910
-I tailed you.
-Who told you to?

712
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,250
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

713
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,710
-Tess?
-My wife.

714
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,380
-Ex-wife.
-Tess is here?

715
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:08,130
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

716
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,340
-You're out, Danny.
-He's out?

717
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:14,220
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

718
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,600
-It's not your call.
-You put her before us and made it mine.

719
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,600
This is my job.

720
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,110
Not anymore.

721
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:25,780
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

722
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,780
Kid, you up for it?

723
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:34,910
I can do it.

724
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,960
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

725
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,830
Curtain goes up at 7.

726
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:46,000
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

727
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,760
Yes. No.

728
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,970
Very much no.

729
01:03:55,220 --> 01:04:01,020
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

730
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:05,110
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

731
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:10,860
Hi.

732
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,700
What were you thinking about?

733
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,160
You.

734
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,630
Where you gonna put your hands?

735
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:27,750
No good.

736
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,010
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

737
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,680
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

738
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:40,890
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

739
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,850
Don't use seven words if four will do.

740
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:49,530
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

741
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,530
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

742
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,830
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't--

743
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,330
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

744
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,950
Sure.

745
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,970
Saul?

746
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,650
It's time.

747
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,580
Okay.

748
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,290
Let's do it.

749
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:53,510
On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...

750
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,760
... with the expected crowd of
celebrities and sports fans...

751
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:02,930
...piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...

752
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:09,110
...prepare to meet after an
eight-month dance toward each other.

753
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,980
Mr. Zerga?

754
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,150
Mr. Benedict.

755
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:20,620
-I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
-I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

756
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,000
My courier should be here momentarily.

757
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,270
Eighteen. Blackjack!

758
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:07,080
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

759
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:13,250
I can't have private security personnel
in the casino cages.

760
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:14,840
Of course not.

761
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,300
Saul! Saul Bloom, is that you?

762
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:22,800
Saul! Saul, it's me! Bucky Buchanan!

763
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:25,390
Remember? From Saratoga!

764
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,940
Mikael. Vladimir.

765
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:34,770
Hey! Hey, Saul! Saul!

766
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,360
Mr. Benedict, please.

767
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:42,870
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

768
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,960
Lift them up, please.

769
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:05,180
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

770
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:09,270
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

771
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,440
...for a period of 24 hours.

772
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,320
-I cannot allow you into the vault.
-Why not?

773
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:21,070
Insurance, for one. Security. But,
most of all, I just don't trust you.

774
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:23,740
Excuse me.

775
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:32,370
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

776
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,420
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

777
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:41,050
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

778
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,680
Those are my terms. Yes or no?

779
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:47,850
You leave me no choice.

780
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,100
Dude, don't do that in
front of the pinch.

781
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:42,030
Deep breaths. You 'll do fine.

782
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,820
-Thank you.
-No sweat. You 're a natural.

783
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,240
But don 't screw up.

784
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:57,330
-Who gets the penne?
-Right here.

785
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,590
You ready?

786
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,350
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

787
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,310
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

788
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,060
Don't let me keep you.

789
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:19,060
-Mr. Zerga.
-Mr. Benedict.

790
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,780
Linus, you're up.

791
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:29,280
Got him.

792
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,160
Mr. Benedict.

793
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:34,910
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

794
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,580
I need two minutes of your time.

795
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:40,790
-Anything for the NGC.
-Thanks.

796
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,880
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

797
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,740
-You make the deposit when?
-At your signal.

798
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:09,950
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

799
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:13,620
How does that feel?
You all right?

800
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:16,580
Want something to read?
A magazine?

801
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,750
All right. Counting down.

802
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,420
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

803
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:25,800
This just came to our attention today.

804
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:29,090
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my....

805
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,600
It's long.

806
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,810
If he is who you say he is.

807
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:45,230
You been at the commission long?

808
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,860
-About 18 months.
-You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

809
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:54,330
Not since he died last year.

810
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:02,750
Ramon Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

811
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,670
What's going on here?

812
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,420
-It's come to our attention--
-We should speak off the floor.

813
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,300
Charlie.

814
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,030
Thank you.

815
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,330
-No. I want you out of here.
-Give me one moment.

816
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,170
-I've had it. I want you gone.
-Tess, come here.

817
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,130
You're up to something.

818
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:50,420
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

819
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:54,010
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

820
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,850
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

821
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,400
Goodbye.

822
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,370
You be good.

823
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,090
-Mr. Ocean.
-Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

824
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,300
I thought he might.

825
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:43,770
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

826
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,860
You're Frank Catton, of
the Tropicana, the Desert Inn...

827
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:53,360
...and the New York State
Penitentiary system. Are you not?

828
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:59,200
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

829
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:03,660
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know--

830
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,120
Goddamn cracker.

831
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,750
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

832
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,880
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

833
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:17,550
-You wanna throw me on the street.
-I'm doing my job.

834
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,600
Want me to get on the table and dance?

835
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,230
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

836
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:28,940
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it whitejack!

837
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:36,450
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

838
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:40,160
-Yeah, right.
-What a horrible thing to say!

839
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:47,580
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored--

840
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:51,840
-No! I didn't mean it!
-Okay. Come on, sit down.

841
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,970
-Sit down.
-You better talk to him.

842
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:58,050
-He's got it.
-Sit down.

843
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,010
Virgil. Turk. Deliver the package.

844
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:15,190
-Where's your card?
-I lost it.

845
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,200
-You serious?
-I'm so stupid.

846
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,120
-You are so stupid! You know that?
-Hey!

847
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:24,160
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

848
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:28,120
-Hey! Keep it down.
-Sorry. Sorry.

849
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:31,960
-Where did this come from?
-High roller's room.

850
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,710
-It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
-Joe, take this inside.

851
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,680
-Count room?
-No, to the vault.

852
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:42,350
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

853
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:47,100
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

854
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,350
-Stupid.
-Jeez!

855
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,240
Yo! Hold that, please.

856
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:04,990
-There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
-Wonderful.

857
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,580
That's my cue.

858
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,590
Give Basher the go.

859
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:18,260
Bash, what's your status?

860
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:21,970
-Bash!
-Easy. No need to shout, guv'ner.

861
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,140
-What's your status?
-I'm nearly there.

862
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,950
Come on, come on.

863
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:50,000
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

864
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:53,210
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

865
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:54,710
Sir?

866
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,090
-Cracker!
-Oh, dear God!

867
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:10,930
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

868
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,060
-Know the way back?
-I do.

869
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:15,400
Good.

870
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,860
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

871
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,610
Sorry!

872
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,790
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

873
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,380
No cameras in this room, huh?

874
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,260
Yeah.

875
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,970
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

876
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,900
He's not coming, is he?

877
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:09,370
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you two to talk things over.

878
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,330
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

879
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:20,500
"I love you, you love me."
"I miss you, you miss me."

880
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:24,010
That went well, but then
I went to this party....

881
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,560
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 11 a.m...

882
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,600
...so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

883
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:39,480
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice."

884
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,440
Oh, shit.

885
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,990
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

886
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,780
I am very satisfied.

887
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:58,420
-Are you all right, sir?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

888
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,840
All right.

889
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,930
Jesus!

890
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:10,850
Bruiser!

891
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:15,480
-Not until later!
-Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

892
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,230
It's all right.

893
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,820
-How's your wife?
-Pregnant again.

894
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:26,400
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

895
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:58,850
-You're almost there, Linus.
-Who's that guy?

896
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,310
-I got a bogey in west corridor.
-Mr. Zerga!

897
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:10,110
-Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
-Put this under his head.

898
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,330
Going to video now.

899
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,830
--to the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

900
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,660
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

901
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,510
Oh, Jesus!

902
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:37,180
-Did you really think I'd sit this out?
-You didn't trust me?

903
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:38,850
I do now.

904
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,020
Come on.

905
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,880
Someone call for a doctor?

906
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:25,860
-How'd you get here?
-Had to give a friend two million.

907
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:30,860
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

908
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:36,950
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

909
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,410
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

910
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,000
Come on, man! Breathe!

911
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,790
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

912
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,640
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

913
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:01,810
-Dude, I told you to hurry.
-Don't do that. Just don't.

914
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,980
I didn't tell you to hurry?

915
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:07,690
Come on, get up! Get up!

916
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:14,860
Had enough yet?

917
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,680
-These things are gonna hold us, right?
-They should.

918
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:02,450
Livingston, we're set.

919
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,120
-Livingston, we're set.
-Basher, we're set.

920
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,210
Hang on a minute, chief.

921
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:12,210
We don 't have one.
Yen 's gonna suffocate.

922
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:15,380
Then you should
leave off bothering me, okay?

923
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,280
All right, crack them.

924
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:26,830
Go.

925
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,960
Shit!

926
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,210
Cut it.

927
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,490
Hey!

928
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:08,370
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

929
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:12,170
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

930
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,510
Get your coat. Get your coat.

931
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,390
Look, this is crazy! What...?

932
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,480
Not yet. Not yet.

933
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:20,360
Go ahead.

934
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:26,490
-You think Yen made it out okay?
-I'm sure he'll be fine.

935
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,370
How we doing?

936
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:33,160
Okay, I guess.

937
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:54,730
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $160 million behind this door.

938
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:57,190
-Let's get him out.
-Yeah.

939
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:10,120
-10 says he shorts it.
-No bet.

940
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:12,040
Try him again.

941
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:45,150
Okay.

942
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,660
Hey. Where we at, boys?

943
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:58,920
-Pins and floor sensors, now.
-Blinding.

944
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,260
Here we go.

945
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,890
Counting down from 20. Now.

946
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,480
Twenty...

947
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:27,400
-Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
-Ten...

948
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,650
...nine, eight...

949
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:34,030
-Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
-Do not blow the door!

950
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,960
...two, one.

951
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,380
What's wrong?

952
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,090
Something....

953
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:05,230
Did you check the batteries?

954
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,780
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second--

955
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:15,200
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

956
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,310
Yen?

957
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:47,400
Where the fuck you been?

958
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,860
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

959
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:06,330
That is the sexiest thing
I've ever seen.

960
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,960
Rusty, you're up.

961
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:26,100
-You gonna answer that?
-I don't have a cell phone.

962
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,900
This isn't mine.

963
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:35,280
See who it is.

964
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,240
-Hello?
-May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?

965
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:42,000
It's for you.

966
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:50,210
-Who the hell is this?
-The man who 's robbing you.

967
01:30:55,180 --> 01:31:00,510
-What's going on in the vault?
-Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

968
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,220
Show me.

969
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:07,310
-You're mistaken.
-Watching your monitors?

970
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,900
Okay, keep watching.

971
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,700
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

972
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,330
-Find out how much money's down there.
-Yes, sir.

973
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,640
Tess?

974
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,850
Tess?

975
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:49,560
Perhaps you should....

976
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,820
Perhaps I should what?

977
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:56,610
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

978
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,250
All right, you proved your point.

979
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:12,540
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

980
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:17,590
-Maybe.
-Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?

981
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:21,760
You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?

982
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:26,060
-No. You'll carry it out for us.
-Why would I do that?

983
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:27,930
Look at your monitor.

984
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:34,320
As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $ 160 million...

985
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:38,610
...in your vault tonight.
We 're only packing up half that.

986
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:43,070
The other half we 're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.

987
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:47,580
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

988
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:51,420
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

989
01:32:55,210 --> 01:33:01,180
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $160 million publicly.

990
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,680
Your decision. Hi.

991
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,650
Make the call.

992
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:22,820
911 emergency response.

993
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,200
-Where's Danny?
-He's fine. He's in good form.

994
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:31,210
-He asks that you go up and watch TV.
-He does?

995
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:36,460
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

996
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,380
-Okay.
-It's alright, Tess.

997
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,550
-You have a deal.
-I promise.

998
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,220
Fantastic. Here's what you do:

999
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,560
The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.

1000
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:53,650
It will rise to your cages.

1001
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:58,020
Three of your guards will carry
the bags out into the casino.

1002
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:03,990
If they take more than 20 seconds to
reach the floor, or there's a switch...

1003
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,780
...we'll blow all the money.

1004
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:11,870
-He's in the casino by the slots.
-Of course I am.

1005
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:17,590
I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: mini bar.

1006
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,920
Once the guards
hit the casino floor...

1007
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:27,510
...a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.

1008
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:33,020
If anyone so much as approaches the
driver's door, we 'll blow everything.

1009
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:39,190
When I hear the van is away and
the money secure, my men will leave.

1010
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,030
Once their safety is confirmed,
you 'll get your vault.

1011
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:45,530
The S.W.A.T. team is here.

1012
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,700
All right.

1013
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:54,080
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1014
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:55,670
I would.

1015
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,000
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1016
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:03,590
Run and hide, asshole. Run and hide.

1017
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,850
If you're picked up buying a $100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

1018
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:14,350
...I'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

1019
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,310
...rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1020
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:23,360
So, my advice to you again
is this: run and hide.

1021
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:26,400
That is all that I ask.

1022
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,390
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1023
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,190
I want my vault
back before that van hits the tarmac.

1024
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:10,200
Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.

1025
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,000
Ready.

1026
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:19,620
Cutting power now.

1027
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,130
Do it.

1028
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,260
Breaching elevator doors now.

1029
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,340
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1030
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:33,140
Wait a minute.

1031
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:35,220
Guys! Guys!
Someone 's here!

1032
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:37,890
-Take him down, now!
-I got him!

1033
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,810
-Lights! We need power now!
-Give it to him.

1034
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:56,290
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1035
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,670
It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.

1036
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:04,590
Continuing search for survivors.

1037
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,630
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1038
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,970
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1039
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,720
Yes, sir.

1040
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:34,410
Get out of the van, now. Now!

1041
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:40,660
Tires. Tires.

1042
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:59,640
Our search yielded no suspects.

1043
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:03,980
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1044
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:09,440
-Take your men out.
-May I suggest you--?

1045
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,150
Now.

1046
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,570
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1047
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,420
Walsh, where are we with the van?

1048
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:46,650
I just want to try
something for a second.

1049
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,280
There's nobody inside.

1050
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:56,910
-I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
-Enough monkey business.

1051
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,740
Do it already.

1052
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:17,300
Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.

1053
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:18,510
And?

1054
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,100
They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.

1055
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:23,850
What do you mean?

1056
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:28,770
They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.

1057
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:36,240
Walsh?

1058
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:39,240
Cue up the tape to the robbery.

1059
01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:43,500
Yes, sir. I'm looking at the tape now.

1060
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:47,870
Does it say "Bellagio "
on the vault floor?

1061
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,670
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1062
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:55,010
We had it installed Tuesday.

1063
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:58,800
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1064
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:00,390
What?

1065
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:06,310
It was staged.
Somebody made a duplicate of my vault.

1066
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:10,650
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1067
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:15,610
I don 't understand.
What happened to all that money?

1068
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,500
Make the call.

1069
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:37,090
911 emergency response.

1070
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,010
-Night goggles on.
-Clear.

1071
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,680
Prepare to cut power.

1072
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:52,310
Breaching elevator doors now.

1073
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,980
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1074
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:57,320
Wait a minute.

1075
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:59,320
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1076
01:40:59,610 --> 01:41:02,370
-Take him down, now!
-I got him!

1077
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,210
Open the door.

1078
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:02,510
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1079
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,310
Pick him up.

1080
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:20,490
Did you have a hand in this?

1081
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:24,070
Did I have my hand in what?

1082
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,750
I'll ask you one more time.

1083
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:33,250
Did you have your hand in this?

1084
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:40,130
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1085
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:46,010
Okay.

1086
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,060
You're free to go.

1087
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,930
Show him out.

1088
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:02,240
-Hello.
-Turn to channel 88.

1089
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,200
Who is this?

1090
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:15,960
What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?

1091
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:17,670
Stop.

1092
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,100
I'll give you one last chance.

1093
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,430
Where 's my money?

1094
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:36,650
What if I said you could
get your money back...

1095
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:39,730
...if you 'd give up Tess?

1096
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:42,280
What would you say?

1097
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,450
I would say yes.

1098
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,830
All right.

1099
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:57,790
I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.

1100
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,380
Anybody pulls any job in the
Western U. S., he knows about it.

1101
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:06,930
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1102
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,350
You know a guy.

1103
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:21,020
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1104
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:22,690
Yes, sir.

1105
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:50,050
Tess.

1106
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:53,510
Tess.

1107
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,680
You of all people should know, Terry.

1108
01:44:56,890 --> 01:45:00,730
In your hotel,
there's always someone watching.

1109
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,750
Wait!

1110
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:44,920
Wait!

1111
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,340
Wait, that's my husband!

1112
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:56,220
-Danny.
-Tess, I told you...

1113
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:59,430
...l knew what I was doing.

1114
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:01,850
I didn't.

1115
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:03,810
All right, let's go.

1116
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:06,860
How long will you be?

1117
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:09,570
About three to six months, I guess.

1118
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,040
I hope you were the groom.

1119
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:14,000
Ted Nugent called,
he wants his shirt back.

1120
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:26,010
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1121
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:28,100
I blew it all on the suit.

1122
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:32,480
-Where are they?
-Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1123
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:36,440
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1124
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:41,450
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1125
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:53,870
-Hi.
-Hi.

1126
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,420
Rusty needs a girl.

1127
01:50:55,630 --> 01:50:58,460
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1128
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:02,050
You said that you sold this.

1129
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,930
I said that.

1130
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:05,640
Liar.

1131
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:08,810
Thief.
