1
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:52,851
Here we see the seals heading upstream.
This is unheard of this time of year.

2
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,419
Now, we take you to Yokohama.

3
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:07,158
People are discovering a lot of strange
things lately, including oversize fish.

4
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:14,841
Also, reports of kidnappings
and rape are on the rise...

5
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:17,036
That's some weird stuff.

6
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:20,208
The world sure is crazy.

7
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,185
Ya know...

8
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:21,776
Yes?

9
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:23,545
I need another drink.

10
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:25,956
Please stop it.

11
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:27,357
Just one more.

12
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:31,225
Save some for the other customers.

13
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:35,659
There aren't many other customers.

14
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:37,069
You're right.

15
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,039
I'm always right. Remember that.

16
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:53,219
Human-like lifeforms have been spotted.

17
00:01:58,962 --> 00:01:59,758
And the police?

18
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:00,930
It's only between us.

19
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:04,636
This is difficult. We're not "ultra police".

20
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:05,967
Hear me out.

21
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:14,581
America has had reports of similar sightings.

22
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,218
No one knows for sure what they are.

23
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,413
You believe it?

24
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:27,956
Our defense force is ordered
to investigate these incidents.

25
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:33,192
We cannot panic the public, so all
investigations must be in secret.

26
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:39,304
We're leaving it to the two of you to solve the case.

27
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,613
We have no other choice.

28
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,583
Do you accept?

29
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:52,583
Oikawa-san...

30
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,011
I don't know.

31
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:56,796
Are you afraid?

32
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:59,493
You won't have much backup in the field.

33
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,265
This is crazy.

34
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,962
I feel like an idiot.

35
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,130
Super Power Sentai!

36
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:30,624
Aleki Thunder!

37
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,970
But, I'm your mother!

38
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:43,375
You're lying!

39
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,525
Damn you. I'll get you now.

40
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,211
Fire!

41
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,416
I won't allow you to do what you want!

42
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,357
What was all that?

43
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,832
Whatever...

44
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,753
Ota, it hurts. It hurts.

45
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:18,529
Please stop it.

46
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,018
Idiot.

47
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:20,895
It's camouflage.

48
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:22,261
Eh?

49
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,565
It's weird for two men to be in the same apartment.

50
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:29,340
This is less suspicious.

51
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,838
Ah, now I understand.

52
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,007
I'll be more careful.

53
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,710
What a dump!

54
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:41,121
Give me the lunch.

55
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:41,610
Yes.

56
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:47,327
Please don't do anything weird.

57
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:48,930
Idiot.

58
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,195
No worries. No worries.

59
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:56,173
Are our orders here?

60
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:57,401
Yes, it's here.

61
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:04,916
The alien lifeform in Yokohama
gives off a certain sound wave...

62
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:05,712
Skip that.

63
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,018
Yes?

64
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,247
Do you have a girlfriend now?

65
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,154
Yes, I do.

66
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,526
It gives off a wave...

67
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:14,550
Enough of that.

68
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,428
What do we do when we detect the wave?

69
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:22,763
Call headquarters.

70
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:23,896
Understood.

71
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:28,735
What are you doing?

72
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,636
Calling headquarters.

73
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,213
Alien.

74
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:41,925
I have a girlfriend now. Really.

75
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:43,788
We've been dating for one year.

76
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,390
Please wait for love.

77
00:06:48,034 --> 00:07:06,789
This evening in Yokohama, a
criminal wearing a crab mask...

78
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,881
Is it good, Kazuki?

79
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:29,775
Starting today, I will be your regular teacher.

80
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,048
No way.

81
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,437
Your father is your teacher! Idiot!

82
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:51,133
Pathetic! Pathetic!

83
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,141
Get lost!

84
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,642
Cut the crap! Pathetic! Get lost!

85
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,278
Kazuki...

86
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:08,053
Just give me more time.

87
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,058
But I...

88
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,828
It will all work out in time.

89
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,347
Hey, where are you going?

90
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:26,041
Out.

91
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:27,642
Wadda ya mean "out"?

92
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,415
You can't go out.

93
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:30,684
Why not?

94
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:32,580
Because...

95
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,725
You still have chores to do.

96
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:37,091
I'm going.

97
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:43,768
I'm telling you you can't go out. It's a school night.

98
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:44,996
I'm home.

99
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,704
You going out?

100
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:47,501
Yeah.

101
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,005
I see.

102
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,108
Let me give you some money...

103
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,243
Thanks. I'm going.

104
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:04,990
What?

105
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,493
You're home early...

106
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,559
I'm home.

107
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,697
What a pain...

108
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,134
No one listens...

109
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:22,435
Midori is at that age...

110
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,012
I guess it can't be helped.

111
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:50,741
Yes!

112
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,409
Black and White Ecstasy!

113
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,809
Zebraman!

114
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:33,991
Zebra Screeeew Punch!

115
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,468
Zebra Back Kick!

116
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,138
Zebra Bomber!

117
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,294
You're not gonna...

118
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,958
keep me down!

119
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,171
Not again!

120
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:37,829
Prof. Ichikawa.

121
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,528
Yes?

122
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:44,577
This is Asano Shinpei-kun. A transfer student.

123
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:49,515
Transfer student?

124
00:11:55,225 --> 00:12:02,132
Don't scare him. Do your best.

125
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:06,329
Yes. I got it.

126
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,071
I'll leave you three alone. Bye.

127
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,311
Nice to meet you.

128
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:16,771
This is our newest teacher, Prof. Ichikawa.

129
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:19,614
Nice to meet you.

130
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:24,857
We'll be sure to treat you great.

131
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:27,788
He's normal.

132
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,691
What?

133
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:37,696
Even though he can't walk, he's
still a regular junior high student.

134
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,172
Excuse me.

135
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:48,216
So, Asano-kun, let's go.

136
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:49,282
Yes.

137
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:50,212
Take care.

138
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:56,121
Okay, from today we have a
new class mate. Asano-kun.

139
00:12:57,197 --> 00:13:00,190
I'm Shinpei Asano. Nice to meet you.

140
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,995
Nice to meet you.

141
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:06,101
That's good everyone.

142
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,840
His paralysis was very sudden.

143
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,682
All the hospitals we went to didn't understand it.

144
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,619
Each day I wonder if he'll ever be able to stand again.

145
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:27,996
His dad?

146
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,402
I'm a single parent.

147
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:33,468
Sorry.

148
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,508
It's no problem.

149
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,778
I see. Sorry.

150
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,017
Professor...

151
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:49,017
I don't want him to be treated special.

152
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:55,123
I don't want any bad things to happen.

153
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,361
What do you mean, "bad things"?

154
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,203
Other students may resent him.

155
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,378
I understand.

156
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,584
I'll treat him like any other student.

157
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:23,628
Thank you.

158
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,582
Hey...

159
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,414
What?

160
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,723
What kind of person are you, Kitahara-kun?

161
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:51,094
I may not look it, but I'm a ghost-man.

162
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,187
Really?

163
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,024
Yeah.

164
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,727
No way.

165
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,296
Then prove it.

166
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,239
Okay. Here.

167
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,292
It's a white panda?

168
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,396
How'd you get it?

169
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,904
I told you I'm a ghost man.

170
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,532
It's really cute.

171
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:35,576
Hey, hey. What does your father do?

172
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:42,019
Ah! A school teacher!

173
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:47,488
It really sucks. He's not even popular.

174
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,569
It's my dad's fault that little brother is picked on...

175
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,701
And mom is unhappy...

176
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:59,903
Really?

177
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:03,776
Yes. It really is his fault.

178
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,610
So, are we done?

179
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,520
No way. One more time.

180
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:14,921
One more time.

181
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:16,727
Yes, yes.

182
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:17,989
Yes, yes.

183
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:19,129
Yes, yes.

184
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:20,523
Yes, yes.

185
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,075
I could just go to the corner and buy some juice...

186
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,553
No, no, no...

187
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,623
I might catch cold.

188
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,356
Teacher.

189
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,225
I finished.

190
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:46,960
Yes.

191
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,200
Teacher, do like sports?

192
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:22,937
To be honest, not really.

193
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:28,815
Hey, what were you working on in class?

194
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,987
Who was it?

195
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:38,594
Did you draw it?

196
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,033
It's Zebraman.

197
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,063
You know him?

198
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,509
Uh... yeah.

199
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:55,114
I watched him on TV when I was in Junior High.

200
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:08,698
Now, everyone, let's all watch
Zebraman's TV preview together.

201
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:22,481
In the year 2010, a mysterious hero appears.

202
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,311
Zebraaaaman!

203
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:29,947
Fight, Zebraman!

204
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,198
Fly, Zebraman!

205
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,606
Black and White Ecstasy!

206
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:46,771
Zebraman!

207
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:56,152
Jyumonji Yuzuru defends the
Earth against evil alien invaders!

208
00:20:57,024 --> 00:21:06,764
The series was cancelled after only 13
episodes, but fans still remember it.

209
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:12,870
There's a lot of news about it on the internet.

210
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:15,170
Turn on the Black and White!

211
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,008
Here's some printouts.

212
00:21:30,462 --> 00:21:36,868
Zebraman isn't just about a super hero,

213
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,905
It's about believing in your dreams.

214
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:58,321
Whether we had a color TV or not,

215
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:06,303
we would still sing the theme song after it was over.

216
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,503
That's really good.

217
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,945
Yeah, it is.

218
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:15,680
It's great, teacher.

219
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:18,310
That you remember this show.

220
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:22,917
I feel like I'm talking with my father.

221
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,596
Ah. What about the main character?

222
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,764
He was a junior high school teacher.

223
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,141
A teacher like me.

224
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:50,181
But, my students don't really take me seriously.

225
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:06,506
Maybe I should practice my yelling at them?

226
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:12,475
Teacher, do you know what year this is?

227
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:15,515
This year?

228
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:19,753
It's 2010.

229
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:31,334
That's right. It's the same year
that Zebraman took place.

230
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:44,447
Asano.

231
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:45,710
Yes?

232
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:55,093
From today, can I call you Asano?

233
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,067
Yes.

234
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,900
Hey, I wonder...

235
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:29,602
If we find this lifeform...

236
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:30,328
Yes.

237
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:32,231
Let's beat its head in.

238
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:33,903
No way.

239
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:35,910
We have to follow orders.

240
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,495
But...

241
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:38,310
Yes?

242
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:41,684
I feel like spoiled milk.

243
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:45,039
Air conditioner?

244
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,257
No air conditioner.

245
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,053
What?

246
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:50,957
There's no space for one...

247
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,139
Prof. Ichikawa...

248
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,817
Yes?

249
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:18,719
I think it's good.

250
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:19,887
What is?

251
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:23,465
You haven't heard anything.

252
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:32,169
Today, Prof. Ichikawa will go
on patrol with Prof. Ippongi.

253
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:35,044
Nice to meet you!

254
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:38,411
Everyone, count on me.

255
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:40,075
Hello.

256
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:55,230
What are you guys doing here?
It's late. Go home, go home!

257
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,575
Are you sure that's okay?

258
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:03,206
What do you mean? It is for their own good.

259
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:05,743
Professor, are you hungry?

260
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,288
Have some, have some.

261
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:18,153
The thing I hate the most is perverts.

262
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:22,996
At least yakuza punks live by a code of honor.

263
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:27,675
But perverts, I can never forgive them.

264
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:28,903
Now, I'll eat.

265
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:32,673
It's really good.

266
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,785
It is good.

267
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:39,085
Ah yes, well you see...

268
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,050
I'm an expert on this kind of food.

269
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:49,198
But my real passion is to be...

270
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:53,300
An English teacher at a girl's school.

271
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:56,239
But I'm so embarassed!

272
00:26:57,544 --> 00:26:59,945
So what's the problem?

273
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:03,412
The problem is the Sailor Suit.

274
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,350
Why is that a problem?

275
00:27:07,422 --> 00:27:08,753
It's difficult to walk.

276
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,756
That's it?

277
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:30,013
Oh look! It's 9 o'clock. We'd better get going.

278
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:49,901
It's still bad.

279
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:52,930
But I want to show Asano.

280
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:59,048
Asano, Asano, Asano...

281
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:03,252
Nakayama-cho 2-chome 553

282
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:07,553
Nice neighborhood.

283
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:13,564
What? That's not it.

284
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:22,507
Not Asano's address. Sakura-machi 30.

285
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,445
What?

286
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:31,549
Andoh.

287
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:35,890
Andoh?

288
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:41,759
Andoh.

289
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:48,703
Sakura-machi 3-chome 15. Asano.

290
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:55,975
There's no doubt.

291
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,009
Can't be seen like this.

292
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:34,253
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired...

293
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:39,625
I'm a fan.

294
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,061
What are you?

295
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,040
Zebraman.

296
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:56,954
I'm Zebraman.

297
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:03,061
I'm Zebraman.

298
00:31:04,232 --> 00:31:04,823
Die!

299
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,026
That hurt.

300
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:41,867
Be careful.

301
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:43,141
Be careful.

302
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:02,590
What?

303
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,560
What the hell?

304
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:47,216
Hey, Hey! A wave reaction.

305
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:49,414
Let's go.

306
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:50,443
What?

307
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:53,289
Hurry up!

308
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,118
Zebra Screw Punch.

309
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,771
It's Zebraman...

310
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:10,036
Hey, what's going on?

311
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,640
Ah, nothing.

312
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:15,178
Nothing, huh?

313
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:17,583
It's late.

314
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:19,477
You're alone?

315
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:22,557
Is your mom nearby?

316
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:25,385
Seigawa. Seigawa!

317
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:25,894
Yes!

318
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:49,255
There was another murder.

319
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:53,990
It seems connected to the others.

320
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:57,896
Of course, we want everyone to be on guard.

321
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,465
That's it.

322
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,844
The victim last night seemed
to be covered in green goo.

323
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:19,357
I heard it from my friends,
even though the police deny it.

324
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,458
And there's nothing about it on TV.

325
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,224
Hey! What are you doing?

326
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:28,833
Zebraman Punch!

327
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,403
Take this.

328
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,543
I'm good.

329
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,681
This way?

330
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:48,862
Take a look at the body.

331
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:59,139
Ready? It's a bit hard to look at.

332
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:11,159
How could that have happened?

333
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:17,500
Look at the wound...

334
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,068
Oikawa-san?

335
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:19,557
Hmm?

336
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:20,600
Nothing.

337
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,238
I'm done.

338
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,830
I don't get it.

339
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:23,971
I'm done.

340
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,709
Burn it.

341
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,306
Ready!

342
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,647
Light up!

343
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,089
Fire!

344
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:55,438
The cases seem to be around
the general area of this school.

345
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,982
Can I speak freely about the cases?

346
00:37:59,983 --> 00:38:05,012
Yes, of course. You can ask me anything.

347
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,627
What's weird about these cases is that

348
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:14,356
They haven't been reported
on TV or in the newspapers.

349
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:18,696
Hey, what are you implying?

350
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:23,535
Last night, a lot of people
were unaware of the danger.

351
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:27,407
Do you intend to let more people die?

352
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:29,312
Prof. Kyoto...

353
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,888
Are you afraid of something?

354
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:40,153
Well, there might be a panic...

355
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:43,291
Our first concern is for our students.

356
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:49,397
Our concern is to solve the cases.

357
00:38:51,343 --> 00:38:54,244
Professor, these two cases are...

358
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,039
I won't answer you!

359
00:38:57,217 --> 00:38:59,082
You make me sick!

360
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:22,439
I wonder if it was the real Zebraman?

361
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:25,479
Asano-san...

362
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:31,046
I hope that I can meet him again.

363
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:33,486
I see.

364
00:39:34,994 --> 00:39:35,983
I see.

365
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:46,102
You can watch Zebraman on here.

366
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:48,736
Really?

367
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,281
It's the first episode of Zebraman.

368
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:59,050
I remember, I remember. It's Zebraman!

369
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:04,093
Ah! There! There! The Screw Punch, right?

370
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,830
I'm home.

371
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,466
Welcome home.

372
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,268
Ah, professor...

373
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:15,133
Ah, excuse me.

374
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:17,235
He was teaching me.

375
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,980
Professor Ichikawa is a fan of Zebraman!

376
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:27,546
It makes me feel very nostalgic.

377
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:30,083
Now I'll make dinner.

378
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:30,814
Yes.

379
00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:35,762
Ah, no, no. I should go.

380
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,177
Please.

381
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:53,550
Thanks.

382
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:01,660
What is it?

383
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,691
Professor, you should eat your vegetables.

384
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:08,595
Oh, really?

385
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:13,204
Well, the truth is...

386
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:43,004
Need help?

387
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:45,211
I got it.

388
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:47,206
I see.

389
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:51,609
Your family?

390
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:58,126
Oh, that's right. I forgot. I should go.

391
00:41:58,895 --> 00:42:02,662
That's not what I meant.

392
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,204
A wife and two kids.

393
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:11,070
I see.

394
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:14,139
What about you?

395
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:20,649
His father committed suicide.

396
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:29,490
I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you.

397
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:52,319
He was a junior at the university hospital.

398
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:02,827
My son saw the whole thing.

399
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,372
He jumped from the building.

400
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:10,843
Yes.

401
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,620
I really should go home.

402
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,647
Zebra Nurse!!

403
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,028
Please.

404
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:58,760
Don't worry, Zebraman.

405
00:45:43,624 --> 00:45:44,613
Zebraman.

406
00:46:13,826 --> 00:46:14,622
Dream?

407
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:23,661
Damn.

408
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:29,540
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

409
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:46,764
Zebra Bomber!

410
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:26,781
White and Black Man!

411
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:27,713
No!

412
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:30,986
Horse Man!

413
00:48:30,987 --> 00:48:32,112
No!

414
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,896
Zebra Double Kick!

415
00:48:53,946 --> 00:48:55,140
Ah, sorry, sorry.

416
00:48:56,148 --> 00:48:57,672
Where were we...

417
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:03,090
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

418
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:03,886
Teacher...

419
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:06,951
The time is up.

420
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:14,193
Sorry, sorry. Let's go.

421
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:20,303
A striped man?

422
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:30,617
Well, if there is such a man running
around like that, then he must be an idiot.

423
00:49:30,956 --> 00:49:32,821
Zebraman isn't an idiot!

424
00:49:34,527 --> 00:49:35,551
What-man?

425
00:49:37,997 --> 00:49:38,929
Asano-kun...

426
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,162
Did you see him?

427
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:54,275
No, I didn't.

428
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:57,748
But, Zebraman isn't an idiot.

429
00:49:58,221 --> 00:49:59,745
He's a savior.

430
00:50:04,395 --> 00:50:05,262
Hey...

431
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:07,231
I'll be there soon.

432
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:11,734
What did Asano tell you?

433
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:13,336
That kid...

434
00:50:16,843 --> 00:50:18,037
What are you doing?

435
00:50:21,147 --> 00:50:21,944
That kid...

436
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:25,112
What he said...

437
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:27,513
Cut the crap!

438
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:33,926
I have to solve these cases! I don't
have time to waste with this crap!

439
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,313
I'm trying to analyze its programme.

440
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:50,975
Yes.

441
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:53,985
Mr. Kanda.

442
00:50:55,755 --> 00:50:57,621
I think it's impossible to find out any more.

443
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,393
But headquarters is waiting for results.

444
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:04,128
Having to examine in secret slows me down.

445
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,326
What we need to find out...

446
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:10,337
Is how this is spread from person to person.

447
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:14,334
It can spread from Yokohama
to cover the whole country.

448
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,642
Please don't rush me, Oikawa-san.

449
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:22,850
Enough of this crap!

450
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:28,014
Whose idea was this anyway?!

451
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:42,838
We're not getting anywhere. It's
beyond human comprehension.

452
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:12,737
What do you mean transfer?

453
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:15,678
To another school?

454
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:19,885
We had no choice. The kids are in danger.

455
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:21,800
Danger?

456
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:22,513
Yes.

457
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,922
Shinpei Asano is in danger.

458
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,661
I don't understand what you mean?

459
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,532
If the students are in danger...

460
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:31,760
You don't have to know.

461
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:37,334
Don't worry. As of tomorrow, they'll be safe.

462
00:52:41,278 --> 00:52:42,111
Prof. Kyoto...

463
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:45,105
The families all agree.

464
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:48,078
What is it you know?

465
00:52:49,487 --> 00:52:50,681
What do you mean?

466
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:58,053
You know something about the case.

467
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:01,627
I'm asking you to stop.

468
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:05,536
It's not just the cases that put the students in danger.

469
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,271
What is it?

470
00:53:14,616 --> 00:53:16,482
What do you know?

471
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:32,872
Excuse me. I'll go fix it.

472
00:53:32,873 --> 00:53:35,041
I'm not done talking with you.

473
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:35,974
But, my hair...

474
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:38,136
Who cares about your hair?

475
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:40,577
I have to go to the toilet.

476
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:42,242
Professor...

477
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:44,683
Why do you need your bag?

478
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:47,414
Is there something in there?

479
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:51,126
Let me see what's inside!

480
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,150
W- what?

481
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:55,630
What could be so important?

482
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,137
Hey, wait!

483
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:07,501
We're not finished!

484
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,167
Eh, uh, eh, uh...

485
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:22,093
Great food and great prices. Have some now.

486
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:42,482
What would you like, kids?

487
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:44,188
Where are your mothers?

488
00:55:45,993 --> 00:55:47,551
What are you doing?

489
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,686
Why'd you do that?

490
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:57,273
Don't eat all that!

491
00:55:57,274 --> 00:55:59,104
Wait! Wait!

492
00:56:01,878 --> 00:56:03,642
Do you guys have money?

493
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:12,486
Stop it, you brats!

494
00:56:24,938 --> 00:56:26,998
Stop it you brats!

495
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:45,463
Hurry, hurry! Help me! Shoot them!

496
00:56:45,464 --> 00:56:47,397
I can't shoot children!

497
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:48,656
What's up?

498
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,597
Chief, there's big trouble.

499
00:56:53,005 --> 00:56:55,303
Come on, stop it.

500
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:32,206
Kazuki?

501
00:57:38,158 --> 00:57:38,749
Wait!

502
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:00,109
Okay, stop.

503
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:41,019
Hey, Kazuki. It's dad. It's your dad!

504
01:00:09,534 --> 01:00:10,660
Stay away!

505
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:14,135
Stay away!

506
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:43,805
Professor!

507
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,308
My son is sick. Where should I take him?

508
01:00:49,948 --> 01:00:51,040
Now is bad.

509
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:52,740
Why?

510
01:00:54,554 --> 01:00:56,852
Someone gave birth to a green baby.

511
01:01:10,138 --> 01:01:11,571
You really helped me.

512
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:14,403
Thank you.

513
01:01:19,483 --> 01:01:20,711
Asano-kun?

514
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:22,808
He's sleeping in his room.

515
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:26,381
I see.

516
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:38,930
Professor?

517
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:43,342
Can I ask you something?

518
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:46,373
Sure.

519
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:01,229
Are you really...

520
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:07,098
Zebraman?

521
01:02:20,387 --> 01:02:21,945
It's true.

522
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:32,262
You were in one of my dreams.

523
01:02:36,906 --> 01:02:42,345
You healed a big wound.

524
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:49,611
I wanted to help you.

525
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:55,917
It seemed so real.

526
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,462
Professor...

527
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:01,697
Today...

528
01:03:04,271 --> 01:03:06,001
I understood it.

529
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,740
The reason why I fight...

530
01:03:15,117 --> 01:03:16,106
Is for dreams.

531
01:03:26,364 --> 01:03:31,359
Not for my dreams, but for...

532
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:34,833
but for his.

533
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:38,104
That's what I believe.

534
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,358
Kazuki? Are you all right?

535
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,262
Are you okay?

536
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:05,035
He's okay.

537
01:04:58,738 --> 01:05:04,371
I'm sorry for before.

538
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:04,544
"There's no more time"

539
01:06:06,684 --> 01:06:10,017
"I leave the rest up to you"

540
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:15,924
"Anything Goes"

541
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,599
Anything goes?

542
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:57,566
Hey, what are you doing?

543
01:06:58,545 --> 01:06:59,239
Hey, what are you doing?

544
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:02,710
I'm looking for Prof. Kyoto.

545
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:04,179
Here?

546
01:07:04,986 --> 01:07:05,975
Yeah, here.

547
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:07,643
I'm there.

548
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:09,784
There?

549
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:12,384
That's close.

550
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:17,988
During the incident that just passed,

551
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:23,873
There was a striped man who helped save the kids.

552
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:30,613
I'm trying to find out who he is.

553
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:43,227
Excuse me.

554
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:50,800
What is this?

555
01:07:52,006 --> 01:07:53,736
It's a dump, right?

556
01:07:55,044 --> 01:07:56,807
A real dump.

557
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:02,046
Is Kyoto okay?

558
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:12,361
Excuse me.

559
01:08:38,828 --> 01:08:39,817
Scripts?

560
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,343
"Car stealing kids"

561
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:57,811
"Crab Man"

562
01:08:58,785 --> 01:09:00,252
"Green Baby"

563
01:09:13,635 --> 01:09:15,603
Zebraman scripts.

564
01:09:17,306 --> 01:09:22,939
What I'm about to tell you is surprising.

565
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:31,679
These scripts contain everything
that's been going on lately.

566
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,520
Crab Man.

567
01:09:35,194 --> 01:09:37,389
Kids stealing cars.

568
01:09:38,898 --> 01:09:40,526
Green baby.

569
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:45,466
Wait a second. I heard nothing about those.

570
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:55,782
But, Prof. Kyoto knew about it all this time.

571
01:10:02,025 --> 01:10:03,994
It's all here.

572
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:08,195
Prof. Kyoto?

573
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:11,131
Yes.

574
01:10:12,637 --> 01:10:15,971
He must know about Zebraman.

575
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:23,980
Hey, did you ever hear anything
strange from the professor's room?

576
01:10:24,651 --> 01:10:27,488
No, I never did.

577
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:32,722
Too bad. I think Kyoto knows what's going on.

578
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,232
I think Kyoto is in alien hands.

579
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,466
Who told you that?

580
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:38,694
Wait a sec!

581
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:45,233
Find him.

582
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,001
Yes.

583
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:59,625
In Yokohama, 34 years ago, a UFO crash-landed.

584
01:11:07,134 --> 01:11:14,803
The aliens mixed in with humans around
the area of the junior high school.

585
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:26,045
Soon after, the alien's began using
the Zebraman scripts for their plans.

586
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:31,621
The program was cancelled early.

587
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:47,173
The UFO aliens used the junior
high school to further their plans.

588
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:54,980
They began to further experiment on humans.

589
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:01,829
Prof. Kyoto began a one man fight against the aliens.

590
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:09,500
That's why he wanted to transfer
the students to another school.

591
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,714
He said...

592
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:18,544
What?

593
01:12:19,852 --> 01:12:21,047
Anything goes.

594
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,259
He believed...

595
01:12:28,896 --> 01:12:30,523
Dreams come true.

596
01:12:54,026 --> 01:13:05,030
Kyoto is an alien. But not just a normal
alien. He's an original alien from the UFO.

597
01:13:09,277 --> 01:13:09,868
Hey.

598
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:11,237
Yes?

599
01:13:15,284 --> 01:13:23,351
We can't let you interfere with
our plans for invasion...

600
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,166
Seigawa...

601
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:09,540
Seigawa-san is dead.

602
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:55,799
I need a bike.

603
01:15:02,676 --> 01:15:04,337
I should have a bike.

604
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:15,489
Heroes always have bikes.

605
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,536
Sorry.

606
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,191
Kazuki...

607
01:16:22,002 --> 01:16:23,333
Your father...

608
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,069
Needs to fly to the sky...

609
01:16:47,898 --> 01:16:48,887
Sorry.

610
01:16:55,675 --> 01:16:56,573
Your mother...

611
01:16:59,145 --> 01:17:00,043
And sister...

612
01:17:04,084 --> 01:17:05,312
Take care of them.

613
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:16,688
Dad...

614
01:17:32,184 --> 01:17:33,310
Do your best.

615
01:19:10,965 --> 01:19:14,493
Did you read the script for the final episode?

616
01:19:15,704 --> 01:19:16,398
No.

617
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,874
How about Asano-kun?

618
01:19:21,811 --> 01:19:24,405
He didn't read it either.

619
01:19:27,685 --> 01:19:29,243
That's good.

620
01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:42,692
I don't think I can fly.

621
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:51,740
When fighting the alien boss,

622
01:19:55,351 --> 01:19:56,283
Zebraman

623
01:19:59,355 --> 01:20:00,687
Gets defeated.

624
01:20:03,794 --> 01:20:05,421
But then...

625
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:10,457
What happens?

626
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:15,534
Zebraman...

627
01:20:19,145 --> 01:20:20,976
Flies into the sky.

628
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,516
Then he...

629
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,553
saves the earth and humanity...

630
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:37,193
From the alien invasion.

631
01:20:43,974 --> 01:20:45,703
That's the final episode.

632
01:20:48,913 --> 01:20:50,881
What the heck is that?

633
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:56,979
Who would watch such a show?

634
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:01,391
You've been practicing flying?

635
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:04,453
Yes.

636
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:06,329
How long?

637
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:09,165
10 days.

638
01:21:25,222 --> 01:21:26,416
I think to fly...

639
01:21:32,564 --> 01:21:33,588
is impossible.

640
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:38,929
I wish I never read that script!

641
01:21:50,351 --> 01:21:52,080
My son believes in you.

642
01:21:54,757 --> 01:21:59,160
He believes that Zebraman will protect the earth.

643
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,826
For my son's sake...

644
01:22:08,339 --> 01:22:08,930
please...

645
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:13,339
learn how to fly!

646
01:22:30,865 --> 01:22:31,763
Miss...

647
01:22:33,368 --> 01:22:34,494
Yes.

648
01:22:38,441 --> 01:22:39,533
Did you...

649
01:22:41,678 --> 01:22:43,009
understand my story?

650
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:47,749
Yes.

651
01:22:57,463 --> 01:23:00,365
There is one man who can help.

652
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:02,700
Who is it?

653
01:23:04,404 --> 01:23:05,633
It's Zebraman.

654
01:23:08,509 --> 01:23:09,533
It's Zebraman!

655
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:13,940
You mean that striped guy?

656
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:18,880
Sounds weird, doesn't it?

657
01:23:19,789 --> 01:23:27,822
But I think he's the only one who can help us.

658
01:23:28,298 --> 01:23:29,630
No need.

659
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:36,233
The order has been given.

660
01:23:38,377 --> 01:23:42,872
Tonight, the Junior High School will be no more.

661
01:23:45,218 --> 01:23:47,278
Our operation will be over.

662
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:54,963
In a moment, the school will cease to exist.

663
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:02,528
I expect your support.

664
01:24:14,352 --> 01:24:16,320
How can you say that?

665
01:24:16,989 --> 01:24:18,650
Everyone has gone crazy.

666
01:24:20,259 --> 01:24:24,128
It's all we can do to survive.

667
01:24:45,188 --> 01:24:46,519
Dad...

668
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:51,453
Do your best.

669
01:24:54,466 --> 01:24:55,990
He believes.

670
01:24:58,237 --> 01:25:00,103
Believes in dreams.

671
01:25:05,379 --> 01:25:11,148
Believe in dreams, believe in dreams.

672
01:26:02,946 --> 01:26:08,419
Why did you come here? If
something bad happened tell me...

673
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:11,321
No, no. I had something important to tell you.

674
01:26:15,026 --> 01:26:16,688
You should not give up.

675
01:26:20,499 --> 01:26:30,968
I really believe that you are a
big hero, defending the earth.

676
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:41,623
You look terrible.

677
01:26:45,562 --> 01:26:48,657
Well, I'm sorry for saying such weird things.

678
01:26:50,268 --> 01:26:51,394
Later.

679
01:26:52,471 --> 01:26:54,234
Take care.

680
01:28:09,059 --> 01:28:10,084
Shinpei?

681
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:13,461
Where are you, Shinpei?

682
01:28:16,135 --> 01:28:17,432
Toilet?

683
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,069
Shinpei!

684
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,444
Please stop, please stop.

685
01:28:58,418 --> 01:28:59,451
What is it?

686
01:28:59,452 --> 01:29:01,647
We're sorry, but the road is closed.

687
01:29:02,088 --> 01:29:03,456
Why?

688
01:29:03,457 --> 01:29:04,981
We're sorry, no one can pass.

689
01:29:05,459 --> 01:29:08,155
But my son went to the school...

690
01:29:10,098 --> 01:29:14,159
Everything is in order here.

691
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:48,134
Please! I need to go to the school!

692
01:30:39,502 --> 01:30:41,163
You're good, Professor.

693
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,200
Clear a path.

694
01:30:47,177 --> 01:30:48,735
Open it, open it.

695
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:15,337
Let's go. To the school. Get on.

696
01:31:15,811 --> 01:31:16,402
Yes.

697
01:32:15,981 --> 01:32:17,209
Asano-san.

698
01:32:25,558 --> 01:32:26,685
Zebraman.

699
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:30,991
Help me, Zebraman!

700
01:33:14,049 --> 01:33:15,812
Do your best, Zebraman!

701
01:35:51,733 --> 01:35:52,427
Great!

702
01:36:30,444 --> 01:36:32,106
Zebraman, look out!

703
01:36:36,151 --> 01:36:37,676
You're not gonna...

704
01:36:38,354 --> 01:36:39,480
keep me down.

705
01:37:13,695 --> 01:37:16,823
Hey? What's going on?

706
01:37:17,065 --> 01:37:17,759
Kazuki!

707
01:37:17,899 --> 01:37:18,730
What?

708
01:37:58,614 --> 01:38:01,311
Now what?

709
01:38:01,551 --> 01:38:08,583
There's only 3 minutes left until the
chopper gets here! Let's clear out!

710
01:38:11,228 --> 01:38:12,326
Shinpei!

711
01:38:12,327 --> 01:38:13,425
Shinpei?

712
01:38:56,381 --> 01:38:57,177
Shinpei!

713
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:44,535
What now?

714
01:39:45,205 --> 01:39:46,103
Fly.

715
01:39:48,442 --> 01:39:50,933
Zebraman, fly and fight.

716
01:39:54,449 --> 01:39:55,347
Asano-san.

717
01:39:56,118 --> 01:39:58,177
Zebraman has to fly.

718
01:39:58,554 --> 01:40:00,420
Zebraman has to fly to the sky.

719
01:40:03,693 --> 01:40:07,460
You have to believe that you can fly.

720
01:41:00,927 --> 01:41:02,155
Asano-san...

721
01:41:05,866 --> 01:41:06,798
See.

722
01:41:10,604 --> 01:41:12,766
Now it's Zebraman's turn.

723
01:41:39,438 --> 01:41:40,871
Zebraman!

724
01:41:42,909 --> 01:41:44,035
Fly!

725
01:41:59,529 --> 01:42:00,612
Shinpei!

726
01:42:00,613 --> 01:42:01,695
Shinpei!

727
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,356
He flew.

728
01:42:42,145 --> 01:42:43,271
Shinpei!

729
01:42:51,188 --> 01:42:52,416
Thank you...

730
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,650
Zebraman.

731
01:46:36,752 --> 01:46:38,083
Hey...

732
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:40,584
Can I ask you something?

733
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:42,689
What?

734
01:46:43,793 --> 01:46:45,955
My mask...

735
01:46:47,264 --> 01:46:50,791
I was finally having some fun.

736
01:46:51,368 --> 01:46:57,001
Yes, yes. Everything is fine now.

737
01:46:58,844 --> 01:47:01,312
Japan is safe!

738
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:09,820
We're here.

739
01:47:24,174 --> 01:47:25,937
Here.

740
01:47:29,346 --> 01:47:36,549
Everyone is waiting for Zebraman.

741
01:48:35,824 --> 01:48:38,076
He looks like a fine man.

742
01:48:38,077 --> 01:48:40,329
He doesn't look like dad?

743
01:48:40,463 --> 01:48:42,522
No way! Don't say such a thing!

744
01:49:22,645 --> 01:49:24,374
Thank you, Zebraman!

745
01:50:12,103 --> 01:50:13,297
Turn on the black and white.
