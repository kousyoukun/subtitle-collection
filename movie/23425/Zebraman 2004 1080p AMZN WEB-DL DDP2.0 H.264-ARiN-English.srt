1
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:52,471
Here we see the seals heading upstream.
This is unheard of this time of year.

2
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:58,071
Now, we take you to Yokohama.

3
00:01:00,313 --> 00:01:06,719
People are discovering a lot of strange
things lately, including oversize fish.

4
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,424
Also, reports of kidnappings
and rape are on the rise...

5
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:16,619
That's some weird stuff.

6
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,790
The world sure is crazy.

7
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:20,766
Ya know...

8
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,358
Yes?

9
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,161
I need another drink.

10
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:26,038
Please stop it.

11
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:26,937
Just one more.

12
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:30,839
Save some for the other customers.

13
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:35,239
There aren't many other customers.

14
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:36,682
You're right.

15
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:38,617
I'm always right. Remember that.

16
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,862
Human-like lifeforms have been spotted.

17
00:01:58,571 --> 00:01:59,368
And the police?

18
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,573
It's only between us.

19
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:04,210
This is difficult. We're
not "ultra police".

20
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,542
Hear me out.

21
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,142
America has had reports
of similar sightings.

22
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:17,790
No one knows for sure what they are.

23
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,019
You believe it?

24
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:27,560
Our defense force is ordered
to investigate these incidents.

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,795
We cannot panic the public, so all
investigations must be in secret.

26
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:38,907
We're leaving it to the two
of you to solve the case.

27
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:43,214
We have no other choice.

28
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,151
Do you accept?

29
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:52,184
Oikawa-san...

30
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,226
I don't know.

31
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:56,429
Are you afraid?

32
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:59,126
You won't have much backup in the field.

33
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:01,794
This is crazy.

34
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:04,527
I feel like an idiot.

35
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:27,724
Super Power Sentai!

36
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,218
Aleki Thunder!

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,528
But, I'm your mother!

38
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:42,966
You're lying!

39
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:58,149
Damn you. I'll get you now.

40
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:07,765
Fire!

41
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,934
I won't allow you to do what you want!

42
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,909
What was all that?

43
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,383
Whatever...

44
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,296
Ota, it hurts. It hurts.

45
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:18,070
Please stop it.

46
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,560
Idiot.

47
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:20,436
It's camouflage.

48
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:21,803
Eh?

49
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:26,141
It's weird for two men to
be in the same apartment.

50
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:28,881
This is less suspicious.

51
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:31,378
Ah, now I understand.

52
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,546
I'll be more careful.

53
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:37,316
What a dump!

54
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:40,726
Give me the lunch.

55
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:41,216
Yes.

56
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:46,899
Please don't do anything weird.

57
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,500
Idiot.

58
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,765
No worries. No worries.

59
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:55,741
Are our orders here?

60
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:56,970
Yes, it's here.

61
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:04,416
The alien lifeform in Yokohama
gives off a certain sound wave...

62
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,213
Skip that.

63
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:06,518
Yes?

64
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:07,747
Do you have a girlfriend now?

65
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:09,688
Yes, I do.

66
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,092
It gives off a wave...

67
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,082
Enough of that.

68
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,994
What do we do when we detect the wave?

69
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,295
Call headquarters.

70
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:23,463
Understood.

71
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:28,266
What are you doing?

72
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,166
Calling headquarters.

73
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,741
Alien.

74
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:41,487
I have a girlfriend now. Really.

75
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:43,383
We've been dating for one year.

76
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:46,951
Please wait for love.

77
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:57,792
This evening in Yokohama, a
criminal wearing a crab mask...

78
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:07,507
Is it good, Kazuki?

79
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:29,294
Starting today,
I will be your regular teacher.

80
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,567
No way.

81
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,011
Your father is your teacher! Idiot!

82
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:50,684
Pathetic! Pathetic!

83
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,690
Get lost!

84
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:57,225
Cut the crap! Pathetic! Get lost!

85
00:07:59,131 --> 00:07:59,826
Kazuki...

86
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:07,567
Just give me more time.

87
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:11,537
But I...

88
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:17,340
It will all work out in time.

89
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:24,890
Hey, where are you going?

90
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,585
Out.

91
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:27,153
Wadda ya mean "out?"

92
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:28,958
You can't go out.

93
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:30,227
Why not?

94
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:32,089
Because...

95
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:35,267
You still have chores to do.

96
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:36,633
I'm going.

97
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:43,308
I'm telling you you can't
go out. It's a school night.

98
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,537
I'm home.

99
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:46,245
You going out?

100
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:47,042
Yeah.

101
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:48,512
I see.

102
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,615
Let me give you some money...

103
00:08:58,257 --> 00:08:59,782
Thanks. I'm going.

104
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:04,461
What?

105
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:10,996
You're home early...

106
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:12,029
I'm home.

107
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,200
What a pain...

108
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,602
No one listens...

109
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,937
Midori is at that age...

110
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,513
I guess it can't be helped.

111
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,272
Yes!

112
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:23,968
Black and White Ecstasy!

113
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,368
Zebraman!

114
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:33,515
Zebra Screeeew Punch!

115
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,023
Zebra Back Kick!

116
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:42,726
Zebra Bomber!

117
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,879
You're not gonna...

118
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,476
keep me down!

119
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:17,686
Not again!

120
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,374
Professor Ichikawa.

121
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:39,074
Yes?

122
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:44,155
This is Asano Shinpei-kun.
A transfer student.

123
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,092
Transfer student?

124
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,639
Don't scare him. Do your best.

125
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,835
Yes. I got it.

126
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:10,577
I'll leave you three alone. Bye.

127
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,818
Nice to meet you.

128
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:16,311
This is our newest teacher,
Professor Ichikawa.

129
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,153
Nice to meet you.

130
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:24,395
We'll be sure to treat you great.

131
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:27,360
He's normal.

132
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:31,227
What?

133
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:37,232
Even though he can't walk, he's
still a regular junior high student.

134
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,707
Excuse me.

135
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,750
So, Asano-kun, let's go.

136
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:48,848
Yes.

137
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:49,779
Take care.

138
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:55,685
Okay, from today we have a
new class mate. Asano-kun.

139
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,789
I'm Shinpei Asano. Nice to meet you.

140
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,492
Nice to meet you.

141
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:05,598
That's good everyone.

142
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:12,336
His paralysis was very sudden.

143
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:17,177
All the hospitals we went
to didn't understand it.

144
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:24,146
Each day I wonder if he'll
ever be able to stand again.

145
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:27,523
His dad?

146
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,928
I'm a single parent.

147
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:32,994
Sorry.

148
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,033
It's no problem.

149
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:41,302
I see. Sorry.

150
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,575
Professor...

151
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:48,541
I don't want him to be treated special.

152
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:54,646
I don't want any bad things to happen.

153
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,951
What do you mean, "bad things"?

154
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,724
Other students may resent him.

155
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:11,864
I understand.

156
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:16,070
I'll treat him like any other student.

157
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:23,145
Thank you.

158
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,132
Hey...

159
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:40,963
What?

160
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:45,270
What kind of person are you, Kitahara-kun?

161
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:50,607
I may not look it, but I'm a ghost-man.

162
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,700
Really?

163
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:53,570
Yeah.

164
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:55,239
No way.

165
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,807
Then prove it.

166
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:01,751
Okay. Here.

167
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:20,767
It's a white panda?

168
00:15:22,073 --> 00:15:22,870
How'd you get it?

169
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,378
I told you I'm a ghost man.

170
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,040
It's really cute.

171
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:35,116
Hey, hey. What does your father do?

172
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,524
Ah! A school teacher!

173
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:46,991
It really sucks. He's not even popular.

174
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:55,106
It's my dad's fault that
little brother is picked on...

175
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,203
And Mum is unhappy...

176
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,404
Really?

177
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:03,242
Yes. It really is his fault.

178
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:08,111
So, are we done?

179
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,021
No way. One more time.

180
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,420
One more time.

181
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,226
Yes, yes.

182
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:17,488
Yes, yes.

183
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:18,628
Yes, yes.

184
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:19,987
Yes, yes.

185
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:35,571
I could just go to the
corner and buy some juice...

186
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,048
No, no, no...

187
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:42,119
I might catch cold.

188
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:40,831
Teacher.

189
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:43,664
I finished.

190
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:46,434
Yes.

191
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:11,774
Teacher, do like sports?

192
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:22,507
To be honest, not really.

193
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:28,419
Hey, what were you working on in class?

194
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,589
Who was it?

195
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:38,196
Did you draw it?

196
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:42,635
It's Zebraman.

197
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,664
You know him?

198
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,110
Uh... yeah.

199
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:54,748
I watched him on TV
when I was in Junior High.

200
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,327
Now, everyone, let's all watch
Zebraman's TV preview together.

201
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:22,109
In the year 2010,
a mysterious hero appears.

202
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,939
Zebraaaaman!

203
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:29,574
Fight, Zebraman!

204
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,891
Fly, Zebraman!

205
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:45,297
Black and White Ecstasy!

206
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:46,463
Zebraman!

207
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:55,806
Jyumonji Yuzuru defends the
Earth against evil alien invaders!

208
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:06,350
The series was cancelled after only 7
episodes, but fans still remember it.

209
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,490
There's a lot of news
about it on the internet.

210
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:14,823
Turn on the Black and White!

211
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,661
Here are some printouts.

212
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:36,483
Zebraman isn't just about a super hero,

213
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:43,553
It's about believing in your dreams.

214
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:57,967
Whether we had a colour TV or not,

215
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:05,913
we would still sing the
theme song after it was over.

216
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,113
That's really good.

217
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:12,520
Yeah, it is.

218
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,313
It's great, teacher.

219
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:17,919
That you remember this show.

220
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:22,558
I feel like I'm talking with my father.

221
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,237
Ah. What about the main character?

222
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,370
He was a junior high school teacher.

223
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:40,746
A teacher like me.

224
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:49,852
But, my students don't
really take me seriously.

225
00:22:56,297 --> 00:23:06,071
Maybe I should practice
my yelling at them?

226
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:12,075
Teacher, do you know what year this is?

227
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:15,114
This year?

228
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,318
It's 2010.

229
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:30,930
That's right. It's the same year
that Zebraman took place.

230
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,075
Asano.

231
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:45,338
Yes?

232
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:54,718
From today, can I call you Asano?

233
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:00,725
Yes.

234
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,487
Hey, I wonder...

235
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:29,224
If we find this lifeform...

236
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:29,947
Yes.

237
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,850
Let's beat its head in.

238
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:33,522
No way.

239
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,529
We have to follow orders.

240
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:37,132
But...

241
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:37,929
Yes?

242
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,302
I feel like spoiled milk.

243
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,706
Air conditioner?

244
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:45,874
No air conditioner.

245
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:46,671
What?

246
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:50,574
There's no space for one...

247
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:08,719
Professor Ichikawa...

248
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,396
Yes?

249
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:18,295
I think it's good.

250
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:19,465
What is?

251
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,043
You haven't heard anything.

252
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:31,743
Today, Professor Ichikawa will go
on patrol with Professor Ippongi.

253
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:34,586
Nice to meet you!

254
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:37,985
Everyone, count on me.

255
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:39,684
Hello.

256
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:54,835
What are you guys doing here?
It's late. Go home, go home!

257
00:25:56,978 --> 00:25:59,180
Are you sure that's okay?

258
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,776
What do you mean?
It is for their own good.

259
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,279
Professor, are you hungry?

260
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:11,857
Have some, have some.

261
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:17,721
The thing I hate the most is perverts.

262
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,564
At least yakuza punks
live by a code of honour.

263
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:27,242
But perverts, I can never forgive them.

264
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:28,471
Now, I'll eat.

265
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:32,238
It's really good.

266
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,350
It is good.

267
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,684
Ah yes, well you see...

268
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,648
I'm an expert on this kind of food.

269
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:48,795
But my real passion is to be...

270
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:52,895
An English teacher at a girl's school.

271
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:55,869
But I'm so embarrassed!

272
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:59,539
So what's the problem?

273
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,939
The problem is the Sailor Suit.

274
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:05,876
Why is that a problem?

275
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:08,313
It's difficult to walk.

276
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:12,281
That's it?

277
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:29,569
Oh look! It's 9 o'clock.
We'd better get going.

278
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:49,489
It's still bad.

279
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:52,551
But I want to show Asano.

280
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:58,633
Asano, Asano, Asano...

281
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,802
Nakayama-cho 2-chome 553

282
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,104
Nice neighbourhood.

283
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:13,114
What? That's not it.

284
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:22,089
Not Asano's address. Sakura-machi 30.

285
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,025
What?

286
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:31,095
Andoh.

287
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:35,435
Andoh?

288
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:41,303
Andoh.

289
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:48,244
Sakura-machi 3-chome 15. Asano.

290
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:55,551
There's no doubt.

291
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:26,513
Can't be seen like this.

292
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:33,823
You're fired. You're
fired. You're fired...

293
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,194
I'm a fan.

294
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,684
What are you?

295
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:50,664
Zebraman.

296
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:56,576
I'm Zebraman.

297
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:02,581
I'm Zebraman.

298
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:04,376
Die!

299
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:36,607
That hurt.

300
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,482
Be careful.

301
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:42,755
Be careful.

302
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:02,134
What?

303
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:32,132
What the hell?

304
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:46,786
Hey, Hey! A wave reaction.

305
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:49,056
Let's go.

306
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:50,046
What?

307
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:52,924
Hurry up!

308
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:55,754
Zebra Screw Punch.

309
00:33:04,972 --> 00:33:06,304
It's Zebraman...

310
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,569
Hey, what's going on?

311
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,173
Ah, nothing.

312
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,711
Nothing, huh?

313
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:17,148
It's late.

314
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:19,009
You're alone?

315
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:22,122
Is your mum nearby?

316
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,948
Seigawa. Seigawa!

317
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:25,491
Yes!

318
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:48,772
There was another murder.

319
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:53,549
It seems connected to the others.

320
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:57,487
Of course,
we want everyone to be on guard.

321
00:33:58,259 --> 00:33:59,056
That's it.

322
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:10,366
The victim last night seemed
to be covered in green goo.

323
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:18,878
I heard it from my friends,
even though the police deny it.

324
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:24,977
And there's nothing about it on TV.

325
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:52,772
Hey! What are you doing?

326
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:28,366
Zebraman Punch!

327
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,051
Take this.

328
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:38,085
I'm good.

329
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:39,212
This way?

330
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:48,391
Take a look at the body.

331
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:58,701
Ready? It's a bit hard to look at.

332
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:10,618
How could that have happened?

333
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:17,024
Look at the wound...

334
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,592
Oikawa-san?

335
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:19,082
Hmm?

336
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:20,123
Nothing.

337
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:21,762
I'm done.

338
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:22,320
I don't get it.

339
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:23,495
I'm done.

340
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:26,231
Burn it.

341
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,795
Ready!

342
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,168
Light up!

343
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:37,610
Fire!

344
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:54,991
The cases seem to be around
the general area of this school.

345
00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:59,533
Can I speak freely about the cases?

346
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:04,494
Yes, of course. You can ask me anything.

347
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:09,099
What's weird about these cases is that

348
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:13,837
They haven't been reported
on TV or in the newspapers.

349
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:18,178
Hey, what are you implying?

350
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:23,016
Last night, a lot of people
were unaware of the danger.

351
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:26,920
Do you intend to let more people die?

352
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:28,826
Professor Kyoto...

353
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:32,400
Are you afraid of something?

354
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:39,630
Well, there might be a panic...

355
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:42,802
Our first concern is for our students.

356
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:48,907
Our concern is to solve the cases.

357
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:53,753
Professor, these two cases are...

358
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:55,581
I won't answer you!

359
00:38:56,757 --> 00:38:58,623
You make me sick!

360
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,890
I wonder if it was the real Zebraman?

361
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,928
Asano-san...

362
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:30,564
I hope that I can meet him again.

363
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:32,968
I see.

364
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:35,499
I see.

365
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:45,582
You can watch Zebraman on here.

366
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,216
Really?

367
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:52,759
It's the first episode of Zebraman.

368
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:58,527
I remember, I remember. It's Zebraman!

369
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:03,593
Ah! There! There! The Screw Punch, right?

370
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,340
I'm home.

371
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,975
Welcome home.

372
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,013
Ah, professor...

373
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,641
Ah, excuse me.

374
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:16,777
He was teaching me.

375
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,487
Professor Ichikawa is a fan of Zebraman!

376
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:27,086
It makes me feel very nostalgic.

377
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:29,590
Now I'll make dinner.

378
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,320
Yes.

379
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:35,301
Ah, no, no. I should go.

380
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:51,713
Please.

381
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:53,085
Thanks.

382
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,125
What is it?

383
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,157
Professor, you should eat your vegetables.

384
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:08,096
Oh, really?

385
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:12,736
Well, the truth is...

386
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:42,530
Need help?

387
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:44,737
I got it.

388
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,732
I see.

389
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,135
Your family?

390
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:57,674
Oh, that's right. I forgot. I should go.

391
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:02,116
That's not what I meant.

392
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,658
A wife and two kids.

393
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:10,525
I see.

394
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:13,593
What about you?

395
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,136
His father committed suicide.

396
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:28,976
I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you.

397
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:51,834
He was a junior at
the university hospital.

398
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,306
My son saw the whole thing.

399
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:06,817
He jumped from the building.

400
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,288
Yes.

401
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:18,098
I really should go home.

402
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:37,111
Zebra Nurse!!

403
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:53,523
Please.

404
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:58,254
Don't worry, Zebraman.

405
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,134
Zebraman.

406
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,070
Dream?

407
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:23,106
Damn.

408
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,985
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

409
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:46,196
Zebra Bomber!

410
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:26,206
White and Black Man!

411
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:27,139
No!

412
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:30,443
Horse Man!

413
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:31,536
No!

414
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,317
Zebra Double Kick!

415
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:54,595
Ah, sorry, sorry.

416
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:57,161
Where were we...

417
00:48:57,804 --> 00:49:02,475
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

418
00:49:02,475 --> 00:49:03,272
Teacher...

419
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,337
The time is up.

420
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:13,578
Sorry, sorry. Let's go.

421
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,687
A striped man?

422
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:30,032
Well, if there is such a man running
around like that, then he must be an idiot.

423
00:49:30,403 --> 00:49:32,235
Zebraman isn't an idiot!

424
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:34,998
What-man?

425
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:38,343
Asano-kun...

426
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,609
Did you see him?

427
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:53,685
No, I didn't.

428
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:57,193
But, Zebraman isn't an idiot.

429
00:49:57,631 --> 00:49:59,156
He's a savoir.

430
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,704
Hey...

431
00:50:04,704 --> 00:50:06,673
I'll be there soon.

432
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,209
What did Asano tell you?

433
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:12,777
That kid...

434
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:17,511
What are you doing?

435
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:21,418
That kid...

436
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:24,552
What he said...

437
00:50:24,824 --> 00:50:26,986
Cut the crap!

438
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:33,397
I have to solve these cases! I don't
have time to waste with this crap!

439
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:48,782
I'm trying to analyse its programme.

440
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:50,478
Yes.

441
00:50:51,518 --> 00:50:53,487
Mr. Kanda.

442
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,087
I think it's impossible
to find out any more.

443
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,893
But headquarters is waiting for results.

444
00:51:01,695 --> 00:51:03,561
Having to examine in secret slows me down.

445
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,758
What we need to find out...

446
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:09,802
Is how this is spread
from person to person.

447
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,799
It can spread from Yokohama
to cover the whole country.

448
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:18,106
Please don't rush me, Oikawa-san.

449
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,313
Enough of this crap!

450
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:27,453
Whose idea was this anyway?!

451
00:51:34,561 --> 00:51:42,333
We're not getting anywhere. It's
beyond human comprehension.

452
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,125
What do you mean transfer?

453
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,099
To another school?

454
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:19,339
We had no choice. The kids are in danger.

455
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:21,374
Danger?

456
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:21,932
Yes.

457
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:24,375
Shinpei Asano is in danger.

458
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:27,112
I don't understand what you mean?

459
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:29,983
If the students are in danger...

460
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:31,212
You don't have to know.

461
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:36,785
Don't worry. As of tomorrow,
they'll be safe.

462
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:41,561
Professor Kyoto...

463
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,554
The families all agree.

464
00:52:45,865 --> 00:52:47,527
What is it you know?

465
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:50,163
What do you mean?

466
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:57,533
You know something about the case.

467
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:01,108
I'm asking you to stop.

468
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:04,948
It's not just the cases that
put the students in danger.

469
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:07,683
What is it?

470
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,893
What do you know?

471
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:32,979
Excuse me. I'll go fix it.

472
00:53:32,979 --> 00:53:34,480
I'm not done talking with you.

473
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,415
But, my hair...

474
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,577
Who cares about your hair?

475
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,017
I have to go to the toilet.

476
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:41,682
Professor...

477
00:53:42,655 --> 00:53:44,123
Why do you need your bag?

478
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:46,853
Is there something in there?

479
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:50,563
Let me see what's inside!

480
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:51,587
W-what?

481
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:55,067
What could be so important?

482
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,539
Hey, wait!

483
00:54:05,879 --> 00:54:06,903
We're not finished!

484
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,598
Eh, uh, eh, uh...

485
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:21,623
Great food and great
prices. Have some now.

486
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:42,075
What would you like, kids?

487
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:43,747
Where are your mothers?

488
00:55:45,585 --> 00:55:47,110
What are you doing?

489
00:55:51,657 --> 00:55:53,993
Why'd you do that?

490
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:56,829
Don't eat all that!

491
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:58,695
Wait! Wait!

492
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,130
Do you guys have money?

493
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,007
Stop it, you brats!

494
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:26,517
Stop it you brats!

495
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:45,011
Hurry, hurry! Help me! Shoot them!

496
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:46,980
I can't shoot children!

497
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:48,239
What's up?

498
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:51,178
Chief, there's big trouble.

499
00:56:52,585 --> 00:56:54,850
Come on, stop it.

500
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:31,747
Kazuki?

501
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,255
Wait!

502
00:57:58,451 --> 00:57:59,646
Okay, stop.

503
00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:40,549
Hey, Kazuki. It's dad. It's your dad!

504
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:10,208
Stay away!

505
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:13,682
Stay away!

506
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:43,040
Professor!

507
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,884
My son is sick. Where should I take him?

508
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:50,615
Now is bad.

509
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,314
Why?

510
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,425
Someone gave birth to a green baby.

511
01:01:09,675 --> 01:01:11,109
You really helped me.

512
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,940
Thank you.

513
01:01:19,018 --> 01:01:20,247
Asano-kun?

514
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,345
He's sleeping in his room.

515
01:01:24,824 --> 01:01:25,951
I see.

516
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:38,463
Professor?

517
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:42,908
Can I ask you something?

518
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:45,972
Sure.

519
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:00,792
Are you really...

520
01:02:05,397 --> 01:02:06,592
Zebraman?

521
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,470
It's true.

522
01:02:26,585 --> 01:02:31,785
You were in one of my dreams.

523
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:41,901
You healed a big wound.

524
01:02:45,604 --> 01:02:49,166
I wanted to help you.

525
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:55,481
It seemed so real.

526
01:02:57,116 --> 01:02:58,015
Professor...

527
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:01,215
Today...

528
01:03:03,789 --> 01:03:05,519
I understood it.

529
01:03:10,095 --> 01:03:12,257
The reason why I fight...

530
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,624
Is for dreams.

531
01:03:25,878 --> 01:03:30,907
Not for my dreams, but for...

532
01:03:33,152 --> 01:03:34,381
but for his.

533
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:37,651
That's what I believe.

534
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:56,938
Kazuki? Are you all right?

535
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:58,805
Are you okay?

536
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:04,544
He's okay.

537
01:04:58,237 --> 01:05:03,869
I'm sorry for before.

538
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,000
"There's no more time"

539
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:09,506
"I leave the rest up to you"

540
01:06:13,545 --> 01:06:15,411
"Anything Goes"

541
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:21,085
Anything goes?

542
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,078
Hey, what are you doing?

543
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:58,785
Hey, what are you doing?

544
01:07:00,492 --> 01:07:02,188
I'm looking for Professor Kyoto.

545
01:07:02,828 --> 01:07:03,659
Here?

546
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:05,419
Yeah, here.

547
01:07:06,098 --> 01:07:07,122
I'm there.

548
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:09,229
There?

549
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,862
That's close.

550
01:07:13,972 --> 01:07:17,465
During the incident that just passed,

551
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:23,349
There was a striped man
who helped save the kids.

552
01:07:26,218 --> 01:07:30,087
I'm trying to find out who he is.

553
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,699
Excuse me.

554
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:50,305
What is this?

555
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:53,274
It's a dump, right?

556
01:07:54,546 --> 01:07:56,310
A real dump.

557
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:01,480
Is Kyoto okay?

558
01:08:10,896 --> 01:08:11,795
Excuse me.

559
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:39,280
Scripts?

560
01:08:54,072 --> 01:08:55,836
"Car stealing kids"

561
01:08:56,074 --> 01:08:57,337
"Crab Man"

562
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,744
"Green Baby"

563
01:09:13,058 --> 01:09:15,027
Zebraman scripts.

564
01:09:16,762 --> 01:09:22,394
What I'm about to tell you is surprising.

565
01:09:24,136 --> 01:09:31,134
These scripts contain everything
that's been going on lately.

566
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:34,007
Crab Man.

567
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,842
Kids stealing cars.

568
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,978
Green baby.

569
01:09:41,186 --> 01:09:44,953
Wait a second. I heard
nothing about those.

570
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:55,266
But, Professor Kyoto
knew about it all this time.

571
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,509
It's all here.

572
01:10:06,378 --> 01:10:07,710
Professor Kyoto?

573
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:10,645
Yes.

574
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:15,484
He must know about Zebraman.

575
01:10:16,655 --> 01:10:23,459
Hey, did you ever hear anything
strange from the professor's room?

576
01:10:24,129 --> 01:10:26,965
No, I never did.

577
01:10:26,965 --> 01:10:32,199
Too bad. I think Kyoto
knows what's going on.

578
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:35,741
I think Kyoto is in alien hands.

579
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:37,009
Who told you that?

580
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:38,238
Wait a sec!

581
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:44,741
Read this.

582
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:46,543
Yes.

583
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:59,164
In Yokohama, 34 years ago,
a UFO crash-landed.

584
01:11:06,605 --> 01:11:14,274
The aliens mixed in with humans around
the area of the junior high school.

585
01:11:17,582 --> 01:11:25,513
Soon after, the alien's began using
the Zebraman scripts for their plans.

586
01:11:27,459 --> 01:11:31,123
The program was cancelled early.

587
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:43,164
The UFO aliens used the junior
high school to further their plans.

588
01:11:48,947 --> 01:11:54,477
They began to further
experiment on humans.

589
01:11:57,489 --> 01:12:01,256
Professor Kyoto began a one
man fight against the aliens.

590
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:08,960
That's why he wanted to transfer
the students to another school.

591
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:15,173
He said...

592
01:12:16,808 --> 01:12:18,037
What?

593
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:20,539
Anything goes.

594
01:12:25,851 --> 01:12:26,750
He believed...

595
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,014
Dreams come true.

596
01:12:53,545 --> 01:13:03,544
Kyoto is an alien. But not just a normal
alien. He's an original alien from the UFO.

597
01:13:08,727 --> 01:13:09,319
Hey.

598
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:10,688
Yes?

599
01:13:14,733 --> 01:13:22,834
We can't let you interfere
with our plans for invasion...

600
01:13:58,777 --> 01:13:59,676
Seigawa...

601
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:08,981
Seigawa-san is dead.

602
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:55,363
I need a bike.

603
01:15:02,204 --> 01:15:03,832
I should have a bike.

604
01:15:10,612 --> 01:15:14,982
Heroes always have bikes.

605
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:30,028
Sorry.

606
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:15,708
Kazuki...

607
01:16:21,483 --> 01:16:22,849
Your father...

608
01:16:25,821 --> 01:16:27,585
Needs to fly to the sky...

609
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:48,433
Sorry.

610
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:56,116
Your mother...

611
01:16:58,687 --> 01:16:59,586
And sister...

612
01:17:03,559 --> 01:17:04,788
Take care of them.

613
01:17:15,103 --> 01:17:16,162
Dad...

614
01:17:31,653 --> 01:17:32,780
Do your best.

615
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:13,947
Did you read the script
for the final episode?

616
01:19:15,157 --> 01:19:15,852
No.

617
01:19:17,893 --> 01:19:19,327
How about Asano-kun?

618
01:19:21,263 --> 01:19:23,823
He didn't read it either.

619
01:19:27,135 --> 01:19:28,694
That's good.

620
01:19:39,147 --> 01:19:42,174
I don't think I can fly.

621
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:51,221
When fighting the alien boss,

622
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,763
Zebraman

623
01:19:58,834 --> 01:20:00,166
Gets defeated.

624
01:20:03,305 --> 01:20:04,933
But then...

625
01:20:08,443 --> 01:20:09,968
What happens?

626
01:20:13,815 --> 01:20:15,010
Zebraman...

627
01:20:18,654 --> 01:20:20,486
Flies into the sky.

628
01:20:26,228 --> 01:20:27,025
Then he...

629
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:32,060
saves the earth and humanity...

630
01:20:35,504 --> 01:20:36,733
From the alien invasion.

631
01:20:43,512 --> 01:20:45,242
That's the final episode.

632
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,419
What the heck is that?

633
01:20:52,454 --> 01:20:56,516
Who would watch such a show?

634
01:20:59,061 --> 01:21:00,927
You've been practising flying?

635
01:21:03,432 --> 01:21:03,922
Yes.

636
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,797
How long?

637
01:21:07,836 --> 01:21:08,667
10 days.

638
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,949
I think to fly...

639
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,084
is impossible.

640
01:21:35,864 --> 01:21:38,459
I wish I never read that script!

641
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:51,642
My son believes in you.

642
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:58,686
He believes that Zebraman
will protect the earth.

643
01:22:02,657 --> 01:22:04,285
For my son's sake...

644
01:22:07,796 --> 01:22:08,388
please...

645
01:22:11,066 --> 01:22:12,796
learn how to fly!

646
01:22:30,352 --> 01:22:31,251
Miss...

647
01:22:32,888 --> 01:22:33,981
Yes.

648
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:39,019
Did you...

649
01:22:41,196 --> 01:22:42,494
understand my story?

650
01:22:46,334 --> 01:22:47,233
Yes.

651
01:22:57,012 --> 01:22:59,914
There is one man who can help.

652
01:23:01,316 --> 01:23:02,147
Who is it?

653
01:23:03,885 --> 01:23:05,114
It's Zebraman.

654
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:08,979
It's Zebraman!

655
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:13,387
You mean that striped guy?

656
01:23:14,696 --> 01:23:18,326
Sounds weird, doesn't it?

657
01:23:19,234 --> 01:23:27,335
But I think he's the only
one who can help us.

658
01:23:27,776 --> 01:23:29,108
No need.

659
01:23:31,146 --> 01:23:35,743
The order has been given.

660
01:23:37,886 --> 01:23:42,347
Tonight,
the Junior High School will be no more.

661
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:46,786
Our operation will be over.

662
01:23:47,562 --> 01:23:54,469
In a moment,
the school will cease to exist.

663
01:23:57,572 --> 01:24:02,010
I expect your support.

664
01:24:13,822 --> 01:24:15,791
How can you say that?

665
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:18,086
Everyone has gone crazy.

666
01:24:19,694 --> 01:24:23,563
It's all we can do to survive.

667
01:24:44,686 --> 01:24:46,018
Dad...

668
01:24:49,824 --> 01:24:50,951
Do your best.

669
01:24:53,929 --> 01:24:55,454
He believes.

670
01:24:57,732 --> 01:24:59,564
Believes in dreams.

671
01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:10,608
Believe in dreams, believe in dreams.

672
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:07,836
Why did you come here? If
something bad happened tell me...

673
01:26:07,836 --> 01:26:10,772
No,
no. I had something important to tell you.

674
01:26:14,476 --> 01:26:16,104
You should not give up.

675
01:26:19,948 --> 01:26:29,947
I really believe that you are a
big hero, defending the earth.

676
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:41,068
You look terrible.

677
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:48,135
Well, I'm sorry for suddenly
saying such weird things.

678
01:26:49,744 --> 01:26:50,871
Later.

679
01:26:51,946 --> 01:26:53,710
Take care.

680
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:09,480
Shinpei?

681
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:12,858
Where are you, Shinpei?

682
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,862
Toilet?

683
01:28:20,268 --> 01:28:21,497
Shinpei!

684
01:28:55,103 --> 01:28:56,901
Please stop, please stop.

685
01:28:57,872 --> 01:28:58,940
What is it?

686
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:01,102
We're sorry, but the road is closed.

687
01:29:01,509 --> 01:29:02,844
Why?

688
01:29:02,844 --> 01:29:04,403
We're sorry, no one can pass.

689
01:29:04,846 --> 01:29:07,543
But my son went to the school...

690
01:29:09,484 --> 01:29:13,546
Everything is in order here.

691
01:29:43,918 --> 01:29:47,548
Please! I need to go to the school!

692
01:30:39,007 --> 01:30:40,635
You're good, Professor.

693
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:45,671
Clear a path.

694
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:48,206
Open it, open it.

695
01:31:08,636 --> 01:31:14,803
Let's go. To the school. Get on.

696
01:31:15,243 --> 01:31:15,835
Yes.

697
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:16,731
Asano-san.

698
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:26,206
Zebraman.

699
01:32:28,883 --> 01:32:30,511
Help me, Zebraman!

700
01:33:13,561 --> 01:33:15,325
Do your best, Zebraman!

701
01:35:51,285 --> 01:35:51,980
Great!

702
01:36:29,957 --> 01:36:31,585
Zebraman, look out!

703
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:37,154
You're not gonna...

704
01:36:37,865 --> 01:36:38,958
keep me down.

705
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:16,296
Hey? What's going on?

706
01:37:16,537 --> 01:37:17,266
Kazuki!

707
01:37:17,404 --> 01:37:18,201
What?

708
01:37:58,145 --> 01:38:00,842
Now what?

709
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:08,011
There's only 3 minutes left until the
chopper gets here! Let's clear out!

710
01:38:10,691 --> 01:38:11,659
Shinpei!

711
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:12,854
Shinpei?

712
01:38:55,903 --> 01:38:56,700
Shinpei!

713
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,016
What now?

714
01:39:44,685 --> 01:39:45,584
Fly.

715
01:39:47,922 --> 01:39:50,414
Zebraman, fly and fight.

716
01:39:53,928 --> 01:39:54,827
Asano-san.

717
01:39:55,596 --> 01:39:57,656
Zebraman has to fly.

718
01:39:58,032 --> 01:39:59,864
Zebraman has to fly to the sky.

719
01:40:03,203 --> 01:40:06,970
You have to believe that you can fly.

720
01:41:00,461 --> 01:41:01,622
Asano-san...

721
01:41:05,332 --> 01:41:06,265
See.

722
01:41:10,104 --> 01:41:12,266
Now it's Zebraman's turn.

723
01:41:38,932 --> 01:41:40,366
Zebraman!

724
01:41:42,436 --> 01:41:43,563
Fly!

725
01:41:59,053 --> 01:41:59,741
Shinpei!

726
01:41:59,742 --> 01:42:01,253
Fly!

727
01:42:26,046 --> 01:42:26,877
He flew.

728
01:42:41,628 --> 01:42:42,755
Shinpei!

729
01:42:50,704 --> 01:42:51,933
Thank you...

730
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,165
Zebraman.

731
01:46:36,163 --> 01:46:37,529
Hey...

732
01:46:38,265 --> 01:46:40,029
Can I ask you something?

733
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:42,167
What?

734
01:46:43,236 --> 01:46:45,432
My mask...

735
01:46:46,707 --> 01:46:50,269
I was finally having some fun.

736
01:46:51,026 --> 01:46:56,658
Yes, yes. Everything is fine now.

737
01:46:58,467 --> 01:47:00,959
Japan is safe!

738
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:09,408
We're here.

739
01:47:23,792 --> 01:47:25,556
Here.

740
01:47:28,964 --> 01:47:36,167
Everyone is waiting for Zebraman.

741
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:37,966
He looks like a fine man.

742
01:48:37,966 --> 01:48:39,935
He doesn't look like dad?

743
01:48:40,068 --> 01:48:42,128
No way! Don't say such a thing!

744
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:23,974
Thank you, Zebraman!

745
01:50:11,727 --> 01:50:12,956
Turn on the black and white.
