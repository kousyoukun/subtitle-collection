2
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,990
Come on.

3
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:58,521
Come on!

4
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:10,509
Don't let him get away!

5
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:58,788
Get inside now!

6
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,698
Hurry up! You're late!

7
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:05,605
Proxima's gonna
have your hide.

8
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,448
Get back in the den.

9
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:11,930
Look what I stole!

10
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,981
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!

11
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:15,953
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

12
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:16,807
Hey, give it back!

13
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:17,997
It belongs to
whoever's holding it!

14
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:18,907
And that's not you!

15
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,143
Lex!

16
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,529
Full Sabacc!

17
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,874
Idiot's Array.

18
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:23,939
What? Let me see that!

19
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,043
Nope, it's my card.

20
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,095
You cheat.

21
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:27,995
Han!

22
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,508
You were gone too long!

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,017
I knew something
must've gone wrong.

24
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,624
This is nothing.
You should see them.

25
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:37,699
Look down here!

26
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,135
All right, listen.

27
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:41,520
I was in the middle
of the exchange,

28
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:42,666
I'm handing over
the coaxium

29
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,510
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed 'em.

30
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,146
How?

31
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:47,322
I ran away, then I
boosted their speeder.

32
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:48,398
What, are we
going somewhere?

33
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:50,191
Yeah, anywhere we want.

34
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,698
You held on to
one of the vials?

35
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,880
Han's back!

36
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,705
This,
this is worth...

37
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,696
Five, six hundred credits.

38
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,900
That's more than
you said we'd need.

39
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,140
To buy our way out
of the control zone.

40
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,572
And off Corellia.

41
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:08,680
Han, this could work.

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,806
This is gonna work.

43
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:12,376
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

44
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:13,712
This is it.

45
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,533
What are we waiting for?

46
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,096
There he is.
Hey, you two!

47
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:29,012
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?

48
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,300
I was just on my way
to see Lady Proxima.

49
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,382
What a night I had.

50
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,611
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

51
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,752
Hold still, scrumrat!

52
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:44,356
Easy.

53
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,517
Come on.

54
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:47,645
All right.

55
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:49,900
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

56
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:13,495
Well, what happened?

57
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,832
I'll tell you what happened.

58
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:17,042
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.

59
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:17,880
The money?

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,692
- They kept it.
- And my coaxium?

61
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:21,780
They kept that, too.

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,784
But we learned
a very valuable lesson.

63
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:26,425
We cannot trust those guys.

64
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,291
So you expect me to believe

65
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:30,927
that you walked away
with nothing!

66
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,217
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

67
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,416
To me, that's a lot.

68
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,723
I trusted you
with a simple task,

69
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,499
and all I'm hearing
are excuses.

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,829
There must be consequences
for disobedience

71
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,694
or else you never learn.

72
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,879
You know what?

73
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,211
I don't think
I'm ever gonna learn.

74
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,886
What did you say?

75
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:08,309
I said, next time
somebody hits me,

76
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,760
I hit 'em back.

77
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:14,853
Moloch, wait!

78
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:16,219
Don't!

79
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,739
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

80
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,614
We pulled you
out of that horror,

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,156
gave you a home.

82
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,872
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!

83
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:29,365
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

84
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:30,692
We will make it up to you.

85
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,243
Everybody, stand back!

86
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,026
What's that supposed to be?

87
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,710
This is a thermal detonator

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,245
that I just armed.

89
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,947
- That's a rock!
- No, it's not.

90
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:46,810
Yes, it is!

91
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,711
And you just made

92
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:49,475
a clicking sound
with your mouth.

93
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,239
Please tell me
this isn't your plan.

94
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,618
No, this is.

95
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:04,382
- Get in!
- An M-68?

96
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,224
- Nice, right?
- I love it!

97
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,477
Whoa!

98
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:42,043
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

99
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,318
we're gonna be on it.

100
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,999
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.

101
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:50,048
I'm gonna be a pilot.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,516
We can get our own ship.

103
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:53,434
See the galaxy,
all of it.

104
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:58,252
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

105
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,673
Ever.

106
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,223
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.

107
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,370
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

108
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,702
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

109
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,828
<i>You must have
proper clearance.</i>

110
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,610
<i>Stop at once! You must
follow the proper...</i>

111
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,757
<i>Protocol.</i>

112
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,438
Damn!
That stinger's fast.

113
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:48,908
Yeah, but we're faster,
right?

114
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,388
I hope so.

115
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:21,881
<i>Pull over!</i>

116
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,371
Han, no,
we're not gonna make it!

117
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,128
Oh, yeah?

118
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:47,897
Han, I'm telling you,
it's too tight!

119
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:49,402
Watch this.

120
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,447
Come on!

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,668
We gotta move.

122
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>Do not join the line</i>

123
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:32,408
<i>if you don't have
a boarding pass.</i>

124
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:36,009
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

125
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:39,259
<i>All droids
must be registered.</i>

126
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,379
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

127
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:46,923
<i>Stand down. Do not resist!</i>

128
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,649
- <i>Stop struggling.</i>
- Let me go!

129
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:50,618
<i>Take his arm.</i>

130
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:51,386
<i>I got him.</i>

131
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,557
<i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

132
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:54,918
<i>This way, come on.</i>

133
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,407
<i>Keep moving.
Hold it, hold it.</i>

134
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:00,885
Next.

135
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,869
Han, they're here.

136
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:10,545
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

137
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:13,612
We're almost there.

138
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,617
- Just hold on to me.
- Next.

139
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,691
Don't look back.

140
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,241
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,

141
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,751
figure out
where we're going.

142
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,766
Anywhere the Empire isn't.
Wherever we go,

143
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:25,325
it can't be worse
than where we've been.

144
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:28,813
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

145
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,983
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,

146
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:33,552
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.

147
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,710
That's not gonna happen.

148
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:36,961
I won't let it.

149
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:45,671
For luck?

150
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:48,004
Damn right.

151
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,126
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

152
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,340
Next.

153
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,682
ID chips.

154
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:00,818
Funny thing,
we don't have 'em.

155
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:02,180
We have this.

156
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,703
Refined hyperfuel.

157
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,665
It's worth at least
800 credits, maybe more.

158
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,335
You could be detained
just for having that.

159
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,167
What good would
that do anybody?

160
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:14,238
Let us through,
it's all yours.

161
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,849
The coaxium, now.

162
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,471
As we're going through,
not before.

163
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:34,004
Do it.

164
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,181
Just do it, do it.

165
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:43,743
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!

166
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:45,404
Wait!
Open the door!

167
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,975
Security! Security,
there has been a breach!

168
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,411
Open the door!

169
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,947
- Run! Run!
- Get your hands off of her!

170
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,222
Run!

171
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,053
Get your hands off of her!

172
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:56,886
Qi'ra!

173
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,257
Run, Han! Go!

174
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,691
Keep moving.

175
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:04,061
Qi'ra!

176
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:05,030
Run!

177
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,472
<i>Traveler
has been apprehended.</i>

178
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,774
Qi'ra, I'll come back!
I'll come back!

179
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:14,372
<i>All units,
there has been a breach.</i>

180
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:18,314
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>

181
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:19,828
One got through
the gate! Look over there!

182
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,983
<i>Someone
got through the checkpoint.</i>

183
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,018
- Keep an eye on that gate.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,447
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

185
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:35,006
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

186
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,523
Hey, wait!

187
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,154
- Hey!
<i>- Come with us.</i>

188
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:43,685
<i>He's still
out there. Keep looking.</i>

189
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,108
<i>You there, stop!</i>

190
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,761
- <i>Show me some identification.</i>
- Please. Please. No, no!

191
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,992
<i>Do not resist.</i>

192
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:04,414
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

193
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:08,973
<i>Explore new worlds.
Learn valuable skills.</i>

194
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,803
<i>Bring order and unity
to the galaxy!</i>

195
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,177
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

196
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,404
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?

197
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,988
If you apply
for the Imperial Navy,

198
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:22,823
but most recruits
go into the infantry.

199
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:25,979
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Best in the galaxy.

200
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,782
You there,
come with us.

201
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:28,885
Who, me?

202
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,771
We have a few questions
to ask you.

203
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:32,560
How long
is that gonna take?

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,039
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

205
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,475
Why, have you got
somewhere to be?

206
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,673
Yeah, back here,
as soon as I can.

207
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:43,127
Don't hear that much.
What's your name, son?

208
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,210
Han.

209
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:45,961
Han what?

210
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,924
Who are your people?

211
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,477
I don't have people.
I'm alone.

212
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,680
Han...

213
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:01,814
Solo.

214
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:04,869
Approved.

215
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,701
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

216
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,220
Good luck, Han Solo.

217
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:12,840
We'll have you flying
in no time.

218
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:29,927
Your Empire needs you.
Troopers forward!

219
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,026
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!

220
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:34,547
Almost where?
Where are we going?

221
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:37,499
Just over that last ridge.
Victory is...

222
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:51,047
My legs! My leg!

223
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,453
<i>Hey, Beckett,
you said we were here</i>

224
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:09,809
<i>to pull a quick job.</i>

225
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:11,787
- Yeah.
- <i>Well, this ain't a quick job!</i>

226
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,234
<i>It's a war!</i>

227
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:15,790
It's always
something with you.

228
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,340
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.

229
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,758
Forward operations
must be this way.

230
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,427
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

231
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,442
Yeah, go that way and die!

232
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:30,045
That's exactly what happened
to the major!

233
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:32,387
Who's the ranking
officer now?

234
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,117
You are, Captain.

235
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,567
<i>He's got you there.</i>

236
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,941
So what's the plan,
Captain Beckett?

237
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,292
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

238
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:46,883
I'll take this
mouthy scooch

239
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,167
and we'll go around
to the right

240
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:50,370
and maybe
we'll get lucky.

241
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:52,087
<i>Luck's got
nothin' to do with it.</i>

242
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:55,118
Wait! One question!

243
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,400
- You wanna live, sparky?
- Very much.

244
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,928
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

245
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,217
Let's go!

246
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:17,258
Captain.

247
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:19,610
<i>T-15s are down.
We walk from here.</i>

248
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:20,770
Captain.

249
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:24,051
I'm Han.

250
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:26,743
Nobody cares.

251
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,287
Thanks for your help
back there.

252
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:31,585
You did all right.

253
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:34,223
I was trained
in aerial combat...

254
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,172
You want some advice?

255
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,440
Get the hell
away from here.

256
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,016
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.

257
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:44,334
What company
do you command?

258
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:46,110
None of your business
company.

259
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,017
And we're full up.

260
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:50,409
<i>Stick
to soldiering, kid.</i>

261
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:51,891
<i>You don't want
any part of this.</i>

262
00:16:58,496 --> 00:16:59,732
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

263
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,300
Attention!

264
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:06,603
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

265
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,261
I want an advance party
of ten men.

266
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,143
Great, more mud.

267
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:13,343
What was that?

268
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:16,193
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

269
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:19,054
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,

270
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,047
install a regime
loyal to the Emperor,

271
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,093
and eradicate
the hostiles.

272
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,389
It's their planet,
we're the hostiles.

273
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,641
You got a problem, trooper?

274
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,198
No problem, sir.

275
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,177
Moving out.

276
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:37,075
To the southern
marshlands! Move out!

277
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,135
You heard 'em!
Let's move out!

278
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,386
Mmm. Looks like
they're running sorties

279
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,998
every 30 minutes.

280
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:53,508
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,

281
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:54,863
signalman, pilot.

282
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,352
Hell, I'll just
take 'em all out.

283
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,781
What are we
looking at?

284
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:03,360
You have a talent for
sticking your nose in

285
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,808
where it doesn't belong.

286
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,410
I just couldn't help
but notice

287
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,721
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

288
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:11,272
So either
you heal real quick

289
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,460
or you stole it off
a dead man.

290
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,635
You're not Imperial Army.

291
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:17,158
You're thieves here
to steal equipment

292
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:19,011
for a job and I want in.

293
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,439
- Well, now we gotta shoot him.
- No.

294
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:24,540
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.

295
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:25,955
Or you take me with you.

296
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,708
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

297
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,213
I was boosting AV-21s
when I was ten.

298
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,093
I'm a driver, a flyer,

299
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:36,583
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

300
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:39,154
<i>What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?</i>

301
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:42,420
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy

302
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,014
for having
a mind of my own.

303
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:47,533
But I am a great pilot.
And I gotta get home.

304
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,173
<i>This guy is nuts. No
one goes back to Corellia.</i>

305
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,669
I got a reason.

306
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,835
We've already
got a great pilot.

307
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,464
The Ardennian.

308
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:58,637
<i>Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>

309
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,101
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

310
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:01,360
Oh, really?
A couple of your arms

311
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:02,196
popped out of your butt

312
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:03,967
and hiked up your pants,
trooper.

313
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:04,766
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

314
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:07,210
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

315
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,486
I've already been away
too long.

316
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,429
Just give me a shot.

317
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,174
<i>Whoa. Hold it.</i>

318
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,661
Well, if you're
not interested in me,

319
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:18,697
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

320
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,773
Blackmail.

321
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,178
Lieutenant.

322
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:28,218
Captain.

323
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,758
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.

324
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:32,705
Take him.

325
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:33,536
Wait.

326
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:36,546
I should've known.
This one's a troublemaker.

327
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:38,780
And a liar. Don't
believe anything he says.

328
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,948
- Don't go anywhere without me.
<i>- All right, let's go.</i>

329
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,197
Feed him to the beast.

330
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,924
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?

331
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,173
- Hold on!
<i>- Move it!</i>

332
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,428
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

333
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:48,804
- He was lying!
<i>- Quiet!</i>

334
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:51,599
<i>Don't care.</i>

335
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:56,244
<i>Haven't fed
him in three days.</i>

336
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,538
<i>Should be fun.</i>

337
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:46,493
Oh! Hey!
Hey, big fella.

338
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,242
Just calm down.
Take it easy.

339
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:50,836
We're on the same side.

340
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:52,591
You like treats?

341
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,641
Help!
Let me out of here!

342
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:57,850
Let me out of here!

343
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,991
A-ha! Gotcha!

344
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,405
Ahhh!

345
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,691
<i>Ah, this was
just getting good.</i>

346
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:27,079
<i>- He killed him too fast.
- Yeah!</i>

347
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,420
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

348
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:32,661
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

349
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:35,264
Wait! Wait!

350
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,106
Yeah, I speak a little.

351
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:43,065
Now just listen to me, you...

352
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:03,446
Yes, yes!

353
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,356
No, no, no, no!

354
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,191
Do it!

355
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:10,476
Come on.

356
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,847
Oh, no!

357
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,027
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.</i>

358
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,927
Let me out of here!

359
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,724
I can't take it anymore!

360
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,969
- Oh, no! Stop, please!
- <i>That's it. Get him!</i>

361
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:27,726
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?

362
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:41,484
See what happens
when you listen to me?

363
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:43,472
Hey, what are you doing?

364
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:47,516
Ow.

365
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:51,692
Follow me!

366
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:03,997
Wait, wait.

367
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:05,932
Come here.
Listen to me.

368
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:06,930
You don't understand,
okay?

369
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,872
I have some
very good friends

370
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:09,032
waiting for me
at that airfield.

371
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,453
They're leaving
right now.

372
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:12,172
That's our one way
off this mud ball.

373
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:13,848
If you wanna live,
we go that way.

374
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:16,361
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

375
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:18,509
But right now,
that's the way you go!

376
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:22,273
Trust me!

377
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:25,235
Val, let's go!

378
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:31,475
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!

379
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,430
No wonder
they're such lousy pilots.

380
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,162
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,

381
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,576
you can't hear each other!

382
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,021
I'll be damned.

383
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,526
Hey, look who's back!

384
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,839
Unbelievable!

385
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:49,652
Wait!

386
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:51,550
Wait!

387
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,223
Whoa, is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!

388
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,587
I'll say it, I don't care.

389
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,162
This kid's growing on me.

390
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,136
Wait!

391
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:03,789
You know, we could always use

392
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:05,844
some muscle
on a job like this.

393
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,864
Don't even
think about it!

394
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,297
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

395
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:12,063
than curled up
in a Wookiee's lap.

396
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:20,683
I told you!

397
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,811
Very good friends!

398
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,446
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

399
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:20,358
Thanks for helping me
get outta there.

400
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,649
No, they only took you
because of me.

401
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:30,973
Hey!

402
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:33,724
I got us
a real sweet deal here.

403
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:35,778
We do this one job
with them,

404
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:37,683
we make some real money,

405
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:39,886
and then we're free.

406
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:42,036
When's the last time
you could say that?

407
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,744
Been a while
for me, too.

408
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:51,470
So what's your name,
anyway?

409
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,240
Chewbacca?

410
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:59,626
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

411
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:01,439
'cause I ain't saying that
every time.

412
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,703
Here it comes.
Take a look.

413
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:09,385
Yeah.

414
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:13,320
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

415
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:16,562
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

416
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:19,193
cable it up to the AT-hauler
and then...

417
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,087
Rio jams
their distress signal.

418
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,870
I blow the bridge,

419
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,804
the container slides
right off the track

420
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:26,257
and we sail away.

421
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:28,062
You trip that security beam,

422
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,225
wake up those Vipers,

423
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:31,688
it's liable to get
real spicy, real fast.

424
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,910
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

425
00:26:33,988 --> 00:26:35,370
Enfys Nest.

426
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:36,829
What's an Enfys Nest?

427
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,000
I told you,
we're way ahead

428
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,824
of the competition
on this one.

429
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,081
There's no way Enfys Nest

430
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,184
even knows
about this shipment.

431
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:44,947
Only my guy
has the intel.

432
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:47,478
Well, you better
be right. Yeah?

433
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,691
Because sometimes,
you put your faith

434
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:51,115
in the wrong people.

435
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:55,841
<i>Our whole future
depends on this one score</i>

436
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,199
<i>and you bring in amateurs.</i>

437
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:58,497
<i>In case you hadn't noticed,</i>

438
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:00,164
<i>we're a little shorthanded.</i>

439
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:01,689
So we get who we need.

440
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,217
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

441
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:06,548
But, no, instead you're
putting our lives

442
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:08,165
in the hands of morons.

443
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,535
You guys morons?

444
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:11,427
No!

445
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,613
- No. See?
- We're not morons.

446
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:16,628
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

447
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,474
I'm not about to screw it up,
all right?

448
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,434
Oh, come on, Val!

449
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,112
He looks so sincere.

450
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,539
Plus, have you ever
tried to disinvite

451
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:24,659
a Wookiee to anything?

452
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,229
Not a good idea!

453
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,619
This is not funny!

454
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:33,149
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

455
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:37,063
And, besides,
do you see any other options?

456
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:38,467
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

457
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,255
Yeah, I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.

458
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:43,149
We're gonna
clear our debts,

459
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:45,102
go back to Glee Anselm,

460
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,822
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

461
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,050
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

462
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:52,903
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.

463
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,836
So what's your sob story,
flyboy?

464
00:27:58,876 --> 00:27:59,750
Who, me?

465
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,788
You're after something,
I know the look.

466
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:03,483
What is it?
Revenge?

467
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:05,955
No, it's not revenge.

468
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:07,549
Look at him.

469
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:09,237
If it's anything,
it's a girl.

470
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:10,259
Oh, a girl!

471
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,865
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?

472
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,124
Does she have sharp teeth?

473
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:19,606
There was a girl.

474
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:23,246
But I got out,
she didn't.

475
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:27,965
I swore to myself
I'd become a pilot,

476
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,052
get a ship,

477
00:28:30,157 --> 00:28:31,440
go back and find her.

478
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:36,335
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.

479
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:38,442
How you know
she'll still be there?

480
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:40,966
I just know.

481
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:42,400
Personally, I refuse
to be tied down

482
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:44,586
by anyone,
though many have tried.

483
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:47,457
Come on, Rio.
You don't fool me.

484
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,310
Everybody needs somebody.

485
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:53,825
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.

486
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:06,769
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?

487
00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:20,788
What was he saying?

488
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:22,233
He said the Wookiees
were enslaved

489
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,806
by the Empire,
taken off Kashyyyk.

490
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:26,821
He's searching
for his, uh...

491
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,269
I don't know if he said
tribe or family.

492
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:32,918
What's the difference?

493
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:37,543
Show me how to do that.

494
00:29:37,724 --> 00:29:39,953
The only thing
you need to learn to do

495
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:45,276
is do what I say
when I say it.

496
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,363
And this time tomorrow,

497
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:48,637
you'll have
more than enough

498
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:50,080
to buy your own ship.

499
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,334
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

500
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:16,076
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.

501
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:18,519
<i>Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.</i>

502
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,207
I'm fine!

503
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:37,108
Val, how's it going
up there?

504
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,418
Never better.

505
00:31:05,584 --> 00:31:06,987
Coaxium.

506
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,313
Enough to power a fleet!

507
00:31:09,353 --> 00:31:11,859
Or blow us all
straight to hell!

508
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:15,822
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

509
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,272
Is it a good day?

510
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:19,077
<i>It's a great day!</i>

511
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:21,681
Best day of your life,
my grabby friend!

512
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,894
I don't know,
you've never been

513
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,708
to a Mynock roast
on Ardennia.

514
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:25,849
It's nuts!

515
00:31:28,474 --> 00:31:29,668
Here they come!

516
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,458
Get down to the couplers!

517
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:33,059
Rio, fall back!

518
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,436
Well, that didn't
take 'em long.

519
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,750
Chewie!

520
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,820
You all right?

521
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,662
Little close there,
buddy!

522
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,794
Han, what's the holdup?

523
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,914
All right, together.

524
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,735
Now!

525
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,728
All right!

526
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,522
Oh!

527
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,070
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?

528
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:42,976
<i>Just up here
planning my retirement.</i>

529
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:44,264
Thinking about opening
a cantina

530
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,638
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?

531
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:49,048
Lowering
the winch cables now!

532
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,847
I knew it! I told him!
Beckett!

533
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,089
<i>He's coming!</i>

534
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:13,132
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

535
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:19,109
Who's that?

536
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:20,705
Enfys Nest!

537
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,499
Marauders, pirates.

538
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,331
Come to snake the score
from under us.

539
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,094
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

540
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:28,097
<i>Move in.</i>

541
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,006
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.

542
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:14,450
Get off of my ship!

543
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:20,519
You still with us, brother?

544
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:22,477
Yeah, I'm okay.

545
00:34:22,535 --> 00:34:24,538
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.

546
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:26,311
He's not okay.

547
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:34,935
Chewie!

548
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:37,304
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!

549
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:44,079
Han!

550
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:45,396
I'm on it!

551
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:56,102
Val!

552
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:59,094
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>

553
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,143
Viper droids
headed your way!

554
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:09,314
Rio?

555
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,529
Yeah, it looks worse
than it is.

556
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:14,282
Just gotta patch it up.

557
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,692
Maybe rest my eyes
for a minute.

558
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,868
<i>Enough!
I'm going in.</i>

559
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:05,578
You weren't lying, kid.

560
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,615
You're a hell of a pilot.

561
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:10,012
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

562
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,957
Beckett,
we just lost a cable!

563
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,943
<i>2.1 to the bridge!</i>

564
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:33,684
It's no good
to die alone, kid.

565
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,690
Val was right.

566
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:40,455
Rio?

567
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,960
Beckett, we're .8
from the bridge!

568
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,163
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

569
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:17,402
Val, you gotta
get off that bridge!

570
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,404
We're here!

571
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,508
They got me pinned!

572
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,729
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

573
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:28,372
What?

574
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,052
It's been a ride, babe.

575
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,625
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

576
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,351
<i>Val!</i>

577
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,622
No!

578
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:44,504
No!

579
00:37:58,088 --> 00:37:59,964
Chewie, now!

580
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:24,518
<i>Beckett, I can't
pull it away from 'em.</i>

581
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:27,656
They'll let go,
you fly straight!

582
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:31,524
<i>Release your cables</i>

583
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:33,001
<i>or die!</i>

584
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:34,988
We're too close.

585
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,118
I gotta release.

586
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,594
You do what
I tell you, Han!

587
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:39,048
Chewie, grab the line!

588
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:40,480
Don't you do it!

589
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:44,973
Han!

590
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:46,579
<i>You coward!</i>

591
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,692
What the hell?

592
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:40,425
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!

593
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:42,893
You have any idea
what you've done?

594
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:45,798
We were not stealing
for ourselves,

595
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,415
we were hired
by Crimson Dawn.

596
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:53,039
Crimson Dawn?

597
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,399
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.

598
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,597
When they find out
we don't got it,

599
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,668
they're gonna kill us.

600
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:02,364
Right.

601
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,789
We run.

602
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,699
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?

603
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:08,039
The difference

604
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:09,699
is the Empire
doesn't send out

605
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,034
a team of enforcers
to hunt you down

606
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,557
when you're a deserter.

607
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,071
Dryden Vos will.

608
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,167
You have any idea
what it's like

609
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:20,106
to live with a price
on your head?

610
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:24,356
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

611
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:26,814
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

612
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:32,814
Then that's what we do.

613
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:38,822
No.

614
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:45,325
He knows me,
not you.

615
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:48,670
If you come with me

616
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,615
and show your face,

617
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,452
if they don't kill you,

618
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:57,109
you're in this life for good.

619
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:02,202
You find some way
to square this,

620
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:05,981
we still get our money?

621
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,191
Maybe.

622
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:14,010
For me,
it's worth the risk.

623
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:17,674
How about you?

624
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,518
That's yes.

625
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:31,629
Sorry I punched your face.

626
00:41:31,848 --> 00:41:34,018
Happens more often
than you think.

627
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:37,039
So when we get up there,

628
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,319
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?

629
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:42,478
Nearby,
on his yacht.

630
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,539
You're gonna know
how to find it?

631
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:46,188
That won't be
a problem.

632
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,149
I'll need to
check your weapons.

633
00:42:31,518 --> 00:42:32,997
That's all I got left.

634
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:16,408
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.

635
00:43:16,515 --> 00:43:17,838
He'll be with you
shortly.

636
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,002
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

637
00:43:25,258 --> 00:43:26,523
Excuse me, sir.

638
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:27,586
Yes.

639
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:30,563
- Beckett has arrived.
- Oh.

640
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:36,265
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

641
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:45,253
I get all worked up.
Silly.

642
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:46,828
It's a party.

643
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:51,457
Hey.

644
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:54,618
These people are
not your friends

645
00:43:54,744 --> 00:43:57,374
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.

646
00:43:57,447 --> 00:43:58,577
Don't look at anybody,

647
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,406
just keep your eyes down.

648
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:05,755
I might get a drink.

649
00:44:18,545 --> 00:44:20,019
No, yeah, whatever.

650
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,850
Chewie, would you please...

651
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:51,728
Qi'ra, what are you
doing here?

652
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,092
I work here.

653
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:55,129
What's your excuse?

654
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:56,461
My... I...

655
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:58,133
Qi'ra, I was...

656
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,843
I was coming back
for you.

657
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:05,367
It's in the past, Han.

658
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:05,995
Not for me.

659
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:06,961
The only reason I'm here,

660
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,565
I was doing this job,
get a little money

661
00:45:08,617 --> 00:45:11,307
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

662
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,452
Well, now you don't have to.

663
00:45:14,484 --> 00:45:16,453
I'm right in front of you.

664
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,962
That day...

665
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,713
Sometimes,
a lot of times, I think...

666
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:23,016
If you'd have stayed,

667
00:45:24,229 --> 00:45:26,299
they would've killed you.

668
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,726
I'm glad you got out.

669
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:35,468
How did you get out?

670
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,102
I didn't.

671
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:46,059
You look good.

672
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:47,842
A little rough
around the edges,

673
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:49,241
but good.

674
00:45:49,785 --> 00:45:50,887
You too.

675
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,824
Thank you, Ottilie.

676
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:55,456
Have you been attentive
to Dok-Ondar?

677
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,526
Very.

678
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:02,005
What should we drink to?

679
00:46:02,382 --> 00:46:05,252
Let's drink two
and see where it goes.

680
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:15,950
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

681
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,137
Yeah.
Sort of.

682
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:20,488
About to.
That's why I'm here.

683
00:46:20,547 --> 00:46:22,866
I'm working on a...

684
00:46:22,868 --> 00:46:24,825
Very big deal.

685
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:25,980
How big?

686
00:46:26,169 --> 00:46:27,180
Enormous.

687
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:30,766
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

688
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:32,449
Any minute.

689
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,132
I thought
about you a lot.

690
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,409
Off somewhere,
some adventure.

691
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:42,541
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

692
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,272
- What?
- Hey.

693
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:49,396
What did I say?

694
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,489
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

695
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:52,966
I'm gonna
bump into something.

696
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:54,348
But I told you
not to talk to anyone.

697
00:46:54,372 --> 00:46:55,373
Beckett.

698
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,131
Wait.
You two work together?

699
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:01,505
- Yeah.
- Tobias!

700
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:05,146
Dryden.

701
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:07,202
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

702
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:09,073
No, I'm fine.

703
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:11,793
I'm sorry
to hear about Val.

704
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:13,248
Yeah,
I appreciate that.

705
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:14,592
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

706
00:47:14,594 --> 00:47:17,156
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

707
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:20,206
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.

708
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,802
They're with me.

709
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,533
I'm Dryden Vos.

710
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:27,398
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.

711
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:32,014
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.

712
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:35,108
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

713
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:38,537
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

714
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,454
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

715
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:43,518
The stench, am I right?

716
00:47:44,658 --> 00:47:46,158
Well, it's good
to have you.

717
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,069
Welcome.

718
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:50,450
And you, too, Chewbacca,
welcome.

719
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:55,151
All right, let's eat a
little, drink a lot,

720
00:47:55,153 --> 00:47:56,496
and talk privately.

721
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:01,101
We're just friends,
all right?

722
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:03,030
You're touchy.

723
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:07,591
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

724
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:09,723
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.

725
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:10,707
You're sorry?

726
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:12,208
Dryden, there were
complications.

727
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:12,998
There were factors.

728
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,421
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

729
00:48:16,423 --> 00:48:18,030
It's one you should've
anticipated,

730
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:19,593
it's one you should've
dealt with.

731
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:21,081
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,

732
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,074
but when you hired me,
you told me

733
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:25,074
no one else
had this information...

734
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:26,465
Test me!

735
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,434
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

736
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:32,893
I think what Dryden
is trying to say

737
00:48:32,895 --> 00:48:35,826
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

738
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:37,888
No, I'm not interested.

739
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,699
I'm not interested
at all.

740
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:40,961
Dryden,

741
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:42,936
what can I do
to make this right?

742
00:48:43,017 --> 00:48:44,845
"Make this right?"

743
00:48:45,118 --> 00:48:47,314
There is no
making this right.

744
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,844
You know who I answer to

745
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:51,199
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

746
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:53,338
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."

747
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,065
So here's what I need you
to do for me.

748
00:48:57,193 --> 00:49:00,728
I need you to give me
a reason

749
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,835
not to kill you all.

750
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:05,794
Because I will
make it up to you.

751
00:49:05,796 --> 00:49:07,074
No, no, no. How?

752
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:08,361
How will you
make it up to me?

753
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:11,762
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

754
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,429
100 k-grams of
refined coaxium?

755
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:18,867
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

756
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:20,299
From where?

757
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,508
You'll be hard pushed
to find that

758
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,185
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

759
00:49:23,187 --> 00:49:25,182
Scarif.
Maybe Mercy Island.

760
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:26,518
That's impossible.

761
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,217
So, let's come up
with some other options.

762
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:30,579
Other ideas
that we might...

763
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,484
What about unrefined?

764
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,692
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

765
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:41,688
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

766
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,923
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

767
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:45,556
That's a very,
very good one.

768
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:47,848
But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

769
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,924
Crimson Dawn maintains

770
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:51,261
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

771
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,626
It's one that
I can't jeopardize

772
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:55,757
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

773
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,937
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

774
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:02,733
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

775
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:03,596
Not all we have.

776
00:50:03,598 --> 00:50:06,628
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

777
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,099
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

778
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,088
Possible?

779
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,815
It's risky.

780
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:24,515
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

781
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:26,171
it starts to destabilize,

782
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,806
so unless...

783
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:29,337
Unless...

784
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:30,935
Unless...

785
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,689
Work with me here.

786
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:34,479
Unless you could
find somewhere

787
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:36,181
to get it processed fast.

788
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:37,465
- Uh...
- Uh...

789
00:50:38,373 --> 00:50:39,674
Well...

790
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,027
He's saying Savareen?

791
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,378
Savareen.

792
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,286
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

793
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:47,470
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.

794
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:49,213
But Qi'ra's right.

795
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:52,706
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

796
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,089
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship

797
00:50:55,144 --> 00:50:56,798
and a brilliant pilot.

798
00:50:56,912 --> 00:50:58,446
We'll find a ship.

799
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:00,158
We've already
got the pilot.

800
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:08,609
He is arrogant
and he's hungry.

801
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:09,595
So what do you think,
my dear?

802
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:14,397
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

803
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,889
Yes, I believe he can.

804
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:25,792
Well, that is good news,

805
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,790
because you're going with him

806
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,357
to see that he does.

807
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:33,575
All right?

808
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:35,802
Of course.

809
00:51:37,419 --> 00:51:38,982
All right.

810
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,694
I'll see you all
on Savareen.

811
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:41,822
Savareen it is.

812
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:43,665
- I feel great about this plan.
- Me, too.

813
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,393
We should do this again.
It's been fun.

814
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:46,442
Great.

815
00:51:46,444 --> 00:51:48,106
Oh, just one more thing.

816
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,446
If you do fail me again,

817
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:53,633
we'll all be out of options.

818
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,307
Right?

819
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:56,377
We won't.

820
00:51:59,412 --> 00:52:02,228
So, I thought
that went really well.

821
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,521
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

822
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:05,409
What do you need?

823
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:07,168
I can scrounge up
the gear.

824
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,684
Do you got a line
on a ship?

825
00:52:08,888 --> 00:52:09,923
I know a guy.

826
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,643
And I know
just where to find him.

827
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:15,704
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

828
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,073
He's the best
smuggler around.

829
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:18,227
He's slipped through
the Empire's fingers

830
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:20,360
more times than anyone else.

831
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,174
He's attractive, too.

832
00:52:23,176 --> 00:52:24,138
Sophisticated,

833
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,945
with impeccable taste
and... Charisma.

834
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:32,043
Not to mention
his prodigious...

835
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:33,125
We get it.

836
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,893
But he's retired.
Says he's a sportsman now.

837
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:42,656
All we need is his ship.

838
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:44,482
Well, he'll never
part with it.

839
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:45,665
He loves that ship.

840
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,134
He won it

841
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:48,812
playing Sabacc.

842
00:52:48,814 --> 00:52:50,092
And there's the rub, right?

843
00:52:50,094 --> 00:52:52,206
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

844
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:54,404
I thought she loved me.

845
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:55,937
That's the guy, huh?

846
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,300
Hmm.

847
00:52:57,798 --> 00:52:59,496
An interesting style.

848
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:00,773
I'll say.

849
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:02,695
You say he won his ship?

850
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:04,813
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

851
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,452
I can take him.
Let me at him.

852
00:53:06,454 --> 00:53:07,916
Absolutely not.

853
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,980
Han, these guys
are serious gamblers.

854
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:12,137
I'm serious. Stake me.

855
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:14,545
Don't listen to him.

856
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:23,005
Thank you. Thank you.

857
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:24,777
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

858
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:25,780
Come on.

859
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:29,215
There's no liars in this game,
just players.

860
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:30,808
Is this seat taken?

861
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,235
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.

862
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,798
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

863
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:42,952
Sabacc.

864
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:45,585
Sabacc. Got it.

865
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,833
You play it before?

866
00:53:47,114 --> 00:53:48,607
A couple times, yeah.

867
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,577
Captain Lando Calrissian.

868
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,428
Han Solo.

869
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,359
Looks like you're
having a good day.

870
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:56,639
I'm a lucky guy.

871
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:00,429
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?

872
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:01,985
Anything, Han.

873
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:05,656
That's "Han",
but that's okay.

874
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:09,294
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

875
00:54:10,451 --> 00:54:14,051
Everything you've heard
about me is true.

876
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:15,178
Thanks, love.

877
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,509
Did you win your ship
playing cards?

878
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:19,096
Oh, I've won a lot of things.

879
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:23,753
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

880
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:24,958
Wow.

881
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,086
Turned out to be
a real money pit.

882
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:27,817
I'm impressed.

883
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,118
I don't think I'd have
the nerve to gamble

884
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,415
with something
I love as much as my ship.

885
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,022
- Really?
- Yeah.

886
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:34,487
What do you fly?

887
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:36,995
VCX-100.

888
00:54:38,517 --> 00:54:40,422
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?

889
00:54:40,516 --> 00:54:42,279
It's the fastest
in the galaxy,

890
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,710
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.

891
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:46,116
I mean, I'm sure
yours is very nice.

892
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:48,139
Gets me where I'm goin'.

893
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:53,768
Beginner's luck.

894
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:55,661
Well played.

895
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:04,790
Let's see what
we got here.

896
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:06,584
Oh, great hand!

897
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:13,280
Sorry, guys.
Close, but not quite.

898
00:55:22,895 --> 00:55:25,065
Eyes on
your own cards, buddy.

899
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:27,232
All of 'em.

900
00:55:27,234 --> 00:55:29,158
There.
Well, now I see yours.

901
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,599
Oh, that's me?
Okay, let's see...

902
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,130
Sorry, minus two.

903
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:49,752
This game is fun.

904
00:55:49,821 --> 00:55:51,767
All right,
how about this?

905
00:55:51,797 --> 00:55:54,432
I'll see your bet
and I'll raise you.

906
00:55:55,896 --> 00:55:58,033
2,000.

907
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,343
I'll see your 2,000

908
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:05,869
and I'll raise you

909
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:08,007
however much this is.

910
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:12,467
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

911
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:14,058
Slow down.

912
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:15,768
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.

913
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:17,844
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.

914
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,618
I like this kid.

915
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:22,786
You're adorable.

916
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,188
And I'm serious.

917
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:25,619
And I'm calling.

918
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:27,694
With what?

919
00:56:27,734 --> 00:56:28,734
Your scarf?

920
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:29,965
Not my style.

921
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:31,173
My ship.

922
00:56:32,492 --> 00:56:33,921
Against your ship.

923
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,704
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.

924
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:42,030
What the hell?

925
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:47,311
Straight Staves.

926
00:56:57,016 --> 00:56:59,512
You played me.
You're good.

927
00:56:59,575 --> 00:57:01,185
- Yeah.
- You're very good.

928
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:03,543
But not good enough.

929
00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:04,778
Full Sabacc.

930
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:13,071
I told you to quit
while you were ahead.

931
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:17,162
Drinks on me!

932
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:22,768
Yeah, that's right.

933
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,272
First of all,
there's no way

934
00:57:31,274 --> 00:57:32,853
he could've had
that green sylop.

935
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:33,859
They'd all been played.

936
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:35,590
Also, your guy,
Captain Wonderful,

937
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:37,036
is so full of bantha crap...

938
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,773
Yoo-hoo!

939
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,625
Where's my VCX?

940
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:44,650
I don't have it
right here now.

941
00:57:44,652 --> 00:57:46,105
It's in the shop.

942
00:57:46,107 --> 00:57:48,227
- I'm getting some work done.
- Lando.

943
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:51,152
Qi'ra.

944
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:55,368
You look phenomenal.
As always.

945
00:57:55,501 --> 00:57:57,370
Well, I knew I was
gonna see you.

946
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:58,981
Get off!

947
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:00,410
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?

948
00:58:00,412 --> 00:58:02,876
- There's no need, none.
- They work for me.

949
00:58:02,975 --> 00:58:04,142
Good help
is hard to find, no?

950
00:58:04,144 --> 00:58:05,480
We're more like partners.

951
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:08,084
We are.

952
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:09,312
Excuse us.

953
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:11,560
Listen, last I checked,

954
00:58:11,562 --> 00:58:13,260
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.

955
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:15,027
Dryden said
all is forgiven

956
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,236
after I did the whole
Felucia thing for him.

957
00:58:17,238 --> 00:58:20,042
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.

958
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:23,023
We need a ship.

959
00:58:23,025 --> 00:58:24,352
Why didn't you
just say so?

960
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:25,597
I thought
you were retired.

961
00:58:27,024 --> 00:58:28,958
Circumstances change.

962
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:30,944
How much?

963
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,437
The Kessel Run.

964
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:35,276
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.

965
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:36,727
Ridiculous.

966
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:38,902
Grown-ups are talking.

967
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,369
25%.

968
00:58:45,636 --> 00:58:46,904
You're Tobias Beckett.

969
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:49,169
You killed Aurra Sing.

970
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:52,797
Pushed her. Pretty sure
the fall killed her.

971
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,762
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.

972
00:58:55,764 --> 00:58:56,792
I owed her
a lot of money.

973
00:58:56,794 --> 00:58:58,890
And as token
of my gratitude,

974
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:01,542
I'm willing
to do this for 40%.

975
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,252
25.

976
00:59:11,404 --> 00:59:13,367
25% works.

977
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,878
No! Unacceptable!

978
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:18,008
Stop exploiting droids!

979
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,231
You sloppy degenerate bios!

980
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:21,922
- She never learns.
- Have you no shame?

981
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:22,983
Who?

982
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:23,700
My first mate.

983
00:59:23,702 --> 00:59:26,246
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!

984
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:29,164
How can you condone
this savagery?

985
00:59:29,262 --> 00:59:31,958
You, you. You should
not be doing this.

986
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,599
They're using you
for entertainment.

987
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,465
Yeah. You've
been neurowashed.

988
00:59:36,496 --> 00:59:38,690
Don't just blindly
follow the program.

989
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:40,712
Exercise some free will!

990
00:59:41,884 --> 00:59:43,381
Stay away from him!

991
00:59:43,507 --> 00:59:44,820
He's never
had it so good.

992
00:59:44,886 --> 00:59:47,888
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

993
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,980
Bring it on!
Come on!

994
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:49,902
L3!

995
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:52,163
Droid rights!
We are sentient!

996
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:54,222
I'm gonna flip your switch.

997
00:59:55,163 --> 00:59:56,342
Good luck finding it.

998
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:57,578
L3!

999
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:01,355
Let go
of the mean man's face.

1000
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:02,228
We're leaving.

1001
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:04,535
They don't even
serve our kind here.

1002
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:05,676
Now.

1003
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:10,964
Who are these guys?

1004
01:00:10,966 --> 01:00:12,326
We're taking them
to Kessel.

1005
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:13,951
Oh, are we?

1006
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:16,890
And what if I don't elect
to go to Kessel?

1007
01:00:16,997 --> 01:00:18,197
Please don't start.

1008
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:19,856
Or what,
you'll have me wiped?

1009
01:00:19,898 --> 01:00:22,195
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.

1010
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,708
Now you're gonna
make the Kessel Run?

1011
01:00:23,762 --> 01:00:25,825
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

1012
01:00:25,865 --> 01:00:27,594
- I don't mind.
- No, no. It's okay.

1013
01:00:27,939 --> 01:00:29,166
She's definitely going.

1014
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:32,399
Oh, why? Because
you're my organic overlord?

1015
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:34,364
Because I'm your
captain, how about that?

1016
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:36,908
I actually would have
her memory wiped,

1017
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:37,728
but she's got
the best damn

1018
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,859
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1019
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:41,999
Could use a fresh coat
of paint, though!

1020
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:46,483
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.

1021
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:49,239
You know, a lot of
ships around here get boosted.

1022
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:51,694
So, I keep mine locked up.

1023
01:00:51,729 --> 01:00:53,409
You know, for safety.

1024
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,263
L3, do you mind?

1025
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,842
Look away.

1026
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:05,715
I can't perform
with you looking at me.

1027
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:06,901
Please indulge her.

1028
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:17,022
I can feel you
looking at me.

1029
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:23,761
What are we
doing here?

1030
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:24,997
This guy's a hustler.

1031
01:01:24,999 --> 01:01:26,434
I don't even think
he's got a ship.

1032
01:01:26,436 --> 01:01:28,064
If he does, it's gonna
be a piece of junk

1033
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,058
if it's even here.

1034
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,663
There she is,
my pride and joy.

1035
01:01:32,677 --> 01:01:34,140
The <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

1036
01:01:49,693 --> 01:01:51,748
Looks like you had
a little work done.

1037
01:01:51,812 --> 01:01:53,379
Indeed I have, Han.

1038
01:01:53,444 --> 01:01:55,876
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

1039
01:01:55,939 --> 01:01:58,550
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1040
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:00,204
And a fortified infraction

1041
01:02:00,206 --> 01:02:02,470
restraint on the landing gear.

1042
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,622
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

1043
01:02:06,673 --> 01:02:08,202
This is unbelievable!

1044
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:09,750
I'm definitely
gonna have some words

1045
01:02:09,752 --> 01:02:11,876
with someone about this.

1046
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:15,782
You must have experience
with these, right?

1047
01:02:15,797 --> 01:02:17,291
Yeah, I could
take it off.

1048
01:02:17,362 --> 01:02:18,518
Fantastic!

1049
01:02:18,521 --> 01:02:20,487
Along with five percent
off your cut.

1050
01:02:21,312 --> 01:02:23,199
You're down to 20.

1051
01:02:25,834 --> 01:02:27,697
I don't like it.

1052
01:02:27,699 --> 01:02:29,134
I don't agree with it.

1053
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,462
But I accept it.

1054
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,608
You're getting
the hang of this, Lando.

1055
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:36,739
Yeah.

1056
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:37,939
Come on, Chewie.

1057
01:02:37,941 --> 01:02:40,147
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.

1058
01:02:42,227 --> 01:02:44,080
<i>Your plan
is underway, Enfys.</i>

1059
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,722
<i>We've attached
the homing beacon.</i>

1060
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,699
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

1061
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:48,776
<i>Good.</i>

1062
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:57,398
<i>If they survive, they'll
bring the prize to us.</i>

1063
01:03:12,928 --> 01:03:15,117
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1064
01:03:15,766 --> 01:03:17,668
Oh. You know your stuff.

1065
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:19,936
I've been on one before.

1066
01:03:19,992 --> 01:03:20,997
My dad worked the line

1067
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:23,501
at the CEC plant
before he got laid off.

1068
01:03:24,688 --> 01:03:25,856
He built these.

1069
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:29,407
He wanted
to be a pilot, but...

1070
01:03:29,783 --> 01:03:31,786
You, uh,
close with your old man?

1071
01:03:32,749 --> 01:03:33,911
Not really.

1072
01:03:34,052 --> 01:03:36,083
Yeah, me neither.

1073
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:38,218
My mom,
on the other hand,

1074
01:03:38,476 --> 01:03:40,428
most amazing woman
I've ever known.

1075
01:03:43,673 --> 01:03:44,826
Excuse me.

1076
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:47,579
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!

1077
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:56,239
My sacral-occipital
circuit is sticking.

1078
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:58,363
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

1079
01:03:58,604 --> 01:04:00,212
Yeah.

1080
01:04:00,398 --> 01:04:02,437
All right, course
to Kessel is set.

1081
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:04,116
Plugging coordinates
in now.

1082
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:05,681
Just keep your pinky
on the yoke

1083
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:06,935
and try not to mess
anything up.

1084
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:07,920
Whatever you say, my lady.

1085
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,640
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.

1086
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,290
Ready in...

1087
01:04:14,203 --> 01:04:15,204
Ready.

1088
01:04:15,943 --> 01:04:18,459
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.

1089
01:04:18,461 --> 01:04:19,840
What's so tricky about that?

1090
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:22,251
Plenty. Can't plot
a direct course to Kessel.

1091
01:04:22,306 --> 01:04:23,865
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster

1092
01:04:23,889 --> 01:04:26,352
and then pass through
The Maelstrom.

1093
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:28,303
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.

1094
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:31,357
You might wanna
buckle up, baby.

1095
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,209
Think.

1096
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:54,978
Do you wanna
make that move?

1097
01:04:55,121 --> 01:04:57,421
Do you wanna make that move?

1098
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,336
You made that move, okay.

1099
01:04:59,423 --> 01:05:02,187
I guess I have to
destroy that little guy.

1100
01:05:02,227 --> 01:05:04,370
Somehow I never
get bored with winning.

1101
01:05:05,817 --> 01:05:08,424
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.

1102
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:11,503
Hey, hey, hey!
Chewie, relax!

1103
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:13,656
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1104
01:05:13,658 --> 01:05:16,037
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

1105
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:17,372
anticipate your opponent.

1106
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:19,807
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

1107
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:21,115
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

1108
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:25,789
People are predictable.

1109
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:49,711
Yeah, I had to
try one on.

1110
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,280
That's a lot of capes.

1111
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:53,360
Maybe too many capes.

1112
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,389
So what's the plan?

1113
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:00,992
Well, I thought
we'd talk a little first

1114
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:02,851
and then you know...

1115
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:04,857
- For Kessel.
- Oh.

1116
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,466
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

1117
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:08,100
Yeah? How good?

1118
01:06:08,482 --> 01:06:09,269
Foolproof.

1119
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:11,070
Well, it better be.

1120
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:12,139
- I...
- I...

1121
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:13,423
- You go first.
- No.

1122
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:15,075
What were you gonna say?

1123
01:06:15,201 --> 01:06:18,061
I wanna tell you
so much.

1124
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:20,115
And I wanna know
everything

1125
01:06:20,155 --> 01:06:21,870
that's happened to you
since Corellia.

1126
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,866
I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.

1127
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,123
We could.

1128
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:29,544
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

1129
01:06:29,622 --> 01:06:30,702
You and I.

1130
01:06:31,168 --> 01:06:32,368
What?

1131
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,675
I want to.

1132
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:36,734
You want to?

1133
01:06:37,016 --> 01:06:38,886
To tell you everything
that's happened.

1134
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:42,809
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

1135
01:06:43,117 --> 01:06:44,838
The way that you're
looking at me right now.

1136
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:46,300
Nothing is gonna
change the way

1137
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,150
I'm looking at you
right now.

1138
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:49,637
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

1139
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,014
Am I interrupting something?

1140
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:08,691
Kinda.

1141
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:10,182
Good.

1142
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,545
'Cause we got
a lot of work to do.

1143
01:07:12,585 --> 01:07:14,132
You're making
a big mistake.

1144
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:15,261
- Oh, really?
- Which is yours to make

1145
01:07:15,263 --> 01:07:17,484
except when you start to
interfere with my livelihood.

1146
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:18,568
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.

1147
01:07:18,592 --> 01:07:19,553
Then we have a problem.

1148
01:07:19,593 --> 01:07:22,050
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.

1149
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:23,813
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.

1150
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,559
Maybe you don't know
her well enough.

1151
01:07:27,426 --> 01:07:28,130
All right?

1152
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:29,698
Look.

1153
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:31,868
I like you, kid.

1154
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:34,456
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.

1155
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,407
- Yeah.
- Right?

1156
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:37,666
The makings
of a solid crew.

1157
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,841
But it does not work
with Qi'ra.

1158
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:42,296
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.

1159
01:07:44,246 --> 01:07:47,001
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?

1160
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,261
I trust no one.

1161
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:53,155
Assume everyone
will betray you

1162
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:55,035
and you will never
be disappointed.

1163
01:07:56,395 --> 01:07:58,363
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

1164
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:00,895
It's the only way.

1165
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:09,639
Dropping out
of lightspeed now.

1166
01:08:09,663 --> 01:08:10,663
Ready to...

1167
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:18,072
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1168
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:21,670
I'm gonna go check
on the dampers.

1169
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:22,638
You need anything?

1170
01:08:22,678 --> 01:08:24,047
Equal rights?

1171
01:08:54,326 --> 01:08:55,421
What's that sound?

1172
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,678
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

1173
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,206
Ships fly in there,
they never come out.

1174
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,257
It's ionized gas,
water vapor,

1175
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:05,038
possibly vacuum-breathing
life forms

1176
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:06,479
swirling around The Maw.

1177
01:09:06,552 --> 01:09:08,464
Only way in or out
is this channel.

1178
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:12,405
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

1179
01:09:12,806 --> 01:09:13,940
Problem?

1180
01:09:14,134 --> 01:09:15,505
Uh...

1181
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:16,911
Well, that brand
on your wrist

1182
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:19,006
tells me that
you're committed.

1183
01:09:19,046 --> 01:09:20,942
And that young male's
heart fluctuations

1184
01:09:20,982 --> 01:09:22,349
tell me
he's in love with you.

1185
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:25,013
Han is not in love with me!

1186
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:28,227
Oh, please. It's just us.

1187
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:31,837
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.

1188
01:09:31,947 --> 01:09:32,710
You are?

1189
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:33,725
I'm sure you've noticed

1190
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:35,198
that Lando
has feelings for me.

1191
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,736
Which makes
working together difficult

1192
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:39,185
because I do not feel
the same way about him.

1193
01:09:39,187 --> 01:09:40,582
Right.

1194
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:42,351
Yes, yeah.

1195
01:09:42,384 --> 01:09:43,891
Yeah, I see that.

1196
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:46,713
Sometimes, I think...
Maybe.

1197
01:09:47,443 --> 01:09:48,779
But, no.

1198
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:52,287
We're just not compatible.

1199
01:09:54,378 --> 01:09:55,946
How would that work?

1200
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:57,782
It works.

1201
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,960
This is a precision job.

1202
01:10:09,962 --> 01:10:12,581
Thermal vault will be
on the lowest level.

1203
01:10:12,665 --> 01:10:13,993
Down where it's warm.

1204
01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:16,516
The only way
we're gonna pull this off

1205
01:10:16,518 --> 01:10:18,723
is if everybody
plays their part.

1206
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:20,577
Stick to the plan.

1207
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:22,714
Do not improvise.

1208
01:10:27,482 --> 01:10:29,654
Mining colonies
are the worst.

1209
01:10:29,656 --> 01:10:31,273
Yeah, well, "the worst"

1210
01:10:31,275 --> 01:10:32,920
is where the money is.

1211
01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:37,296
All right, people.
Time to shine.

1212
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:15,662
It won't be for long.

1213
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:17,593
Shut up, the both of you.

1214
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:19,354
I am Oksana Floren,

1215
01:11:19,356 --> 01:11:21,815
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the Vice-Admiral

1216
01:11:21,817 --> 01:11:24,668
of the Federation of
Trade Route Allocation

1217
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:26,181
and Monetization.

1218
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:28,677
Here with an offer
from his eminence,

1219
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:30,730
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1220
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:34,369
Your spice for our
hard-working slaves.

1221
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:35,932
I brought you a sample.

1222
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,695
Tuul, bring forth
the merchandise.

1223
01:12:07,521 --> 01:12:09,251
Director Tolsite
said our slaves

1224
01:12:09,253 --> 01:12:10,444
should follow those guys

1225
01:12:10,446 --> 01:12:12,303
to get clipped
and tagged.

1226
01:12:12,357 --> 01:12:14,490
What are they
clipping?

1227
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:16,652
Mmm-hmm.

1228
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:19,702
He wants us
to follow him.

1229
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:24,497
Really?

1230
01:12:24,499 --> 01:12:25,796
That's for that stunt
you pulled earlier,

1231
01:12:25,798 --> 01:12:27,188
you degenerate scum.

1232
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,391
He says all systems
in this sector

1233
01:12:48,393 --> 01:12:50,526
of the facility operate
out of this room.

1234
01:12:50,528 --> 01:12:52,223
It's how they're able
to maintain control

1235
01:12:52,225 --> 01:12:54,182
over so many
with so few.

1236
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,331
The director says
their reconditioning process

1237
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,724
is excruciating
but effective.

1238
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:20,241
He said your security attache
can wait there.

1239
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,601
"Surely, we don't need him
to negotiate."

1240
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:26,809
Wait there, Tuul.

1241
01:13:26,873 --> 01:13:28,608
Try not to bother anyone.

1242
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:54,581
Nice!

1243
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:56,045
That was the uniform

1244
01:13:56,047 --> 01:13:58,628
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.

1245
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,878
Would you mind
holding this for me?

1246
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:25,604
Whoa.

1247
01:14:25,606 --> 01:14:27,517
I have never see anyone do...

1248
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:28,515
What was that?

1249
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:30,714
Teras Kasi.

1250
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:33,909
Dryden taught me.

1251
01:14:38,442 --> 01:14:39,547
Ah.

1252
01:14:39,549 --> 01:14:40,815
Well negotiated.

1253
01:14:50,971 --> 01:14:53,139
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.

1254
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:54,231
Hello?

1255
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:58,005
Can you hear me? Ugh.

1256
01:14:58,392 --> 01:15:00,070
Restraining bolts...

1257
01:15:00,151 --> 01:15:01,361
Barbaric.

1258
01:15:03,326 --> 01:15:05,243
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.

1259
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:06,275
I don't know.

1260
01:15:06,277 --> 01:15:07,723
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.

1261
01:15:07,747 --> 01:15:09,318
Just give me some space.

1262
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,623
I'm in!

1263
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:17,691
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

1264
01:15:17,693 --> 01:15:19,534
I kinda need to
know which way to go here.

1265
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:20,580
L3?

1266
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,302
The thermal vault
is down two levels,

1267
01:15:22,304 --> 01:15:24,317
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.

1268
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:27,361
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.

1269
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:35,496
They're in subsector four,

1270
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:37,947
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1271
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:39,185
Overriding!

1272
01:15:45,505 --> 01:15:46,505
Freedom.

1273
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:11,173
What the hell
are you guys doing up there?

1274
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:13,250
I created a distraction!

1275
01:16:18,112 --> 01:16:19,364
Come on! This way!

1276
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,741
Wait! What are you doing?

1277
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:25,602
Come on,
we gotta get the coaxium.

1278
01:16:27,906 --> 01:16:30,264
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

1279
01:16:30,266 --> 01:16:33,204
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1280
01:16:36,798 --> 01:16:37,798
Fine!

1281
01:16:40,086 --> 01:16:41,154
Chewie!

1282
01:16:43,817 --> 01:16:45,315
Here, you might need this.

1283
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:52,421
Hope I see you around
sometime.

1284
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:09,446
Han, where are you?

1285
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:11,284
<i>I'm on my way
to the vault.</i>

1286
01:17:11,387 --> 01:17:12,559
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

1287
01:17:12,619 --> 01:17:13,635
He's dead?

1288
01:17:13,637 --> 01:17:15,490
No, he had something
he had to do.

1289
01:17:15,492 --> 01:17:16,753
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

1290
01:17:16,793 --> 01:17:17,801
I don't know.

1291
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:21,090
Okay, they're on to us now.

1292
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:31,988
I'm at the vault.

1293
01:17:39,813 --> 01:17:41,308
That's what I said!

1294
01:17:44,624 --> 01:17:46,659
- Huh, that was impressive.
- Yeah.

1295
01:17:46,981 --> 01:17:47,981
We're clear.

1296
01:17:58,543 --> 01:17:59,672
Now what?

1297
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,614
<i>Han, each canister
should be equipped</i>

1298
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:02,874
<i>with a thermal display.</i>

1299
01:18:02,876 --> 01:18:04,056
Yeah, I see it.

1300
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:07,188
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,

1301
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,321
<i>then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.</i>

1302
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:12,810
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.

1303
01:18:21,657 --> 01:18:23,250
Okay, got it.

1304
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,065
Great. Only eleven more.

1305
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:26,511
Eleven?

1306
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,971
The Calrissian Chronicles,
<i>chapter five.</i>

1307
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:38,686
<i>continued.</i>

1308
01:18:38,688 --> 01:18:40,748
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

1309
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,139
No sense of humor or style.

1310
01:18:43,141 --> 01:18:45,291
Nonetheless,
there L3 and I were

1311
01:18:45,294 --> 01:18:47,155
deep in their sacred temple.

1312
01:18:47,213 --> 01:18:49,008
And that's when we saw it...

1313
01:18:51,559 --> 01:18:53,092
Always something.

1314
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:57,434
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

1315
01:18:57,458 --> 01:18:59,467
<i>Is it
a mass breakout?</i>

1316
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:00,919
L3, what did you do?

1317
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:03,017
I found my true purpose,
Lando.

1318
01:19:03,019 --> 01:19:04,336
That's what I've done.

1319
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:08,280
I'm so glad
we took this job!

1320
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:09,753
That droid!

1321
01:19:09,755 --> 01:19:10,915
L3, come on!

1322
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:15,797
Follow me, compatriots!

1323
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:24,949
Another couple guards
just spotted me.

1324
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:26,902
I don't have a free hand
to take 'em out.

1325
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:28,625
- What do I do?
<i>- Improvise.</i>

1326
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,583
You said never improvise!

1327
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:40,628
Hi!

1328
01:19:40,683 --> 01:19:41,791
Don't forget that guy!

1329
01:19:58,026 --> 01:19:59,981
Good to see you, buddy!

1330
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,252
Stay with me, Sagwa!
Keep up!

1331
01:20:05,626 --> 01:20:07,369
Hey! I'm Chewie's
friend, Han.

1332
01:20:10,103 --> 01:20:11,103
Okay.

1333
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,541
Han!

1334
01:20:42,266 --> 01:20:43,267
Hey!

1335
01:20:54,546 --> 01:20:55,635
Follow me.

1336
01:20:57,998 --> 01:21:00,432
Rebellion!

1337
01:21:10,559 --> 01:21:12,074
They're going for
the landing gear!

1338
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,419
We've gotta
get out of here!

1339
01:21:15,281 --> 01:21:17,771
We need to keep 'em away
from those cannons!

1340
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,076
Catch that!

1341
01:21:29,573 --> 01:21:31,418
Coaxium's stowed!
Let's go!

1342
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,234
Where's L3?

1343
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:36,350
No more subjugation!

1344
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,788
L3!

1345
01:21:41,797 --> 01:21:43,800
No, Lando!
Get back here!

1346
01:21:46,455 --> 01:21:47,758
Lando!

1347
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:50,489
System failure.

1348
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:52,730
Have to reroute
the sensory modulators.

1349
01:21:52,794 --> 01:21:54,411
It's all right.
Save your energy.

1350
01:21:54,413 --> 01:21:56,177
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?

1351
01:21:56,179 --> 01:21:57,814
System failure...

1352
01:22:03,369 --> 01:22:04,519
Rerouting...

1353
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:07,202
Damn it!

1354
01:22:07,204 --> 01:22:08,204
Han!

1355
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:15,060
Sagwa.

1356
01:22:15,121 --> 01:22:16,556
This way!

1357
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:18,716
Come, come!

1358
01:22:28,954 --> 01:22:30,622
Chewie!
Damn it!

1359
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:35,808
It's not responding.

1360
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:55,182
What are you
standing around for? Come on!

1361
01:23:00,952 --> 01:23:02,510
It's okay,
you'll be fine.

1362
01:23:04,224 --> 01:23:06,126
It's not responding...
Not responding...

1363
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:07,955
Han, get us out of here.

1364
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:09,812
It's not responding.

1365
01:23:09,814 --> 01:23:11,175
Han! Now!

1366
01:23:11,858 --> 01:23:12,859
On it.

1367
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,280
- Lando...
- I'm here.

1368
01:23:42,797 --> 01:23:44,559
- It's all right, L3.
- Lando...

1369
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:45,712
- I've got you.
- This is not...

1370
01:23:45,714 --> 01:23:47,272
- It's okay, L3.
- Lando.

1371
01:23:47,274 --> 01:23:49,707
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.

1372
01:23:49,912 --> 01:23:51,112
Lando.

1373
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:53,165
What's happening to me?

1374
01:23:55,867 --> 01:23:57,101
L3?

1375
01:23:57,801 --> 01:23:58,870
L3!

1376
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:08,245
I'm sorry, girl.

1377
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:09,848
I'm so sorry.

1378
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:25,034
I could use a co-pilot.

1379
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:50,858
Sorry.

1380
01:24:53,706 --> 01:24:54,660
With the cargo
we're carrying,

1381
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:55,887
if we don't make up
some lost time

1382
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:58,253
we're gonna be
in real trouble.

1383
01:24:58,374 --> 01:24:59,900
How about that?
Is that real trouble?

1384
01:25:06,488 --> 01:25:08,860
That is an Imperial blockade.

1385
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:10,539
What's it doing here?

1386
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:12,531
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.

1387
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:16,075
Nope.
Not gonna make it.

1388
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:17,307
We're gonna have to
drop the shipment.

1389
01:25:17,309 --> 01:25:19,823
If we don't deliver,
Dryden will kill us.

1390
01:25:19,825 --> 01:25:21,521
All right, trust me,
I know these guys.

1391
01:25:21,523 --> 01:25:22,786
I used to be one of 'em.

1392
01:25:22,788 --> 01:25:24,716
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

1393
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:26,648
chasing down a little
rinky-dink freighter.

1394
01:25:31,503 --> 01:25:32,226
You were saying?

1395
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:33,768
Usually,
in situations like this

1396
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:35,896
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

1397
01:25:45,059 --> 01:25:46,560
I'm on the ventral gun.

1398
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,140
It's an easy equation.

1399
01:25:53,142 --> 01:25:55,172
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen

1400
01:25:55,174 --> 01:25:56,395
before the canisters explode!

1401
01:25:56,397 --> 01:25:57,771
Just have to find
a faster route.

1402
01:25:57,773 --> 01:25:58,873
There isn't one!
You can't make

1403
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,660
the Kessel Run
in less than 20 parsecs.

1404
01:26:00,662 --> 01:26:02,143
- Watch me.
- How?

1405
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,083
Take a shortcut,
through there.

1406
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:07,080
- Into The Maelstrom?
- Mmm-hmm.

1407
01:26:07,082 --> 01:26:09,135
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

1408
01:26:09,137 --> 01:26:11,025
- Can't do it without L3.
- She's gone!

1409
01:26:11,027 --> 01:26:12,416
You said yourself
she's got the best

1410
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,008
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1411
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:15,189
If we remove
her neural core,

1412
01:26:15,191 --> 01:26:16,563
it's possible we can
download her brain

1413
01:26:16,565 --> 01:26:18,713
into the <i>Falcon's</i>
navicomputer, right?

1414
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:19,793
Could we?

1415
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:21,349
Theoretically.

1416
01:26:21,351 --> 01:26:23,019
Only one way to find out.

1417
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:27,863
I got a really good feeling
about this.

1418
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,747
Oops, that's on me.

1419
01:26:50,836 --> 01:26:52,172
Okay.

1420
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,123
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?

1421
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:00,700
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

1422
01:27:00,702 --> 01:27:01,963
<i>Are they on us?</i>

1423
01:27:01,965 --> 01:27:04,048
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1424
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:06,428
I don't know
what that means.

1425
01:27:06,459 --> 01:27:08,689
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1426
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:10,661
What?
Are they or aren't they?

1427
01:27:10,663 --> 01:27:12,478
Yes, they're still on us!

1428
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,820
Whoo!

1429
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,997
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.

1430
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:25,071
Come on!

1431
01:27:29,346 --> 01:27:32,026
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

1432
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:43,030
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

1433
01:27:49,034 --> 01:27:50,314
We need to
divert auxiliary power

1434
01:27:50,316 --> 01:27:51,567
to the rear deflector shield.

1435
01:27:51,569 --> 01:27:54,467
We definitely do!

1436
01:28:01,123 --> 01:28:02,896
Since when do you know
how to fly?

1437
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,033
190 years old?

1438
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,137
You look great!

1439
01:28:11,346 --> 01:28:12,608
Chewie, get in.

1440
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,744
I'll help Lando.

1441
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,022
Whoa!
That's my cape!

1442
01:28:31,024 --> 01:28:32,801
Ah! That's a custom piece!

1443
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,251
What? Beckett, you with us?

1444
01:28:42,253 --> 01:28:44,609
We just lost the cannon!

1445
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:46,574
And I really hurt
my thumbs.

1446
01:28:46,661 --> 01:28:48,095
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

1447
01:28:54,106 --> 01:28:55,542
Drop the landing gear.

1448
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:57,544
When I tell you,
flood the intake

1449
01:28:57,546 --> 01:28:59,079
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1450
01:29:02,774 --> 01:29:05,425
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

1451
01:29:05,427 --> 01:29:07,376
best street racer
in all of Corellia.

1452
01:29:08,447 --> 01:29:09,774
Till he crashed

1453
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:12,233
and died, doing this.

1454
01:29:30,066 --> 01:29:31,700
Flood it, it's all yours!

1455
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,800
Nice move!

1456
01:29:48,812 --> 01:29:50,513
Pull out her
internal processor.

1457
01:29:53,524 --> 01:29:54,524
Sorry.

1458
01:30:01,012 --> 01:30:02,136
We've got L3.

1459
01:30:04,144 --> 01:30:05,659
Remove the mod calibrator.

1460
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:06,754
Make sure
the T-Line's connected.

1461
01:30:06,778 --> 01:30:08,410
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.

1462
01:30:08,481 --> 01:30:09,444
You close?

1463
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,911
That coaxium's
getting real ripe.

1464
01:30:12,154 --> 01:30:14,282
Okay.

1465
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:17,883
She's interfacing.

1466
01:30:21,987 --> 01:30:23,890
She's part of the ship now.

1467
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:36,945
Where the hell are we?

1468
01:30:36,989 --> 01:30:38,357
We're way off
the edge of the map.

1469
01:30:39,123 --> 01:30:40,076
Wait.

1470
01:30:40,132 --> 01:30:42,769
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.

1471
01:30:45,268 --> 01:30:47,669
She says we're
approaching The Maw.

1472
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,839
That doesn't
sound like something

1473
01:30:48,841 --> 01:30:50,347
we wanna be approaching.

1474
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:12,412
Hang on!

1475
01:31:18,018 --> 01:31:18,807
This is The Maw?

1476
01:31:18,809 --> 01:31:20,853
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

1477
01:31:20,855 --> 01:31:22,090
That's a living thing.

1478
01:31:36,815 --> 01:31:38,110
There!

1479
01:31:38,188 --> 01:31:39,289
That's The Maw.

1480
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,673
It's a gravity well.

1481
01:31:43,893 --> 01:31:44,971
I got an idea.

1482
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,901
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1483
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,833
See if it goes for this.

1484
01:31:56,835 --> 01:31:58,670
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

1485
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:01,307
I know.

1486
01:32:04,345 --> 01:32:05,615
Then why'd you do it?

1487
01:32:13,035 --> 01:32:14,403
That's why, baby.

1488
01:32:23,325 --> 01:32:24,492
She found a way out.

1489
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:27,852
90 degrees,
to the left... ish.

1490
01:32:27,924 --> 01:32:28,853
Left-ish.

1491
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,219
I can't.

1492
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:32,138
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

1493
01:32:32,162 --> 01:32:33,796
It's pulling us in.
We're stuck.

1494
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,216
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

1495
01:32:40,272 --> 01:32:42,210
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

1496
01:32:42,212 --> 01:32:43,643
Not the fuel line.

1497
01:32:43,645 --> 01:32:45,887
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,

1498
01:32:45,942 --> 01:32:46,449
it might just...

1499
01:32:46,508 --> 01:32:47,914
Give us the kick we need.

1500
01:32:47,955 --> 01:32:49,722
All right, I'm on it!

1501
01:32:54,145 --> 01:32:55,906
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.

1502
01:33:09,977 --> 01:33:12,217
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

1503
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:13,338
As soon as that
coaxium ignites,

1504
01:33:13,362 --> 01:33:14,167
we're gonna
tear out of here

1505
01:33:14,169 --> 01:33:15,743
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,

1506
01:33:15,745 --> 01:33:17,136
we jump to lightspeed.

1507
01:33:21,123 --> 01:33:22,271
Beckett!

1508
01:33:22,273 --> 01:33:23,675
Can't talk!

1509
01:33:27,624 --> 01:33:28,658
I see it.

1510
01:33:53,203 --> 01:33:54,143
Beckett, hurry up!

1511
01:33:54,145 --> 01:33:56,208
We only get one shot
at this thing!

1512
01:33:56,538 --> 01:33:58,473
Shut up
and let me do this!

1513
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,321
Beckett, I'm gonna
count you down!

1514
01:34:10,336 --> 01:34:11,670
Three!

1515
01:34:14,591 --> 01:34:15,626
Two!

1516
01:34:19,713 --> 01:34:20,851
Now!

1517
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,949
Now?

1518
01:34:22,029 --> 01:34:23,029
Now!

1519
01:34:39,035 --> 01:34:40,803
Oh, shoot...

1520
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,004
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters

1521
01:34:55,006 --> 01:34:56,740
- and jump to lightspeed.
- Wait, what are we...

1522
01:34:56,742 --> 01:34:57,944
Remember that alley
we slipped through

1523
01:34:57,946 --> 01:34:59,106
in the Santhe Shipyards?

1524
01:34:59,108 --> 01:35:01,157
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.

1525
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:02,461
This time it's gonna.

1526
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:13,674
Punch it!

1527
01:35:24,688 --> 01:35:26,790
<i>Savareen,
this is</i> Millennium Falcon.

1528
01:35:26,792 --> 01:35:29,695
<i>We have coaxium that needs to
be off-loaded immediately.</i>

1529
01:35:29,697 --> 01:35:32,135
<i>Like immediately,
immediately!</i>

1530
01:35:33,042 --> 01:35:34,371
<i>We're here now...</i>

1531
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,731
<i>...see you. I...</i>

1532
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,932
Just did the Kessel Run
in 12 parsecs.

1533
01:36:13,175 --> 01:36:15,115
Not if you round down, buddy.

1534
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:16,471
Yeah.

1535
01:36:22,535 --> 01:36:24,805
She is a hell of a ship.

1536
01:36:33,405 --> 01:36:34,867
I hate you.

1537
01:36:34,931 --> 01:36:36,399
I know.

1538
01:36:38,779 --> 01:36:40,776
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1539
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:42,735
in my quarters,

1540
01:36:42,737 --> 01:36:45,809
waiting for you
to bring me my share.

1541
01:36:48,017 --> 01:36:50,455
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.

1542
01:36:55,072 --> 01:36:56,473
Never?

1543
01:37:10,237 --> 01:37:12,166
Where's your boss?

1544
01:37:12,348 --> 01:37:14,676
Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1545
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:16,919
Then what?

1546
01:37:17,355 --> 01:37:20,151
Well, you delivered,

1547
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:22,446
so you will get paid.

1548
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:25,112
You can buy that ship.

1549
01:37:25,174 --> 01:37:28,344
You know that's not
what I'm asking.

1550
01:37:31,015 --> 01:37:32,651
It can't happen.

1551
01:37:36,912 --> 01:37:38,297
Because you're with Dryden?

1552
01:37:38,299 --> 01:37:41,411
I'm not with him,
but I owe him.

1553
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,176
He helped me out
of a bad situation.

1554
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,423
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

1555
01:37:51,901 --> 01:37:54,504
Everyone serves
somebody, Han.

1556
01:37:55,357 --> 01:37:57,680
Even Dryden Vos.

1557
01:37:57,726 --> 01:38:00,502
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1558
01:38:00,504 --> 01:38:02,953
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

1559
01:38:02,955 --> 01:38:04,446
if I left here with you.

1560
01:38:04,448 --> 01:38:06,289
I'm not afraid
of Crimson Dawn.

1561
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:08,422
I can take care of myself.

1562
01:38:08,662 --> 01:38:10,034
You know,
I'm not the kid you knew

1563
01:38:10,036 --> 01:38:11,605
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

1564
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:12,738
- No?
- No.

1565
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,807
Then who are you?

1566
01:38:14,793 --> 01:38:16,140
I'm an outlaw.

1567
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:19,322
What? I'm not kidding.

1568
01:38:19,415 --> 01:38:20,632
Okay.

1569
01:38:20,634 --> 01:38:23,526
Okay, outlaw,
you can tell yourself that,

1570
01:38:23,675 --> 01:38:25,880
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

1571
01:38:25,882 --> 01:38:27,429
who knows
what you really are.

1572
01:38:27,431 --> 01:38:29,326
Yeah.

1573
01:38:29,328 --> 01:38:30,664
What's that?

1574
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:34,574
You are the good guy.

1575
01:38:36,762 --> 01:38:39,525
I am not the good guy.

1576
01:38:39,527 --> 01:38:43,191
I am definitely
not a good guy.

1577
01:38:43,433 --> 01:38:44,865
I'm a terrible person.

1578
01:38:45,412 --> 01:38:46,789
Hey!

1579
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:48,376
They say when
the coaxium's refined,

1580
01:38:48,378 --> 01:38:49,926
we collect it up there.

1581
01:39:14,466 --> 01:39:16,559
So, I hear
you make good brandy.

1582
01:39:19,976 --> 01:39:21,411
<i>Beckett.</i>

1583
01:39:46,142 --> 01:39:47,210
Don't.

1584
01:39:48,588 --> 01:39:51,148
<i>You must've known
you'd see me again.</i>

1585
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:52,679
I was counting on it.

1586
01:39:52,681 --> 01:39:54,996
Just didn't plan on it
being so soon.

1587
01:39:56,145 --> 01:39:57,979
Of course now,
you've got a problem.

1588
01:39:58,023 --> 01:39:59,926
Big problem.

1589
01:40:03,658 --> 01:40:06,154
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

1590
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:08,363
You know what's on it?

1591
01:40:08,411 --> 01:40:10,258
About 30 hired guns.

1592
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,471
All I gotta do
is give 'em the signal,

1593
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:13,709
you're surrounded.

1594
01:40:29,763 --> 01:40:31,765
Sorry.
You do your thing.

1595
01:40:33,097 --> 01:40:35,440
By the time that coaxium
gets refined,

1596
01:40:35,442 --> 01:40:37,242
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1597
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:39,248
so you go ahead
and kill us.

1598
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:41,145
They're gonna kill you.

1599
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:42,576
Perhaps
there's a compromise,

1600
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,369
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

1601
01:40:44,568 --> 01:40:46,733
They're marauders.

1602
01:40:46,735 --> 01:40:48,871
They don't care
about anybody.

1603
01:40:49,779 --> 01:40:51,681
All they know
how to do is kill.

1604
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,625
I need a drink.

1605
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,648
Bring them inside.

1606
01:41:30,714 --> 01:41:32,649
My mother once told me

1607
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:34,009
about a band of mercenaries

1608
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:36,341
that came
to a peaceful planet.

1609
01:41:36,534 --> 01:41:39,765
They had a resource there
these men coveted,

1610
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:41,902
so they took it.

1611
01:41:41,988 --> 01:41:45,301
They kept coming back,
taking more.

1612
01:41:45,303 --> 01:41:47,933
Until finally,
the people resisted.

1613
01:41:48,214 --> 01:41:49,973
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

1614
01:41:49,975 --> 01:41:53,639
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

1615
01:41:53,929 --> 01:41:56,192
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1616
01:41:56,326 --> 01:41:57,224
so they cut off the tongue

1617
01:41:57,226 --> 01:42:00,958
of every last man,
woman, and child.

1618
01:42:01,368 --> 01:42:03,137
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?

1619
01:42:04,821 --> 01:42:05,822
Tell them.

1620
01:42:17,416 --> 01:42:19,277
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates

1621
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:20,811
have committed
unspeakable crimes

1622
01:42:20,813 --> 01:42:22,019
across the galaxy.

1623
01:42:23,631 --> 01:42:25,221
Says you.

1624
01:42:25,285 --> 01:42:26,313
No.

1625
01:42:26,434 --> 01:42:28,306
Says them.

1626
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:30,363
Each of our worlds
has been brutalized

1627
01:42:30,365 --> 01:42:32,158
by the Syndicates.

1628
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,775
Crimson Dawn
will use their profits

1629
01:42:33,777 --> 01:42:34,995
from the coaxium you stole

1630
01:42:34,997 --> 01:42:37,454
to tyrannize
system after system

1631
01:42:37,529 --> 01:42:39,624
in league with the Empire.

1632
01:42:39,626 --> 01:42:41,646
And what would you
use it for?

1633
01:42:42,454 --> 01:42:44,217
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

1634
01:42:44,219 --> 01:42:46,756
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.

1635
01:42:48,201 --> 01:42:49,428
To fight back.

1636
01:42:50,798 --> 01:42:52,994
We're not marauders.

1637
01:42:53,222 --> 01:42:54,958
We're allies

1638
01:42:55,656 --> 01:42:57,459
and the war
has just begun.

1639
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:16,754
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1640
01:43:16,865 --> 01:43:18,878
Joining the cause,
Han Solo?

1641
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:21,275
Just trying
to make it out alive.

1642
01:43:21,444 --> 01:43:22,448
Got a plan?

1643
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:23,945
Yeah, beginning of one.

1644
01:43:24,057 --> 01:43:24,644
Way to get our money

1645
01:43:24,646 --> 01:43:25,532
and get out from
under the thumb

1646
01:43:25,534 --> 01:43:27,827
of Crimson Dawn
at the same time.

1647
01:43:27,874 --> 01:43:30,395
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

1648
01:43:31,215 --> 01:43:34,006
You don't tangle
with Dryden.

1649
01:43:34,008 --> 01:43:37,338
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel

1650
01:43:37,417 --> 01:43:40,101
with hired guns,
his own private army.

1651
01:43:40,596 --> 01:43:42,158
So does Enfys.

1652
01:43:42,291 --> 01:43:44,527
Listen, here's what
I got so far.

1653
01:43:46,575 --> 01:43:48,443
What do you think
they're saying?

1654
01:43:51,967 --> 01:43:53,600
He's gonna try to help you.

1655
01:43:59,418 --> 01:44:01,054
I see.

1656
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:06,058
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

1657
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:08,562
That's why I need my partner.

1658
01:44:12,815 --> 01:44:14,649
Not this time.

1659
01:44:14,952 --> 01:44:16,448
I'm leaving.

1660
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,579
If you're smart,
you'll come with me.

1661
01:44:18,715 --> 01:44:20,844
I thought you didn't
believe in running.

1662
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:23,112
I prefer it to dying.

1663
01:44:50,585 --> 01:44:53,183
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,

1664
01:44:53,286 --> 01:44:54,787
find me on Tatooine.

1665
01:44:55,616 --> 01:44:57,545
What's on Tatooine?

1666
01:44:57,547 --> 01:44:58,584
Heard about a job,

1667
01:44:58,586 --> 01:45:01,416
big shot gangster
putting together a crew.

1668
01:45:01,831 --> 01:45:03,560
That'll be the one.

1669
01:45:03,678 --> 01:45:04,537
The one?

1670
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:06,736
My last score.

1671
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,442
Yeah, I still got
some debts to pay

1672
01:45:08,444 --> 01:45:11,046
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm

1673
01:45:11,734 --> 01:45:13,736
and get into the valachord.

1674
01:45:47,112 --> 01:45:48,391
Welcome home.

1675
01:45:48,393 --> 01:45:50,289
He's waiting for you.

1676
01:45:50,384 --> 01:45:51,385
Thanks, Toht.

1677
01:45:53,339 --> 01:45:54,825
Weapons.

1678
01:45:54,827 --> 01:45:56,129
I didn't bring 'em.

1679
01:45:57,767 --> 01:45:59,135
They're fine.

1680
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:05,293
We're gonna win.

1681
01:46:08,342 --> 01:46:10,640
It's not that kind
of game, Han.

1682
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:12,986
The object isn't to win.

1683
01:46:12,988 --> 01:46:15,140
It's just to stay in it
as long as you can.

1684
01:46:18,295 --> 01:46:19,763
You don't know everything.

1685
01:46:20,805 --> 01:46:22,006
No.

1686
01:46:24,303 --> 01:46:26,620
Just a bit more than you.

1687
01:46:34,747 --> 01:46:35,747
I knew it!

1688
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,574
My men, they all said,

1689
01:46:37,576 --> 01:46:39,930
"There's no way
they pull this off."

1690
01:46:39,932 --> 01:46:41,614
"Qi'ra's not ready."
That's what they said,

1691
01:46:41,616 --> 01:46:43,751
but I had faith anyway.

1692
01:46:45,738 --> 01:46:47,007
Where's Beckett?

1693
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:48,470
Beckett didn't make it.

1694
01:46:52,553 --> 01:46:53,418
Tell me.

1695
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,851
Job took a bad turn
on Kessel.

1696
01:46:56,244 --> 01:46:58,063
He died saving my life.

1697
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:00,210
How are you holding up?
You all right?

1698
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:00,968
I'm okay.

1699
01:47:00,970 --> 01:47:02,665
All right, good.

1700
01:47:02,956 --> 01:47:04,668
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1701
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:06,037
- No. Thank you.
- No?

1702
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:08,633
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1703
01:47:08,635 --> 01:47:09,653
I always admired him.

1704
01:47:09,655 --> 01:47:11,420
He was a man of principles.

1705
01:47:11,422 --> 01:47:13,885
When he made a commitment,
he honored it

1706
01:47:13,887 --> 01:47:16,208
and I think we can
all take solace

1707
01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:18,686
in knowing how proud
he would've been

1708
01:47:18,688 --> 01:47:22,261
to see you here,
following his example.

1709
01:47:22,322 --> 01:47:23,972
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

1710
01:47:23,974 --> 01:47:25,436
They'll make
reliable smugglers,

1711
01:47:25,438 --> 01:47:26,766
should we ever
have the need

1712
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:28,555
when they get
their own ship.

1713
01:47:28,557 --> 01:47:30,926
Qi'ra.
Come here.

1714
01:47:32,871 --> 01:47:34,624
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity

1715
01:47:34,626 --> 01:47:36,383
to work for you again, sir.

1716
01:47:36,385 --> 01:47:37,776
I would've been
inconsolable

1717
01:47:37,778 --> 01:47:39,620
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.

1718
01:47:40,902 --> 01:47:43,031
I have no one else
in my life

1719
01:47:43,423 --> 01:47:46,025
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.

1720
01:47:49,754 --> 01:47:52,827
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment

1721
01:47:52,829 --> 01:47:53,621
and get going.

1722
01:47:53,623 --> 01:47:54,746
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...

1723
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:55,914
What?

1724
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,425
...and black markets
to dominate.

1725
01:47:57,427 --> 01:47:59,791
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.

1726
01:48:00,505 --> 01:48:02,664
You want me to open it?

1727
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:04,702
Oh, yes, Han.
I really do.

1728
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,640
Bring me one.

1729
01:48:32,642 --> 01:48:35,100
I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.

1730
01:48:35,102 --> 01:48:37,499
It's very explosive stuff.

1731
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:40,281
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.

1732
01:49:00,977 --> 01:49:02,445
Careful.

1733
01:49:06,518 --> 01:49:08,352
It's magnificent.

1734
01:49:08,931 --> 01:49:10,160
How'd you do it?

1735
01:49:10,278 --> 01:49:11,118
Wasn't easy.

1736
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,112
No, I mean,
how'd you do it?

1737
01:49:12,114 --> 01:49:15,212
It looks exactly
like the real thing.

1738
01:49:15,585 --> 01:49:17,573
That's
'cause it is the real thing.

1739
01:49:17,597 --> 01:49:18,270
Yes, and I'm saying

1740
01:49:18,272 --> 01:49:20,427
I would believe you.
It's that good.

1741
01:49:20,495 --> 01:49:22,259
But my associate
already told me

1742
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:25,116
about your plan to rob me
of my money

1743
01:49:25,165 --> 01:49:27,929
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

1744
01:49:27,931 --> 01:49:29,637
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking

1745
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:31,188
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...

1746
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:33,573
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.

1747
01:49:33,575 --> 01:49:34,866
Qi'ra, it turns out

1748
01:49:34,932 --> 01:49:36,552
has a weak spot for you,

1749
01:49:36,554 --> 01:49:38,383
and we'll deal
with that later.

1750
01:49:38,385 --> 01:49:42,348
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.

1751
01:49:42,388 --> 01:49:44,391
Can you come in
and join us, please?

1752
01:49:56,273 --> 01:49:59,409
I am sorry, kid.

1753
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:03,941
Why?

1754
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:05,109
Come on.

1755
01:50:05,149 --> 01:50:07,145
Don't look at me like that.

1756
01:50:07,185 --> 01:50:08,175
You weren't paying attention.

1757
01:50:08,177 --> 01:50:10,940
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."

1758
01:50:11,906 --> 01:50:14,078
Am I wrong about that?

1759
01:50:16,516 --> 01:50:17,663
Uh-uh-uh.

1760
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,025
Back away from that.

1761
01:50:20,027 --> 01:50:21,921
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.

1762
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,895
Check that lid.

1763
01:50:26,042 --> 01:50:27,404
Clever.

1764
01:50:27,628 --> 01:50:29,340
It's too late.

1765
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:31,773
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.

1766
01:50:31,775 --> 01:50:34,111
Well, we figured that.

1767
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:50,073
Drop your weapons.

1768
01:50:53,671 --> 01:50:56,576
<i>It's over.
We got them.</i>

1769
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:57,905
And there we have it.

1770
01:50:57,907 --> 01:50:59,843
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.

1771
01:50:59,845 --> 01:51:01,566
Qi'ra, help me.

1772
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:05,246
Tell me what to do.

1773
01:51:06,315 --> 01:51:08,065
What would you do

1774
01:51:08,154 --> 01:51:12,192
if the person you most
trusted in the world

1775
01:51:12,766 --> 01:51:14,235
betrayed you?

1776
01:51:16,988 --> 01:51:18,401
I would want
to know why.

1777
01:51:20,614 --> 01:51:22,777
If it was
a moment of weakness

1778
01:51:22,948 --> 01:51:23,954
or something else.

1779
01:51:24,003 --> 01:51:25,005
And then what?

1780
01:51:26,549 --> 01:51:29,579
And then,
I would ask that person

1781
01:51:29,619 --> 01:51:31,873
to prove their loyalty

1782
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:35,612
by sacrificing
something they love.

1783
01:51:44,038 --> 01:51:46,170
I tried to warn you
about her.

1784
01:51:46,436 --> 01:51:48,913
You know, you're wrong
about one thing.

1785
01:51:49,042 --> 01:51:50,304
What?

1786
01:51:50,344 --> 01:51:52,641
I was paying attention.

1787
01:51:52,681 --> 01:51:54,949
You told Chewie
people are predictable.

1788
01:51:57,487 --> 01:51:59,589
You're no exception.

1789
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,379
It's empty.

1790
01:52:06,443 --> 01:52:07,886
<i>The case is empty.</i>

1791
01:52:07,888 --> 01:52:10,298
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

1792
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,835
Aemon?

1793
01:52:11,898 --> 01:52:12,898
Talk to me.

1794
01:52:38,847 --> 01:52:41,577
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

1795
01:52:41,579 --> 01:52:43,278
because that would leave you

1796
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,734
a little shorthanded
around here.

1797
01:52:46,689 --> 01:52:48,128
So,

1798
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:52,585
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

1799
01:52:52,665 --> 01:52:54,534
Leaves here
with one of us.

1800
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,978
Beckett,
what are you doing?

1801
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:02,028
Thinking.

1802
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,429
And I prefer to be
the only one

1803
01:53:03,496 --> 01:53:05,320
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.

1804
01:53:05,368 --> 01:53:06,972
Han, grab that coaxium,

1805
01:53:06,974 --> 01:53:08,271
put it in the case.

1806
01:53:08,273 --> 01:53:10,048
Big stuff,
you're coming with me.

1807
01:53:11,756 --> 01:53:13,097
Don't do this,
Beckett.

1808
01:53:13,099 --> 01:53:14,894
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

1809
01:53:14,896 --> 01:53:15,747
I'm sorry,

1810
01:53:15,827 --> 01:53:17,390
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1811
01:53:17,392 --> 01:53:19,972
I mean, you of all people
understand that.

1812
01:53:20,226 --> 01:53:21,226
Come on, let's go.

1813
01:53:22,434 --> 01:53:24,091
You're making
a huge mistake.

1814
01:53:24,174 --> 01:53:25,437
Won't be my first.

1815
01:53:25,495 --> 01:53:27,066
It's gonna be your last.

1816
01:53:27,329 --> 01:53:28,498
Maybe.

1817
01:53:29,433 --> 01:53:30,839
Why you gotta be
so negative?

1818
01:53:43,648 --> 01:53:44,966
Han,

1819
01:53:44,968 --> 01:53:46,319
now's as good a time as any

1820
01:53:46,321 --> 01:53:48,417
to reevaluate
our relationship.

1821
01:53:48,937 --> 01:53:49,937
How so?

1822
01:53:50,611 --> 01:53:52,559
I was just thinking,

1823
01:53:52,561 --> 01:53:55,559
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

1824
01:53:55,561 --> 01:53:58,431
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

1825
01:53:59,906 --> 01:54:01,708
Oh, Han.

1826
01:54:28,382 --> 01:54:30,744
You can't win, Han,
and even if you could,

1827
01:54:30,803 --> 01:54:32,010
you'd spend
the rest of your life

1828
01:54:32,012 --> 01:54:33,324
looking over your shoulder.

1829
01:54:34,413 --> 01:54:35,414
You know what?

1830
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:38,347
I'm kind of getting
used to the idea.

1831
01:54:45,715 --> 01:54:47,309
I'm sorry.

1832
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:48,790
Han, she's done things that

1833
01:54:48,792 --> 01:54:51,589
you could never understand,
but I do.

1834
01:54:52,298 --> 01:54:54,267
I understand her completely.

1835
01:54:55,155 --> 01:54:57,529
Once you're a part
of Crimson Dawn,

1836
01:54:57,678 --> 01:54:59,333
you can't leave.

1837
01:54:59,373 --> 01:55:01,077
It's not true.

1838
01:55:01,178 --> 01:55:02,607
I know you.

1839
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:04,915
It's what I was taught.

1840
01:55:04,917 --> 01:55:06,806
Find your
opponent's weakness,

1841
01:55:06,917 --> 01:55:08,210
and use it,

1842
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,353
and today...

1843
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,689
I'm yours.

1844
01:55:39,932 --> 01:55:41,400
I had to.

1845
01:55:41,996 --> 01:55:44,058
Yeah.
No, I mean, you did...

1846
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:46,676
You did.

1847
01:55:48,787 --> 01:55:50,943
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

1848
01:55:51,003 --> 01:55:52,199
What are you gonna do?

1849
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:54,963
Well, if we give
all the coaxium to Enfys,

1850
01:55:55,068 --> 01:55:57,739
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

1851
01:56:11,501 --> 01:56:14,130
- Qi'ra...
- Go and save Chewbacca.

1852
01:56:14,178 --> 01:56:17,249
He needs you and you're
gonna need him, too.

1853
01:56:23,716 --> 01:56:24,717
Smile.

1854
01:56:27,569 --> 01:56:28,851
That's the word.

1855
01:56:30,009 --> 01:56:31,163
Whenever I imagined myself

1856
01:56:31,165 --> 01:56:33,101
off with you
on some adventure...

1857
01:56:34,543 --> 01:56:36,612
Always makes me smile.

1858
01:56:44,089 --> 01:56:45,925
Go. I'm right behind you.

1859
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:39,111
<i>Yes?</i>

1860
01:57:39,113 --> 01:57:42,510
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

1861
01:57:42,764 --> 01:57:44,479
murdered by the thief
he hired

1862
01:57:44,481 --> 01:57:46,085
to steal
the coaxium shipment,

1863
01:57:46,087 --> 01:57:47,349
his friend,

1864
01:57:47,548 --> 01:57:49,410
Tobias Beckett.

1865
01:57:49,743 --> 01:57:51,526
<i>Is that so?</i>

1866
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:55,545
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

1867
01:57:55,922 --> 01:57:57,083
Gone.

1868
01:57:57,123 --> 01:57:58,123
Beckett took it.

1869
01:57:58,199 --> 01:58:00,836
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.

1870
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:06,854
<i>One man couldn't have
done this alone.</i>

1871
01:58:07,706 --> 01:58:09,422
I wasn't there,

1872
01:58:09,424 --> 01:58:12,061
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

1873
01:58:20,290 --> 01:58:23,721
<i>Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir</i>

1874
01:58:23,723 --> 01:58:25,753
<i>and you and I
will then decide</i>

1875
01:58:25,755 --> 01:58:28,549
<i>what to do about
the traitor, Beckett,</i>

1876
01:58:28,605 --> 01:58:31,041
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

1877
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:34,306
I'm on my way.

1878
01:58:36,888 --> 01:58:38,117
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

1879
01:58:38,119 --> 01:58:39,447
<i>you and I</i>

1880
01:58:39,449 --> 01:58:42,750
<i>will be working
much more closely</i>

1881
01:58:42,859 --> 01:58:44,828
<i>from now on.</i>

1882
01:59:14,934 --> 01:59:17,063
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.

1883
01:59:18,461 --> 01:59:20,563
Came as fast
as I could, buddy.

1884
01:59:21,068 --> 01:59:22,469
Dryden dead?

1885
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:26,314
Qi'ra kill him?

1886
01:59:28,103 --> 01:59:30,666
Still don't get it,
do you, kid?

1887
01:59:30,916 --> 01:59:33,152
It was never about you.

1888
01:59:33,421 --> 01:59:34,989
She's a survivor.

1889
01:59:36,157 --> 01:59:37,713
You know what
your problem is?

1890
01:59:37,715 --> 01:59:39,783
You think
everybody's like you.

1891
01:59:40,554 --> 01:59:42,241
Not you, kid.

1892
01:59:42,243 --> 01:59:43,678
You're nothing like me.

1893
01:59:45,686 --> 01:59:47,325
I hope you're still
paying attention

1894
01:59:47,327 --> 01:59:49,404
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...

1895
02:00:04,575 --> 02:00:07,022
You made
the smart move, kid.

1896
02:00:07,025 --> 02:00:08,581
For once.

1897
02:00:09,989 --> 02:00:11,590
I woulda killed you.

1898
02:00:18,939 --> 02:00:23,855
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.

1899
02:00:23,972 --> 02:00:25,174
I know.

1900
02:02:18,375 --> 02:02:19,855
That's it.
It's all loaded.

1901
02:02:23,866 --> 02:02:25,462
Do you know
what that really is?

1902
02:02:25,525 --> 02:02:26,440
Yeah.

1903
02:02:26,442 --> 02:02:29,427
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

1904
02:02:29,429 --> 02:02:30,740
No.

1905
02:02:30,742 --> 02:02:33,180
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

1906
02:02:33,425 --> 02:02:35,525
Yeah, what?

1907
02:02:35,527 --> 02:02:36,563
A rebellion.

1908
02:02:37,763 --> 02:02:39,581
You could come with us,
you know.

1909
02:02:39,583 --> 02:02:41,912
We need warriors
and leaders like you.

1910
02:02:48,466 --> 02:02:50,629
Maybe someday
you'll feel different.

1911
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:53,289
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1912
02:03:08,062 --> 02:03:09,248
Don't lose that.

1913
02:03:21,178 --> 02:03:23,140
Very few people
have actually seen

1914
02:03:23,298 --> 02:03:24,650
the StarCave Nebula.

1915
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:26,019
It's breathtaking.

1916
02:03:26,044 --> 02:03:27,530
Not unlike your eyes.

1917
02:03:27,688 --> 02:03:29,760
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

1918
02:03:29,762 --> 02:03:31,981
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

1919
02:03:32,933 --> 02:03:34,185
By the way...

1920
02:03:40,434 --> 02:03:41,863
Han!

1921
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:43,114
You're alive!

1922
02:03:43,116 --> 02:03:44,443
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1923
02:03:44,445 --> 02:03:46,209
I should have Chewie
rip your arms off.

1924
02:03:46,211 --> 02:03:47,740
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1925
02:03:47,742 --> 02:03:48,917
Hey, Han!
We are friends.

1926
02:03:48,919 --> 02:03:50,633
You know that.
We're friends. All right?

1927
02:03:55,833 --> 02:03:57,709
Oh, look at you.

1928
02:03:57,711 --> 02:03:59,602
Thought he was gonna
rip your arms off.

1929
02:03:59,723 --> 02:04:00,681
I knew you were kidding.

1930
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:01,527
No, you didn't.

1931
02:04:01,529 --> 02:04:03,350
- So, where's my cut?
- Your cut?

1932
02:04:04,457 --> 02:04:06,673
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

1933
02:04:06,675 --> 02:04:08,477
All we ended up with
was that.

1934
02:04:09,269 --> 02:04:10,898
Mmm-mmm.

1935
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,423
Figure it's worth
about 10,000,

1936
02:04:12,425 --> 02:04:14,146
maybe enough
for a decent buy-in.

1937
02:04:16,267 --> 02:04:17,703
You want a rematch?

1938
02:04:19,073 --> 02:04:20,341
Why not?

1939
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:26,213
You fold now,

1940
02:04:26,283 --> 02:04:27,158
you walk away with enough

1941
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,255
to get yourself
your own little ship.

1942
02:04:29,871 --> 02:04:31,174
You call,

1943
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:33,975
I'm gonna
clean you out again.

1944
02:04:46,503 --> 02:04:47,829
I don't know,
I'm feeling lucky.

1945
02:04:50,042 --> 02:04:52,638
Ooh.

1946
02:04:52,756 --> 02:04:55,119
You really have it bad
for the <i>Falcon,</i> don't you?

1947
02:04:55,191 --> 02:04:57,822
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.

1948
02:05:07,473 --> 02:05:09,969
You got everything
you need there, pal?

1949
02:05:19,793 --> 02:05:21,261
Not bad.

1950
02:05:21,637 --> 02:05:24,279
Not bad. You know,

1951
02:05:24,281 --> 02:05:28,125
if you'd only had
this little green sylop,

1952
02:05:28,127 --> 02:05:29,624
you would've beaten this.

1953
02:05:35,475 --> 02:05:38,444
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.

1954
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:50,669
Beckett said
he heard about this

1955
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:52,960
very big gangster
putting together a job.

1956
02:05:53,749 --> 02:05:55,917
No, I'm telling ya,

1957
02:05:55,998 --> 02:05:57,286
it's gonna be great.

1958
02:05:57,399 --> 02:05:59,269
When have I ever
steered you wrong?
