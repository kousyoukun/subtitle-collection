1
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,469
Come on.

2
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,247
Come on!

3
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,296
Don't let him get away!

4
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,563
Get inside now!

5
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:00,473
Hurry up! You're late!

6
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:05,377
Proxima's gonna
have your hide.

7
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,220
Get back in the den.

8
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:11,702
Look what I stole!

9
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:13,752
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!

10
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,708
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

11
00:02:15,748 --> 00:02:16,578
Hey, give it back!

12
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:17,752
It belongs to
whoever's holding it!

13
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,677
And that's not you!

14
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:19,912
Lex!

15
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,297
Full Sabacc!

16
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:22,643
Idiot's Array.

17
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:23,692
What? Let me see that!

18
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:24,811
Nope, it's my card.

19
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:25,863
You cheat.

20
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:27,597
Han!

21
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:33,274
You were gone too long!

22
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,783
I knew something
must've gone wrong.

23
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,389
This is nothing.
You should see them.

24
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,465
Look down here!

25
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:39,898
All right, listen.

26
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,267
I was in the middle
of the exchange,

27
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,429
I'm handing over
the coaxium

28
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,272
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed 'em.

29
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:44,909
How?

30
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,084
I ran away, then I
boosted their speeder.

31
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:48,144
What, are we
going somewhere?

32
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:49,952
Yeah, anywhere we want.

33
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,459
You held on to
one of the vials?

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,641
Han's back!

35
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,464
This,
this is worth...

36
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,454
Five, six hundred credits.

37
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,659
That's more than
you said we'd need.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,898
To buy our way out
of the control zone.

39
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,329
And off Corellia.

40
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:08,437
Han, this could work.

41
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:09,563
This is gonna work.

42
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,132
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

43
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:13,468
This is it.

44
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,289
What are we waiting for?

45
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:23,850
There he is.
Hey, you two!

46
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:28,764
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?

47
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:31,051
I was just on my way
to see Lady Proxima.

48
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,131
What a night I had.

49
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,360
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

50
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:41,500
Hold still, scrumrat!

51
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,103
Easy.

52
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:46,264
Come on.

53
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,392
All right.

54
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,647
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

55
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:13,234
Well, what happened?

56
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:14,571
I'll tell you what happened.

57
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,782
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.

58
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,619
The money?

59
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:20,430
- They kept it.
- And my coaxium?

60
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:21,518
They kept that, too.

61
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,522
But we learned
a very valuable lesson.

62
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,162
We cannot trust those guys.

63
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:28,028
So you expect me to believe

64
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:30,664
that you walked away
with nothing!

65
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,952
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

66
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,149
To me, that's a lot.

67
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:39,457
I trusted you
with a simple task,

68
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:42,232
and all I'm hearing
are excuses.

69
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,561
There must be consequences
for disobedience

70
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,424
or else you never learn.

71
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:58,555
You know what?

72
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,940
I don't think
I'm ever gonna learn.

73
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,614
What did you say?

74
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:08,037
I said, next time
somebody hits me,

75
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,477
I hit 'em back.

76
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,577
Moloch, wait!

77
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:15,944
Don't!

78
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,463
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

79
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,337
We pulled you
out of that horror,

80
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:21,879
gave you a home.

81
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,595
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!

82
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:29,086
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

83
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,413
We will make it up to you.

84
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,962
Everybody, stand back!

85
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,745
What's that supposed to be?

86
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,428
This is a thermal detonator

87
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,963
that I just armed.

88
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,665
- That's a rock!
- No, it's not.

89
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:46,528
Yes, it is!

90
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:47,427
And you just made

91
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,190
a clicking sound
with your mouth.

92
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,954
Please tell me
this isn't your plan.

93
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,332
No, this is.

94
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,095
- Get in!
- An M-68?

95
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:05,935
- Nice, right?
- I love it!

96
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,188
Whoa!

97
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,746
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

98
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,021
we're gonna be on it.

99
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:46,701
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.

100
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:49,749
I'm gonna be a pilot.

101
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,217
We can get our own ship.

102
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,135
See the galaxy,
all of it.

103
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,951
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

104
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,371
Ever.

105
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:04,920
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.

106
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,063
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

107
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,391
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

108
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,517
<i>You must have
proper clearance.</i>

109
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,300
<i>Stop at once! You must
follow the proper...</i>

110
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:41,444
<i>Protocol.</i>

111
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,125
Damn!
That stinger's fast.

112
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,594
Yeah, but we're faster,
right?

113
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,074
I hope so.

114
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,558
<i>Pull over!</i>

115
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,026
Han, no,
we're not gonna make it!

116
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,800
Oh, yeah?

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,568
Han, I'm telling you,
it's too tight!

118
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,073
Watch this.

119
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:14,034
Come on!

120
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,332
We gotta move.

121
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,271
<i>Do not join the line</i>

122
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,069
<i>if you don't have
a boarding pass.</i>

123
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,667
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

124
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,917
<i>All droids
must be registered.</i>

125
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:42,036
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

126
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,579
<i>Stand down. Do not resist!</i>

127
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,305
<i>- Stop struggling.
- Let me go!</i>

128
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:50,274
<i>Take his arm.</i>

129
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:51,041
<i>I got him.</i>

130
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:53,212
<i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

131
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:54,053
<i>This way, come on.</i>

132
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,060
<i>Keep moving.
Hold it, hold it.</i>

133
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:00,539
Next.

134
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,521
Han, they're here.

135
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,195
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

136
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,261
We're almost there.

137
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,265
- Just hold on to me.
- Next.

138
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:16,340
Don't look back.

139
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,888
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,

140
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,398
figure out
where we're going.

141
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,414
Anywhere the Empire isn't.
Wherever we go,

142
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,926
it can't be worse
than where we've been.

143
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:28,459
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

144
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:30,628
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,

145
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:33,196
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.

146
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,354
That's not gonna happen.

147
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,604
I won't let it.

148
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:44,948
For luck?

149
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,644
Damn right.

150
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,748
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

151
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:53,979
Next.

152
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,320
ID chips.

153
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,455
Funny thing,
we don't have 'em.

154
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:01,817
We have this.

155
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:03,340
Refined hyperfuel.

156
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,300
It's worth at least
800 credits, maybe more.

157
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,970
You could be detained
just for having that.

158
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,801
What good would
that do anybody?

159
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,871
Let us through,
it's all yours.

160
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:25,480
The coaxium, now.

161
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,101
As we're going through,
not before.

162
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,634
Do it.

163
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:36,809
Just do it, do it.

164
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:43,370
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!

165
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,029
Wait!
Open the door!

166
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,601
Security! Security,
there has been a breach!

167
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,036
Open the door!

168
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,571
- Run! Run!
- Get your hands off of her!

169
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,845
Run!

170
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:54,678
Get your hands off of her!

171
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,510
Qi'ra!

172
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,879
Run, Han! Go!

173
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,313
Keep moving.

174
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,683
Qi'ra!

175
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,651
Run!

176
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,076
<i>Traveler
has been apprehended.</i>

177
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:09,394
Qi'ra, I'll come back!
I'll come back!

178
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,990
<i>All units,
there has been a breach.</i>

179
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,932
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>

180
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,430
One got through
the gate! Look over there!

181
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,599
<i>Someone
got through the checkpoint.</i>

182
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:31,633
Keep an eye on that gate.
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,045
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

184
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,620
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

185
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,136
Hey, wait!

186
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:38,768
<i>- Hey!
- Come with us.</i>

187
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,952
<i>He's still
out there. Keep looking.</i>

188
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,717
<i>You there, stop!</i>

189
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,368
<i>- Show me some identification.
- Please. Please. No, no!</i>

190
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:00,598
<i>Do not resist.</i>
http://worldmkv.com/

191
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:04,020
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

192
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:08,579
<i>Explore new worlds.
Learn valuable skills.</i>

193
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:12,407
<i>Bring order and unity
to the galaxy!</i>

194
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:15,780
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

195
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:19,006
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?

196
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,590
If you apply
for the Imperial Navy,

197
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,424
but most recruits
go into the infantry.

198
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:25,580
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Best in the galaxy.

199
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,382
You there,
come with us.

200
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:28,485
Who, me?

201
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,370
We have a few questions
to ask you.

202
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,159
How long
is that gonna take?

203
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:34,638
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

204
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,073
Why, have you got
somewhere to be?

205
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:38,269
Yeah, back here,
as soon as I can.

206
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:42,723
Don't hear that much.
What's your name, son?

207
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:43,806
Han.

208
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,556
Han what?

209
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,519
Who are your people?

210
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:55,071
I don't have people.
I'm alone.

211
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:57,272
Han...

212
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:01,406
Solo.

213
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,460
Approved.

214
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,290
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

215
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,810
Good luck, Han Solo.

216
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:12,429
We'll have you flying
in no time.

217
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,512
Your Empire needs you.
Troopers forward!

218
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,611
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!

219
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:34,130
Almost where?
Where are we going?

220
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:37,081
Just over that last ridge.
Victory is...

221
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:50,627
My legs! My leg!

222
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:08,027
<i>Hey, Beckett,
you said we were here</i>

223
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,384
<i>to pull a quick job.</i>

224
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,360
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, this ain't a quick job!</i>

225
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,807
<i>It's a war!</i>

226
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:15,362
It's always
something with you.

227
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,912
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.

228
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,329
Forward operations
must be this way.

229
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,998
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

230
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,013
Yeah, go that way and die!

231
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,614
That's exactly what happened
to the major!

232
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,956
Who's the ranking
officer now?

233
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,685
You are, Captain.

234
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,134
<i>He's got you there.</i>

235
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,507
So what's the plan,
Captain Beckett?

236
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,858
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

237
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,449
I'll take this
mouthy scooch

238
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,704
and we'll go around
to the right

239
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:49,934
and maybe
we'll get lucky.

240
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:51,650
<i>Luck's got
nothin' to do with it.</i>

241
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,681
Wait! One question!

242
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,963
- You wanna live, sparky?
- Very much.

243
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,489
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

244
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,779
Let's go!

245
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:16,816
Captain.

246
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,167
<i>T-15s are down.
We walk from here.</i>

247
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,326
Captain.

248
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,606
I'm Han.

249
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,297
Nobody cares.

250
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,841
Thanks for your help
back there.

251
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:31,139
You did all right.

252
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,776
I was trained
in aerial combat...

253
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:35,725
You want some advice?

254
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:36,992
Get the hell
away from here.

255
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:39,568
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.

256
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:43,885
What company
do you command?

257
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,659
None of your business
company.

258
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,566
And we're full up.

259
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,958
<i>Stick
to soldiering, kid.</i>

260
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:51,439
<i>You don't want
any part of this.</i>

261
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,278
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

262
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:02,847
Attention!

263
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:06,148
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

264
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,806
I want an advance party
of ten men.

265
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,687
Great, more mud.

266
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,886
What was that?

267
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,735
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

268
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,596
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,

269
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,588
install a regime
loyal to the Emperor,

270
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,633
and eradicate
the hostiles.

271
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:24,929
It's their planet,
we're the hostiles.

272
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,181
You got a problem, trooper?

273
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,737
No problem, sir.

274
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:33,715
Moving out.

275
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,612
To the southern
marshlands! Move out!

276
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:38,671
You heard 'em!
Let's move out!

277
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,904
Mmm. Looks like
they're running sorties

278
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,531
every 30 minutes.

279
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,041
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,

280
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,396
signalman, pilot.

281
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:55,885
Hell, I'll just
take 'em all out.

282
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,313
What are we
looking at?

283
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:02,891
You have a talent for
sticking your nose in

284
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,338
where it doesn't belong.

285
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:05,940
I just couldn't help
but notice

286
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,250
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

287
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,801
So either
you heal real quick

288
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,988
or you stole it off
a dead man.

289
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:15,163
You're not Imperial Army.

290
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,670
You're thieves here
to steal equipment

291
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,537
for a job and I want in.

292
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:20,965
- Well, now we gotta shoot him.
- No.

293
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,066
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.

294
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,480
Or you take me with you.

295
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,232
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

296
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,736
I was boosting AV-21s
when I was ten.

297
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,616
I'm a driver, a flyer,

298
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,106
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

299
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:38,674
<i>What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?</i>

300
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,941
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy

301
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:43,534
for having
a mind of my own.

302
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:47,053
But I am a great pilot.
And I gotta get home.

303
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:49,692
<i>This guy is nuts. No one
goes back to Corellia.</i>

304
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,188
I got a reason.

305
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:53,352
We've already
got a great pilot.

306
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,981
The Ardennian.

307
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:58,153
<i>Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>

308
00:18:58,223 --> 00:18:59,616
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

309
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,859
Oh, really?
A couple of your arms

310
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:01,712
popped out of your butt

311
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:03,482
and hiked up your pants,
trooper.

312
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:04,281
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

313
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:06,724
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

314
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:07,984
I've already been away
too long.

315
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,943
Just give me a shot.

316
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,687
<i>Whoa. Hold it.</i>

317
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,173
Well, if you're
not interested in me,

318
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:18,209
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

319
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,283
Blackmail.

320
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,687
Lieutenant.

321
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:27,709
Captain.

322
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:31,266
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.

323
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,214
Take him.

324
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,045
Wait.

325
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:36,053
I should've known.
This one's a troublemaker.

326
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,286
And a liar. Don't
believe anything he says.

327
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:40,423
<i>- Don't go anywhere without me.
- All right, let's go.</i>

328
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:41,702
Feed him to the beast.

329
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,428
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?

330
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:44,677
<i>- Hold on!
- Move it!</i>

331
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,933
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

332
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:48,231
<i>- He was lying!
- Quiet!</i>

333
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:51,103
<i>Don't care.</i>

334
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,746
<i>Haven't fed him
in three days.</i>

335
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:56,984
<i>Should be fun.</i>

336
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,982
Oh! Hey!
Hey, big fella.

337
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,730
Just calm down.
Take it easy.

338
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,324
We're on the same side.

339
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,078
You like treats?

340
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:56,128
Help!
Let me out of here!

341
00:20:56,168 --> 00:20:57,337
Let me out of here!

342
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,477
A-ha! Gotcha!

343
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:09,888
Ahhh!

344
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,171
<i>Ah, this was
just getting good.</i>

345
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:26,558
<i>- He killed him too fast.
- Yeah!</i>

346
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:27,898
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

347
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,139
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

348
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,741
Wait! Wait!

349
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:39,583
Yeah, I speak a little.

350
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:42,541
Now just listen to me, you...

351
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:02,916
Yes, yes!

352
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:04,825
No, no, no, no!

353
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:08,658
Do it!

354
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,944
Come on.

355
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,314
Oh, no!

356
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:15,494
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.</i>

357
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:17,394
Let me out of here!

358
00:22:17,513 --> 00:22:19,190
I can't take it anymore!

359
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,433
<i>- Oh, no! Stop, please!
- That's it. Get him!</i>

360
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:27,189
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?

361
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:40,945
See what happens
when you listen to me?

362
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,931
Hey, what are you doing?

363
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:46,975
Ow.

364
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,149
Follow me!

365
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:03,452
Wait, wait.

366
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:05,386
Come here.
Listen to me.

367
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,384
You don't understand,
okay?

368
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:07,325
I have some
very good friends

369
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:08,469
waiting for me
at that airfield.

370
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:09,906
They're leaving
right now.

371
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:11,625
That's our one way
off this mud ball.

372
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:13,300
If you wanna live,
we go that way.

373
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,812
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

374
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,960
But right now,
that's the way you go!

375
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:21,723
Trust me!

376
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:24,685
Val, let's go!

377
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,922
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!

378
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,877
No wonder
they're such lousy pilots.

379
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,593
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,

380
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,022
you can't hear each other!

381
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,465
I'll be damned.

382
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,969
Hey, look who's back!

383
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,283
Unbelievable!

384
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:49,095
Wait!

385
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,992
Wait!

386
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,665
Whoa, is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!

387
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:55,029
I'll say it, I don't care.

388
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:56,603
This kid's growing on me.

389
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,576
Wait!

390
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,228
You know, we could always use

391
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:05,283
some muscle
on a job like this.

392
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:07,302
Don't even
think about it!

393
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:09,736
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

394
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:11,501
than curled up
in a Wookiee's lap.

395
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:20,118
I told you!

396
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,245
Very good friends!

397
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,873
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

398
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:19,778
Thanks for helping me
get outta there.

399
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,067
No, they only took you
because of me.

400
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,389
Hey!

401
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,140
I got us
a real sweet deal here.

402
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,194
We do this one job
with them,

403
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:37,098
we make some real money,

404
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:39,300
and then we're free.

405
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,451
When's the last time
you could say that?

406
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:47,158
Been a while
for me, too.

407
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,882
So what's your name,
anyway?

408
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:56,651
Chewbacca?

409
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:59,035
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

410
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:00,849
'cause I ain't saying that
every time.

411
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,110
Here it comes.
Take a look.

412
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,792
Yeah.

413
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:12,727
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

414
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:15,968
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

415
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,598
cable it up to the AT-hauler
and then...

416
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,492
Rio jams
their distress signal.

417
00:26:21,174 --> 00:26:22,274
I blow the bridge,

418
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,207
the container slides
right off the track

419
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:25,661
and we sail away.

420
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:27,464
You trip that security beam,

421
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,627
wake up those Vipers,

422
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:31,089
it's liable to get
real spicy, real fast.

423
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:33,271
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

424
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:34,771
Enfys Nest.

425
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:36,229
What's an Enfys Nest?

426
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:37,400
I told you,
we're way ahead

427
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,223
of the competition
on this one.

428
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,481
There's no way Enfys Nest

429
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,583
even knows
about this shipment.

430
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,346
Only my guy
has the intel.

431
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,875
Well, you better
be right. Yeah?

432
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,088
Because sometimes,
you put your faith

433
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:50,512
in the wrong people.

434
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:55,237
<i>Our whole future
depends on this one score</i>

435
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,595
<i>and you bring in amateurs.</i>

436
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,877
<i>In case you hadn't noticed,</i>

437
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,559
<i>we're a little shorthanded.</i>

438
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:01,083
So we get who we need.

439
00:27:01,154 --> 00:27:03,611
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

440
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,941
But, no, instead you're
putting our lives

441
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:07,557
in the hands of morons.

442
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,928
You guys morons?

443
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:10,819
No!

444
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,005
- No. See?
- We're not morons.

445
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:16,019
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

446
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:17,865
I'm not about to screw it up,
all right?

447
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:19,824
Oh, come on, Val!

448
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:21,501
He looks so sincere.

449
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:22,911
Plus, have you ever
tried to disinvite

450
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,047
a Wookiee to anything?

451
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:26,617
Not a good idea!

452
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:28,007
This is not funny!

453
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:32,536
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

454
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,448
And, besides,
do you see any other options?

455
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,836
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

456
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.

457
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:42,532
We're gonna
clear our debts,

458
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:44,485
go back to Glee Anselm,

459
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:48,204
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

460
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,416
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

461
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:52,284
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.

462
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:58,216
So what's your sob story,
flyboy?

463
00:27:58,256 --> 00:27:59,130
Who, me?

464
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,166
You're after something,
I know the look.

465
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:02,862
What is it?
Revenge?

466
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:05,333
No, it's not revenge.

467
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,927
Look at him.

468
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,614
If it's anything,
it's a girl.

469
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:09,635
Oh, a girl!

470
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:12,241
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?

471
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,500
Does she have sharp teeth?

472
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,982
There was a girl.

473
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,619
But I got out,
she didn't.

474
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,337
I swore to myself
I'd become a pilot,

475
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,424
get a ship,

476
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:30,811
go back and find her.

477
00:28:31,948 --> 00:28:35,706
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.

478
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:37,812
How you know
she'll still be there?

479
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,335
I just know.

480
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:41,753
Personally, I refuse
to be tied down

481
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,954
by anyone,
though many have tried.

482
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:46,824
Come on, Rio.
You don't fool me.

483
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:48,677
Everybody needs somebody.

484
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:53,191
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.

485
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:05,902
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?

486
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:20,147
What was he saying?

487
00:29:20,187 --> 00:29:21,591
He said the Wookiees
were enslaved

488
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:24,164
by the Empire,
taken off Kashyyyk.

489
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:26,179
He's searching
for his, uh...

490
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,626
I don't know if he said
tribe or family.

491
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:32,274
What's the difference?

492
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,897
Show me how to do that.

493
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,306
The only thing
you need to learn to do

494
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:44,629
is do what I say
when I say it.

495
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:46,715
And this time tomorrow,

496
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:47,990
you'll have
more than enough

497
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,432
to buy your own ship.

498
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:12,679
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

499
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:15,420
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.

500
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,864
<i>Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.</i>

501
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:30,463
I'm fine!

502
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:36,447
Val, how's it going
up there?

503
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:41,757
Never better.

504
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,320
Coaxium.

505
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:08,644
Enough to power a fleet!

506
00:31:08,684 --> 00:31:11,190
Or blow us all
straight to hell!

507
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,152
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

508
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,601
Is it a good day?

509
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:18,407
<i>It's a great day!</i>

510
00:31:18,447 --> 00:31:21,010
Best day of your life,
my grabby friend!

511
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,207
I don't know,
you've never been

512
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,036
to a Mynock roast
on Ardennia.

513
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,178
It's nuts!

514
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,994
Here they come!

515
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,783
Get down to the couplers!

516
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:32,384
Rio, fall back!

517
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,761
Well, that didn't
take 'em long.

518
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,039
Chewie!

519
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:11,136
You all right?

520
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,977
Little close there,
buddy!

521
00:32:17,397 --> 00:32:19,108
Han, what's the holdup?

522
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,228
All right, together.

523
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,046
Now!

524
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,038
All right!

525
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:33,832
Oh!

526
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:40,380
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?

527
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:42,284
<i>Just up here
planning my retirement.</i>

528
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:43,572
Thinking about opening
a cantina

529
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:45,944
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?

530
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:48,355
Lowering
the winch cables now!

531
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:07,148
I knew it! I told him!
Beckett!

532
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:08,390
<i>He's coming!</i>

533
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:12,433
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

534
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,409
Who's that?

535
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,003
Enfys Nest!

536
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:21,796
Marauders, pirates.

537
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,628
Come to snake the score
from under us.

538
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:26,391
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

539
00:33:26,393 --> 00:33:27,394
<i>Move in.</i>

540
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:10,291
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.

541
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:13,735
Get off of my ship!

542
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,802
You still with us, brother?

543
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,759
Yeah, I'm okay.

544
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,819
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.

545
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,594
He's not okay.

546
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:34,215
Chewie!

547
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,583
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!

548
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,356
Han!

549
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:44,673
I'm on it!

550
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,375
Val!

551
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:58,367
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>

552
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:05,415
Viper droids
headed your way!

553
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:08,585
Rio?

554
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:10,800
Yeah, it looks worse
than it is.

555
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:13,552
Just gotta patch it up.

556
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:15,960
Maybe rest my eyes
for a minute.

557
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:38,131
<i>Enough!
I'm going in.</i>

558
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:04,836
You weren't lying, kid.

559
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,872
You're a hell of a pilot.

560
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:09,267
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

561
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:24,209
Beckett,
we just lost a cable!

562
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:27,195
<i>2.1 to the bridge!</i>

563
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:32,932
It's no good
to die alone, kid.

564
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:35,938
Val was right.

565
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,703
Rio?

566
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,199
Beckett, we're .8
from the bridge!

567
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,402
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

568
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:16,640
Val, you gotta
get off that bridge!

569
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:17,543
We're here!

570
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,745
They got me pinned!

571
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,966
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

572
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:27,608
What?

573
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:29,287
It's been a ride, babe.

574
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:32,859
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

575
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,585
<i>Val!</i>

576
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:35,856
No!

577
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,735
No!

578
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,192
Chewie, now!

579
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:23,739
<i>Beckett, I can't
pull it away from 'em.</i>

580
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,877
They'll let go,
you fly straight!

581
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:30,744
<i>Release your cables</i>

582
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,220
<i>or die!</i>

583
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:34,207
We're too close.

584
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,337
I gotta release.

585
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:36,813
You do what
I tell you, Han!

586
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,266
Chewie, grab the line!

587
00:38:38,356 --> 00:38:39,697
Don't you do it!

588
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:44,189
Han!

589
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:45,795
<i>You coward!</i>

590
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:35,895
What the hell?

591
00:39:36,186 --> 00:39:39,627
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!

592
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,095
You have any idea
what you've done?

593
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,999
We were not stealing
for ourselves,

594
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:47,615
we were hired
by Crimson Dawn.

595
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:52,238
Crimson Dawn?

596
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,597
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.

597
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,795
When they find out
we don't got it,

598
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:58,865
they're gonna kill us.

599
00:39:59,932 --> 00:40:01,560
Right.

600
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:02,985
We run.

601
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:05,895
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?

602
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,235
The difference

603
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:08,894
is the Empire
doesn't send out

604
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:11,230
a team of enforcers
to hunt you down

605
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:12,752
when you're a deserter.

606
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:14,264
Dryden Vos will.

607
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:17,359
You have any idea
what it's like

608
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,298
to live with a price
on your head?

609
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:23,547
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

610
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:26,004
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

611
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,002
Then that's what we do.

612
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,009
No.

613
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:44,511
He knows me,
not you.

614
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,855
If you come with me

615
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:50,799
and show your face,

616
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,635
if they don't kill you,

617
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:56,293
you're in this life for good.

618
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:01,383
You find some way
to square this,

619
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,163
we still get our money?

620
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:08,371
Maybe.

621
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:13,189
For me,
it's worth the risk.

622
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:16,851
How about you?

623
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:25,693
That's yes.

624
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:30,803
Sorry I punched your face.

625
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,191
Happens more often
than you think.

626
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,212
So when we get up there,

627
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:38,491
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?

628
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:41,650
Nearby,
on his yacht.

629
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,710
You're gonna know
how to find it?

630
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,359
That won't be
a problem.

631
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:29,309
I'll need to
check your weapons.

632
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,155
That's all I got left.

633
00:43:12,663 --> 00:43:15,555
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.

634
00:43:15,662 --> 00:43:16,985
He'll be with you
shortly.

635
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:19,150
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

636
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:25,667
Excuse me, sir.

637
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,731
Yes.

638
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,707
- Beckett has arrived.
- Oh.

639
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,409
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

640
00:43:41,864 --> 00:43:44,393
I get all worked up.
Silly.

641
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:45,968
It's a party.

642
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,596
Hey.

643
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:53,756
These people are
not your friends

644
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,513
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.

645
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:57,714
Don't look at anybody,

646
00:43:57,716 --> 00:43:59,543
just keep your eyes down.

647
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:04,890
I might get a drink.

648
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:19,151
No, yeah, whatever.

649
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:39,975
Chewie, would you please...

650
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:50,852
Qi'ra, what are you
doing here?

651
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,216
I work here.

652
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:54,252
What's your excuse?

653
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:55,583
My... I...

654
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:57,255
Qi'ra, I was...

655
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:01,963
I was coming back
for you.

656
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,488
It's in the past, Han.

657
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,115
Not for me.

658
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:06,081
The only reason I'm here,

659
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,685
I was doing this job,
get a little money

660
00:45:07,736 --> 00:45:10,426
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

661
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:12,571
Well, now you don't have to.

662
00:45:13,602 --> 00:45:15,570
I'm right in front of you.

663
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:19,079
That day...

664
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,829
Sometimes,
a lot of times, I think...

665
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:22,132
If you'd have stayed,

666
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:25,414
they would've killed you.

667
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm glad you got out.

668
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,581
How did you get out?

669
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:40,213
I didn't.

670
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:45,169
You look good.

671
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:46,951
A little rough
around the edges,

672
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:48,350
but good.

673
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:49,996
You too.

674
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:51,931
Thank you, Ottilie.

675
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:54,563
Have you been attentive
to Dok-Ondar?

676
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:55,633
Very.

677
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:01,110
What should we drink to?

678
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:04,358
Let's drink two
and see where it goes.

679
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,052
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

680
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:17,238
Yeah.
Sort of.

681
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,590
About to.
That's why I'm here.

682
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:21,966
I'm working on a...

683
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:23,925
Very big deal.

684
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:25,079
How big?

685
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:26,279
Enormous.

686
00:46:26,334 --> 00:46:29,864
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

687
00:46:29,979 --> 00:46:31,547
Any minute.

688
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:35,229
I thought
about you a lot.

689
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,505
Off somewhere,
some adventure.

690
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,636
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

691
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:46,367
- What?
- Hey.

692
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:48,489
What did I say?

693
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:50,582
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

694
00:46:50,662 --> 00:46:52,058
I'm gonna
bump into something.

695
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,397
But I told you
not to talk to anyone.

696
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:54,465
Beckett.

697
00:46:55,352 --> 00:46:58,222
Wait.
You two work together?

698
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,596
- Yeah.
- Tobias!

699
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:04,235
Dryden.

700
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:06,291
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

701
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:08,161
No, I'm fine.

702
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:10,880
I'm sorry
to hear about Val.

703
00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:12,336
Yeah,
I appreciate that.

704
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,680
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

705
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:16,242
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

706
00:47:16,244 --> 00:47:19,293
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.

707
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,889
They're with me.

708
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:22,619
I'm Dryden Vos.

709
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,481
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.

710
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:31,096
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.

711
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,189
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

712
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:37,619
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

713
00:47:37,752 --> 00:47:40,535
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

714
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:42,599
The stench, am I right?

715
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:45,237
Well, it's good
to have you.

716
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:47,147
Welcome.

717
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:49,529
And you, too, Chewbacca,
welcome.

718
00:47:50,192 --> 00:47:54,228
All right, let's eat a
little, drink a lot,

719
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,573
and talk privately.

720
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:00,177
We're just friends,
all right?

721
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:02,105
You're touchy.

722
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:06,665
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

723
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:08,796
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.

724
00:48:08,855 --> 00:48:09,780
You're sorry?

725
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,280
Dryden, there were
complications.

726
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:12,071
There were factors.

727
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:15,493
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

728
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:17,101
It's one you should've
anticipated,

729
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,664
it's one you should've
dealt with.

730
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,152
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,

731
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:23,143
but when you hired me,
you told me

732
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:24,143
no one else
had this information...

733
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:25,534
Test me!

734
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:29,502
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

735
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,961
I think what Dryden
is trying to say

736
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:34,894
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

737
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:36,955
No, I'm not interested.

738
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:38,765
I'm not interested
at all.

739
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:40,026
Dryden,

740
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:42,002
what can I do
to make this right?

741
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:43,910
"Make this right?"

742
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:46,377
There is no
making this right.

743
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:47,907
You know who I answer to

744
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,262
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

745
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,400
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."

746
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:56,126
So here's what I need you
to do for me.

747
00:48:56,254 --> 00:48:59,788
I need you to give me
a reason

748
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,894
not to kill you all.

749
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,854
Because I will
make it up to you.

750
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:06,133
No, no, no. How?

751
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:07,419
How will you
make it up to me?

752
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:10,820
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

753
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:14,486
100 k-grams of
refined coaxium?

754
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:17,922
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

755
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:19,353
From where?

756
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:20,563
You'll be hard pushed
to find that

757
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:22,239
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

758
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:24,236
Scarif.
Maybe Mercy Island.

759
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:25,572
That's impossible.

760
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:28,270
So, let's come up
with some other options.

761
00:49:28,337 --> 00:49:29,632
Other ideas
that we might...

762
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,537
What about unrefined?

763
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:37,743
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

764
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:40,738
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

765
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,973
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

766
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:44,605
That's a very,
very good one.

767
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:46,897
But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

768
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,972
Crimson Dawn maintains

769
00:49:48,014 --> 00:49:50,309
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

770
00:49:50,398 --> 00:49:52,674
It's one that
I can't jeopardize

771
00:49:52,676 --> 00:49:54,804
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

772
00:49:54,806 --> 00:49:57,983
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

773
00:49:58,172 --> 00:50:01,778
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

774
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,640
Not all we have.

775
00:50:02,642 --> 00:50:05,672
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

776
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:08,142
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

777
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:19,128
Possible?

778
00:50:19,593 --> 00:50:20,855
It's risky.

779
00:50:20,857 --> 00:50:23,554
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

780
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:25,209
it starts to destabilize,

781
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:26,844
so unless...

782
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:28,375
Unless...

783
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:29,973
Unless...

784
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:31,727
Work with me here.

785
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,515
Unless you could
find somewhere

786
00:50:33,517 --> 00:50:35,217
to get it processed fast.

787
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:36,501
- Uh...
- Uh...

788
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:38,709
Well...

789
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:41,062
He's saying Savareen?

790
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:42,413
Savareen.

791
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:44,320
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

792
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:46,503
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.

793
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:48,246
But Qi'ra's right.

794
00:50:48,308 --> 00:50:51,738
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

795
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,120
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship

796
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,829
and a brilliant pilot.

797
00:50:55,943 --> 00:50:57,477
We'll find a ship.

798
00:50:57,479 --> 00:50:59,189
We've already
got the pilot.

799
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:07,637
He is arrogant
and he's hungry.

800
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:08,623
So what do you think,
my dear?

801
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:13,423
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

802
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:21,914
Yes, I believe he can.

803
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:24,816
Well, that is good news,

804
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:26,813
because you're going with him

805
00:51:27,108 --> 00:51:29,379
to see that he does.

806
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:32,596
All right?

807
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:34,824
Of course.

808
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,003
All right.

809
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:39,714
I'll see you all
on Savareen.

810
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:40,842
Savareen it is.

811
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:42,685
- I feel great about this plan.
- Me, too.

812
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:44,412
We should do this again.
It's been fun.

813
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:45,461
Great.

814
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:47,125
Oh, just one more thing.

815
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:49,462
If you do fail me again,

816
00:51:51,104 --> 00:51:52,649
we'll all be out of options.

817
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:54,323
Right?

818
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:55,392
We won't.

819
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:01,243
So, I thought
that went really well.

820
00:52:01,295 --> 00:52:03,535
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

821
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,422
What do you need?

822
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:06,182
I can scrounge up
the gear.

823
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:07,696
Do you got a line
on a ship?

824
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:08,935
I know a guy.

825
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:12,655
And I know
just where to find him.

826
00:52:12,657 --> 00:52:14,715
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

827
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,084
He's the best
smuggler around.

828
00:52:16,086 --> 00:52:17,238
He's slipped through
the Empire's fingers

829
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,369
more times than anyone else.

830
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:22,184
He's attractive, too.

831
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:23,148
Sophisticated,

832
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,952
with impeccable taste
and... Charisma.

833
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:31,050
Not to mention
his prodigious...

834
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,132
We get it.

835
00:52:36,744 --> 00:52:39,898
But he's retired.
Says he's a sportsman now.

836
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,660
All we need is his ship.

837
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:43,486
Well, he'll never
part with it.

838
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:44,668
He loves that ship.

839
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,137
He won it

840
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,814
playing Sabacc.

841
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:49,094
And there's the rub, right?

842
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:51,208
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

843
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,405
I thought she loved me.

844
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,938
That's the guy, huh?

845
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,301
Hmm.

846
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,496
An interesting style.

847
00:52:58,771 --> 00:52:59,773
I'll say.

848
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:01,694
You say he won his ship?

849
00:53:01,696 --> 00:53:03,811
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

850
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,450
I can take him.
Let me at him.

851
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:06,914
Absolutely not.

852
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,977
Han, these guys
are serious gamblers.

853
00:53:09,038 --> 00:53:11,134
I'm serious. Stake me.

854
00:53:11,136 --> 00:53:13,541
Don't listen to him.

855
00:53:19,924 --> 00:53:21,999
Thank you. Thank you.

856
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:23,770
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

857
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:24,773
Come on.

858
00:53:26,092 --> 00:53:28,208
There's no liars in this game,
just players.

859
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:29,800
Is this seat taken?

860
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:35,227
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.

861
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:40,786
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

862
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:41,940
Sabacc.

863
00:53:41,942 --> 00:53:44,573
Sabacc. Got it.

864
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:45,821
You play it before?

865
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:47,594
A couple times, yeah.

866
00:53:49,107 --> 00:53:50,564
Captain Lando Calrissian.

867
00:53:50,597 --> 00:53:52,415
Han Solo.

868
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:54,345
Looks like you're
having a good day.

869
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,624
I'm a lucky guy.

870
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,414
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?

871
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,969
Anything, Han.

872
00:54:01,257 --> 00:54:04,638
That's "Han",
but that's okay.

873
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,277
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

874
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:13,033
Everything you've heard
about me is true.

875
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,160
Thanks, love.

876
00:54:14,162 --> 00:54:16,490
Did you win your ship
playing cards?

877
00:54:16,492 --> 00:54:18,076
Oh, I've won
a lot of things.

878
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:22,731
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

879
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,936
Wow.

880
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:26,064
Turned out to be
a real money pit.

881
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:26,794
I'm impressed.

882
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,096
I don't think I'd have
the nerve to gamble

883
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,392
with something
I love as much as my ship.

884
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:31,998
- Really?
- Yeah.

885
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:33,463
What do you fly?

886
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:35,971
VCX-100.

887
00:54:37,492 --> 00:54:39,396
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?

888
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,253
It's the fastest
in the galaxy,

889
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:42,684
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.

890
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:45,089
I mean, I'm sure
yours is very nice.

891
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:47,112
Gets me where I'm goin'.

892
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:52,739
Beginner's luck.

893
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,632
Well played.

894
00:55:01,762 --> 00:55:03,758
Let's see what
we got here.

895
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,553
Oh, great hand!

896
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:12,246
Sorry, guys.
Close, but not quite.

897
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:24,028
Eyes on
your own cards, buddy.

898
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,195
All of 'em.

899
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,121
There.
Well, now I see yours.

900
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,559
Oh, that's me?
Okay, let's see...

901
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:42,088
Sorry, minus two.

902
00:55:46,804 --> 00:55:48,709
This game is fun.

903
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,724
All right,
how about this?

904
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:53,388
I'll see your bet
and I'll raise you.

905
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,987
2,000.

906
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,297
I'll see your 2,000

907
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,821
and I'll raise you

908
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:06,960
however much this is.

909
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,418
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

910
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,009
Slow down.

911
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,718
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.

912
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,793
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.

913
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:20,568
I like this kid.

914
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,735
You're adorable.

915
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:23,136
And I'm serious.

916
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:24,567
And I'm calling.

917
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,642
With what?

918
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:27,676
Your scarf?

919
00:56:27,835 --> 00:56:28,912
Not my style.

920
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,119
My ship.

921
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:32,866
Against your ship.

922
00:56:34,814 --> 00:56:36,649
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.

923
00:56:39,705 --> 00:56:40,973
What the hell?

924
00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:46,254
Straight Staves.

925
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:58,452
You played me.
You're good.

926
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,124
- Yeah.
- You're very good.

927
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,482
But not good enough.

928
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:03,668
Full Sabacc.

929
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,006
I told you to quit
while you were ahead.

930
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:16,097
Drinks on me!

931
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:21,702
Yeah, that's right.

932
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:30,203
First of all,
there's no way

933
00:57:30,205 --> 00:57:31,784
he could've had
that green sylop.

934
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:32,790
They'd all been played.

935
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:34,520
Also, your guy,
Captain Wonderful,

936
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:35,966
is so full of bantha crap...

937
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:37,703
Yoo-hoo!

938
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:41,554
Where's my VCX?

939
00:57:41,964 --> 00:57:43,579
I don't have it
right here now.

940
00:57:43,581 --> 00:57:45,032
It's in the shop.

941
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:46,818
- I'm getting some work done.
- Lando.

942
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:50,077
Qi'ra.

943
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:54,293
You look phenomenal.
As always.

944
00:57:54,426 --> 00:57:56,294
Well, I knew I was
gonna see you.

945
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:57,906
Get off!

946
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,334
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?

947
00:57:59,336 --> 00:58:01,800
- There's no need, none.
- They work for me.

948
00:58:01,898 --> 00:58:03,065
Good help
is hard to find, no?

949
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:04,402
We're more like partners.

950
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:07,006
We are.

951
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,233
Excuse us.

952
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:10,481
Listen, last I checked,

953
00:58:10,483 --> 00:58:12,180
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.

954
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:13,947
Dryden said
all is forgiven

955
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:16,156
after I did the whole
Felucia thing for him.

956
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:18,961
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.

957
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:21,942
We need a ship.

958
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:23,269
Why didn't you
just say so?

959
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:24,514
I thought
you were retired.

960
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,874
Circumstances change.

961
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,861
How much?

962
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:31,353
The Kessel Run.

963
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,191
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.

964
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:35,643
Ridiculous.

965
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,817
Grown-ups are talking.

966
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,283
25%.

967
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:45,816
You're Tobias Beckett.

968
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,080
You killed Aurra Sing.

969
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:51,708
Pushed her. Pretty sure
the fall killed her.

970
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,672
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.

971
00:58:54,674 --> 00:58:55,702
I owed her
a lot of money.

972
00:58:55,704 --> 00:58:57,799
And as token
of my gratitude,

973
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,450
I'm willing
to do this for 40%.

974
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:05,158
25.

975
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,272
25% works.

976
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,784
No! Unacceptable!

977
00:59:14,942 --> 00:59:16,913
Stop exploiting droids!

978
00:59:16,983 --> 00:59:19,134
You sloppy degenerate bios!

979
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:20,810
- She never learns.
- Have you no shame?

980
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:21,886
Who?

981
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:22,603
My first mate.

982
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:25,148
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!

983
00:59:25,188 --> 00:59:28,066
How can you condone
this savagery?

984
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,859
You, you. You should
not be doing this.

985
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:33,499
They're using you
for entertainment.

986
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,364
Yeah. You've
been neurowashed.

987
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:37,589
Don't just blindly
follow the program.

988
00:59:37,591 --> 00:59:39,610
Exercise some free will!

989
00:59:40,782 --> 00:59:42,278
Stay away from him!

990
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:43,718
He's never
had it so good.

991
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:46,785
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

992
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:47,877
Bring it on!
Come on!

993
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:48,798
L3!

994
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,059
Droid rights!
We are sentient!

995
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:53,117
I'm gonna flip your switch.

996
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:55,237
Good luck finding it.

997
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:56,471
L3!

998
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,248
Let go
of the mean man's face.

999
01:00:00,316 --> 01:00:01,121
We're leaving.

1000
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:03,427
They don't even
serve our kind here.

1001
01:00:03,568 --> 01:00:04,381
Now.

1002
01:00:08,193 --> 01:00:09,855
Who are these guys?

1003
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,033
We're taking them
to Kessel.

1004
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:12,841
Oh, are we?

1005
01:00:13,514 --> 01:00:15,779
And what if I don't elect
to go to Kessel?

1006
01:00:15,886 --> 01:00:17,085
Please don't start.

1007
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:18,744
Or what,
you'll have me wiped?

1008
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,083
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.

1009
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:22,596
Now you're gonna
make the Kessel Run?

1010
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,712
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

1011
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:26,480
- I don't mind.
- No, no. It's okay.

1012
01:00:26,826 --> 01:00:28,052
She's definitely going.

1013
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:31,285
Oh, why? Because
you're my organic overlord?

1014
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:33,249
Because I'm your
captain, how about that?

1015
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:35,793
I actually would have
her memory wiped,

1016
01:00:35,795 --> 01:00:36,612
but she's got
the best damn

1017
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:38,743
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1018
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:40,882
Could use a fresh coat
of paint, though!

1019
01:00:40,935 --> 01:00:45,365
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.

1020
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:48,120
You know, a lot of
ships around here get boosted.

1021
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:50,574
So, I keep mine locked up.

1022
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:52,290
You know, for safety.

1023
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,141
L3, do you mind?

1024
01:01:01,204 --> 01:01:02,720
Look away.

1025
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:04,592
I can't perform
with you looking at me.

1026
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:05,730
Please indulge her.

1027
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,896
I can feel you
looking at me.

1028
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:22,634
What are we
doing here?

1029
01:01:22,636 --> 01:01:23,870
This guy's a hustler.

1030
01:01:23,872 --> 01:01:25,306
I don't even think
he's got a ship.

1031
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:26,936
If he does, it's gonna
be a piece of junk

1032
01:01:27,023 --> 01:01:27,929
if it's even here.

1033
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:30,533
There she is,
my pride and joy.

1034
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:33,010
<i>The Millennium Falcon.</i>

1035
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,612
Looks like you had
a little work done.

1036
01:01:50,676 --> 01:01:52,243
Indeed I have, Han.

1037
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,740
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

1038
01:01:54,803 --> 01:01:57,413
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1039
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:59,068
And a fortified infraction

1040
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,333
restraint on the landing gear.

1041
01:02:01,748 --> 01:02:04,484
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

1042
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:07,064
This is unbelievable!

1043
01:02:07,425 --> 01:02:08,610
I'm definitely
gonna have some words

1044
01:02:08,612 --> 01:02:10,736
with someone about this.

1045
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:14,641
You must have experience
with these, right?

1046
01:02:14,656 --> 01:02:16,150
Yeah, I could
take it off.

1047
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:17,376
Fantastic!

1048
01:02:17,379 --> 01:02:19,345
Along with five percent
off your cut.

1049
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,057
You're down to 20.

1050
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:26,552
I don't like it.

1051
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:27,989
I don't agree with it.

1052
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:30,317
But I accept it.

1053
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:33,462
You're getting
the hang of this, Lando.

1054
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:35,592
Yeah.

1055
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:36,793
Come on, Chewie.

1056
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,001
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.

1057
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,932
<i>Your plan
is underway, Enfys.</i>

1058
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,574
<i>We've attached
the homing beacon.</i>

1059
01:02:44,576 --> 01:02:46,550
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

1060
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:47,626
<i>Good.</i>

1061
01:02:52,657 --> 01:02:56,247
<i>If they survive, they'll
bring the prize to us.</i>

1062
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:14,761
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1063
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,312
Oh. You know your stuff.

1064
01:03:17,884 --> 01:03:19,579
I've been on one before.

1065
01:03:19,635 --> 01:03:20,639
My dad worked the line

1066
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:23,143
at the CEC plant
before he got laid off.

1067
01:03:24,329 --> 01:03:25,497
He built these.

1068
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:29,048
He wanted
to be a pilot, but...

1069
01:03:29,423 --> 01:03:31,425
You, uh,
close with your old man?

1070
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:33,550
Not really.

1071
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:35,721
Yeah, me neither.

1072
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:37,857
My mom,
on the other hand,

1073
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,066
most amazing woman
I've ever known.

1074
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:44,462
Excuse me.

1075
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:47,215
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!

1076
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,873
My sacral-occipital
circuit is sticking.

1077
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:57,925
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

1078
01:03:58,237 --> 01:03:59,845
Yeah.

1079
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:02,069
All right, course
to Kessel is set.

1080
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,747
Plugging coordinates
in now.

1081
01:04:03,892 --> 01:04:05,312
Just keep your pinky
on the yoke

1082
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:06,550
and try not to mess
anything up.

1083
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,551
Whatever you say, my lady.

1084
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:09,187
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.

1085
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,920
Ready in...

1086
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:14,833
Ready.

1087
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:18,088
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.

1088
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,466
What's so tricky about that?

1089
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:21,878
Plenty. Can't plot
a direct course to Kessel.

1090
01:04:21,933 --> 01:04:23,458
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster

1091
01:04:23,515 --> 01:04:25,978
and then pass through
The Maelstrom.

1092
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,928
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.

1093
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:30,982
You might wanna
buckle up, baby.

1094
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,829
Think.

1095
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,597
Do you wanna
make that move?

1096
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,038
- Do you wanna
make that move?

1097
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:58,954
You made that move, okay.

1098
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,804
I guess I have to
destroy that little guy.

1099
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:03,986
Somehow I never
get bored with winning.

1100
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:08,040
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.

1101
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:11,118
Hey, hey, hey!
Chewie, relax!

1102
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,270
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1103
01:05:13,272 --> 01:05:15,650
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

1104
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,985
anticipate your opponent.

1105
01:05:17,025 --> 01:05:19,419
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

1106
01:05:19,491 --> 01:05:20,726
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

1107
01:05:23,593 --> 01:05:25,400
People are predictable.

1108
01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:49,316
Yeah, I had to
try one on.

1109
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,884
That's a lot of capes.

1110
01:05:50,955 --> 01:05:52,965
Maybe too many capes.

1111
01:05:57,364 --> 01:05:58,992
So what's the plan?

1112
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,594
Well, I thought
we'd talk a little first

1113
01:06:00,596 --> 01:06:02,453
and then you know...

1114
01:06:02,455 --> 01:06:04,458
- For Kessel.
- Oh.

1115
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,066
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

1116
01:06:06,144 --> 01:06:07,701
Yeah? How good?

1117
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:08,869
Foolproof.

1118
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:10,669
Well, it better be.

1119
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:11,738
- I...
- I...

1120
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:13,005
- You go first.
- No.

1121
01:06:13,045 --> 01:06:14,673
What were you gonna say?

1122
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,658
I wanna tell you
so much.

1123
01:06:18,143 --> 01:06:19,711
And I wanna know
everything

1124
01:06:19,752 --> 01:06:21,468
that's happened to you
since Corellia.

1125
01:06:22,888 --> 01:06:25,462
I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.

1126
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:26,718
We could.

1127
01:06:26,758 --> 01:06:29,140
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

1128
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,298
You and I.

1129
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:31,962
What?

1130
01:06:32,933 --> 01:06:34,268
I want to.

1131
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,328
You want to?

1132
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,479
To tell you everything
that's happened.

1133
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:42,401
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

1134
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,430
The way that you're
looking at me right now.

1135
01:06:44,547 --> 01:06:45,891
Nothing is gonna
change the way

1136
01:06:45,893 --> 01:06:46,740
I'm looking at you
right now.

1137
01:06:46,742 --> 01:06:49,227
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

1138
01:07:03,038 --> 01:07:04,600
Am I interrupting something?

1139
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:08,231
Kinda.

1140
01:07:08,922 --> 01:07:09,766
Good.

1141
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:12,128
'Cause we got
a lot of work to do.

1142
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:13,714
You're making
a big mistake.

1143
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:14,844
- Oh, really?
- Which is yours to make

1144
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:17,067
except when you start to
interfere with my livelihood.

1145
01:07:17,107 --> 01:07:18,134
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.

1146
01:07:18,174 --> 01:07:19,135
Then we have a problem.

1147
01:07:19,175 --> 01:07:21,633
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.

1148
01:07:21,635 --> 01:07:23,273
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.

1149
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:26,140
Maybe you don't know
her well enough.

1150
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:27,709
All right?

1151
01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:29,278
Look.

1152
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:31,447
I like you, kid.

1153
01:07:31,563 --> 01:07:34,034
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.

1154
01:07:34,098 --> 01:07:34,985
- Yeah.
- Right?

1155
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:37,244
The makings
of a solid crew.

1156
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:39,419
But it does not work
with Qi'ra.

1157
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,872
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.

1158
01:07:43,821 --> 01:07:46,576
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?

1159
01:07:47,472 --> 01:07:48,835
I trust no one.

1160
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:52,728
Assume everyone
will betray you

1161
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,609
and you will never
be disappointed.

1162
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:57,935
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

1163
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,468
It's the only way.

1164
01:08:07,736 --> 01:08:09,148
Dropping out
of lightspeed now.

1165
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:10,230
Ready to...

1166
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:17,640
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1167
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:21,236
I'm gonna go check
on the dampers.

1168
01:08:21,276 --> 01:08:22,205
You need anything?

1169
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:23,613
Equal rights?

1170
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:54,979
What's that sound?

1171
01:08:55,315 --> 01:08:58,235
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

1172
01:08:58,237 --> 01:09:00,764
Ships fly in there,
they never come out.

1173
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,813
It's ionized gas,
water vapor,

1174
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:04,593
possibly vacuum-breathing
life forms

1175
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:06,033
swirling around The Maw.

1176
01:09:06,106 --> 01:09:08,019
Only way in or out
is this channel.

1177
01:09:09,724 --> 01:09:11,958
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

1178
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:13,493
Problem?

1179
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:15,058
Uh...

1180
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:16,464
Well, that brand
on your wrist

1181
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:18,559
tells me that
you're committed.

1182
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:20,493
And that young male's
heart fluctuations

1183
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:21,900
tell me
he's in love with you.

1184
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,564
Han is not
in love with me!

1185
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,777
Oh, please. It's just us.

1186
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:31,386
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.

1187
01:09:31,496 --> 01:09:32,259
You are?

1188
01:09:32,261 --> 01:09:33,273
I'm sure you've noticed

1189
01:09:33,275 --> 01:09:34,746
that Lando
has feelings for me.

1190
01:09:34,748 --> 01:09:36,283
Which makes
working together difficult

1191
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:38,732
because I do not feel
the same way about him.

1192
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:40,128
Right.

1193
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:41,896
Yes, yeah.

1194
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:43,436
Yeah, I see that.

1195
01:09:43,522 --> 01:09:46,258
Sometimes, I think...
Maybe.

1196
01:09:46,987 --> 01:09:48,323
But, no.

1197
01:09:50,265 --> 01:09:51,832
We're just not compatible.

1198
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:55,489
How would that work?

1199
01:09:56,324 --> 01:09:57,323
It works.

1200
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,499
This is a precision job.

1201
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,119
Thermal vault will be
on the lowest level.

1202
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:13,531
Down where it's warm.

1203
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:16,053
The only way
we're gonna pull this off

1204
01:10:16,055 --> 01:10:18,259
is if everybody
plays their part.

1205
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,112
Stick to the plan.

1206
01:10:20,114 --> 01:10:22,250
Do not improvise.

1207
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:29,189
Mining colonies
are the worst.

1208
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,808
Yeah, well, "the worst"

1209
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,454
is where the money is.

1210
01:10:34,618 --> 01:10:36,829
All right, people.
Time to shine.

1211
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:15,184
It won't be for long.

1212
01:11:15,186 --> 01:11:17,114
Shut up, the both of you.

1213
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:18,876
I am Oksana Floren,

1214
01:11:18,878 --> 01:11:21,335
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the Vice-Admiral

1215
01:11:21,337 --> 01:11:24,188
of the Federation of
Trade Route Allocation

1216
01:11:24,223 --> 01:11:25,701
and Monetization.

1217
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:28,196
Here with an offer
from his eminence,

1218
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:30,249
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1219
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:33,887
Your spice for our
hard-working slaves.

1220
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:35,449
I brought you a sample.

1221
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,211
Tuul, bring forth
the merchandise.

1222
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,760
Director Tolsite
said our slaves

1223
01:12:08,762 --> 01:12:09,953
should follow those guys

1224
01:12:09,955 --> 01:12:11,811
to get clipped
and tagged.

1225
01:12:11,865 --> 01:12:13,997
What are they
clipping?

1226
01:12:14,056 --> 01:12:16,159
Mmm-hmm.

1227
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,208
He wants us
to follow him.

1228
01:12:23,276 --> 01:12:24,003
Really?

1229
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:25,301
That's for that stunt
you pulled earlier,

1230
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:26,693
you degenerate scum.

1231
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,890
He says all systems
in this sector

1232
01:12:47,892 --> 01:12:50,024
of the facility operate
out of this room.

1233
01:12:50,026 --> 01:12:51,720
It's how they're able
to maintain control

1234
01:12:51,722 --> 01:12:53,680
over so many
with so few.

1235
01:12:57,786 --> 01:12:59,828
The director says
their reconditioning process

1236
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,219
is excruciating
but effective.

1237
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:19,732
He said your security attache
can wait there.

1238
01:13:19,824 --> 01:13:22,093
"Surely, we don't need him
to negotiate."

1239
01:13:24,788 --> 01:13:26,297
Wait there, Tuul.

1240
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:28,097
Try not to bother anyone.

1241
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:54,064
Nice!

1242
01:13:54,733 --> 01:13:55,527
That was the uniform

1243
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,110
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.

1244
01:14:07,555 --> 01:14:09,356
Would you mind
holding this for me?

1245
01:14:23,785 --> 01:14:25,079
Whoa.
http://worldmkv.com/

1246
01:14:25,081 --> 01:14:26,991
I have never see anyone do...

1247
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:27,988
What was that?

1248
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,188
Teras Kasi.

1249
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:33,381
Dryden taught me.

1250
01:14:37,914 --> 01:14:39,018
Ah.

1251
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,286
Well negotiated.

1252
01:14:50,438 --> 01:14:52,607
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.

1253
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:53,699
Hello?

1254
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:57,471
Can you hear me? Ugh.

1255
01:14:57,857 --> 01:14:59,534
Restraining bolts...

1256
01:14:59,617 --> 01:15:00,826
Barbaric.

1257
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:04,707
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.

1258
01:15:04,711 --> 01:15:05,739
I don't know.

1259
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:07,175
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.

1260
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:08,782
Just give me some space.

1261
01:15:14,807 --> 01:15:16,085
I'm in!

1262
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:17,152
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

1263
01:15:17,154 --> 01:15:18,813
I kinda need to
know which way to go here.

1264
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:20,040
L3?

1265
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,761
The thermal vault
is down two levels,

1266
01:15:21,763 --> 01:15:23,777
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.

1267
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:26,820
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.

1268
01:15:33,775 --> 01:15:34,953
They're in subsector four,

1269
01:15:34,955 --> 01:15:37,404
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1270
01:15:37,406 --> 01:15:38,640
Overriding!

1271
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,894
Freedom.

1272
01:16:08,559 --> 01:16:10,621
What the hell
are you guys doing up there?

1273
01:16:10,795 --> 01:16:12,697
I created a distraction!

1274
01:16:17,557 --> 01:16:18,809
Come on! This way!

1275
01:16:21,314 --> 01:16:23,186
Wait! What are you doing?

1276
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:25,046
Come on,
we gotta get the coaxium.

1277
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,706
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

1278
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:32,645
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1279
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,017
Fine!

1280
01:16:39,526 --> 01:16:40,594
Chewie!

1281
01:16:43,256 --> 01:16:44,753
Here, you might need this.

1282
01:16:49,857 --> 01:16:51,857
Hope I see you around
sometime.

1283
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:08,880
Han, where are you?

1284
01:17:09,123 --> 01:17:10,716
<i>I'm on my way
to the vault.</i>

1285
01:17:10,819 --> 01:17:11,991
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

1286
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:13,066
He's dead?

1287
01:17:13,068 --> 01:17:14,922
No, he had something
he had to do.

1288
01:17:14,924 --> 01:17:16,184
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

1289
01:17:16,224 --> 01:17:17,232
I don't know.

1290
01:17:18,518 --> 01:17:20,520
Okay, they're on to us now.

1291
01:17:30,349 --> 01:17:31,416
I'm at the vault.

1292
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,733
That's what I said!

1293
01:17:44,048 --> 01:17:46,083
- Huh, that was impressive.
- Yeah.

1294
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:47,391
We're clear.

1295
01:17:57,963 --> 01:17:59,092
Now what?

1296
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:01,034
<i>Han, each canister
should be equipped</i>

1297
01:18:01,096 --> 01:18:02,294
<i>with a thermal display.</i>

1298
01:18:02,296 --> 01:18:03,476
Yeah, I see it.

1299
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:06,606
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,

1300
01:18:06,608 --> 01:18:09,738
<i>then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.</i>

1301
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,227
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.

1302
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:22,666
Okay, got it.

1303
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,479
Great. Only eleven more.

1304
01:18:24,923 --> 01:18:25,924
Eleven?

1305
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:36,382
<i>The Calrissian Chronicles,
chapter five.</i>

1306
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,097
<i>continued.</i>

1307
01:18:38,099 --> 01:18:40,158
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

1308
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,549
No sense of humor or style.

1309
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,699
Nonetheless,
there L3 and I were

1310
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:46,564
deep in their sacred temple.

1311
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:48,416
And that's when we saw it...

1312
01:18:50,965 --> 01:18:52,500
Always something.

1313
01:18:54,874 --> 01:18:56,736
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

1314
01:18:56,863 --> 01:18:58,872
<i>Is it
a mass breakout?</i>

1315
01:18:59,349 --> 01:19:00,325
L3, what did you do?

1316
01:19:00,327 --> 01:19:02,421
I found my true purpose,
Lando.

1317
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:03,739
That's what I've done.

1318
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:07,684
I'm so glad
we took this job!

1319
01:19:07,686 --> 01:19:09,156
That droid!

1320
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:10,317
L3, come on!

1321
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:15,199
Follow me, compatriots!

1322
01:19:22,469 --> 01:19:24,348
Another couple guards
just spotted me.

1323
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,300
I don't have a free hand
to take 'em out.

1324
01:19:26,302 --> 01:19:28,022
<i>- What do I do?
- Improvise.</i>

1325
01:19:28,078 --> 01:19:29,979
You said never improvise!

1326
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,022
Hi!

1327
01:19:40,077 --> 01:19:41,185
Don't forget that guy!

1328
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,370
Good to see you, buddy!

1329
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:01,642
Stay with me, Sagwa!
Keep up!

1330
01:20:05,014 --> 01:20:06,757
Hey! I'm Chewie's
friend, Han.

1331
01:20:09,491 --> 01:20:10,461
Okay.

1332
01:20:37,786 --> 01:20:39,920
Han!

1333
01:20:41,645 --> 01:20:42,646
Hey!

1334
01:20:53,922 --> 01:20:55,010
Follow me.

1335
01:20:57,373 --> 01:20:59,806
Rebellion!

1336
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,446
They're going for
the landing gear!

1337
01:21:11,448 --> 01:21:12,791
We've gotta
get out of here!

1338
01:21:14,651 --> 01:21:17,141
We need to keep 'em away
from those cannons!

1339
01:21:25,243 --> 01:21:26,444
Catch that!

1340
01:21:28,941 --> 01:21:30,786
Coaxium's stowed!
Let's go!

1341
01:21:31,226 --> 01:21:32,600
Where's L3?

1342
01:21:32,644 --> 01:21:35,715
No more subjugation!

1343
01:21:39,845 --> 01:21:41,152
L3!

1344
01:21:41,161 --> 01:21:43,163
No, Lando!
Get back here!

1345
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:47,121
Lando!

1346
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:49,852
System failure.

1347
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:52,090
Have to reroute
the sensory modulators.

1348
01:21:52,154 --> 01:21:53,772
It's all right.
Save your energy.

1349
01:21:53,774 --> 01:21:55,537
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?

1350
01:21:55,539 --> 01:21:57,173
System failure...

1351
01:22:02,728 --> 01:22:03,878
Rerouting...

1352
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:06,560
Damn it!

1353
01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:07,393
Han!

1354
01:22:13,082 --> 01:22:14,415
Sagwa.

1355
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:15,912
This way!

1356
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,070
Come, come!

1357
01:22:28,306 --> 01:22:29,973
Chewie!
Damn it!

1358
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,158
It's not responding.

1359
01:22:52,424 --> 01:22:54,528
What are you
standing around for? Come on!

1360
01:23:00,295 --> 01:23:01,854
It's okay,
you'll be fine.

1361
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:05,469
It's not responding...
Not responding...

1362
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:07,296
Han, get us out of here.

1363
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:09,153
It's not responding.

1364
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,516
Han! Now!

1365
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,199
On it.

1366
01:23:40,394 --> 01:23:41,614
- Lando...
- I'm here.

1367
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:43,891
- It's all right, L3.
- Lando...

1368
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,044
- I've got you.
- This is not...

1369
01:23:45,046 --> 01:23:46,604
- It's okay, L3.
- Lando.

1370
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:49,039
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.

1371
01:23:49,243 --> 01:23:50,443
Lando.

1372
01:23:50,445 --> 01:23:52,495
What's happening to me?

1373
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,431
L3?

1374
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:58,199
L3!

1375
01:24:05,317 --> 01:24:07,571
I'm sorry, girl.

1376
01:24:07,573 --> 01:24:09,175
I'm so sorry.

1377
01:24:23,053 --> 01:24:24,356
I could use a co-pilot.

1378
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,175
Sorry.

1379
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:53,976
With the cargo
we're carrying,

1380
01:24:53,978 --> 01:24:55,203
if we don't make up
some lost time

1381
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:57,567
we're gonna be
in real trouble.

1382
01:24:57,689 --> 01:24:59,214
How about that?
Is that real trouble?

1383
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,173
That is an Imperial blockade.

1384
01:25:08,175 --> 01:25:09,851
What's it doing here?

1385
01:25:09,853 --> 01:25:11,842
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.

1386
01:25:13,554 --> 01:25:15,384
Nope.
Not gonna make it.

1387
01:25:15,386 --> 01:25:16,617
We're gonna have to
drop the shipment.

1388
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:19,132
If we don't deliver,
Dryden will kill us.

1389
01:25:19,134 --> 01:25:20,829
All right, trust me,
I know these guys.

1390
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:22,094
I used to be one of 'em.

1391
01:25:22,096 --> 01:25:24,024
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

1392
01:25:24,026 --> 01:25:25,955
chasing down a little
rinky-dink freighter.

1393
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:31,532
You were saying?

1394
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:33,074
Usually,
in situations like this

1395
01:25:33,076 --> 01:25:35,202
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

1396
01:25:44,361 --> 01:25:45,863
I'm on the ventral gun.

1397
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:52,440
It's an easy equation.

1398
01:25:52,442 --> 01:25:54,472
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen

1399
01:25:54,474 --> 01:25:55,694
before the canisters explode!

1400
01:25:55,696 --> 01:25:57,070
Just have to find
a faster route.

1401
01:25:57,072 --> 01:25:58,172
There isn't one!
You can't make

1402
01:25:58,174 --> 01:25:59,958
the Kessel Run
in less than 20 parsecs.

1403
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,441
- Watch me.
- How?

1404
01:26:01,497 --> 01:26:03,380
Take a shortcut,
through there.

1405
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:06,376
- Into The Maelstrom?
- Mmm-hmm.

1406
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:08,432
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

1407
01:26:08,434 --> 01:26:10,322
- Can't do it without L3.
- She's gone!

1408
01:26:10,324 --> 01:26:11,712
You said yourself
she's got the best

1409
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:13,304
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1410
01:26:13,306 --> 01:26:14,483
If we remove
her neural core,

1411
01:26:14,485 --> 01:26:15,858
it's possible we can
download her brain

1412
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,007
<i>into the Falcon's
navicomputer, right?</i>

1413
01:26:18,086 --> 01:26:19,087
Could we?

1414
01:26:19,411 --> 01:26:20,642
Theoretically.

1415
01:26:20,644 --> 01:26:22,312
Only one way to find out.

1416
01:26:25,188 --> 01:26:27,155
I got a really good feeling
about this.

1417
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:43,035
Oops, that's on me.

1418
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,456
Okay.

1419
01:26:53,565 --> 01:26:55,408
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?

1420
01:26:58,613 --> 01:26:59,983
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

1421
01:26:59,985 --> 01:27:01,247
<i>Are they on us?</i>

1422
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,331
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1423
01:27:04,212 --> 01:27:05,710
I don't know
what that means.

1424
01:27:05,741 --> 01:27:07,970
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1425
01:27:08,222 --> 01:27:09,943
What?
Are they or aren't they?

1426
01:27:09,945 --> 01:27:11,758
Yes, they're still on us!

1427
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:15,099
Whoo!

1428
01:27:18,459 --> 01:27:23,274
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.

1429
01:27:23,312 --> 01:27:24,349
Come on!

1430
01:27:28,622 --> 01:27:31,302
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

1431
01:27:40,934 --> 01:27:42,303
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

1432
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:49,584
We need to
divert auxiliary power

1433
01:27:49,586 --> 01:27:50,837
to the rear deflector shield.

1434
01:27:50,839 --> 01:27:53,737
We definitely do!

1435
01:28:00,391 --> 01:28:02,164
Since when do you know
how to fly?

1436
01:28:04,637 --> 01:28:06,300
190 years old?

1437
01:28:08,175 --> 01:28:09,403
You look great!

1438
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:11,873
Chewie, get in.

1439
01:28:11,928 --> 01:28:13,009
I'll help Lando.

1440
01:28:28,021 --> 01:28:30,282
Whoa!
That's my cape!

1441
01:28:30,284 --> 01:28:32,061
Ah! That's a custom piece!

1442
01:28:39,579 --> 01:28:41,510
What? Beckett, you with us?

1443
01:28:41,512 --> 01:28:43,866
We just lost the cannon!

1444
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:45,829
And I really hurt
my thumbs.

1445
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:47,351
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

1446
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,796
Drop the landing gear.

1447
01:28:55,327 --> 01:28:56,798
When I tell you,
flood the intake

1448
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,333
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1449
01:29:02,027 --> 01:29:04,676
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

1450
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,627
best street racer
in all of Corellia.

1451
01:29:07,697 --> 01:29:09,025
Till he crashed

1452
01:29:09,152 --> 01:29:11,483
and died, doing this.

1453
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:30,944
Flood it, it's all yours!

1454
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:45,041
Nice move!

1455
01:29:48,053 --> 01:29:49,753
Pull out her
internal processor.

1456
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:53,665
Sorry.

1457
01:30:00,249 --> 01:30:01,374
We've got L3.

1458
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:04,895
Remove the mod calibrator.

1459
01:30:04,897 --> 01:30:05,958
Make sure
the T-Line's connected.

1460
01:30:06,014 --> 01:30:07,646
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.

1461
01:30:07,717 --> 01:30:08,681
You close?

1462
01:30:08,683 --> 01:30:11,146
That coaxium's
getting real ripe.

1463
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:13,517
Okay.

1464
01:30:15,414 --> 01:30:17,117
She's interfacing.

1465
01:30:21,219 --> 01:30:23,121
She's part of the ship now.

1466
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:36,174
Where the hell are we?

1467
01:30:36,218 --> 01:30:37,585
We're way off
the edge of the map.

1468
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,304
Wait.

1469
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,996
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.

1470
01:30:44,494 --> 01:30:46,895
She says we're
approaching The Maw.

1471
01:30:46,936 --> 01:30:48,065
That doesn't
sound like something

1472
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:49,573
we wanna be approaching.

1473
01:31:10,633 --> 01:31:11,576
Hang on!

1474
01:31:17,236 --> 01:31:18,025
This is The Maw?

1475
01:31:18,027 --> 01:31:20,070
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

1476
01:31:20,072 --> 01:31:21,307
That's a living thing.

1477
01:31:36,028 --> 01:31:37,323
There!

1478
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:38,501
That's The Maw.

1479
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,884
It's a gravity well.

1480
01:31:43,104 --> 01:31:44,182
I got an idea.

1481
01:31:45,331 --> 01:31:47,112
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1482
01:31:54,769 --> 01:31:56,041
See if it goes for this.

1483
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,878
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

1484
01:31:59,346 --> 01:32:00,514
I know.

1485
01:32:03,552 --> 01:32:04,822
Then why'd you do it?

1486
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,607
That's why, baby.

1487
01:32:22,527 --> 01:32:23,693
She found a way out.

1488
01:32:24,441 --> 01:32:27,053
90 degrees,
to the left... ish.

1489
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,053
Left-ish.

1490
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,419
I can't.

1491
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,329
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

1492
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,995
It's pulling us in.
We're stuck.

1493
01:32:36,957 --> 01:32:39,414
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

1494
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:41,407
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

1495
01:32:41,409 --> 01:32:42,840
Not the fuel line.

1496
01:32:42,842 --> 01:32:45,083
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,

1497
01:32:45,138 --> 01:32:45,645
it might just...

1498
01:32:45,704 --> 01:32:47,110
Give us the kick we need.

1499
01:32:47,151 --> 01:32:48,917
All right, I'm on it!

1500
01:32:53,338 --> 01:32:55,099
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.

1501
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:11,405
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

1502
01:33:11,484 --> 01:33:12,525
As soon as that
coaxium ignites,

1503
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:13,355
we're gonna
tear out of here

1504
01:33:13,357 --> 01:33:14,931
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,

1505
01:33:14,933 --> 01:33:16,323
we jump to lightspeed.

1506
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,458
Beckett!

1507
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,862
Can't talk!

1508
01:33:26,809 --> 01:33:27,843
I see it.

1509
01:33:52,381 --> 01:33:53,321
Beckett, hurry up!

1510
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:55,386
We only get one shot
at this thing!

1511
01:33:55,717 --> 01:33:57,651
Shut up
and let me do this!

1512
01:34:05,894 --> 01:34:08,495
Beckett, I'm gonna
count you down!

1513
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:10,845
Three!

1514
01:34:13,765 --> 01:34:14,799
Two!

1515
01:34:18,886 --> 01:34:20,024
Now!

1516
01:34:20,093 --> 01:34:21,121
Now?

1517
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:21,970
Now!

1518
01:34:38,202 --> 01:34:39,971
Oh, shoot...

1519
01:34:52,718 --> 01:34:54,168
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters

1520
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:55,904
- and jump to lightspeed.
- Wait, what are we...

1521
01:34:55,906 --> 01:34:57,107
Remember that alley
we slipped through

1522
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:58,268
in the Santhe Shipyards?

1523
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,318
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.

1524
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,621
This time it's gonna.

1525
01:35:11,832 --> 01:35:12,833
Punch it!

1526
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,946
<i>Savareen,
this is Millennium Falcon.</i>

1527
01:35:25,948 --> 01:35:28,850
<i>We have coaxium that needs to
be off-loaded immediately.</i>

1528
01:35:28,852 --> 01:35:31,288
<i>Like immediately,
immediately!</i>

1529
01:35:32,197 --> 01:35:33,525
<i>We're here now...</i>

1530
01:35:33,784 --> 01:35:34,885
<i>...see you. I...</i>

1531
01:36:05,864 --> 01:36:08,077
Just did the Kessel Run
in 12 parsecs.

1532
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:14,259
Not if you round down, buddy.

1533
01:36:14,613 --> 01:36:15,613
Yeah.

1534
01:36:21,676 --> 01:36:23,945
She is a hell of a ship.

1535
01:36:32,544 --> 01:36:34,005
I hate you.

1536
01:36:34,069 --> 01:36:35,536
I know.

1537
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:39,913
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1538
01:36:40,078 --> 01:36:41,871
in my quarters,

1539
01:36:41,873 --> 01:36:44,944
waiting for you
to bring me my share.

1540
01:36:47,153 --> 01:36:49,589
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.

1541
01:36:54,204 --> 01:36:55,605
Never?

1542
01:37:09,367 --> 01:37:11,295
Where's your boss?

1543
01:37:11,476 --> 01:37:13,803
Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1544
01:37:15,046 --> 01:37:15,881
Then what?

1545
01:37:16,481 --> 01:37:19,278
Well, you delivered,

1546
01:37:19,576 --> 01:37:21,572
so you will get paid.

1547
01:37:21,846 --> 01:37:24,237
You can buy that ship.

1548
01:37:24,299 --> 01:37:27,469
You know that's not
what I'm asking.

1549
01:37:30,138 --> 01:37:31,773
It can't happen.

1550
01:37:36,034 --> 01:37:37,418
Because you're with Dryden?

1551
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,532
I'm not with him,
but I owe him.

1552
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:44,297
He helped me out
of a bad situation.

1553
01:37:45,513 --> 01:37:47,543
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

1554
01:37:51,019 --> 01:37:53,621
Everyone serves
somebody, Han.

1555
01:37:54,475 --> 01:37:56,797
Even Dryden Vos.

1556
01:37:56,843 --> 01:37:59,618
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1557
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:02,070
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

1558
01:38:02,072 --> 01:38:03,562
if I left here with you.

1559
01:38:03,564 --> 01:38:05,405
I'm not afraid
of Crimson Dawn.

1560
01:38:05,407 --> 01:38:07,536
I can take care of myself.

1561
01:38:07,775 --> 01:38:09,147
You know,
I'm not the kid you knew

1562
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:10,718
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

1563
01:38:10,764 --> 01:38:11,851
- No?
- No.

1564
01:38:11,853 --> 01:38:12,920
Then who are you?

1565
01:38:13,905 --> 01:38:15,252
I'm an outlaw.

1566
01:38:17,155 --> 01:38:18,434
What? I'm not kidding.

1567
01:38:18,527 --> 01:38:19,743
Okay.

1568
01:38:19,745 --> 01:38:22,636
Okay, outlaw,
you can tell yourself that,

1569
01:38:22,785 --> 01:38:24,991
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

1570
01:38:24,993 --> 01:38:26,538
who knows
what you really are.

1571
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,435
Yeah.

1572
01:38:28,437 --> 01:38:29,772
What's that?

1573
01:38:32,179 --> 01:38:33,682
You are the good guy.

1574
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:38,631
I am not the good guy.

1575
01:38:38,633 --> 01:38:42,297
I am definitely
not a good guy.

1576
01:38:42,539 --> 01:38:43,970
I'm a terrible person.

1577
01:38:44,517 --> 01:38:45,893
Hey!

1578
01:38:45,895 --> 01:38:47,481
They say when
the coaxium's refined,

1579
01:38:47,483 --> 01:38:49,030
we collect it up there.

1580
01:39:13,563 --> 01:39:15,656
So, I hear
you make good brandy.

1581
01:39:19,073 --> 01:39:20,508
<i>Beckett.</i>

1582
01:39:45,231 --> 01:39:46,299
Don't.

1583
01:39:47,677 --> 01:39:50,237
<i>You must've known
you'd see me again.</i>

1584
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:51,767
I was counting on it.

1585
01:39:51,769 --> 01:39:54,083
Just didn't plan on it
being so soon.

1586
01:39:55,233 --> 01:39:57,066
Of course now,
you've got a problem.

1587
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:59,012
Big problem.

1588
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:05,239
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

1589
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,447
You know what's on it?

1590
01:40:07,495 --> 01:40:09,341
About 30 hired guns.

1591
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:11,555
All I gotta do
is give 'em the signal,

1592
01:40:11,557 --> 01:40:12,792
you're surrounded.

1593
01:40:28,841 --> 01:40:30,843
Sorry.
You do your thing.

1594
01:40:32,174 --> 01:40:34,518
By the time that coaxium
gets refined,

1595
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,319
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1596
01:40:36,321 --> 01:40:38,324
so you go ahead
and kill us.

1597
01:40:38,326 --> 01:40:40,221
They're gonna kill you.

1598
01:40:40,223 --> 01:40:41,652
Perhaps
there's a compromise,

1599
01:40:41,654 --> 01:40:43,444
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

1600
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:45,807
They're marauders.

1601
01:40:45,809 --> 01:40:47,945
They don't care
about anybody.

1602
01:40:48,853 --> 01:40:50,754
All they know
how to do is kill.

1603
01:41:14,257 --> 01:41:15,691
I need a drink.

1604
01:41:16,179 --> 01:41:17,715
Bring them inside.

1605
01:41:29,777 --> 01:41:31,712
My mother once told me

1606
01:41:31,714 --> 01:41:33,072
about a band of mercenaries

1607
01:41:33,074 --> 01:41:35,403
that came
to a peaceful planet.

1608
01:41:35,596 --> 01:41:38,825
They had a resource there
these men coveted,

1609
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:40,962
so they took it.

1610
01:41:41,048 --> 01:41:44,361
They kept coming back,
taking more.

1611
01:41:44,363 --> 01:41:46,991
Until finally,
the people resisted.

1612
01:41:47,272 --> 01:41:49,032
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

1613
01:41:49,034 --> 01:41:52,697
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

1614
01:41:52,985 --> 01:41:55,249
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1615
01:41:55,383 --> 01:41:56,280
so they cut off the tongue

1616
01:41:56,282 --> 01:42:00,013
of every last man,
woman, and child.

1617
01:42:00,423 --> 01:42:02,191
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?

1618
01:42:03,876 --> 01:42:04,876
Tell them.

1619
01:42:16,467 --> 01:42:18,328
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates

1620
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:19,861
have committed
unspeakable crimes

1621
01:42:19,863 --> 01:42:21,069
across the galaxy.

1622
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:24,270
Says you.

1623
01:42:24,334 --> 01:42:25,363
No.

1624
01:42:25,484 --> 01:42:27,355
Says them.

1625
01:42:27,357 --> 01:42:29,412
Each of our worlds
has been brutalized

1626
01:42:29,414 --> 01:42:31,205
by the Syndicates.

1627
01:42:31,207 --> 01:42:32,823
Crimson Dawn
will use their profits

1628
01:42:32,825 --> 01:42:34,042
from the coaxium you stole

1629
01:42:34,044 --> 01:42:36,500
to tyrannize
system after system

1630
01:42:36,575 --> 01:42:38,670
in league with the Empire.

1631
01:42:38,672 --> 01:42:40,692
And what would you
use it for?

1632
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,262
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

1633
01:42:43,264 --> 01:42:45,800
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.

1634
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:48,472
To fight back.

1635
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:52,036
We're not marauders.

1636
01:42:52,264 --> 01:42:53,999
We're allies

1637
01:42:54,697 --> 01:42:56,501
and the war
has just begun.

1638
01:43:12,495 --> 01:43:15,790
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1639
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,914
Joining the cause,
Han Solo?

1640
01:43:17,916 --> 01:43:20,310
Just trying
to make it out alive.

1641
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:21,483
Got a plan?

1642
01:43:21,485 --> 01:43:22,979
Yeah, beginning of one.

1643
01:43:23,091 --> 01:43:23,679
Way to get our money

1644
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:24,566
and get out from
under the thumb

1645
01:43:24,568 --> 01:43:26,862
of Crimson Dawn
at the same time.

1646
01:43:26,908 --> 01:43:29,427
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

1647
01:43:30,247 --> 01:43:33,038
You don't tangle
with Dryden.

1648
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,369
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel

1649
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:39,131
with hired guns,
his own private army.

1650
01:43:39,626 --> 01:43:41,188
So does Enfys.

1651
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:43,557
Listen, here's what
I got so far.

1652
01:43:45,604 --> 01:43:47,470
What do you think
they're saying?

1653
01:43:50,994 --> 01:43:52,627
He's gonna try to help you.

1654
01:43:58,444 --> 01:44:00,079
I see.

1655
01:44:01,355 --> 01:44:05,081
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

1656
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:07,585
That's why I need my partner.

1657
01:44:11,838 --> 01:44:13,671
Not this time.

1658
01:44:13,974 --> 01:44:15,469
I'm leaving.

1659
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:17,601
If you're smart,
you'll come with me.

1660
01:44:17,737 --> 01:44:19,865
I thought you didn't
believe in running.

1661
01:44:19,896 --> 01:44:22,132
I prefer it to dying.

1662
01:44:49,598 --> 01:44:52,195
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,

1663
01:44:52,298 --> 01:44:53,799
find me on Tatooine.

1664
01:44:54,627 --> 01:44:56,556
What's on Tatooine?

1665
01:44:56,558 --> 01:44:57,595
Heard about a job,

1666
01:44:57,597 --> 01:45:00,426
big shot gangster
putting together a crew.

1667
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,568
That'll be the one.

1668
01:45:02,688 --> 01:45:03,546
The one?

1669
01:45:03,548 --> 01:45:05,745
My last score.

1670
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:07,450
Yeah, I still got
some debts to pay

1671
01:45:07,452 --> 01:45:10,053
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm

1672
01:45:10,742 --> 01:45:12,743
and get into the valachord.

1673
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,388
Welcome home.

1674
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:49,287
He's waiting for you.

1675
01:45:49,382 --> 01:45:50,382
Thanks, Toht.

1676
01:45:52,336 --> 01:45:53,822
Weapons.

1677
01:45:53,824 --> 01:45:55,125
I didn't bring 'em.

1678
01:45:56,764 --> 01:45:58,130
They're fine.

1679
01:46:02,484 --> 01:46:04,287
We're gonna win.

1680
01:46:07,335 --> 01:46:09,632
It's not that kind
of game, Han.

1681
01:46:10,774 --> 01:46:11,979
The object isn't to win.

1682
01:46:11,981 --> 01:46:14,132
It's just to stay in it
as long as you can.

1683
01:46:17,284 --> 01:46:18,753
You don't know everything.

1684
01:46:19,795 --> 01:46:20,996
No.

1685
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:25,609
Just a bit more than you.

1686
01:46:33,734 --> 01:46:34,722
I knew it!

1687
01:46:35,515 --> 01:46:36,559
My men, they all said,

1688
01:46:36,561 --> 01:46:38,915
"There's no way
they pull this off."

1689
01:46:38,917 --> 01:46:40,599
"Qi'ra's not ready."
That's what they said,

1690
01:46:40,601 --> 01:46:42,735
but I had faith anyway.

1691
01:46:44,721 --> 01:46:45,990
Where's Beckett?

1692
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:47,452
Beckett didn't make it.

1693
01:46:51,535 --> 01:46:52,400
Tell me.

1694
01:46:52,402 --> 01:46:54,831
Job took a bad turn
on Kessel.

1695
01:46:55,223 --> 01:46:57,044
He died saving my life.

1696
01:46:57,201 --> 01:46:59,190
How are you holding up?
You all right?

1697
01:46:59,279 --> 01:46:59,948
I'm okay.

1698
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:01,644
All right, good.

1699
01:47:01,935 --> 01:47:03,647
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1700
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:05,016
- No. Thank you.
- No?

1701
01:47:05,018 --> 01:47:07,611
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1702
01:47:07,613 --> 01:47:08,630
I always admired him.

1703
01:47:08,632 --> 01:47:10,398
He was a man of principles.

1704
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,861
When he made a commitment,
he honored it

1705
01:47:12,863 --> 01:47:15,184
and I think we can
all take solace

1706
01:47:15,186 --> 01:47:17,660
in knowing how proud
he would've been

1707
01:47:17,662 --> 01:47:21,236
to see you here,
following his example.

1708
01:47:21,296 --> 01:47:22,946
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

1709
01:47:22,948 --> 01:47:24,409
They'll make
reliable smugglers,

1710
01:47:24,411 --> 01:47:25,740
should we ever
have the need

1711
01:47:25,742 --> 01:47:27,528
when they get
their own ship.

1712
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:29,898
Qi'ra.
Come here.
http://worldmkv.com/

1713
01:47:31,842 --> 01:47:33,595
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity

1714
01:47:33,597 --> 01:47:35,353
to work for you again, sir.

1715
01:47:35,355 --> 01:47:36,746
I would've been
inconsolable

1716
01:47:36,748 --> 01:47:38,589
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.

1717
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:42,001
I have no one else
in my life

1718
01:47:42,392 --> 01:47:44,994
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.

1719
01:47:48,722 --> 01:47:51,793
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment

1720
01:47:51,795 --> 01:47:52,587
and get going.

1721
01:47:52,589 --> 01:47:53,711
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...

1722
01:47:53,713 --> 01:47:54,879
What?

1723
01:47:54,881 --> 01:47:56,390
...and black markets
to dominate.

1724
01:47:56,392 --> 01:47:58,756
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.

1725
01:47:59,469 --> 01:48:01,628
You want me to open it?

1726
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:03,666
Oh, yes, Han.
I really do.

1727
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:31,596
Bring me one.

1728
01:48:31,598 --> 01:48:34,056
I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.

1729
01:48:34,058 --> 01:48:36,454
It's very explosive stuff.

1730
01:48:37,005 --> 01:48:39,236
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.

1731
01:48:59,926 --> 01:49:01,394
Careful.

1732
01:49:05,465 --> 01:49:07,299
It's magnificent.

1733
01:49:07,878 --> 01:49:09,107
How'd you do it?

1734
01:49:09,225 --> 01:49:10,064
Wasn't easy.

1735
01:49:10,066 --> 01:49:11,059
No, I mean,
how'd you do it?

1736
01:49:11,061 --> 01:49:14,158
It looks exactly
like the real thing.

1737
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:17,088
That's 'cause it is
the real thing.

1738
01:49:17,142 --> 01:49:17,814
Yes, and I'm saying

1739
01:49:17,816 --> 01:49:19,972
I would believe you.
It's that good.

1740
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,803
But my associate
already told me

1741
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:24,658
about your plan to rob me
of my money

1742
01:49:24,707 --> 01:49:27,471
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

1743
01:49:27,473 --> 01:49:29,179
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking

1744
01:49:29,181 --> 01:49:30,729
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...

1745
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:33,113
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.

1746
01:49:33,115 --> 01:49:34,407
Qi'ra, it turns out

1747
01:49:34,472 --> 01:49:36,092
has a weak spot for you,

1748
01:49:36,094 --> 01:49:37,923
and we'll deal
with that later.

1749
01:49:37,925 --> 01:49:41,887
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.

1750
01:49:41,927 --> 01:49:43,929
Can you come in
and join us, please?

1751
01:49:55,809 --> 01:49:58,944
I am sorry, kid.

1752
01:50:02,113 --> 01:50:03,475
Why?

1753
01:50:03,813 --> 01:50:04,641
Come on.

1754
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:06,677
Don't look at me like that.

1755
01:50:06,717 --> 01:50:07,707
You weren't paying attention.

1756
01:50:07,709 --> 01:50:10,471
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."

1757
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:13,608
Am I wrong about that?

1758
01:50:16,046 --> 01:50:17,193
Uh-uh-uh.

1759
01:50:17,809 --> 01:50:19,554
Back away from that.

1760
01:50:19,556 --> 01:50:21,450
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.

1761
01:50:21,588 --> 01:50:23,423
Check that lid.

1762
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:26,931
Clever.

1763
01:50:27,155 --> 01:50:28,867
It's too late.

1764
01:50:28,907 --> 01:50:31,299
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.

1765
01:50:31,301 --> 01:50:33,637
Well, we figured that.

1766
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,594
Drop your weapons.

1767
01:50:53,192 --> 01:50:56,097
<i>It's over.
We got them.</i>

1768
01:50:56,255 --> 01:50:57,426
And there we have it.

1769
01:50:57,428 --> 01:50:59,362
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.

1770
01:50:59,364 --> 01:51:01,084
Qi'ra, help me.

1771
01:51:03,429 --> 01:51:04,763
Tell me what to do.

1772
01:51:05,832 --> 01:51:07,582
What would you do

1773
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:11,708
if the person you most
trusted in the world

1774
01:51:12,282 --> 01:51:13,750
betrayed you?

1775
01:51:16,502 --> 01:51:17,914
I would want
to know why.

1776
01:51:20,128 --> 01:51:22,290
If it was
a moment of weakness

1777
01:51:22,461 --> 01:51:23,467
or something else.

1778
01:51:23,516 --> 01:51:24,518
And then what?

1779
01:51:26,062 --> 01:51:29,091
And then,
I would ask that person

1780
01:51:29,131 --> 01:51:31,384
to prove their loyalty

1781
01:51:31,386 --> 01:51:35,123
by sacrificing
something they love.

1782
01:51:43,546 --> 01:51:45,677
I tried to warn you
about her.

1783
01:51:45,943 --> 01:51:48,421
You know, you're wrong
about one thing.

1784
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:49,810
What?

1785
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:52,147
I was paying attention.

1786
01:51:52,187 --> 01:51:54,454
You told Chewie
people are predictable.

1787
01:51:56,991 --> 01:51:59,093
You're no exception.

1788
01:52:04,752 --> 01:52:05,881
It's empty.

1789
01:52:05,945 --> 01:52:07,388
<i>The case is empty.</i>

1790
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:09,799
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

1791
01:52:09,801 --> 01:52:11,337
Aemon?

1792
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,367
Talk to me.

1793
01:52:38,341 --> 01:52:41,071
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

1794
01:52:41,073 --> 01:52:42,771
because that would leave you

1795
01:52:42,773 --> 01:52:45,226
a little shorthanded
around here.

1796
01:52:46,181 --> 01:52:47,620
So,

1797
01:52:47,622 --> 01:52:52,075
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

1798
01:52:52,155 --> 01:52:54,023
Leaves here
with one of us.

1799
01:52:59,089 --> 01:53:00,466
Beckett,
what are you doing?

1800
01:53:00,468 --> 01:53:01,516
Thinking.

1801
01:53:01,568 --> 01:53:02,916
And I prefer to be
the only one

1802
01:53:02,983 --> 01:53:04,807
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.

1803
01:53:04,855 --> 01:53:06,459
Han, grab that coaxium,

1804
01:53:06,461 --> 01:53:07,758
put it in the case.

1805
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,534
Big stuff,
you're coming with me.

1806
01:53:11,242 --> 01:53:12,583
Don't do this,
Beckett.

1807
01:53:12,585 --> 01:53:14,379
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

1808
01:53:14,381 --> 01:53:15,231
I'm sorry,

1809
01:53:15,311 --> 01:53:16,873
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1810
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:19,456
I mean, you of all people
understand that.

1811
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:20,679
Come on, let's go.

1812
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:23,574
You're making
a huge mistake.

1813
01:53:23,657 --> 01:53:24,919
Won't be my first.

1814
01:53:24,977 --> 01:53:26,549
It's gonna be your last.

1815
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:27,979
Maybe.

1816
01:53:28,913 --> 01:53:30,319
Why you gotta be
so negative?

1817
01:53:43,126 --> 01:53:44,444
Han,

1818
01:53:44,446 --> 01:53:45,797
now's as good a time as any

1819
01:53:45,799 --> 01:53:47,892
to reevaluate
our relationship.

1820
01:53:48,412 --> 01:53:49,403
How so?

1821
01:53:50,087 --> 01:53:52,034
I was just thinking,

1822
01:53:52,036 --> 01:53:55,033
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

1823
01:53:55,035 --> 01:53:57,905
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

1824
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:01,181
Oh, Han.

1825
01:54:27,849 --> 01:54:30,209
You can't win, Han,
and even if you could,

1826
01:54:30,268 --> 01:54:31,475
you'd spend
the rest of your life

1827
01:54:31,477 --> 01:54:32,789
looking over your shoulder.

1828
01:54:33,879 --> 01:54:34,879
You know what?

1829
01:54:35,855 --> 01:54:37,811
I'm kind of getting
used to the idea.

1830
01:54:45,176 --> 01:54:46,770
I'm sorry.

1831
01:54:46,842 --> 01:54:48,250
Han, she's done things that

1832
01:54:48,252 --> 01:54:51,049
you could never understand,
but I do.

1833
01:54:51,759 --> 01:54:53,727
I understand her completely.

1834
01:54:54,614 --> 01:54:56,988
Once you're a part
of Crimson Dawn,

1835
01:54:57,137 --> 01:54:58,792
you can't leave.

1836
01:54:58,832 --> 01:55:00,535
It's not true.

1837
01:55:00,636 --> 01:55:02,063
I know you.

1838
01:55:02,268 --> 01:55:04,372
It's what I was taught.

1839
01:55:04,374 --> 01:55:06,262
Find your
opponent's weakness,

1840
01:55:06,373 --> 01:55:07,666
and use it,

1841
01:55:07,706 --> 01:55:09,809
and today...

1842
01:55:11,806 --> 01:55:13,144
I'm yours.

1843
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,847
I had to.

1844
01:55:41,444 --> 01:55:43,505
Yeah.
No, I mean, you did...

1845
01:55:44,186 --> 01:55:46,122
You did.

1846
01:55:48,232 --> 01:55:50,389
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

1847
01:55:50,449 --> 01:55:51,644
What are you gonna do?

1848
01:55:51,646 --> 01:55:54,407
Well, if we give
all the coaxium to Enfys,

1849
01:55:54,512 --> 01:55:57,183
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

1850
01:56:10,941 --> 01:56:13,570
- Qi'ra...
- Go and save Chewbacca.

1851
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:16,688
He needs you and you're
gonna need him, too.

1852
01:56:23,152 --> 01:56:24,153
Smile.

1853
01:56:27,006 --> 01:56:28,287
That's the word.

1854
01:56:29,445 --> 01:56:30,598
Whenever I imagined myself

1855
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:32,536
off with you
on some adventure...

1856
01:56:33,979 --> 01:56:36,046
Always makes me smile.

1857
01:56:43,521 --> 01:56:45,356
Go. I'm right behind you.

1858
01:57:37,218 --> 01:57:38,529
<i>Yes?</i>

1859
01:57:38,531 --> 01:57:41,928
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

1860
01:57:42,182 --> 01:57:43,896
murdered by the thief
he hired

1861
01:57:43,898 --> 01:57:45,501
to steal
the coaxium shipment,

1862
01:57:45,503 --> 01:57:46,765
his friend,

1863
01:57:46,964 --> 01:57:48,825
Tobias Beckett.

1864
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,941
<i>Is that so?</i>

1865
01:57:51,729 --> 01:57:54,958
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

1866
01:57:55,335 --> 01:57:56,497
Gone.

1867
01:57:56,537 --> 01:57:57,534
Beckett took it.

1868
01:57:57,612 --> 01:58:00,248
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.

1869
01:58:03,032 --> 01:58:06,265
<i>One man couldn't have
done this alone.</i>

1870
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:08,833
I wasn't there,

1871
01:58:08,835 --> 01:58:11,469
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

1872
01:58:19,698 --> 01:58:23,128
<i>Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir</i>

1873
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:25,160
<i>and you and I
will then decide</i>

1874
01:58:25,162 --> 01:58:27,955
<i>what to do about
the traitor, Beckett,</i>

1875
01:58:28,011 --> 01:58:30,445
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

1876
01:58:32,574 --> 01:58:33,709
I'm on my way.

1877
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:37,520
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

1878
01:58:37,522 --> 01:58:38,850
<i>you and I</i>

1879
01:58:38,852 --> 01:58:42,153
<i>will be working
much more closely</i>

1880
01:58:42,262 --> 01:58:44,230
<i>from now on.</i>

1881
01:59:14,327 --> 01:59:16,456
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.

1882
01:59:17,854 --> 01:59:19,956
Came as fast
as I could, buddy.

1883
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,861
Dryden dead?

1884
01:59:23,871 --> 01:59:25,704
Qi'ra kill him?

1885
01:59:27,493 --> 01:59:30,056
Still don't get it,
do you, kid?

1886
01:59:30,306 --> 01:59:32,540
It was never about you.

1887
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:34,378
She's a survivor.

1888
01:59:35,545 --> 01:59:37,101
You know what
your problem is?

1889
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:39,171
You think
everybody's like you.

1890
01:59:39,941 --> 01:59:41,627
Not you, kid.

1891
01:59:41,629 --> 01:59:43,065
You're nothing like me.

1892
01:59:45,072 --> 01:59:46,710
I hope you're still
paying attention

1893
01:59:46,712 --> 01:59:48,788
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...

1894
02:00:03,955 --> 02:00:06,403
You made
the smart move, kid.

1895
02:00:06,405 --> 02:00:07,961
For once.

1896
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:10,969
I woulda killed you.

1897
02:00:18,317 --> 02:00:23,231
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.

1898
02:00:23,348 --> 02:00:24,549
I know.

1899
02:02:17,721 --> 02:02:19,201
That's it.
It's all loaded.

1900
02:02:23,212 --> 02:02:24,807
Do you know
what that really is?

1901
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:25,785
Yeah.

1902
02:02:25,787 --> 02:02:28,772
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

1903
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:30,085
No.

1904
02:02:30,087 --> 02:02:32,524
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

1905
02:02:32,767 --> 02:02:34,868
Yeah, what?

1906
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:35,905
A rebellion.

1907
02:02:37,105 --> 02:02:38,922
You could come with us,
you know.

1908
02:02:38,924 --> 02:02:41,253
We need warriors
and leaders like you.

1909
02:02:47,805 --> 02:02:49,969
Maybe someday
you'll feel different.

1910
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:52,628
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1911
02:03:07,397 --> 02:03:08,583
Don't lose that.

1912
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,471
Very few people
have actually seen

1913
02:03:22,630 --> 02:03:23,980
the StarCave Nebula.

1914
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:25,349
It's breathtaking.

1915
02:03:25,374 --> 02:03:26,859
Not unlike your eyes.

1916
02:03:27,017 --> 02:03:29,089
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

1917
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:31,309
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

1918
02:03:32,261 --> 02:03:33,513
By the way...

1919
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,189
Han!

1920
02:03:41,307 --> 02:03:42,441
You're alive!

1921
02:03:42,443 --> 02:03:43,769
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1922
02:03:43,771 --> 02:03:45,535
I should have Chewie
rip your arms off.

1923
02:03:45,537 --> 02:03:47,065
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1924
02:03:47,067 --> 02:03:48,241
Hey, Han!
We are friends.

1925
02:03:48,243 --> 02:03:49,957
You know that.
We're friends. All right?

1926
02:03:55,155 --> 02:03:57,030
Oh, look at you.

1927
02:03:57,032 --> 02:03:58,924
Thought he was gonna
rip your arms off.

1928
02:03:59,045 --> 02:04:00,002
I knew you were kidding.

1929
02:04:00,004 --> 02:04:00,848
No, you didn't.

1930
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:02,671
- So, where's my cut?
- Your cut?

1931
02:04:03,777 --> 02:04:05,993
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

1932
02:04:05,995 --> 02:04:07,796
All we ended up with
was that.

1933
02:04:08,588 --> 02:04:10,216
Mmm-mmm.

1934
02:04:10,218 --> 02:04:11,741
Figure it's worth
about 10,000,

1935
02:04:11,743 --> 02:04:13,464
maybe enough
for a decent buy-in.

1936
02:04:15,585 --> 02:04:17,020
You want a rematch?

1937
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:19,659
Why not?

1938
02:04:23,566 --> 02:04:25,527
You fold now,

1939
02:04:25,597 --> 02:04:26,472
you walk away with enough

1940
02:04:26,474 --> 02:04:28,569
to get yourself
your own little ship.

1941
02:04:29,185 --> 02:04:30,488
You call,

1942
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:33,288
I'm gonna
clean you out again.

1943
02:04:45,813 --> 02:04:47,138
I don't know,
I'm feeling lucky.

1944
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:51,946
Ooh.

1945
02:04:52,064 --> 02:04:54,427
<i>You really have it bad
for the Falcon, don't you?</i>

1946
02:04:54,499 --> 02:04:57,128
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.

1947
02:05:06,778 --> 02:05:09,273
You got everything
you need there, pal?

1948
02:05:19,094 --> 02:05:20,563
Not bad.

1949
02:05:20,938 --> 02:05:23,579
Not bad. You know,

1950
02:05:23,581 --> 02:05:27,425
if you'd only had
this little green sylop,

1951
02:05:27,427 --> 02:05:28,923
you would've beaten this.

1952
02:05:34,774 --> 02:05:37,741
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.

1953
02:05:48,435 --> 02:05:49,963
Beckett said
he heard about this

1954
02:05:49,965 --> 02:05:52,253
very big gangster
putting together a job.

1955
02:05:53,042 --> 02:05:55,209
No, I'm telling ya,

1956
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:56,578
it's gonna be great.

When have I ever
steered you wrong?
