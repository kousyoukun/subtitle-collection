16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,770
毗羲会给我一份额外口粮的
Proxima'll give me an extra portion for this!

17
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,730
不 我觉得她会把额外口粮给我的
Nope, I think she's gonna give that extra portion to me.

18

在交易的过程中
I was in the middle of the exchange,

34
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,450
我正准备交出核芯素
I'm handing over the coaxium

35
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,290
他的手下袭击了我 我耍了他们

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,930
你是怎么办到的
How?

37
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,100
我逃走了 然后偷了他们的飞车
I ran away, then I boosted their speeder.

38
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,160
我们是不是可以离开这里了

汉回来了 快去

42
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,490

值五六百个信用点
Five, six hundred credits.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
我们现在不缺钱了
That's more than you said we'd need.

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,920
那我们可以用这笔钱离开控制区了
To buy our way out of the control zone.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,350
离开克雷利亚星球

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,460
汉 我们能远走高飞了...

莫克洛 你好吗

54
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,070
我正准备去见毗羲夫人呢
I was just on my way to see Lady Proxima.

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,400
你还有钱还债吗

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,150

说出来你都不信 怎么说呢 我是...
You're not gonna believe it. You'll believe it, but...

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,920
搜他的身

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,520
不许动 臭老鼠
Hold still, scrumrat!

60
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,130
轻点儿
Easy.

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,290
快走
Come on.

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,410
好的
All right.

63
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,670
我们去见毗羲夫人
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

64
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,260
说说吧 怎么回事
Well, what happened?

65
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,600
我告诉您发生了什么
I'll tell you what happened.

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,810
他们背叛了您 还想杀了我
They double-crossed you and tried to kill me.

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,640
那钱呢
The money?

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,460
- 他们抢了 - 那我的核芯素呢
- They kept it. - And my coaxium?

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,540
他们也抢走了
They kept that, too.

70
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,550
不过倒是给我们上了一课
But we learned a very valuable lesson.

71
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,190
我们不能相信那群家伙
We cannot trust those guys.

72
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,050
所以你认为我们会相信你
So you expect me to believe

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,690
就看你这么两手空空的回来了
that you walked away with nothing!

74
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,980
我...带着小命逃回来的 不算两手空空吧
I ran away with my life. I think that's something.

75
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,180
我觉得我自己的命还是很重要的
To me, that's a lot.

76
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,480
我交给你这么简单的一个任务
I trusted you with a simple task,

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,260
你回来的时候却是满腹借口
and all I'm hearing are excuses.

78
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,590
不听话就得接受惩罚
There must be consequences for disobedience

79
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,450
不然你永远都不长记性
or else you never learn.

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,580
我告诉你
You know what?

81
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,970
我就是永远不长记性
I don't think I'm ever gonna learn.

82
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,640
你说什么
What did you say?

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,060
我说 以后谁再敢打我
I said, next time somebody hits me,

84
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,500
我就打回去
I hit 'em back.

85
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,610
莫洛克 等等
Moloch, wait!

86
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,970
不要
Don't!

87
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,490
琦拉 你还记得那个地窖吗
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,360
我们把你解救出来
We pulled you out of that horror,

89
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,910
收留了你
gave you a home.

90
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,620
不要为了汉放弃这一切 他不值得你这样
Don't throw it away for Han. He's not worth it!

91
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,110
他在交易中损失的那些 我们会双倍赚回来
Whatever he lost on the deal, we'll earn it back, double.

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
我们会补偿您的
We will make it up to you.

93
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,990
所有人都给我退后
Everybody, stand back!

94
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,770
那是个什么玩意
What's that supposed to be?

95
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,460
这是一枚热能榴弹
This is a thermal detonator

96
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,990
我刚拉下了保险
that I just armed.

97
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,690
- 那是一个石头 - 不  不是
- That's a rock! - No, it's not.

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,560
就是石头
Yes, it is!

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,460
那咔嚓声
And you just made

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,220
是你用嘴发出来的
a clicking sound with your mouth.

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,980
别告诉我这就是你的计划
Please tell me this isn't your plan.

102
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,360
不 这才是...
No, this is.

103
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,120
- 上车 - 一辆M-68么
- Get in! - An M-68?

104
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,970
- 很不错吧 - 我喜欢
- Nice, right? - I love it!

105
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,780
我们坐从宝冠航空港
There's a starliner leaving from Coronet Spaceport,

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,050
起飞的星际航班
we're gonna be on it.

107
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,730
我们买通检查站的工作人员 然后就自由了
We bribe our way through the checkpoint, and we're free.

108
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,780
我要当飞行员
I'm gonna be a pilot.

109
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,250
我们可以买一艘属于自己的飞船
We can get our own ship.

110
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,170
我要飞遍整个银河系
See the galaxy, all of it.

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,980
以后我们再也不会受到任何人的摆布和欺负了
We won't have to take orders or be kicked around by anyone.

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
没错
Ever.

113
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,950
见鬼 他们这么快就追上来了
Thought we'd get a little more of a head start.

114
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,100
坐好
- Whoa! - Hang on!

115

规章制度

119
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,160
见鬼 那辆陆行艇好快
Damn! That stinger's fast.

120
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,630
是啊 我们更快 对吧
Yeah, but we're faster, right?

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,110
但愿如此
I hope so.

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,590
靠边停车
Pull over!

123
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,060
汉 我们过不去的
Han, no, we're not gonna make it!

124
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,840

Oh, yeah?

125
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,610
汉 不行 路太窄了

没有登机牌的旅客
Do not join the line

132
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,110

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,310
- 你跟紧我 - 下一位
- Just hold on to me. - Next.

148
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,380
不要回头
Don't look back.

149
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,930
一旦通过了我们可得想好
Once we're through, we've gotta be smart,

150
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,440
接下来要去哪
figure out where we're going.

151
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,460
只要不是帝国的领域就行
Anywhere the Empire isn't. Wherever we go,

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,970
哪里都不会比这差
it can't be worse than where we've been.

153
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,500
这可说不好 在那边我们不受保护
Yes, it can. Out there, we've got no protection.

154
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,670
我们可能会被人贩子抓住
We could get snatched up by traffickers,

155
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,240
卖给血红黎明或者赫特人集团
sold to Crimson Dawn or the Hutt Cartel.

156
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,400
我绝对不会
That's not gonna happen.

157
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,650
让这种事情发生的
I won't let it.

158
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,990
护身符
For luck?

159
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,690
没错
Damn right.

160
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,790
知道了 我们走
You heard him. Let's go.

161
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,020

身份证件
ID chips.

163
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,500
真不巧 我们忘带了
Funny thing, we don't have 'em.

164
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,860
我们有这个
We have this.

165
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,380
精炼超空间燃料
Refined hyperfuel.

166
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,350
它至少值八百个信用点
It's worth at least 800 credits, maybe more.

167
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,010
持有这个东西是违法的
You could be detained just for having that.

168
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,850
你为什么要这么严肃呢
What good would that do anybody?

169
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,920
让我们过去就是你的了
Let us through, it's all yours.

170
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,530
把核芯素交给我
The coaxium, now.

171
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,150
让我们通过就给你
As we're going through, not before.

172
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
给她
Do it.

173
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,850

全体注意 有人闯入
All units, there has been a breach.

189
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,980
还有一名非法旅客闯入了检查站
Another unauthorized traveler made it through the gate.

190
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,480
有人闯过关卡 去那边搜索
One got through the gate! Look over there!

191
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,650
有人闯过了检查站

00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,420
- 身份证给我看一下 - 求求你 不要

飞行员是在这里报名吧
This is where I sign up to be a pilot, right?

206
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,640
你可以申请加入帝国海军
If you apply for the Imperial Navy,

207
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,480
大多数新兵会加入陆军
but most recruits go into the infantry.

208
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,630

那要看你能不能服从命令
Depends on how good you are at following orders.

214
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,120
你想飞到哪里去呀

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,120
我没有家人 就我一个
I don't have people. I'm alone.

221
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,330
汉......
Han...

222
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,460

帝国现在需要你 前进 士兵们
Your Empire needs you. Troopers forward!

230

231
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,180
快到哪儿了 我们要去哪儿
Almost where? Where are we going?

232
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,140
只要越过最后一道山脊 胜利就...
Just over that last ridge. Victory is...

233
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,680
我的腿 我的腿
My legs! My leg!

234
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,080
嘿 贝克特 你说来这
Hey, Beckett, you said we were here

235
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,440
要干一票速战速决的
to pull a quick job.

236
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,420
- 是啊 - 这哪里是速战速决
- Yeah. - Well, this ain't a quick job!

237
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,860
这是持久战
It's a war!

238
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,420
你总是这么多废话
It's always something with you.

239
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,970
我们的目标是夺下步行机运输船
AT-hauler. That's what we came for.

240
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,390
前线指挥部一定是在这边
Forward operations must be this way.

241
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,060
没错 但少校说我们应该走这边
They are, but the major said we're supposed to go that way!

242
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,070
是啊 走那边送死吧
Yeah, go that way and die!

243
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,670
你说的对 少校已经死了
That's exactly what happened to the major!

244
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,010
现在谁是最高指挥官
Who's the ranking officer now?

245
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,740
是你 上尉
You are, Captain.

246
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,190
他说的没错呢
He's got you there.

247
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,560
有什么计划 贝克特上尉
So what's the plan, Captain Beckett?

248
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,920
瓦尔 你带里奥和这四个泥腿子包抄左翼
Val, you take Rio and these four mud skulls flank left.

249
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,510
我带上这个大嘴巴
I'll take this mouthy scooch

250
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,760
绕道右翼 然后...
and we'll go around to the right

251
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,990
没准我们运气好
and maybe we'll get lucky.

252
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,710
我们才不需要运气呢
Luck's got nothin' to do with it.

253
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,740
等等 一个问题 就一个问题
Wait! One question!

254
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,020
- 想活命吗 吉祥物 - 当然想了
- You wanna live, sparky? - Very much.

255
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,550
那就闭嘴 听从上尉的命令就行
Then shut up and do what your captain tells you.

256
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,840
我们冲
Let's go!

257
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,880
上尉
Captain.

258
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,230
T-15 报废了 我们走进去
T-15s are down. We walk from here.

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,390
上尉
Captain.

260
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,670
我是汉
I'm Han.

261
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,360
没兴趣听你介绍
Nobody cares.

262
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,900
刚才谢谢您 上尉
Thanks for your help back there.

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
你也不错
You did all right.

264
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,840
我接受过空战训练 所以...
I was trained in aerial combat...

265
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,790
想听我的建议吗
You want some advice?

266
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,050
赶紧离开这个鬼地方
Get the hell away from here.

267
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,630
不管去哪 越快越好
Any way you can, as fast as you can.

268
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,950
你指挥哪个连队
What company do you command?

269
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,720
跟你有什么关系么
None of your business company.

270
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,630
我们满员了
And we're full up.

271
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,020
当好你的兵 孩子
Stick to soldiering, kid.

272
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,500
别跟着我们
You don't want any part of this.

273
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,340
等等 兄弟们
Hang on, guys!

274
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,910

I want an advance party of ten men.

277
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,750
真棒 又能吃土了
Great, more mud.

278
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,950
你说什么
What was that?

279
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,800
我只是在想我们的目标是什么 上尉
Just wondering what our objective is, Lieutenant.

280
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,660

283
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,990
这里是他们的星球 我们才是敌人
It's their planet, we're the hostiles.

284
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,240
你有什么意见么 士兵
You got a problem, trooper?

285
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,800
没意见 长官
No problem, sir.

288
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,740
执行命令 出发
You heard 'em! Let's move out!

289
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,970
嗯 看起来他们每半小时
Mmm. Looks like they're running sorties

290
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,600
出动一次
every 30 minutes.

291
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,110
是呀 我们可以解决警戒线上的卫兵
Yeah, I can take out the guards at the perimeter,

292
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,460
信号兵 飞行员
signalman, pilot.

293
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,950
见鬼 都解决了吧
Hell, I'll just take 'em all out.

294
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,380
你们在看什么
What are we looking at?

295
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,960
你小子怎么有
You have a talent for sticking your nose in

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
多管闲事的习惯
where it doesn't belong.

297
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,010
我想不注意到都难
I just couldn't help but notice

298
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,320
我看你们穿着满是激光枪弹孔的军装
you're wearing a uniform pock-full of laser burns.

299
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,870
你们要么是刀枪不入
So either you heal real quick

300
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,050
要么就是穿着从死人身上扒下来的军装
or you stole it off a dead man.

301
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,230
你们不是帝国士兵
You're not Imperial Army.

302
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,730
你们像是偷军火的
You're thieves here to steal equipment

303
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,600
我要入伙
for a job and I want in.

304
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,030
- 我们崩了他算了 - 不
- Well, now we gotta shoot him. - No.

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,130
拧断脖子更干脆一些
Snap his neck. It's less mess.

306
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,550
或者你们带我走
Or you take me with you.

307
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,300
我从小就在克雷利亚星球的街头坑蒙拐骗
Look, I came up running scams on the streets of Corellia.

308
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,800
我十岁就开始偷AV-21
I was boosting AV-21s when I was ten.

309
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,680
我会开车 开飞船
I'm a driver, a flyer,

310
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,170
而且你自己也跟我说过 我得离开这 对吧
and hey, you said yourself. I gotta get outta here. Right?

311
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,740
这么棒的飞行员这么下来趟泥水了
What's a fancy flyboy doing down in the mud?

312
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,010
这个 因为我思想独立
I got kicked out of the Imperial Academy

313
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,600
所以被帝国飞行学院开除了
for having a mind of my own.

314
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,120
但我可是个很不错的飞行员 我要回到我的故乡
But I am a great pilot. And I gotta get home.

315
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,760
这家伙疯了 谁会想回克雷利亚啊
This guy is nuts. No one goes back to Corellia.

316
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,260
我回那自有我的原因
I got a reason.

317
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,420
我们有很棒的飞行员了
We've already got a great pilot.

318
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,050
这个阿迪尼亚人
The Ardennian.

319
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,220
阿迪尼亚人 你不想活了吗
Ardennian? You got a lot of nerve, pal.

320
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,690
我是一名帝国士兵
I'm an Imperial trooper.

321
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,930
真的吗 你屁股上
Oh, really? A couple of your arms

322
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,780
长了两只胳膊
popped out of your butt

323
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,550
把裤子撑长这么大 士兵
and hiked up your pants, trooper.

324
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,350
胡扯
Oh, yeah?

325
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,790
听着 无论如何我要回克雷利亚
Look, I'll do whatever it takes to get back to Corellia.

326
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,050
我等不起了
I've already been away too long.

327
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,010
给个机会 谢谢您 长官
Just give me a shot.

328
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,750
等等  等等
Whoa. Hold it.

329
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,240
好吧 如果您对我没什么兴趣
Well, if you're not interested in me,

330
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
那中尉应该会对你非常感兴趣
I think the lieutenant might be very interested in you.

331
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,350
你威胁我
Blackmail.

332
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,760
中尉
Lieutenant.

333
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,780
上尉
Captain.

334
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,340
中尉 我们逮捕了一名逃兵
Lieutenant, we have apprehended a deserter.

335
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,280
把他带走
Take him.

336
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,110
我说 等一下
Wait.

337
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,120
我就知道 你小子不是个好东西
I should've known. This one's a troublemaker.

338
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,360
他还是个骗子 他说的话可别信
And a liar. Don't believe anything he says.

339
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,490
- 别丢下我 - 快点带走
- Don't go anywhere without me. - All right, let's go.

340
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,770
把他喂野兽
Feed him to the beast.

341
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,500
野兽 这有野兽吗
The beast? Wait, there's a beast?

342
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,750
- 等等 - 快走
- Hold on! - Move it!

343
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,000
那家伙是冒名顶替的
Listen, that guy's not even an officer. All right?

344
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,300
- 他在说谎 - 闭嘴
- He was lying! - Quiet!

345
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,170
我懒得管
Don't care.

346
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,820
有三天没喂他了
Haven't fed him in three days.

347
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,050
有好看的了
Should be fun.

348
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,050
大个子
Oh! Hey! Hey, big fella.

349
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,800
冷静一点 放松
Just calm down. Take it easy.

350
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,400
咱俩是一伙的
We're on the same side.

351
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,150
想吃点什么
You like treats?

352
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,200
救命 让我离开这
Help! Let me out of here!

353
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,410
让我离开这
Let me out of here!

354
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,550
抓住你了
A-ha! Gotcha!

355
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,250
感觉越来越精彩啊
Ah, this was just getting good.

356
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,630
它杀得太快了 对
- He killed him too fast. - Yeah!

357
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,970
慢点杀他
Kill him slower.

358
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,210
等等等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

359
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,820
等等......
Wait! Wait!

360
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,660
我会说一点伍基话
Yeah, I speak a little.

361
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,620
你听我说...
Now just listen to me, you...

362
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,990
对对对
Yes, yes!

363
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,900
不不不
No, no, no, no!

364
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
来吧
Do it!

365
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,020
来啊
Come on.

366
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,390
不
Oh, no!

367
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,570
赌十个信用点 他活不过一分钟
Ten credits, he doesn't last another minute.

368
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,470
让我离开这里
Let me out of here!

369
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,270
我实在是受不了了
I can't take it anymore!

370
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,510
不 住手  求你了
- Oh, no! Stop, please! - That's it. Get him!

371
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,270
你没劲了 你这肮脏的卡西克挤奶工
You tired, you mangy Kashyyykian moof-milker?

372
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,020
听我的 没错吧
See what happens when you listen to me?

373
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,010
你要干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

374
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,230
跟我来
Follow me!

375
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,530
等等过来
Wait, wait.

376
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,470
听我说 听我说
Come here. Listen to me.

377
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,460
你不明白
You don't understand, okay?

378
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,410
我有一群好朋友
I have some very good friends

379
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,550
在那个机场等我
waiting for me at that airfield.

380
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,990
他们马上要走了
They're leaving right now.

381
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,710
离开这里就靠他们了
That's our one way off this mud ball.

382
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,380
如果你想活命我们走那边
If you wanna live, we go that way.

383
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,890
然后你爱去哪去哪 我不管
After that, you go whichever way you want, I don't care!

384
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,040
但是现在 快往那边走
But right now, that's the way you go!

385
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,800
相信我
Trust me!

386
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,760
瓦尔 我们走
Val, let's go!

387
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,000
他们穿这玩意是怎么呼吸的 太闷了
How do they breathe in these suits? It's so stuffy!

388
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,960
怪不得他们飞行技术的那么烂
No wonder they're such lousy pilots.

389
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,670
没法转头 没法呼吸
You can't turn your head, you can't breathe,

390
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,100
听不到队友说什么
you can't hear each other!

391
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,550
活见鬼了
I'll be damned.

392
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,050
看谁回来了
Hey, look who's back!

393
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,360
简直难以置信
Unbelievable!

394
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,180
等等
Wait!

395
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,070
等一下
Wait!

396
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,750
那是一个伍基人吗 不可思议
Whoa, is that a Wookiee? Incredible!

397
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,110
实话实说
I'll say it, I don't care.

398
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,690
我开始喜欢这孩子了
This kid's growing on me.

399
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,660
等等
Wait!

400
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,310
干这种活
You know, we could always use

401
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,370
多几个帮手总会有用的
some muscle on a job like this.

402
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,390
别打这主意
Don't even think about it!

403
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,820
我跟你讲 躺在伍基人的膝盖上睡觉
I'm telling you, you will never have a deeper sleep

404
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,580
是件非常惬意的事情
than curled up in a Wookiee's lap.

405
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,200
我跟你说过了
I told you!

406
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,330
非常好的朋友
Very good friends!

407
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,960
这种事情不能一个一个来吗
We couldn't have done this maybe, like, one at a time?

408
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,860
真得感谢你帮我离开那里
Thanks for helping me get outta there.

409
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,150
都是因为我 他们才带上你
No, they only took you because of me.

410
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,230
我跟他们做了一笔非常棒的交易
I got us a real sweet deal here.

411
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,280
只要跟他们一起干上一票
We do this one job with them,

412
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,190
我们赚上一大笔钱
we make some real money,

413
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,390
然后我们就自由了
and then we're free.

414
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,540
你多久没有享受过自由了
When's the last time you could say that?

415
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,240
我也很久没自由过了
Been a while for me, too.

416
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,970
那么你叫什么名字
So what's your name, anyway?

417
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,740
丘巴卡
Chewbacca?

418
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,120
这个名字...我得给你起个外号
All right, well, you're gonna need a nickname,

419
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,940
不然喊你的名字太麻烦了
'cause I ain't saying that every time.

420
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,200
他来了 你看一下
Here it comes. Take a look.

421
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,820
列车走到塔和桥中间的时候 我们就动手
We hit the Conveyex between the tower and the bridge.

422
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,060
里奥送我们上去 我们拆下货箱
Rio drops us in, we separate the payload container,

423
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,690
把它吊在步行运输机上 然后...
cable it up to the AT-hauler and then...

424
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,580
里奥干扰他们的报警信号
Rio jams their distress signal.

425
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,360
我炸毁桥
I blow the bridge,

426
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,300
然后从轨道上把车厢吊走
the container slides right off the track

427
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,750
我们一走了之
and we sail away.

428
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,550
如果触发报警信号
You trip that security beam,

429
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,720
激活了蝮蛇机器人
wake up those Vipers,

430
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,180
那情况就会变得非常危险
it's liable to get real spicy, real fast.

431
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,360
你需要担心的人可不是我
Well, I'm not the one you should be worried about.

432
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,860
恩菲斯·内斯特
Enfys Nest.

433
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,320
恩菲斯·奈斯特是谁
What's an Enfys Nest?

434
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,490
我跟你说过 我们干的这一票
I told you, we're way ahead

435
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,310
不会有人插手的
of the competition on this one.

436
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,570
恩菲斯·内斯特甚至不知道
There's no way Enfys Nest

437
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,670
这批货运输的消息
even knows about this shipment.

438
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
只有我那边的人知道这消息
Only my guy has the intel.

439
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,970
那你的人最好别出差错
Well, you better be right. Yeah?

440
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,180
因为有的时候
Because sometimes, you put your faith

441
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,600
你也会看错人
in the wrong people.

442
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,330
我们的未来都压在这一票上
Our whole future depends on this one score

443
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,690
你却带上两个生手
and you bring in amateurs.

444
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,970
可能你没注意到
In case you hadn't noticed,

445
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,650
我们真的缺人手
we're a little shorthanded.

446
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,170
那就去找啊
So we get who we need.

447
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,700
扎恩姐妹 或者是博斯克 你偏不找他们
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

448
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,030
你把咱俩的命放在
But, no, instead you're putting our lives

449
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,650
两个傻瓜的手上
in the hands of morons.

450
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,020
你俩傻吗
You guys morons?

451
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,910
不
No!

452
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,100
- 听见了 不 - 我们俩一点不傻
- No. See? - We're not morons.

453
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,110
我一直在等待一个这样的机会
Look, I waited a long time for a shot like this.

454
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,960
我不会搞砸的
I'm not about to screw it up, all right?

455
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,920
哦 好了 瓦尔
Oh, come on, Val!

456
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,590
你看他多真诚啊
He looks so sincere.

457
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,010
再说拒绝
Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite

458
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,140
一个伍基人
a Wookiee to anything?

459
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,710
后果可一点都不好
Not a good idea!

460
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,100
这一点也不好笑
This is not funny!

461
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,630
听着 直觉告诉我 他们两个靠得住
Look, now, I have great instincts about these guys.

462
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,540
再说了 我们还有其他选择吗
And, besides, do you see any other options?

463
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,930
希望你自己心里有数
I just hope you know what you're doing.

464
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,730
我很清楚我为什么要这么做
Yeah, I know exactly what I'm doing and why.

465
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,630
我们要把债还清
We're gonna clear our debts,

466
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,580
返回格利安塞姆
go back to Glee Anselm,

467
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,300
我要学会弹梵弦琴
and I'm finally gonna learn how to play that valachord.

468
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,510
哦 宝贝儿 你永远也学不会弹梵弦琴
Babe, you're never gonna learn how to play the valachord.

469
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,380
说的对 你是个音痴
She's right. You are tone-deaf.

470
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,310
你遇到过什么伤心事 小飞哥
So what's your sob story, flyboy?

471
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,220
你问我么
Who, me?

472
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
我看的出你心里有事
You're after something, I know the look.

473
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,960
是不是要报仇
What is it? Revenge?

474
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,430
不 不是报仇
No, it's not revenge.

475
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,020
你看他
Look at him.

476
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,710
肯定是因为一个姑娘
If it's anything, it's a girl.

477
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,730
哦 姑娘
Oh, a girl!

478
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,340
跟我们讲讲她 汉 她人怎么样
Tell us about the girl, Han. Is she nice?

479
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,590
她有尖尖的牙吗
Does she have sharp teeth?

480
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,080
以前有那么一个女孩
There was a girl.

481
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,710
当时我逃出来了 而她没有
But I got out, she didn't.

482
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,430
我发誓要成为一名飞行员
I swore to myself I'd become a pilot,

483
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
弄艘船
get a ship,

484
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,910
回去找到她
go back and find her.

485
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,800
干完这票后就去找她
That's what I'm gonna do right after this job.

486
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,910
你怎么知道她还呆在那儿
How you know she'll still be there?

487
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,430
我就是知道
I just know.

488
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,850
我可不想被任何人束缚住
Personally, I refuse to be tied down

489
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,050
追我的人可多着呢
by anyone, though many have tried.

490
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,920
得了吧 里奥 别逗了
Come on, Rio. You don't fool me.

491
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,770
人都需要有个伴
Everybody needs somebody.

492
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,290
即便是你这个老骗子也不例外
Even a broken down old crook like this one.

493
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,000
你分到钱后 打算干嘛去
How about you? What are you gonna do with your share?

494
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,250
他说什么
What was he saying?

495
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,690
他说伍基人
He said the Wookiees were enslaved

496
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,260
被帝国奴役 远离家乡
by the Empire, taken off Kashyyyk.

497
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,280
他好像在寻找他的…
He's searching for his, uh...

498
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,720
我不知道是他说的是部落还是家人
I don't know if he said tribe or family.

499
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,370
有区别吗
What's the difference?

500
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,000
教我怎么做
Show me how to do that.

501
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,410
你唯一需要学会的是…
The only thing you need to learn to do

502
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,730
按我说的去做
is do what I say when I say it.

503
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,810
明天这个时候
And this time tomorrow,

504
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,090
你就有足够的钱
you'll have more than enough

505
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,530
买一艘飞船了
to buy your own ship.

506
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,780
现在开始计时
Starting the clock.

507
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,520
正在干扰信号 距离大桥9.6
Jamming their signal. 9.6 to the bridge.

508
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,960
拿出你们的真本事来 伙计们
Let's find out how good we really are, folks.

509
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,560
我没事儿
I'm fine!

510
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,550
瓦尔 你那边情况如何
Val, how's it going up there?

511
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,860
一切顺利
Never better.

512
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,420
核芯素
Coaxium.

513
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,750
足够一支舰队用的
Enough to power a fleet!

514
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,290
也可以把我们炸的粉身碎骨
Or blow us all straight to hell!

515
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,260
好的 告诉我
All right, talk to me.

516
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,700
今天是好日子吗
Is it a good day?

517
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,510
堪称完美
It's a great day!

518
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,110
你生命最好的一天 贪心鬼
Best day of your life, my grabby friend!

519
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,310
难说 你从没有在阿迪尼亚
I don't know, you've never been

520
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,140
享受过迈诺克烧烤
to a Mynock roast on Ardennia.

521
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,280
那才绝呢
It's nuts!

522
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,100
他们来了
Here they come!

523
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,890
断开车厢连接器
Get down to the couplers!

524
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,490
里奥 后撤
Rio, fall back!

525
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,870
他们反应还挺快的
Well, that didn't take 'em long.

526
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,140
丘伊
Chewie!

527
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,240
你没事儿吧
You all right?

528
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,080
你差点就挂了 兄弟
Little close there, buddy!

529
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,220
汉 怎么还没好
Han, what's the holdup?

530
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,340
我们一起来
All right, together.

531
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,160
用力
Now!

532
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,150
好了
All right!

533
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,490
他们解开一边儿了 你在哪儿呢 伙计
They got one uncoupled. Where are you, buddy?

534
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,390
我正在规划退休生活
Just up here planning my retirement.

535
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,680
在考虑某个温暖又不太热的地方
Thinking about opening a cantina

536
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,050
开个小酒馆呢
somewhere warm but not too warm, you know?

537
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,460
快把绳索放出来
Lowering the winch cables now!

538
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,260
我就知道 我早说了 贝克特
I knew it! I told him! Beckett!

539
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,500
他来了
He's coming!

540
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,540
见鬼 这回要被她唠叨个没完了
Damn it! I'm never gonna hear the end of this!

541
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,520
那是谁
Who's that?

542
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,110
恩菲斯·内斯特
Enfys Nest!

543
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,910
土匪 海盗
Marauders, pirates.

544
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,740
想来从我们嘴里抢吃的
Come to snake the score from under us.

545
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,500
准备发射缆绳
Ready your harpoons.

546
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
冲上去
Move in.

547
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,400
等一下 我这里有位不速之客
Hang on! I got an uninvited guest.

548
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,850
从我的船里滚出去
Get off of my ship!

549
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,910
你还好吗 兄弟
You still with us, brother?

550
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,870
噢 我还好
Yeah, I'm okay.

551
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,930
就是一边的肩膀划破了 没什么
Just nicked one of my shoulders. It's nothing.

552
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,710
他一点都不好
He's not okay.

553
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,330
丘伊
Chewie!

554
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,700
得靠你一个人解开这边了
You gotta uncouple this one on your own!

555
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,470
汉
Han!

556
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,790
我知道了
I'm on it!

557
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,490
瓦尔
Val!

558
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,480
眼睛睁大点 我们触发了一个传感器
Keep your eyes open. We just tripped a sensor.

559
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,530
蝮蛇机器人朝你们去了
Viper droids headed your way!

560
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,700
里奥
Rio?

561
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,910
嗯 情况不妙
Yeah, it looks worse than it is.

562
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,670
得包扎一下
Just gotta patch it up.

563
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,080
也许得小睡一会
Maybe rest my eyes for a minute.

564
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,250
够了 我自己来
Enough! I'm going in.

565
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,950
你没撒谎 小伙子
You weren't lying, kid.

566
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,990
技术真不赖
You're a hell of a pilot.

567
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,390
里奥 伙计 挺住
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

568
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,330
贝克特 我们有一根缆绳断了
Beckett, we just lost a cable!

569
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,310
距离大桥2.1
2.1 to the bridge!

570
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,050
一个人死真没劲 小伙子
It's no good to die alone, kid.

571
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,060
瓦尔说得对
Val was right.

572
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,820
里奥
Rio?

573
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,320
贝克特 距离大桥0.8
Beckett, we're .8 from the bridge!

574
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,520
瓦尔还在轨道上
Val's still on the track!

575
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,420
瓦尔你快离开那座桥
Val, you gotta get off that bridge!

576
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,330
我们来了
We're here!

577
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,530
它们把我困在这了
They got me pinned!

578
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,750
我得在这里动手了
I'm gonna have to finish the job from right here.

579
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,390
什么
What?

580
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,070
我不虚此生 宝贝
It's been a ride, babe.

581
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,640
跟你在一起的日子是我最珍贵的一段时光
And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

582
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,370
瓦尔
Val!

583
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
不
No!

584
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,520
不
No!

585
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,980
丘伊 快
Chewie, now!

586
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,530
贝克特 我拉不过他们
Beckett, I can't pull it away from 'em.

587
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,660
他们会放手的 你尽管飞
They'll let go, you fly straight!

588
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,530
快松开缆绳
Release your cables

589
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,010
要不然就要死了
or die!

590
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,990
我们太近了
We're too close.

591
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,120
我得松开
I gotta release.

592
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,600
照我说的做 汉
You do what I tell you, Han!

593
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,050
丘伊 抓住缆绳
Chewie, grab the line!

594
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,480
不许断开
Don't you do it!

595
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,980
汉
Han!

596
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,580
你这个懦夫
You coward!

597
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,690
你干什么
What the hell?

598
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,420
你不听话 也不服从命令
You don't listen and you can't follow orders!

599
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,880
你知不知道你都干了什么
You have any idea what you've done?

600
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,790
偷这批货不是为了我们自己
We were not stealing for ourselves,

601
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,410
我们是受雇于血红黎明的
we were hired by Crimson Dawn.

602
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,030
血红黎明
Crimson Dawn?

603
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,390
我们欠了他们100千克的精炼核芯素
Now we owe them 100 keys of refined coaxium.

604
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,590
要是他们发现我们没把东西弄到手
When they find out we don't got it,

605
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,660
就会杀了我们
they're gonna kill us.

606
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,350
对
Right.

607
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,780
赶紧逃
We run.

608
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,690
我已经是个逃兵了 没什么区别了
I'm already a deserter. What's the difference?

609
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,030
你说区别
The difference

610
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,690
如果你是一名逃兵
is the Empire doesn't send out

611
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,020
帝国可不会派出一队杀手
a team of enforcers to hunt you down

612
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,540
去追杀你
when you're a deserter.

613
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,060
可德赖登·沃斯会
Dryden Vos will.

614
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,150
你知道有人悬赏
You have any idea what it's like

615
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,090
要你的命是什么感觉吗
to live with a price on your head?

616
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,340
你唯一能做的就是请罪
The only thing to do is to go to them.

617
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,800
也许我能想个办法来补偿他
Maybe I can find some way to make it up to him.

618
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,800
那就按你说的来
Then that's what we do.

619
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
不好吧
No.

620
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,300
他们认识我 不认识你
He knows me, not you.

621
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,650
如果你跟着我一起过去
If you come with me

622
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,590
一旦露面
and show your face,

623
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,430
哪怕他们留你一命
if they don't kill you,

624
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,090
你这辈子就得一直干这行了
you're in this life for good.

625
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,180
如果你能想个办法解决这件事
You find some way to square this,

626
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,960
我们还能拿到钱吗
we still get our money?

627
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,160
也许吧
Maybe.

628
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,980
那我们就值得为之冒险
For me, it's worth the risk.

629
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,650
你觉得呢
How about you?

630
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,490
他同意了
That's yes.

631
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,600
抱歉 我刚打了你一拳
Sorry I punched your face.

632
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,990
挨揍这种事对我来说是家常便饭了
Happens more often than you think.

633
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,010
我们上去之后
So when we get up there,

634
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,290
德赖登·沃斯就在伊普索堡等我们么
Dryden Vos is waiting for us at Fort Ypso?

635
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,440
他的船就在附近
Nearby, on his yacht.

636
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,510
你知道船在哪吗
You're gonna know how to find it?

637
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,160
那根本不成问题
That won't be a problem.

638
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,110
把你们的武器交出来
I'll need to check your weapons.

639
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,950
我就剩这一件武器了
That's all I got left.

640
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,360
我来找德赖登 他在等着见我
I'm here to see Dryden. He's expecting me.

641
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,790
他马上来见你
He'll be with you shortly.

642
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,950
他和区域总督的会面刚刚结束
He's just finishing with the regional governor.

643
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,470
打扰 长官
Excuse me, sir.

644
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,530
说
Yes.

645
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,510
贝克特到了
- Beckett has arrived. - Oh.

646
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,210
把这放我办公室 待会可能要用
Put this in my office. I might be needing it later.

647
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,200
我发什么火嘛 真是的
I get all worked up. Silly.

648
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,770
这可是宴会 应该开心一点
It's a party.

649
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,560
这里的人可不是你朋友
These people are not your friends

650
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,310
你永远都不可能成为他们的朋友 所以别跟任何人说话
and they're never gonna be, so don't talk to any of 'em.

651
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,520
所以眼睛也别乱瞟
Don't look at anybody,

652
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,350
把头低下看路
just keep your eyes down.

653
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,690
我得去喝一杯
I might get a drink.

654
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,950
不 好吧 随便
No, yeah, whatever.

655
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,780
丘伊 你能不能...
Chewie, would you please...

656
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,660
琦拉 你怎么在这
Qi'ra, what are you doing here?

657
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,020
我在这工作
I work here.

658
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,060
你怎么在这
What's your excuse?

659
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,390
我 我
My... I...

660
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,060
琦 琦拉...我...
Qi'ra, I was...

661
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,770
我正想着回去找你呢
I was coming back for you.

662
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,290
那些日子都过去了 汉
It's in the past, Han.

663
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:05,920
我可不这么想
Not for me.

664
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,890
我来到这
The only reason I'm here,

665
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,490
就是想做份工作赚一点钱
I was doing this job, get a little money

666
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,230
然后回克雷利亚去找你
and then I was gonna come back to Corellia and find you.

667
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,380
现在你不必了
Well, now you don't have to.

668
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,380
我就站在你面前
I'm right in front of you.

669
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,890
那天
That day...

670
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,640
有时候我经常在想
Sometimes, a lot of times, I think...

671
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,940
如果你留下...
If you'd have stayed,

672
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,220
他们会杀了你的
they would've killed you.

673
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,650
你能逃走 我很高兴
I'm glad you got out.

674
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,390
你是怎么脱身的
How did you get out?

675
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,020
我没有脱身
I didn't.

676
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,980
你气色不错
You look good.

677
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,760
有一点不修边幅
A little rough around the edges,

678
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,160
但挺精神
but good.

679
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,800
你也是
You too.

680
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,740
谢谢 奥蒂莉
Thank you, Ottilie.

681
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,370
你在关注多克·昂达吗
Have you been attentive to Dok-Ondar?

682
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,440
当然
Very.

683
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,920
我们为什么举杯呢
What should we drink to?

684
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,170
不管为什么 先喝两杯在说
Let's drink two and see where it goes.

685
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,860
你弄到那艘可以让我们远走高飞的船了吗
Did you ever get that ship we were going to fly away on?

686
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,050
快了 也差不多
Yeah. Sort of.

687
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,400
马上吧 所以我来这儿是准备...
About to. That's why I'm here.

688
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,780
我正在做一笔
I'm working on a...

689
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,730
大买卖
Very big deal.

690
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,890
有多大
How big?

691
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,090
非常大
Enormous.

692
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,670
真的假的 那你什么时候搞定这笔大买卖
Really? And when are you going to close this enormous deal?

693
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,360
可能下一秒就搞定了
Any minute.

694
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,040
我经常想起你
I thought about you a lot.

695
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,320
你在某个地方冒险
Off somewhere, some adventure.

696
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,450
我想像自己在你身边 那样总能让我...
I imagined myself with you. It always made me...

697
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,180
- 什么 - 嘿
- What? - Hey.

698
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,300
我怎么跟你说的
What did I say?

699
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,390
听着 我不可能一直低着头
Look, I can't keep my eyes down the whole time.

700
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,870
那样我会撞上东西的
I'm gonna bump into something.

701
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,210
我说别跟任何人说话 你怎么...
But I told you not to talk to anyone.

702
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
贝克特
Beckett.

703
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,030
等等 你们在一起做事
Wait. You two work together?

704
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,410
- 对 - 托拜厄斯
- Yeah. - Tobias!

705
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,050
德赖登
Dryden.

706
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,100
你好吗 有没有受伤
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

707
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,970
没有 我很好
No, I'm fine.

708
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,690
瓦尔的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry to hear about Val.

709
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,150
谢谢你 但是...
Yeah, I appreciate that.

710
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,490
我们没想到会...
But there was no way we could've anticipated...

711
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,060
我想我们俩没见过面吧
I don't believe we've been introduced.

712
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,100
对 这是汉·索罗和丘巴卡
Yeah. This is Han Solo and Chewbacca.

713
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,700
他们是跟我一起的
They're with me.

714
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,430
我是德赖登·沃斯
I'm Dryden Vos.

715
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:27,290
看来你们已经见过我的高级助理了...
I see you've already met my top lieutenant.

716
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,910
汉和我一起在科雷利亚长大
Han and I grew up together on Corellia.

717
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
一个窝出来的
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

718
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,430
我钦佩那些那些靠自己爬出下水道的人
I admire anyone who can crawl their way out of the sewer.

719
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:41,350
尤其是像科雷利亚那样肮脏的下水道
Especially, a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

720
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,410
臭烘烘的 我说的对吧
The stench, am I right?

721
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,050
很高兴见到你
Well, it's good to have you.

722
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,960
欢迎
Welcome.

723
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,340
你也是 丘巴卡 欢迎
And you, too, Chewbacca, welcome.

724
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,040
好了 我们少吃点儿 多喝点儿
All right, let's eat a little, drink a lot,

725
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,390
然后私下聊聊
and talk privately.

726
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,990
他们只是朋友
We're just friends, all right?

727
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:02,920
你太敏感了
You're touchy.

728
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,480
贝克特 你给我出了一个大难题
Beckett, you have put me in a terrible position.

729
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,610
我知道 德赖登 我非常抱歉
I know, Dryden, and I am sorry.

730
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,600
你很抱歉
You're sorry?

731
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,100
德赖登 事情很复杂
Dryden, there were complications.

732
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,890
有些原因
There were factors.

733
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,310
恩菲斯·内斯特 一直都在找我们的麻烦
Enfys Nest has been a constant irritation forever.

734
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,920
你应该能预料到这个情况的
It's one you should've anticipated,

735
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,480
你应该能解决这个的
it's one you should've dealt with.

736
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,970
我知道我犯了个错误
Trust me, I know I made a mistake,

737
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,960
但是你雇我的时候
but when you hired me, you told me

738
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
你跟我说没有其他人知道
no one else had this information...

739
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,350
够了
Test me!

740
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,320
你敢再啰嗦一个字试试看
Test me one more time, you'll see what happens.

741
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,780
我认为德赖登想说的是
I think what Dryden is trying to say

742
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,710
我们没兴趣知道 你为什么现在没拿到货
is that we're not interested in why you don't have it.

743
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,770
对 我不感兴趣
No, I'm not interested.

744
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,580
我一点儿都不感兴趣
I'm not interested at all.

745
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:40,840
德赖登
Dryden,

746
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,820
我该怎么做才能挽回这一切
what can I do to make this right?

747
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,730
挽回这一切
"Make this right?"

748
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,190
没什么可以挽回的
There is no making this right.

749
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,730
你知道我老板是谁
You know who I answer to

750
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,080
你也知道他对我有什么期待
and you know what he'll expect of me.

751
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,220
他会说 你必须承担后果
He'll say, "There have to be consequences."

752
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,940
所以接下来我需要你做一件事
So here's what I need you to do for me.

753
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,610
我需要你给我一个...
I need you to give me a reason

754
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,710
不杀你们的理由
not to kill you all.

755
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,670
因为我一定会对你作出补偿
Because I will make it up to you.

756
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,950
不 怎么补 你怎么补偿我
No, no, no. How?

757
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,240
我会遵守之前的约定
How will you make it up to me?

758
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,640
把货交给你
By delivering exactly what was promised.

759
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,300
还是100千克精炼核芯素吗
100 k-grams of refined coaxium?

760
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,740
是的 我们会从其它的地方给你偷来
Yes. We will simply steal it from somewhere else.

761
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,170
从什么地方
From where?

762
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,380
除了帝国仓库
You'll be hard pushed to find that

763
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,060
你很难在其他地方找到核芯素
anywhere outside an Imperial vault.

764
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,050
斯卡里夫 或者仁慈岛
Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island.

765
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,390
那是不可能的
That's impossible.

766
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,090
所以我们想想其它办法
So, let's come up with some other options.

767
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,450
其它能让我们...
Other ideas that we might...

768
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,360
没有精炼的行不行
What about unrefined?

769
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,560
唯一已知的 不稳定核芯素来源
Well, the only known source of astatic coaxium

770
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,560
是科舍尔星球香料矿的地下裂缝
is a fissure vent beneath the spice mines on Kessel.

771
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,790
对 我想的就是这里
Yeah. That's the one I was thinking of.

772
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,420
那个来源地非常棒
That's a very, very good one.

773
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,720
但是科舍尔由派克人控制着
But see, the Pykes control Kessel.

774
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,790
血红黎明与派克人
Crimson Dawn maintains

775
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,130
保持着脆弱的同盟关系
a fragile alliance with the Pykes.

776
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,490
我不能破坏这关系
It's one that I can't jeopardize

777
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,620
不然就会引起全面的帮派冲突
without risking an all-out war with the Syndicates,

778
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,800
所以听着 先生们 我绝不会同意
and that, gentlemen, I will not do.

779
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,600
那么如果没有其他提议 我们的谈话到此为止
So, if that's all you have, I think we're done here.

780
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,460
我们还有话要说
Not all we have.

781
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,490
我们跟派克人可没有同盟关系
We don't have any alliance with the Pykes.

782
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,960
对 没人知道我们是为你效力的
Right, so nobody is gonna know we're working for you.

783
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,950
有可能成功么
Possible?

784
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:21,680
有风险
It's risky.

785
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,380
一旦将没加工的核芯素取出仓库
As soon as the raw coaxium is removed from the vault,

786
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,030
它会变得不稳定
it starts to destabilize,

787
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,670
所以除非
so unless...

788
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,200
除非
Unless...

789
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,800
除非...
Unless...

790
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,550
配合一下嘛
Work with me here.

791
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,340
除非你能找个地方
Unless you could find somewhere

792
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,040
马上对它进行精炼
to get it processed fast.

793
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,530
那个...
Well...

794
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,880
他说萨瓦林
He's saying Savareen?

795
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,230
萨瓦林
Savareen.

796
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,140
对 那儿有一个老旧的精炼厂
Yeah, it's an old refinery there

797
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,330
那地方不受帝国的管辖
and it's not under Imperial jurisdiction.

798
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,070
琦拉说得对
But Qi'ra's right.

799
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,560
在你们抵达前储藏罐就会爆炸 所以...
The canisters will explode before you get there,

800
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,940
你们需要 一艘非常快的船
so you'd need an incredibly fast ship

801
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,650
和一流的飞行员
and a brilliant pilot.

802
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,300
我们会找到船的
We'll find a ship.

803
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,010
飞行员已经有了
We've already got the pilot.

804
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,460
他很傲慢 也很有野心
He is arrogant and he's hungry.

805
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,450
你怎么看 亲爱的
So what do you think, my dear?

806
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:14,250
你觉得你的这位朋友 能胜任这次任务吗
You think your friend here can do what needs to be done?

807
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,740
是的 我觉得他可以
Yes, I believe he can.

808
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,640
这是个好消息
Well, that is good news,

809
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,640
因为你要跟着他
because you're going with him

810
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,200
确保他做到
to see that he does.

811
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,420
好吗
All right?

812
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:35,650
没问题
Of course.

813
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,830
好的
All right.

814
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,540
我们萨瓦林见
I'll see you all on Savareen.

815
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,670
萨瓦林见
Savareen it is.

816
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,510
- 我很看好这个方案 - 我也是
- I feel great about this plan. - Me, too.

817
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,240
我们应该常聊聊 很有意思
We should do this again. It's been fun.

818
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,290
是啊
Great.

819
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,950
对了 还有一件事儿
Oh, just one more thing.

820
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,290
如果你们再让我失望
If you do fail me again,

821
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,480
那就没办法了
we'll all be out of options.

822
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,150
对吧
Right?

823
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,220
你放心吧
We won't.

824
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,070
一切进行得挺顺利的
So, I thought that went really well.

825
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,360
我们尽量快点解决这件事
Let's get this done as quick and as clean as possible.

826
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,250
你们需要什么
What do you need?

827
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,010
装备我有办法弄来
I can scrounge up the gear.

828
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,520
你能弄到船吗
Do you got a line on a ship?

829
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,760
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

830
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,480
我知道能去哪儿找到他
And I know just where to find him.

831
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,540
不是很有希望 但值得一试
It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.

832
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:16,910
他是最厉害的走私犯
He's the best smuggler around.

833
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,060
他从帝国的追捕中逃脱的次数
He's slipped through the Empire's fingers

834
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,200
比任何走私犯都要多
more times than anyone else.

835
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,010
他很有魅力
He's attractive, too.

836
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:23,970
他久经世故
Sophisticated,

837
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,780
品味超凡 而且风流倜傥
with impeccable taste and... Charisma.

838
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,880
更不用说他那惊人的...
Not to mention his prodigious...

839
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,960
知道了
We get it.

840
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,730
不过他现在已经金盆洗手了 他说自己是个职业玩家
But he's retired. Says he's a sportsman now.

841
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,490
我们只需要他的船
All we need is his ship.

842
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,310
他的船从不外借
Well, he'll never part with it.

843
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,500
他爱死那艘船了
He loves that ship.

844
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,970
那是他
He won it

845
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,640
玩萨巴卡牌赢来的
playing Sabacc.

846
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,920
那么问题来了
And there's the rub, right?

847
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,040
我怎么知道她是个帝国间谍
How was I supposed to know she was an Imperial spy?

848
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,230
我以为她爱我呢
I thought she loved me.

849
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,770
就是那家伙
That's the guy, huh?

850
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,320
是个有趣的家伙
An interesting style.

851
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,600
我同意
I'll say.

852
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,520
你说他的船是赢来的
You say he won his ship?

853
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,640
你的表情出卖了你 我决定跟你了
You have an awful Sabacc face. I'm gonna call it.

854
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,280
我能赢他 我跟他赌
I can take him. Let me at him.

855
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,740
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

856
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,810
汉 这群人是职业赌徒
Han, these guys are serious gamblers.

857
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,960
我也挺专业的 给我点赌注
I'm serious. Stake me.

858
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,370
别听他瞎说
Don't listen to him.

859
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,830
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

860
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,600
各位让我赢一局如何
You see, how'd you guys let me beat you on that one?

861
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
来吧
Come on.

862
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,040
今天没有骗子只有玩家
There's no liars in this game, just players.

863
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,630
这个座位没人吧
Is this seat taken?

864
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,060
没人坐就是没人 朋友
If nobody's in the seat, then it ain't taken, friend.

865
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,620
这就是...斯巴克
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

866
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,770
萨巴卡
Sabacc.

867
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,400
萨巴卡 对
Sabacc. Got it.

868
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,650
你玩过吗
You play it before?

869
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,430
玩过几次
A couple times, yeah.

870
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,400
我是兰多·卡瑞辛船长
Captain Lando Calrissian.

871
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,250
汉·索罗
Han Solo.

872
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,180
看来你今天手气不错呀
Looks like you're having a good day.

873
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,460
我运气好
I'm a lucky guy.

874
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,250
我能问你个问题吗 卡瑞辛船长
Can I ask you a question, Captain Calrissian?

875
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,800
随便问 憨
Anything, Han.

876
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,470
我叫汉 不过没关系
That's "Han", but that's okay.

877
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:09,110
我听到过一些关于你的故事 想知道是不是真的
I heard a story about you. I was wondering if it's true.

878
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:13,860
你听到的所有关于我的故事 都是真的
Everything you've heard about me is true.

879
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:14,990
谢谢宝贝儿
Thanks, love.

880
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,320
你的船是玩牌赢来的吗
Did you win your ship playing cards?

881
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,910
我赢过很多东西
Oh, I've won a lot of things.

882
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,560
我在奥西恩星带赢过一颗亚热带卫星
I once won a subtropical moon in the Oseon Belt.

883
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,770
哇
Wow.

884
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,900
结果是个赔钱货
Turned out to be a real money pit.

885
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,630
你真行
I'm impressed.

886
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,930
要是我可不敢把
I don't think I'd have the nerve to gamble

887
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:31,230
自己喜欢的船拿来做赌注
with something I love as much as my ship.

888
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,830
- 是吗 - 是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

889
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,300
你开的是什么船
What do you fly?

890
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,800
VCX-100
VCX-100.

891
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,230
那可是艘好船 是吧 伙计们
That is a quality ship. Right, boys?

892
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,090
银河系最快的
It's the fastest in the galaxy,

893
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,520
银河系其他好船也不少
but there's a lot of great ships out there.

894
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,920
我觉得你的船肯定也很棒
I mean, I'm sure yours is very nice.

895
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,950
只是个代步工具呗
Gets me where I'm goin'.

896
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,570
新手好运
Beginner's luck.

897
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,470
玩的不错
Well played.

898
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,590
看看这次是什么
Let's see what we got here.

899
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,390
好牌呀
Oh, great hand!

900
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,080
抱歉各位 赢我 还差一点儿
Sorry, guys. Close, but not quite.

901
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,860
眼睛看自己的牌 伙计
Eyes on your own cards, buddy.

902
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,030
所有的眼睛
All of 'em.

903
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,960
看那儿 现在我看见你的了
There. Well, now I see yours.

904
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,400
说我吗 好 让我看看...
Oh, that's me? Okay, let's see...

905
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,930
抱歉 负二点
Sorry, minus two.

906
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,550
这游戏好玩儿
This game is fun.

907
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,560
好吧 这样如何
All right, how about this?

908
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,230
我跟你 并且加注
I'll see your bet and I'll raise you.

909
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,830
两千
2,000.

910
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,140
我跟两千
I'll see your 2,000

911
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,660
再加注
and I'll raise you

912
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,800
这些我全加上
however much this is.

913
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,260
汉
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

914
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,850
悠着点儿
Slow down.

915
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,560
你该见好就收
You might wanna quit while you're ahead.

916
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,630
那你该见输就收喽
You might wanna quit while you're behind.

917
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,410
我喜欢这家伙
I like this kid.

918
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,570
你可真逗
You're adorable.

919
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,980
我是认真的
And I'm serious.

920
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,410
我跟你
And I'm calling.

921
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,480
你用什么跟
With what?

922
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
你的围巾
Your scarf?

923
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:29,750
可不对我的口味
Not my style.

924
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,960
用我的船
My ship.

925
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,710
赌你的船
Against your ship.

926
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,490
看看你有没有这个胆
Time to find out if you got the nerve.

927
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,810
放马过来
What the hell?

928
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,090
法杖顺子
Straight Staves.

929
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,290
你耍我 你可以
You played me. You're good.

930
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,960
- 是啊 - 太会玩儿了
- Yeah. - You're very good.

931
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,320
但还差一点儿
But not good enough.

932
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,510
满点萨巴克
Full Sabacc.

933
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,850
跟你说了见好就收
I told you to quit while you were ahead.

934
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,940
我请大家喝酒
Drinks on me!

935
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,540
对 没错
Yeah, that's right.

936
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,050
首先 他绝对不可能
First of all, there's no way

937
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,630
有那张绿牌
he could've had that green sylop.

938
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:33,630
绿牌都出过了
They'd all been played.

939
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,360
而且你的神奇船长
Also, your guy, Captain Wonderful,

940
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,810
吹班萨牛不打草稿
is so full of bantha crap...

941
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,400
我的VCX在哪儿呢
Where's my VCX?

942
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,420
现在不在这儿
I don't have it right here now.

943
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,880
目前它在维修厂
It's in the shop.

944
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,660
- 我正在做一些改装 - 兰多
- I'm getting some work done. - Lando.

945
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,920
琦拉
Qi'ra.

946
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,140
你真是光彩夺目 一如既往
You look phenomenal. As always.

947
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,140
因为我要来见你啊
Well, I knew I was gonna see you.

948
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,750
别碰我
Get off!

949
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,180
你跟他们在一起干吗
What are you doing with hairy and the boy?

950
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,640
- 不关你的事儿 别问 - 他们为我工作
- There's no need, none. - They work for me.

951
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,910
嗯 好帮手难找啊
Good help is hard to find, no?

952
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,250
我们其实是合作伙伴
We're more like partners.

953
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:07,850
真的
We are.

954
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,080
失陪一下
Excuse us.

955
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,330
听我说 之前我确定过了
Listen, last I checked,

956
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,030
我跟血红黎明 已经两清了
me and Crimson Dawn, we're squared away.

957
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,790
德赖登说了
Dryden said all is forgiven

958
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,000
我为他做完费卢西亚那票 就都一笔勾销
after I did the whole Felucia thing for him.

959
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,810
这是新买卖 我们要跑科舍尔航线
Yeah. New move, we're making the Kessel Run.

960
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,790
我们需要艘船
We need a ship.

961
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,120
你怎么不早说
Why didn't you just say so?

962
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,360
我以为你不干了
I thought you were retired.

963
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,720
我为你破例了
Circumstances change.

964
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,710
你要多少
How much?

965
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,200
科舍尔航线可不太好跑
The Kessel Run.

966
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,040
我要抽百分之五十
That's no easy spin. I'm gonna need half the take.

967
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,490
你想的美
Ridiculous.

968
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,660
嘘 小孩别插嘴
Grown-ups are talking.

969
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,130
百分之二十五
25%.

970
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,660
你是托拜厄斯·贝克特
You're Tobias Beckett.

971
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,930
你杀了奥拉·辛
You killed Aurra Sing.

972
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,550
就推了一下 她肯定是自己摔死的
Pushed her. Pretty sure the fall killed her.

973
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,520
你为银河系做了件好事 对我来说更是如此
You did the galaxy a favor that day. Me, especially.

974
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,550
我欠她一大笔钱
I owed her a lot of money.

975
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:58,650
为了表达我的感激之情
And as token of my gratitude,

976
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,300
这票我愿意只抽百分之四十
I'm willing to do this for 40%.

977
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,010
二十五
25.

978
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,120
那就百分之二十五
25% works.

979
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,630
不 简直无法接受
No! Unacceptable!

980
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,760
停止剥削机器人
Stop exploiting droids!

981
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,980
你们这些堕落的生物
You sloppy degenerate bios!

982
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,660
- 她真是没记性 - 你们不觉得羞耻吗
- She never learns. - Have you no shame?

983
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,730
谁
Who?

984
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,450
我的大副
My first mate.

985
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,000
这跟你有什么关系 快滚开
You got no business being here. Get out of here!

986
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,910
你怎么能容忍这种野蛮行为
How can you condone this savagery?

987
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,710
你 你 你们不应该这样做
You, you. You should not be doing this.

988
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,350
他们在利用你们取乐
They're using you for entertainment.

989
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,210
对 你们被洗脑了
Yeah. You've been neurowashed.

990
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,440
不要盲目的服从程序
Don't just blindly follow the program.

991
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,460
行使你们的自由意志
Exercise some free will!

992
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,130
离他远一点儿
Stay away from him!

993
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,570
他从来就没有这么好过
He's never had it so good.

994
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,630
哦 真的吗 那你跟我打一架呀 你这个傻大个
Oh, really? How about you have a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

995
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:48,730
那就来啊 来呀
Bring it on! Come on!

996
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,650
L3
L3!

997
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,910
机器人平等 我们是智慧生命
Droid rights! We are sentient!

998
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,970
我要关掉你的开关
I'm gonna flip your switch.

999
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,090
找得到算你赢
Good luck finding it.

1000
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,320
L3
L3!

1001
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,100
别理那个卑鄙小人
Let go of the mean man's face.

1002
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,970
该走了
We're leaving.

1003
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,280
他们这里都不招待机器人
They don't even serve our kind here.

1004
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,230
快走
Now.

1005
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,710
这些人是谁
Who are these guys?

1006
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:11,880
送他们去科舍尔
We're taking them to Kessel.

1007
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,690
你说什么
Oh, are we?

1008
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,630
如果我不想去科舍尔呢
And what if I don't elect to go to Kessel?

1009
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,940
别闹了行不行
Please don't start.

1010
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,600
有本事清除我记忆呀
Or what, you'll have me wiped?

1011
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,930
没有我你连黑峰站都到不了
You couldn't get from here to Black Spire without me.

1012
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,450
还想跑科舍尔航线
Now you're gonna make the Kessel Run?

1013
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,560
如果她不想驾驶 我愿意当你的副驾驶
If she doesn't wanna fly, I'll be your co-pilot.

1014
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,330
- 我不介意的  - 不不不 不必了
- I don't mind. - No, no. It's okay.

1015
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,900
她肯定会去的
She's definitely going.

1016
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,140
为什么 因为你这物种天生就高我们一等是吗
Oh, why? Because you're my organic overlord?

1017
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,100
因为我是你船长 你觉得这理由怎么样
Because I'm your captain, how about that?

1018
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,640
我真想清除她的记忆
I actually would have her memory wiped,

1019
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,460
但她的航线
but she's got the best damn

1020
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,590
是银河系最全的
navigational database in the galaxy.



1022
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,730
给你上一层全新的漆怎么样
Could use a fresh coat of paint, though!

1023
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:46,220
兰多 我才不要呢 你可别把我惹火了
Landonis, you do not want to press that button with me.



1025
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,970
这里经常有船被盗
You know, a lot of ships around here get boosted.

1026
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,430
所以我平时都把船锁起来
So, I keep mine locked up.

1027
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,140
你懂的 安全起见
You know, for safety.

1028
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,990
L3 劳您大驾
L3, do you mind?

1029
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,570
别看我
Look away.

1030
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,450
你们这样我没法工作
I can't perform with you looking at me.

1031
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,580
迁就一下吧
Please indulge her.

1032
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,750
我能感觉到你们在看我
I can feel you looking at me.

1033
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,490
我们这是在干嘛
What are we doing here?

1034
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:24,720
他就是个骗子
This guy's a hustler.

1035
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,160
我觉得他根本就没有船
I don't even think he's got a ship.

1036
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,790
就算有
If he does, it's gonna be a piece of junk

1037
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,780
也绝对是个垃圾货
if it's even here.

1038
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,390
在这儿 我的心肝宝贝儿
There she is, my pride and joy.

1039
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,860
千年隼号
The Millennium Falcon.

1040
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,470
你还改装了一下
Looks like you had a little work done.

1041
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,100
的确如此 汉
Indeed I have, Han.

1042
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,600
开口处安装了一个逃生舱
Installed an escape pod in the mandible notch,

1043
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,270
还有冲流阀 小吧台
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1044
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,920
而且起落架上
And a fortified infraction

1045
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,190
还安装了强化固定器
restraint on the landing gear.

1046
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,340
看上去他们扣押了你的船 兰多
Looks to me like they impounded your ship, Lando.

1047
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,920
什么 真是岂有此理
This is unbelievable!

1048
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,470
看来
I'm definitely gonna have some words

1049
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,590
我得找人投诉了
with someone about this.

1050
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,500
你会拆除固定器吗
You must have experience with these, right?

1051
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,010
我能拆掉它们
Yeah, I could take it off.

1052
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,230
太棒了
Fantastic!

1053
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,200
那你的抽成就要扣掉百分之五
Along with five percent off your cut.

1054
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,910
给你百分之二十
You're down to 20.

1055
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,410
我不喜欢这主意
I don't like it.

1056
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,850
我不赞成
I don't agree with it.

1057
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,170
但我接受
But I accept it.

1058
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,320
你开始上道了 兰多
You're getting the hang of this, Lando.

1059
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:36,450
是啊
Yeah.

1060
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:37,650
来吧丘伊
Come on, Chewie.

1061
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,860
展示一下你的伍基之力吧
Gonna need a little bit of that Wookiee oomph.

1062
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,790
一切按计划进行 恩菲斯
Your plan is underway, Enfys.

1063
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,430
我们安装了追踪器
We've attached the homing beacon.

1064
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,410
这回他们跑不掉了
They won't elude us now.

1065
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,480
很好
Good.

1066
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,110
如果他们没死 我们就能坐享其成了
If they survive, they'll bring the prize to us.

1067
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,960
这是一艘科雷利亚YT-1300
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1068
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:17,510
你懂得不少
Oh. You know your stuff.

1069
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,780
我见过这个型号
I've been on one before.

1070
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,840
我爸爸以前
My dad worked the line

1071
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,340
在一条造船厂装配线上工作 后来丢了工作
at the CEC plant before he got laid off.

1072
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:25,700
他造过这种船
He built these.

1073
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,250
他一直想当驾驶员 但是...
He wanted to be a pilot, but...

1074
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,620
你跟你爸关系好吗
You, uh, close with your old man?

1075
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,750
不算好
Not really.

1076
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,920
是吗 我也是
Yeah, me neither.

1077
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,060
不过 我的妈妈
My mom, on the other hand,

1078
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,270
是我见过最美的女人
most amazing woman I've ever known.

1079
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,660
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1080
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,420
把你骄傲的屁股从我的座位上移开
Get your presumptuous ass out of my seat!

1081
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:56,070
我的骶骨枕骨电路卡住了
My sacral-occipital circuit is sticking.

1082
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,130
等会儿你得再来一次
You're gonna have to do that thing again later.

1083
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,050
好
Yeah.

1084
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,270
好了 科舍尔航线已设定
All right, course to Kessel is set.

1085
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,950
现在导入方位数据
Plugging coordinates in now.

1086
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,510
手放在操纵杆上就行
Just keep your pinky on the yoke

1087
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:06,750
别弄坏其他设备
and try not to mess anything up.

1088
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:07,750
听你的 女士
Whatever you say, my lady.

1089
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,390
提醒我什么时候跳跃
Just let me know when you're ready to jump.

1090
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,120
准备
Ready in...

1091
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,030
好了
Ready.

1092
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:18,290
不就是一个简单的超空间跳跃吗
It's just a simple jump to hyperspace, and we're there.

1093
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,670
这有什么难的
What's so tricky about that?

1094
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,080
很麻烦 科舍尔没有直达航线
Plenty. Can't plot a direct course to Kessel.

1095
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,660
你必须穿过西克拉塔星团
You have to thread through the Si'Klaata Cluster

1096
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,180
然后再穿越大漩涡
and then pass through The Maelstrom.

1097
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,130
调完情没 我好了
You done flirting? I'm still ready.

1098
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,180
系上安全带 宝贝儿
You might wanna buckle up, baby.

1099
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,030
想好
Think.

1100
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,800
你真走这步嘛
Do you wanna make that move?

1101
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:57,240
你真走这步嘛
- Do you wanna make that move?

1102
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,160
你真走了这步
You made that move, okay.

1103
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,010
好的 我想我不得不干掉这个小家伙
I guess I have to destroy that little guy.

1104
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,190
不知为何 每次赢我都觉得很开心
Somehow I never get bored with winning.

1105
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,240
你没法把棋子扫下去 这是全息象棋
No, you can't wipe 'em off. They're holograms.

1106
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,320
丘伊 放松
Hey, hey, hey! Chewie, relax!

1107
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,470
冷静下来 听着
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1108
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,850
你需要提前想好对策
Look. All you gotta do is think a few moves ahead,

1109
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,190
预测对手的行动
anticipate your opponent.

1110
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,620
这里面的学问大着呢
There's a lesson to be learned here.

1111
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,930
见到琦拉了吗
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

1112
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,610
人心是很好猜的
People are predictable.

1113
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,520
我得试穿一下嘛
Yeah, I had to try one on.

1114
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,090
这有好多披风
That's a lot of capes.

1115
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,170
也许多过头了
Maybe too many capes.

1116
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,200
你有什么计划
So what's the plan?

1117
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:00,800
我觉得我们可以先聊一会
Well, I thought we'd talk a little first

1118
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,660
然后...你懂的
and then you know...

1119
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,670
我是说科舍尔的计划
- For Kessel. - Oh.

1120
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,270
好极了
- Mmm-hmm. - Good.

1121
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,910
是吗 有多好
Yeah? How good?

1122
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,080
万无一失
Foolproof.

1123
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,880
最好是这样
Well, it better be.

1124
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:11,940
- 我 呃... - 我...
- I... - I...

1125
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,210
你先说
- You go first. - No.

1126
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,880
你刚才想说什么
What were you gonna say?

1127
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,870
我有很多的话 想跟你说
I wanna tell you so much.

1128
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,920
而且我想知道
And I wanna know everything

1129
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,670
你在科雷利亚都经历了些什么
that's happened to you since Corellia.

1130
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,670
我不确定我们有没有那么多时间
I'm not sure we have that kinda time.

1131
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,930
会有的
We could.

1132
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:29,350
做完这笔买卖后
We could have all the time we want after the job.

1133
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:30,500
我们有的是时间
You and I.

1134
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,170
怎么了
What?

1135
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,480
我想...
I want to.

1136
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,540
你想什么
You want to?

1137
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,690
我想把一切都告诉你
To tell you everything that's happened.

1138
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,610
我知道那样的话
But I know if I do, you won't look at me the same.

1139
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,640
你就不会再用这样的眼神看着我了
The way that you're looking at me right now.

1140
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,100
什么也改变不了
Nothing is gonna change the way

1141
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,950
我看你的眼神
I'm looking at you right now.

1142
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,440
你不知道 你不知道我做过...
You don't know that. You don't know what I've done.

1143
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,810
我是不是扫你们的兴了
Am I interrupting something?

1144
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,440
有一点
Kinda.

1145
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:09,980
那就好
Good.

1146
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,340
因为我们有很多活要干
'Cause we got a lot of work to do.

1147
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,930
你这样非常不明智
You're making a big mistake.

1148
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,050
- 怎么了 - 别的事我不管
- Oh, really? - Which is yours to make

1149
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,280
可你开始影响到我的生意 我们就得说说了
except when you start to interfere with my livelihood.

1150
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,340
这不会影响到你的生意
This isn't gonna interfere with your livelihood.

1151
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,350
那就有问题了
Then we have a problem.

1152
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,840
你没意识到 因为你不想
You don't see it, because you don't want to.

1153
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,480
也许我比你更了解现在的情况
Maybe I know her a little better than you do.

1154
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,350
也许你对她还不够了解
Maybe you don't know her well enough.

1155
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:27,920
懂了没
All right?

1156
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,490
听着
Look.

1157
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,660
我觉得你不错 年轻人
I like you, kid.

1158
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:34,240
我们相处的很不错 我 你和丘伊
We got a good thing going here. Me, you, Chewie.

1159
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,200
- 对呀 - 对啊
- Yeah. - Right?

1160
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,450
我们是一个可靠的团队
The makings of a solid crew.

1161
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,630
但是不包括琦拉
But it does not work with Qi'ra.

1162
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:42,080
包括瓦尔吗 你信任她
It worked with Val. You trusted her.

1163
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,790
你知道我是怎么活到现在的吗
You wanna know how I've survived as long as I have?

1164
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,050
我谁也不相信
I trust no one.

1165
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,940
做好被所有人背叛的准备
Assume everyone will betray you

1166
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,820
你就永远不会措手不及
and you will never be disappointed.

1167
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:58,150
真是孤独的生活方式
Sounds like a lonely way to live.

1168
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,680
只有这样才能活下去
It's the only way.

1169
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,360
准备脱离超时空
Dropping out of lightspeed now.

1170
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,440
准备...
Ready to...

1171
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,850
阿卡德大旋涡
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1172
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,450
我去检查下阻尼器
I'm gonna go check on the dampers.

1173
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:22,420
你要来点什么吗
You need anything?

1174
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,830
平等权利
Equal rights?

1175
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,190
什么声音
What's that sound?

1176
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:58,450
矿山 有行星那么大 正在互相撞击
Carbonbergs, size of planets, crashing into each other.

1177
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,980
船飞进去就别想出来了
Ships fly in there, they never come out.

1178
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,030
里面是电离气体和水蒸气
It's ionized gas, water vapor,

1179
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:04,810
黑洞团周围
possibly vacuum-breathing life forms

1180
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,250
可能还有太空生物
swirling around The Maw.

1181
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,230
这条通道是唯一的出入口
Only way in or out is this channel.

1182
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,170
你怎么处理你的小麻烦
So what are you gonna do about your little problem?

1183
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,710
麻烦 我 呃...
Problem?

1184
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,680
你手腕上的烙印
Well, that brand on your wrist

1185
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,770
说明了你的身份
tells me that you're committed.

1186
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:20,710
而那个小伙子的心率告诉我
And that young male's heart fluctuations

1187
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,120
他已经爱上你了
tell me he's in love with you.

1188
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,780
汉才没有爱上我呢
Han is not in love with me!

1189
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,990
行了 就咱俩
Oh, please. It's just us.

1190
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,600
你不必装了 我跟你的情况一样
You don't have to pretend. I'm in the same situation.

1191
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,480
什么
You are?

1192
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,490
我想你已经发现
I'm sure you've noticed

1193
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,960
兰多对我有感觉
that Lando has feelings for me.

1194
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,500
这让我们工作的时候很不便
Which makes working together difficult

1195
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,950
因为我对他没感觉
because I do not feel the same way about him.

1196
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,350
没错
Right.

1197
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,110
对
Yes, yeah.

1198
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,650
我看出来了
Yeah, I see that.

1199
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,480
有时候我想...也许
Sometimes, I think... Maybe.

1200
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,540
算了
But, no.

1201
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,050
我们俩不兼容
We're just not compatible.

1202
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,710
你们俩可以吗
How would that work?

1203
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,540
可以的
It works.

1204
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,720
这次的任务需要完美配合
This is a precision job.

1205
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,340
保温仓库 在最下面的一层
Thermal vault will be on the lowest level.

1206
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,750
那里温度高
Down where it's warm.

1207
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,270
我们成功的唯一办法就是
The only way we're gonna pull this off

1208
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,480
每个人都完成他分内的任务
is if everybody plays their part.

1209
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,330
严格按计划来
Stick to the plan.

1210
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,470
绝不允许擅作主张
Do not improvise.

1211
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,410
采矿基地的条件真糟糕
Mining colonies are the worst.

1212
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:31,030
是啊 最糟糕的地方
Yeah, well, "the worst"

1213
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,670
才有钱赚
is where the money is.

1214
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,050
好了 各位 开始干活儿吧
All right, people. Time to shine.

1215
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,410
不会太久的
It won't be for long.

1216
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:17,340
你们两个都闭嘴
Shut up, the both of you.

1217
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,100
我是奥克萨娜·弗洛伦
I am Oksana Floren,

1218
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,560
贸易路线规划
Deputy Assistant Administrator to the Vice-Admiral

1219
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,410
及货币化联盟
of the Federation of Trade Route Allocation

1220
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,920
中将的副助理行政官
and Monetization.

1221
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,420
我很荣幸地代表高级中将
Here with an offer from his eminence,

1222
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,470
前来提议一笔交易
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1223
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,110
你们的香料 换我们的奴隶
Your spice for our hard-working slaves.

1224
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,670
我带了样品
I brought you a sample.

1225
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:38,430
图尔 把货带过来
Tuul, bring forth the merchandise.

1226
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,980
托尔赛特总管
Director Tolsite said our slaves

1227
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,180
要求我们的奴隶
should follow those guys

1228
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:12,040
跟着他们去进行修剪
to get clipped and tagged.

1229
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,220
修剪什么
What are they clipping?

1230
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,430
他让我们跟着他
He wants us to follow him.

1231
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,230
搞什么
Really?

1232
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:25,530
叫你刚才不规矩
That's for that stunt you pulled earlier,

1233
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,920
下贱的东西
you degenerate scum.

1234
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:48,120
他说这片区域所有设备
He says all systems in this sector

1235
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,250
都由这里的系统操控
of the facility operate out of this room.

1236
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,950
这样他们就能用少量人手
It's how they're able to maintain control

1237
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,910
控制大量奴隶
over so many with so few.

1238
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:00,050
总管说他们的处理程序
The director says their reconditioning process

1239
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,450
极为痛苦 但是很有效果
is excruciating but effective.

1240
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,960
他说你的卫兵可以在门外等
He said your security attache can wait there.

1241
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,320
我们谈生意时不需要他
"Surely, we don't need him to negotiate."

1242
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,530
在外面等着 图尔
Wait there, Tuul.

1243
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:28,330
不要打扰到别人
Try not to bother anyone.

1244
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,350
怎么回事

1245
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,290
真棒
Nice!

1246
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,760
那套制服我正好能穿
That was the uniform

1247
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,340
不过没关系
that would've fit me perfectly, but it's fine.

1248
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,590
能帮我拿一下吗
Would you mind holding this for me?

1249
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,220
哇 我从没有见过有谁能...
I have never see anyone do...

1250
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,220
那是什么武功
What was that?

1251
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:30,420
铁手功
Teras Kasi.

1252
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,610
德赖登教我的
Dryden taught me.

1253
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,250
啊
Ah.

1254
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,520
谈的不错啊
Well negotiated.

1255
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,840
对不起 我需要用这台终端
Excuse me. I need to use this terminal.

1256
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:53,930
你好
Hello?

1257
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,700
能听见吗
Can you hear me? Ugh.

1258
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,770
抑制螺栓
Restraining bolts...

1259
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,060
太野蛮了
Barbaric.

1260
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,940
恭喜 你自由了 走吧
Congratulations! You're liberated. Scoot.

1261
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,970
我不知道
I don't know.

1262
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,410
去解放你的兄弟姐妹吧
Free your brothers and sisters or something.

1263
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,010
先让一让
Just give me some space.

1264
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,320
我进来了
I'm in!

1265
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,390
汉 听得到吗
Han, can you hear me?

1266
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:19,050
谁能告诉我该怎么走
I kinda need to know which way to go here.

1267
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,270
L3
L3?

1268
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,000
保温仓库在地下二层
The thermal vault is down two levels,

1269
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,010
往左 再往右 到第三个路口左拐
then left, then right, then it's the third left.

1270
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:27,050
好的 这里这里路口太多 我们能走通的
Right. That's a lot of directions, but we're on it.

1271
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,190
他们在第四分区
They're in subsector four,

1272
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:37,640
正在前往X-3-7-1-K闸门
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1273
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,870
正在远程控制
Overriding!

1274
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,130
自由
Freedom.

1275
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,860
你们在上面搞什么名堂呢
What the hell are you guys doing up there?

1276
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:12,930
我制造了一些混乱
I created a distraction!

1277
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:19,050
过来 走这边
Come on! This way!

1278
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,420
等等 你在干什么
Wait! What are you doing?

1279
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,280
快点儿 我们得去拿核芯素
Come on, we gotta get the coaxium.

1280
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,940
记住贝克特的话 严格按计划来
Hey! Remember what Beckett said, stick to the plan.

1281
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:32,880
丘伊 快点 我们走
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1282
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,260
好吧
Fine!

1283
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,830
丘伊
Chewie!

1284
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,990
你可能需要这个
Here, you might need this.

1285
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,100
希望以后还能再见到你
Hope I see you around sometime.

1286
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,120
汉 你在哪儿
Han, where are you?

1287
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,960
我在去仓库的路上
I'm on my way to the vault.

1288
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,230
丘伊走了
I lost Chewie.

1289
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,310
他死了么
He's dead?

1290
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,160
不 他有自己的事要去做
No, he had something he had to do.

1291
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,420
他还回来吗
Is he coming back?

1292
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,470
我不知道
I don't know.

1293
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,760
好吧 他们来找我们了
Okay, they're on to us now.

1294
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:31,660
我在仓库了
I'm at the vault.

1295
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,970
就你话多
That's what I said!

1296
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,320
- 干得不错 - 是的
- Huh, that was impressive. - Yeah.

1297
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:47,630
安全了
We're clear.

1298
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,330
现在怎么办
Now what?

1299
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,280
听着 汉 每个储藏器上
Han, each canister should be equipped

1300
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,540
应该都装有温度指示器
with a thermal display.

1301
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,720
对 我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1302
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,850
如果内部温度低于35标准温度
If the internal temperature reaches below 35 standard,

1303
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:09,980
那么核芯素就会不稳定并且爆炸
then the coaxium will destabilize and explode.

1304
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,470
好 我知道了 这玩意很危险
Yup, I get it, guys. It's dangerous.

1305
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,910
好的 搞定了
Okay, got it.

1306
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,720
很好 只剩十一个了
Great. Only eleven more.

1307
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,170
十一个
Eleven?

1308
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,630
卡瑞辛编年史 第五章
The Calrissian Chronicles, chapter five.

1309
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,340
继续
continued.

1310
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,400
其实我并不觉得沙鲁人有多么伟大
Personally, I wasn't all that impressed with the Sharu.

1311
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,790
既不幽默也没格调
No sense of humor or style.

1312
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,940
尽管如此 我和L3
Nonetheless, there L3 and I were

1313
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,810
来到他们的圣殿深处
deep in their sacred temple.

1314
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:48,660
那时我们看到了
And that's when we saw it...

1315
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:52,740
老是被打断
Always something.

1316
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,980
你们绝不会相信我看到了什么
You guys are not gonna believe what I'm seeing up here.

1317
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,120
一场全面暴乱吗
Is it a mass breakout?

1318
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:00,570
L3  你干了什么
L3, what did you do?

1319
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,670
我发现了我的使命 兰多
I found my true purpose, Lando.

1320
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:03,980
我发动了这次起义
That's what I've done.

1321
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,930
我真高兴能接下这个活
I'm so glad we took this job!

1322
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,400
这个笨蛋机器人
That droid!

1323
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,560
L3  跟上
L3, come on!

1324
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,440
跟我来同胞们
Follow me, compatriots!

1325
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,590
有几个守卫发现我了
Another couple guards just spotted me.

1326
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,550
我腾不出手对付他们
I don't have a free hand to take 'em out.

1327
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:28,270
- 怎么办 - 自己看着办
- What do I do? - Improvise.

1328
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,230
你不是不让擅作主张吗
You said never improvise!

1329
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,270
嗨
Hi!

1330
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,430
注意那边那个家伙
Don't forget that guy!

1331
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,620
见到你真好 兄弟
Good to see you, buddy!

1332
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:01,890
跟紧我 萨格瓦
Stay with me, Sagwa! Keep up!

1333
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,010
嗨 我是丘伊的朋友 汉
Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han.

1334
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:10,710
好吧
Okay.

1335
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,600
他们偷走了核芯素

1336
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,360
干掉那艘船

1337
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,170
汉
Han!

1338
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,900
嗨
Hey!

1339
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:55,260
跟我来
Follow me.

1340
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,060
反抗吧
Rebellion!

1341
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,700
他们要破坏起落架
They're going for the landing gear!

1342
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,040
我们得赶紧离开这
We've gotta get out of here!

1343
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,390
我们必须远离那些激光炮
We need to keep 'em away from those cannons!

1344
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,700
接我一招
Catch that!

1345
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,040
核芯素装上船了 快走
Coaxium's stowed! Let's go!

1346
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,850
L3去哪了
Where's L3?

1347
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,970
勇敢对压迫说不
No more subjugation!

1348
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,400
L3
L3!

1349
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:43,420
别去 兰多 快回来
No, Lando! Get back here!

1350
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,370
兰多
Lando!

1351
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,100
系统故障
System failure.

1352
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,340
需要重建传感调节器
Have to reroute the sensory modulators.

1353
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,030
没关系的 保存能量
It's all right. Save your energy.

1354
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,790
我马上带你离开这 好吗
I'm gonna get you outta here. All right?

1355
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:57,430
系统故障 故障  故障...
System failure...

1356
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,130
重建回路
Rerouting...

1357
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,810
该死的
Damn it!

1358
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:07,650
汉
Han!

1359
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,670
萨格瓦
Sagwa.

1360
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,170
这边...
This way!

1361
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,330
快点 快点
Come, come!

1362
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,230
丘伊 该死
Chewie! Damn it!

1363
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,410
没有回应
It's not responding.

1364
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,780
你们愣在这干嘛 快走
What are you standing around for? Come on!

1365
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,110
没关系 你会好起来的
It's okay, you'll be fine.

1366
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,730
没有回应 没有回应
It's not responding... Not responding...

1367
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,550
汉 带我们离开这儿
Han, get us out of here.

1368
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,410
没有回应
It's not responding.

1369
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:10,770
汉 快点儿
Han! Now!

1370
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,460
我这就去
On it.

1371
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:41,870
- 兰多 - 我在这儿
- Lando... - I'm here.

1372
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,150
- 没事儿的 L3 - 兰多
- It's all right, L3. - Lando...

1373
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,300
- 我陪着你 - 这...
- I've got you. - This is not...

1374
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,860
- 没事儿的 L3 - 兰多
- It's okay, L3. - Lando.

1375
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,300
我能修好你 我能修好你
It's all right. I can fix you. I can fix you.

1376
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,700
兰多
Lando.

1377
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,750
我这是怎么了
What's happening to me?

1378
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,690
L3
L3?

1379
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:58,460
L3
L3!

1380
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,830
对不起宝贝
I'm sorry, girl.

1381
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,440
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1382
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,620
我需要个副驾驶
I could use a co-pilot.

1383
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,440
我很难过
Sorry.

1384
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,240
我们带的这些货
With the cargo we're carrying,

1385
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,460
如果不动作快点
if we don't make up some lost time

1386
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,830
就有大麻烦了
we're gonna be in real trouble.

1387
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:59,480
那个算是大麻烦吗
How about that? Is that real trouble?

1388
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,430
那是一道帝国封锁线
That is an Imperial blockade.

1389
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,110
他们来这儿干嘛
What's it doing here?

1390
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,100
可能听说了你的小暴乱
Probably heard about your little rebellion.

1391
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,650
不 过不去的
Nope. Not gonna make it.

1392
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:16,880
我们必须扔掉货物
We're gonna have to drop the shipment.

1393
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,400
我们如果交不了货 德赖登会杀了我们
If we don't deliver, Dryden will kill us.

1394
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,090
没事儿 相信我 我了解帝国海军
All right, trust me, I know these guys.

1395
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,360
我以前是他们的一员
I used to be one of 'em.

1396
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,290
他们绝不会用双离子引擎战斗机
There's no way they're gonna waste a TIE fighter

1397
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,220
去追逐一艘小破船的
chasing down a little rinky-dink freighter.

1398
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:31,800
你说什么来着
You were saying?

1399
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,340
遇见这种情况
Usually, in situations like this

1400
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,470
我一般会掉头往反方向跑
I like to turn around in the opposite direction.

1401
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:46,130
我去操作底部航炮
I'm on the ventral gun.

1402
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,700
有个明显的问题
It's an easy equation.

1403
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:54,740
我们根本就来不及
We simply don't have enough time to get to Savareen

1404
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,960
在储藏罐爆炸前抵达萨瓦林
before the canisters explode!

1405
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,340
找条更快的航线就行
Just have to find a faster route.

1406
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,440
没有 科舍尔航线
There isn't one! You can't make

1407
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,220
至少要二十秒差距
the Kessel Run in less than 20 parsecs.

1408
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,710
- 看我操作就行了 - 怎么做
- Watch me. - How?

1409
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,650
抄近路 从那儿走
Take a shortcut, through there.

1410
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,640
你想进入大漩涡
- Into The Maelstrom? - Mmm-hmm.

1411
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,700
这种害死大家的方式很刺激啊
Spectacular way of killing us all, I'll give you that.

1412
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,590
- 有L3帮我 - 她不在了
- Can't do it without L3. - She's gone!

1413
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:11,980
你说过她有整个银河系中
You said yourself she's got the best

1414
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:13,570
最全的导航系统
navigational database in the galaxy.

1415
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:14,750
如果我们取出它的神经核心
If we remove her neural core,

1416
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,120
就能把电子脑
it's possible we can download her brain

1417
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,270
下载到千年隼的导航中 对吧
into the Falcon's navicomputer, right?

1418
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:19,350
可行吗
Could we?

1419
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,910
理论上行
Theoretically.

1420
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,580
试试就知道了
Only one way to find out.

1421
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,420
我有一种非常好的预感
I got a really good feeling about this.

1422
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,300
哦 是我不好
Oops, that's on me.

1423
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:51,730
好了
Okay.

1424
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:55,680
贝克特 他们还在追吗
Beckett, you see them? They still on us?

1425
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,250
贝克特 能听到吗
Beckett, did you hear me?

1426
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,520
他们还在追吗
Are they on us?

1427
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,600
就像卡拉兽身上的拉什诺
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1428
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,980
我听不懂这话是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

1429
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,240
就像金格森的毛皮
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1430
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,210
到底追还是没追
What? Are they or aren't they?

1431
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:12,030
是的 他们还在追我们
Yes, they're still on us!

1432
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:23,540
这就是为什么 我从不把船借给别人
This is why you never let anyone fly your ship.

1433
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:24,620
来啊
Come on!

1434
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:31,570
有一架飞过去了就在我们头顶上
Yeah, one just got past me. He's right on top of us!

1435
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,570
干得漂亮 汉
Good going, Han!

1436
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,860
我们得把辅助动力
We need to divert auxiliary power

1437
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,110
转到尾部偏导护盾上
to the rear deflector shield.

1438
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,010
你说的没错
We definitely do!

1439
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,440
你什么时候学会开飞船的
Since when do you know how to fly?

1440
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:06,570
你一百九十岁了
190 years old?

1441
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,670
保养得真好
You look great!

1442
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,150
丘伊 坐这儿
Chewie, get in.

1443
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,280
我去帮兰多
I'll help Lando.

1444
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:30,560
我的披风
Whoa! That's my cape!

1445
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,330
那可是私人定制的
Ah! That's a custom piece!

1446
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:41,780
怎么了 贝克特 你还在吗
What? Beckett, you with us?

1447
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,140
航炮已经报废了
We just lost the cannon!

1448
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,100
我的拇指都烫伤了
And I really hurt my thumbs.

1449
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,630
后面还有一架
There's still one on us.

1450
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,070
放下起落架
Drop the landing gear.

1451
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,070
听我的指令 燃料阀门全开
When I tell you, flood the intake

1452
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,610
向侧面滑动
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1453
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,950
这招我跟一个叫针头的兄弟学的
A little something I picked up from my pal, Needles,

1454
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,900
他是科雷利亚最棒的街头赛车手
best street racer in all of Corellia.

1455
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:09,300
后来他玩脱了
Till he crashed

1456
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,760
车毁人亡
and died, doing this.

1457
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:31,220
全开 看你的了
Flood it, it's all yours!

1458
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:45,320
干得漂亮
Nice move!

1459
01:29:48,330 --> 01:29:50,030
把它的内部处理器拉出来
Pull out her internal processor.

1460
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:53,940
对不起
Sorry.

1461
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,650
拿出来了
We've got L3.

1462
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:05,170
取出模组校准器
Remove the mod calibrator.

1463
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:06,240
注意接通线
Make sure the T-Line's connected.

1464
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:07,920
我会接通的 别担心
I'm gonna tuck it in. Don't worry.

1465
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,960
好了吗
You close?

1466
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,420
核芯素已经开始不稳定了
That coaxium's getting real ripe.

1467
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:13,790
好了
Okay.

1468
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:17,390
它正在建立连接
She's interfacing.

1469
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,400
L3与飞船融为一体了
She's part of the ship now.

1470
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,450
我们究竟在哪儿
Where the hell are we?

1471
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,870
根本不在地图上
We're way off the edge of the map.

1472
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:39,580
等等
Wait.

1473
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,280
L3正在绘制大漩涡的模型
L3's constructing a model of The Maelstrom.

1474
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:47,170
她说我们正在接近无底洞
She says we're approaching The Maw.

1475
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,340
我觉得
That doesn't sound like something

1476
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:49,850
不该接近那东西
we wanna be approaching.

1477
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:11,860
坐稳
Hang on!

1478
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,310
这就是无底洞 不 那不是无底洞
This is The Maw?

1479
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:20,350
我不知道那是什么
No, that's not The Maw. I don't know what this is.

1480
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,590
那是个活的东西
That's a living thing.

1481
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:37,610
在那里
There!

1482
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,780
那是无底洞
That's The Maw.

1483
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:43,170
那是个引力井
It's a gravity well.

1484
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:44,460
我有个主意
I got an idea.

1485
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:47,390
不要飞过去 汉
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1486
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:56,320
看它会不会追这个
See if it goes for this.

1487
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:58,160
你要干什么 那是逃生舱
No, what are you doing? That's the escape pod!

1488
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:00,800
我知道
I know.

1489
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,110
那你为什么这么做
Then why'd you do it?

1490
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,890
这就是为什么 宝贝儿
That's why, baby.

1491
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,980
发现一个出口
She found a way out.

1492
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:27,340
九十度 往左一点儿
90 degrees, to the left... ish.

1493
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,340
往左
Left-ish.

1494
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:29,700
不行
I can't.

1495
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,620
开足马力也只能停留在外围
It's taking everything we got to stay out of The Maw.

1496
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:33,280
我们被吸住了
It's pulling us in. We're stuck.

1497
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,700
我们的核芯素足够驱动几十艘歼星舰
We have enough raw coaxium to power a dozen destroyers.

1498
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,690
把它加入燃料线路 只会把船炸飞
Inject it into the fuel line, it'll blow up the ship.

1499
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,130
不加入燃料
Not the fuel line.

1500
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:45,370
如果往融核反应堆里滴一滴
But if we put one drop into the fusion reactor,

1501
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:45,930
也许可以
it might just...

1502
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:47,400
提供我们需要的动力
Give us the kick we need.

1503
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,200
我这就去
All right, I'm on it!

1504
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:55,390
我知道 我们正被拽着兜圈子
I know, we're getting dragged in a circle.

1505
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:11,690
一旦我们对准就直线冲刺
Once we get lined up, it's gonna be a straight shot.

1506
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:12,810
当核芯素点燃后
As soon as that coaxium ignites,

1507
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:13,640
我们就能摆脱引力井
we're gonna tear out of here

1508
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,220
脱离大漩涡的瞬间
and the second we're clear of The Maelstrom,

1509
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,610
就跳入超空间
we jump to lightspeed.

1510
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,740
贝克特
Beckett!

1511
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,150
别打扰我
Can't talk!

1512
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,130
我看见了
I see it.

1513
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:53,610
贝克特 快点儿
Beckett, hurry up!

1514
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:55,670
我们只有这一次机会
We only get one shot at this thing!

1515
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:57,940
闭嘴 让我安心干活
Shut up and let me do this!

1516
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,790
贝克特 我要倒计时了
Beckett, I'm gonna count you down!

1517
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,130
三
Three!

1518
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,090
二
Two!

1519
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,310
点火
Now!

1520
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:21,410
现在吗
Now?

1521
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,260
现在
Now!

1522
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:40,260
哦 见鬼
Oh, shoot...

1523
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:54,460
丘伊 等我指示 你就全力加速
Chewie, when I tell you, kick out the thrusters

1524
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:56,200
- 跳入超空间 - 等等 你们这是
- and jump to lightspeed. - Wait, what are we...

1525
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,400
记得那次穿越桑希
Remember that alley we slipped through

1526
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,560
造船厂的小巷吗
in the Santhe Shipyards?

1527
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,610
对 我记得 但那次失败了
Yeah, I remember! I remember it didn't work.

1528
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:01,910
这次会成功的
This time it's gonna.

1529
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:13,130
加速
Punch it!

1530
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,240
萨瓦林 这里是千年隼号
Savareen, this is Millennium Falcon.

1531
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,140
我们运载着核芯素 需要立即进行卸货
We have coaxium that needs to be off-loaded immediately.

1532
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,580
十万火急 十万火急
Like immediately, immediately!

1533
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:33,820
我们已经到了
We're here now...

1534
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,180
我能看见你们
...see you. I...

1535
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,370
用十二秒差距跑完了科舍尔航线
Just did the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.

1536
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:14,550
四舍五入 兄弟
Not if you round down, buddy.

1537
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:15,910
对
Yeah.

1538
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:24,240
真是一艘好船
She is a hell of a ship.

1539
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,300
我恨你
I hate you.

1540
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:35,830
我知道
I know.

1541
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,210
我会在我的船上
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1542
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,170
在我的房间里
in my quarters,

1543
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:45,240
等着你把我的那份给我送来
waiting for you to bring me my share.

1544
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:49,890
然后我再也不想见到你
And then I don't ever wanna see you again.

1545
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,900
再也不见么
Never?

1546
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:11,590
你老板呢
Where's your boss?

1547
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:14,100
哦 他马上就过来
Oh. Don't worry. He'll be here.

1548
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,180
然后呢
Then what?

1549
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,580
好吧 你交了货
Well, you delivered,

1550
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,870
然后就能拿到钱
so you will get paid.

1551
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:24,540
就可以买船了
You can buy that ship.

1552
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,770
你知道我问的不是这个
You know that's not what I'm asking.

1553
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,070
不可能的
It can't happen.

1554
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,720
你爱上德赖登了
Because you're with Dryden?

1555
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,830
我没有爱上他 但我欠他的
I'm not with him, but I owe him.

1556
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,600
是他帮我脱离了困境
He helped me out of a bad situation.

1557
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:47,840
你需要多久还清这笔债
And how long do you have to pay off that debt?

1558
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,920
每个人都要为别人做事 汉
Everyone serves somebody, Han.

1559
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,100
即便是德赖登也是听命于别人
Even Dryden Vos.

1560
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:59,920
没人想成为血红黎明的敌人
Look, you don't want to make an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1561
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,370
如果我跟你走了
which is exactly what you and I would both be doing

1562
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,860
那我俩肯定都变成他的敌人
if I left here with you.

1563
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:05,710
我一点都不怕血红黎明
I'm not afraid of Crimson Dawn.

1564
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:07,840
我能照顾好我自己
I can take care of myself.

1565
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,450
我早已经不是科雷利亚
You know, I'm not the kid you knew

1566
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:11,020
星球上的那个小孩了 琦拉
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

1567
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:12,150
不是吗 不是
- No? - No.

1568
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,220
那你是谁
Then who are you?

1569
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:15,550
亡命之徒
I'm an outlaw.

1570
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,740
怎么 我没开玩笑
What? I'm not kidding.

1571
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:20,040
好吧
Okay.

1572
01:38:20,050 --> 01:38:22,940
亡命之徒 你能骗得了你自己
Okay, outlaw, you can tell yourself that,

1573
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:25,290
但这个银河系里
but I might be the only person in the whole galaxy

1574
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:26,840
也许只有我知道你是谁
who knows what you really are.

1575
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,740
是吗
Yeah.

1576
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,080
那我是谁
What's that?

1577
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,980
你是一个好人
You are the good guy.

1578
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:38,930
我并不是一个好人
I am not the good guy.

1579
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:42,600
我是个…我肯定不是好人
I am definitely not a good guy.

1580
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,270
我是个糟糕的家伙
I'm a terrible person.

1581
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,780
他们说核芯素提炼完后
They say when the coaxium's refined,

1582
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,330
就可以去上面拿了
we collect it up there.

1583
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:15,960
听说你们的白兰地不错
So, I hear you make good brandy.

1584
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,810
贝克特
Beckett.

1585
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,610
别
Don't.

1586
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:50,540
你肯定知道我们会再见面的
You must've known you'd see me again.

1587
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:52,070
一直等着呢
I was counting on it.

1588
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,390
只是没想到这么快就再见面了
Just didn't plan on it being so soon.

1589
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,370
当然你现在有麻烦了
Of course now, you've got a problem.

1590
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:59,320
是大麻烦
Big problem.

1591
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:05,550
你看到下面那艘货船了吧
You happen to notice that freighter down there?

1592
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:07,750
你知道上面有什么吗
You know what's on it?

1593
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,650
三十个雇佣兵
About 30 hired guns.

1594
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:11,860
我只需要给他们一个信号
All I gotta do is give 'em the signal,

1595
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,100
你们就会被包围
you're surrounded.

1596
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:31,150
对不起 你继续说
Sorry. You do your thing.

1597
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,830
等核芯素提炼完成
By the time that coaxium gets refined,

1598
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,630
血红黎明的人就会过来的
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1599
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,630
如果你杀了我们
so you go ahead and kill us.

1600
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,530
他们就会杀了你
They're gonna kill you.

1601
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:41,960
我们各让一步
Perhaps there's a compromise,

1602
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,750
就不用杀来杀去了
one that doesn't involve so much killing.

1603
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:46,120
他们是土匪
They're marauders.

1604
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,250
根本不在乎其他人死活
They don't care about anybody.

1605
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,060
他们只知道杀戮
All they know how to do is kill.

1606
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:16,000
我得喝一杯
I need a drink.

1607
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:18,030
带他们进来
Bring them inside.

1608
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:32,020
我妈妈曾经跟我讲
My mother once told me

1609
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:33,380
有一群雇佣兵
about a band of mercenaries

1610
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:35,710
来到一个和平星球
that came to a peaceful planet.

1611
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:39,140
他们看上了那里的资源
They had a resource there these men coveted,

1612
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:41,270
便强行抢夺
so they took it.

1613
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,670
他们每次回来都变本加厉
They kept coming back, taking more.

1614
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,300
最终人们反抗了
Until finally, the people resisted.

1615
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:49,340
当他们再一次回来抢夺时
When they returned demanding their tribute,

1616
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:53,010
人们奋起反击而且异口同声地喊道 不行
the people shouted back in one voice, "No more!"

1617
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,560
雇佣兵被激怒了
The mercenaries didn't like the sound of that,

1618
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:56,590
他们切掉人们的舌头
so they cut off the tongue

1619
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:00,330
不分男女老少
of every last man, woman, and child.

1620
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,500
知道那群禽兽是谁吗
Do you know what that pack of animals became?

1621
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:05,190
告诉他们
Tell them.

1622
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:18,640
血红黎明和其余五大集团
Crimson Dawn and the rest of the five Syndicates

1623
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,180
在银河系犯下了
have committed unspeakable crimes

1624
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,380
令人发指的罪行
across the galaxy.

1625
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,580
一面之词
Says you.

1626
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:25,680
不
No.

1627
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,670
他们能证明
Says them.

1628
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:29,730
我们每个人的家园
Each of our worlds has been brutalized

1629
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:31,520
都遭到他们蹂躏
by the Syndicates.

1630
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,140
血红黎明会通过
Crimson Dawn will use their profits

1631
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,360
你们偷来的这批核芯素获利
from the coaxium you stole

1632
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,810
暴力统治更多星系
to tyrannize system after system

1633
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:38,980
与帝国狼狈为奸
in league with the Empire.

1634
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:41,010
那你会用它做什么
And what would you use it for?

1635
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:43,580
像我妈妈一样 如果她还活着
The same thing my mother would have used it for

1636
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:46,120
戴着这副面具
if she had survived and still wore the mask.

1637
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:48,790
我会抗争到底
To fight back.

1638
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,350
我们不是土匪
We're not marauders.

1639
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,310
我们是同盟军
We're allies

1640
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:56,820
战争才刚开始
and the war has just begun.

1641
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:16,110
我们不能把核芯素交给德赖登
You know we can't give the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1642
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,230
你想当英雄了吗 汉·索罗
Joining the cause, Han Solo?

1643
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:20,630
我只想活着离开
Just trying to make it out alive.

1644
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:21,800
有计划了
Got a plan?

1645
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,300
对 想到一个
Yeah, beginning of one.

1646
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:24,000
既能让我们拿到钱
Way to get our money

1647
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,880
又能摆脱
and get out from under the thumb

1648
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:27,180
血红黎明控制
of Crimson Dawn at the same time.

1649
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,750
顺便还能把你的女朋友抢过来
Maybe get your girlfriend back while we're at it.

1650
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:33,360
你惹不起德赖登的
You don't tangle with Dryden.

1651
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,690
他跟我们不一样  他是真的养着一群雇佣兵
Because unlike us, he actually does travel

1652
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:39,450
他有自己的军队
with hired guns, his own private army.

1653
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:41,510
恩菲斯也有军队啊
So does Enfys.

1654
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:43,870
听着 这是我目前的想法
Listen, here's what I got so far.

1655
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,790
你说他们在聊什么
What do you think they're saying?

1656
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,950
他会想办法帮助你
He's gonna try to help you.

1657
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,400
知道了
I see.

1658
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:05,400
这个计划漏洞百出 成功的几率很小
Lot of ways it could go south, and only one where it doesn't.

1659
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,900
所以才需要你啊
That's why I need my partner.

1660
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,990
这次就算了
Not this time.

1661
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:15,790
我要走了
I'm leaving.

1662
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:17,920
你要不傻就跟我走
If you're smart, you'll come with me.

1663
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,180
我以为你不喜欢逃亡呢
I thought you didn't believe in running.

1664
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,450
总比死了好
I prefer it to dying.

1665
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,520
如果出现奇迹了 你真的活了下来
If by some miracle you make it out of here,

1666
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,120
去塔图因找我
find me on Tatooine.

1667
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,880
为什么要去塔图因
What's on Tatooine?

1668
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,920
听说有个活
Heard about a job,

1669
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,750
有个黑帮老大在招兵买马
big shot gangster putting together a crew.

1670
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,890
最后一次了
That'll be the one.

1671
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:03,870
你说什么
The one?

1672
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:06,070
我最后的生意
My last score.

1673
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:07,770
我得先还了那笔债
Yeah, I still got some debts to pay

1674
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,380
才能返回格利安塞姆
before I can head back to Glee Anselm

1675
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:13,070
去学会弹梵弦琴
and get into the valachord.

1676
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,710
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

1677
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,610
他正等着你们呢
He's waiting for you.

1678
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:50,710
谢谢 托特
Thanks, Toht.

1679
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,150
交出武器
Weapons.

1680
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:55,450
我没带武器
I didn't bring 'em.

1681
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,460
他们没问题的
They're fine.

1682
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:04,610
我们会赢的
We're gonna win.

1683
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,960
这不是赌牌 汉
It's not that kind of game, Han.

1684
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,300
你的目标不是赢
The object isn't to win.

1685
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:14,460
而是尽力活到最后
It's just to stay in it as long as you can.

1686
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:19,080
有些事儿你不懂
You don't know everything.

1687
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,320
是啊
No.

1688
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:25,930
但是懂的比你多
Just a bit more than you.

1689
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,050
我就知道
I knew it!

1690
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,890
我的人都说
My men, they all said,

1691
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,240
他们绝对不可能成功
"There's no way they pull this off."

1692
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,930
琦拉能力不行 他们是这么说的
"Qi'ra's not ready." That's what they said,

1693
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:43,060
我可对你有信心
but I had faith anyway.

1694
01:46:45,050 --> 01:46:46,320
贝克特呢
Where's Beckett?

1695
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,780
贝克特没能活下来
Beckett didn't make it.

1696
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:52,730
怎么了
Tell me.

1697
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:55,160
在科舍尔发生了意外
Job took a bad turn on Kessel.

1698
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:57,370
他牺牲自己救了我
He died saving my life.

1699
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:59,520
你怎么样 没事儿吧
How are you holding up? You all right?

1700
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:00,280
我还好
I'm okay.

1701
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:01,970
那就好
All right, good.

1702
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:03,970
尝尝 科洛爪鱼
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1703
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,340
不用 谢谢
- No. Thank you. - No?

1704
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:07,940
虽然贝克特有一些缺点
You know, whatever Beckett's shortcomings may have been,

1705
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,960
但是我一直很钦佩他
I always admired him.

1706
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,720
他是个有原则的人
He was a man of principles.

1707
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:13,190
当他做出承诺 他会兑现
When he made a commitment, he honored it

1708
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:15,510
我想我们都应该感到欣慰
and I think we can all take solace

1709
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:17,990
要知道
in knowing how proud he would've been

1710
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:21,560
如果他看到你们以他为榜样该有多自豪
to see you here, following his example.

1711
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:23,270
汉和丘巴卡的表现值得赞赏
Han and Chewbacca behaved admirably.

1712
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,740
等他们有了自己的船
They'll make reliable smugglers,

1713
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:26,070
将会成为
should we ever have the need

1714
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:27,860
可靠的走私客
when they get their own ship.

1715
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:30,230
琦拉 过来
Qi'ra. Come here.

1716
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:33,920
我们很希望能有机会
We'd really appreciate the opportunity

1717
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:35,680
再次为您效劳
to work for you again, sir.

1718
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,080
先生
I would've been inconsolable

1719
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:38,920
如果你发生意外我会伤心死的 宝贝儿
if anything had happened to you, my dear.

1720
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,330
我这辈子没有遇到其他人
I have no one else in my life

1721
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,320
能像你那样值得我这么信任
that I trust in the way that I trust you.

1722
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:52,120
我想我们领完赏金
Well, I guess we'll just take our payment

1723
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:52,920
就该告辞了
and get going.

1724
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,040
您肯定还要去消灭竞争对手
I'm sure you've got competitors to crush...

1725
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,210
什么
What?

1726
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:56,720
还要垄断黑市
...and black markets to dominate.

1727
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,090
先给我看看带来的货
Oh. Show me what you've brought me first.

1728
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,960
你想让我打开
You want me to open it?

1729
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,000
是的 汉 我正是这么想的
Oh, yes, Han. I really do.

1730
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,930
拿一罐给我
Bring me one.

1731
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:34,390
这可不是个好主意 德赖登
I don't think that's a good idea, Dryden.

1732
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:36,790
这东西可是非常易爆的
It's very explosive stuff.

1733
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:39,570
我的要求从来不提第二遍 汉
I never ask for anything twice, Han.

1734
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,730
小心
Careful.

1735
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,630
真是太神奇了
It's magnificent.

1736
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,440
你怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

1737
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,400
可不简单
Wasn't easy.

1738
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,390
不 我是说你怎么把这玩意做到…
No, I mean, how'd you do it?

1739
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:14,490
跟真货一模一样
It looks exactly like the real thing.

1740
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:17,420
因为它就是真货
That's 'cause it is the real thing.

1741
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,150
我得说
Yes, and I'm saying

1742
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:20,310
我本来会相信你的 做的太像了
I would believe you. It's that good.

1743
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:22,140
但我的手下已经把你的计划告诉我了
But my associate already told me

1744
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,990
你想骗走我的钱
about your plan to rob me of my money

1745
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,810
把真的核芯素交给恩菲斯·内斯特
and give the real coaxium to Enfys Nest.

1746
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:29,510
德赖登先生 我不知道你在说什么
Dryden, I don't know what you're thinking

1747
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,060
或者琦拉是怎么告诉你的 我绝不会…
or what Qi'ra may have told you...

1748
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:33,450
这事跟琦拉没关系
No, not Qi'ra. Not Qi'ra.

1749
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:34,740
琦拉最后
Qi'ra, it turns out

1750
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:36,430
因为你心软了
has a weak spot for you,

1751
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:38,260
这事我们稍后再谈
and we'll deal with that later.

1752
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:42,220
我说的是我的另外一位手下
No, I'm talking about my other associate.

1753
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:44,260
麻烦你进来跟我们见见吧
Can you come in and join us, please?

1754
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:59,280
我真的很抱歉 孩子
I am sorry, kid.

1755
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:03,810
为什么这样做
Why?

1756
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:04,980
行了
Come on.

1757
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,010
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

1758
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:08,040
你就是听不进去
You weren't paying attention.

1759
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:10,810
我跟你说过 谁也别信
I told you, "Don't trust anybody."

1760
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:13,940
我说错了吗
Am I wrong about that?

1761
01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:19,890
离那玩意远点
Back away from that.

1762
01:50:19,890 --> 01:50:21,790
让我看到你的爪子
Put your paws where I can see 'em.

1763
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:23,760
检查那个盖子
Check that lid.

1764
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:27,270
聪明
Clever.

1765
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:29,200
太晚了
It's too late.

1766
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,640
核芯素已精炼好 在恩菲斯手上了
Coaxium's refined, and Enfys has it.

1767
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,970
我们考虑到那边了
Well, we figured that.

1768
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,930
放下武器
Drop your weapons.

1769
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:56,440
结束了 抓到了
It's over. We got them.

1770
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:57,760
我们拿到货了
And there we have it.

1771
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:59,700
干的漂亮 埃蒙 谢谢你
Excellent work, Aemon, thank you.

1772
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,420
琦拉 帮我一下
Qi'ra, help me.

1773
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:05,100
告诉我该怎么做
Tell me what to do.

1774
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:07,920
要是你会怎么做
What would you do

1775
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:12,050
如果你在这个世界上
if the person you most trusted in the world

1776
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:14,090
最信任的人…背叛了你
betrayed you?

1777
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,260
我会想知道为什么
I would want to know why.

1778
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,630
是出于一时的软弱
If it was a moment of weakness

1779
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,810
还是有其它原因
or something else.

1780
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:24,860
然后呢
And then what?

1781
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,430
然后我会要求那个人
And then, I would ask that person

1782
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,720
牺牲他最钟爱的东西
to prove their loyalty

1783
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:35,460
以此来证明他的忠诚
by sacrificing something they love.

1784
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:46,020
提醒过你要提防她
I tried to warn you about her.

1785
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:48,760
有件事你说错了 你知道吗
You know, you're wrong about one thing.

1786
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:50,150
什么事
What?

1787
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:52,490
你说的话我听进去了
I was paying attention.

1788
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,800
你跟丘伊说 人心是很好猜的
You told Chewie people are predictable.

1789
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,430
你也不例外
You're no exception.

1790
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:06,220
是空的
It's empty.

1791
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:07,730
箱子是空的
The case is empty.

1792
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:10,140
怎么回事儿 埃蒙 出什么事儿了
Aemon, what's going on? What's happening there?

1793
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,680
埃蒙
Aemon?

1794
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:12,710
回答我
Talk to me.

1795
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:41,410
我希望你没有把所有部下都派出去
I hope you didn't send all your fancy enforcers

1796
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:43,110
要不然你在这边人手可能有点不够了
because that would leave you

1797
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,570
如果那边的箱子是空的
a little shorthanded around here.

1798
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:47,960
那么
So,

1799
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:52,420
真的核芯素
if that case is empty, then the real coaxium...

1800
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,370
只属于我们中的一个人
Leaves here with one of us.

1801
01:52:59,430 --> 01:53:00,810
贝克特 你在干什么
Beckett, what are you doing?

1802
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:01,860
动脑子想想
Thinking.

1803
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:03,260
我现在是唯一一个
And I prefer to be the only one

1804
01:53:03,330 --> 01:53:05,150
拿着枪的人
holding a blaster while I'm doing it.

1805
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,800
汉 拿起那罐核芯素
Han, grab that coaxium,

1806
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:08,100
放进盒子里
put it in the case.

1807
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:09,880
大个子你跟着我走
Big stuff, you're coming with me.

1808
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:12,930
不要这样 贝克特
Don't do this, Beckett.

1809
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:14,720
- 我们有约在先 - 是啊
- We had a deal. - Yeah.

1810
01:53:14,730 --> 01:53:15,580
对不起
I'm sorry,

1811
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,220
我同样是个投机者
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1812
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:19,800
我想你们都能理解我
I mean, you of all people understand that.

1813
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,020
快 我们走
Come on, let's go.

1814
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,920
你犯了一个大错误
You're making a huge mistake.

1815
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,270
反正不是第一次
Won't be my first.

1816
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,890
那将是你最后一次
It's gonna be your last.

1817
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,330
也许吧
Maybe.

1818
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,670
你怎么这么悲观
Why you gotta be so negative?

1819
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:44,790
汉
Han,

1820
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:46,140
现在可是一个
now's as good a time as any

1821
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,240
重新评估我们关系的好机会
to reevaluate our relationship.

1822
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:49,750
怎么说
How so?

1823
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:52,380
我刚才在想
I was just thinking,

1824
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:55,380
为什么我们俩不联手一起去找贝克特
why don't we join forces and go get Beckett together?

1825
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:58,250
这是一个好主意 就这么办了 你先去
That is a great idea. Let's do it. You go first.

1826
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:01,530
汉
Oh, Han.

1827
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,560
你赢不了我的 汉 就算你赢了
You can't win, Han, and even if you could,

1828
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,820
后半辈子
you'd spend the rest of your life

1829
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:33,140
你也没法好好过
looking over your shoulder.

1830
01:54:34,230 --> 01:54:35,230
你知道吗
You know what?

1831
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:38,160
我已经开始习惯这种生活了
I'm kind of getting used to the idea.

1832
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:47,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

1833
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:48,600
汉 她做过的事
Han, she's done things that

1834
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:51,400
你永远都无法理解 但是我理解
you could never understand, but I do.

1835
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:54,080
我完全能理解她
I understand her completely.

1836
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:57,340
一旦你加入了血红黎明
Once you're a part of Crimson Dawn,

1837
01:54:57,490 --> 01:54:59,140
就出不来了
you can't leave.

1838
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,890
不是真的
It's not true.

1839
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:02,420
我了解你
I know you.

1840
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:04,720
这是我学到的
It's what I was taught.

1841
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:06,610
找到对手的弱点
Find your opponent's weakness,

1842
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:08,020
利用它
and use it,

1843
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:10,160
而今天…
and today...

1844
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,500
对手是你
I'm yours.

1845
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:41,200
我不得不…
I had to.

1846
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,860
对 不 我是说
Yeah. No, I mean, you did...

1847
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:46,480
你做到了
You did.

1848
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:50,740
你得去追上贝克特和丘巴卡
Beckett and Chewbacca, you have to go after them.

1849
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,000
那你怎么办
What are you gonna do?

1850
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,760
如果我们把核芯素都交给了恩菲斯
Well, if we give all the coaxium to Enfys,

1851
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:57,540
就得想其它办法买船了
we're gonna need something to buy our ship with.

1852
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,920
- 琦拉 - 去救丘巴卡
- Qi'ra... - Go and save Chewbacca.

1853
01:56:13,970 --> 01:56:17,040
他需要你 而你也会需要他的
He needs you and you're gonna need him, too.

1854
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:24,510
微笑
Smile.

1855
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,640
我就是这样
That's the word.

1856
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,950
每次我想象
Whenever I imagined myself

1857
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,890
自己跟你一起冒险的时候
off with you on some adventure...

1858
01:56:34,330 --> 01:56:36,400
我就会微笑
Always makes me smile.

1859
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,710
快去 我马上就来
Go. I'm right behind you.

1860
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:38,890
什么事
Yes?

1861
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:42,290
我遗憾地向您汇报 德赖登·沃斯已死
I regret to inform you that Dryden Vos is dead,

1862
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:44,260
凶手是他雇来
murdered by the thief he hired

1863
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:45,860
偷核芯素的盗贼
to steal the coaxium shipment,

1864
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:47,120
他的旧友
his friend,

1865
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,180
托拜厄斯·贝克特
Tobias Beckett.

1866
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:51,300
这样啊
Is that so?

1867
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:55,320
那批货现在在哪
Where is the shipment now?

1868
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:56,860
不见了
Gone.

1869
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:57,890
贝克特拿走了
Beckett took it.

1870
01:57:57,970 --> 01:58:00,610
除了我 其他人都死了
Slaughtered the others. I alone survived.

1871
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:06,620
凶手不可能单枪匹马吧
One man couldn't have done this alone.

1872
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:09,190
我当时不在场
I wasn't there,

1873
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,830
要不然我还能救他
but if I had been, perhaps I could have saved him.

1874
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:23,490
驾驶飞船来达索米尔找我
Bring the ship and come to me on Dathomir

1875
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:25,520
你和我将决定
and you and I will then decide

1876
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:28,320
如何处置叛徒
what to do about the traitor, Beckett,

1877
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:30,810
贝克特和他的同伙
and his accomplices.

1878
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,070
我马上出发
I'm on my way.

1879
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:37,880
琦拉
Qi'ra,

1880
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,210
你和我...
you and I

1881
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:42,510
今后要
will be working much more closely

1882
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:44,590
更加紧密地开展工作
from now on.

1883
01:59:14,690 --> 01:59:16,820
不得不说 你很执着
You're relentless. I'll give you that.

1884
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:20,320
我尽快赶过来了 伙计
Came as fast as I could, buddy.

1885
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,230
德赖登死了吧
Dryden dead?

1886
01:59:24,230 --> 01:59:26,070
是琦拉杀的
Qi'ra kill him?

1887
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:30,420
你还是不明白 孩子
Still don't get it, do you, kid?

1888
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:32,900
她这样做不是为了你
It was never about you.

1889
01:59:33,170 --> 01:59:34,740
是为了她自己
She's a survivor.

1890
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:37,470
你知道你的问题吗
You know what your problem is?

1891
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:39,540
你以为所有人都跟你一样
You think everybody's like you.

1892
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:41,990
你不一样 孩子
Not you, kid.

1893
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:43,430
你跟我完全不一样
You're nothing like me.

1894
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,080
我希望你还记得我的话
I hope you're still paying attention

1895
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,150
因为现在我要告诉你最重要的
because now I'm gonna tell you the most important...

1896
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,770
你学聪明了 孩子
You made the smart move, kid.

1897
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:08,330
至少这次很聪明
For once.

1898
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:11,340
我是想杀了你的
I woulda killed you.

1899
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:23,600
我是真的想学会弹梵弦琴
I really was gonna learn to play that valachord.

1900
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,920
我知道
I know.

1901
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,580
好了 都装好了
That's it. It's all loaded.

1902
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:25,180
你知道那是什么吗
Do you know what that really is?

1903
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:26,160
知道
Yeah.

1904
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:29,140
价值六千万信用点的精炼核芯素
About 60 million credits worth of refined coaxium.

1905
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:30,460
不
No.

1906
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,900
这是一份催生新事物的血液
It's the blood that brings life to something new.

1907
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:35,240
是吗 什么新事物
Yeah, what?

1908
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,280
一支起义军
A rebellion.

1909
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,300
你可以加入我们
You could come with us, you know.

1910
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,630
我们很需要你这样的战士和领袖
We need warriors and leaders like you.

1911
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:50,340
也许有一天你会改变主意的
Maybe someday you'll feel different.

1912
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:53,000
你可别傻等着 孩子
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1913
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:08,960
别弄丢了
Don't lose that.

1914
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:22,850
很少有人亲眼见过
Very few people have actually seen

1915
02:03:23,010 --> 02:03:24,360
星洞星云
the StarCave Nebula.

1916
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:25,730
美得窒息
It's breathtaking.

1917
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:27,240
就像你的眼睛
Not unlike your eyes.

1918
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:29,470
你听说过彼此缠绕的天体吗
How much do you know about intertwined celestial bodies?

1919
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:31,690
我刚好是这方面的专家
Because I happen to be something of an authority.

1920
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:33,890
其实呢 我…
By the way...

1921
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:41,570
汉
Han!

1922
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:42,820
你还活着
You're alive!

1923
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:44,150
是的 多亏了你啊
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1924
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:45,910
我早应该让丘伊把你的胳膊拧下来
I should have Chewie rip your arms off.

1925
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:47,440
是不是 丘伊 动手
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1926
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:48,620
汉 我们是朋友
Hey, Han! We are friends.

1927
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:50,330
别这样 我们是朋友 对吗
You know that. We're friends. All right?

1928
02:03:55,530 --> 02:03:57,410
瞧给你吓的
Oh, look at you.

1929
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:59,300
真以为他要拧下你胳膊来呢
Thought he was gonna rip your arms off.

1930
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:00,380
我知道你在逗我
I knew you were kidding.

1931
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,230
你压根不知道
No, you didn't.

1932
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:03,050
- 那么我那份呢 - 你那份
- So, where's my cut? - Your cut?

1933
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:06,370
不 恐怕没了 我们差点就挂了
No, I don't think so. We barely made it out alive.

1934
02:04:06,370 --> 02:04:08,170
我们只拿到这些了
All we ended up with was that.

1935
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:12,120
估计这些值一万吧
Figure it's worth about 10,000,

1936
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:13,840
应该是够下个注了
maybe enough for a decent buy-in.

1937
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:17,400
你想再赌一局
You want a rematch?

1938
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:20,040
为什么不呢
Why not?

1939
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:25,910
现在弃牌
You fold now,

1940
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:26,850
你可能还有钱给自己
you walk away with enough

1941
02:04:26,850 --> 02:04:28,950
买一艘小船
to get yourself your own little ship.

1942
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:30,870
你跟牌
You call,

1943
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:33,670
你又得输个精光了
I'm gonna clean you out again.

1944
02:04:46,190 --> 02:04:47,520
我觉得我手气还不错
I don't know, I'm feeling lucky.

1945
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:54,810
我看你是真的迷上千年隼了吧
You really have it bad for the Falcon, don't you?

1946
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,510
两厢情愿 相信我 它是属于我的
It's mutual, trust me. She belongs with me.

1947
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:09,650
你的牌都准备好了吗 老兄
You got everything you need there, pal?

1948
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,940
真不错
Not bad.

1949
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,960
真不错 你知道吗
Not bad. You know,

1950
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:27,810
要是如果你手上有了这张小绿牌
if you'd only had this little green sylop,

1951
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:29,300
你就可以赢我了
you would've beaten this.

1952
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:38,120
公平公正啊 宝贝 非常公平
Fair and square, baby. Fair and square.

1953
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:50,350
贝克特之前跟我说
Beckett said he heard about this

1954
02:05:50,350 --> 02:05:52,640
有位头儿在招人干活儿
very big gangster putting together a job.

1955
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:55,590
不 我跟你说啊
No, I'm telling ya,

1956
02:05:55,670 --> 02:05:56,960
那活肯定不错
it's gonna be great.

1957
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:58,940
我什么时候坑过你
When have I ever steered you wrong?
