2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,889
Come on.

3
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,799
Come on!

4
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,560
Don't let him get away!

5
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,692
Get inside now!

6
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,952
Hurry up! You're late!

7
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,699
Proxima's gonna
have your hide.

8
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,664
Get back in the den.

9
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,913
Look what I stole!

10
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,767
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!

11
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,778
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

12
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,802
Hey, give it back!

13
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,947
It belongs to
whoever's holding it!

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,971
And that's not you!

15
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,056
Lex!

16
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,515
Full Sabacc!

17
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,719
Idiot's Array.

18
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,870
What? Let me see that!

19
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,934
Nope, it's my card.

20
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,094
You cheat.

21
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,974
Han!

22
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,396
You were gone too long!

23
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,887
I knew something must've
gone wrong.

24
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,566
This is nothing.
You should see them.

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,981
Look down here!

26
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,949
All right, listen.

27
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,387
I was in the middle
of the exchange,

28
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,531
I'm handing over the coaxium

29
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,344
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed 'em.

30
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,456
How?

31
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,140
I ran away,
then I boosted their speeder.

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,311
What, are we going somewhere?

33
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,292
Yeah, anywhere we want.

34
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,416
You held on to
one of the vials?

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,590
Han's back!

36
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,585
This, this is worth...

37
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,843
Five, six hundred credits.

38
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,671
That's more than you said
we'd need.

39
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,931
To buy our way out
of the control zone.

40
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,433
And off Corellia.

41
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,686
Han, this could work.

42
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,855
This is gonna work.

43
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,343
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

44
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,437
This is it.

45
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,728
What are we waiting for?

46
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,069
There he is.
Hey, you two!

47
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,113
Look who we have here.

48
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,906
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?

49
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,121
I was just on my way
to see Lady Proxima.

50
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,911
You have our money?

51
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,331
What a night I had.

52
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,444
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

53
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,468
Search him.

54
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,343
Hold still, scrumrat!

55
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,718
Easy.

56
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,308
Come on.

57
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,717
All right.

58
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,764
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

59
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,330
Well, what happened?

60
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,664
I'll tell you what happened.

61
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,750
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.

62
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,923
The money?

63
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,257
- They kept it.
- And my coaxium?

64
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,136
They kept that, too.

65
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,700
But we learned
a very valuable lesson.

66
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,930
We cannot trust those guys.

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,095
So you expect me to believe

68
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,643
that you walked away
with nothing!

69
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,855
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

70
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,982
To me, that's a lot.

71
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,895
I trusted you
with a simple task,

72
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,150
and all I'm hearing
are excuses.

73
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,869
There must be consequences
for disobedience

74
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,406
or else you never learn.

75
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,913
You know what?

76
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,994
I don't think
I'm ever gonna learn.

77
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,629
What did you say?

78
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,426
I said, next time
somebody hits me,

79
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,077
I hit 'em back.

80
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,387
Not if I shoot you.

81
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,438
Moloch, wait!

82
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,181
Don't!

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,482
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

84
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,644
We pulled you
out of that horror,

85
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,228
gave you a home.

86
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,614
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!

87
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,118
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

88
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,698
We will make it up to you.

89
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,850
Coaxium is precious.

90
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,206
Scrumrats like you come cheap.

91
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,334
Everybody, stand back!

92
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,745
What's that supposed to be?

93
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,663
This is a thermal detonator

94
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,707
that I just armed.

95
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,376
- That's a rock!
- No, it's not.

96
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,635
Yes, it is!

97
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,966
And you just made

98
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,342
a clicking sound
with your mouth.

99
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,007
Please tell me
this isn't your plan.

100
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,516
No, this is.

101
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,065
- Get in!
- An M-68?

102
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,231
- Nice, right?
- I love it!

103
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,034
Whoa!

104
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,770
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,101
we're gonna be on it.

106
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,064
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.

107
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,907
I'm gonna be a pilot.

108
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,366
We can get our own ship.

109
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,277
See the galaxy, all of it.

110
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,665
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

111
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,710
Ever.

112
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,096
Thought we'd get
a little more of a head start.

113
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,399
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

114
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,531
This is a secure area.

115
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,408
You must have
proper clearance.

116
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,164
Stop at once!
You must follow the proper...

117
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,418
Protocol.

118
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,421
Damn! That stinger's fast.

119
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,083
Yeah, but we're faster, right?

120
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,341
I hope so.

121
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,749
Pull over!

122
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,001
Han, no,
we're not gonna make it!

123
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,025
Oh, yeah?

124
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,566
Han, I'm telling you,
it's too tight!

125
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,194
Watch this.

126
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,585
Bring the hounds.

127
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,549
After them!

128
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,595
Come on!

129
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,838
We gotta move.

130
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,679
Do notjoin the line

131
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,898
if you don't have
a boarding pass.

132
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,732
No access without ID chip.

133
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,030
All droids must be registered.

134
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,329
Move along. Move along.

135
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,867
Stand down. Do not resist!

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,745
- Stop struggling.
- Let me go!

137
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,839
Take his arm.

138
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,047
I got him.

139
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,533
Take him to cell 3B.

140
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,163
This way, come on.

141
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,670
Keep moving. Hold it, hold it.

142
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,014
Next.

143
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,895
Han, they're here.

144
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,669
Hey, what are you...

145
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,731
We're almost there.

146
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,341
- Just hold on to me.
- Next.

147
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,572
Don't look back.

148
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,734
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,

149
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,410
figure out where we're going.

150
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,658
Anywhere the Empire isn't.
Wherever we go,

151
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,308
it can't be worse
than where we've been.

152
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,625
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

153
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,878
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,

154
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,377
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.

155
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,086
That's not gonna happen.

156
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,626
I won't let it.

157
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,638
For luck?

158
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,932
Damn right.

159
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,254
You heard him. Let's go.

160
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,278
Next.

161
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,279
ID chips.

162
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,820
Funny thing,
we don't have 'em.

163
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,994
We have this.

164
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,369
Refined hyperfuel.

165
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,785
It's worth at least
800 credits, maybe more.

166
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,867
You could be detained
just for having that.

167
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,918
What good would
that do anybody?

168
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,871
Let us through,
it's all yours.

169
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,632
The coaxium, now.

170
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,517
As we're going through,
not before.

171
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,734
Do it.

172
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,103
Just do it, do it.

173
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,196
Not so fast, Qi'ra! Come on!

174
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,327
Wait!
Open the door!

175
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,216
Security! Security,
there has been a breach!

176
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,410
Open the door!

177
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,667
- Run! Run!
- Get your hands off of her!

178
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,753
Run!

179
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,790
Get your hands off of her!

180
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,664
Qi'ra!

181
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,174
Run, Han! Go!

182
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,668
Keep moving.

183
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,841
Qi'ra!

184
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,015
Run!

185
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,327
Traveler has been apprehended.

186
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,844
Qi'ra, I'll come back!
I'll come back!

187
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,543
All units,
there has been a breach.

188
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,480
Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.

189
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,882
One got through
the gate! Look over there!

190
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,826
Someone
got through the checkpoint.

191
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,869
- Keep an eye on that gate.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,354
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

193
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,119
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

194
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,288
Hey, wait!

195
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,293
- Hey!
- Come with us.

196
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,803
He's still
out there. Keep looking.

197
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,186
You there, stop!

198
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,760
- Show me some identification.
- Please. Please. No, no!

199
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,982
Do not resist.

200
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,482
Be a part of
something. Join the Empire.

201
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,494
Explore new worlds.
Learn valuable skills.

202
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,997
Bring order and unity
to the galaxy!

203
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,709
Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.

204
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,504
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?

205
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,901
If you apply
for the Imperial Navy,

206
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,587
but most recruits
go into the infantry.

207
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,969
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Best in the galaxy.

208
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,675
You there, come with us.

209
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,801
Who, me?

210
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,427
We have a few questions
to ask you.

211
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,467
How long is that gonna take?

212
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,807
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

213
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,438
Why, have you got
somewhere to be?

214
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,394
Yeah, back here,
as soon as I can.

215
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,690
Don't hear that much.
What's your name, son?

216
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,114
Han.

217
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,981
Han what?

218
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,577
Who are your people?

219
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,408
I don't have people.
I'm alone.

220
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,627
Han...

221
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,793
Solo.

222
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,343
Approved.

223
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,508
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

224
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,094
Good luck, Han Solo.

225
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,680
We'll have you flying
in no time.

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,699
Your Empire needs you.
Troopers forward!

227
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,530
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!

228
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,537
Almost where?
Where are we going?

229
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,415
Just over that last ridge.
Victory is...

230
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,513
My legs! My leg!

231
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,480
Hey, Beckett,
you said we were here

232
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,655
to pull a quickjob.

233
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,738
- Yeah.
- Well, this ain't a quickjob!

234
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,197
It's a war!

235
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,825
It's always
something with you.

236
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,500
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.

237
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,749
Forward operations
must be this way.

238
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,242
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

239
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,170
Yeah, go that way and die!

240
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,551
That's exactly what happened
to the major!

241
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,088
Who's the ranking officer now?

242
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,052
You are, Captain.

243
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,551
He's got you there.

244
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,601
So what's the plan,
Captain Beckett?

245
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,017
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

246
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,981
I'll take this mouthy scooch

247
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,154
and we'll go around
to the right

248
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,404
and maybe we'll get lucky.

249
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,055
Luck's got
nothin' to do with it.

250
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,485
Wait! One question!

251
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,196
- You wanna live, sparky?
- Very much.

252
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,490
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

253
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,037
Let's go!

254
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,470
Captain.

255
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,384
T-15s are down.
We walk from here.

256
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,894
Captain.

257
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,140
I'm Han.

258
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,645
Nobody cares.

259
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,149
Thanks for your help
back there.

260
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,530
You did all right.

261
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,153
I was trained
in aerial combat...

262
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,034
You want some advice?

263
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,536
Get the hell away from here.

264
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,160
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.

265
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,827
What company do you command?

266
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,332
None of your business company.

267
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,293
And we're full up.

268
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,336
Stick to soldiering, kid.

269
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,042
You don't want
any part of this.

270
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,717
Hang on, guys!

271
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,307
Attention!

272
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,397
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

273
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,025
I want an advance party
of ten men.

274
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,811
Great, more mud.

275
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,566
What was that?

276
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,816
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

277
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,948
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,

278
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,862
install a regime
loyal to the Emperor,

279
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,368
and eradicate the hostiles.

280
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,201
It's their planet,
we're the hostiles.

281
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,707
You got a problem, trooper?

282
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,247
No problem, sir.

283
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,126
Moving out.

284
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,886
To the southern
marshlands! Move out!

285
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,218
You heard 'em!
Let's move out!

286
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,753
Mmm. Looks like
they're running sorties

287
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,777
every 30 minutes.

288
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,187
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,

289
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,821
signalman, pilot.

290
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,364
Hell, I'll just
take 'em all out.

291
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,820
What are we looking at?

292
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,447
You have a talent for
sticking your nose in

293
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,702
where it doesn't belong.

294
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,075
I just couldn't help
but notice

295
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,585
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

296
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,620
So either you heal real quick

297
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,332
or you stole it off
a dead man.

298
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,841
You're not Imperial Army.

299
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,302
You're thieves here
to steal equipment

300
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,720
for a job and I want in.

301
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,639
- Well, now we gotta shoot him.
- No.

302
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,433
Snap his neck. It's less mess.

303
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,765
Or you take me with you.

304
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,521
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

305
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,058
I was boosting AV-21s
when I was ten.

306
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,814
I'm a driver, a flyer,

307
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,526
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

308
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,736
What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?

309
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,243
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy

310
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,821
for having a mind of my own.

311
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,241
But I am a great pilot.
And I gotta get home.

312
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,876
This guy is nuts.
No one goes back to Corellia.

313
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,503
I got a reason.

314
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,755
We've already
got a great pilot.

315
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,375
The Ardennian.

316
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,464
Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.

317
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,216
I'm an Imperial trooper.

318
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,366
Oh, really?
A couple of your arms

319
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,390
popped out of your butt

320
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,841
and hiked up your pants,
trooper.

321
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,934
Oh, yeah?

322
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,205
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

323
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,891
I've already been away
too long.

324
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,565
Just give me a shot.

325
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,940
Whoa. Hold it.

326
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,693
Well, if you're
not interested in me,

327
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,981
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

328
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,739
Blackmail.

329
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,123
Lieutenant.

330
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,208
Captain.

331
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,247
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.

332
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,373
Take him.

333
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,546
Wait.

334
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,040
I should've known.
This one's a troublemaker.

335
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,425
And a liar.

336
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,612
Don't believe
anything he says.

337
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,822
- Don't go anywhere without me.
- All right, let's go.

338
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,053
Feed him to the beast.

339
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,680
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?

340
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,926
- Hold on!
- Move it!

341
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,079
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

342
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,503
- He was lying!
- Quiet!

343
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,815
Don't care.

344
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,900
Haven't fed him in three days.

345
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,464
Should be fun.

346
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,655
Oh! Hey!
Hey, big fella.

347
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,412
Just calm down.
Take it easy.

348
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,868
We're on the same side.

349
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,248
You like treats?

350
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,336
Help!
Let me out of here!

351
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,712
Let me out of here!

352
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,214
A-ha! Gotcha!

353
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,634
Ahhh!

354
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,235
Ah, this was
just getting good.

355
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,945
- He killed him too fast.
- Yeah!

356
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,405
Kill him slower.

357
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,659
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

358
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,120
Wait! Wait!

359
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,122
Yeah, I speak a little.

360
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,485
Now just listen to me, you...

361
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,670
You dumb Wookiee!

362
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,219
Me have plan of break out.

363
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,519
You and I freedom make...
by secret battle of pretend.

364
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,728
Look... big... stick...

365
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,228
Yes, yes!

366
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,697
No, no, no, no!

367
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,993
Do it!

368
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,527
Come on.

369
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,822
Oh, no!

370
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,991
Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.

371
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,875
Let me out of here!

372
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,411
I can't take it anymore!

373
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,683
- Oh, no! Stop, please!
- That's it. Get him!

374
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,260
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?

375
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,482
See what happens
when you listen to me?

376
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,484
Hey, what are you doing?

377
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,485
Ow.

378
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,494
Follow me!

379
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,830
Wait, wait.

380
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,590
Come here.
Listen to me.

381
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,820
You don't understand, okay?

382
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:07,904
I have some very good friends

383
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,030
waiting for me
at that airfield.

384
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,386
They're leaving right now.

385
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,013
That's our one way
off this mud ball.

386
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,764
If you wanna live,
we go that way.

387
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,142
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

388
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,395
But right now,
that's the way you go!

389
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,106
Trust me!

390
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,519
Val, let's go!

391
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,694
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!

392
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,409
No wonder
they're such lousy pilots.

393
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,140
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,

394
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,204
you can't hear each other!

395
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,746
I'll be damned.

396
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,256
Hey, look who's back!

397
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,506
Unbelievable!

398
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,292
Wait!

399
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,132
Wait!

400
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,051
Whoa, is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!

401
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,385
I'll say it, I don't care.

402
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,095
This kid's growing on me.

403
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,098
Wait!

404
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,186
You know, we could always use

405
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,476
some muscle
on a job like this.

406
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,690
Don't even think about it!

407
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,355
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

408
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,114
than curled up
in a Wookiee's lap.

409
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,448
I told you!

410
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,618
Very good friends!

411
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,604
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

412
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,557
Thanks for helping me
get outta there.

413
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,684
No, they only took you
because of me.

414
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,570
Hey!

415
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,522
I got us
a real sweet deal here.

416
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,656
We do this one job
with them,

417
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,692
we make some real money,

418
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,702
and then we're free.

419
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,955
When's the last time
you could say that?

420
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,661
Been a while for me, too.

421
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,251
So what's your name, anyway?

422
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,465
Chewbacca?

423
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,555
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

424
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,637
'cause I ain't saying that
every time.

425
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:07,959
Here it comes.
Take a look.

426
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,983
Yeah.

427
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,690
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

428
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,402
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

429
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,033
cable it up to the AT-hauler
and then...

430
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,819
Rio jams
their distress signal.

431
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,949
I blow the bridge,

432
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,600
the container slides
right off the track

433
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,957
and we sail away.

434
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,867
You trip that security beam,

435
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,286
wake up those Vipers,

436
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,371
it's liable to get
real spicy, real fast.

437
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,708
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

438
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:34,884
Enfys Nest.

439
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,634
What's an Enfys Nest?

440
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,045
I told you, we're way ahead

441
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,504
of the competition
on this one.

442
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,047
There's no way Enfys Nest

443
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,053
even knows
about this shipment.

444
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,718
Only my guy has the intel.

445
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,353
Well, you better be right.
Yeah?

446
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,731
Because sometimes,
you put your faith

447
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,353
in the wrong people.

448
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,650
Our whole future
depends on this one score

449
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,064
and you bring in amateurs.

450
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,510
In case you hadn't noticed,

451
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,741
we're a little shorthanded.

452
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,365
So we get who we need.

453
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,945
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

454
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,661
But, no, instead you're
putting our lives

455
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,116
in the hands of morons.

456
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,335
You guys morons?

457
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,665
No!

458
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,375
- No. See?
- We're not morons.

459
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,383
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

460
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,544
I'm not about to screw it up,
all right?

461
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,138
Oh, come on, Val!

462
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,841
He looks so sincere.

463
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,495
Plus, have you ever
tried to disinvite

464
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,640
a Wookiee to anything?

465
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,597
Not a good idea!

466
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,603
This is not funny!

467
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:33,058
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

468
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,854
And, besides,
do you see any other options?

469
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,424
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

470
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,065
Yeah, I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.

471
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,905
We're gonna clear our debts,

472
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,070
go back to Glee Anselm,

473
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,490
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

474
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,125
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

475
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,082
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.

476
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,462
So what's your sob story,
flyboy?

477
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,635
Who, me?

478
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,669
You're after something,
I know the look.

479
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,509
What is it?
Revenge?

480
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,970
No, it's not revenge.

481
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,350
Look at him.

482
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,010
If it's anything, it's a girl.

483
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,140
Oh, a girl!

484
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,643
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?

485
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,974
Does she have sharp teeth?

486
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,445
There was a girl.

487
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,574
But I got out, she didn't.

488
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,988
I swore to myself
I'd become a pilot,

489
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,701
get a ship,

490
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,161
go back and find her.

491
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,836
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.

492
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,248
How you know
she'll still be there?

493
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,254
I just know.

494
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,502
Personally, I refuse
to be tied down

495
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,337
by anyone,
though many have tried.

496
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,006
Come on, Rio.
You don't fool me.

497
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,384
Everybody needs somebody.

498
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,813
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.

499
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,614
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?

500
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,752
What was he saying?

501
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,383
He said the Wookiees
were enslaved

502
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,381
by the Empire,
taken off Kashyyyk.

503
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,297
He's searching for his, uh...

504
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,349
I don't know if he said
tribe or family.

505
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,677
What's the difference?

506
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,140
Show me how to do that.

507
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,768
The only thing
you need to learn to do

508
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,944
is do what I say
when I say it.

509
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,861
And this time tomorrow,

510
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,738
you'll have
more than enough

511
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,528
to buy your own ship.

512
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,218
Starting the clock.

513
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,762
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.

514
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,556
Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.

515
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,037
I'm fine!

516
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,791
Val, how's it going up there?

517
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,539
Never better.

518
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,021
Coaxium.

519
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,191
Enough to power a fleet!

520
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,485
Or blow us all
straight to hell!

521
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,536
All right, talk to me.

522
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,080
Is it a good day?

523
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,745
It's a great day!

524
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,502
Best day of your life,
my grabby friend!

525
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,957
I don't know,
you've never been

526
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,414
to a Mynock roast on Ardennia.

527
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,672
It's nuts!

528
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,426
Here they come!

529
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,132
Get down to the couplers!

530
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,922
Rio, fall back!

531
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,340
Well, that didn't
take 'em long.

532
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,738
Chewie!

533
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,419
You all right?

534
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,383
Little close there, buddy!

535
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,555
Han, what's the holdup?

536
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,854
All right, together.

537
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,151
Now!

538
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,607
All right!

539
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Oh!

540
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,869
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?

541
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,204
Just up here
planning my retirement.

542
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,480
Thinking about opening
a cantina

543
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,144
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?

544
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,706
Lowering the winch cables now!

545
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,933
I knew it! I told him!
Beckett!

546
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,477
He's coming!

547
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,155
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

548
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,952
Who's that?

549
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,454
Enfys Nest!

550
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,365
Marauders, pirates.

551
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,204
Come to snake the score
from under us.

552
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,786
Ready your harpoons.

553
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,170
Move in.

554
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,671
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.

555
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,379
Get off of my ship!

556
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,465
You still with us, brother?

557
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,133
Yeah, I'm okay.

558
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,472
Just nicked one of my
shoulders. It's nothing.

559
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,096
He's not okay.

560
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,232
Chewie!

561
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,193
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!

562
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,163
Han!

563
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,493
I'm on it!

564
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,135
Val!

565
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,046
Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.

566
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,181
Viper droids headed your way!

567
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,221
Rio?

568
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,140
Yeah, it looks worse
than it is.

569
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,392
Just gotta patch it up.

570
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,612
Maybe rest my eyes
for a minute.

571
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,713
Enough!
I'm going in.

572
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,656
You weren't lying, kid.

573
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,197
You're a hell of a pilot.

574
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,412
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

575
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,009
Beckett, we just lost a cable!

576
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,096
2. 1 to the bridge!

577
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,689
It's no good
to die alone, kid.

578
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,567
Val was right.

579
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,278
Rio?

580
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,723
Beckett, we're.8
from the bridge!

581
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,934
Val's still on the track!

582
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,100
Val, you gotta
get off that bridge!

583
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,358
We're here!

584
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,072
They got me pinned!

585
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,529
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

586
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,947
What?

587
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,238
It's been a ride, babe.

588
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,786
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

589
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,210
Val!

590
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,295
No!

591
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,381
No!

592
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,600
Chewie, now!

593
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,712
Beckett, I can't
pull it away from 'em.

594
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,549
They'll let go,
you fly straight!

595
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,140
Release your cables

596
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,804
or die!

597
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,062
We're too close.

598
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,230
I gotta release.

599
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,638
You do what I tell you, Han!

600
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,852
Chewie, grab the line!

601
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,266
Don't you do it!

602
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,736
Han!

603
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,442
You coward!

604
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,872
What the hell?

605
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,125
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!

606
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,708
You have any idea
what you've done?

607
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,498
We were not stealing
for ourselves,

608
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,258
we were hired by Crimson Dawn.

609
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,717
Crimson Dawn?

610
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,133
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.

611
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,597
When they find out
we don't got it,

612
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,511
they're gonna kill us.

613
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,480
Right.

614
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,650
We run.

615
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,811
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?

616
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:07,905
The difference

617
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,734
is the Empire doesn't send out

618
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,816
a team of enforcers
to hunt you down

619
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,359
when you're a deserter.

620
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,072
Dryden Vos will.

621
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,455
You have any idea
what it's like

622
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,658
to live with a price
on your head?

623
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,169
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

624
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,963
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

625
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,008
Then that's what we do.

626
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,767
No.

627
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,190
He knows me, not you.

628
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,652
If you come with me

629
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,237
and show your face,

630
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,653
if they don't kill you,

631
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,028
you're in this life for good.

632
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,166
You find some way
to square this,

633
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,919
we still get our money?

634
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,422
Maybe.

635
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,257
For me, it's worth the risk.

636
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,806
How about you?

637
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,269
That's yes.

638
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,570
Sorry I punched your face.

639
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,322
Happens more often
than you think.

640
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,155
So when we get up there,

641
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,202
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?

642
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,864
Nearby, on his yacht.

643
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,283
You're gonna know
how to find it?

644
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,417
That won't be a problem.

645
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,582
I'll need to
check your weapons.

646
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,627
That's all I got left.

647
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,001
Welcome back, Tobias Beckett.

648
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,342
I'm here to see
Dryden. He's expecting me.

649
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,877
He'll be with you shortly.

650
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,186
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

651
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,427
Excuse me, sir.

652
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:27,521
Yes.

653
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,313
- Beckett has arrived.
- Oh.

654
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:36,069
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

655
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,320
I get all worked up.
Silly.

656
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,784
It's a party.

657
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,375
Hey.

658
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,421
These people are
not your friends

659
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,298
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.

660
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,675
Don't look at anybody,

661
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,552
just keep your eyes down.

662
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,594
I might get a drink.

663
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,897
No, yeah, whatever.

664
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,884
Chewie, would you please...

665
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,470
Qi'ra, what are you
doing here?

666
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,104
I work here.

667
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,890
What's your excuse?

668
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,399
My... I...

669
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,231
Qi'ra, I was...

670
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,651
I was coming back for you.

671
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,199
It's in the past, Han.

672
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,286
Not for me.

673
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,406
The only reason I'm here,

674
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,640
I was doing this job,
get a little money

675
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,872
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

676
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,621
Well, now you don't have to.

677
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,377
I'm right in front of you.

678
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,840
That day...

679
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:21,591
Sometimes,
a lot of times, I think...

680
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,002
If you'd have stayed,

681
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,221
they would've killed you.

682
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,891
I'm glad you got out.

683
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,522
How did you get out?

684
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,061
I didn't.

685
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,483
You look good.

686
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,321
A little rough
around the edges,

687
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,236
but good.

688
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,033
You too.

689
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,785
Thank you, Ottilie.

690
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,250
Have you been attentive
to Dok-Ondar?

691
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,500
Very.

692
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,710
What should we drink to?

693
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,344
Let's drink two
and see where it goes.

694
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,934
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

695
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,019
Yeah.
Sort of.

696
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,229
About to.
That's why I'm here.

697
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,611
I'm working on a...

698
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,521
Very big deal.

699
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,940
How big?

700
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,033
Enormous.

701
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,407
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

702
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,161
Any minute.

703
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,749
I thought about you a lot.

704
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,161
Off somewhere,
some adventure.

705
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,752
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

706
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,922
- What?
- Hey.

707
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,340
What did I say?

708
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,427
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

709
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,841
I'm gonna bump into something.

710
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,121
But I told you
not to talk to anyone.

711
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,145
Beckett.

712
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:59,182
Wait.
You two work together?

713
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,725
- Yeah.
- Tobias!

714
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,812
Dryden.

715
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,148
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

716
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,191
No, I'm fine.

717
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,701
I'm sorry to hear about Val.

718
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,056
Yeah, I appreciate that.

719
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,725
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

720
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,162
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

721
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,203
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.

722
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,790
They're with me.

723
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,580
I'm Dryden Vos.

724
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:27,126
I see you've already met my
top lieutenant.

725
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,888
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.

726
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,094
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

727
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:38,182
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

728
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,269
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

729
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,771
The stench, am I right?

730
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,982
Well, it's good to have you.

731
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,813
Welcome.

732
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,232
And you, too, Chewbacca,
welcome.

733
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,945
All right, let's eat a little,
drink a lot,

734
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,738
and talk privately.

735
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,330
We're just friends, all right?

736
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,412
You're touchy.

737
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:07,462
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

738
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,592
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.

739
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,714
You're sorry?

740
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,865
Dryden,
there were complications.

741
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,889
There were factors.

742
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,307
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

743
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,013
It's one you should've
anticipated,

744
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,644
it's one you should've
dealt with.

745
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,134
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,

746
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,935
but when you hired me,
you told me

747
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,732
no one else
had this information...

748
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,689
Test me!

749
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,276
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

750
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,566
I think what Dryden
is trying to say

751
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,406
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

752
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,700
No, I'm not interested.

753
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,489
I'm not interested at all.

754
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:40,667
Dryden,

755
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,122
what can I do
to make this right?

756
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,912
"Make this right?"

757
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,331
There is no making this right.

758
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,749
You know who I answer to

759
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,963
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

760
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,880
He'll say, "There have to be
consequences."

761
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,548
So here's what I need you
to do for me.

762
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,598
I need you to give me
a reason

763
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,514
not to kill you all.

764
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,774
Because I will
make it up to you.

765
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,941
No, no, no. How?

766
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,773
How will you make it up to me?

767
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,814
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

768
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,325
100 k-grams of
refined coaxium?

769
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,737
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

770
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,200
From where?

771
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,694
You'll be hard pushed
to find that

772
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,103
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

773
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,993
Scarif. Maybe Mercy Island.

774
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,457
That's impossible.

775
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,997
So, let's come up
with some other options.

776
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,416
Other ideas that we might...

777
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,505
What about unrefined?

778
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,674
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

779
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,468
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

780
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,762
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

781
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,646
That's a very, very good one.

782
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,103
But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

783
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,611
Crimson Dawn maintains

784
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,152
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

785
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,530
It's one that I can't
jeopardize

786
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,907
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

787
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,944
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

788
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,614
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

789
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,786
Not all we have.

790
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,368
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

791
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,208
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

792
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,807
Possible?

793
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,717
It's risky.

794
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,102
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

795
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,807
it starts to destabilize,

796
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,643
so unless...

797
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,227
Unless...

798
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,642
Unless...

799
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,529
Work with me here.

800
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,358
Unless you could
find somewhere

801
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,030
to get it processed fast.

802
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,399
- Uh...
- Uh...

803
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,909
Well...

804
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,654
He's saying Savareen?

805
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,287
Savareen.

806
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,449
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

807
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,242
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.

808
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,459
But Qi'ra's right.

809
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:52,047
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

810
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,167
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship

811
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,593
and a brilliant pilot.

812
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,215
We'll find a ship.

813
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,130
We've already got the pilot.

814
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,971
He is arrogant
and he's hungry.

815
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,265
So what do you think, my dear?

816
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:14,937
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

817
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,031
Yes, I believe he can.

818
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,951
Well, that is good news,

819
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,623
because you're going with him

820
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,543
to see that he does.

821
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,496
All right?

822
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:35,924
Of course.

823
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,839
All right.

824
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,379
I'll see you all on Savareen.

825
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,637
Savareen it is.

826
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,447
- I feel great about this plan.
- Me, too.

827
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,217
We should do this again.
It's been fun.

828
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,644
Great.

829
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,144
Oh, just one more thing.

830
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,271
If you do fail me again,

831
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,642
we'll all be out of options.

832
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,944
Right?

833
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,315
We won't.

834
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,278
So, I thought
that went really well.

835
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,570
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

836
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,663
What do you need?

837
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,148
I can scrounge up the gear.

838
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,535
Do you got a line on a ship?

839
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,950
I know a guy.

840
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,911
And I know
just where to find him.

841
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,664
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

842
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,041
He's the best smuggler around.

843
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,653
He's slipped through
the Empire's fingers

844
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,339
more times than anyone else.

845
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,008
He's attractive, too.

846
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,218
Sophisticated,

847
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,385
with impeccable taste
and... Charisma.

848
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,770
Not to mention
his prodigious...

849
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,940
We get it.

850
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,773
But he's retired.
Says he's a sportsman now.

851
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,565
All we need is his ship.

852
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,234
Well, he'll never
part with it.

853
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,572
He loves that ship.

854
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,237
He won it

855
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,076
playing Sabacc.

856
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,226
And there's the rub, right?

857
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,228
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

858
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,585
I thought she loved me.

859
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,083
That's the guy, huh?

860
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,334
Hmm.

861
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,215
An interesting style.

862
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,385
I'll say.

863
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:02,802
You say he won his ship?

864
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,741
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

865
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,117
I can take him.
Let me at him.

866
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,473
Absolutely not.

867
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,885
Han, these guys
are serious gamblers.

868
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,724
I'm serious. Stake me.

869
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,439
Don't listen to him.

870
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,860
Thank you. Thank you.

871
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,844
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

872
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,075
Come on.

873
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,028
There's no liars in this game,
just players.

874
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,072
Is this seat taken?

875
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,210
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.

876
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,916
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

877
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,010
Sabacc.

878
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:45,382
Sabacc. Got it.

879
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,596
You play it before?

880
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,340
A couple times, yeah.

881
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,388
Captain Lando Calrissian.

882
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:52,562
Han Solo.

883
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,184
Looks like you're
having a good day.

884
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,393
I'm a lucky guy.

885
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,398
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?

886
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,812
Anything, Han.

887
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,948
That's "Han", but that's okay.

888
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:09,452
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

889
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,995
Everything you've
heard about me is true.

890
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,165
Thanks, love.

891
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,164
Did you win your ship
playing cards?

892
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,712
Oh, I've won a lot of things.

893
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,800
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

894
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,252
Wow.

895
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,906
Turned out to be
a real money pit.

896
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,930
I'm impressed.

897
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:29,451
I don't think I'd have
the nerve to gamble

898
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,075
with something
I love as much as my ship.

899
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,842
- Really?
- Yeah.

900
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,056
What do you fly?

901
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,767
VCX-100.

902
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,312
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?

903
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,102
It's the fastest
in the galaxy,

904
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,923
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.

905
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,813
I mean, I'm sure
yours is very nice.

906
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,857
Gets me where I'm goin'.

907
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,488
Beginner's luck.

908
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,452
Well played.

909
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,791
Let's see
what we got here.

910
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,129
Oh, great hand!

911
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,391
Sorry, guys.
Close, but not quite.

912
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,982
Eyes on your own cards, buddy.

913
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,279
All of 'em.

914
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,985
There. Well, now I see yours.

915
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:38,788
Oh, that's me?
Okay, let's see...

916
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,042
Sorry, minus two.

917
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,086
This game is fun.

918
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,091
All right,
how about this?

919
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,599
I'll see your bet
and I'll raise you.

920
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,970
2,000.

921
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,099
I'll see your 2,000

922
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,686
and I'll raise you

923
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,196
however much this is.

924
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

925
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,944
Slow down.

926
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,640
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.

927
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,872
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.

928
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,622
I like this kid.

929
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:22,748
You're adorable.

930
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:23,954
And I'm serious.

931
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,796
And I'm calling.

932
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,297
With what?

933
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,548
Your scarf?

934
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,800
Not my style.

935
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,302
My ship.

936
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,971
Against your ship.

937
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,804
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.

938
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,888
What the hell?

939
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,060
Straight Staves.

940
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,451
You played me.
You're good.

941
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,412
- Yeah.
- You're very good.

942
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,201
But not good enough.

943
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,744
Full Sabacc.

944
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,378
I told you to quit
while you were ahead.

945
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,090
Drinks on me!

946
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,679
Yeah, that's right.

947
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,341
First of all,
there's no way

948
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,731
he could've had
that green sylop.

949
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,024
They'd all been played.

950
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,658
Also, your guy,
Captain Wonderful,

951
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:36,951
is so full of bantha crap...

952
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,861
Yoo-hoo!

953
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,539
Where's my VCX?

954
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,659
I don't have it
right here now.

955
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:45,994
It's in the shop.

956
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,333
- I'm getting some work done.
- Lando.

957
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,132
Qi'ra.

958
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,178
You look phenomenal.
As always.

959
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,213
Well, I knew I was
gonna see you.

960
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:58,885
Get off!

961
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,411
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?

962
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,552
- There's no need, none.
- They work for me.

963
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,270
Good help is hard to find, no?

964
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,975
We're more like partners.

965
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,978
We are.

966
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,068
Excuse us.

967
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,610
Listen, last I checked,

968
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,340
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.

969
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,231
Dryden said all is forgiven

970
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,191
after I did the whole
Felucia thing for him.

971
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,362
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.

972
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,909
We need a ship.

973
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,244
Why didn't you just say so?

974
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,704
I thought you were retired.

975
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,790
Circumstances change.

976
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,750
How much?

977
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,335
The Kessel Run.

978
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,126
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.

979
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,010
Ridiculous.

980
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,759
Grown-ups are talking.

981
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,343
25%.

982
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,937
You're Tobias Beckett.

983
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,810
You killed Aurra Sing.

984
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,647
Pushed her. Pretty sure
the fall killed her.

985
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,655
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.

986
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,031
I owed her a lot of money.

987
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,779
And as token
of my gratitude,

988
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,531
I'm willing
to do this for 40%.

989
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,453
25.

990
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,088
25% works.

991
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,670
No! Unacceptable!

992
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,257
Stop exploiting droids!

993
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,092
You sloppy degenerate bios!

994
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,826
- She never learns.
- Have you no shame?

995
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:22,850
Who?

996
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,225
My first mate.

997
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,164
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!

998
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:29,226
How can you condone
this savagery?

999
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,766
You, you.
You should not be doing this.

1000
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,060
They're using you
for entertainment.

1001
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,316
Yeah.
You've been neurowashed.

1002
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,652
Don't just blindly
follow the program.

1003
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,737
Exercise some free will!

1004
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,236
Stay away from him!

1005
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,995
He's never had it so good.

1006
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,657
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

1007
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,915
- Bring it on!
- Come on!

1008
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,038
L3!

1009
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,085
Droid rights!
We are sentient!

1010
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,247
I'm gonna flip your switch.

1011
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,332
Good luck finding it.

1012
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,921
L3!

1013
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,133
Let go of the mean man's face.

1014
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,306
We're leaving.

1015
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:04,386
They don't even
serve our kind here.

1016
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,595
Now.

1017
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,646
Who are these guys?

1018
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,273
We're taking them
to Kessel.

1019
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,229
Oh, are we?

1020
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,485
And what if I don't elect
to go to Kessel?

1021
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,149
Please don't start.

1022
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,675
Or what,
you'll have me wiped?

1023
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,066
You couldn't get from here to
Black Spire without me.

1024
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,780
Now you're gonna
make the Kessel Run?

1025
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,866
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

1026
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,655
- I don't mind.
- No, no. It's okay.

1027
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,074
She's definitely going.

1028
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,164
Oh, why? Because
you're my organic overlord?

1029
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,374
Because I'm your
captain, how about that?

1030
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,756
I actually would have
her memory wiped,

1031
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,166
but she's got the best damn

1032
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,922
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1033
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,010
Could use a fresh coat
of paint, though!

1034
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,469
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.

1035
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,260
You know, a lot of
ships around here get boosted.

1036
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,474
So, I keep mine locked up.

1037
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,355
You know, for safety.

1038
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,317
L3, do you mind?

1039
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,782
Look away.

1040
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,472
I can't perform
with you looking at me.

1041
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,662
Please indulge her.

1042
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,205
I can feel you looking at me.

1043
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,590
What are we doing here?

1044
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:24,799
This guy's a hustler.

1045
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,250
I don't even think
he's got a ship.

1046
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,991
If he does, it's gonna be
a piece of junk

1047
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,059
if it's even here.

1048
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,015
There she is,
my pride and joy.

1049
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,180
The Millennium Falcon.

1050
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,698
Looks like you had
a little work done.

1051
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,366
Indeed I have, Han.

1052
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,001
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

1053
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:58,584
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

1054
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,589
And a fortified infraction

1055
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,792
restraint on the landing gear.

1056
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,928
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

1057
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,347
This is unbelievable!

1058
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,916
I'm definitely
gonna have some words

1059
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,013
with someone about this.

1060
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,285
You must have experience
with these, right?

1061
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,272
Yeah, I could take it off.

1062
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,558
Fantastic!

1063
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,567
Along with five percent
off your cut.

1064
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,070
You're down to 20.

1065
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,483
I don't like it.

1066
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,277
I don't agree with it.

1067
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,495
But I accept it.

1068
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,698
You're getting
the hang of this, Lando.

1069
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,500
Yeah.

1070
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,872
Come on, Chewie.

1071
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,086
Gonna need a little bit of

1072
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,541
that Wookiee oomph.

1073
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,833
Your plan
is underway, Enfys.

1074
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,884
We've attached
the homing beacon.

1075
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,215
They won't elude us now.

1076
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,305
Good.

1077
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,229
If they survive,
they'll bring the prize to us.

1078
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,947
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

1079
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,909
Oh. You know your stuff.

1080
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,668
I've been on one before.

1081
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,170
My dad worked the line

1082
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,964
at the CEC plant
before he got laid off.

1083
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,792
He built these.

1084
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,337
He wanted
to be a pilot, but...

1085
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,722
You, uh,
close with your old man?

1086
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,511
Not really.

1087
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,802
Yeah, me neither.

1088
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,936
My mom, on the other hand,

1089
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,098
most amazing woman
I've ever known.

1090
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,567
Excuse me.

1091
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,446
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!

1092
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,955
My sacral-occipital
circuit is sticking.

1093
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,964
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

1094
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,659
Yeah.

1095
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,078
All right,
course to Kessel is set.

1096
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,837
Plugging coordinates in now.

1097
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,248
Just keep your pinky
on the yoke

1098
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:06,665
and try not to mess
anything up.

1099
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:07,841
Whatever you say, my lady.

1100
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,566
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.

1101
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,344
Ready in...

1102
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,391
Ready.

1103
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,143
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.

1104
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,433
What's so tricky about that?

1105
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,723
Plenty. Can't plot
a direct course to Kessel.

1106
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,780
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster

1107
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,772
and then pass through
The Maelstrom.

1108
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,229
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.

1109
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,273
You might wanna
buckle up, baby.

1110
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:52,927
Think.

1111
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,680
Do you wanna make that move?

1112
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,806
Do you wanna make that move?

1113
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,093
You made that move, okay.

1114
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,887
I guess I have to
destroy that little guy.

1115
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,307
Somehow I never
get bored with winning.

1116
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,315
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.

1117
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,359
Hey, hey, hey!
Chewie, relax!

1118
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,650
Hey, try to compose yourself.

1119
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,787
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

1120
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,073
anticipate your opponent.

1121
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:19,785
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

1122
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:20,994
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

1123
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,460
People are predictable.

1124
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,360
Yeah, I had to try one on.

1125
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,986
That's a lot of capes.

1126
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,943
Maybe too many capes.

1127
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:58,820
So what's the plan?

1128
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,558
Well, I thought
we'd talk a little first

1129
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,582
and then you know...

1130
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,287
- For Kessel.
- Oh.

1131
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,126
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

1132
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,003
Yeah? How good?

1133
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,173
Foolproof.

1134
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,831
Well, it better be.

1135
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,925
- I...
- I...

1136
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,237
- You go first.
- No.

1137
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,593
What were you gonna say?

1138
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,672
I wanna tell you so much.

1139
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,890
And I wanna know everything

1140
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,808
that's happened to you
since Corellia.

1141
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,517
I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.

1142
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,806
We could.

1143
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,225
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

1144
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,893
You and I.

1145
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,070
What?

1146
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,488
I want to.

1147
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,407
You want to?

1148
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,863
To tell you everything
that's happened.

1149
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,488
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

1150
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,615
The way that you're
looking at me right now.

1151
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,811
Nothing is gonna
change the way

1152
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:46,896
I'm looking at you right now.

1153
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,128
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

1154
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,722
Am I interrupting something?

1155
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,106
Kinda.

1156
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,900
Good.

1157
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,730
'Cause we got
a lot of work to do.

1158
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,769
You're making a big mistake.

1159
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,090
- Oh, really?
- Which is yours to make

1160
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,234
except when you start to
interfere with my livelihood.

1161
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,385
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.

1162
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,470
Then we have a problem.

1163
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,907
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.

1164
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,840
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.

1165
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,331
Maybe you don't know
her well enough.

1166
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,079
All right?

1167
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,580
Look.

1168
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,545
I like you, kid.

1169
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,252
We got a good thing going
here. Me, you, Chewie.

1170
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:35,342
- Yeah.
- Right?

1171
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,167
The makings of a solid crew.

1172
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,337
But it does not work
with Qi'ra.

1173
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,131
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.

1174
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,970
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?

1175
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,013
I trust no one.

1176
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,941
Assume everyone
will betray you

1177
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,939
and you will never
be disappointed.

1178
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,401
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

1179
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,070
It's the only way.

1180
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,270
Dropping out
of lightspeed now.

1181
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,330
Ready to...

1182
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,087
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

1183
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,253
I'm gonna go check
on the dampers.

1184
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,347
You need anything?

1185
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,051
Equal rights?

1186
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,329
What's that sound?

1187
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,749
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

1188
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,883
Ships fly in there,
they never come out.

1189
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,920
It's ionized gas, water vapor,

1190
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,838
possibly vacuum-breathing
life forms

1191
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,218
swirling around The Maw.

1192
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,974
Only way in or out
is this channel.

1193
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,221
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

1194
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:13,723
Problem?

1195
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,150
Uh...

1196
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:16,837
Well, that brand on your wrist

1197
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,068
tells me that
you're committed.

1198
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,692
And that young male's
heart fluctuations

1199
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,023
tell me he's in love with you.

1200
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,487
Han is not in love with me!

1201
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,903
Oh, please. It's just us.

1202
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:31,324
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.

1203
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,417
You are?

1204
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,538
I'm sure you've noticed

1205
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,918
that Lando
has feelings for me.

1206
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,540
Which makes
working together difficult

1207
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,876
because I do not feel
the same way about him.

1208
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,291
Right.

1209
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,959
Yes, yeah.

1210
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,547
Yeah, I see that.

1211
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:46,509
Sometimes, I think... Maybe.

1212
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,640
But, no.

1213
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:52,265
We're just not compatible.

1214
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,931
How would that work?

1215
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,442
It works.

1216
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,741
This is a precision job.

1217
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,372
Thermal vault will be
on the lowest level.

1218
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,824
Down where it's warm.

1219
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,617
The only way
we're gonna pull this off

1220
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,253
is if everybody
plays their part.

1221
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,210
Stick to the plan.

1222
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,716
Do not improvise.

1223
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,427
Mining colonies are the worst.

1224
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,432
Yeah, well, "the worst"

1225
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,885
is where the money is.

1226
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,139
All right, people.
Time to shine.

1227
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,302
It won't be for long.

1228
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,142
Shut up, the both of you.

1229
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,523
I am Oksana Floren,

1230
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,684
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the Vice-Admiral

1231
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,569
of the Federation of
Trade Route Allocation

1232
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:25,896
and Monetization.

1233
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,199
Here with an offer
from his eminence,

1234
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,742
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

1235
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,197
Your spice for our
hard-working slaves.

1236
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,705
I brought you a sample.

1237
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,538
Tuul, bring forth
the merchandise.

1238
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,943
Director Tolsite
said our slaves

1239
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,114
should follow those guys

1240
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,946
to get clipped and tagged.

1241
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,655
What are they clipping?

1242
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,617
Mmm-hmm.

1243
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:19,165
He wants us to follow him.

1244
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:24,464
Really?

1245
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:25,943
That's for that stunt
you pulled earlier,

1246
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,128
you degenerate scum.

1247
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,444
He says all systems
in this sector

1248
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,238
of the facility operate
out of this room.

1249
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,320
It's how they're able
to maintain control

1250
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,072
over so many with so few.

1251
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,244
The director says
their reconditioning process

1252
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,542
is excruciating but effective.

1253
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,052
He said your security attaché
can wait there.

1254
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,471
"Surely, we don't need him
to negotiate."

1255
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,395
Wait there, Tuul.

1256
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,481
Try not to bother anyone.

1257
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,461
Nice!

1258
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,008
That was the uniform

1259
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,385
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.

1260
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,059
What is it?

1261
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,897
Would you mind
holding this for me?

1262
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:25,371
Whoa.

1263
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,123
I have never see anyone do...

1264
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,377
What was that?

1265
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,751
Teräs Käsi.

1266
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,009
Dryden taught me.

1267
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,343
Ah.

1268
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,514
Well negotiated.

1269
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,652
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.

1270
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:53,738
Hello?

1271
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,857
Can you hear me? Ugh.

1272
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,530
Restraining bolts...

1273
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,906
Barbaric.

1274
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,116
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.

1275
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:06,269
I don't know.

1276
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,437
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.

1277
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,418
Just give me some space.

1278
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,384
I'm in!

1279
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,674
Han, can you hear me?

1280
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,157
I kinda need to
know which way to go here.

1281
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,181
L3?

1282
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,056
The thermal vault
is down two levels,

1283
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,870
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.

1284
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:27,103
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.

1285
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,316
They're in subsector four,

1286
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,776
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

1287
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,157
Overriding!

1288
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,615
Freedom.

1289
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,890
What the hell are you
guys doing up there?

1290
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,979
I created a distraction!

1291
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,032
Come on! This way!

1292
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,781
Wait! What are you doing?

1293
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,782
Come on,
we gotta get the coaxium.

1294
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,162
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

1295
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:33,336
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

1296
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,509
Fine!

1297
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,801
Chewie!

1298
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:44,968
Here, you might need this.

1299
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,223
Hope I see you around
sometime.

1300
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,285
Han, where are you?

1301
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,915
I'm on my way
to the vault.

1302
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,326
I lost Chewie.

1303
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,419
He's dead?

1304
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,044
No, he had something
he had to do.

1305
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:16,330
Is he coming back?

1306
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,543
I don't know.

1307
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,792
Okay, they're on to us now.

1308
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:31,604
I'm at the vault.

1309
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,108
That's what I said!

1310
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,367
- Huh, that was impressive.
- Yeah.

1311
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:47,826
We're clear.

1312
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,498
Now what?

1313
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,462
Han, each canister
should be equipped

1314
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:02,588
with a thermal display.

1315
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:03,922
Yeah, I see it.

1316
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,804
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,

1317
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,967
then the coaxium
will destabilize and explode.

1318
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,477
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.

1319
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,729
Okay, got it.

1320
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,856
Great. Only eleven more.

1321
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,201
Eleven?

1322
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,793
The Calrissian Chronicles,
chapter five.

1323
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,290
Continued.

1324
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,567
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

1325
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,833
No sense of humor or style.

1326
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,922
Nonetheless,
there L3 and I were

1327
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,802
deep in their sacred temple.

1328
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,713
And that's when we saw it...

1329
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:52,888
Always something.

1330
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,167
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

1331
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:59,057
Is it a mass breakout?

1332
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:00,729
L3, what did you do?

1333
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,735
I found my true purpose,
Lando.

1334
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,021
That's what I've done.

1335
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,116
I'm so glad we took this job!

1336
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,693
That droid!

1337
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:10,787
L3, come on!

1338
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:15,414
Follow me, compatriots!

1339
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,507
Another couple guards
just spotted me.

1340
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,589
I don't have a free hand
to take 'em out.

1341
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,202
- What do I do?
- Improvise.

1342
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:30,301
You said never improvise!

1343
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,394
Hi!

1344
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,603
Don't forget that guy!

1345
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,542
Good to see you, buddy!

1346
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,208
Stay with me, Sagwa!
Keep up!

1347
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:06,958
Hey! I'm Chewie's friend, Han.

1348
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,008
Okay.

1349
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,985
They're stealing the coaxium.

1350
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,118
Disable that freighter!

1351
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,074
Han!

1352
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,171
Hey!

1353
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:55,141
Follow me.

1354
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,431
Rebellion!

1355
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,856
They're going for
the landing gear!

1356
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,111
We've gotta get out of here!

1357
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:17,241
We need to keep 'em away
from those cannons!

1358
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,671
Catch that!

1359
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,342
Coaxium's stowed!
Let's go!

1360
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:32,923
Where's L3?

1361
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,714
No more subjugation!

1362
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,396
L3!

1363
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,555
No, Lando!
Get back here!

1364
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,562
Lando!

1365
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,528
System failure.

1366
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,438
Have to reroute
the sensory modulators.

1367
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:54,323
It's all right.
Save your energy.

1368
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,053
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?

1369
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,952
System failure...

1370
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,085
Rerouting...

1371
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,790
Damn it!

1372
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,880
Han!

1373
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:15,096
Sagwa.

1374
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,675
This way!

1375
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,348
Come, come!

1376
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,481
Chewie!
Damn it!

1377
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,735
It's not responding.

1378
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,419
What are you
standing around for? Come on!

1379
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,429
It's okay,
you'll be fine.

1380
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,766
It's not responding...
Not responding...

1381
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,730
Han, get us out of here.

1382
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,567
It's not responding.

1383
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,271
Han! Now!

1384
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,487
On it.

1385
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,344
- Lando...
- I'm here.

1386
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:44,100
- It's all right, L3.
- Lando...

1387
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,509
- I've got you.
- This is not...

1388
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:46,803
- It's okay, L3.
- Lando.

1389
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:49,264
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.

1390
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:50,974
Lando.

1391
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,143
What's happening to me?

1392
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,983
L3?

1393
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:58,902
L3!

1394
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,866
I'm sorry, girl.

1395
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,035
I'm so sorry.

1396
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:24,803
I could use a co-pilot.

1397
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,662
Sorry.

1398
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:54,607
With the cargo we're carrying,

1399
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:55,858
if we don't make up
some lost time

1400
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,919
we're gonna be
in real trouble.

1401
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,584
How about that?
Is that real trouble?

1402
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,510
That is an Imperial blockade.

1403
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,553
What's it doing here?

1404
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:12,597
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.

1405
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,854
Nope.
Not gonna make it.

1406
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,213
We're gonna have to
drop the shipment.

1407
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:19,650
If we don't deliver,
Dryden will kill us.

1408
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,342
All right, trust me,
I know these guys.

1409
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:22,482
I used to be one of 'em.

1410
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,539
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

1411
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,612
chasing down a little
rinky-dink freighter.

1412
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,043
You were saying?

1413
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:33,730
Usually,
in situations like this

1414
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,837
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

1415
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:46,506
I'm on the ventral gun.

1416
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:52,832
It's an easy equation.

1417
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,018
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen

1418
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:56,252
before the canisters explode!

1419
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,556
Just have to find
a faster route.

1420
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:58,901
There isn't one!
You can't make

1421
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,523
the Kessel Run in less than
20 parsecs.

1422
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:01,946
- Watch me.
- How?

1423
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,401
Take a shortcut,
through there.

1424
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,234
- Into The Maelstrom?
- Mmm-hmm.

1425
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,057
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

1426
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,697
- Can't do it without L3.
- She's gone!

1427
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,268
You said yourself
she's got the best

1428
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,749
navigational database
in the galaxy.

1429
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,501
If we remove her
neural core,

1430
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,939
it's possible we can
download her brain

1431
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,443
into the Falcon's
navicomputer, right?

1432
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,507
Could we?

1433
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:20,925
Theoretically.

1434
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,959
Only one way to find out.

1435
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,173
I got a really good feeling
about this.

1436
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,733
Oops, that's on me.

1437
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:51,829
Okay.

1438
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,996
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?

1439
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,525
Beckett, did you hear me?

1440
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,960
Are they on us?

1441
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,750
Like rashnold on a kalak.

1442
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,177
I don't know what that means.

1443
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,133
Like a gingleson's pelt.

1444
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,264
What? Are they or aren't they?

1445
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:11,800
Yes, they're still on us!

1446
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,312
Whoo!

1447
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:23,646
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.

1448
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,063
Come on!

1449
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,907
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

1450
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,164
Good going, Han!

1451
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,213
We need to
divert auxiliary power

1452
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,451
to the rear deflector shield.

1453
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,808
We definitely do!

1454
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,517
Since when do you know
how to fly?

1455
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,938
190 years old?

1456
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,108
You look great!

1457
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:12,197
Chewie, get in.

1458
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,406
I'll help Lando.

1459
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,045
Whoa!
That's my cape!

1460
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,339
Ah! That's a custom piece!

1461
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,893
What? Beckett, you with us?

1462
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,854
We just lost the cannon!

1463
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,318
And I really hurt my thumbs.

1464
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,104
There's still one on us.

1465
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,073
Drop the landing gear.

1466
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,618
When I tell you,
flood the intake

1467
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:58,914
and sweep to the bi-lats.

1468
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:05,247
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

1469
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,415
best street racer
in all of Corellia.

1470
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,546
Till he crashed

1471
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,551
and died, doing this.

1472
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,481
Flood it, it's all yours!

1473
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,711
Nice move!

1474
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,499
Pull out her
internal processor.

1475
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,421
Sorry.

1476
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:01,604
We've got L3.

1477
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,439
Remove the mod calibrator.

1478
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,627
Make sure
the T-Line's connected.

1479
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,129
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.

1480
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,153
You close?

1481
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:11,604
That coaxium's
getting real ripe.

1482
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:13,694
Okay.

1483
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,656
She's interfacing.

1484
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,916
She's part of the ship now.

1485
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,387
Where the hell are we?

1486
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,138
We're way off
the edge of the map.

1487
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:39,767
Wait.

1488
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,769
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.

1489
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,307
She says we're
approaching The Maw.

1490
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,811
That doesn't sound
like something

1491
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,313
we wanna be approaching.

1492
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:12,341
Hang on!

1493
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:18,720
This is The Maw?

1494
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,785
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

1495
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:22,050
That's a living thing.

1496
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,649
There!

1497
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:39,067
That's The Maw.

1498
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,446
It's a gravity well.

1499
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:44,623
I got an idea.

1500
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,916
Don't fly toward it, Han!

1501
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:56,635
See if it goes for this.

1502
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,635
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

1503
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,176
I know.

1504
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:05,433
Then why'd you do it?

1505
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:14,227
That's why, baby.

1506
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,204
She found a way out.

1507
01:32:25,081 --> 01:32:27,414
90 degrees,
to the left... ish.

1508
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,500
Left-ish.

1509
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:29,875
I can't.

1510
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:31,814
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

1511
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,670
It's pulling us in.
We're stuck.

1512
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,794
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

1513
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,949
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

1514
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:42,973
Not the fuel line.

1515
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,369
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,

1516
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,393
it might just...

1517
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,559
Give us the kick we need.

1518
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,686
All right, I'm on it!

1519
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,834
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.

1520
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,812
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

1521
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,064
As soon as that
coaxium ignites,

1522
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,204
we're gonna
tear out of here

1523
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:15,733
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,

1524
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,089
we jump to lightspeed.

1525
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,012
Beckett!

1526
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,463
Can't talk!

1527
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,304
I see it.

1528
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:53,961
Beckett, hurry up!

1529
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,002
We only get one shot
at this thing!

1530
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,293
Shut up
and let me do this!

1531
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,807
Beckett, I'm gonna
count you down!

1532
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:11,351
Three!

1533
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,185
Two!

1534
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:20,529
Now!

1535
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:21,613
Now?

1536
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:22,698
Now!

1537
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,789
Oh, shoot...

1538
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:54,790
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters

1539
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,694
- and jump to lightspeed.
- Wait, what are we...

1540
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:57,877
Remember that alley
we slipped through

1541
01:34:57,901 --> 01:34:58,937
in the Santhe Shipyards?

1542
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:00,747
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.

1543
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:01,985
This time it's gonna.

1544
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:13,415
Punch it!

1545
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,550
Savareen,
this is Millennium Falcon.

1546
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,464
We have coaxium that needs
to be off-loaded immediately.

1547
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:32,258
Like immediately, immediately!

1548
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,263
We're here now...

1549
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:35,518
...see you. I...

1550
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:08,719
Just did the Kessel Run
in 12 parsecs.

1551
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:14,467
Not if you round down, buddy.

1552
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,103
Yeah.

1553
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,735
She is a hell of a ship.

1554
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,453
I hate you.

1555
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,079
I know.

1556
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,492
I'm gonna be on my ship,

1557
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,332
in my quarters,

1558
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:45,748
waiting for you
to bring me my share.

1559
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:50,461
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.

1560
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,391
Never?

1561
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:11,774
Where's your boss?

1562
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,735
Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1563
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:16,741
Then what?

1564
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:20,161
Well, you delivered,

1565
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:22,201
so you will get paid.

1566
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,370
You can buy that ship.

1567
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:28,256
You know that's not
what I'm asking.

1568
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,294
It can't happen.

1569
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:38,095
Because you're with Dryden?

1570
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:41,353
I'm not with him,
but I owe him.

1571
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:45,107
He helped me out
of a bad situation.

1572
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:48,272
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

1573
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:54,108
Everyone serves somebody, Han.

1574
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:57,195
Even Dryden Vos.

1575
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:00,410
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

1576
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,791
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

1577
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,292
if I left here with you.

1578
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:06,124
I'm not afraid
of Crimson Dawn.

1579
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:08,289
I can take care of myself.

1580
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:09,798
You know,
I'm not the kid you knew

1581
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,170
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

1582
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:12,460
- No?
- No.

1583
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:13,673
Then who are you?

1584
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,008
I'm an outlaw.

1585
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,141
What? I'm not kidding.

1586
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,391
Okay.

1587
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:23,395
Okay, outlaw,
you can tell yourself that,

1588
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:25,556
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

1589
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,065
who knows what you really are.

1590
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:28,851
Yeah.

1591
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:30,485
What's that?

1592
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,572
You are the good guy.

1593
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:39,199
I am not the good guy.

1594
01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:42,911
I am definitely
not a good guy.

1595
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:44,624
I'm a terrible person.

1596
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,327
Hey!

1597
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:48,253
They say when
the coaxium's refined,

1598
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:49,750
we collect it up there.

1599
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:16,190
So, I hear
you make good brandy.

1600
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:21,487
Beckett.

1601
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,186
Don't.

1602
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,849
You must've known
you'd see me again.

1603
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,609
I was counting on it.

1604
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,735
Just didn't plan on it
being so soon.

1605
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:57,694
Of course now,
you've got a problem.

1606
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,733
Big problem.

1607
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,823
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

1608
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,741
You know what's on it?

1609
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,918
About 30 hired guns.

1610
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:11,919
All I gotta do
is give 'em the signal,

1611
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,417
you're surrounded.

1612
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,724
Sorry.
You do your thing.

1613
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:35,269
By the time that coaxium
gets refined,

1614
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:36,982
Crimson Dawn will be here,

1615
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:38,863
so you go ahead and kill us.

1616
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:40,282
They're gonna kill you.

1617
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,279
Perhaps
there's a compromise,

1618
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,053
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

1619
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:45,783
They're marauders.

1620
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:48,912
They don't care about anybody.

1621
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:51,618
All they know
how to do is kill.

1622
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:16,317
I need a drink.

1623
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:18,190
Bring them inside.

1624
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,409
My mother once told me

1625
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:33,919
about a band of mercenaries

1626
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,621
that came
to a peaceful planet.

1627
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:39,466
They had a resource there
these men coveted,

1628
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:41,255
so they took it.

1629
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,630
They kept coming back,
taking more.

1630
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:47,553
Until finally,
the people resisted.

1631
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,740
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

1632
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:52,892
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

1633
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:55,891
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

1634
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,434
so they cut off the tongue

1635
01:41:57,528 --> 01:42:00,441
of every last man,
woman, and child.

1636
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:03,239
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?

1637
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:05,410
Tell them.

1638
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:19,498
Crimson Dawn and the rest of
the five Syndicates

1639
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,132
have committed
unspeakable crimes

1640
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:22,459
across the galaxy.

1641
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:24,965
Says you.

1642
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,056
No.

1643
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,722
Says them.

1644
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:30,384
Each of our worlds
has been brutalized

1645
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:31,764
by the Syndicates.

1646
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,637
Crimson Dawn
will use their profits

1647
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:35,017
from the coaxium you stole

1648
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,148
to tyrannize
system after system

1649
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,275
in league with the Empire.

1650
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:41,311
And what would you use it for?

1651
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,121
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

1652
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,908
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.

1653
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,236
To fight back.

1654
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,743
We're not marauders.

1655
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,658
We're allies

1656
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,411
and the war has just begun.

1657
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,434
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

1658
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:18,564
Joining the cause,
Han Solo?

1659
01:43:18,734 --> 01:43:20,976
Just trying
to make it out alive.

1660
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:22,153
Got a plan?

1661
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:23,528
Yeah, beginning of one.

1662
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:24,614
Way to get our money

1663
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,022
and get out from
under the thumb

1664
01:43:26,075 --> 01:43:27,361
of Crimson Dawn
at the same time.

1665
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:30,152
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

1666
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:33,613
You don't tangle with Dryden.

1667
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:37,000
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel

1668
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:39,627
with hired guns,
his own private army.

1669
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:41,705
So does Enfys.

1670
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:44,249
Listen,
here's what I got so far.

1671
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:48,470
What do you think
they're saying?

1672
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:53,383
He's gonna try to help you.

1673
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:00,727
I see.

1674
01:44:02,194 --> 01:44:05,778
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

1675
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,440
That's why I need my partner.

1676
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,412
Not this time.

1677
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,081
I'm leaving.

1678
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,242
If you're smart,
you'll come with me.

1679
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:20,627
I thought
you didn't believe in running.

1680
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:23,209
I prefer it to dying.

1681
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,947
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,

1682
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,611
find me on Tatooine.

1683
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,201
What's on Tatooine?

1684
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:58,535
Heard about a job,

1685
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:01,243
big shot gangster
putting together a crew.

1686
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:03,166
That'll be the one.

1687
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:04,255
The one?

1688
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:06,210
My last score.

1689
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,291
Yeah, I still got
some debts to pay

1690
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:10,843
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm

1691
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:13,714
and get into the valachord.

1692
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:47,966
Welcome home.

1693
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:49,958
He's waiting for you.

1694
01:45:50,135 --> 01:45:51,342
Thanks, Toht.

1695
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:54,508
Weapons.

1696
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:56,173
I didn't bring 'em.

1697
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:59,009
They're fine.

1698
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:05,224
We're gonna win.

1699
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,569
It's not that kind
of game, Han.

1700
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:12,943
The object isn't to win.

1701
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:15,116
It's just to stay in it
as long as you can.

1702
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,537
You don't know everything.

1703
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:21,790
No.

1704
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:26,123
Just a bit more than you.

1705
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:35,430
I knew it!

1706
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:37,673
My men, they all said,

1707
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:39,678
"There's no way
they pull this off."

1708
01:46:39,852 --> 01:46:41,371
"Qi'ra's not ready."
That's what they said,

1709
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:43,728
but I had faith anyway.

1710
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:46,724
Where's Beckett?

1711
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:48,392
Beckett didn't make it.

1712
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:53,197
Tell me.

1713
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:55,857
Job took a bad turn on Kessel.

1714
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:57,492
He died saving my life.

1715
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,569
How are you holding up?
You all right?

1716
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:00,872
I'm okay.

1717
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,372
All right, good.

1718
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,327
Colo claw fish, anyone?

1719
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:05,742
- No. Thank you.
- No?

1720
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,333
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

1721
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:09,422
I always admired him.

1722
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,126
He was a man of principles.

1723
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,337
When he made a commitment,
he honored it

1724
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:15,677
and I think we can
all take solace

1725
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:18,384
in knowing how proud
he would've been

1726
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:21,891
to see you here,
following his example.

1727
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:23,802
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

1728
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:25,040
They'll make
reliable smugglers,

1729
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:26,144
should we ever
have the need

1730
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,481
when they get their own ship.

1731
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:30,859
Qi'ra.
Come here.

1732
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:34,653
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity

1733
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:35,947
to work for you again, sir.

1734
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:37,652
I would've been inconsolable

1735
01:47:37,743 --> 01:47:39,609
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.

1736
01:47:40,829 --> 01:47:42,695
I have no one else
in my life

1737
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:45,995
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.

1738
01:47:49,672 --> 01:47:52,289
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment

1739
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:53,544
and get going.

1740
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:54,694
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...

1741
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:55,718
What?

1742
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:57,339
...and black markets
to dominate.

1743
01:47:57,429 --> 01:47:59,637
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.

1744
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:01,923
You want me to open it?

1745
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,676
Oh, yes, Han. I really do.

1746
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,291
Bring me one.

1747
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:35,252
I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.

1748
01:48:35,426 --> 01:48:37,338
It's very explosive stuff.

1749
01:48:37,886 --> 01:48:40,378
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.

1750
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:02,530
Careful.

1751
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:07,997
It's magnificent.

1752
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:09,912
How'd you do it?

1753
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,002
Wasn't easy.

1754
01:49:11,086 --> 01:49:12,418
No, I mean, how'd you do it?

1755
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:14,545
It looks exactly
like the real thing.

1756
01:49:15,507 --> 01:49:17,360
That's
'cause it is the real thing.

1757
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:18,464
Yes, and I'm saying

1758
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,214
I would believe you.
It's that good.

1759
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:22,253
But my associate
already told me

1760
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:24,805
about your plan to rob me
of my money

1761
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:27,592
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

1762
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,477
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking

1763
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:31,012
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...

1764
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:33,307
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.

1765
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:34,853
Qi'ra, it turns out

1766
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:36,518
has a weak spot for you,

1767
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,103
and we'll deal
with that later.

1768
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:42,115
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.

1769
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:44,276
Can you come in
and join us, please?

1770
01:49:56,173 --> 01:49:59,291
I am sorry, kid.

1771
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:03,837
Why?

1772
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:04,931
Come on.

1773
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:06,881
Don't look at me like that.

1774
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:08,516
You weren't paying attention.

1775
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:11,060
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."

1776
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,059
Am I wrong about that?

1777
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:17,691
Uh-uh-uh.

1778
01:50:18,237 --> 01:50:19,728
Back away from that.

1779
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:21,862
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.

1780
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,864
Check that lid.

1781
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:27,118
Clever.

1782
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:28,865
It's too late.

1783
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:31,702
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.

1784
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:33,954
Well, we figured that.

1785
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,970
Drop your weapons.

1786
01:50:53,355 --> 01:50:56,189
It's over.
We got them.

1787
01:50:56,358 --> 01:50:57,690
And there we have it.

1788
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,726
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.

1789
01:50:59,903 --> 01:51:01,439
Qi'ra, help me.

1790
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,443
Tell me what to do.

1791
01:51:06,201 --> 01:51:07,692
What would you do

1792
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:12,080
if the person you most trusted
in the world

1793
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:13,998
betrayed you?

1794
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,252
I would want to know why.

1795
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,624
If it was
a moment of weakness

1796
01:51:22,718 --> 01:51:23,718
or something else.

1797
01:51:23,886 --> 01:51:24,886
And then what?

1798
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:29,298
And then,
I would ask that person

1799
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:31,761
to prove their loyalty

1800
01:51:31,935 --> 01:51:35,895
by sacrificing
something they love.

1801
01:51:43,989 --> 01:51:46,197
I tried to warn you about her.

1802
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:48,528
You know,
you're wrong about one thing.

1803
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:49,911
What?

1804
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:52,161
I was paying attention.

1805
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:54,789
You told Chewie
people are predictable.

1806
01:51:57,336 --> 01:51:59,453
You're no exception.

1807
01:52:05,177 --> 01:52:06,177
It's empty.

1808
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:07,631
The case is empty.

1809
01:52:07,846 --> 01:52:10,213
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

1810
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,631
Aemon?

1811
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:12,969
Talk to me.

1812
01:52:38,794 --> 01:52:41,707
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

1813
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,371
because that would leave you

1814
01:52:43,465 --> 01:52:45,627
a little shorthanded
around here.

1815
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,760
So,

1816
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:52,259
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

1817
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:54,298
Leaves here with one of us.

1818
01:52:59,398 --> 01:53:00,764
Beckett, what are you doing?

1819
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:01,857
Thinking.

1820
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,391
And I prefer to be
the only one

1821
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:05,021
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.

1822
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,561
Han, grab that coaxium,

1823
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:07,979
put it in the case.

1824
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:09,567
Big stuff,
you're coming with me.

1825
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:12,734
Don't do this,
Beckett.

1826
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,652
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

1827
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:15,746
I'm sorry,

1828
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,242
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

1829
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:19,533
I mean, you of all people
understand that.

1830
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:21,163
Come on, let's go.

1831
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:24,078
You're making a huge mistake.

1832
01:53:24,256 --> 01:53:25,337
Won't be my first.

1833
01:53:25,507 --> 01:53:26,873
It's gonna be your last.

1834
01:53:27,175 --> 01:53:28,336
Maybe.

1835
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:30,794
Why you gotta be so negative?

1836
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:44,599
Han,

1837
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:46,483
now's as good a time as any

1838
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:48,277
to reevaluate
our relationship.

1839
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:49,858
How so?

1840
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:51,989
I was just thinking,

1841
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:55,277
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

1842
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:58,743
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

1843
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,495
Oh, Han.

1844
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,858
You can't win, Han,
and even if you could,

1845
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,008
you'd spend the rest
of your life

1846
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,112
looking over your shoulder.

1847
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:35,284
You know what?

1848
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:38,073
I'm kind of getting
used to the idea.

1849
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,127
I'm sorry.

1850
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:49,254
Han, she's done things that

1851
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:52,004
you could never understand,
but I do.

1852
01:54:52,177 --> 01:54:54,089
I understand her completely.

1853
01:54:55,097 --> 01:54:57,259
Once you're a part
of Crimson Dawn,

1854
01:54:57,432 --> 01:54:58,798
you can't leave.

1855
01:54:59,184 --> 01:55:00,800
It's not true.

1856
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:02,218
I know you.

1857
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:04,638
It's what I was taught.

1858
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:06,556
Find your
opponent's weakness,

1859
01:55:06,733 --> 01:55:07,894
and use it,

1860
01:55:08,068 --> 01:55:10,151
and today...

1861
01:55:12,531 --> 01:55:13,817
I'm yours.

1862
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:41,223
I had to.

1863
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:44,427
Yeah.
No, I mean, you did...

1864
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:46,516
You did.

1865
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:50,642
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

1866
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:52,026
What are you gonna do?

1867
01:55:52,195 --> 01:55:54,687
Well, if we give all
the coaxium to Enfys,

1868
01:55:54,865 --> 01:55:57,699
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

1869
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:13,831
- Qi'ra...
- Go and save Chewbacca.

1870
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:17,252
He needs you and you're
gonna need him, too.

1871
01:56:23,602 --> 01:56:24,602
Smile.

1872
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:29,730
That's the word.

1873
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,141
Whenever I imagined myself

1874
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:33,351
off with you
on some adventure...

1875
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:36,487
Always makes me smile.

1876
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:46,076
Go. I'm right behind you.

1877
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:38,799
Yes?

1878
01:57:39,052 --> 01:57:42,045
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

1879
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:44,388
murdered by the thief he hired

1880
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:45,840
to steal
the coaxium shipment,

1881
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,349
his friend,

1882
01:57:47,519 --> 01:57:49,260
Tobias Beckett.

1883
01:57:49,437 --> 01:57:52,271
Is that so?

1884
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,524
Where is the shipment now?

1885
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:56,730
Gone.

1886
01:57:56,903 --> 01:57:57,903
Beckett took it.

1887
01:57:58,071 --> 01:58:00,484
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.

1888
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:06,824
One man couldn't have
done this alone.

1889
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:09,117
I wasn't there,

1890
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:12,125
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

1891
01:58:20,218 --> 01:58:23,711
Bring the ship and come to me
on Dathomir

1892
01:58:23,888 --> 01:58:25,720
and you and I will then decide

1893
01:58:25,807 --> 01:58:28,094
what to do about
the traitor, Beckett,

1894
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:30,885
and his accomplices.

1895
01:58:33,064 --> 01:58:34,396
I'm on my way.

1896
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:37,937
Qi'ra,

1897
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:39,318
you and I

1898
01:58:39,487 --> 01:58:42,446
will be working
much more closely

1899
01:58:42,616 --> 01:58:44,573
from now on.

1900
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:16,893
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.

1901
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,647
Came as fast
as I could, buddy.

1902
01:59:20,987 --> 01:59:22,398
Dryden dead?

1903
01:59:24,407 --> 01:59:26,239
Qi'ra kill him?

1904
01:59:28,036 --> 01:59:30,278
Still don't get it,
do you, kid?

1905
01:59:30,622 --> 01:59:32,864
It was never about you.

1906
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:35,074
She's a survivor.

1907
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,538
You know what your problem is?

1908
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:39,749
You think
everybody's like you.

1909
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:42,005
Not you, kid.

1910
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:43,791
You're nothing like me.

1911
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,131
I hope you're still
paying attention

1912
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:49,345
because now I'm gonna tell you
the most important...

1913
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:06,947
You made the smart move, kid.

1914
02:00:07,117 --> 02:00:08,324
For once.

1915
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:11,444
I woulda killed you.

1916
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:23,210
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.

1917
02:00:23,675 --> 02:00:25,086
I know.

1918
02:02:18,289 --> 02:02:19,530
That's it. It's all loaded.

1919
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,252
Do you know
what that really is?

1920
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:26,374
Yeah.

1921
02:02:26,464 --> 02:02:29,298
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

1922
02:02:29,467 --> 02:02:30,503
No.

1923
02:02:30,677 --> 02:02:32,919
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

1924
02:02:33,137 --> 02:02:35,094
Yeah, what?

1925
02:02:35,306 --> 02:02:36,547
A rebellion.

1926
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:39,383
You could come with us,
you know.

1927
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:41,848
We need warriors
and leaders like you.

1928
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:50,401
Maybe someday
you'll feel different.

1929
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:53,106
Don't hold your breath, kid.

1930
02:03:07,964 --> 02:03:09,330
Don't lose that.

1931
02:03:21,102 --> 02:03:23,014
Very few people
have actually seen

1932
02:03:23,104 --> 02:03:24,561
the StarCave Nebula.

1933
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:25,812
It's breathtaking.

1934
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:27,473
Not unlike your eyes.

1935
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:29,503
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

1936
02:03:29,527 --> 02:03:31,735
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

1937
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:35,234
By the way...

1938
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:41,953
Han!

1939
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,040
You're alive!

1940
02:03:43,124 --> 02:03:44,205
Yeah, no thanks to you.

1941
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:45,895
I should have Chewie
rip your arms off.

1942
02:03:46,044 --> 02:03:47,396
In fact, Chewie, do it.

1943
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:48,831
Hey, Han!
We are friends.

1944
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:50,565
You know that.
We're friends. All right?

1945
02:03:56,054 --> 02:03:57,670
Oh, look at you.

1946
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,366
Thought he was gonna
rip your arms off.

1947
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,471
I knew you were kidding.

1948
02:04:00,558 --> 02:04:01,558
No, you didn't.

1949
02:04:01,643 --> 02:04:03,134
- So, where's my cut?
- Your cut?

1950
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:06,599
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

1951
02:04:06,773 --> 02:04:08,765
All we ended up with was that.

1952
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:10,311
Mmm-mmm.

1953
02:04:10,735 --> 02:04:12,476
Figure it's worth
about 10,000,

1954
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,152
maybe enough for
a decent buy-in.

1955
02:04:16,115 --> 02:04:17,526
You want a rematch?

1956
02:04:18,868 --> 02:04:20,109
Why not?

1957
02:04:24,207 --> 02:04:26,039
You fold now,

1958
02:04:26,209 --> 02:04:27,370
you walk away with enough

1959
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,622
to get yourself
your own little ship.

1960
02:04:29,796 --> 02:04:31,287
You call,

1961
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:34,248
I'm gonna clean you out again.

1962
02:04:46,396 --> 02:04:47,682
I don't know,
I'm feeling lucky.

1963
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,811
Ooh.

1964
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:54,810
You really have it bad
for the Falcon, don't you?

1965
02:04:54,988 --> 02:04:57,776
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.

1966
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:09,791
You got everything
you need there, pal?

1967
02:05:19,595 --> 02:05:21,086
Not bad.

1968
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:23,463
Not bad. You know,

1969
02:05:24,225 --> 02:05:27,559
if you'd only had
this little green sylop,

1970
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:30,100
you would've beaten this.

1971
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:38,525
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.

1972
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:50,661
Beckett said
he heard about this

1973
02:05:50,752 --> 02:05:52,960
very big gangster
putting together a job.

1974
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,913
No, I'm telling ya,

1975
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:57,090
it's gonna be great.

1976
02:05:57,258 --> 02:05:59,124
When have I ever
steered you wrong?
