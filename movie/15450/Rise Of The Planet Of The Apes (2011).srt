1
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,850
好了  给你
Okay, okay. Here you go.

2
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,100
我们再来一遍
And let's go again.

3
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,690
这只是几号  九号吗
Which one is this? Number nine?

4
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,230
是的  是九号
Yeah, this is number nine.

5
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,490
我们叫她明眸
Bright Eyes, we call her.

6
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,280
你看到了吗
Are you watching this?

7
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,280
太不可思议了
This is unbelievable.

8
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,130
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

9
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,170
她用了几步  二十步
How many moves was that? 20.

10
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,430
满分是十五步
Yeah, a perfect score is 15.

11
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,840
博士  你给她用了什么药
Doc, what are you giving her?

12
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,260
把那录像给我
Hey, give me that video!

13
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,600
九号猩猩  就用了一剂药
Chimp number nine, just one dose.

14
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,940
不是应该过会儿见你吗
Aren't I seeing you later?

15
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,230
我们万事俱备了
We are good to go.

16
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,650
一会儿打给你  好的  再见
I'm going to call you back. Yeah, all right. Thanks. Bye.

17
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,030
112号药奏效了
The 112. It works.

18
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,990
只在一只猩猩上用过
On just the one primate.

19
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,340
一只足够了
One is all we need.

20
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,150
这药能全面恢复认知力
Full cognitive recovery.

21
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,120
我们准备好了
We're ready.

22
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,040
你确定没有操之过急吗
Look, are you sure you're not rushing this?

23
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,870
我进行此项研究已经有五年半了
I've been working on this for five and a half years.

24
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,290
研究数据无懈可击
The data is clear.

25
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,750
斯蒂芬  我们准备好了
We're ready, Steven.

26
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,920
只等你批准进行人体试验了
All I need is your approval for human trials.

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,670
人体试验需要董事会的批准
For this, you're going to need the board's approval.

28
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,630
威尔  这研究可是花了大血本的
There's a lot of money riding on this, Will.

29
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,970
你只有一次机会
You only get one shot.

30
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,970
一次机会足矣
One shot is all I need.

31
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,600
好的  但是我要看
All right. But I'll need to see

32
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,560
所有的研究报告  没问题
all the research. You got it.

33
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,100
威尔  什么事
And, Will... Yeah?

34
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,980
别太感情用事
Keep your personal emotions out of it.

35
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,820
那帮投资人看重的是成果  不是你的梦想
These people invest in results, not dreams.

36
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,030
好的
Okay.

37
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,950
来见见九号猩猩
Meet chimp nine.

38
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,790
视频中她正在玩汉诺塔
Here she is tasking at what is called the Lucas Tower,

39
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,820
游戏的目标是
the object of which

40
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,370
通过在三根柱子间调整每层塔的位置
is to move the tower from peg to peg,

41
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,860
使塔层从大到小排列
without placing a larger block

42
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,210
游戏中大片不能压在小片上面
on top of a smaller block.

43
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,880
不出所料  她根本无法完成游戏
As expected, she was unable to complete the puzzle at all.

44
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,220
之后  我们给她用了叫ALZ112的药
Then, we gave her what we call ALZ-112,

45
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,940
这是一种基因疗法
a gene therapy

46
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,010
促使大脑产生出新的脑细胞
that allows the brain to create its own cells

47
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,680
来完成自我修复
in order to repair itself.

48
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,060
在生物学上  这叫新生神经元
In biology, this is called neurogenesis.

49
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,400
在基因系统公司
Here at Gen-Sys,

50
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,070
我们将之视为治疗老年痴呆症的特效药
we call it the cure to Alzheimer's.

51
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,450
唐尼  你让她准备好了吗
Donnie, you get her ready?

52
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,860
她怯场了
She's got stage fright.

53
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,320
是吗
Is that what it is?

54
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,290
她要把我的手弄断了
She is going to break my hand!

55
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,300
放手  明眸  放手
Let go. Bright Eyes, let go!

56
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,090
你没事吧
Are you all right?

57
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,850
我们已准备好进入下个阶段  人体试验
We're ready to move on to the next phase. Human trials.

58
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,490
给你  明眸
Here you go, Bright Eyes.

59
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,940
这是你最喜欢的汽水  来吧
It's your favorite fizzy soda, come on.

60
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,350
开始吧  唐尼
Let's go, Donnie.

61
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,900
这回应该可以把她带下楼了
We should have her downstairs already.

62
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,160
乖孩子
Okay? Good girl.

63
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
出来吧  没事
Come on out, girl. That's right.

64
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,830
这是给你的
That's for you.

65
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,210
唐尼  套她脖子  套脖子
Around the neck, Donnie! Around the neck.

66
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,540
套脖子啊  天哪
Around the neck! Jesus!

67
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,010
唐尼  快套住她  开门啊
Donnie, do it now! Open up!

68
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,300
唐尼
Donnie!

69
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
我来麻醉她
I'm going to sedate her.

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,350
不  门  快去关门
No, no, no, no! Door! Get the door!

71
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,690
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

72
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,560
全面封锁  全面封锁
Close it down. Close it down now!

73
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,480
去找人帮忙  唐尼  站起来
Go get help. Donnie! Donnie! Come on.

74
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,940
使用112号药尚未出现任何副作用
There have been absolutely no side effects associated with 112.

75
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,160
除了一点
With one exception.

76
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,480
出于某种原因
For some reason,

77
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,660
猩猩的虹膜上出现了绿色的斑点
the chimps' irises exhibit flecks of green.

78
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,620
其实  九号猩猩是首次发现这个现象
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp nine.

79
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,610
所以我们才叫她明眸
Hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.

80
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,500
一会儿把她带来后你们就能看到
You will see when we bring her in.

81
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,380
小心
Watch out!

82
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,760
理论上
In theory,

83
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,300
这个疗法能用来
this therapy can be used

84
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,800
治疗许多种类的大脑疾病
to treat a wide range of brain disorders.

85
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,810
它的用途无可限量
It is virtually limitless.

86
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,480
所带来的经济利益也是无可限量的
As are the potential profits, which is why

87
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,110
因此我们相信你们会同意进行人体试验
we are confident that you will vote to approve human trials.

88
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,950
不要  不要
No! No!

89
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,140
雅各布先生  求你了
Mr. Jacobs? Mr. Jacobs, I am begging you.

90
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,810
求你别这么做
I am begging you not to do this.

91
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,710
花钱在实验室
Look, it would cost a small fortune to run lab work-ups

92
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,520
研究这些猩猩
on all of those chimps

93
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,060
最后也不过是我所见到的这样
only to tell me what I already know.

94
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,190
这些猩猩都被感染了
That they are contaminated.

95
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,480
他们对实验室至关重要啊
There are lives at stake here.

96
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,030
这些动物是有个性有感情的
These are animals with personalities, with attachments.

97
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,820
有感情  是的
Attachments? Yeah.

98
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,080
我经营的是公司  不是宠物园
I run a business, not a petting zoo.

99
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,710
找个最经济的办法把这些猩猩处理掉
Find the most cost-effective way to put those apes down.

100
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,900
我做不到
I can't do that.

101
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,130
你是猩猩管理员  搞定这件事
You're the chimp handler. Handle it.

102
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,290
斯蒂芬
Steven?

103
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,300
刚才真是开心一刻啊
Well, that was fun.

104
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,590
他们拿走了112号药
They've taken the 112.

105
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,340
董事会拒绝了你的申请
The board have rejected your proposal.

106
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,220
他们准备让其他项目上马
They've chosen to advance other programs.

107
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,430
你多少总能做点什么的吧
Well, there must be something that you can do.

108
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,720
是的  我可以炒了你
Yes, there is. I could fire you.

109
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,520
我没开玩笑  董事会和我讨论过
Believe me, we talked about it.

110
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,930
我们有五年的完整数据
We have five years of conclusive data.

111
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,350
尽管炫耀你的数据吧
Parade all the data you want,

112
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
没人会再投一分钱给你的项目了
you will never convince anyone to invest another dime.

113
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,980
这药能救人性命
This drug has the potential to save lives.

114
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,610
我看更有可能让公司倒闭
To bankrupt this company, more like.

115
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,410
天啊  你对人脑如此了解
I swear, you know everything about the human brain

116
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,950
却唯独不懂它的运作方式
except the way it works.

117
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,660
你从头开始开发112号药吧
Go back to the drawing board on the 112.

118
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,170
从分子开发开始
Start again in molecular development.

119
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,960
想办法比其他人早一步完成研究
Find a way to get there before someone else does.

120
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,050
还有  去收拾下这烂摊子
And clean up this mess.

121
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,150
富兰克林
Franklin?

122
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,160
猩猩生了只小猩猩
They carry small.

123
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,410
她被送来的时候肯定已经怀孕了
She must have been pregnant when they brought her in.

124
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,710
所以就因为这个
So that's why...

125
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,000
明眸

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,310
她表现出的不是侵略性  而是保护的本能
She wasn't being aggressive, she was just being protective?
明眸

127
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,250
她表现出的不是侵略性  而是保护的本能
She wasn't being aggressive, she was just being protective?

128
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,840
她以为我们要伤害她的孩子
She thought we were going to hurt her baby.

129
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,340
来抱抱
Come here.

130
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,550
我想自己养它  但我姐夫是这里的保安
I'd take him myself, but my brother-in-law works for security.

131
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,550
他肯定会告发我的
He'd rat me out in a second.

132
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,790
什么  你要我把它带回去吗
What, you want me to take it home?

133
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,680
我不懂怎么照顾猴子
I can't take care of a monkey.

134
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,740
他不是猴子  是猩猩
He's not a monkey, he's an ape.

135
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,940
富兰克林  我
Franklin, I...

136
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,290
就几天
It's just for a couple days,

137
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,270
等我给他找个安身之所  拜托了
until I find a sanctuary. That's all I need.

138
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,150
富兰克林  不行  他不是我的责任
Franklin, no. Look, this isn't my responsibility.

139
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,030
他是公司的财产
This is company property.

140
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,410
好  我这么跟你说吧  博士
Okay. I'm going to tell you what, Doc.

141
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,120
雅各布让我解决其他十二只
Jacobs made me put down the other 12.

142
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,500
我受够了
I'm done.

143
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,880
你请自便吧
Be my guest.

144
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,690
你好  你好
Hey. Hi.

145
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,490
你好像很累啊  是的
Oh, you look beat. Yeah.

146
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,200
他怎么样
How is he doing?

147
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,910
他时好时坏
Well, he has good days and bad days.

148
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,060
今天不怎么在状态
Today, not so good.

149
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,500
虽然他一直在引用莎士比亚的作品
Although, he has been quoting Shakespeare.

150
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,330
你养了只宠物啊
Oh, you got a pet.

151
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,590
就临时养养
Just a temporary house guest.

152
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,760
养只宠物可能对他有帮助
Oh. Well, it might be good for him.

153
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,840
是的  晚安
Yeah. Good night.

154
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,600
授予
荣誉证书  最受喜爱的音乐教师
查尔斯·罗德曼先生

155
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,360
你好  老爸
Hey, Dad.

156
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,280
老爸  威尔
Dad? Will!

157
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,110
我没听见你进屋
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.

158
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,030
今天是个大日子  对吧
Today is the day, right?

159
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,580
你以为我忘了
You thought I'd forget.

160
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,080
今天你有个重要的考试对吧  是化学吗
You have a big test today, right? Chemistry?

161
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,050
老爸  有东西给你看
Hey, Dad, do you want to see something?

162
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,460
什么
What?

163
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,270
这是什么  他受伤了吗
What is that? Is he injured?

164
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,100
没有  那是个胎记吧
No, I think that is a birthmark.

165
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,360
"但是对于凯撒
"But as for Caesar,
<b>出自莎士比亚《安东尼与克莉奥佩屈拉》</b>

166
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,490
他却跪下去  跪下去  惊服赞叹"
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder."

167
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,860
别太投入了
Yeah, don't get too attached.

168
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,410
他真太可爱了  是吗
He is a cute little guy, isn't he?

169
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,750
我的车钥匙呢
Where are my car keys?

170
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,090
我的车钥匙  你放哪里了  老爸
My car keys! Where did you put them? Dad.

171
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,550
你现在不开车了
You don't drive anymore.

172
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,100
我知道
I know that.

173
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,930
给你
Here,

174
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,440
你来喂他吧
why don't you feed him?

175
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
你行吗  当然可以
Can you do that? Of course I can.

176
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,700
威尔  快来看
Will, look at this.

177
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,920
他出生才多久  一两天吧
How old is he? A day old? Two days old?

178
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,250
他真聪明  不是吗
Well, he is a smart one, isn't he?

179
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,050
你准备给他起什么名字
What are you going to name him?

180
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,260
还不知道
I don't know.

181
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,360
三年后

182
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,280
自出生起
Right away,
三年后

183
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,990
三年后
凯撒就显示出了高智慧的迹象
Caesar displayed signs of heightened intelligence.

184
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,070
凯撒就显示出了高智慧的迹象
Caesar displayed signs of heightened intelligence.

185
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,950
所以我留下了他并在家里进行研究工作
So I kept him and brought my work home.

186
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,170
他十八个月时
By 18 months,

187
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,000
已会二十四个单词的手语了
Caesar was signing up to 24 words.

188
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,510
他两岁时
By age two,

189
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,430
就能完成为八岁以上小孩
Caesar was completing puzzles and models

190
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,310
设计的模型游戏
designed for children eight years and up.

191
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,610
他三岁时
At age three,

192
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,900
所显示出的认知能力
Caesar continues to show cognitive skills

193
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,900
远远超过与他同龄的人类小孩
that far exceed that of a human counterpart.

194
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,110
家  家
Home. Home.

195
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,660
他用十五步完成了汉诺塔
He completed the Lucas Tower in fifteen moves,

196
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,410
满分
a perfect score.

197
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,870
我坚持我的假设
I maintain my hypothesis

198
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,790
首先  他眼球上的绿色斑点
that, A, the green in his eyes

199
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,790
说明ALZ112的药效
indicates that the ALZ-112

200
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,840
通过母婴遗传传给了他
was passed genetically from mother to son

201
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,260
其次  由于没有需要修复的受损脑细胞
and, B, that in the absence of damaged cells that need replacing,

202
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,150
他体内的药物
the drug in his system has

203
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,220
大幅提升了健康大脑的机能
radically boosted healthy brain functioning.

204
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,980
而且
And,

205
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,690
他象棋下得极好
he plays chess pretty well.

206
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,860
这是我的台灯  是我的房间
It's my lamp! And my room!

207
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,030
老爸
Dad?

208
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,040
这儿不需要你
I don't need you here.

209
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,780
伊琳娜  对不住了
lrena, l'm sorry.

210
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,490
这活儿没法干了
I can't do this anymore.

211
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,470
应该送他去老人院
He belongs in a home.

212
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,990
他没办法这样继续生活了
This is no way for him to live.

213
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,630
是的  没法活了
Yeah, and no way to live.

214
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
没法活了
No way to live.

215
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,300
这是我的台灯  我一直
Now, it's my lamp. I'm always...

216
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,010
ALZ112

217
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,270
老爸  这药会让你好起来的
It'll make you better, Dad.

218
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,980
老爸
Dad?

219
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,840
多得  进屋来吃早饭了
Todd! Come inside for breakfast!

220
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,570
我要记下从实验室拿的药品
I'll need to keep track of what I take from the lab.

221
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,590
尽管如此  我想
Although, I don't foresee

222
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,240
你一个月用一支完全够了
you needing more than one treatment a month.

223
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,830
奇迹发生了  是啊
Something amazing has happened. Yeah.

224
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,150
我要给你验个血做个扫描
I'll need a blood test,

225
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,700
再分析下用药的剂量
and a scan and the dosage.

226
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,420
必须对你进行仔细的观察  威尔
You'll have to be carefully monitored. Will...

227
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,670
如果我能带些
Now if I can sneak some...

228
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,040
威尔  干嘛
Will! Yeah?

229
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,210
我的病好了
I'm not sick anymore.

230
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,460
愿意效劳
It was nothing, Dad.

231
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,930
凯撒  他去哪里了  我要看看他
Caesar. Where's Caesar? I want to see him.

232
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,980
凯撒
Caesar?

233
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,940
凯撒
Caesar!

234
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,440
他应该不会跑远的
All right, he can't have gone far.

235
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,280
凯撒
Caesar!

236
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,740
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy? Daddy!

237
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,070
凯撒
Caesar!

238
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,410
滚出去  滚
Get out of here! Get out!

239
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,120
滚出去
Get out! Get out of here!

240
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,040
住手  够了
Hey, hey, hey! Enough! Enough!

241
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,340
你他妈怎么回事啊
The hell is the matter with you?

242
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,670
如果那畜生再靠近我家或是我的孩子
If I see that animal anywhere near my house or my kids again...

243
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,920
他没有威胁的
He's not dangerous.

244
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,930
不会有下次了  最好别有
It won't happen again. Damn right, it won't.

245
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,600
走吧  老爸
Come on, Dad.

246
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,430
他只是想玩玩
He just wanted to play.

247
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,100
待家里  老爸处理好了
Stay in the house. Daddy's got it.

248
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,440
告诉过你别一个人出门
I told you not to go out without us.

249
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,400
天啊  没事了
Oh, God. It's okay.

250
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,490
严重吗
How bad is it?

251
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,450
我不知道
I don't know.

252
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,300
他喜欢你
He likes you.

253
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,050
别担心
Don't worry.

254
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,140
很快就弄好了  之后给你买好吃的
It'll be over soon and we can go get a treat.

255
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,600
冰激凌怎么样
I'm thinking ice cream.

256
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,360
好主意
Good idea.

257
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,320
你教会他用手语了
You taught him to sign?

258
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,740
就些简单的词
Just a handful of things.

259
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,320
都是些最基本的
Basic stuff.

260
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,910
他在说什么
What's he saying?

261
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,040
没什么
Nothing.

262
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,080
你看我们什么时候来复诊
So, when do you think we should come back?

263
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,740
你们不需要复诊
Well, you won't need to

264
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,630
缝合的线是可溶性的
come back because the stitches are dissolvable.

265
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,300
就是要注意有没有感染
I would just say watch out for signs of infection.

266
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,050
发热  红肿什么的
Fever, redness.

267
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,090
好吧  这次他在说什么
Okay. What's he saying now?

268
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,730
他说你和我应该一起吃顿饭
Well, he thinks that you and I should have dinner together.

269
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,940
很怪是吧
I know.

270
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,820
凯撒  走吧
Hey, Caesar. Come on.

271
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
卡罗琳  很高兴再见到你
Good to see you again, Caroline.

272
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,530
凯撒  你来吗
You coming, Caesar?

273
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,870
你教他的秘诀是什么
So, what's your secret?

274
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,790
不是我的功劳  是他遗传得好
I can't take any credit. It's in his genes.

275
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,170
你太谦虚了  他真的太棒了
I think you're being very modest. He's pretty amazing.

276
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,800
你在这儿给凯撒营造了个很温馨的家
I think you've built a pretty good home for Caesar here.

277
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,220
但是
But?

278
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,350
他不会一直这么点大
He won't stay this way for long.

279
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,100
他很快就会长成又大又壮的
He's gonna soon grow into a large, powerful animal.

280
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,140
过来
Come here.

281
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,150
他最近好吗
How has he been doing?

282
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,730
我想还不错
Okay. I think.

283
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,900
我喜欢猩猩  但是我也害怕他们
I love chimpanzees. I'm also afraid of them.

284
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,740
有这种畏惧之情很正常
And it's appropriate to be afraid of them.

285
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,320
凯撒不会伤害别人的
Caesar would never hurt anyone.

286
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,040
他在这儿很开心
He's happy here. Come on.

287
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,910
是的  看得出
Yeah, I can see that.

288
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,090
我们至少该给他些室外活动吧
Can we at least give him some open space?

289
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,590
没错  这是个好主意
Yeah. That probably would be a good idea.

290
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,060
我知道个地方  过了桥就到
I know a place right across the bridge.

291
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,680
红树林  那儿美极了
The redwoods. It's paradise.

292
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,570
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

293
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,870
过来
Come here.

294
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,160
不用给他套绳索  他没问题的  走吧
He doesn't need a leash. He'll be fine. Come on.

295
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,080
安全起见  走吧
Just to be safe. Come on.

296
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,960
来吧  凯撒
Come on, Caesar.

297
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,880
这儿就是红树林
This is the redwoods.

298
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,470
凯撒  听着
Caesar? All right.

299
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,940
如果我把项圈解下来  你可不能跑远啊
If I take this off, you cannot leave my sight.

300
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,480
你跑远了我就找不到你了  好吗
I would never find you again. Okay.

301
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,240
这是什么意思  他在干什么
What is this? What's he doing?

302
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,150
真不敢相信
I don't believe that.

303
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,240
怎么了  他在请求你的允许
What? He's asking your permission.

304
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,530
这是恳求的手势
It's a supplicating gesture.

305
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,910
没事
It's okay.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,500
去吧  凯撒  去玩吧
Come on, Caesar. Off you go!

307
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,430
去看着他
Look at him go.

308
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,930
凯撒  凯撒
Caesar! Caesar!

309
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,400
凯撒  凯撒
Caesar! Caesar!

310
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,020
凯撒
Caesar!

311
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,530
你在这
There you are.

312
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,120
凯撒
Caesar?

313
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,870
去吧  凯撒  爬上去
Go on, Caesar. Climb!

314
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,750
爬高点
Go higher.

315
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,630
爬吧
Climb!

316
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,390
小心点
Just be careful.

317
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,020
凯撒  小心
Caesar, be careful!

318
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,780
五年后

319
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,950
你好啊
Hi.

320
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,910
怎么样  老兄
What's going on, buddy?

321
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,460
也给你分点爱
You get some love, too.

322
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,290
快点  亲爱的
Come on, honey.

323
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,840
那不是一头黑猩猩吗
Is that a chimpanzee?

324
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,130
你好
Hi.

325
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,510
停下
Come on!

326
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,930
快走
Come on.

327
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,520
凯撒  凯撒
Caesar? Caesar.

328
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,980
快走
Come on.

329
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,650
没事了  快走吧
It's all right. Come on.

330
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,910
好了  来吧
All right, come on.

331
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,210
我们走  你不上车吗
Let's go. You getting in?

332
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,090
凯撒
Caesar?

333
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,770
你还好吗  老弟
You okay, pal?

334
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,110
你是宠物吗  不
Are you a pet? No.

335
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,110
你不是宠物
You're not a pet.

336
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,870
我是你爸爸
I'm your father.

337
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,670
凯撒从哪里来
What is Caesar?

338
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,930
好吧
Okay.

339
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,600
凯撒  这是我工作的地方
Caesar, this is where I work.

340
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,730
也是你出生的地方
This is where you were born.

341
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,360
你妈妈曾经和其他黑猩猩住在这里
Your mother was here with other chimpanzees.

342
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,070
但是她现在已经不在了
But she's not here anymore.

343
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,490
所以
So,

344
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,870
我才把你带回家跟我一起住
that's why I took you home to live with me.

345
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,380
对
Yeah.

346
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,970
你妈妈去世了
Your mother is dead.

347
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,350
事实是  她被注射了药物
The thing is, she was given medicine.

348
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,270
和我给查尔斯用的是同一种药
Like the medicine I give to Charles.

349
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,020
她把药物影响遗传给了你
She passed it on to you.

350
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,310
所以你才这么聪明
That's why you're so smart.

351
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,650
我们带他回家吧
Let's take him home.

352
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,990
好的
Okay.

353
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,960
过来  给我解释解释
Come on, explain it to me.

354
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,960
好吧
All right.

355
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,800
我为了救他把他偷偷带出实验室
I snuck him out of the lab to save his life.

356
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,250
那个时候我根本不知道
I had no idea that the effects

357
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,430
药物影响已经从他妈妈那直接遗传给他了
had been transferred vertically from his mother.

358
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,180
但自那个时候起
But since then, he's been

359
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,600
他就显示出惊人的高智力水平
displaying incredible signs of intelligence.

360
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,610
我设计药物112是为了治病
I designed the 112 for repair,

361
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,770
但凯撒所表现出的已经远超我的初衷
but Caesar has gone way beyond that.

362
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,110
这是他去年的智商
Here is his lQ from last year.

363
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,150
从那时起到现在  他的智商已经翻倍
Since then, it's doubled.

364
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,070
这样不对  威尔
This is wrong, Will.

365
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,890
我的父亲曾经病入膏肓
My father was gone.

366
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,410
这种药治好了他
This drug brought him back.

367
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,160
你从没见过他重病的样子
You never saw how bad he was.

368
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,910
他重获新生了  那凯撒怎么办
He has his life again. And what about Caesar?

369
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,790
他怎么了  他怎么生活
What about him? Where does he fit in?

370
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
跟我过
With me.

371
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,960
跟我们过
With us.

372
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,710
听着
Listen,

373
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,050
我知道对你来说很难
I know it's been hard for you,

374
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,870
但是你在试图控制
but you're trying to control

375
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,390
本不应该受控的东西
things that are not meant to be controlled.

376
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,510
112号药起作用了
The 112 works.

377
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,520
你意识到你在说什么吗
Do you realize how you sound?

378
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,100
我只是想说  这是件好事
All I'm saying is, this is a good thing.

379
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,270
凯撒就是证据  我父亲也是
Caesar is proof of that. So is my father.

380
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,190
凯撒  吃饭
Caesar, eat your food.

381
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,390
爸爸  你还好吗
Dad, are you okay?

382
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,770
我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

383
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,150
抗体
Antibodies.

384
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,660
他的机能对112号药产生了抗体
His system has found a way to fight the 112 virus

385
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,870
所以药物无法发挥疗效了
so that it can't deliver its therapy.

386
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,450
我父亲比以前病的更重了
My father's disease is going to return with a vengeance.

387
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,550
宝贝  你看见车蜡了吗
Honey, have you seen the car wax?

388
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,090
是台福特野马
It's a Mustang.

389
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,480
看起来美极了  我做了什么
It's looking great. What did I do...

390
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,260
停下
Stop!

391
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,760
你现在就给我停下
You stop right now!

392
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,390
给我出来  从车里出来
Get out of there! Get out of that car!

393
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,980
你他妈在干什么  从我车里滚出来
What the hell are you doing? Get out of my car!

394
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,440
我说了  给我滚出来
I said get out of my car!

395
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,730
我是个飞行员  我还得去机场呢
I'm a pilot! I got to get to the airport!

396
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,280
我现在怎么去机场
How am I going to get there now, huh?

397
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,150
你他妈给我个回答  你犯什么病了
Answer the goddamned question! What were you doing?

398
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,400
我也有辆车
I have a car just...

399
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,950
这不明摆着
Well, it's not obviously...

400
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,660
我听够了  让警察来处理
That's it, I'm done. The police can handle this.

401
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,490
你给我老实待着  你哪都不许去
You stay right there! You are going nowhere, mister!

402
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,910
你或是你儿子得给我赔偿损失
You or your son are going to pay for this!

403
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,670
反正我一个子儿不出
But I sure as hell am not going to!

404
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,580
这是你的问题  你把我车撞坏了
This is your problem! You made the mess!

405
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,340
我受够你们爷俩了  我这就
I'm sick of the two of you! I'm not going...

406
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,010
你给我待着别动
You stay right there!

407
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,510
不
No!

408
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,670
不
No!

409
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,920
不要  不要
No! No!

410
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,380
凯撒  住手
Caesar! Stop!

411
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,390
爸爸
Daddy!

412
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,350
不  不
No, no.

413
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,900
凯撒
Caesar!

414
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,200
好了
It's okay.

415
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,250
没事了  你不是故意的
It's okay. You didn't mean it.

416
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,130
没事了
It's okay.

417
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,160
动物管制

418
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,320
把那东西从他身上拿下来
Hey. Take that thing off of him.

419
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,950
你能不能把那东西拿掉  拜托
Will you take that thing off of him? Come on.

420
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,820
这样  我带他进去  行吗
Look. I'll take him in, okay?

421
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,990
不行  按照法院的命令  你不能
No, he's under court orders. You can't do that.

422
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,580
没关系  让他来吧
It's fine, let him.

423
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:05,870
准备好了就带他进来吧
Bring him in when you're ready.

424
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,540
拿掉它  谢谢你
Take it off. Thank you.

425
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,090
凯撒  凯撒  凯撒  凯撒  凯撒
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar, Caesar? Caesar.

426
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,970
现在不能回家  会没事的
Not right now. It's gonna be okay.

427
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,220
我们去看看里面什么样  好吗
Let's just see what it's like inside, okay?

428
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,300
来吧  凯撒  我们走
Come on, Caesar. Let's go.

429
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,730
来吧  相信我
Come on. Trust me.

430
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,830
还不错
It's okay.

431
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,830
去吧
Go on.

432
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,680
他从来没跟其他猩猩一起生活过
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.

433
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,680
我们常处理这种情况
We're used to that.

434
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,290
一开始他会有一点焦躁
He'll be a little skittish at first,

435
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,020
不过我们会帮他融入进去的
but we'll integrate him.

436
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
你会惊讶于他们的适应能力
You'd be surprised how quick they adapt.

437
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,020
我们提供了一个很刺激的环境
We provide a stimulating environment.

438
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,860
他在这会茁壮成长
He's going to thrive here.

439
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,900
来吧  我们还得签几份文件
Come on, let's do some paperwork.

440
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,200
对了  进来的时候别忘了锁门
Oh, and make sure you lock that door when you come in.

441
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,060
凯撒
Caesar.

442
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,980
你会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

443
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,770
一切都会好起来
Everything is gonna be okay.

444
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,940
别害怕
Don't be scared.

445
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,240
你现在就暂住在这
You're gonna stay here now.

446
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,160
不行
No.

447
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,160
我们现在不能回家
We're not going home right now.

448
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,580
没事的
It's okay.

449
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,660
经验之谈  告别拖得越长
In our experience, the longer you drag out the goodbyes,

450
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,710
分手就越艰难
the harder it is.

451
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,090
我等一下再签好吗
Can I just sign that later?

452
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,710
十有八九他想你赶不上你想他多
You'll probably miss him more than he'll miss you.

453
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,760
给他几个星期让他适应这个地方就好了
Best give him a couple of weeks to get used to the place.

454
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,590
威尔  我们得走了
Will, we have to go.

455
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,680
我们得回家了
We have to go home.

456
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,770
我很快回来看你  好吗
I'm coming back soon, okay?

457
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,110
来之前打个电话就行
Just call ahead before you do.

458
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,820
过来
Hey, over here!

459
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,740
我能把你弄出去
Hey, I can get you out!

460
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,790
快来  过来
Come on. Over here.

461
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,560
快来  到下面来
Come on. Hey. Down here.

462
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,280
蠢猴子
Stupid monkey.

463
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,220
你就这点本事吗  放马过来吧
Is that all you got? Come on!

464
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,720
这就是一疯人院
It's a madhouse!

465
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,720
疯人院
It's a madhouse!

466
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,110
法院还没定案  所以系统中查不到
Court order hasn't been filed, so it's not in the system.

467
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,690
归档之后
Once it comes through,

468
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,360
您将在九十天之内获知上诉日期
it'll take about 90 days before you receive an appeal date.

469
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,280
九十天  是的  先生  九十天
90 days? Yes, sir, 90 days.

470
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
我们会以邮件形式通知您  等等
You'll be notified by mail. Hang on.

471
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,430
我来告诉你应该怎么做
Right. Here's what's gonna happen.

472
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,870
你坐回电脑旁
You're going to go back on your computer,

473
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,660
给我调整一下日程
you're gonna shift things around,

474
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,750
在这个星期安排一个
and you're going to get me

475
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,410
上诉日给我  懂了吗
a date for my appeal this week. You got it?

476
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,210
我帮不了您
I can't help you.

477
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,940
这么说我们要有麻烦了
All right, then we have a problem.

478
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,250
你要是不给我弄到我就不走了
Because l'm not moving until you do.

479
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,880
九十天  先生
90 days, sir.

480
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,470
能给你个上诉日你就该很感激了
Be thankful you're talking about court dates.

481
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,720
他们没打死那头畜生已经算你走运了
You're lucky they didn't put that animal down.

482
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,100
我一定尽快把他带回家  爸爸
I promise to get him back soon, Dad.

483
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,600
爸爸
Dad?

484
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,900
我父亲的免疫系统继续排斥112号药物
My father's immune system continues to reject the 112 virus,

485
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,530
基因治疗逐渐失效
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.

486
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,000
他的健康状况日渐恶化
His health is deteriorating,

487
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,910
而且病情也越发凶猛
and the disease is progressing rapidly.

488
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,500
我需要一种更强效的病毒品种
I need a more aggressive virus strain.

489
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
一种更快速的传导机制
A faster delivery method.

490
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,460
因为在这样的恶化速度之下
Because at this rate...

491
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,300
我不能失去他们两个
I can't lose them both.

492
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,770
我不会失去他们两个的
I won't lose them both.

493
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,320
我们能谈谈吗
Hi. Can we talk?

494
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,940
长话短说  我还有个会
Make it fast. I've got a meeting.

495
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,910
你经管基因系统公司十年了
In the 10 years you've been running Gen-Sys,

496
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,240
你推出过几种一下生产线
how many drugs have come down the pipeline

497
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,290
就能拯救千万生命
that could save millions of lives,

498
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,790
就能改变世界的药品呢
that could change everything?

499
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,660
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

500
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,460
ALZ112
The ALZ-112.

501
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,500
你怎么回事  威尔
What happened to you, Will?

502
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,630
你曾经是这个实验室的明星
You used to be the star of this lab.

503
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,880
但现在你都不怎么露面  就算露面
Now you hardly ever show, and when you do,

504
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,200
你也是把你和整个团队的时间
you waste your time and

505
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,550
浪费在钻研一种
that of your team's fixating on a drug that,

506
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,260
在经历那件事之后永远不会获批的药物上
after what happened, is never, ever going to get approved.

507
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,630
112号药是危险品  威尔
The 112 is dangerous, Will,

508
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,680
而且它没有效
and it doesn't work.

509
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,810
我在我爸爸身上试验了  它有效
I treated my father with it. It does work.

510
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,070
你干了什么  你干了什么
You did what? You did what?

511
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,320
他战胜了病魔  跟我们预测的一样
He beat the disease. Like we predicted.

512
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,740
把他带来  但是有一个并发症
Bring him in. There's been a complication.

513
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,120
那它到底有没有效呢
Well, does it work, or doesn't it?

514
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,700
我父亲的病最终复发了
My father's disease eventually outran the cure.

515
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,200
天哪
For goodness sake.

516
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,870
他的免疫系统对病毒产生了抗体
His immune system produced antibodies that beat the viral component,

517
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,170
但是它会有效的
but it will work.

518
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,010
我已经研发出一个病种
I've already developed a virus

519
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,590
我认为会更有效
strain that I think will be more aggressive.

520
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,170
你认为
You think?

521
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,010
只要让我开始试验
Just let me test it.

522
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,840
你是在浪费我的时间
You're wasting my time.

523
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,470
还有
There's more.

524
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,270
这种药物的作用已经不止于治病
The applications go beyond the disease.

525
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,480
有迹象表明
There are indications that show

526
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,440
该疗法能改善认知机能和记忆质量
that therapy can improve cognitive functioning, memory quality...

527
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,730
你说什么
What are you saying?

528
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,900
我的父亲不仅痊愈了  他还进步了
My father didn't just recover. He improved.

529
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,240
你是说智力增长吗
You mean increased intelligence?

530
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,660
还不很肯定  但是没错
It's not conclusive, but yes.

531
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,330
我要你尽快在黑猩猩上
I want you to start testing

532
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,120
试验改进后的112号药
the revised 112 on chimps ASAP.

533
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,670
好的  我会全力支持你
Okay. I'll give you whatever you need.

534
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,130
绝对的
Absolutely.

535
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,760
吃晚饭了
Dinner time!

536
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,560
A级灵长类专用炒饭
Grade A primate chow.

537
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,980
吃吧
Go on.

538
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,360
看见食物也不认识了吗
Don't you know food when you see it?

539
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,330
你觉得挺好玩是吧
You think that's funny, huh?

540
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,960
我给你看点好玩的
I'll show you something funny.

541
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,390
他马上就知道谁是老大了
He'll learn who's boss soon enough.

542
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,860
他的衣服怎么办  衣服怎么了
What about his clothes? What about them?

543
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
我也不知道
I don't know.

544
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,610
其他猿猴看见了可能不太高兴
It might cause problems with the other apes.

545
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,620
再好不过
Good.

546
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,370
基因系统公司

547
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,600
我数过了  十只猩猩  对吗
I've counted 10 apes. Correct?

548
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,850
对
Yep.

549
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,350
很好  一直推到最后面
Good. All the way to the back.

550
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,520
好的
Okay.

551
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,020
你们这个项目动作够快的  着什么急
You guys are moving really quick on this. What's the big rush?

552
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,980
回来第一天  你还是在抱怨
First day back, and you're still complaining.

553
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,210
库巴  你好  我是威尔
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

554
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,850
就这只
Okay. This one.

555
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,680
他非常镇定
He's very calm.

556
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,770
是啊  这家伙可没少见识实验室
Yeah, this guy has seen the inside of a whole lot of labs.

557
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,560
程序他都知道
He knows the drill.

558
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,480
我能加入吗
Thought I'd join you.

559
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,400
看看进度
Watch our progress.

560
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,900
帮他准备好
Get him prepped.

561
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,330
戴好你的面具
Tighten your masks.

562
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,240
把113号药递给我
Pass me the 113.

577
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,640
好的
Okay.

578
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,940
对不起
Sorry about that.

579
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,310
这帮家伙比我恢复的好多了
These guys are more resilient than I am.

580
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,940
失陪一下
Excuse me a sec.

这只可以了
He's good.

585
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:33,380
小心  人类不喜欢太聪明的猩猩
Careful. Human no like smart Ape.

586
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,660
基因系统公司

Don't worry. God, what have they done to you?

596
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,190
你放屁  你怎么他了
That's bullshit. What the hell did you do?

597
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,200
算了  哥们  嘿  出什么事了
Let go, man. Hey! What's the problem here?

我现在就要带他出去
I'm taking him out of here. Right now.

没有法院的指令  休想
Not without a court order, you're not.

600
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,710
他不再属于你了
He's not yours anymore.

601
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:50,170
听好了  如果我发现他有一丁点遭虐待
I promise, if I find out he's been mistreated in any way,

602
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,250
我一定关了这地方
I'll have this place shut down.

603
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,380
你继续
Go on.

604
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:04,970
不是
No.

605
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,480
不行  你还不能马上回家
No, we're not going home right now.

606
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,150
我一定会带你出去的  我发誓
But I'm going to get you out of here. I promise.

607
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,980
相信我
You have to trust me.

608
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,070
凯撒  相信我  好吗

609
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,240
探视时间到
I think this visit is over.

610
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,280
相信我  会好起来的
Trust me. It'll be okay.

611
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,540
快点  动起来  过来
Come on! Move it! Let's go!

612
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,500
有一百多只呢
Wow! There's hundreds of them.

613
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,340
简直是你的私人动物园
This is like your own private zoo.

614
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,760
更像是多毛家伙们的监狱
More like a prison for hairy dudes.

615
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,590
它们还有电视看啊
They watch TV?

616
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,680
我们称之为丰富生活
We call it enrichment.

617
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,100
这一只好可爱哦
This one's so cute!

618
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,600
他叫什么
What's his name?

619
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,650
叫康奈利娅  是母的
The name is Cornelia. It's a she.

620
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,780
哦天哪  别靠得太近
Oh, my God! Don't get too close.

621
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,530
这一只差点吓死我
This one scared me half to death.

622
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,740
那个大家伙叫毛利斯
Yeah. That big guy's called Maurice.

623
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,490
没意思
No fun.

624
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,620
过来  我给你看点有意思的
Here, I'll show you something fun.

625
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,040
看好了
Check this out.

626
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,840
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

627
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,920
你们不该进来
You shouldn't be in here.

628
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,340
下一个就电你
Hey, you're next!

629
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,020
好了  我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

630
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,310
这儿我都呆腻了
I spend too much time in here as it is.

631
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,440
走吧
Come on.

632
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,270
看看这家伙
Check out this guy.

633
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,230
那一只最烦人
Hey, that one is a pain in the ass.

634
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
特自以为是
Thinks he's special or something.

635
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,820
诡异
Freaky.

636
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,280
过来
Hey, come here.

637
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,950
他好像在思考什么似的
It's like he's thinking or something...

638
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,920
天哪  他掐住他的喉咙了
Oh, my God! He's got his throat!

639
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,370
放了他  快放了他
Let him go! Let go!

640
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,420
你没事吧  没事
Are you okay? I'm okay.

641
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,420
哥们  说了别靠得太近的
I told you not to get too close, man.

642
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,340
快点  伙计们  走吧
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.

643
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,130
《凯撒传》

644
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,730
有些事是无法改变的
Some things aren't meant to be changed.

645
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,140
你得接受这个事实
You need to accept that.

646
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,480
你们在搞什么
Hey! What's going on here?

647
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,060
多试验一下113号  我们正准备
More 113 trials. We're just prepping...

648
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,820
不行  我们得先分析库巴的血液情况
No, we have to analyze Koba's blood work first.

649
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,980
富兰克林晓得程序  他人呢
Franklin knows this. Where is he?

650
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,490
他已经生病两天了
He's been out sick for two days.

651
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,240
我没有授权这么做
Well, I didn't authorize this.

652
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,160
你是没有
No.

653
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,410
我授权的
I did.

654
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,910
我们说好先只在一个受体上保守试验的
We agreed to test sparingly on one subject.

655
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,410
那个受体表现惊人
And that one subject is stunning.

656
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,940
这是一种病毒
It's a virus,

657
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,630
还不知道它对人体的影响
we don't know the human-related effects.

658
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,960
药有效  威尔  告诉他  琳达
The drug works, Will. Tell him, Linda.

659
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,420
作为新手  库巴在汉诺塔中拿到了满分
For starters, Koba scored a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

660
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,550
每一次试验都验证了它的药效
Every test result verifies its effectiveness.

661
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,180
不能再试验了  你在说什么
No more tests. What are you...

662
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,400
直到我们弄清楚
Not until we have a better understanding

663
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,430
我们在做什么
of what we're dealing with.

664
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,270
我来告诉你我们在面对些什么
Look, I'll tell you exactly what we're...

665
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,470
等我们一会儿
Look. Just give us a minute.

666
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,980
有劳  请把大猩猩放回笼子  温柔点
Excuse me, put the ape back in the cage, and be gentle.

667
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,770
威尔  我来告诉你我们在做什么
Will, I'll tell you exactly what we're dealing with here.

668
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,820
我们在做一种
We're dealing with a drug

669
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,020
比我们所有其他的研究加起来
that is worth more than everything else

670
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:19,990
还要值钱的药
we are developing combined.

671
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,680
你创造历史  我赚大钱
You make history, I make money.

672
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,280
不正如你我所愿吗
Wasn't that our arrangement?

673
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,780
不行  风险太大
No, there are risks.

674
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,830
别跟我谈什么风险
Don't talk to me about risks.

675
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:31,330
你给自己的父亲用上了实验中的药物
You gave your own father an experimental drug.

676
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,710
我一个电话就可以结束你的职业生涯
I could finish your career with one phone call.

677
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,250
不用麻烦你了  我辞职
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.

678
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,550
没有你我们还是会继续
We will proceed without you.

679
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:44,140
听着  你不知道你在做什么
Look, you don't know what you're doing.

680
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,680
这些实验需要有遏制
These tests need to be contained.

681
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,140
你都不知道113号是否稳定
You have no idea if the 113 is stable,

682
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,520
会对人体带来怎样的伤害
what kind of damage it can do to people.

683
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,600
正是如此  我们才在猩猩上试验
Yes. Well, that is why we test it on chimps.

684
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,730
不是吗
Isn't it?

685
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,310
罗德曼博士  是我  富兰克林
Dr. Rodman, it's me, Franklin!

686
01:00:59,310 --> 01:00:59,980
我有话对你说
I need to talk to you!

687
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,070
请为我开门
Can you come to the door?

688
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,500
博士
Doc?

689
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,460
你他妈是谁
Who the hell are you?

690
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,970
滚出去
Get out of here!

691
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,840
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

692
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,990
你不是想陷害我吧
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me, would you?

693
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,120
我不能说我同意了
Well, I can't say I approve.

694
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,950
它们又不是人
They're not people, you know.

695
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,750
你到底让不让他离开
You gonna let him go or not?

696
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,850
凯撒  嘿  过来
Caesar? Hey, come on.

697
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,810
来呀  我们回家
Come on, we're going home.

698
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,600
回家
Home.

699
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,940
过来  是真的
Come on, we're really going.

700
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:24,820
来  我们离开这儿
Come on. Let's get out of here.

701
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
过来
Come on.

702
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,760
凯撒?
Caesar?
