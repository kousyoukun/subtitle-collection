2
00:03:04,51 --> 00:03:08,85
好吧，好吧，这样就行
Hey, okay ... now...

3
00:03:10,69 --> 00:03:12,10
我们再做一次
let's go again.

4
00:03:14,11 --> 00:03:15,69
哪个在做实验？九号吗？
Which one's this, number9? - Yeah, number 9.  Bright eyes.

5
00:03:15,77 --> 00:03:17,23
对，这是九号

6
00:03:17,48 --> 00:03:19,48
美瞳，我们这么称呼她的

7
00:03:20,45 --> 00:03:22,28
你在看吗？
Are you watching this?

8
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:26,28
这真是不可置信
This, this is unbelieveable.

9
00:03:30,33 --> 00:03:32,04
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

10
00:03:33,13 --> 00:03:34,11
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

11
00:03:38,34 --> 00:03:40,17
一那有多少步？ 一20
How many moves was that? - 20.

12
00:03:40,92 --> 00:03:42,41
对，完美的分数是15
The perfect score is 15. God, what, what are you giving her?

13
00:03:42,76 --> 00:03:43,84
博士，你给了她什么？

14
00:03:44,14 --> 00:03:45,25
嘿，给我那个视频！
Hey, give me that video!

15
00:03:51,06 --> 00:03:53,60
黑猩猩九号，只打了一剂
Chimp number 9, just one dose.

16
00:03:53,69 --> 00:03:54,93
稍后我会见到你么？
Couldn't I see you later? - We're good to go.

17
00:03:55,02 --> 00:03:56,23
我们准备好演示了

18
00:03:56,31 --> 00:03:58,65
我会给你回电话 对，好的，谢谢，再见
I'm going to call you back. Yeah, all right.  Thanks, Bye.

19
00:03:58,73 --> 00:04:00,02
112是有效的
112, it works.

20
00:04:01,36 --> 00:04:02,98
只试过一只猿而已
On just the one primate? - One is all we need.

21
00:04:03,07 --> 00:04:07,11
一只就足够了 完全的认知恢复，我们准备好了

22
00:04:04,87 --> 00:04:06,56
Full cognitive recovery.

23
00:04:07,74 --> 00:04:11,03
你确定你没有太赶吗？
We're ready.

24
00:04:07,53 --> 00:04:10,15
Look, are you sure you're not rushing this?

25
00:04:11,12 --> 00:04:12,86
我已经花了五年半时间了
I've been working on this for five and a half years.

26
00:04:13,50 --> 00:04:15,28
数据很清楚
The data is clear. We're ready, Steven.

27
00:04:15,38 --> 00:04:16,74
我们准备好了，史蒂芬

28
00:04:16,84 --> 00:04:18,92
我唯一需要的就是你关于人类试验的批准
All I need is your approval for human trials.

29
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:20,67
关于这个你需要得到董事会的批准
Oh, for this, you're going to need the Board's approval.

30
00:04:21,34 --> 00:04:23,63
有大量的金钱栽在这上面，威尔
There's a lot of money riding on this, Will.

31
00:04:23,72 --> 00:04:24,96
你只有一个机会
You only get one shot. - One shot is all I need.

32
00:04:25,05 --> 00:04:26,96
一个机会对我而言就够了

33
00:04:29,31 --> 00:04:30,31
[sighs]

34
00:04:31,18 --> 00:04:32,59
好吧，但是我要看看
All right. I'll need to see all the research.

35
00:04:32,68 --> 00:04:34,55
一所有的研究 一那是当然的
You got it!

36
00:04:34,64 --> 00:04:36,10
一还有，威尔… 一什么事儿？
Oh, and Will ... - Yeah?

37
00:04:36,86 --> 00:04:38,97
把你自身的情感置之度外
Keep your personal emotions out of it.

38
00:04:39,07 --> 00:04:41,81
这些人投资的是结果，不是梦想
These people invest in results, not dreams.

39
00:04:41,90 --> 00:04:43,02
好
Okay!

40
00:04:45,82 --> 00:04:46,94
来见见黑猩猩九号
Meet chimp 9. Here she's tasking at what is called the Lucas Tower.

41
00:04:47,49 --> 00:04:50,78
这里她在完成叫卢卡斯塔的一项任务

42
00:04:50,87 --> 00:04:54,36
目的是把塔一个一个桩地移开
The object of which is to move the tower from peg to peg

43
00:04:54,46 --> 00:04:58,20
不能把大的积木放在小积木上
without placing a larger block on top of a smaller block.

44
00:04:58,29 --> 00:05:01,88
如我所料，她根本无法完成这个谜题游戏
As expected, she was unable to complete the puzzle at all.

45
00:05:01,96 --> 00:05:06,21
然后，我们给了她我们称为ALZ一1 12的东西
Then, we gave her what we call, ALZ-112, a gene therapy

46
00:05:07,05 --> 00:05:11,01
这是一种基因疗程 允许大脑创建自己的细胞

47
00:05:08,56 --> 00:05:13,40
that allows the brain to create its own cells in order to repair itself.

48
00:05:11,10 --> 00:05:12,68
来修复自身

49
00:05:13,39 --> 00:05:17,38
生物学上，这叫神经形成 这里在基希斯
In biology, this is called neurogenesis.

50
00:05:16,57 --> 00:05:18,37
Here, at GEN-SYS,

51
00:05:18,94 --> 00:05:21,06
我们把它称为阿尔茨海默病克星
we call it a cure to Alzheimer's.

52
00:05:24,95 --> 00:05:26,44
东尼，你帮她准备好了么？
Donnie, you get her ready? - She's got stage fright.

53
00:05:26,53 --> 00:05:27,86
她怯场了

54
00:05:28,03 --> 00:05:29,32
是这样的吗？
Is that what it is?

55
00:05:34,96 --> 00:05:36,41
嘿！嘿！
Hey, ape.

56
00:05:40,25 --> 00:05:41,29
她要弄断我的手了！
She's gonna break my arm!

57
00:05:41,46 --> 00:05:43,29
放手，美瞳，放手！
Bright Eyes! Let go!

58
00:05:47,76 --> 00:05:49,09
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

59
00:05:56,39 --> 00:05:59,85
我们准备继续到下一阶段 人类试验
We're ready to move on to the next phase.

60
00:05:58,48 --> 00:06:00,67
Human trials.

61
00:06:01,48 --> 00:06:04,94
来吧，美瞳 这是你最爱的泡沫苏打水，来
Here you go, Bright Eyes. It's your favorite fizzy soda.

62
00:06:05,03 --> 00:06:07,89
我们走吧，东尼 我们应该把她带到楼下了
Come on, let's go, Donnie.

63
00:06:07,99 --> 00:06:10,15
好吗？好姑娘
We should have her downstairs already.

64
00:06:08,32 --> 00:06:10,96
Okay. Good girl!

65
00:06:12,12 --> 00:06:13,11
来吧，姑娘，那就对了
Come on out, girl, that's right.

66
00:06:15,29 --> 00:06:16,82
这是给你的
That's for you.

67
00:06:18,79 --> 00:06:22,20
套脖子上，东尼！套脖子上
Got her!

68
00:06:22,29 --> 00:06:23,53
套脖子上！老天！
Jesus!

69
00:06:26,30 --> 00:06:28,00
东尼，现在！打开！
Donnie, open the cage! Open up! Open up!

70
00:06:28,09 --> 00:06:29,30
东尼！

71
00:06:31,30 --> 00:06:32,29
我要给她打镇静剂
Going to sedate her!

72
00:06:32,60 --> 00:06:35,38
一不不不！ 一门！关门！美瞳！
No, no! - Get the door!

73
00:06:38,31 --> 00:06:39,68
不不不不
No, no! Hold it! Now!

74
00:06:41,35 --> 00:06:43,56
关上，现在就关上！

75
00:06:43,86 --> 00:06:45,47
去找人帮忙，东尼！东尼！快点
Call help! Donnie, Donnie!

76
00:06:45,65 --> 00:06:48,94
112完全没有副作用
There have been absolutely no side effects associated

77
00:06:49,65 --> 00:06:51,14
只有一个例外
with 112, with one exception.

78
00:06:51,24 --> 00:06:54,65
不知道什么原因 黑猩猩的瞳孔有一些绿色的斑点
For some reason,

79
00:06:52,54 --> 00:06:55,66
the chimps irises exhibit flecks of green.

80
00:06:55,41 --> 00:06:57,62
其实，我们先在黑猩猩九号身上注意到
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9,

81
00:06:57,83 --> 00:07:01,49
所有她才有这样的名字，美瞳 我们带她进来的时候你们会看到
hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.

82
00:07:00,76 --> 00:07:02,42
You'll see when we bring her in.

83
00:07:07,13 --> 00:07:08,37
，卜心！
Move!

84
00:07:08,47 --> 00:07:09,75
理论上讲
In theory, this therapy can be used

85
00:07:09,84 --> 00:07:13,80
这个疗程可以用于 大量脑科病症的治疗

86
00:07:11,62 --> 00:07:14,62
to treat a wide range of brain disorders.

87
00:07:19,68 --> 00:07:20,80
用途可以说是无限的
It's virtually limitless.

88
00:07:20,89 --> 00:07:24,48
因此潜在的收益也是 这就是为什么
As are the potential profits.

89
00:07:24,56 --> 00:07:29,10
我们很有信心 你们会投票批准人类的试验
which is why we are confident that

90
00:07:26,66 --> 00:07:29,76
you will vote to approve human trials.

91
00:07:35,95 --> 00:07:36,94
不！不！
No, no, no!

92
00:07:56,35 --> 00:07:59,13
雅各布斯先生？雅各布斯先生，我求你了
Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Jacobs I am begging you,

93
00:07:59,22 --> 00:08:00,81
我求你不要这么做
I am begging you, not to do this.

94
00:08:00,89 --> 00:08:02,43
这会花相当一笔钱
Look, it costs a small fortune to

95
00:08:02,52 --> 00:08:04,51
在所有这些黑猩猩身上操作实验
run lab workups on all of those chimps

96
00:08:04,60 --> 00:08:06,06
只是会告诉我我已经知道的东西
only to tell me what I already know,

97
00:08:06,48 --> 00:08:08,19
那就是它们有传染性
that they are contaminated.

98
00:08:08,27 --> 00:08:09,48
有死亡的危险
There are lives at stake here.

99
00:08:09,57 --> 00:08:13,03
这些动物有个性的 有依恋
These, these are animals with personalities,

100
00:08:11,89 --> 00:08:12,83
with attachments.

101
00:08:14,07 --> 00:08:15,81
一依恋？ 一对
Attachments? - Yeah.

102
00:08:16,57 --> 00:08:19,07
我做的是生意，不是开宠物动物园的
I run a a business, not a petting zoo.

103
00:08:19,95 --> 00:08:22,70
找一个最省钱最有效的方式 让这些猿类安乐死好了
Find the most cost effective way to put those apes down.

104
00:08:22,79 --> 00:08:26,12
一我没法那么做 一你是黑猩猩饲养员，自己想办法
I can't do that.

105
00:08:23,96 --> 00:08:25,50
You're the chimp handler.

106
00:08:25,55 --> 00:08:26,65
Handle it.

107
00:08:27,09 --> 00:08:28,29
史蒂芬？
Steven!

108
00:08:29,13 --> 00:08:31,59
一那太好笑了 一他们拿走了112
Well, that was fun!

109
00:08:31,97 --> 00:08:33,33
董事会拒绝了你的提案
They've taken the 112.

110
00:08:33,43 --> 00:08:35,21
他们选择了推行其他的项目
Board has rejected your proposal.

111
00:08:33,51 --> 00:08:35,26
They've chosen to advance other programs.

112
00:08:35,43 --> 00:08:37,42
呢，一定有你可以做的事情
Well, there must be something that you can do.

113
00:08:37,51 --> 00:08:39,72
对，肯定有的，我可以开除你
Yes. There is, I could fire you.

114
00:08:39,81 --> 00:08:41,51
相信我，我们谈过的
Believe me, we talked about it.

115
00:08:41,60 --> 00:08:43,93
我们有五年的有结论的数据
We have five years of conclusive data.

116
00:08:44,02 --> 00:08:45,35
随你的便，展示所有的数据吧
Parade all the data you want,

117
00:08:45,44 --> 00:08:48,47
你绝对不会说服任何一个人 来投资一分钱
you will never convince anyone to invest another dime.

118
00:08:49,77 --> 00:08:51,98
这种药有潜力来拯救生命
This drug has the potential to save lives!

119
00:08:52,07 --> 00:08:53,60
更像是会让公司破产
Bankrupt this company, more like.

120
00:08:53,99 --> 00:08:57,40
我发誓，关于人类的大脑 你知道一切
I swear, you know everything about the human brain

121
00:08:57,49 --> 00:08:58,95
除了其工作的方式
except the way it works.

122
00:09:03,96 --> 00:09:05,66
回到112的早期计划上
Go back to the drawing board on the 112.

123
00:09:05,75 --> 00:09:08,16
从分子发展重新开始
Start again in molecular development.

124
00:09:08,25 --> 00:09:10,96
在别人搞定之前 先有结果
Find a way to get there before someone else does.

125
00:09:12,88 --> 00:09:14,04
然后把这些混乱清理干净
And, clean up this mess.

126
00:09:31,82 --> 00:09:33,15
富兰克林？
Franklin!

127
00:09:41,70 --> 00:09:43,16
他们怀孕真看不出来
It's very small. She must have been

128
00:09:43,24 --> 00:09:46,41
当他们把她带进来的时候 她肯定已经怀上了
pregnant when we brought her in.

129
00:09:46,50 --> 00:09:47,70
这就是为什么…
So that's why ...

130
00:09:47,87 --> 00:09:48,91
美瞳
She wasn't being aggressive. She was just being protective.

131
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:51,24
她并不是具有攻击性 她只是想保护？

132
00:09:51,34 --> 00:09:52,83
她以为我们要伤害她的宝宝
She thought we were going to hurt her baby.

133
00:09:53,84 --> 00:09:55,33
到这里来

134
00:09:57,43 --> 00:10:00,54
我自己来带他 不过我的小叔子在保安部工作
I would take it myself,

135
00:09:58,41 --> 00:10:02,42
but my brother-in-law works for security. He'd rat me out in a seceond.

136
00:10:00,68 --> 00:10:02,54
他一发现会马上报告我的

137
00:10:04,39 --> 00:10:06,68
什么，你要我带它回家？ 我没法照顾一只猴子
What, you want me to take it home?

138
00:10:05,12 --> 00:10:06,91
I can't take care of a monkey.

139
00:10:07,02 --> 00:10:09,93
一他不是猴子，是猿 一富兰克林，我…
He's not a monkey! He's an ape. - Franklin ...

140
00:10:10,02 --> 00:10:13,26
只是几天而已，直到我找到收容所 我就需要这么多了
You know, it's just for a couple days until

141
00:10:11,21 --> 00:10:12,47
I find a sanctuary.  That's all I need.

142
00:10:13,36 --> 00:10:16,15
富兰克林，不 这不是我的责任
Franklin, no!

143
00:10:14,53 --> 00:10:16,70
Look, this isn't my responsibility.

144
00:10:16,24 --> 00:10:18,02
这是公司的财产
This, this is company property.

145
00:10:21,03 --> 00:10:24,40
好吧，我告诉你吧，博士
Okay ...

146
00:10:22,98 --> 00:10:24,48
I tell you what, Doc.

147
00:10:24,49 --> 00:10:27,11
雅各布斯让我给其他12只实行安乐死

So, what's your secret?

Oh, I can't take any credit. It's in his genes.

00:22:10,03 --> 00:22:11,32
凯撒不会伤害任何人
Caesar will never hurt anyone.

298
00:22:11,95 --> 00:22:13,41
嘿！嘿！

299
00:22:14,16 --> 00:22:16,03
他在这儿很开心，来吧
He's happy here.

300
00:22:16,75 --> 00:22:17,91
对，我看得出来
Yeah, I see that.

301
00:22:20,25 --> 00:22:22,08
我们至少给他点开放的空间吧？
We can at least give him some open space?

302
00:22:22,17 --> 00:22:24,58
对，那可能是个好主意
- Yeah. That would prpbably be a good idea.

303
00:22:28,80 --> 00:22:32,67
我知道桥之后有个地方 红木林，简直是天堂
I know a place right across the bridge,

304
00:22:31,56 --> 00:22:33,67
the Redwoods.  It's a paradise.

305
00:22:48,53 --> 00:22:50,57
来，来
Come on!

306
00:22:51,87 --> 00:22:52,86
到这里来
Come here.

307
00:22:52,95 --> 00:22:55,16
他不需要项圈的 他会乖乖的，来吧
Doesn't need a leash! He'll be fine. Come on!

308
00:22:55,45 --> 00:22:57,07
只是安全起见，来吧
Just to be safe. - Come on, Caesar!

309
00:22:57,16 --> 00:22:58,95
来吧，凯撒

310
00:23:01,46 --> 00:23:02,95
谬尔国家森林公园
It's the redwoods.

311
00:23:03,04 --> 00:23:04,87
这是红木林

312
00:23:13,93 --> 00:23:16,47
凯撒？好吧
Caesar!

313
00:23:15,27 --> 00:23:16,07
All right.

314
00:23:17,52 --> 00:23:20,93
如果我把这个解下 你不能离开我的视野
If I take this off you can not leave my sight.

315
00:23:21,48 --> 00:23:24,47
不然我再也找不到你了，好吧
I'll never find you again.

316
00:23:23,99 --> 00:23:25,38
Okay.

317
00:23:26,90 --> 00:23:29,23
一这是什么？ 一他在做什么？
What's this? - What's he doing?

318
00:23:29,78 --> 00:23:31,14
我真不敢相信
I don't believe that! - What?

319
00:23:31,41 --> 00:23:34,24
一什么？ 一他在请求你的允许
He's asking your permission.

320
00:23:34,83 --> 00:23:36,53
是一个谦卑的手势
It's a supplicating gesture.

321
00:23:37,58 --> 00:23:38,91
可以
It's okay.

322
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:43,54
来吧，凯撒，你可以开跑了！
Come on, Caesar! Off you go!

323
00:23:54,89 --> 00:23:56,42
看他跑的
Look at him go!

324
00:23:57,39 --> 00:23:59,93
一凯撒！ 一凯撒！
Caesar!

325
00:23:59,15 --> 00:24:01,15
Caesar!

326
00:24:02,52 --> 00:24:04,38
一凯撒！ 一凯撒！
Caesar!! - Caesar!!

327
00:24:06,86 --> 00:24:08,02
凯撒！
Caesar!

328
00:24:14,03 --> 00:24:15,52
找到你了
There you are ...

329
00:24:16,91 --> 00:24:18,12
凯撒？
Caesar!

330
00:24:22,04 --> 00:24:23,87
继续，凯撒，爬吧！
Come on, Caesar, climb!

331
00:24:28,42 --> 00:24:29,75
再高点
Go higher!

332
00:24:33,47 --> 00:24:34,63
加油爬！
Climb!

333
00:24:40,72 --> 00:24:42,39
，卜心点
Be careful!

334
00:24:44,77 --> 00:24:46,01
凯撒，小心！
Caesar, be careful!

335
00:25:17,18 --> 00:25:19,54
五年后
FIVE YEARS LATER

336
00:25:37,66 --> 00:25:38,94
晦
Hi!

337
00:25:40,99 --> 00:25:42,90
发生什么了，伙计？
What's going on, buddy?

338
00:25:43,58 --> 00:25:45,44
也给你一些爱
Give some love.

339
00:25:46,79 --> 00:25:48,28
过来，甜心
Come on, honey.

340
00:25:49,04 --> 00:25:50,83
那是只黑猩猩吗？
Is that a chimpanzee?

341
00:25:51,05 --> 00:25:52,13
晦
[dog snarls & barks]

342
00:25:57,47 --> 00:25:58,50
别这样！
Come on!

343
00:26:01,68 --> 00:26:02,92
来吧
Come on!

344
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:06,00
[Caesar snarls back at dog]

345
00:26:06,21 --> 00:26:07,21
[dog whimpers]

346
00:26:08,31 --> 00:26:10,52
凯撒？凯撒
Caesar! ... Caesar!

347
00:26:11,73 --> 00:26:12,97
来
Come on!

348
00:26:13,48 --> 00:26:15,65
没事了，来吧
It's all right. Come on.

349
00:26:19,16 --> 00:26:20,90
没事了，过来
Come on!

350
00:26:25,16 --> 00:26:28,20
我们走吧，上车？
Let's go.

351
00:26:27,25 --> 00:26:30,59
Are you getting in?

352
00:26:30,88 --> 00:26:32,08
凯撒？
Caesar ...

353
00:26:51,27 --> 00:26:52,76
你好么，伙计？
You okay, pal?

354
00:26:56,36 --> 00:26:58,10
你是一只宠物吗？不是
Are you pet? ... No.

355
00:26:57,49 --> 00:27:00,75
You're not a pet.

356
00:26:59,91 --> 00:27:01,11
你不是一只宠物

357
00:27:07,75 --> 00:27:08,86
我是你爸爸
I am your father.

358
00:27:15,13 --> 00:27:16,67
凯撒是什么？
What is Caesar?

359
00:27:19,84 --> 00:27:20,92
好吧
Okay ...

360
00:27:21,09 --> 00:27:22,46
基希斯

361
00:27:28,39 --> 00:27:30,60
凯撒，这是我工作的地方
Caesar, this is where I work.

362
00:27:31,77 --> 00:27:33,73
这是你出生的地方
This is were you were born.

363
00:27:34,44 --> 00:27:37,35
你妈妈曾在这里 和其他的黑猩猩一起
Your mother was here with other chimpanzees.

364
00:27:40,90 --> 00:27:43,07
但是她现在不在这里了
But she's not here, anymore ...

365
00:27:44,45 --> 00:27:45,48
因此
so ...

366
00:27:46,99 --> 00:27:49,86
这就是为什么 我把你带回家和我一起住的原因
... that's why I took home to live with me.

367
00:27:57,25 --> 00:27:58,37
对
Yeah.

368
00:28:00,22 --> 00:28:01,96
你妈妈去世了
Your mother's dead.

369
00:28:04,80 --> 00:28:07,34
原因是，她被施了药
The thing is, she was given medicine,

370
00:28:08,77 --> 00:28:11,26
就像我给查尔斯的药一样
like the medicine I give to Charles.

371
00:28:12,06 --> 00:28:14,02
她把药传给了你
She passed it on to you.

372
00:28:14,86 --> 00:28:16,31
这就是为什么你很聪明
That's why you're so smart.

373
00:28:19,90 --> 00:28:21,64
我们把他带回家吧
Let's take him home.

374
00:28:23,91 --> 00:28:24,99
好的

375
00:28:37,50 --> 00:28:39,96
来，给我解释一下
Come on, explain it to me.

376
00:28:40,46 --> 00:28:41,95
好吧
All right.

377
00:28:42,97 --> 00:28:45,80
我把他偷偷带出实验室 为了救他一命
I snuck him out of the lab to save his life.

378
00:28:45,89 --> 00:28:49,42
我不知道那个药效 直接从他妈妈身上传到了他身上
I had no idea that the effects had been transfered vertically from his mother.

379
00:28:49,81 --> 00:28:53,59
但从此之后 他一直显示出惊人的智商迹象
But, since then, he's been displaying incredible signs intelligence.

380
00:28:53,69 --> 00:28:57,77
我把112设计为修复型 但是凯撒远远超越了这个界限
I designed the 112 to repair, but Caesar's gone way beyond that.

381
00:28:59,15 --> 00:29:01,11
这是他去年的lQ
Here's his IQ from last year.

382
00:29:01,19 --> 00:29:03,15
从那之后，已经翻倍了
Since then, it's doubled.

383
00:29:05,70 --> 00:29:07,06
这不对劲，威尔
This is all wrong.

384
00:29:07,20 --> 00:29:10,41
我父亲离去了 这个药把他救了回来
My father was on gone this drug brought him back.

385
00:29:10,49 --> 00:29:12,16
你从没看到他有多么糟糕
You never saw how bad he was.

386
00:29:12,58 --> 00:29:14,91
一他又一次拥有了生命 一凯撒怎么办？
He has his life again.

387
00:29:13,11 --> 00:29:15,47
And, what about Caesar? - What about him?

388
00:29:15,17 --> 00:29:17,78
一什么他怎么办？ 一他属于哪里？
How does he fit in?

389
00:29:18,84 --> 00:29:19,82
和我一起
With me, ... with us ...

390
00:29:20,88 --> 00:29:21,96
和我们一起
Listen, ...

391
00:29:22,67 --> 00:29:23,71
听着
I know it has been hard for you,

392
00:29:24,47 --> 00:29:26,05
我知道对你而言很难

393
00:29:26,89 --> 00:29:29,38
但是你在尝试控制事态 而那本不该由你控制的
but you are trying to control things that were never meant to be controlled.

394
00:29:29,72 --> 00:29:31,51
112是有效的
The 112 works.

395
00:29:30,47 --> 00:29:32,97
Do you realize how you sound?

396
00:29:32,06 --> 00:29:33,51
你意识到了你说话的语气么？
All I'm saying is this is a good thing.

397
00:29:33,60 --> 00:29:36,09
我所说的就是，这是一件好事

398
00:29:36,19 --> 00:29:39,27
凯撒就是最好的证明，我父亲也是
Caesar's proof of that.

399
00:29:37,69 --> 00:29:39,08
So's my father.

400
00:29:44,19 --> 00:29:45,18
凯撒，吃你的饭
Caesar, eat your food.

401
00:30:11,72 --> 00:30:13,38
爸爸，你还好吗？
Dad, are you okay?

402
00:30:14,22 --> 00:30:15,76
对，我还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

403
00:30:24,78 --> 00:30:26,14
抗体
Antibodies.

404
00:30:26,70 --> 00:30:29,65
他的系统找到了一种打击112病毒的方式
His system has found a way to fight the 112 virus

405
00:30:29,74 --> 00:30:31,86
因此没法输送疗程
so that it can't deliver its therapy.

406
00:30:32,91 --> 00:30:36,45
我父亲的病症会 加倍复发
My father's disease is going to return with a vengence.

407
00:30:45,21 --> 00:30:47,55
甜心，你看到汽车蜡了么？

408
00:30:47,63 --> 00:30:49,09
是木斯堂

409
00:30:55,77 --> 00:30:57,47
看起来不错，我做的就是…

410
00:31:26,00 --> 00:31:27,24
停下！
Stop!

411
00:31:30,55 --> 00:31:31,76
现在给我停下！
Stop, right now!

412
00:31:32,14 --> 00:31:33,42
嘿！嘿！
Hey! Get out there! Get out of that car!

413
00:31:33,60 --> 00:31:36,38
离开那儿！给我从车里出来！

414
00:31:36,81 --> 00:31:38,97
你他妈的在干啥？ 从我车里出来！
What the hell are you doing? Get out of my car!

415
00:31:39,31 --> 00:31:42,43
我说，给我从车里出来！
I said, get out of my car!

416
00:31:43,69 --> 00:31:45,72
我是飞行员！我得去机场！
I'm a pilot! I've got to get to the airport!

417
00:31:45,82 --> 00:31:47,27
现在我怎么去，嗯？
How am I gonna get there now, huh?

418
00:31:47,98 --> 00:31:50,15
你他妈给我答句话啊！ 你在干什么？
Answer the God-damn question! What were you doing?

419
00:31:50,24 --> 00:31:51,40
我有辆车刚…
I have a car just exactly ...

420
00:31:51,91 --> 00:31:52,94
恩，那显然不是…
I'm done ... the police can handle it.

421
00:31:53,03 --> 00:31:54,65
就这样了，我说完了 警察会处理的
Stay right there! You aren't going nowhere, mister!

422
00:31:55,83 --> 00:31:58,49
你就呆在那里！ 你哪儿也不能去，先生！

423
00:31:58,58 --> 00:31:59,91
你或者你儿子得为这个付出代价！
You will pay!

424
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:03,61
但是我保证我他妈绝对不会！ 这是你的问题！你制造了混乱！
This is your problem, you make it happen!

425
00:32:06,92 --> 00:32:08,33
一我烦死你们俩了！ 一我不会…
... not through with you! Stay right there!

426
00:32:08,42 --> 00:32:10,00
你就呆在那里！

427
00:32:11,26 --> 00:32:12,50
不！

428
00:32:48,38 --> 00:32:49,66
不！

429
00:32:50,38 --> 00:32:51,92
不！不！

430
00:32:53,93 --> 00:32:55,42
凯撒！停下！
Caesar, stop!

431
00:32:57,18 --> 00:32:58,39
爸爸！
Daddy!

432
00:33:03,98 --> 00:33:05,34
不不

433
00:33:07,73 --> 00:33:08,89
凯撒！
Caesar!

434
00:33:19,87 --> 00:33:21,20
好了
It's okay.

435
00:33:23,04 --> 00:33:25,25
好了，你不是有意的
It's okay.

436
00:33:23,33 --> 00:33:25,20
He didn't mean it.

437
00:33:26,75 --> 00:33:28,12
没事了
It's okay ...

438
00:33:51,65 --> 00:33:54,31
嘿，把那东西从他身上解开
Hey, hey, take that thing off of him!

439
00:33:55,65 --> 00:33:57,94
你可以把那个从他身上解开吗？ 来吧
Take that thing off of him!

440
00:33:58,03 --> 00:33:59,82
我会带他进去，好吗？
Look, I'll take him in, okay?

441
00:33:59,91 --> 00:34:01,99
不，他现在属于法庭监管 你不能那么做
No, he's under court orders. We can't do that.

442
00:34:02,08 --> 00:34:03,57
那可以的，让他那么做吧
It's fine! Let him.

443
00:34:04,87 --> 00:34:05,86
你准备好了就带他进来
Bring him in when you're ready.

444
00:34:06,16 --> 00:34:08,53
一把那个取下 一谢谢
Take it off.

445
00:34:08,30 --> 00:34:09,57
Thank you!

446
00:34:09,83 --> 00:34:12,12
凯撒，凯撒，凯撒，凯撒？凯撒
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar, ... Caesar, Caesar.

447
00:34:13,84 --> 00:34:15,95
现在不要这样，会没事的
Not right now. It's going to be okay.

448
00:34:16,38 --> 00:34:18,29
我们就看看里面有什么，好吗？
Let's just see what it's like inside, okay.

449
00:34:20,26 --> 00:34:22,30
来吧凯撒，我们走
Come on, Caesar.

450
00:34:22,22 --> 00:34:22,94
Let's go.

451
00:34:23,85 --> 00:34:25,76
圣布鲁诺 灵长类收容所

452
00:34:26,39 --> 00:34:28,73
来吧，相信我
Come on, ... trust me.

453
00:34:44,49 --> 00:34:45,83
没事的
It's okay.

454
00:34:48,83 --> 00:34:49,82
去吧
Go.

455
00:34:57,72 --> 00:35:00,67
他没有和其他黑猩猩一起玩过
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.

456
00:35:01,34 --> 00:35:02,68
我们已经习惯了
Oh, we're used to that.

457
00:35:02,97 --> 00:35:06,01
刚开始他会有点害羞怕怕 但是我们会让他融入的
He'll be a little skittish at first, but we'll integrate him.

458
00:35:09,89 --> 00:35:11,89
你会很惊奇他们适应得那么快
You'd be surprised how quick they adapt.

459
00:35:12,86 --> 00:35:15,02
我们提供一个激发性的环境
We provide a stimulating environment.

460
00:35:15,82 --> 00:35:17,85
他在这里会进步很快的
He's going to thrive here.

461
00:35:18,19 --> 00:35:19,90
来吧，我们有些文书要签
Come, let's do some paperwork.

462
00:35:19,99 --> 00:35:23,20
你进来时确保锁上门
Make sure you lock that door when you come in.

463
00:35:46,85 --> 00:35:48,05
凯撒
Caesar!

464
00:35:49,06 --> 00:35:50,97
一切都会好的
You'll be okay!

465
00:35:52,19 --> 00:35:53,77
一切都会好的
Everything's going to be okay!

466
00:35:55,52 --> 00:35:56,93
不要害怕
Don't be scared.

467
00:35:57,03 --> 00:35:59,23
现在你要呆在这里
You're going to stay here, now.

468
00:36:02,07 --> 00:36:03,15
不
No ... Not going home right now.

469
00:36:04,41 --> 00:36:06,15
现在我们不回家

470
00:36:06,24 --> 00:36:07,57
没事的
It's OK.

471
00:36:08,37 --> 00:36:11,66
根据我们的经验而言 告别的时间越长
The longer you drag out the good-byes,

472
00:36:11,75 --> 00:36:13,70
就越艰难
the harder it is.

473
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:16,08
我可以稍后签吗？
Can I sign that later?

474
00:36:17,67 --> 00:36:20,71
你很可能会想念他 比他想念你更多
You'll probably miss him more than he'll miss you.

475
00:36:20,80 --> 00:36:22,76
最好给他几周时间 来适应这个地方
You'd best give him a couple of weeks to get used too the place.

476
00:36:22,84 --> 00:36:24,58
威尔，我们得走了
Will, we have to go.

477
00:36:26,01 --> 00:36:27,67
我们得回家了
We have to go home.

478
00:36:27,76 --> 00:36:29,76
我很快就会回来，好吗？
Coming back soon, okay?

479
00:36:35,86 --> 00:36:38,10
在你回来前打个电话
Just call ahead, before you do.

480
00:36:42,28 --> 00:36:43,81
嘿，过来！
Hey, over here!

481
00:36:45,82 --> 00:36:47,74
嘿，我可以把你弄出去！
Hey, I can get you out!

482
00:36:51,45 --> 00:36:53,79
来，过来
Come on!  Over here!

483
00:37:07,51 --> 00:37:09,55
来，嘿，下来
Hey, down here.

484
00:37:22,78 --> 00:37:24,27
傻冒的猴子
Stupid monkey ...

485
00:37:45,88 --> 00:37:49,72
你就只能这么做吗？喂！ 这是个疯人院！
So you? Come on, make it!

486
00:37:49,80 --> 00:37:51,72
这是个疯人院！

487
00:37:58,52 --> 00:38:01,10
法院的传讯还没有送出 所以不在系统里
Court order hasn't been filed, so it's not in the system.

488
00:38:01,19 --> 00:38:03,02
一旦通过了 会花大约90天
Once it comes through,

489
00:38:03,11 --> 00:38:04,35
你才能收到上诉日期
it will take about 90 days before you receive an appeal date.

490
00:38:04,53 --> 00:38:06,27
一90天？ 一对，先生，90天
90 days? - Yes, sir, 90 days.

491
00:38:06,36 --> 00:38:08,35
一你会收到邮件通知 一等一下
You'll be notified by mail.

492
00:38:09,24 --> 00:38:11,86
好吧，事情会这么发生 你会回到电脑前
Here's what's going to happen.

493
00:38:11,95 --> 00:38:13,66
你最好把事情调整好
You're going to go back to your computer, you know, shift things around

494
00:38:13,75 --> 00:38:16,41
这周你就得给我一个上诉的日期 你明白了么？
and you're going to get me a date for my appeal, this week, you got it?

495
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:18,20
我没法帮助你
I can't help you.

496
00:38:18,71 --> 00:38:21,25
好吧，那我们问题就大了 因为除非你这么做，否则我不会离开的
All right, then we have a problem.

497
00:38:20,19 --> 00:38:21,88
Because, I'm not moving until you do.

498
00:38:22,38 --> 00:38:23,87
90天，先生
90 days, sir. Be thankful you're talking about court dates.

499
00:38:23,96 --> 00:38:26,45
你有个法庭日期已经不错了，要感恩

500
00:38:26,55 --> 00:38:28,71
你很幸运他们没有让所有的动物安乐死
You're lucky they didn't put that animal down.

501
00:38:31,55 --> 00:38:34,09
我保证我会很快接他回来，爸爸
I promised to get him back soon, Dad.

502
00:38:36,56 --> 00:38:37,59
爸爸？
Dad?

503
00:38:44,11 --> 00:38:47,90
我父亲的免疫系统一直抵御112病毒
My father's immune system continues to reject the 112 virus,

504
00:38:47,99 --> 00:38:50,52
让基因疗程完全无效
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.

505
00:38:50,91 --> 00:38:55,90
他的健康日渐恶化 疾病蔓延很迅速
his health is deteriorating, and the disease is progressing rapidly.

506
00:38:57,41 --> 00:38:59,50
我需要一个更具攻击力的病毒应变
I need a more aggressive virus strain,

507
00:38:59,58 --> 00:39:01,57
更快速的传递方式
a faster delivery method,

508
00:39:02,75 --> 00:39:04,62
因为以这个效率…
because at this rate ...

509
00:39:13,14 --> 00:39:14,30
我不能同时失去他们两个
I can't lose them both.

510
00:39:19,89 --> 00:39:21,76
我不会失去他们两个
I won't lose them both.

511
00:39:24,77 --> 00:39:26,31
晦，我们能谈谈吗？
Hi .... Can we talk?

512
00:39:26,53 --> 00:39:28,94
1央点，我有个会要开
Make it fast.  I've got a meeting.

513
00:39:30,28 --> 00:39:31,90
10年来你一直在运营基希斯
The ten years you have been running GEN-SYS,

514
00:39:32,70 --> 00:39:34,24
开发了多少药物
how many drugs have come down the pipeline that could save millions of lives?

515
00:39:34,33 --> 00:39:36,28
可以拯救成千上万的生命

516
00:39:36,62 --> 00:39:38,78
可以改变一切？
That could change everything?

517
00:39:38,87 --> 00:39:40,66
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

518
00:39:40,75 --> 00:39:42,45
那个ALZ一112
The ALZ-112.

519
00:39:44,29 --> 00:39:46,50
威尔，你怎么了？
What happened to you, Will?

520
00:39:46,59 --> 00:39:48,62
你曾经是这个实验室的明星
You used to be the star of this lab. Now, you hardly ever show

521
00:39:48,72 --> 00:39:50,88
现在你几乎不出现 而且当你现身时

522
00:39:50,97 --> 00:39:54,55
你浪费时间 你的团队纠结在一种药上
and when you do, you waste your time and that of your team's

523
00:39:52,30 --> 00:39:54,19
fixating on a drug

524
00:39:54,64 --> 00:39:57,25
在那事儿发生之后 这种药绝对不会通过的
that, after what happened, is never ever going to get approved.

525
00:39:57,64 --> 00:40:00,68
112太危险了，威尔 不会成功的
The 112 is dangerous, Will,

526
00:39:59,34 --> 00:40:00,73
and it doesn't work.

527
00:40:00,94 --> 00:40:03,80
我用它来治疗我父亲 有效的
I treated my father with it.

528
00:40:03,24 --> 00:40:04,32
It does work.

529
00:40:06,77 --> 00:40:09,06
你用了什么？你干了什么？
You did, what?

530
00:40:09,15 --> 00:40:11,31
他打败了疾病，就像我们预言那样
You did, what!?

531
00:40:09,12 --> 00:40:11,30
Beat the disease, like we predicted.

532
00:40:11,40 --> 00:40:13,74
一带他进来 一有一个并发症
Brilliant.

533
00:40:12,01 --> 00:40:13,55
There's been a complication.

534
00:40:13,82 --> 00:40:15,11
恩，这有效的，不是么？
Well, does it work or doesn't it?

535
00:40:15,33 --> 00:40:17,69
我父亲的病最后还是盖过了疗程
My father's disease eventually outran the cure.

536
00:40:17,79 --> 00:40:19,20
我的老天
Oh, for goodness sake.

537
00:40:19,29 --> 00:40:22,87
他的免疫系统创造了抗体 抵御了病毒成分
The immune system produced antibodies to beat the viral component,

538
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:24,16
但是一定会成功的
but it will work.

539
00:40:24,25 --> 00:40:28,58
我已经开发了一种病毒变体 我想会更具攻击性
I've have already developed a virus strain

540
00:40:26,60 --> 00:40:28,57
that I think will be more aggressive.

541
00:40:28,67 --> 00:40:30,16
你这么认为么？
You think?

542
00:40:30,26 --> 00:40:32,00
就让我测试一下吧
Just, let me test it.

543
00:40:32,97 --> 00:40:34,83
你在浪费我的时间
You're wasting my time.

544
00:40:35,22 --> 00:40:36,46
还有更多的
There's more!

545
00:40:38,43 --> 00:40:41,26
这个应用超越了疾病本身
The applications go beyond the disease.

546
00:40:41,35 --> 00:40:42,47
有迹象显示
There are indications that show the therapy can improve cognitive functioning,

547
00:40:42,56 --> 00:40:46,43
疗程可以提高认知功能，记忆质量…

548
00:40:46,52 --> 00:40:48,73

memory quality ...

549
00:40:46,54 --> 00:40:48,80
What, what are you saying?

550
00:40:49,44 --> 00:40:52,90

My father didn't just recover.

551
00:40:51,62 --> 00:40:52,67
He improved.

552
00:40:53,95 --> 00:40:55,23

You mean, increased intelligence?

553
00:40:56,12 --> 00:40:57,65

It's not conclusive, but yes.

554
00:40:59,79 --> 00:41:05,12

I want you, to start testing the revised 112 on chimps, A-S-A-P.

555
00:41:05,21 --> 00:41:07,67

Okay.

556
00:41:06,16 --> 00:41:08,16
I'll give you whatever you need, but get started.

557
00:41:07,75 --> 00:41:09,12


558
00:41:13,22 --> 00:41:14,80

Dinner time!

559
00:41:26,77 --> 00:41:28,56

Great Ape, primate!

560
00:41:30,78 --> 00:41:31,98

Go on, don't you know food when you see it?

561
00:41:32,44 --> 00:41:34,35
你看到了不知道那是食物吗？

562
00:41:46,42 --> 00:41:47,41
你觉得那好笑吗？
You think that's funny, huh?

563
00:41:50,09 --> 00:41:51,95
我给你看看什么叫好笑
I show you something funny!

564
00:42:05,60 --> 00:42:07,39
很快他就知道谁是老大了
You'll learn who's boss, soon enough.

565
00:42:09,69 --> 00:42:11,85
一他的衣服怎么办？ 一什么怎么办？
What about his clothes?

566
00:42:11,94 --> 00:42:12,93
我不知道
What about 'em?

567
00:42:11,92 --> 00:42:16,50
I don't know ... May cause problems with the other apes.

568
00:42:13,69 --> 00:42:16,61
会给其他猿类带来麻烦

569
00:42:18,53 --> 00:42:19,61
好吧
Good!

570
00:43:18,22 --> 00:43:21,96
寄送到： 基希斯

571
00:43:22,85 --> 00:43:24,59
我数了10只猿类，对吗？
I counted ten apes, correct?

572
00:43:24,68 --> 00:43:25,84
对
Yep.

573
00:43:26,10 --> 00:43:27,34
好，一直到后面
Good.  All the way to the back.

574
00:43:27,43 --> 00:43:28,51
好

575
00:43:31,02 --> 00:43:34,01
你们都进展很快 为什么这么赶？
You guys are moving really quick on this. What's the big rush?

576
00:43:34,11 --> 00:43:35,97
回想第一天，你还在抱怨
First day back, you're still complaining.

577
00:43:52,04 --> 00:43:54,20
可巴，晦，我是威尔
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

578
00:44:04,26 --> 00:44:05,84
好，这个
This one.

579
00:44:06,43 --> 00:44:08,67
他很安静
He's very calm.

580
00:44:08,77 --> 00:44:10,76
对，这家伙去了很多实验室 见惯不惊了
Yeah.

581
00:44:08,22 --> 00:44:11,78
He's been through a whole lot of labs. He knows the drill.

582
00:44:10,85 --> 00:44:12,59
他知道训练流程

583
00:44:14,15 --> 00:44:15,48
我想我可以加入你们
Could I join you, what's our progress.

584
00:44:15,65 --> 00:44:17,39
看我们的进展

585
00:44:18,23 --> 00:44:19,94
让他准备好
Get him prepped.

586
00:44:24,78 --> 00:44:26,32
戴紧你的面具
Tighten your masks.

587
00:44:26,41 --> 00:44:28,24
递给我113
Pass me the 113.

588
00:44:29,37 --> 00:44:31,58
血氧指数不错，血压稳定
Pulse-ox is good, blood pressure is steady.

589
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:39,04
输送到位
Perisol delivery, in place.

590
00:44:44,43 --> 00:44:45,92
释放113
Releasing the 113.

591
00:45:02,87 --> 00:45:04,70
We have a break!

592
00:45:05,11 --> 00:45:06,60
富兰克林，戴上你的面具！
Franklin, get your mask on!

593
00:45:09,58 --> 00:45:11,24
一好了？ 一对
Got it?

594
00:45:11,58 --> 00:45:12,69
拴紧皮带
Yeah.

595
00:45:12,79 --> 00:45:13,99
你还好吗？
You okay?

596
00:45:14,46 --> 00:45:15,79
恩，还好
Yeah, okay.

597
00:45:19,63 --> 00:45:20,62
火箭

598
00:45:22,47 --> 00:45:24,13
1央走！我们走吧！
Move it!  Let's go!

599
00:45:24,93 --> 00:45:27,54
起来运动运动，你个懒骨头！
Get up and do some exercises you lazy baboons!

600
00:45:52,70 --> 00:45:55,07

602
00:48:11,13 --> 00:48:14,42
智商结果令人惊讶 毫无倒退迹象
Intelligence results are remarkable.

603
00:48:12,92 --> 00:48:14,07
There are no adverse effects.

604
00:48:14,51 --> 00:48:16,59
猿类的免疫系统真是超级强大
Apes have amazingly strong immune systems.

605
00:48:16,68 --> 00:48:19,34
对，好了，好好观察
All right, keep an eye on him.

606
00:48:19,43 --> 00:48:20,64
好的
Okay. [Franklin sneezes]

607
00:48:21,77 --> 00:48:22,93
关于那个很抱歉
Sorry about that.

608
00:48:23,56 --> 00:48:26,30
这些家伙比我更灵活
These guys are more resiliant than I am.

609
00:48:29,36 --> 00:48:30,98
抱歉等一下
Excuse me a second.

610
00:48:42,58 --> 00:48:44,04
零下86度冰柜

611
00:49:02,23 --> 00:49:05,31
伤得很重吗？
You seriously injured?

612
00:49:06,27 --> 00:49:09,57
Do you know sign language?

613
00:49:08,36 --> 00:49:10,27
你知道手语吗？

614
00:49:11,36 --> 00:49:13,98
马戏团猩猩
I worked at the circus.

615
00:49:25,17 --> 00:49:26,50
他很好
He's good.

616
00:49:29,55 --> 00:49:33,38
小心点，人类和聪明的猿类可不同
Be Careful. Humans do not like intelligent apes.

617
00:49:38,39 --> 00:49:40,05
寄送到：基希斯 “幸运”

618
00:49:40,68 --> 00:49:42,80
我要你今晚工作到很晚
You're working late tonight.

619
00:49:42,89 --> 00:49:45,13
基希斯还需要三份
GEN-SYS needs three more.

620
00:50:05,96 --> 00:50:08,41
嘿，嘿嘿！

621
00:50:10,75 --> 00:50:13,75
一嘿 一嘿，凯撒，你好
Hey, Caesar!

622
00:50:13,84 --> 00:50:15,30
你受伤了吗？
Are you hurt?

623
00:50:16,59 --> 00:50:18,08
你受伤了吗？

624
00:50:18,47 --> 00:50:19,71
给我看看
Show me.

625
00:50:23,27 --> 00:50:25,26
凯撒，把手递给我
Caesar, give me your hand. Give me your hand.

626
00:50:25,60 --> 00:50:27,01
把手递给我，没事的

627
00:50:27,10 --> 00:50:29,22
有时候新来的孩子会被欺负
Sometimes, the new kid on the block gets picked on.

628
00:50:29,31 --> 00:50:32,10
别担心 天啊，他们对你做了什么？
Stay calm. What did they do?

629
00:50:33,19 --> 00:50:35,18
胡说，你到底做了什么？
That's bullshit!

630
00:50:35,28 --> 00:50:38,19
一放手 一嘿！这儿有什么问题？
What's the problem here?

631
00:50:40,32 --> 00:50:42,24
我要把他带出这里，现在
I'm taking him out of here, right now.

632
00:50:42,33 --> 00:50:44,86
如果没有法定命令，你不可以
Not without a court order, you're not.

633
00:50:44,95 --> 00:50:46,69
他不再是你的了
He's not yours, anymore.

634
00:50:46,79 --> 00:50:50,16
我保证 如果我发现他被虐待，任何方式
I promise, if I find out he's been mistreated in any way,

635
00:50:50,25 --> 00:50:52,24
我会让这鬼地方关门
I'll have this place shut down.

636
00:50:54,21 --> 00:50:55,37
继续
Go on ...

637
00:50:56,01 --> 00:50:57,79
嘿，你好

638
00:50:59,84 --> 00:51:00,96
嘿

639
00:51:03,97 --> 00:51:04,96
不
No.  No, we're not going home, right now.

640
00:51:06,14 --> 00:51:07,47
不，现在我们不回家

641
00:51:08,24 --> 00:51:12,88
I'm going to get you out of here, I promise.

642
00:51:09,81 --> 00:51:12,14
但是我会带你离开这里 我保证

643
00:51:14,98 --> 00:51:15,97
你得相信我
You have to trust me.

644
00:51:16,82 --> 00:51:19,06
凯撒，你得相信我，好吗？
Caesar, you have to trust me, okay?

645
00:51:19,15 --> 00:51:21,24
我想访问结束了
I think this visit's over.

646
00:51:21,62 --> 00:51:24,28
相信我，会好的
Trust me.

647
00:51:22,98 --> 00:51:24,93
You'll be okay.

648
00:52:08,25 --> 00:52:10,53
来吧！走，我们走吧！
Come on, move it! Let's go!

649
00:52:57,80 --> 00:52:59,50
哇！有上百只
There are hundreds of them! Looks like you're own private zoo!

650
00:52:59,59 --> 00:53:01,33
这就像你自己的私人动物园

651
00:53:01,42 --> 00:53:02,75
更像是这些毛毛家伙的监狱
Rather like a prison for hairy dudes.

652
00:53:04,09 --> 00:53:05,58
他们看电视吗？
They watch TV?

653
00:53:05,80 --> 00:53:07,67
我们称之为丰富生活
We call it enrichment.

654
00:53:10,14 --> 00:53:12,10
这只太可爱了！
Aw, this one's so cute!

655
00:53:12,98 --> 00:53:14,59
他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

656
00:53:16,02 --> 00:53:18,64
名字是科纳利亚，是母的
Uh, name's Cornelia. It's a she.

657
00:53:18,47 --> 00:53:19,13
[shreek]

658
00:53:20,28 --> 00:53:21,77
一哦，我的天！ 一别靠太近
Oh, my God!

659
00:53:21,86 --> 00:53:23,52
这只把我吓得半死
Don't get too close!

660
00:53:21,99 --> 00:53:23,91
This one scared me half to death.

661
00:53:23,61 --> 00:53:25,73
对，那个大家伙叫毛里斯
That big guy is called, Maurice.

662
00:53:26,28 --> 00:53:27,49
不好玩
It's no fun.

663
00:53:28,16 --> 00:53:30,62
来，我给你看看什么叫好玩
Here, I'll show you something fun.

664
00:53:34,50 --> 00:53:36,03
看看这个
Check this out!

665
00:53:39,21 --> 00:53:40,83
你疯了吗？
It's crazy!

666
00:53:42,17 --> 00:53:43,91
你不应该来的
You shouldn't be in here.

667
00:53:44,01 --> 00:53:45,34
嘿，你是下一个！
Hey, you're next!

668
00:53:52,14 --> 00:53:54,01
来吧，我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

669
00:53:54,10 --> 00:53:56,31
我在这儿花了很多时间
We spent too much time in here, as it is.

670
00:53:58,40 --> 00:53:59,43
来吧
Come on!

671
00:53:59,52 --> 00:54:01,26
看看这个家伙
Check out this guy.

672
00:54:01,53 --> 00:54:03,23
嘿，那只真是个大麻烦
Hey, Alan, he's a pain in the ass. He thinks he's special, or something

673
00:54:03,32 --> 00:54:04,31
他觉得他很特别

674
00:54:06,66 --> 00:54:07,82
真奇怪
Freaky!

675
00:54:08,82 --> 00:54:10,28
嘿，到这儿来
Hey, come here.

676
00:54:11,62 --> 00:54:12,95
就像他在想什么似的…
I think he's thinking or something.

677
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:16,91
哦，我的天！他掐住了他的喉咙！
Oh, my God, he's got him by the throat!

678
00:54:17,17 --> 00:54:18,37
一放开他！ 一放手！
Let him go!

679
00:54:18,17 --> 00:54:19,61
Let go!

680
00:54:21,42 --> 00:54:23,41
一你还好吗？ 一我还行
Are you okay?

681
00:54:24,38 --> 00:54:26,42
我告诉你了别太靠近的
Yes.

682
00:54:24,32 --> 00:54:26,50
I told you not to get too close, man.

683
00:54:26,51 --> 00:54:28,34
来吧，伙计们，我们离开这里
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

684
00:58:55,36 --> 00:58:58,52
朱立斯凯撒

685
00:59:15,01 --> 00:59:16,09
嘿

686
00:59:17,72 --> 00:59:20,42
有些事情不该改变的
Some things aren't meant be changed.

687
00:59:21,14 --> 00:59:23,13
你需要接受那个
You need to accept that.

688
00:59:26,93 --> 00:59:28,51
嘿！
Hey!

689
00:59:28,60 --> 00:59:31,47
嘿！这里发生什么了？
Hey!

690
00:59:31,56 --> 00:59:33,05
更多113的实验，我们刚准备了…
What's going on here?

691
00:59:33,15 --> 00:59:35,81
不，我们得先分析可巴的血样
More 113 trials. We're just prepping ...

692
00:59:33,57 --> 00:59:36,14
Oh, no, we have to analyze Koba's blood work first!

693
00:59:35,94 --> 00:59:36,98
富兰克林知道这的，他在哪儿？
Franklin knows this. Where is he?

694
00:59:37,53 --> 00:59:39,48
他请了两天病假
He's out sick for two days.

695
00:59:39,57 --> 00:59:41,23
我没有同意这个
Well, I didn't authorized this.

696
00:59:41,32 --> 00:59:43,15
不
No!

697
00:59:43,24 --> 00:59:44,40
我同意了
I did.

698
00:59:44,74 --> 00:59:46,90
我们同意就同一主体分开测试
We agreed to test sparingly on one subject.

699
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:49,41
那个主体真是让人惊奇
And, that one subject is stunning!

700
00:59:49,79 --> 00:59:52,62
是一种病毒 我们不知道和人类相关的影响
It's a virus. We don't know the human related effects.

701
00:59:52,71 --> 00:59:55,95
那种药很成功，威尔 告诉他，琳达
The drug works, Will.

702
00:59:56,05 --> 00:59:59,41
一开始，可巴在卢卡斯塔游戏上 得了完美的15分
Tell him, Linda.

703
00:59:56,05 --> 00:59:58,89
For starters, Koba scored a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

704
00:59:59,51 --> 01:00:01,54
每个测试结果都证实了其有效性
Every test result verifies its effectiveness.

705
01:00:01,64 --> 01:00:03,17
一不要再测试了 一你是说…
No more tests. - What are you ...?

706
01:00:03,26 --> 01:00:05,42
直到我们更清楚了解这个 我们不会再进一步测试
Not until we have a better understanding of what we're dealing with.

707
01:00:05,51 --> 01:00:08,47
喂，我要告诉你我们正… 嘿，给我们一点时间
Look, I'll tell you exactly what we do. Look ...

708
01:00:08,56 --> 01:00:10,97
抱歉，把猿放回笼子里 温柔点
Give us a minute.

709
01:00:08,78 --> 01:00:11,38
Excuse me!   Put the ape back in the cage. Be gentle.

710
01:00:11,06 --> 01:00:14,77
威尔，我要告诉你我们正在操作的事情
Will, I'll tell you exactly what we're dealing with, here.

711
01:00:14,86 --> 01:00:15,81
我们搞的是一种药
We're dealing with a drug that is worth more

712
01:00:15,90 --> 01:00:19,98
比我们开发的其他药加起来 的总和还要有价值
than everything else we are developing, combined.

713
01:00:20,49 --> 01:00:24,28
你创造了历史，我挣了钱 那不是我们的安排么？
You make history,

714
01:00:22,16 --> 01:00:23,52
I make money.

715
01:00:24,37 --> 01:00:25,78
不，有风险
Isn't that our arrangement? - No! There are risks.

716
01:00:25,87 --> 01:00:27,82
别和我谈什么风险不风险的
Don't you tell me about risks.

717
01:00:27,91 --> 01:00:31,32
你给了你自己的父亲 一种尚在实验的药
You give your own father an experimental drug.

718
01:00:31,41 --> 01:00:33,70
我只消一个电话 就可以毁掉你的职业生涯
I could finish your career with one phone call.

719
01:00:33,79 --> 01:00:36,25
我会帮你省掉这麻烦的，我辞职
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.

720
01:00:37,38 --> 01:00:39,54
没有你我们会照样继续的
We will proceed without you.

721
01:00:41,55 --> 01:00:44,13
你不知道你在做什么
Look ... You do not know what you're doing.

722
01:00:44,22 --> 01:00:45,68
这些测试需要小规模监管
These tests need to be contained.

723
01:00:45,76 --> 01:00:50,51
你根本不知道113是否稳定 它对人们可能造成什么样的伤害
You have no idea if the 113 is stable,

724
01:00:48,36 --> 01:00:50,90
what kind of damage it can do to people ...

725
01:00:50,60 --> 01:00:53,59
是的，这就是为什么 我们在黑猩猩身上做实验
Well, that is why we test it on chimps, ... isn't it?

726
01:00:54,73 --> 01:00:55,72
不是么？

727
01:00:57,44 --> 01:00:59,98
罗德曼博士，是我，富兰克林！ 我需要和你谈谈！
Dr. Rodman, it's, me, Franklin! I need to talk to you!

728
01:01:00,07 --> 01:01:02,06
你可以到门前来吗？
Can you come to the door?

729
01:01:15,25 --> 01:01:16,49
博士？
Doc! [coughing]

730
01:01:16,59 --> 01:01:18,45
你是谁啊？
Who the hell are you? [Franklin sneezes on neighbor]

731
01:01:22,42 --> 01:01:23,96
给我滚！
Get out of here!

732
01:01:24,05 --> 01:01:25,84
抱歉，抱歉
I'm sorry, ... I'm sorry.

733
01:01:42,11 --> 01:01:43,98
你不会要陷害我吧？
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me, would you?

734
01:01:48,12 --> 01:01:51,11
呢，我不能说我同意
Well, ... I can't say that I approve.

735
01:01:52,66 --> 01:01:53,95
他们不是人类，你知道
They're not people, you know.

736
01:01:54,37 --> 01:01:55,74
你会让他走还是不让？
You gonna to let him go or not?

737
01:02:09,51 --> 01:02:11,84
凯撒？嘿，过来
Caesar, ... hey, come on.

738
01:02:13,35 --> 01:02:14,81
来吧，我们回家
Come on, we're go home.

739
01:02:17,48 --> 01:02:18,59
回家
Home.

740
01:02:19,77 --> 01:02:20,93
来，我们真的回去了
Come on, we're really going.

741
01:02:22,19 --> 01:02:24,81
来吧，我们离开这里

742
01:02:25,03 --> 01:02:26,80
Let's get out of here.

743
01:02:33,83 --> 01:02:34,91
对
Yeah ... Come on.

744
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:36,99
