00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,848
Am I walking too rapidly,
reverend lady?

334
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,391
What's that

A gift, dear friend.

351
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,897
You know, the Chinese find
the juice of the tomatoes
Ithe only suitable antidote

352
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,481
for the aromas of skunk,

00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,487
I'm going to beat you
like a red-headed stepchild.

I'm going to beat you
like a red-headed stepchild.

But why? I saved your life.

359
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:43,493
I took you
to the Red Society,

360
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:45,538
I took you
to the Red Society,

an organization with, uh,
with an ironic sense of humor.

an organization with, uh,
with an ironic sense of humor.

363
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,044
Had I delivered you
to the Green Society,

364
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,129
they would have
slit your throat.

365

370
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,355
My dear friend,
Wu Ch'En She has no sons.

371
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:13,523
So then why am I
looking for him?

372
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:14,984
So then why am I
looking for him?

373
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:27,454
Every damn word
out of your mouth hasld
been a lie, hasn't it?y.

374
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,791
I can explain.

375
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:31,541
Yeah. There isn't
any brave little boy

No, there isn't.
No, there isn't.

380
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,510
A missionary lying!

381
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,553
It's like pissing
all over God's uniform.

382
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:44,096
It's like pissing
all over God's uniform.

383
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,974
If I had told you the truth,
you never would have agreed
to help us.

384
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,559
Mr. Wasey,
at this very moment,
tens of thousands ofat?

385
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,313
Mr. Wasey,
at this very moment,
tens of thousands ofat?

courageous soldiers are
suffering agonizing pain

387
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,442
courageous soldiers are
suffering agonizing pain

388
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,695
And not one of them is
related to Wu Ch'En She.

389
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,571
Oh, hold the phone.
The Walter Faraday?

390
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,741
Oh, hold the phone.
The Walter Faraday?

391
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,577
Well, anyway, they say
Wu stole 1,100 pounds ofaday,
opium from this Mr. Faraday.?

392
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:07,578
Well, anyway, they say
Wu stole 1,100 pounds ofaday,
opium from this Mr. Faraday.?

393
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:09,788
You're looking for
Faraday's flowers.

394
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:12,541
You've heard of them?

395
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,583
I've also heard of El Dorado
and the Lost Dutchman Mine.

396
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,919
I've also heard of El Dorado
and the Lost Dutchman Mine.

397
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:17,880
They don't exist either.
You're crazy, you know that?

398
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:19,589
Do you know what they did
to Walter Faraday? Do you?

399
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:20,591
Do you know what they did
to Walter Faraday? Do you?

400
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:22,134
Answer me, damn it!

401
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,053
I can't.

402
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:25,595
You smell so bad
I can't think straight.

403
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:27,014
You smell so bad
I can't think straight.

404
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:29,266
After they shot him,
drowned him and burnt him,

405
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:31,268
they say he was
fished out of the river,

406
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:31,601
skinned and deboned,
then hung up

407
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,270
skinned and deboned,
then hung up

408
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:35,314
for everybody to see
on the Lower Nanking Road.

409
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,607
That's only hearsay.

410
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:38,776
That's only hearsay.

411
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,862
Maybe so.
But if they'll do that
to an Opium King,

412
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:43,613
to the Glow-in-the-dark
Tie King?

413
00:24:43,613 --> 00:24:44,198
to the Glow-in-the-dark
Tie King?

414
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:47,034
What about your ties?
What about 'em?

415
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,619
Mr. Burns has them
stored at the mission.

416
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:53,499
Mr. Burns has them
stored at the mission.

417
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:19,649
Oh, dear. I sense

00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,945
I'm afraid he knows.

420
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,947
No point in apologies, pal.

421
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:25,655
I just want my stuff.

422
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:26,740
I just want my stuff.

423
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:31,162
You must think we're lunatics.

424
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:37,209
Lunatics?
You're worse than lunatics.

425
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:37,667
Two missionaries
and a Glow-in-the-dark
tie salesman

Two missionaries
and a Glow-in-the-dark

427
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:43,673
do not just
stroll up to people

428
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:44,800
do not just
stroll up to people

429
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:47,678
and ask if they've seen
1,000 pounds of opium
lying around.

430
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,679
This time
they threw us in the fish.

431
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:49,972
This time
they threw us in the fish.

432
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:52,099
Next time we get grinded
into cat food.

433
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:55,186
He's right, you know.

434
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:55,685
I'm afraid we've been
hopelessly irresponsible.

435
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:58,063
I'm afraid we've been
hopelessly irresponsible.

436
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:10,910
Perhaps this will
make up A ticket?

437
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,579
I paid your fare
to Los Angeles.

438
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:17,041
Your captain will
welcome you back
with open arms.

439

Your ship sails
the day after tomorrow.

440
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:19,709
I booked a room for you
in the Hotel Penang.

I booked a room for you
in the Hotel Penang.

442
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:23,923
It's plain but adequate.

443
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,715
And, uh,
here's a small contribution...

444
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:26,884

No. No, I don't.

450
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:49,281
Well, we can't have you
leaving Shanghai without
tasting the duck.

451
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:49,739
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

453
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:01,751
I hope you're not offended,
Mr. Wasey, but that new tie
is a major improvement..

I hope you're not offended,
Mr. Wasey, but that new tie
is a major improvement..

455
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:07,757
It's a little subdued for me.
Boy, this place looks great.

It's a little subdued for me.
Boy, this place looks great.

00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:10,594
Oh, we're not eating here.

458
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:13,013
I've got something
more elegant in mind.

Mr. Wasey?

462
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:19,769
I've never been here before.
I couldn't afford it
till I met you.

Well, like you, Mr. Wasey,

476
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:55,805
Beat it.

477

481
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:06,317
Don't be silly.
You have a following of
your own there, Tatlock.

You're not Phil at all,
are you?

Mr. Tuttle,
this is my friend, Mr. Wasey.

487

Mr. Tuttle is
a distinguished journalist.

488

He's also
the foremost authority

on Walter Faraday in Shanghai.

491
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,084
Oh, well, what a coincidence.

492
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,835
Could this possibly
be the reason

493
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:27,922
Could this possibly
be the reason

494
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:30,716
we're dining in this
charming establishment?

495
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:31,841
Tell him, Willie.
Tell him the flowers
really do exist.

Tell him, Willie.
Tell him the flowers
really do exist.

00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:51,359
China Doll said
you have a pretty face

829
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,531
China Doll said
you have a pretty face

830
00:53:53,656 --> 00:53:56,158
and I should tell you
all I know about
Faraday's flowers.

831
00:53:56,283 --> 00:53:57,365
Okay.

832
00:53:57,365 --> 00:53:58,285
Okay.

833
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,121
About a year ago Joe Go
put up big down payment

834
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:03,371
so Wu Ch'en She
can deliver five crates
of super Grade A opium.

835
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:05,042
so Wu Ch'en She
can deliver five crates
of super Grade A opium.

836
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,795
Only crates turn
into five loads of
super grade A bricks

837
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,377
and one small ball
of Faraday's opium.

838
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:10,714
and one small ball
of Faraday's opium.

839
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,134
Someone pulled a switch.
Wu Ch'En She?

840
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:14,802
Definitely not Wu.

841
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:15,383
Joe Go have Yamagani San
beat Wu to a pulp.

842
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:17,680
Joe Go have Yamagani San
beat Wu to a pulp.

843
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,724
No, if someone
make the switch,

844
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:21,389
Joe Go bet on Faraday.

845
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:22,935
Joe Go bet on Faraday.

846
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,480
What was that?

847
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:27,395
Very hot item.

848
00:54:27,395 --> 00:54:28,816
Very hot item.

849
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:32,111
Joe Go call it
Shanghai Surprise.

850
00:54:33,362 --> 00:54:33,401
See. Stockpiling's
hell of a damn good business.

851
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:36,574
See. Stockpiling's
hell of a damn good business.

852
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:39,407
Look.

853
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:43,289
Look.

854
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:45,413
Do you think
the flowers still exist?er,

855
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:47,835
Do you think
the flowers still exist?er,

856
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,419
Joe Go ask himself,
"If flowers don't exist,
why does Wu still exist?"

857
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:51,881
Joe Go ask himself,
"If flowers don't exist,
why does Wu still exist?"

858
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:53,090
You mean he's really alive?

859
00:54:53,215 --> 00:54:54,925
Could we speak to him?

860
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,425
Tell you what,
Joe Go out his down payment.

861
00:54:57,425 --> 00:54:57,678
Tell you what,
Joe Go out his down payment.

862
00:54:58,637 --> 00:55:00,473
You want to speak to Wu?

863
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,224
You take Joe Go
off the hook. Okay?

864
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:03,431
Okay.

865
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:04,059
Okay.

866
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:05,186
Let's see.

867
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:07,938
I have, uh, $38.

868
00:55:08,063 --> 00:55:09,437
Sister, $38 may
get you ten cartons of
Lucky Strike Greens,

869
00:55:09,437 --> 00:55:10,941
Sister, $38 may
get you ten cartons of
Lucky Strike Greens,

870
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:13,194
but Joe Go is in hole
for 12,000 big ones.

871
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:45,473
I might Jo Go know fastball,
worth mocurveball, change-up,

872
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:45,684
I might Jo Go know fastball,
worth mocurveball, change-up,

873
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,853
even the elusive screwball.

874
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,272
But what the hell was
this wondrous pitch?

875
00:55:58,906 --> 00:56:00,658
Ah, yes. Word of this magic
A has come to Joe Go's ears.

876
00:56:02,701 --> 00:56:03,491
After you bring us
to Wu Ch'En She.

877
00:56:03,491 --> 00:56:04,829
After you bring us
to Wu Ch'En She.

878
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:31,021
I'd stay here if I were you.

879
00:56:31,147 --> 00:56:32,523
Don't be silly.

880
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:33,521
This could be
the end of our search.

881
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:34,859
This could be
the end of our search.

882
00:56:36,152 --> 00:56:37,194
Okay, let's go.

883
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:38,779
(MAN COUGHING)

884
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:34,960
Hey!
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)ANDAHey!

885
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:38,714
Give me my purse back!

886
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,510
(TATLOCGlen!EAMING)

887
00:57:42,635 --> 00:57:44,094
(ALL CLAMORING)

888
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,137
Glen!

889
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:39,233
WheWho did this to you? Who?

890
00:58:49,243 --> 00:58:51,659
I'm not sure, but I think
it means "The last phoenix."
(Whatever that is.)

891
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:52,955
I'm not sure, but I think
it means "The last phoenix."
(Whatever that is.)

892
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,749
What puzzles me is
why you were tortured.

893
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,665
It's just that,
since the occupation,

894
00:58:57,665 --> 00:58:59,086
It's just that,
since the occupation,

895
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:02,715
the police have stopped
torturing people except for
purely political reasons.

896
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,671
That makes sense.

897
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:04,758
That makes sense.

898
00:59:04,884 --> 00:59:06,010
I mean, this guy stopped
stretching my neck

899
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:08,137
the minute I mentioned opium.

900
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:09,677
Sadistic no-hands bastard.

901
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:12,141
Sadistic no-hands bastard.

902
00:59:19,982 --> 00:59:21,689
No hands? Are you certain?

903
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:22,443
No hands? Are you certain?

904
00:59:22,568 --> 00:59:24,570
Well, it's pretty hard
to make a mistake
about a thing like that.

905
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,490
I saw a Chinese officer
called Mei Gan

906
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:27,695
have his hands blown off
the night Walter was killed.

907
00:59:27,695 --> 00:59:30,159
have his hands blown off
the night Walter was killed.

908
00:59:30,284 --> 00:59:32,912
Like everyone else,
I've always thought

909
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:33,701
that the bad blood
between those two
had to do with the opium.

910
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:36,123
that the bad blood
between those two
had to do with the opium.

911
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:37,833
But looking back
on the meticulous way

912
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,707
he searched that money belt,

913
00:59:39,707 --> 00:59:45,713
he searched that money belt,

914
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:47,802
he searched that money belt,

915
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:51,305
it's entirely possible
the dispute between them
haHis name was also Mei Gan.e.

916
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:55,976
You know everything,
don't you, Kronk?
I beg your pardon?

917
00:59:56,101 --> 00:59:56,977
Yeah, you know
when the police
want to see me,

918
00:59:57,102 --> 00:59:57,725
you know
where to get insurance,
you know who is who.

919
00:59:57,725 --> 00:59:59,980
you know
where to get insurance,
you know who is who.

920
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:01,982
You probably know
how many damn freckles
I have on my ass!

921
01:00:02,107 --> 01:00:03,731

What's the matter with you?

922
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:05,236
Glendon!
What's the matter with you?

923
01:00:05,986 --> 01:00:09,737
I mean, who is this guy?
What does he want?th me.

924
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:12,910
I mean, who is this guy?
What does he want?th me.

925
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:15,743
I should be happy
to answer you, Mr. Wasey.

I should be happy
to answer you, Mr. Wasey.

927
01:00:16,664 --> 01:00:20,543
I have no doubt whatsoever
that you will accomplish
your task.

928
01:00:20,668 --> 01:00:21,749
I am just as certain
that in some small way

929
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:23,337
I am just as certain
that in some small way

930
01:00:23,462 --> 01:00:25,714
I will help you
achieve your goal.

931
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,755
And if I am correct,
I expect to be rewarded.

932
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:30,010
And if I am correct,
I expect to be rewarded.

933
01:00:30,136 --> 01:00:31,887

Mr. Tuttle here

934
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:33,761
expects fair payment
for services rendered.

for services rendered.

01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:36,684
After all, dear boy,

937
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:39,103

introduced you
to China Doll.

941
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,000
I wish you'd give up
this opium businesst of here.

942
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,791
and just go back
to saving souls.

and just go back
to saving souls.

944

What did old Hookah Head
have to say, huh?

957
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:45,833
Well, he blinked a few times,
blew a few smoke rings

958
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:48,839

Oh, Joe Go
very, very sorry
about bump on head.

981

But just pretend
it was wild pitch.

982

Okey-dokey.

983
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:57,905

of the line for me.

of the line for me.

leave tomorrow?

986

I better take this taxi.

989
01:03:39,825 --> 01:03:39,947
do you ever wonder about
what might have happened
if we had met someplace else?

990

what might have happened
if we had met someplace else?

Thank Burns for me,

Thank Burns for me,

998

For what?

999

For the intro.

1000
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:06,310
For the intro.

1001
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,230
If it hadn't been for him,
we never would have met
in a millioWait.rs.

1002

Good evening, Mr. Wasey.

1021
01:05:17,089 --> 01:05:18,757
We regret the necessity
for the hostile behavior,

1022
01:05:18,883 --> 01:05:22,049
but we didn't feel
you'd receive us

I'm so sorry.
I really do abhor these
nasty little things.

You better keep it on me

1028
01:05:30,853 --> 01:05:33,397
After dinner...
We went to
Mr. Tuttle's newspaper

1029
01:05:33,522 --> 01:05:34,061
and looked up Mei Gan
in the morgue.

1030
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:35,608
and looked up Mei Gan
in the morgue.

1031
01:05:42,364 --> 01:05:45,284
WASEY:
That's the son-of-a-bitch
before he lost his hands.

1032
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:46,073
But...
But look at the headline
on that clipping.

01:05:46,073 --> 01:05:47,703

But look at the headline

1034
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:52,079
"Did This Man
Loot the Royal Tombs?"

1035
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,296
"Did This Man

1036
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:08,766
It would appear that Mei Gan

1037
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:10,097
My dear departed friend,
Walter Faraday.

1038
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:11,185
My dear departed friend,
Walter Faraday.

1039
01:06:15,815 --> 01:06:16,103
They say the last phoenix
scratched at
the emperor's grave.

1040
01:06:16,103 --> 01:06:18,943
They say the last phoenix
scratched at
the emperor's grave.

1041
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:21,070
So, if Mei Gan
also robbed graves,

1042
01:06:21,195 --> 01:06:22,109
that would be why Wu'd
call him the last phoenix.

1043
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:23,906
that would be why Wu'd
call him the last phoenix.

1044
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:27,618
And one of the graves
he plunderedd.

1045
01:06:27,743 --> 01:06:28,115
was the tomb
of the Empress Tzu Hsi.

1046
01:06:28,115 --> 01:06:29,995
was the tomb
of the Empress Tzu Hsi.

1047

The Empress Tzu Hsi
was also known by her

1050
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:45,594
Boys, I owe you a dinner.

1051

(DOOR OPENS)

1052
01:06:53,435 --> 01:06:56,772
WASEY: I have come
to ask something
only Yehonala would know.

1053
01:06:56,897 --> 01:06:58,145
What treasures
did the warlord Mei Gan
plunder from your tomb?

1054
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:00,693
What treasures
did the warlord Mei Gan
plunder from your tomb?

1055
01:07:00,818 --> 01:07:04,029
Do you think
I would reveal to you
what I have told no one else

1056
01:07:04,155 --> 01:07:06,949
merely because you resemble
someone I once cared for?

1057
01:07:07,074 --> 01:07:10,157
Not at all. I'm hoping
you'd tell me

1058
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:12,288
Not at all. I'm hoping
you'd tell me

so that I can

The buds, rubies.

The buds, rubies.

1063
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:49,074
The leaves, diamonds.

1064
01:07:49,783 --> 01:07:50,993
Faraday's flowers.

1065
01:07:51,118 --> 01:07:52,199
Yehonala's flowers.

1066
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:52,870
Yehonala's flowers.

1067
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,082
Faraday stole them
from Mei Gan.

1068
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,296
Walter was persuaded
to retrieve from a thief

1069
01:08:07,802 --> 01:08:08,552
what always belonged
to Yehonala.All right.

1070
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:13,808
I'll tell my friends only
that the opium does not exist.

1071
01:08:15,184 --> 01:08:16,223
Yehonala has done me
a great service.

1072
01:08:16,223 --> 01:08:17,812
Yehonala has done me
a great service.

1073
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:19,730
She also makes me very sad.

1074
01:08:20,356 --> 01:08:21,857
Why sad, Wasey?

1075
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:28,235
He'll stop at nothing
to get back what
Faraday took from him.

1076
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:30,032
He'll stop at nothing
to get back what
Faraday took from him.

1077
01:08:30,157 --> 01:08:32,201
He'll come after you.

1078
01:08:32,326 --> 01:08:34,078
Mei Gan came to me
a year ago,

1079
01:09:06,235 --> 01:09:08,654
(SPEAKING MANDARIN).

1080
01:09:32,052 --> 01:09:34,301
You've been a most
resourceful young man. Okay.

1081
01:09:34,301 --> 01:09:34,555
You've been a most
resourceful young man. Okay.

1082
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,683
I commend you.

1083
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:40,307
Look, whatever
you want to know,
I'll tell you.

1084
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:42,354
Look, whatever
you want to know,
I'll tell you.

1085
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,773
You've not only
mastered the enigma
of Chinese mythology,

1086
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:46,313
I suspect you've also
solved the mystery
of the Heavenly Gardens.

1087
01:09:46,313 --> 01:09:48,611
I suspect you've also
solved the mystery
of the Heavenly Gardens.

1088
01:09:48,736 --> 01:09:51,822
Look, it was opium
I was after, not jewels.

1089
01:09:51,947 --> 01:09:52,319
4:00 this afternoon,
I'm on my way
back to Los Angeles.

1090
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,325
4:00 this afternoon,
I'm on my way
back to Los Angeles.

1091
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,535
Oh. How do you
intend to travel?

1092
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,325
By steamship
or burlap sack?

1093
01:09:58,325 --> 01:09:58,787
By steamship
or burlap sack?

1094
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:04,251
You've got
to be kidding.

1095
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:05,961
I assure you
if your answer
is burlap sack,

1096
01:10:06,086 --> 01:10:07,671
Steamship, of course.

1097
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:09,840
Good. Then you are
free to embark

1098
01:10:11,008 --> 01:10:13,677
the moment you return
the Heavenly Gardens to me.

1099
01:10:15,012 --> 01:10:16,343
You know who has them.
Why can't you just get them?

1100
01:10:16,343 --> 01:10:17,515
You know who has them.
Why can't you just get them?

1101
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,435
Because the lady is immune
to my methods of persuasion.

1102
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,349
So what makes you think
I'm going to be
more successful?

1103
01:10:22,349 --> 01:10:22,978
So what makes you think
I'm going to be
more successful?

1104
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:24,688
I mean, she's crazy.

1112

Mr. Burns, those jewels
can buy more opium
than we've ever dreamed of.

1113

Mr. Burns, those jewels

I must ask your friend
a question, Wasey.

1128

You say you wish
to help my country.

1129
01:12:33,234 --> 01:12:34,481
Why should my jewels be used
to buy the opium drug

Why should my jewels be used
