00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,083
Hey. Hey, maybeyou know her.

163
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,750
A little girl.A Puerto Rican.

164
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,375
Come on, suck it!I said suck it!

165
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,083
- About 5'2". Blue eye shadow.- Man, I'm trying toget off here.

166
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,250
I'm not stopping you.I just want to talk to her.

167
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,291
I don't want her talkingwhile she's giving me head.

168
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,166
( screams )Jesus.

169
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,583
- ( spits )- She's not giving youdiddly, man.

170
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,625
We're just--forget it, okay?!

171
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,583
- ( laughs )- Don't flatter yourself.

172
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,500
I wouldn't wastemy come on you.

173
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,917
Tricks. They're sopredicable, you know?

174
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,875
You get in the carand you're his.

175
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,709
( horn honks )

176
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,542
And never get in a van.

177
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
I made that mistake once.

178
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,125
( man whistles )

179
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,959
Just once.

180
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,542
It happened downtowna couple of years ago.

181
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:35,375
It was before I had a pimpto take care of me.

182
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,291
I guess my mind just wasn'ton my job that night.

183
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,875
Man: Excuse me, miss.

184
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,041
You're a prostitute,aren't you?

185
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,667
No. I'm a wet dreamon legs.

186
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,291
How-- how muchdo you cost?

187
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,166
What are you looking for?

188
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,542
I don't know.Something around $20.

189
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,291
20 bucks won't buya porno tape.

190
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,750
Double itand I'll give you head.

191
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,333
I give great head.

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,709
All right. All right.Get in.

193
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,208
So you got a placeor you want it here?

194
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:49,083
- ( screaming )- Yeah!

195
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,875
Come on, man!Give her a good fucking for me!

196
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,041
Fuck her up the ass! Yeah!

197
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,208
Come on, man!Do it for me, man!

198
00:09:56,208 --> 00:10:00,125
Stick it down herfucking throat, man! Whoo!

199
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,458
Liz: There must have been five of 'em.

200
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,125
They started on me right away. They were like animals.

201
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,667
Just grunting and laughing. Grunting and cussing.

202
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,458
- Yeah, come on, man!- ( screaming continues )

203
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,709
Liz: Seem to go on forever. I don't know how long.

204
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,375
When they had enough, they-- they just got rid of me.

205
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,583
- Man: Later, bitch! - ( door shuts )

206
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,417
( whimpering )

207
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,083
My God.

208
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,458
Don't be afraid.

209
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:21,083
Liz: Yeah, he offered me a ride to the nearest hospital.

210
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,792
I really should've gone,

211
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,625
but the hospital would've called the cops

212
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,125
and I couldn't deal with the cops.

213
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,625
So I told him I had a fight with my boyfriend

214
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,542
and maybe he could just take me home.

215
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,125
Then he told me he was a schoolteacher.

216
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,125
Great, with my luck, he'll molest me.

217
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,583
He gave me his handkerchief to wipe away the blood.

218
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,834
The only thing he wanted

219
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,625
was to know if I needed anything.

220
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,125
I hated asking,

221
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,500
but I needed some money.

222
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,375
He gave me 20 bucks, his name, and his address.

223
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,875
I guess he thought he'd never see it again,

224
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,333
but I sent it back with a new handkerchief

225
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,500
and I wrote him this little thank-you note.

226
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
"Just a line to let you know that I'm okay."

227
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,250
But he never wrote back.

228
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,834
One look at my spelling would scare anybody off.

229
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,041
Especially a schoolteacher, you know?

230
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,500
( air rhythmically rushing )

231
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,583
Looks a little flat.

232
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,542
Need a hand pumping it up?

233
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,208
You are doing it

234
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,917
without a rubber thing?

235
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,166
I pay for itwithout a rubber thing.

236
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,709
You prefer whatwithout a rubber thing?

237
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,041
- Everything.- What are you, man,like suicidal?

238
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,250
Yes. I amliking that, too.

239
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,375
Well, I'm not intosuicides and I always usea rubber thing.

240
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,250
- I pay extra.- You couldn't afford extra.

241
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,458
( siren blaring )

242
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,750
He wants it,but he doesn't wantto use a rubber.

243
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,250
Get a lot of men like that.

244
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,291
I mean, they'll pay extra.Sometimes even double.

245
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,875
I mean,that is really stupid.

246
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,792
What if they tooksomething home to their wives?

247
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,250
Some of 'em never give up, do they?

248
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,250
Take Charlie for instance.

249
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,125
Man was as good as gold.

250
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,417
Charlie was a regular, but he didn't want sex.

251
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,667
Well, not straight sex anyway.

252
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,417
All I had to do was hit him with his cane and he'd come.

253
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,875
First time, I got a little carried away.

254
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,750
Bam. Oops.

255
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,250
Then I found out just how hard he liked it.

256
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,625
It's funny. The first time I saw him all stretched out on the bed

257
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,000
with his skinny little chicken legs and his wrinkled little butt,

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,917
I mean, I practically peed my pants.

259
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,333
Just six swats. That was all he needed.

260
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,250
Easy money.

261
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,125
I must have a talent for it.

262
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,041
I should open up a torture chamber.

263
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,250
I make him beg for mercy.

264
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,792
There was this one day, right,

265
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,333
his grandchildren were there.

266
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,291
He told them I was from the welfare department.

267
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,125
That he had to show me around the house.

268
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,625
We left the kids watching TV and we went upstairs.

269
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,583
We couldn't do it in the bedroom 'cause the lock was broke.

270
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,500
So we did it in the bathroom,

271
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,208
but I couldn't get a good swing.

272
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,792
It was just too narrow.

273
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,250
- ( glass shatters ) - ( Liz laughs )

274
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,625
I broke a fucking light fixture.

275
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,959
He was so sweet. He always gave me something.

276
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,709
I mean, you know, besides the money.

277
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,792
Usually something from the garden.

278
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,417
I know it's stupid to get involved with tricks,

279
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,125
but he's, well, he's a client.

280
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,375
And sometimes, you've gotta break the rules.

281
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,500
Last year, Charlie had a stroke.

282
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,500
Give me your hands,Donatello.

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,083

286
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,583
Okay, so he's in a rest home now.

287
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,583
Don't mean he has to rest.

288
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,500
Charlie's still my client.

289
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,041
I always bring him an avocado.

290
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,000
He thinks it's from his garden.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hey, what he don't know won't hurt him.

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,375
But I think he probably knows.

299
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,542
- Mosquito.- What do you want now,a dollar for slapping me?

300
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:48,625
No, no problem.

301
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,000
- No problem, sister.- Thanks, mon,

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,125
but next time,I think I'll justlet him suck my blood.

303
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,792
But it was free.( laughs )

304
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,792
- Free.- Shit.

305
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,000
( horn honks )

306
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,750
Whoo!

307
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,166
Bad move.

308
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,834
Even tricks need a little bitof mystery, AIDS carrier.

309
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,083
She's a fucking strawberry.

310
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,291
Won't accept cash,only crack.

311
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
And you see,prostitutes like that,

312
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,625
they have no respectfor themselves.

313
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,125
I mean, I would never pull outone of my breasts in public.

314
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,500
I would never go outwith a bodysuit on.

315
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,625
I mean, just a bodysuit.

316
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,542
And I would neveropen my legs on the street.

317
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,875
I mean, I would never donone of that shit.

318
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,041
And I don'twear shorts, either.

319
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,375
Well, I wear shorts,

320
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,500
but I don't wear themup the crack of my ass,you know?

321
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,667
And I only wear 'emduring the day.

322
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,792
I mean,when I was younger,

323
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,792
I used to do shit like that,I guess. I don't know.

324
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:05,625
Seems the older I get,the more mature I get, I guess.

325
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,041
Goddamnmotherfucking shit.

326
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,625
- ( tires screech )- ( horn honks )

327
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,834
( tires screech )

328
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,250
( music playing )

329
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,208
Give me a dry martini,please.

330
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,375
Very dry with a cherry.

331
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,041
Not an olive.

332
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,208
( panting )

333
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,125
He doesn't really thinkI'm gonna leave him.

334
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,333
Hey, I know what he thinks.

335
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,500
He thinks I'm stillgonna work.

336
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,000
Like I said,I left my place yesterday,

337
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,709
I went and got thislittle motel room.

338
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,208
And see,what he thinks is

339
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,208
is that I've beenstacking my money, right?

340
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,667
And in a couple of days,

341
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,041
I'm gonna have thisbig bankroll for him.

342
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,750
( scoffs )

343
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,083
That's what he thinks,but I'm not.

344
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,125
No. Not this time.

345
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,667
I've been spending my money.

346
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,917
Oh.

347
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,000
Look at my nails.

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,083
I used to havebeautiful nails.

349
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,583
Now I can't leave them alone.

350
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,250
I'm like a dog with a bone.

351
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,709
See, pimps, you know,

352
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:29,583
they think that they gotthis hold on you, you know?

353
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,542
Like you'll stick to themlike fucking crazy glue.

354
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,500
And it is kinda crazy,you know?

355
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,625
In some sort of sick,twisted way, they...

356
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,208
they make you believethat you love 'em.

357
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,291
I knew Blake about a year

358
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,250
and he never asked me out or even laid a hand on me.

359
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,125
It wasn't that I wanted him to.

360
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,041
It was that I wondered why he hadn't.

361
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,417
So naturally, when he sent me a classy dress

362
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,291
and showed up at my place in a tux

363
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,000
with pine freshener on his breath,

364
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,333
I wondered what the fuck was up.

365
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,834
Um, hey.

366
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,917
Do you think we could sitat a different table?

367
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:19,000
I mean, I got thisproblem with kitchens.

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,375
I used to work at thisgreasy spoon, you know,

369
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,250
and it was justcrawling with roaches.

370
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,333
Ahem. Well,it's your night.

371
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,792
I understand, ma'am.Please, follow me.

372
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,291
Oh, but I didn't mean

373
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,041
your kitchen was crawlingwith roaches, too.

374
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,417
It's just that I get this,what do you call it?

375
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:39,417
A phobia about it.Yeah, that's it.

376
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,375
Liz: I felt kinda nervous.

377
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,375
You know, like you do when you're out with your boss or something.

378
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,250
I didn't think I could be promoted

379
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,542
and I wondered if a whore could be fired.

380
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,458
But then he never would've used breath freshener

381
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,250
and bought me that classy new dress, would he?

382
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,291
So now you gonna tell mewhat the occasion is?

383
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,875
So what do you want to eat?

384
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
( sighs )

385
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,083
A steak.I'm so hungry,I could eat a horse.

386
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,750
10-1 it is one, huh?

387
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,792
Steak "tarter."

388
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah, this is a nice place,

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,375
but you'd think they'd knowhow to spell steak, huh?

390
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,208
- S-T-E-K-E--- This is a French restaurant.

391
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,208
Then how come there's noFrench fries on the menu, huh?

392
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,792
They call 'em pommes frites.

393
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,959
Oh.

394
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,792
Well, I'll havea helping of that

395
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,166
and a nice, juicy steak.

396
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,500
Steak tartareis raw steak

397
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,583
minced withraw onions, eggs,

398
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,250
and Worcestershire sauce.

399
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,834
Oh. Really?

400
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:56,250
Well, why don't you makea suggestion, then, huh?

401
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,083
All right.

402
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,333
As a starter,how 'bout gravlax marinade?

403
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,250
What's that?

404
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,792
It's raw salmonand it's marinade--

405
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,291
Raw?Is everything inthis restaurant raw?

406
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,500
I mean, can't they afforda chef around here?

407
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,625
Hey, raw foodis really good for you.Don't you know nothin'?

408
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,834
( speaks French )

409
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,625
He wants youto choose.

410
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,750
( laughs )

411
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,542
What, you foundsomething?

412
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,208
What's so funny aboutcrab julienne?

413
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,500
You remember.Your old whore Julienne.

414
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,583
She had crabslike you wouldn't believe.

415
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,709
- You remember.- Uh, yes, madam?

416
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,458
- I don't really know, sir.- Hey, call him waiter.

417
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,125
You call me sir.

418
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll orderfor both of us.

419
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,750
Très bien, sir.

420
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,250
We'll have the calamara la chinoise.

421
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,125
And would sir care for some wine?

422
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,625
Hey, can we getsome champagne?

423
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,875
I haven't had champagnefor a long time.

424
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,917
Give me a bottleof "Low Da Vici."Very cold.

425
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:04,583
I presume sir means "Eau De Vichy."

426
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, that's what I said.

427
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:10,417
So now you gonna tell mewhat this is all about?

428
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,792
Madamhas a request?

429
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,667
I have an extensiverepertoire.

430
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,667
Uh, how 'bout "Don't ItMake My Brown Eyes Blue"?

431
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,667
I'm afraidI'm not that familiar withthe contemporary classics.

432
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,583
- Of course not.- How 'bout the marchfrom act three

433
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,333
of Wagner's"Lohengrin"?

434
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,250
I think you meanact two.

435
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,417
I was wondering when wewere gonna get together,

436
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:50,667
- but is this likea proposal or something?- "Something," my ass.

437
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,542
Don't say you didn'tremember our anniversary.

438
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,208
I've been lookingafter you a year now.

439
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,625
A year this very day.

440
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,875
- C'est bon, sir?- You may pour.

441
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,375
- To our anniversary.- And the oldest profession.

442
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,208
- The what?- Ahem.

443
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,208
Uh, prostitution

444
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,291
is commonly knownas the oldest profession.

445
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,083
It sure makes me feel old.I'll drink to that.

446
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,583
This tastesexactly like water.

447
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,041
It's sparkling mineral water. It's good for the liver.

448
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,875
You oughta lay off the booze.It's got a lot of calories.

449
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,250
- No, put it out.- Hmm?

450
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,250
We're in a nonsmoking area.Put it out.

451
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,250
Well, why don't we moveto a smoking area, then?

452
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,750
You wanna take care of yourself?Smoking is bad for your health.

453
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,750
So is fuckingscabby tricks.

454
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,750
And what is this?

455
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,583
It's calamari and lychees.What's it look like?

456
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,250
I don't know,but I've seen onebefore, I think.

457
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,834
What is calamar?

458
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,250
It's a kind of octopus,you stupid moron.

459
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,917
It's fucking octopus.

460
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,500
Ha! I should've known.They got testicles, don't they?

461
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,625
Though I thought theyhad eight of 'em. Looks likeyou've been shortchanged.

462
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,458
Looks like a dick.

463
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,125
( spits )Tastes like a dick.

464
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,458
Look, all I want is just

465
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,959
an old-fashioned pieceof apple pie with loadsof ice cream on it!

466
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,834
- Yeah, well, forget it!- What-- what you say?!

467
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,458
What, have you gone deaf?I said forget it!

468
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,166
You're as fatas a fucking pig!

469
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:30,208
( scoffs )

470
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,834
I'm-- I am?

471
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,750
Liz: I guess he was right.

472
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,959
I smoke too much, eat junk food, and drink like a fish.

473
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,834
I mean, I gotta get some satisfaction out of life

474
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,875
or it just ain't worth living.

475
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:48,000
Whoring ain't exactly the job of the future, you know.

476
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,959
And working out, doing 50 sit-ups

477
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,667
when I could have been sleeping wasn't my idea of fun.

478
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,959
Well, it had its moments, I guess.

479
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,709
♪ Tell me ♪

480
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,583

484
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,417
Our first year together as pimp and whore

485
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,667
and Blake's idea of an anniversary gift...

486
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,542
You're gonna seea big change in yourself.

487
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:36,083
Psychologically.

488
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,125
Physically,

489
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,417
you're gonna bea lot more body conscious.

490
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,834
Great. Does that meanI'm gonna lose my stomach?

491
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:46,625
Tattoo artist: You'll be a lot more committed to self.

492
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,375
And to the one you love,

493
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,709
you'll have a special,spiritual connection

494
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:54,667
because tattoos are forever.

495
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,291
So are diamonds,but they're a lot less painful.

496
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,625
That's the most pricksI've had in 30 minutes.

497
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,250
Liz: For a while, he was right.

498
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,291
I felt kinda special.

499
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,875
Till one by one I found out

500
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,166
all of Blake's girls had one.

501
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,083
Hey, not always on the same body part.

502
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,083
I wasn't special.

503
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:22,750
I was just a piece of branded cattle. One of the herd.

504
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,917
You see, what pimps do

505
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,250
is they build you up and then they break you down.

506
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,583
It's kinda likebeing a hostage.

507
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,750
They just know howto make you need 'em.

508
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,291
They don't love you.

509
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,166
Pimps don't love nobody.

510
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,083
Give me another martini,please.

511
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,667
Air dry.

512
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,166
Getting as bad as Bill was.

513
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,667
Fuck it.

514
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,458
The minute I laid eyes on him,

515
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,542
I thought he was real cute.

516
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,166
It was back home at the local dive

517
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,917
where they had music and beer

518
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,333
and you could hang out and shoot pool.

519
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,625
Like I did with my friend Martha.

520
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,417
It was back in the days when I was living the straight life.

521
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,917
- I feel like I'm gonna die.- Put your bet on him.

522
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,792
- Think I should?- What's a buck?Yeah, you're right.

523
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,792
But don't you thinkit will look kinda weird,me going over there

524
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,792
and putting money downright in front of him?

525
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,625
No, he'll just thinkyou're some horny bar slut

526
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:24,792
- that wants to fuck him.- Stop.

527
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,583
What if I wantto marry him?

528
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,875
Then I thinkI better bet on him.

529

551
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,500
We really loved each other.

552
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,709
The way when you're a little girl

553
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,375
and imagine how love would feel.

554
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,917
The way your mom always told you love should be.

555
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,166
So I thought getting married

556
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,417
was the best thing that ever happened to me.

557
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:28,500
I guess it was too good to last.

558
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,709
Well, that was one thing my mom didn't tell me.

Liz: Well, I guess playing house

563
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,166
is sorta fun when you're seven years old.

564
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:52,417
But when you're seven months pregnant, well, forget it.

565
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,417
I mean, when he starts getting home later and later,

566
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:58,583
drunker and drunker 'cause of all the overtime he's putting in,

567
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:02,583
when you know he's been fired and he's been cheating on you.

568
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,792
Well, that'd be tough on any relationship.

569
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,917
Still, I couldn't stop loving the bastard.

570
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:11,125
So I kept on trying to please him.

571
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:14,041
Getting all dolled up for dinner and setting the table pretty

and making his favorite salad.

573
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,333
All I really wanted was a good night's sleep.

574
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,375
And you never knew how he was gonna react.

575
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,500
It was like living on the edge of a fucking volcano.

576

00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:47,333
Shut up.

579
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,583
Chrissy.

580
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,583
Shh. Come on, baby.

581
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,709
We're gonna go see Grandma.

582
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,667
Let's get out of this dump.

583
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,667
Woman on TV:I want my daughter.

584
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,667
I'm not an alcoholic.Give me Karen.

585
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,458
Man on TV:Take it off, then.

00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:05,875
Woman: Give memy daughter, please.

587
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,000
Man: Yeah, this iswhat you want.

588
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,583
- No.- This is what it's about,huh, Bambi?

589
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,542
I want my daughter.

590
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,542
Liz: Finally, I get it through my head.

591
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,792
Okay, I married a loser. No great loss.

592
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,667
A lot of people do it.

593
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,208
So I leave Bill and I move in with my mom.

594
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,750
Then I get this dream job at a sleazy diner.

595
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,375
One night it was late, I was tired, and the tips were shit.

596
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,834
I just worked a double shift when this guy walks in.

597
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,500
It was like he walked into the wrong restaurant.

598
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,834
What's onthe menu tonight?

599
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:41,250
Chef Pierre is goneand we're closingin five minutes.

600
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,166
I can offer you a pieceof cantaloupe, though.

601
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:46,208
- How's your cantaloupe?- Ripe.

602
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,250
Is that what you wanted?

603
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,667
- How 'bout a drink instead?- Sorry, we don't serve--

604
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,959
What do you say I take yousomewhere that does?

605
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:55,250
What, me?You mean...

606
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,250
I'm not muchof a drinker.

607
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,709
In fact, I'm nota big drinker at all.

608
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,166
Sorry.

609
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,417
Keep the change.

610
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,834
- Thanks.- I'm a big tipper.

611
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:14,208
I have to go home.I got a--

612
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,458
You have a what?

613
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,667
A cat. I have a catI got to feed, but...

614
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,291
But I think I might havealready fed him.

616
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,959
Liz: I would have gone out with him anyway.

617
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,458
It was more money than I made in a whole week.

618
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,125
I thought, "Who cares? What do I have to lose?"

619
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:40,041
I'll just lock up.It'll only be a minute.

620
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,792
Liz: Doing it for money--

621
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,709
it's like losing your virginity.

622
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:53,709
The next time, it's a whole lot easier.

00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,709
I mean,even if there's nothing.

645
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,709
No heaven, I mean.

646
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:12,542
Even if heaven ain'tlike they say it is.

647
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:15,875
All saints and angels.

648
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,166
I mean,

649
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:20,667
even if it's justpeace and quiet.

650
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:24,208
I could sure usesome of that.

651
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,583
Hell couldn't be any worsethan this now, could it?

652
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,333
The big tease.

653
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,500
They love it and they thinkyou love it, too.

654
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,166
They wanna hearall about it.

655
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,166
( lowered )"Talk to me," they'd say.

656
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:07,709
I know what they mean now,but at first I didn't.

657
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:10,125
"What do you want meto talk about," I'd say.

658
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,250
( lowered )"What do you like doing?"

659
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,667
I don't know.I like watching TV.

660
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,458
( lowered )"No, not that.What am I doing to you?"

661
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,291
"What you doing to me?"

662
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,208
( lowered )"Yeah. Tell me, tell me.What am I doing to you?"

663
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,083
I was still young.

664
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,375
I didn't know whatthey wanted me to say.

665
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,500
Now when they ask,

666
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,333
I know what they want.

667
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,625
As soon as theyget their dick outand ask me if I like it.

668
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,291
I whisper to them,

669
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,000
"Oh, honey,it's a beautiful cock.

670
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,041
It's so big and hard."

671
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:45,542
( lowered )"What do you want meto do with it," they'd say.

672
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,041
I'd love toreally tell 'em.

673
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,542
But instead, I say,

674
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:51,458
"Oh, my pussy'sreally hungry

675
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,291
for your big,hard cock.

676
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,125
Come on, give it to me.Give it to me."

677
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,917
Yeah.

678
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:04,083
But then thereare those who want to dothe talking themselves.

679
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,792
I mean, talk dirty.

680
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,875
Sometimes it feels like they just--

681
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,917
they just want to rip you open.

682
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,667
Hey, be a littlegentle, huh?

683
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,542
Shut your fucking trap.

684
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,750
Liz: So I just shut up and let 'em do their thing.

685
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,375
I close my eyes.

686
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:22,500
I don't want to see the hate in their faces.

687
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,709
They must haveterrible lives.

688
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,792
The men, I mean.

689
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,458
Something must have happenedto 'em to make 'em like that.

690
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,750
They weren't born that way,were they?

691
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:42,291
Maybe they'rehenpecked at home.

692
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,917
Or bossed around at work

693
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:50,250
so they feel humiliated.

694
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,709
They want to humiliatesomebody back.

695
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,083
Makes 'em feel better.

696
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,208
More important.

697
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,625
It's nothing personal.

698
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,458
I know that.

699
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:06,500
They don't even want sex,you know.

700
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,875
It's more like...

701
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,291
like revenge.

702
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,542
Yeah.

703
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:17,792
That's it.

704
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,375
They only want revenge.

705
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,333
( water running )

706
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,208
( man moaning )

707
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,834
I feel sorryfor their wives.

708
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:47,750
Most of the menwho come in heremust be married.

709
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,834
And they come here

710
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,500
because we'll dothe things

711
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,667
their wivesand girlfriendswon't do.

712
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:57,291
Head. That's whatmost of 'em ask for.

713
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,583
I mean,I don't see why

714
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,083
a woman would havea problem

715
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,500
with stickingher man's cockin her mouth?

716
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,792
I mean,I guarantee you

717
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,917
if he ain't sticking itin her mouth,

718
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:11,667
he'll be sticking itin somebody else's.

719
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,041
Could be hers,could be mine.

720
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,166
We're substitutes.

721
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,000
I bet you

722
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,667
he's got his eyes shut

723
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,125
thinking of his wife right now.

724
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,667
( moaning continues )

725
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,792
Me?

726
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:30,709
I don't wanna see another dickas long as I live.

727
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:33,291
Ugh.

728
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,792
( sighs )

729
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:37,375
I've lost countof how many I've had.

730
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,333
Must be miles.

731
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,375
( moaning continues )

732
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,542
I used to love sex.

733
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:50,083
I used to loveeverything about it.

734
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,041
Now when I go to bed,

735
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,959
all I want to dois go to sleep.

736
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:59,125
And I bet youI've had more sexin places like this

737
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,875
than I've ever hadin a bed.

738
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,542
I should writea book about it--

739
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,500
"The ToiletsI Have Known."

740
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,583
I met my best friendin one.

741
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,917
Well, she was.

742
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,917
I was working downtown.

743
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,750
Hanging around looking for tricks

744
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,000
when this girl comes along acting like she's stoned

745
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,875
or drunk or something.

746
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,041
And then I see the blood and I just look at her

747
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,875
and I say, "What the fuck?"

748
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,792
And she just says, "Blake."

749
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,417
And I see the bastard had cut her

750
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,542
right across the stomach. And then I thought,

751
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:36,083
"If I don't do something fast, she's gonna bleed to death."

752
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,125
So I go rushing her into the theater

753
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,625
and I yell to the chick in the box, "Get an ambulance."

754
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,166
I guess she must have just got the manager

755
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,792
'cause after a while, this bitch comes busting in and starts laying into us.

756
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,125
Calling us dirty, filthy sluts.

757
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,166
And I'm trying to stop the blood, but it just won't fucking stop.

758
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,166
And the poor girl, she's starting to go into shock

759
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,959
and the manager's yelling at us

760
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:58,125
about AIDS and trying to kick us out.

761
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,250
Without getting too close, of course.

762
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,291
But the blood just kept coming.

763
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,375
And then in comes Katie.

764
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,917
She sorta took control right away, you know.

765
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:09,083
I mean, even got the manager to help out.

766
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,458
She told her to imagine it was her daughter.

767
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,834
If it wasn't for Katie,

768
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:30,834
I don't think the girl would've pulled through.

769
00:42:30,834 --> 00:42:33,333
Katie wanted to know why she didn't go to the cops.

770
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,000
I laughed.

771
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I told her Blake pays the cops to look the other way.

772
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,583
Anyway, he got her a few weeks later,

773
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,166
but this time, the knife went straight through.

774
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,750
That was a terrible week.

775
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,166
I don't know what the hell I would've done without Katie.

776
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,250
She looked after me like a sister would.

777
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,417
If I would've had one.

778
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,583
Sometimes I wonder why my parents ever had me.

779
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,709
They must've been drunk.

780
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:02,417
I guess I was why Dad left home.

781
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,041
Katie was the only person

782
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,583
I ever knew that never wanted.

783
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,667
I wanted. I needed.

784
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:14,542
There were nights I needed so badly just to be held.

785
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,375
For my birthday,

786
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,041
Katie bought me a book.

787
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,125
Nobody ever gave me a book before.

788
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,917
It's called "Animal Farm"

789
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:24,333
and I'm telling you, it's just like life.

790
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,917
It's about animals, but it's not for kids.

791
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:29,500
It's the best book I ever read.

792
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,625
Well, it's the only book I ever read.

793
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:35,375
And on the inside cover she wrote,

794
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,041
"To Liz

795
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:40,542
with love and all beautiful things. K."

796
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:44,458
Sometimes I used to open it just to read that.

797
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,375
I just loved being with her.

798
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,333
She even turned me on

799
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,583
to serious music for a while.

800
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,417
( music playing )

801
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,750
She was so smart.

802
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,917
She could make almost anything sound interesting.

803
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,458
Katie worked as a bartender.

804
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,792
She made good money, but what a waste.

805
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,750
I mean, she went to junior college.

806
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,250
I kept telling her she should get a good job

807
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,125
like a teacher or something.

808
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,875
She'd make a great teacher.

809
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,959
God, I wish I had her brains.

810
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:34,625
And I told her that.

811
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,375
She said there's nothing wrong with my brain,

812
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,125
only my education.

813
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:39,917
My education?

814
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,291
That can't be right

815
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,208
'cause I hardly finished school.

816
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,792
I mean, I haven't been in school for so long

817
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:47,709
that I can't even remember anything.

818
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,458
( man moaning )

819
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,667
That was the end of Katie and me.

820
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,375
( woman smacking lips )

821
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,959
Sharp as a razor.

822
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:51,750
And I'd use it, too.

823
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,000
Once I'd use it on myself.

824
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,041
But now I'd fight back.

825
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,542
That's Katie.

826
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:02,375
( man moaning louder )

827
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:14,083
Huh. Dignity.

828
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,250
( bicycle horn honks )

829
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,834
Oh, it's you.

830
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:02,709
You suddenly takin'a liking to rubbers?

831
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:05,667
I thought you might havetaken a disliking to them.

832
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:08,083
- Not on your life.- But I'm exceedingly clean.

833
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,875
I'm sure you are.

834
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,333
But look, it's no usesitting there

835
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,750
because I'm notgonna change my mind.

836
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,750
I don't carehow much you pay me.

837
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,333
And I'm not gonna doany business with yousitting here either,

838
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,792
so why don't youjust fuck off?

839
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:21,792
And take yourlittle horn with you.

840
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:23,834
( horn honks )

841
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,750
Why do you insistupon a rubber?

842
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,208
Crabs, clap, syphilis,herpes, AIDS, chlamydia.

843
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,333
Is that enough for youor do you want more?

844
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,125
I mean, with all that,

845
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,792
what could you possibly haveagainst a rubber, huh?

846
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,792
It's not that I haveanything against them.

847
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,458
It's just that they areusually too small for me.

848
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,875
You gotta be kidding.

849
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:54,750
No. I am not.

850
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,083
I have a very stoutmember.

851
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,208
( laughs )

852
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,417
Well, that's the best newsI've heard all day.

853
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:04,291
I'm thrilled for you.Congratulations.

854
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:06,125
Thank you.

855
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,458
But the pleasure is yours.

856
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,166
Oh, Jesus.

857
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:12,583
You guys still believethat shit, don't you?

858
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:15,667
"In a recentnationwide survey,

859
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,959
eight out of 10 prostituteswho expressed preference

860
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:21,000
said that their vaginapreferred small 'members.'"

861
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,083
It sounds like it turns you on,but it does nothing for me.

862
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:26,041
Comprende?

863
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,542
It's the cops.

864
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,875
I suggest you getthe hell outta here.

865
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:36,000
You go down the streetand then you hang a left.

866
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,750
You go onto the freewaythere and it's right thereon your right.

867
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,417
You can't miss it.The gas station isopen all night.

Uh-huh. Thank you.You are most kind.

869
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:45,709
You're welcome.

870
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:48,083

00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:04,208

00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:12,000

00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:15,709
or were you gonnacuff me to your spoke?

878
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:17,542
( laughs )

879
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:19,917
Shit.

880
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,542
Cops.

881
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:26,583
Now there's a confusedbunch for ya.

882
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,125
They don't knowwhat they want,

883
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,166
so they're alwaysgiving you a choice.

884
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,000
Like this last time.This vice cop,

885
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,917
he says to me,"Give me head oryou're going to jail."

886
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,458
So I give him head.

887
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:39,500
And then the fucker busts mefor jaywalking.

888
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,291
I didn't use the crosswalkon the way to his dick.

889
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:45,542
Well, excuse me, Officer,but if your dick had beenlong enough,

890
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:48,166
I wouldn't have had tocross the fucking street.

891
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,125
I wish the beach boyshad busted me.

892
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,417
I could usea night in jail.

893
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,500
Just for the rest,you know?

894
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,917
Hey.( gasps )

895
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:08,000
Missed you, baby.

896
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:11,500
So how muchdid we do tonight?

897
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:14,959
It's-- it's been slow, man.

898
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:17,458
Oh, yeah?So what have you done?

899
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:20,125
Hey, I told you.It's been slow.

900
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,750
So you've probably done,what, four 30s.

901
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,542
You might have caughta 50 or two? What is that?

902
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:27,583
- Four 30s, we're talking 120.- Just forget about it.

903
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,458
Wait a minute.What did I say?

904
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:31,542
You said four 30s,but--

905
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:35,291
Four 30s and two 50s.

906
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,250
Well, it's been slow, right?

907
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,792
Yeah.

908
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:41,709

00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,125
one 50.

910
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,417
You might have gotten boredand did a quick 20.

911
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,125
Hey, wait a minute.

912
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:50,166
What the fuck am I thinking?I forgot about yesterday.

913
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,083
( gasps )

914
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,166

00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,917
Welfare work?

918
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,500
You've been with thatbookworm again, hmm?

919
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,750
- That dyke Katie.- No. No, no. I--

920
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,166
I told you once before,reading is bad for your eyes.

921
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:12,041
Hey, man, I swear.I haven't seen Katie.

922
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:14,917

923
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,917

924
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:19,166

928
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,375
- You stink of booze.- I'm telling you the truth.

929
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,750
- How 'bout a dollar, then, mon?- Get the fuck outta here!

930
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,417

931
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:36,333

932
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,792

934
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,041
- Listen to the woman.- Leave him alone!

935
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,709
( gasps )

936
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:46,834
I don't got any more.I swear on my mother.

937
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:49,750
Well, your mother's dead.So you better swear onsomebody else,

938
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,291
but dust don't countin my book.

939
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:54,417
I'm gonna be backin an hour.

940
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:56,083
You better have donefour by then.

941
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,208
I don't care whatyou have to do to catch cock.

942
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,333
Lie in the streetwith your fucking legsin the air.

943
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,041
Just do it.

944
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,917
Was that third finger left handor third finger right?

945
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,458
Take your pick!

946
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,542
I got it.

947
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,834
Who the fuckdoes she think she is?

948
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,250
You only need onelike that.

949
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,500
One bad apple

950
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,250
and all the others rot.

951
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:36,917
And if she thinksthat she can dump me

952
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:39,083
like I was one of herfucking tricks, well,

953
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:43,041
she's gota big surprise coming.

954
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,417
Protection.He is my protection.

955
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:48,083
I mean, we can't evencarry a knife anymore.

956
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,875
You get caught,they bust you

957
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,458
on a concealedweapons charge.

958
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:55,542
You work on your back,you gotta have a middleman.

959
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:59,041
Or you could end upon your back in the morgue.

960
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,208
I got somebody that willfix her up.

961
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,000
And he'll fix her for good.They'll never recognize her.

962
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,583
Even if they do,who cares?

963
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,125
She's a whore.

964
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,375
Hey, it was a trick,wasn't it?

965
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:22,208
I mean, there are a lotof freaky tricks around,you know?

966
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:26,458
Sometimes tricks,they--

967
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:29,208
they freak out.

968
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,000
What can you do?

969
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,000
There's this one,right,

970
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,125
he was young,but he was small.

971
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,709
He was vicious and startssticking it in me right away.

972
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:42,208
All of a sudden,he starts kissing me.

973
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:45,083
Man, I never kiss nobody.

974
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,709
You never do.

975
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:49,041
I mean,I'll suck their cock,they can lick me,

976
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,166
they can fuck me,but no kissing.

977
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,917
And no fingers neither.

978
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,333
I mean, you shouldsee their nails.

979
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,417
I mean, who knows wheretheir fingers have been?

980
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,333
No suckingmy breasts neither.

981
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,667
So anyway, this guy,he starts trying to kiss me.

982
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,291
So I said to him,"Hey, man, I don't kiss."

983
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,834
He didn't seem to mind.

984
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:07,291
All of a suddenhe says to me,

985
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,083
( lowered )"Is it nice?"

986
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,291
I said to him,"Is what nice?"

987
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,959
( lowered )He says, "This,"

988
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:15,542
and pushes it ineven harder.

989
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:18,417
Now I know he wanted me to talk dirty, right?

990
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:21,375
I was still pretty new to the game. I didn't understand.

991
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:23,709
So I said, "It's all right, I guess."

992
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:26,375
( lowered ) "All right? All right?" he says. "Is that all?"

993
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:28,875
And then he pulls out. So I asked him why he pulled out.

994
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:31,542
And he says, ( lowered ) "Because you're not enjoying it."

995
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:33,375
I said, "Hey, I don't have to enjoy it.

996
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,083
You paid for it. You enjoy it."

997
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:37,166
And he goes, ( lowered ) "But I can't enjoy it

998
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:39,375
if I know you're only doing it because I paid you."

999
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,625
Well, if you want passion, that costs extra.

1000
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:45,041
By then his time was up, so I asked him if he was finished.

1001
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:46,709
( lowered ) "Finished?" he says.

1002
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:48,500
"I haven't even started yet. Kiss me."

1003
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,792
So he yanks my head and he starts trying to kiss me.

1004
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,333
And I'm trying to push him away and then he starts shouting to me,

1005
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,417
( lowered ) "You fucking cunts! You're all the same!

1006
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,417
You're dead, all of ya! No feelings!"

1007
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,875
And then he starts trying to kiss me again.

1008
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:01,583
Then he asks for his money back.

1009
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:04,417
I said, "Sorry. No deposit, no return."

1010
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:06,542
Then I tried to get up and get out.

1011
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:09,083
Suddenly, he grabs my bag with one and my hair with the other

1012
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,917
and he starts banging my head against the floor.

1013
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,458
I mean, I thought my fucking brain was gonna explode.

1014
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:15,834
I'm telling you, he must have slammed my head about six times

1015
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:18,333
before that damn door finally opened.

1016
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,500
You oughta be more carefulwith who you date.

1017
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,834
That's when I realized,

1018
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:30,917
you can't workwithout a pimp.

1019
00:55:30,917 --> 00:55:33,625
So I becameone of Blake's girls.

1020
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,583
Well,it seems to me

1021
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,625
like this pimpset you up, mon.

1022
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,125
Yeah. I thoughtof that, too.

1023
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,500
And one day I put itto him point-blank.

1024
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,291
And point-blankhe denied it.

1025
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:49,458
Practically knockedmy goddamn teethdown my throat.

1026
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:51,583
Me and my girls.

1027
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:53,458
I look after 'em.

1028
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:56,417
I'm out all hourskeeping an eye out on 'em

1029
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:58,583
just to make surethey're safe.

1030
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:01,375
I drive aroundjust checking.

1031
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,959
I know all the placesthat they go with their dates.

1032
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:11,750
Sometimes I follow 'em.

1033
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:15,375
You see, we're likebusiness partners.

1034
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,291
They fuck

1035
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,834
and I manage.

1036
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,709
Tell me something.

1037
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:23,750
How much doeshe make off you?

1038
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,083
What's hisprofit margin?

1039
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,667
What's that gotto do with it?

1040
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,375
Have some herb.

1041
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,083
If I'm not payingfor their rent,

1042
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:41,458
I'm paying fortheir goddamn fines.

1043
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,959
( sniffs )I pay for their clothes,

1044
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:46,125
their checkups.

1045
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,625
I pay for their rubbers.

1046
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,000
( sniffs )

1047
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,917
Even at wholesale,they're still expensive.

1048
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:57,041
Or as I tell you,

1049
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,959
they don't come cheap.

1050
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:00,166
( sniffs )

1051
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,500
So how muchyou say he takes?

1052
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,291
100%.

1053
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,583
Mon, it's likeyou're gettingscrewed twice.

1054
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:11,959
Hmm.

1055
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,542
Look, it's just likeI was managing a factory.

1056
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,417
This, it just happensto be a pussy factory.

1057
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:23,458
This is exactly whyI'm trying to getaway from him.

1058
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:26,542
Even factories treattheir employees better.

1059
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:28,333
At leastthey get benefits.

1060
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,500
Mm.

1061
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,709
But it's still a factory

1062
00:57:32,709 --> 00:57:35,333
with employees

1063
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:37,959
and somebody like merunning things.

1064
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:41,792
I got what they call

1065
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,417
"entrepreneurial flair."

1066
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,458
I can see a need

1067
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,417
and I fill a demand.

1068
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:52,583
The man is a slave driver.

1069
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,792
Holy shit.Just look at that one.

1070
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:58,291
Dumb kid.

1071
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:05,458
( horn honks )

1072
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:11,000
( horn honks )

1073
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:15,083
She supposed to beselling sex.

1074
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,208
It looks like she's waitingfor the goddamn bus.

1075
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:19,834
Okay, so it's hot,your shoes hurt,

1076
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,750
and she had an abortionlast week.

1077
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,083
Guess who picked upthe tab on that one.

1078
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,625
Everybody starts off

1079
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:27,792
by thinking they're gonnamake a lot of money

1080
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,917
and get out of itin a couple of years.

1081
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:32,208
But it never happens.

1082
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,250
You just stay doing it.

1083
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,417
I've seen some pretty kids

1084
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:39,542
with faces like dogsafter only six months.

1085
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:41,333
You know,

1086
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:45,250
they say you can tell a womanthat's been doing this.

1087
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,625
That it shows in her face.

1088
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,959
I mean, look at mine.

1089
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:54,625
Does it show?

1090
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:59,208
In my eyes?That's where it starts,they say.

1091
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,166
In the eyes and thenin the mouth. All hard.

1092
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,875
They're wrong.

1093
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,166
Yeah.They're full of shit.

1094
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,709
You better believethey're full of shit.

1095
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:11,625
Yeah. They're full of shit.You know why?

1096
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,375
Because itstarts in here.

1097
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,208
It's like a cancer

1098
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,834
and then it just startseating away at you untilthere's nothing left.

1099
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:21,500
Just an empty shell.

1100
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,333
They're oversexedand they're born like that.

1101
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:28,375
Nature's rejectsfrom the moment that theycame into this world.

1102
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,583
All they have to offeris their bodies,

1103
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,834
so they might as wellget paid for it.

1104
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:35,542
They're bornwith a price tag.

1105
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:39,250
If somebody gave 'ema million bucks,

1106
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,709
they'd be back onthe streets in a week.

1107
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:42,458
They can'thelp themselves.

1108
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,917
There's nothingyou can do about it.

1109
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,041
It's like being bornblack or white.

1110
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:52,041
It's just the way they are.

1111
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:54,333
I must be some useto somebody.

1112
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:58,041
I mean, there must bea reason for me.

1113
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:01,083
Right?

1114
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:03,458
You know, years ago,when I first got started,

1115
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,458
before I got thingsstraightened out around here,

1116
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,834
I was alwaysgetting busted

1117
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:11,375
for pandering,pimping.

1118
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,500
Do you thinkwhat I do is wrong?

1119
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,208
I think whata pimp doesis wrong.

1120
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:21,709
I think it's the lawthat's wrong.

1121
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:23,834
Katie called hima parasite.

1122
01:00:23,834 --> 01:00:26,834
Parasite.

1123
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:29,083
Parasite.

1124
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,542
I like that word.

1125
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:33,417
Parasite.

1126
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:36,458
Look, if it was illegalto live off the earningsof others,

1127
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:39,083
then the stock exchangewould be shut down tomorrow.

1128
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:42,667
And all the employment agencieswould be charged with pimping.

1129
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:45,583
I'm like an employmentagency myself,

1130
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,291
only I'm not legal.

1131
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,125
And I don't wantto be illegal.

1132
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:52,083
You know,you should be legal.

1133
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,417
Then there wouldn't bea need for him.

1134
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:01,125
You make it legaland I'll open an office.

1135
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,125
Until then,

1136
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:05,291
this is my office.

1137
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:08,291
Some of our regulars,they phone me.

1138
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,542
And they tell me whatthey want and I deliver.

1139
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:14,250
Maybe I'm nothing morethan takeout food.

1140
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,375
Easy, quick,and affordable.

1141
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,667
I'm sort ofa dial-a-ride service.

1142
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:22,125
And I'm real charitable, too.

1143
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,875
I always make sureI give a little back.

1144
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,500
I even makeregular donations

1145
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,917
to the policemen'spension fund.

1146
01:01:29,917 --> 01:01:32,291
( laughs )

1147
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,875
Do you thinkfor some men,

1148
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:48,458
even a few,

1149
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,166
that I'm a curefor loneliness?

1150
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:02,208
Maybe a short-term cure.

1151
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,709
The more I think about it,

1152
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:19,542
the more I'd really like to change my life.

1153
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:22,500
If only I could find a decent man.

1154
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,709
Or even a man that just wanted a...

1155
01:02:26,834 --> 01:02:28,917
what you call it?You know, they got a wife

1156
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:32,250
and then they got a...a mistress. Yeah, that's it.

1157
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,291
I'd really love that.

1158
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,875
Where in the hellam I gonna find that?

1159
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,875
( horn honks )

1160
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,375
Hey, you wanna move in?

1161
01:02:42,542 --> 01:02:44,375
Can you affordthe down payment?

1162
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,208
Who knows? Come here.

1163
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,417
What sign are you?

1164
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:53,542
- What sign am I?- Quickly.

1165
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:56,583
I'm a stop sign.

1166
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,792
Ow! You're a Scorpio.

1167
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:00,625
- You're a Scorpio, aren't you?- Yeah, I'm a Scorpio.

1168
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,625
- Hey, how'd you know?- Shit. I need a Virgo.

1169
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,417
Do you know whereI can find one?

1170
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:06,875
- I'll be a Virgo for 40.- No, no. I need a real one.

1171
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,792
And my cards sayI can only pay 10.

1172
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:12,542
- ( sighs )- You have the most beautiful eyes.

1173
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,000
I'll catch youin another lifetime.

1174
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,417
Bye.

1175
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:19,750
What a weirdo.

1176
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,041
I wonder what he was into.

1177
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,959
Eh, I don't mind

1178
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:28,208
something differentonce in a while,

1179
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:32,000
but I don't donothing dirty.

1180
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,291
You know?I mean,

1181
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:36,583
I don't takegolden showers

1182
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:40,250
and I don't givegolden showers.

1183
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,875
But...

1184
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,917
well,

1185
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,542
there was this one guy,right,

1186
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:49,041
he used to like watching metake a dump, okay?

1187
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:51,250
I mean, he useda flashlight.

1188
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,417
Trouble is,he always seemed to show up

1189
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,125
after I'd already had one.

1190
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,375
I haven't seen him aroundin a while.

1191
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,291
Guess he found someonemore regular.

1192
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,959
Yeah, but I gotthis other trick,

1193
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:06,458
he's an older guy,you know.

1194
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,083
Real soft-spoken.

1195
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:11,959
I swear, he could bea judge or doctor or something.

1196
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:15,291
And we have a regular dateevery Thursday at 3:00.

1197
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:18,375
And he always pays mewith brand-new money.

1198
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,875
Get the money first. That's my motto.

1199
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,041
But before I could get my pants down,

1200
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,417
he's shaking his head.

1201
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:28,291
So I offer him a tit job.

1202
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,000
Strike two.

1203
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,291
When I realized he didn't want straight sex,

1204
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,125
I thought, "Hello, another nut."

1205
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,583
And I let him know I didn't do nothing dirty.

1206
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,041
I don't do anything dirty.

1207
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,709
Then he just nods and points to my shoe.

1208
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:50,125
For a minute, I thought he was gonna fuck me with it.

1209
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,834
I mean, you wouldn't believe

1210
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:54,000
some of the things they've tried to stick up me.

1211
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,792
Then he gives me this piece of paper

1212
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,792
and tells me not to read it until he says so.

1213
01:04:57,792 --> 01:05:00,542
Finally, he gets his dick out, right?

1214
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,792
What do youwant me to do?

1215
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:04,500
Read me the note.

1216
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,625
About now, he's starting to get a hard on.

1217
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,834
Liz: "You naughty boy, Johnny.

1218
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:11,834
You dirty little boy.Mommy's very, veryangry with you"?

1219
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,625
( groaning )Louder.

1220
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,709
Liz: And before you know it, he's beating his meat

1221
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:17,750
and licking my shoe.

1222
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,792
"You naughty boy, Johnny.

1223
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,125
You dirty little boy.

1224
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:27,917
Mommy's very, very angry with you.

1225
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,750
You naughty boy, Johnny!

1226
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:32,083
You dirty little boy!

1227
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:35,667
Mommy's very,very angry with you!

1228
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:38,667
You naughty boy, Johnny!

1229
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,750
You dirty little boy!

1230
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,667
Mommy's very, very, very,very angry with you"!

1231
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,875
( groaning continues ) Keep it up.

1232
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:50,041
( yawns )"You naughty boy, Johnny.

1233
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:52,083
You dirty little boy,Johnny.

1234
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,959
Mommy's very,very angry with you."

1235
01:05:54,959 --> 01:05:56,917
( laughing )

1236
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,667
Liz: Different strokes for different folks.

1237
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:04,583
Who can figure it? But that's how Johnny came.

1238
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:14,041
Yeah, I know my lines now,

1239
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,291
but he's always quick.

1240
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:17,917
That's what you want, quick.

1241
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:20,333
I mean, some of 'emtake forever.

1242
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:23,208
The nervous ones,they can be a real bitch.

1243
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,750
Sometimes they never geta hard-on at all.

1244
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,208
They're too embarrassedto ask for their money back.

1245
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:30,917
Hey, they wouldn'tget it back anyway.

1246
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:33,375
I mean, if you goto a restaurant and youorder a meal

1247
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:36,291
and you suddenlylose your appetite,it's not my fault, is it?

1248
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:39,750
The best guys are the onesin the lunch hour.

1249
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,375
They're always in a rush.

1250
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:43,542
Or the older guys.They're good, too.

1251
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,583
I mean, sometimesI'm putting the rubber on

1252
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,792
and then all of a sudden, oops.It's all over.

1253
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:50,000
"Oh, honey. I needed that,"I'd say to them

1254
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,667
and finish them offwith my hand

1255
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:55,000
and pretend to bereal disappointed and stuff.

1256
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,709
You know, so theydon't feel cheated.

1257
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:02,125
( sighs )

1258
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,291
But you knowwho the worst ones are?

1259
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,041
The young ones.

1260
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:10,375
I mean, they're alwayslaying these head trs on you.

1261
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:13,291
Like, ( whiny )"Usually I don't haveto pay for it."

1262
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,750
I mean,I don't want to hear that.

1263
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,959
I don't got timefor that shit.

1264
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:20,208
And then they startholding out on you

1265
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,542
like they're doing yousome big favor or something.

1266
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:24,625
Thanks,but no, thanks.

1267
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,417
I mean, for them,I need a meter like a taxi.

1268
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,208
No, I like the onesthat just want to hurry up,

1269
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:34,166
- get it over with,and go home.- ( clapping )

1270
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,583
Yeah, I'm going home.

1271
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:54,375
( playing harmonica )

1272
01:08:09,959 --> 01:08:11,750
That's Chris.

1273
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,375
Handsome, isn't he?

1274
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,333
He's so smart.

1275
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,792
He's six now.

1276
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,667
Yeah, he's atthat age where--

1277
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:25,542
well, you know,he's grown up and...

1278
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:28,166
well, if hewas living with me,

1279
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:30,041
how would I explain it?

1280
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:32,500
I mean,I work at night,

1281
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,709
so you could sayI got a night job.

1282
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:39,166
But then when I go to jailand I don't come homeduring the day,

1283
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:41,208
I mean,how do I explain that?

1284
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:43,875
Everybody says he's smart.

1285
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,709
You should hear him read.

1286
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:50,250
He knows all the animals.

1287
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:53,750
I taught him that.

1288
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,917
He loves animals.

1289
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:01,083
He sent me this paintingof his cat.

1290
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:04,250
"This is Mandy,"he wrote on the back.

1291
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,959
"She sleeps inthe washing machine."

1292
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:12,834
He's with a nice couple.

1293
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:15,166
They don't haveany kids of their own.

1294
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:20,083
He was sort of adopted.

1295
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,125
After my mom died...

1296
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:28,917
the courts saidI was an unfit mother.

1297
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,792
Yeah, that's whenI moved on.

1298
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:39,959
Chris seemshappy enough, though.

1299
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,417
I wish he was with me,

1300
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:48,625
but I can see himwhenever I want to.

1301
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:52,208
But I have to call first,but...

1302
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,333
uh, I don't go back theretoo much.

1303
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:04,792
It kinda upsets me.

1304
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,792
Last time I went back there, I didn't tell him I was coming.

1305
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:11,750
I stood outside his school

1306
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,000
and waited for the class to end.

1307
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,166
He was wearing the jeans I'd sent him for his birthday.

1308
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:21,208
They're probably still a little too big for him,

1309
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:24,333
but he'll grow into them.

1310
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,166
His foster mother Rachel,

1311
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:29,667
she was there waiting to take him home.

1312
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,125
I could hardly stand to see him go,

1313
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:35,834
but I don't think

1314
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:37,834
I'll go back there again, you know.

1315
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,333
No, not for a while anyway.

1316
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:43,375
I don't want Chris growing up hating me.

1317
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:46,834
I don't want him to be ashamed of his mother.

1318
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,208
I know he calls Rachel mom,

1319
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:55,750
but he knows whohis real mother is.

1320
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:07,375
What I wouldn't givefor a nice, cool shower.

1321
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:12,583
No, Chris is better offwhere he is.

1322
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,458
For now, I know that.

1323
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,625
He looks just likehis father.

1324
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,041
We're still married.

1325
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:27,875
Chances are we'd stillbe together if he hadn'tcheated on me.

1326
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:30,625
I never cheated on him.

1327
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:34,250
Hey, what I do isn't exactlymaking love, is it?

1328
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,083
Hate would be closerto the truth.

1329
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:40,166
I mean,it isn't even sex

1330
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:42,375
because sexhas some feelings.

1331
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,792
I mean, if you like somebody,that's sex.

1332
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:48,792
Well, I don't likeany of these shits.

1333
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,125
No, there must bea better word for what I do.

1334
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,291
But I don't knowwhat it is.

1335
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,000
It's mechanical.

1336
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,250
No feelings.

1337
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:04,250
No.

1338
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:08,583
I mean, maybe if you reallypsyched yourself up for it,

1339
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,458
you could feel something.

1340
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:13,125
Who wants togo through all that?

1341
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,959
I mean,when I was younger,

1342
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:17,417
I used to make believe

1343
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,542
somebody out herewas loving me.

1344
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:24,917
But then I got to the pointwhere I just hated tricks.

1345
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:26,792
I hate 'em.

1346
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:28,917
And they don'tlike us, neither.

1347
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:31,208
I mean, really like us.

1348
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:34,125
Oh, they want us, all right.I didn't say that.

1349
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:37,041
But like us?No. No way.

1350
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,542
And you never knowwho you're with.

1351
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:45,583
A total strangeror your own father.

1352
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:46,959
You just don't know.

1353
01:12:46,959 --> 01:12:49,083
I mean, they're likeJekyll and Hyde.

1354
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:52,125
You gotta watch 'em 'causethey're always up to something.

1355
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,875
( bicycle horn honks )

1356
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:03,625
20 bucks, sweetie.20 bucks.

1357
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,417
- Okay? - Yeah, try her.

1358
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:07,834
She'll probably do itfor a food stamp, asshole.

1359
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,875
I'm ready.

1360
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:14,834
You're cute.

1361
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:16,792
( laughs )

1362
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,458
Poor old whore.

1363
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,500
That could be me someday.

1364
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,875
Nah. I'd kill myself first.

1365
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,166
( gasps )

1366
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,583
( horn honks )

1367
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:56,750
In your professionalopinion...

1368
01:13:58,709 --> 01:14:00,959
what do you thinkmy chances are?

1369
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:03,417
I'd say your chancesare 50/50.

1370
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:12,875
And for 50, I'm willingto take the gamble.

1371
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,583
Let's go.

1372
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:33,750

Oh, I want your big,hard cock inside.

1388
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:27,959
Oh, yeah.That's it.

1389
01:15:27,959 --> 01:15:30,583
There it is.Oh, yeah, baby.

1390
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,125
That feels good.

1391
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:35,333
Oh, honey,I'm so hot for you.

1392

Oh, yeah.Give it to me.

Mm.

1394
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:41,500
Oh, yeah.Honey, go, go.

1395
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:48,291
Oh, I really want it bad.

1396
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:50,208
Oh, give it to me, honey.

1397
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,000
Oh, yeah.

1398
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,583
Go, baby-- oops.

1399
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,166
Oh, that's it, big boy.

1400
01:15:57,166 --> 01:16:00,250
- Come on. Stick it in.- Oh!

1401
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,000
There we go.It's okay, honey.

1402
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,083
- Hang on.- Oh!

1403
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:09,166
There we go. Don't worryabout anything, honey.

1404
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,834
Mommy's going totake care of you.

1405
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:13,500
Mm.

1406
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,542
Do it to me, honey. Do it.

1407
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:17,333
Do it. I know you can.

1408
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,875
I know you can do it.

1409
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:23,625
Oh, yeah, honey. Mm.

1410
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,166
Oh, baby.Yeah, that's it.

1411

That's it.That's it.

1412
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,875
Yeah, oh.

1413
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,667
Do it. I know you can.

1414
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,625
( yelling )

1415
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,750
( grunts )Yeah.

1416
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,583
- Okay? - ( exhales sharply )

( zipper zips )

1420
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,625
See you in church, honey.

1421
01:16:58,709 --> 01:17:01,291
Don't just sit there,put yourself away.

1422
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,375
Hey, I know I'm good,but this is ridiculous.

1423
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:07,875
Come on, man.Stop joking.

1424
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:11,000
Hey. Hey, it ain'tfunny, man.

1425
01:17:12,917 --> 01:17:15,583
Hey. Hey!

1426
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:18,417
Oh, God.Oh, God! Oh!

1427
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:25,417
- Breathe!- What the fuck are youkissing him for?!

1428
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:28,417
- Don't fucking kiss him!- Let go of me!

1429
01:17:28,417 --> 01:17:30,542
What the fuck are youkissing him for?!

1430
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,500
( grunts )

1431
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,166
( coughs )

1432
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:36,083
Shit, what the fuckdid you do to him?

1433
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:38,583
- Nothing! - The fucker's dead.

1434
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:42,291
We gotta do something!We gotta call an ambulance!

1435
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:44,542
Stop it, damn it!

1436
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:47,333
- Where's his wallet?- Leave him alone!

1437
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:50,750
Don't!

1438
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,500
You stop it!You stop it!

1439
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,041
No, God damn it! No!

1440
01:18:03,709 --> 01:18:05,125
Now it's your turn.

1441
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,083
He wasn't just a trick!

1442
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,375
He had a life! ( crying )

1443
01:18:09,375 --> 01:18:12,542
It was disposable.

1444
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,750
Just like you.

1445
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,208
( screams )

1446
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:19,125
Now which finger was it?Huh? What was it you said?

1447
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,625
I said takeyour fucking pick!

1448
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:23,500
Oh, yeah?You stupid fucking whore.

1449
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,625
Oh, yeah?Well, I pick both!

1450
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,500
