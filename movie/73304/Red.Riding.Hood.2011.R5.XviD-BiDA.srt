00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
RED RIDING HOOD (2011)

2
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:04,082
That's a full moon.
good tonight.

3
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:15,702
It is better that the wolf to take the pig,
from you.

4
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,789
<i>We live on the edge
dark forest.</i>

5
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,258
<i>Few know the name of our village,</i>

6
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:28,209
<i>but many who heard
bad things happen there.</i>

7
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,337
<i>My mother always said:
"Do not talk to strangers."</i>

8
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:36,089
<i>"Take the water and go home."</i>

9
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:44,485
<i>I tried to be good
and to listen to him.</i>

10
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:46,441
Valerie!

11
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:48,536
<i>Believe me, I tried.</i>

12
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,521
Let's go!

13
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,807
You have a knife?

14
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:02,307
Here.

15
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:20,278
- See, fur is snow white!
- I will make boots.

16
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:35,121
- Do, Peter!
- No, do it yourself!

17
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:37,413
You can do it!

18
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:40,773
TEN YEARS LATER

19
00:03:57,179 --> 00:04:00,272
<i>I know that girls should not be cuminþi
for rabbit hunting</i>

20
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,487
<i>or to go alone in the forest.</i>

21
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:04,638
<i>But when we were young</i>

22
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,814
<i>He succeeded and that makes me
I want you to violate the rules.</i>

23
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:13,565
Peter! You find it all there,
after eating.

24
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,812
- Give here.
- What do I get for him?

25
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,501
- You are not logged say?
- What?

26
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,260
Did you manage to Improve
Henry Lazar.

27
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,948
My mother finally obtained
what he wants: money.

28
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,672
And Henry and accept what he wants
always: You.

29
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:39,017
What now?

30
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:43,682
- You want to marry him?
- You know not.

31
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:45,923
Prove it to me.

32
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,788
- How?
- Run with me.

33
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:56,003
- Where are we going?
- Wherever you want.

34
00:05:56,004 --> 00:06:04,441
Sea, city, mountains...

35
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:09,417
- Thi scared?
- No.

36
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:11,558
No?

37
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:13,364
Really?

38
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:16,593
Thi you leave home?

39
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:18,747
Family?

40
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,610
All your life?

41
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:28,972
- What will be with you.
- I thought you said this.

42
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:32,928
Really?

43
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,823
Let's do something
about it!

44
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,044
We must run
before someone may hook.

45
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:48,182
Let's go beyond!

46
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,245
Wolves!

47
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:28,107
- He killed again.
- But I keep the peace!

48
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:31,641
Wolf violated the agreement.

49
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:35,690
Who? Tell me!

50
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:38,585
Your sister.

51
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,661
Mom? Dad?

52
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,889
Lucy!

53
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,723
Thank you, Claude!

54
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:05,430
- Lazar Madam, please, go.
- Sorry.

55
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:09,343
- Grief.
- Thank you.

56
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:12,295
I'll take it.

57
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:19,477
- Hello, Henry!
- Lucy is a nice girl.

58
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:30,205
Now your fiancee.
Come to present their condoleanþele.

59
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,171
- I just know it.
- You know him and you.

60
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:39,458
Now go there. Please!

61
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:51,748
Cesa, join us at the bar.

62
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:57,102
Allow women to mourn
in their own way.

63
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,366
Go!

64
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,808
When I married your father,
not love.

65
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:33,454
I love another man,
but I must tell you that I loved my father.

66
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:39,968
And she gave me
two beautiful daughters.

67
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,998
- We should be grateful.
- Come on, Dad...

68
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:48,522
For nearly 20 years
Wolf never your life and honor.

69
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:54,592
20 years? Because we sacrifice
The best animal full moon.

70
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:59,278
- We met understanding.
- Now we will kill.

71
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:09,976
- I called the father of Solomon.
- Mr. Solomon?

72
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:14,293
Werewolves and wolves killed
in cities throughout the kingdom.

73
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:17,910
- We will get rid of the beast.
- No.

74
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,751
We'll widow revenge.

75
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:26,617
I wonder why roam outside.

76
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:32,109
- Can be seen by men.
- I think the kids.

77
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,667
My niece fell in love.

78
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:39,883
And seeing him as a cãþelu.

79
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:47,279
That night he learned
that Henry was engaged to her sister.

80
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,793
I think he broke my heart.

81
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:53,785
Maybe he would rather die
than live without him.

82
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:58,637
- How romantic!
- Prudence! It's horrible.

83
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:02,210
Not once told me.

84
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:08,401
Do not be afraid, honey.
Henry you always liked you.

85
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:12,666
You're beautiful.

86
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,873
I present condoleanþele.

87
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:29,555
I know exactly why you're here.

88
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:33,561
We've lost a daughter.
Valerie is all that is left.

89
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:39,791
- You can not give him.
- I have a job, for your husband!

90
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,507
I know how to produce
a lumberjack.

91
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:47,605
Henry is our chance
a better life.

92
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:54,065
If someone loves you, you throw it away.

93
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:14,230
You see the bones on the trail
Mount invite all.

94
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:16,383
There is a den of wolves.

95
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:22,230
If ghosts can not get out today
and do not walk on the earth and the saints.

96
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:25,379
- No silver bear.
- Have killed him.

97
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,801
Maybe father Auguste's rights.

98
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:31,452
Maybe you should wait.

99
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:40,877
Maybe my child will
to-find your courage.

100
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:46,067
- You want a wolf hunt? Let's hunt!
- Let us kill him!

101
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:50,034
Let's kill the beast! So cut off!

102
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,638
Let's go, Mom!

103
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,801
Let's go!

104
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:20,240
Watch out!

105
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,668
I lost my brother.
I can not lose and you.

106
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:29,324
We can not do that.
You must be married to Henry.

107
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:31,614
You know I do not want him!

108
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:38,279
Thi is not an illusion.
We have fun, that's it.

109
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,940
I do not believe.

110
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:57,103
Thi-I do things.

111
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:11,538
I wanted to wait until marriage,
but just in case...

112
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:18,894
You will be happy again...
Thi-appointment.

113
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,452
Come on Henry!

114
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:31,273
Will wait!
Let wait for the father of Solomon!

115
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:34,123
- We go tomorrow!
- We will kill the wolves in November!

116
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:40,831
Atâþia us? No one comes?
Let's go!

117
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:12,543
Adrien, thank you
and that you keep Lucy's side.

118
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:15,987
Soon we will be brothers.
You have to do the same.

119
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:46,597
- Promise me you'll care.
- Do not worry.

120
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:50,524
Wolves do not want me for me.
I'm a nobody.

121
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:58,746
- I mean, my son.
- I promise, Mom.

122
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:06,724
Grandma?

123
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,987
My Darling! Come on!

124
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:19,796
Be careful.

125
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:26,882
I hid so many things...

126
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:33,218
- I'm his sister, should know.
- That is the choice.

127
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,204
All of us have a secret.

128
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:47,498
Remember what my grandmother told me.

129
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:55,508
- Pain All the net...
- For bread.

130
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,196
Here. Probe it.

131
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:31,561
You're The so beautiful!

132
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:39,710
Whether preparing for your wedding.

133
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:55,475
I feel that my marriage
but they are sold.

134
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,551
Watch out!

135
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:43,002
Here is the crossroad.

136
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,995
Let us go bankrupt.

137
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:19,352
- Another crossroads.
- We take the steep road.

138
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:23,006
No. We must remain united.

139
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:33,656
Good morning, darling!

140
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:39,240
Good morning, Grandma!

141
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,662
<i>My grandmother told us that the wolf killings
family.</i>

142
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:48,533
<i>Stealing children's beds.</i>

143
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:53,287
<i>I believe that the real story
until now.</i>

144
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,940
Claude!

145
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,926
- For Adrien and his sacrifice!
- To Adrien!

146
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:24,500
Poor Henry... Dad...

147
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:37,716
Henry?

148
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:42,141
Your father is a brave man.

149
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:46,590
We were close and
I feel that I smell.

150
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:54,001
I'm afraid. I'm hiding.
When I move a finger.

151
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:57,481
There should be!

152
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:07,873
- Henry...
- Go!

153
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:11,800
I do not need your pity.

154
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:50,655
Henry's father
are the people you love!

155
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,772
Lucy loves Henry.
This is a year older than me.

156
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:57,333
She could marry him.
Why do you insist I do it?

157
00:24:57,334 --> 00:25:02,045
- I think you know the answer.
- I want him to say.

158
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:13,306
Henry's half sister Lucy.
Adrien is his father.

159
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:19,398
- I know about Lucy?
- No.

160
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,798
My Promise
that you will not say never.

161
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:35,248
Fr Solomon! Achieve!

162
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:32,652
- We present Eminenþa it...
- Pastor Solomon.

163
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,603
Dad!

164
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:51,211
Please, plângeþi not!
I know you see the children because they fear?

165
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:56,497
It is a wolf, big bad
and somebody should stop it.

166
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:00,461
Yes. These animals we kill her mother?

167
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:06,325
Could be.
Go. I come and soon.

168
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,117
Take it!

169
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:32,875
This is a real honor, Eminenþã.

170
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:36,986
Welcome!
You arrive on time for the festival.

171
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:43,146
As you can see,
I have a coat werewolf needle!

172
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,340
That's not a werewolf!

173
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:58,130
No offense, but we live
animals that the two generations.

174
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:00,806
We know what we do.

175
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:05,681
offended,
but you do not know what you're facing.

176
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:10,302
After me and I like you.

177
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:18,159
At my wife's name is Penelope.
Give me two beautiful daughters.

178
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:22,377
I am very happy family.

179
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:25,515
He lived in a village like this.

180
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:32,906
As Daggerhorn,
and we stepped on a werewolf.

181
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:38,037
Once, when he was a full moon
I'm drunk with my friends

182
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:40,302
and we decided to hunt him.

183
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:46,775
We never thought that we would find,
However, and has.

184
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:53,368
Broke my best friend
in two.

185
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:57,944
Hurry! Then I attacked.

186
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:03,610
I hit him with my ax.

187
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:09,916
All of a sudden... disappeared.

188
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,086
He had cut the front legs.

189
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:16,185
I want to keep as a memento
and I brought him home.

190
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:23,301
I found my wife with a cloth
occur in the wrist wrapped.

191
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:28,689
When I opened the bag
which makes the foot werewolf,

192
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,053
it's gone.

193
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:37,954
And I found this place.

194
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:48,290
I told my girl
werewolf that he killed his mother.

195
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:51,424
But it was a lie.

196
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,049
I killed him.

197
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,218
When a werewolf dies
return to human form.

198
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:04,360
That's just plain gray wolf.

199
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:13,393
You werewolf... lives and injured.

200
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:36,611
It's one of the three swords
Silver blessed by the pope.

201
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:40,553
- I can achieve?
- No.

202
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:44,663
We live in dangerous times.

203
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:48,384
You know what month it bleed?

204
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,575
Do not know what it means.

205
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,874
Astrological charts.

206
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:19,675
Red planet and met with Luna
once every 13 years.

207
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:24,869
Only then can be made
a new werewolf.

208
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,033
During the whorls week Monday,

209
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:32,467
He could send a werewolf
by floor bite curse.

210
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:36,871
Normal full moon,
floor of the werewolf bite to kill.

211
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:43,519
But no bloody moon,
Your soul is in danger.

212
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:51,132
With the past month within three days of bloody
You are not safe.

213
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:55,381
Yes we are.
I killed the wolf in its den.

214
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:57,105
In a cave in the mountains and Grimoore.

215
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:59,575
Animals deceived you in the beginning.

216
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:04,783
Do you think made you stand there,
who do not seek it where it's obvious.

217
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:14,385
Wolf lived here,
in this village, among you.

218
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:19,367
The real killer and can be
Your neighbor, best friend.

219
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:23,964
Maybe his wife.

220
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,452
- Baricadaþi village!
- You can not do that!

221
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:40,375
- Do not come out until you do not kill him!
- How do you want.

222
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:47,865
The wolf was dead. Celebrate tonight!

223
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:10,711
Very nice. Celebrating you.
We will see who is right.

224
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,060
The wolf is dead!

225
00:33:26,064 --> 00:33:27,604
Come on!

226
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:52,290
You breathe and you will hit home!

227
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:52,516
You blow... and you'll knock down the house!

228
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:09,468
I wash.
I'll be good to see the Pope.

229
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:12,087
Dad...

230
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,371
You're my little good girl.

231
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:22,909
- Sorry.
- I know. Home.

232
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,679
You cheated!

233
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,124
Impressive.

234
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:57,219
Where did you learn this?

235
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:02,312
Back to the party!

236
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:19,230
Ross makes a conquest.

237
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:40,031
Come on, Prudence!

238
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:36,601
- We have left the lake!
- Take it easy resin, buddy!

239
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:40,884
I said to stick together.
You go and my father died because of you!

240
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:43,181
Please, do not do that!

241
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:47,773
Remove the legs
Thi or cut them!

242
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,732
Leave me alone! What a great idea?
What have I done that for the pool and?

243
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,646
I love you, Peter.

244
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,448
What do you do with Rose?
In fact, no plates.

245
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:30,634
Not necessarily like
that you get what I want from it.

246
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:34,894
Do not you know all the thoughts.
I know you feel like me.

247
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,170
I feel that burns inside.

248
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:42,001
- I can not give anything like this Thi.
- Do you think Henry save money?

249
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:45,454
You have a future with him.
I'll let you destroy it.

250
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:53,333
- My mother has influenced you?
- Valerie, and not good for you.

251
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:58,367
I do not care.

252
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:16,715
He and I are all eaten...

253
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:02,381
I do not want you?

254
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,615
Peter! Come Help Us!

255
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:34,602
The only life that I want
is with you.

256
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:22,780
- Where did you go?
- You know that soft hay barn...

257
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:41,610
Go to church!

258
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:45,566
- Peter!
- Go!

259
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:56,999
You die now, the beast!

260
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,175
a wolf can not walk on the earth's saints!
Go to church!

261
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:12,823
I've seen!

262
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,681
Dad!

263
00:42:19,725 --> 00:42:22,610
No!

264
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:30,611
Wait!

265
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,001
This strong
but God transcends!

266
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,699
God is strong!

267
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:24,082
I warn you... I warn you!

268
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:28,878
werewolf you're still alive!

269
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:33,809
Discover... Discover!

270
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,464
Find it.

271
00:43:41,563 --> 00:43:43,378
There!

272
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:23,246
- You can not escape me!
- God! You can talk! How?

273
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:28,268
I understand.
It is important, Valerie.

274
00:44:30,724 --> 00:44:32,918
What are you doing?

275
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:41,612
Man's eyes... Dark brown.

276
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:48,134
I know you well.
Leaves you dream for this village.

277
00:44:48,135 --> 00:44:53,306
Let me take you with me.
We both are the same.

278
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:56,536
No. Not at all like you.
You murderer and.

279
00:44:56,537 --> 00:44:59,918
And you murderers Sheet, is not it?

280
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:04,830
What happened to the rabbit,
Valerie?

281
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:11,446
- I killed.
- I know. Come with me!

282
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,617
No.

283
00:45:12,618 --> 00:45:17,037
Then the road will bathe in the blood,
from him.

284
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:20,292
Come on!

285
00:45:20,293 --> 00:45:24,734
- Fr Solomon will stop.
- You die, like everyone else.

286
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:29,279
I will come back after you
bloody month to pass up.

287
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,993
Pull!

288
00:45:50,305 --> 00:45:53,351
- Did you talk to a wolf!
- He speaks to us.

289
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:56,715
Mara. Wait, you talking to?

290
00:45:56,716 --> 00:46:00,270
I would call a witch.
Do not tell anyone.

291
00:46:01,814 --> 00:46:03,490
Join the Holy Land.

292
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:05,540
- You can find my brother.
- And the family!

293
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:10,202
No one leaves until sunrise!
For your safety!

294
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:37,866
I was wrong
when we doubt you, Father.

295
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:43,872
I've never seen
animals are so strong.

296
00:46:43,873 --> 00:46:48,852
Coming from a line of safe blood
long and uninterrupted.

297
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:54,632
Each generation is more powerful
than before.

298
00:46:55,732 --> 00:47:00,914
- You find it in human form.
- How? It can be anyone.

299
00:47:00,915 --> 00:47:06,404
Congratulations na so reckless.
Look everywhere.

300
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:10,360
Check the signs!

301
00:47:11,374 --> 00:47:14,493
Isolation...

302
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,910
Witch...

303
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:18,977
Occult art...

304
00:47:19,193 --> 00:47:21,248
Abnormal behavior...

305
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:23,304
The smell...

306
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:27,318
Your house will be robbed!

307
00:47:27,353 --> 00:47:29,867
You will be exposed to confidential data!

308
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:34,224
If you are not guilty,
what do you do your homework,

309
00:47:35,337 --> 00:47:37,978
But if you're guilty...

310
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:44,100
... I swear in the name of the mighty God
that you will be corrupted and i.

311
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:49,967
He's alive!

312
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,999
Bring me water! Hurry!

313
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:09,946
This bloody month, he was entitled to... and

314
00:48:09,981 --> 00:48:12,103
He's my brother!

315
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:37,907
A human bite as... is the one who cursed!

316
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:16,324
Ah Valerie opened the door

317
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:23,514
We are all in danger.
Must go now!

318
00:49:23,936 --> 00:49:25,667
Come with me!

319
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:31,044
Come with me...

320
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,517
<i>Come with me...</i>

321
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:42,295
Get your things.
Must go now!

322
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:48,482
- I can not go with you, Peter.
- Why?

323
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:52,631
Sorry...

324
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:17,706
- What happened?
- He fell asleep.

325
00:50:17,984 --> 00:50:20,923
A and a. ..

326
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:24,943
Wolf was only scratched.
Not the floor biting.

327
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:28,396
Take his head, Valerie.

328
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:35,100
Here, drink this drãguþo,.
This will help you sleep.

329
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:49,131
Sleep...

330
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:05,051
What happened, darling?

331
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:07,689
What?

332
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,853
Wolf...

333
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:12,068
He said...

334
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,080
And you have to understand it?

335
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,010
Equally clear
how you understand yourself.

336
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:27,049
Did you ever tell anyone about it?

337
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,890
Only Roxanne,
but will remain confidential.

338
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,394
No, I do not want
to talk about things like this.

339
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:36,489
He chose not to kill you...

340
00:51:36,853 --> 00:51:39,413
I think I want in life.

341
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,344
<i>There...</i>

342
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:58,084
I will go without a dressing.

343
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:07,286
You need to bring clean water.

344
00:52:14,462 --> 00:52:18,632
- Claude returned to the house?
- Did not see anyone.

345
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:26,244
Entering the house, now!

346
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:37,155
I saw you together with Peter.

347
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:41,687
I know I do not want me...
how it was with him.

348
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,781
Do not force you to
You to get married.

349
00:52:51,217 --> 00:52:54,154
A to cancel the engagement.

350
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:12,770
Sorry, Henry.

351
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,095
Solomon's father, I found someone
hiding in the tunnel!

352
00:53:30,015 --> 00:53:31,814
Hurry!

353
00:53:38,399 --> 00:53:40,019
He's my brother!

354
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,866
Give him down! I want to interrogate!

355
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,460
That's Wolf!

356
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:45,019
Look at him!

357
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:47,825
Speak with a strange, strange behavior.

358
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,105
Wake up! Now!

359
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,316
He did not do anything!

360
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:56,088
That's proof
have studied the occult arts!

361
00:53:56,123 --> 00:53:57,313
It's a witch!

362
00:53:57,348 --> 00:54:01,376
- I know!
- And I think my wife knows.

363
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:05,253
You never know
en state why a person.

364
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:06,869
Legaþi it!

365
00:54:34,632 --> 00:54:37,038
Tell me the name Wolf.

366
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:44,903
Tell me... name...

367
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:47,942
Say my name!

368
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:53,975
No, no!

369
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:05,727
The Romans created something like.

370
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:11,410
An intelligent system
to extract the truth.

371
00:55:11,445 --> 00:55:15,121
How to tell you his name?
The boy was almost unable to speak.

372
00:55:15,156 --> 00:55:20,635
Listen to him and how I love to sing
for Satan...

373
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,758
We do this for the good of all.

374
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:26,694
Where "good" in all this?

375
00:55:30,508 --> 00:55:34,945
I killed my wife
to protect my own child.

376
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,258
Receive our method
God is sometimes not perfect.

377
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:44,000
You do well to suporþi all.

378
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,186
Who says it's important?

379
00:56:16,513 --> 00:56:20,406
I came to negotiate
My sister release.

380
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:29,377
- Silver Nail...
-... To kill the werewolf.

381
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,918
- Release It!
- Please, I...

382
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:38,572
We can offer more than money.

383
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:56,733
Come back...

384
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,400
That's enough.

385
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:07,683
Wait, please!
I got nothing.

386
00:57:09,169 --> 00:57:13,326
If cruþaþi life
I can tell you the name of witches.

387
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:26,889
This is...
really worth something.

388
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,871
Tell them why and they told me too.

389
00:57:38,662 --> 00:57:41,224
It can climb trees MoD of the most high ratings.

390
00:57:41,259 --> 00:57:43,467
It's faster than any girl.

391
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,657
Wearing a red robe.

392
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:46,828
Satan can not...

393
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,765
What makes sense... I've done and that coat.

394
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,942
- Quiet you!
- Continue...

395
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:55,798
Maybe talk to the werewolves...

396
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:02,593
I see myself.

397
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:11,955
- Negi all this?
- No, do not deny anything.

398
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:20,033
About... what are you talking about?

399
00:58:20,068 --> 00:58:23,944
He promised to leave Daggerhorn
if one was with him.

400
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:31,938
Wolf someone in this village
and want you, Valerie.

401
00:58:33,956 --> 00:58:36,874
You know who that is?

402
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:40,972
In your place, and I think very good.

403
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,329
Tell me...

404
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,248
Tell me who e. ..

405
00:58:49,283 --> 00:58:52,456
Give me a name...

406
00:58:56,055 --> 00:58:59,579
One wanted it, not you.

407
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:03,317
If you want to save you,
give him what he wants

408
00:59:03,614 --> 00:59:06,446
We can not give Wolf!
This is a human sacrifice.

409
00:59:06,481 --> 00:59:09,282
All the sacrifices I make.

410
00:59:09,317 --> 00:59:13,629
The trial ended,
Turn in your home.

411
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,628
I was told to go home! All!

412
00:59:21,347 --> 00:59:24,488
- I think ferent from it.
- Continue!

413
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,636
Hold to it...

414
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:32,536
Try and think about your rational.

415
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:39,458
Are you going to try to save him?

416
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,306
- You will help you and me.
- I am not so desperate.

417
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,524
No dirt?

418
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,027
And what's your plan?

419
00:59:51,062 --> 00:59:53,495
I do not think you have a plan.

420
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:56,537
You have seen people lock.

421
00:59:56,572 --> 00:59:58,990
I shop and tools.

422
00:59:59,025 --> 01:00:00,898
You need me.

423
01:00:01,741 --> 01:00:04,271
Well, well...

424
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,803
But if you wolf
I'll chop off his head.

425
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,397
And I'll get and do the same.

426
01:00:12,432 --> 01:00:15,162
Fair enough.

427
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,876
Where's my brother?

428
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,147
My father told me Solomon
I give you that.

429
01:00:26,182 --> 01:00:27,992
I let him go.

430
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:16,314
Grandma...

431
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:24,190
Bread and blankets.
Do you need anything else?

432
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:32,998
You do not want to use the knife.
We must find the Wolf...

433
01:01:33,033 --> 01:01:34,495
... To the west.

434
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,092
Listen to me, Wolf wants you.

435
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,655
But, I first killed his brother Thi.

436
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,065
No, I do not know.

437
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:45,308
Lucy fell in love with Henry.

438
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:50,923
When he learned my involvement,
Wolf offered a single.

439
01:01:51,856 --> 01:01:54,754
There...
Lucy would never do something like this.

440
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:55,732
That from time to time.

441
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:59,443
Henry will answer.

442
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:04,780
Make sure that you will receive.

443
01:02:26,502 --> 01:02:29,035
Cesa...

444
01:02:30,343 --> 01:02:34,128
I will save my child.
And, then I would take her to wife.

445
01:02:34,163 --> 01:02:37,534
He wants your blessing,
But I will and without.

446
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:43,758
How can I help?

447
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,065
- I was close.
- I.

448
01:02:58,556 --> 01:03:00,561
Hi, Henry.

449
01:03:00,596 --> 01:03:02,987
- Thi I brought biscuits.
- Thank you.

450
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:10,896
I want to tell you thank you
You take that attitude, this morning.

451
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:14,096
Sampled some biscuits.

452
01:03:18,471 --> 01:03:21,910
- You have shown great courage.
- I say what I feel.

453
01:03:22,684 --> 01:03:30,056
I want to know that you do not have obligations
Valerie defend it.

454
01:03:30,535 --> 01:03:32,594
You are no longer engaged to him.

455
01:03:32,629 --> 01:03:37,023
If someone is in love,
does not mean they no longer hold it.

456
01:03:37,058 --> 01:03:40,347
I feel that the standby and Lucy
about you.

457
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:44,066
- Just destroy it with Picasa.
- It's more than that.

458
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:46,724
I think everything should be done
for you.

459
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:49,965
They may have met your
and full-moon night,

460
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,148
if you have something called the standby.

461
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,513
Why is this?

462
01:04:04,913 --> 01:04:08,761
You think I'm the wolf?
Accused me of murder?

463
01:04:09,006 --> 01:04:12,903
Not accusing you of anything.

464
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:16,621
What I want is to get the truth.

465
01:04:18,444 --> 01:04:21,209
You...

466
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:25,186
God, you are...
You could smell.

467
01:04:25,221 --> 01:04:27,347
And that smell?

468
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:30,449
The night my father died,
I smell Wolf.

469
01:04:30,484 --> 01:04:32,366
There was the smell of musk.

470
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,331
And the smell on you now.

471
01:04:35,366 --> 01:04:38,255
Why are you in cãbãnuþa so
alone?

472
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:42,650
In the middle of the night...
Lucy the night she died?

473
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:45,533
You do not know, right?

474
01:04:49,758 --> 01:04:51,880
I know what you're doing.

475
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:56,498
I will leave you
blame me.

476
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,401
You have to live with us.

477
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:04,757
I have done nothing.

478
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:06,446
But the size of security.

479
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:09,969
Fr Solomon did not want problems
witch family.

480
01:06:18,357 --> 01:06:21,768
It's time to let you wrap the chicken.

481
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,280
Valerie!

482
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:49,250
We do everything possible
to protect you.

483
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:51,889
- You and Lucy.
- I know, Dad.

484
01:06:54,172 --> 01:06:57,611
You have taught us to be strong.

485
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:16,458
<i>Fr Solomon finds a mask
for public humility.</i>

486
01:07:16,895 --> 01:07:19,359
<i>Up and watching my friends run.</i>

487
01:07:19,394 --> 01:07:21,070
<i>Judge me...</i>

488
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:27,237
<i>If you correctly?
Wolf might know something I do not know.</i>

489
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:30,797
<i>There may be
the dark side in me.</i>

490
01:07:30,832 --> 01:07:33,260
Plecaþi all know that house!

491
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:48,112
Sorry, Valerie.
I want to happen something like this.

492
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:52,010
Blessed, my dear.

493
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:03,676
Valerie? I, Prudence.

494
01:08:04,397 --> 01:08:07,203
Roxanne wanted to tell you
that I'm really sorry.

495
01:08:07,238 --> 01:08:09,351
He said things
and just to save his brother.

496
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:13,300
- I know. Tell him you forgive.
- Sure.

497
01:08:14,096 --> 01:08:16,737
I want to tell you...

498
01:08:17,402 --> 01:08:20,597
- Do not know what I mean.
- No need to say anything.

499
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,318
But I want to say something...

500
01:08:24,175 --> 01:08:26,600
I want to know that...

501
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:31,511
Maybe you are tricked a Roxanne,
But you're not my Paca and me.

502
01:08:32,428 --> 01:08:34,253
You tricked me enough.

503
01:08:34,288 --> 01:08:36,503
You're always too good...

504
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:39,073
Too good...

505
01:08:40,002 --> 01:08:41,803
Too perfect!

506
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,663
We have a cheat!

507
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:51,042
Now... you will meriþi raw.

508
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:55,022
Prudence, I think you should go.

509
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:58,988
Yes...
I will not take much longer...

510
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:04,386
The wolf is coming...

511
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:11,038
<i>Wolf lives here.</i>

512
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:14,490
<i>It's your neighbor. This is your friend.
Maybe his wife.</i>

513
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,706
<i>How nice...</i>

514
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:18,586
<i>It makes me want to eat...</i>

515
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,588
<i>You will be happy!</i>

516
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,555
<i>Taking human form!</i>

517
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:42,169
You know how to kill tigers
Auguste parents?

518
01:09:46,135 --> 01:09:49,576
Îþi best sacrificial goat...

519
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,523
And tepþi standby...

520
01:10:48,395 --> 01:10:50,397
Fire!

521
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,205
Seek Move!

522
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:01,645
Stop!

523
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,742
This will put you out of here.

524
01:11:56,397 --> 01:11:58,066
Do not move.

525
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:20,094
Do not Join!
A take fire.

526
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:24,127
- If that does not Wolf...
- Help a witch!

527
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,131
Fire!

528
01:12:37,408 --> 01:12:39,493
Run!

529
01:12:53,783 --> 01:12:55,467
Who started the fire!

530
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:58,094
Turn it up! In the elephant!

531
01:12:58,129 --> 01:13:01,424
Go!
Wizards escape!

532
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:23,328
Come here!

533
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:25,162
Find this witch!

534
01:13:28,618 --> 01:13:31,020
Come on, Peter was waiting for us with horses.

535
01:13:36,488 --> 01:13:39,100
Valerie!

536
01:13:40,474 --> 01:13:43,613
Valerie!

537
01:13:48,534 --> 01:13:52,159
- Peter Where?
- I do not know.

538
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:55,346
He said he would be here.

539
01:13:55,913 --> 01:14:00,350
If not, I'll take you there.

540
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,381
<i>Let me take you there...</i>

541
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:09,445
You think I'm the wolf?

542
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:12,497
Find this witch!

543
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:13,912
Come on, hurry.

544
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:23,445
Go!

545
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,942
We have to go...

546
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:31,396
Church!
Wolves can not enter the holy land.

547
01:14:44,653 --> 01:14:46,788
I heard something.

548
01:14:51,478 --> 01:14:53,258
There!

549
01:15:09,947 --> 01:15:12,729
- Henry!
- Valerie, go!

550
01:15:12,764 --> 01:15:14,918
Do not get out of here.

551
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,850
Seeking asylum!

552
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:27,729
It's not you in the holy land!

553
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:30,729
This...

554
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:34,214
... I belong to me.

555
01:15:55,526 --> 01:15:58,469
Do you want in life?

556
01:15:59,062 --> 01:16:00,268
Shoot and how it is!

557
01:16:14,075 --> 01:16:16,565
Valerie...

558
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:21,700
If you pass beyond the gate
to destroy the entire village.

559
01:16:21,735 --> 01:16:25,565
Come with me
before sunrise.

560
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,731
What is your decision?

561
01:16:32,293 --> 01:16:34,827
I would not give permission
to destroy my house.

562
01:16:37,253 --> 01:16:38,770
"I'll Come to You.

563
01:16:38,805 --> 01:16:40,252
No! Valerie!

564
01:16:40,287 --> 01:16:42,652
Only if you promise them to, and in peace.

565
01:16:42,687 --> 01:16:45,609
No! You do not accept the sacrifice
for us.

566
01:16:47,797 --> 01:16:49,034
I also do not.

567
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:51,922
Also not too! We stand by Valerie
until the end.

568
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,327
You can not hide from me.

569
01:17:10,286 --> 01:17:13,546
Witch I defend it!

570
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:26,595
When the moon is bleeding,
bite as the condemned man.

571
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:29,953
My kids are moving the bite of a wolf.

572
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,324
My brother...

573
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:39,551
... And she had no children.

574
01:17:39,586 --> 01:17:43,267
I just want
is to help.

575
01:17:44,382 --> 01:17:47,411
To protect themselves from the darkness.

576
01:18:05,603 --> 01:18:08,210
When the month of bloody...

577
01:18:09,111 --> 01:18:11,645
... As a man bites a man cursed.

578
01:18:27,304 --> 01:18:29,192
Where is Peter?

579
01:18:30,675 --> 01:18:33,105
Where is Peter?

580
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:10,428
Grandma, what big eyes you...

581
01:19:10,802 --> 01:19:15,295
Want to see you better, honey...

582
01:19:20,326 --> 01:19:24,334
Grandma, what big ears you...

583
01:19:24,836 --> 01:19:29,179
So you hear better, my dear...

584
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:32,877
What big teeth you have...

585
01:19:32,912 --> 01:19:38,166
Like eating better,
My dear...

586
01:19:55,196 --> 01:19:59,152
Valerie, what you get out of bed?

587
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:03,995
I'm very worried.

588
01:20:10,358 --> 01:20:12,149
Looks much better.

589
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:22,682
- Where are you going?
- In Grandma.

590
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:25,355
I thought it was in danger.

591
01:21:01,907 --> 01:21:05,994
Wolf left in search
before the storm to cover his tracks.

592
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:09,490
'Will Be human again
and in the end, we will kill him.

593
01:21:10,848 --> 01:21:13,300
- I have...
- What?

594
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:14,795
Tell me.

595
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:17,498
Peter, still available.

596
01:21:18,326 --> 01:21:20,827
'Will Do what it takes.

597
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:24,812
Please be careful.

598
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,097
Valerie!

599
01:22:14,344 --> 01:22:17,159
Thank God you're right!

600
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,685
Where have you been?

601
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,458
Throughout the night I was stuck
in the animal.

602
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:30,942
Finally, I managed to escape.

603
01:22:31,298 --> 01:22:32,997
Stay away from me.

604
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,969
What about Valerie? Do not believe me?

605
01:22:37,846 --> 01:22:40,438
I'll hurt you.

606
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,813
I do not.

607
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:49,100
Please, no!

608
01:23:19,364 --> 01:23:21,722
Grandma?

609
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,123
Grandma, are you okay?

610
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:32,410
I have nightmares.

611
01:23:34,302 --> 01:23:38,255
I'm fine. I've just woken up.

612
01:23:38,912 --> 01:23:41,663
I have soup, when you get hungry.

613
01:23:48,276 --> 01:23:51,351
- I think Wolf out.
- It's okay, honey.

614
01:23:51,386 --> 01:23:53,603
Here we are safe.

615
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:55,253
Take and eat.

616
01:23:55,288 --> 01:23:58,963
Remember: "All pain disappears
once with the work rolls. "

617
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:05,867
So, take and eat, dear.

618
01:24:05,902 --> 01:24:08,196
Why eat here?

619
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:24,023
Dad, what are you doing here?

620
01:24:24,883 --> 01:24:26,904
Where Grandma?

621
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:29,413
I had no choice.

622
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:36,382
Finally, and realize...
am.

623
01:24:45,134 --> 01:24:47,477
How could you do something like that?

624
01:24:47,512 --> 01:24:49,040
Sit.

625
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:51,229
Sit!

626
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,656
Oh, Valerie...

627
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:00,351
I hurt so much.

628
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:02,940
I thank you a lot less
merit.

629
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:09,700
I decided to go... city.

630
01:25:15,884 --> 01:25:18,604
There is a hunting area
rich.

631
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,602
Why not go all at once?

632
01:25:20,637 --> 01:25:23,636
Because I love you,
My daughter.

633
01:25:23,856 --> 01:25:25,911
I want to come with me.

634
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:28,634
- And have a bloody tepþi Month.
- Yes.

635
01:25:28,669 --> 01:25:33,822
By birth, my gift will arrive
First, the largest face.

636
01:25:33,857 --> 01:25:36,244
A so I forged the letter.

637
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,734
But when I try to talk to him...

638
01:25:39,769 --> 01:25:41,860
<i>Henry did not come, Lucy.</i>

639
01:25:43,316 --> 01:25:46,262
... I do not understand.

640
01:25:46,737 --> 01:25:48,859
Any offspring of mine
werewolf with my blood,

641
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,689
I'll understand.

642
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:54,232
Then I realized.

643
01:25:54,997 --> 01:25:58,652
Lucy had no way to be my son.
You are my mother's mind.

644
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:01,185
But you and cut, right?

645
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:06,501
Atâþia After years in which I was careful
I lost control.

646
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:09,358
I apologize to Lucy.

647
01:26:09,393 --> 01:26:11,246
You have to take revenge her mother.

648
01:26:12,296 --> 01:26:14,096
And on her lover.

649
01:26:19,044 --> 01:26:21,389
That night
Henry Wolf snorted.

650
01:26:22,547 --> 01:26:24,857
Yesterday the smell anymore .

651
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,950
He thinks that it smells of your grandmother.

652
01:26:31,847 --> 01:26:34,875
But throughout life, he lived
smell.

653
01:26:39,513 --> 01:26:42,162
You see, and my father is a werewolf.

654
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,499
Still in the clothes smell.

655
01:26:47,004 --> 01:26:50,203
My mother did not know what that means...

656
01:26:51,154 --> 01:26:53,671

This is the last day of bleeding.

658
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:03,939
This was enough to bite
floor and I'll be me.

659
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:10,282
Valerie, ikut aku.
Ini adalah hari terakhir bulan berdarah.

660
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:14,518
Hal ini cukup untuk gigitan lantai
dan aku akan menjadi diriku.

661
01:27:14,789 --> 01:27:17,642
No you do what you do.

you can be stronger than me. </ P> Think about yourself.

666
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:35,729
God must exist, because you're Satan
.

667
01:27:35,974 --> 01:27:40,990
And you're the child of Satan.

668
01:27:42,644 --> 01:27:46,706
There is a timer and have înfrico
when it is light.

669
01:27:47,331 --> 01:27:49,658
How do you know?

670
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,644

673
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:16,070
Peter... Dapatkan saya keluar dari sini.

674
01:29:25,668 --> 01:29:27,992
Tapi aku menggigit.

675
01:29:34,522 --> 01:29:37,261
Ketika bulan naik...

676
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:40,853

677
01:29:43,464 --> 01:29:45,600

No one needs to know about your father

687
01:31:00,801 --> 01:31:04,400
I will hang because you princess Wolf.
