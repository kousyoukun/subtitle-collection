00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,670
很久以前  在古代中国
Long ago, a mythic battle between good and evil

3
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,550
发生了一场神话般的正邪之战
played out in ancient China.

4
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,170
内战的战火席卷了整个国家
The country was torn by civil war,

5
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,870
各诸侯国为了土地和权力征战不断
with many kingdoms struggling for land and power.

6
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:00,280
其中有一个王更野心勃勃 想要通过武力一统天下成为皇帝
But one king had a ruthless ambition to make himself emperor by the sword.

7
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,480
我要把它连成万里  连一个…

8
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,600
都退下
Leave me.

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,220
准备开战!
Prepare for war!

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,890
其他诸侯国唯恐被他吞并
NARRATOR... The other rulers hired assassins to kill the King

11
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,000
派出杀手刺杀他
before he could conquer them all.

12
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,100
不用!朕没事
Stop! I am not harmed.

13
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
今晚进攻!
We attack tonight!

14
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,930
他的军队一路战胜了一个又一个诸侯国
NARRATOR... Kingdom by kingdom, his army swept away everything in its path,

15
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,250
胆敢违抗他的人都没好下场
and anyone who resisted met a terrible fate.

16
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,750
最后整个国家都是他的
The country was his.

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,410
他成了一切万物的统治者
He was now Emperor of All Under Heaven.

18
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,410
战败的敌人都成了他的奴隶 为他建造万里长城
He enslaved his conquered enemies and forced them to build his Great Wall.

19
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,820
一旦他们死了或病了  就直接掩埋在城墙下
When they were dead or useless, he had them buried beneath it.

20
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,290
方士教会了皇帝如何掌握五行
The Emperor's mystics taught him mastery over the five elements,

21
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,970
火 水 土 木 金
fire, water, earth, wood and metal.

22
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,790
他的力量无限壮大
His power seemed without limit.

23
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,790
成为了万人的主宰
He was master of millions,

24
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,060
然而就如最低贱的贱民一样  他渐渐变老
but like the lowliest peasant, he could not stop growing old.

25
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,040
朕  要寻找永生之道
I have too much to do for one lifetime.

26
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,520
他要击败他的最后一个敌人  死亡
NARRATOR... He needed to defeat his last enemy, death itself.

27
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,690
直到有一天  他听到传闻
One day, news came of a powerful witch

28
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,320
一个道姑知道长生不老的秘方
who was rumoured to know the secret to eternal life.

29
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,040
于是他命令自己的老朋友 忠实的部下明将军去找这个道姑
He ordered General Ming, his oldest friend and trusted ally, to find her.

30
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,300
这个道姑名叫紫苑
The witch was named Zi Yuan,

31
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,960
她跟明将军所想的不一样
and she was nothing like the General expected.

32
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,620
参见陛下…
Your Majesty...

33
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,350
平身
Rise up.

34
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,790
皇上所求  奴婢不知如何解答…
I do not possess the secret of immortality, my Lord...

35
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,230
…却知答案藏于何处
...but I know where to find it.

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,720
将军…
General...

37
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,990
此女
No man is to touch her.

38
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,930
非朕莫属
She is mine.

39
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,350
在西面边陲有一座吐鲁番寺庙
NARRATOR... On the western border stood the Monastery of Turfan.

40
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,430
这是古代藏书最多的地方
There was housed the greatest library in the ancient world,

41
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,130
紫苑相信不老的秘方就藏于此
and Zi Yuan was sure the secret to eternal life was here.

42
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,900
此乃开锁之物
This is a key.

43
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,320
这是一块失传已久的甲骨
NARRATOR... It was the long lost oracle bones,

44
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,740
记载了古时的所有秘密
a collection of all the mystical secrets of the ancient world.

45
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,760
皇帝所要的答案就在里面 其中还隐藏了其他超凡的秘密
The Emperor's answer was here along with other magic beyond imagining.

46
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,840
朕甚悦
You have served me well.

47
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,670
汝何所求  朕皆赐之
I will grant you anything you desire.

48
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,790
愿与郭明共渡余生
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

49
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,620
准
Of course.

50
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,230
念
Read.

51
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,660
她用皇帝听不懂的梵语念诵着
NARRATOR... She cast the spell in Sanskrit,

52
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,190
这是一种古老语言
an ancient language that the Emperor did not understand.

53
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,340
此语朕虽不解
I feel your spell working.

54
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,590
然觉于气  流行于筋络之间
I am now immortal.

55
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,840
朕要你见一个人
Come, I want to show you something.

56
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,580
郭郎

57
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,090
为朕的皇后  可饶其不死
Become my queen and I will let him live.

58
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,320
从其令  卿之命为重
Do what he says! Save yourself!

59
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,610
你必食言
You will never keep your word.

60
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,260
正是
You are right.

61
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,260
与郭明地府相见吧
Now, join General Ming in hell.

62
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,430
你竟敢施法于朕

63
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,250
你对朕做了什么
What did you do to me?

64
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,370
咒汝及汝之徒!
I cursed you and your army.

65
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,120
快护驾!
Surround the Palace!

66
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,030
皇上出事了!
The Emperor is in trouble!

67
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,570
咒语绝对不能解除
NARRATOR... The curse must never be lifted,

68
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,150
否则皇帝会重返人间  奴役众人
or the Emperor will rise again to enslave all of mankind.

69
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,470
那天来临时  也将是世界末日
On that dark day, there will be nothing and no one to save us.

70
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,710
木乃伊 龙帝之墓

71
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,960
你可以跑  但你无处可藏
You can run, but you can't hide.

72
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,380
一点钟方向
One o'clock.

73
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,580
英国牛津郡  1946年
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND

74
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,960
十点钟  一点钟  十点钟  一…
Ten o'clock, one o'clock. Ten o'clock, one...

75
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,360
这就是成人该做的?
And this is something for grown men to do?

76
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,900
快点
Come on.

77
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,220
靠这了
Bite on this.

78
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,510
伊芙  我回来了!
Evy, I'm home!

79
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,630
奥康纳夫人去读书会了  先生 她会回来吃晚饭
Mrs O'Connell is at her book reading, sir. She'll be home for dinner.

80
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,870
哦  好的  非常好  正好我钓了鱼
Oh, right. Well, that's great, 'cause we're having fish.

81
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,460
你没想到我会钓到  是吧?
You didn't think I'd catch anything, did you?

82
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,490
我对你绝对有信心  先生
I had the utmost confidence, sir.

83
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,360
你的脖子上有个鱼钩  先生 要我帮你去拿钢丝钳吗?
JAMESON: There's a hook in your neck, sir. Shall I fetch the wire cutters?

84
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,380
里克…退后!跟着我! 快!快!快!快!
RICK... Fall back! Follow me! Move! Move! Move! Move!

85
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,900
"最后安全登上飞艇  木乃伊终于被打败了
EVELYN..."Now safely aboard the airship with the mummy finally vanquished,

86

伦敦
LONDON

87
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,770
"达什将斯嘉丽拥入怀中
"Dash swept Scarlet into his arms.

88
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,380
‘哦  天哪  斯嘉丽  我以为失去你了’ ‘曾有一时  确实如此‘
"'Oh, God, Scarlet, I thought I'd lost you.' 'For a moment there, you did.'

89
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,270
"沐浴在金色阳光下
"Bathed in rays of golden sunlight,

90
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,430
"我们的英雄们激情拥吻庆祝着重逢
"our heroes sealed their reunion with a kiss of timeless passion,

91
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,460
"他们的爱比以往更深更真"
"their love deeper and truer than ever."

92
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,000
奥康纳夫人  我们都非常好奇
Mrs O'Connell, we're all dying to know,

93
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,990
斯嘉丽·奥凯弗这个角色的原形真的是你吗?
is the Scarlet O'Keefe character really based on you?

94
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,500
老实说  她和我是截然不同的人
Honestly, I can say she's a completely different person.

95
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,580
- 还有问题吗? - 奥康纳夫人…
- Any more questions? - WO Mrs O'Connell...

96
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,610
奥康纳夫人  你如今的生活与战前一样精彩吗?
Mrs O'Connell, is your life today as exciting as it was before the war?

97
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,080
但愿我的生活能和那时一样精彩
I wish my life were that exciting now.

98
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,570
这个系列还会出新书吗?
Will there be another book in the series?

99
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,630
会有大团圆结局吗?
WOMAN 2: Do you believe in happy endings?

100
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,810
这样不是很幸福吗?
Isn't this blissful?

101
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,810
一起在家吃饭
Dinner at home.

102
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,510
- 每天晚上 - 每天晚上
- Every night. - Every night.

103
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,120
- 为了退休干杯 - 希望永远这么幸福
- Here's to retirement. - May we stay this happy forever.

104
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
还是没有亚历克斯的信 上个月我给他寄了3封
Still no letter from Alex. I've sent him three in the last month.

105
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,550
是嘛  你还想怎么样?
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

106
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,760
他只有被赶出学校或是缺钱时
The only time we ever hear from that kid

107
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,050
才会寄信回来
is when he's getting kicked out of college or he needs more money.

108
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,570
我相信他正埋头于学习中
I'm sure he's just buried in his studies.

109
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,110
- 不说了  你的读书会怎么样? - 哦  很好  谢谢
- So, how did your book reading go? - Oh, fine. Thank you.

110
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,570
不过他们问起我 "什么时候会出新的木乃伊探险记"
Until they asked me, "When will there be another Mummy adventure?"

111
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,200
你确实向出版社保证过会出第三本
Yeah, but you did promise the publisher a third book.

112
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
我知道
I know.

113
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,780
可我整晚盯着白纸  脑子一片空白
But I spend my nights staring at a blank page, completely blocked.

114
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:37,020
那我们不吃了  上楼去
We could skip dinner, and I could

115
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,800
我会试着启发你
attempt to inspire you upstairs.

116
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,310
哦  你真好  亲爱的
Oh, that's so sweet of you, darling.

117
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,420
可我还是想坐在打字机前  直到灵感涌现
But I'm going to sit at that typewriter until something exciting comes out.

118
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,130
谢谢
Thank you.

119
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,920
鲑鱼  太棒了
Trout. How lovely!

120
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,410
很高兴你找到个不用枪的爱好
I'm so happy you found a hobby that doesn't involve guns.

121
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,900
中国宁夏省
NINGXIA PROVINCE, CHINA

122
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,100
一定能找到
Don't worry, we'll find the entrance today.

123
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,780
李彤  午饭?
Li Tung, what's for lunch?

124
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,230
热的汤
Noodle soup.

125
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,140
哦  好好
Very good.

126
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,300
很好  威尔逊回来了
ALEX: Good. Wilson's back.

127
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,560
你晚了好几天  教授
You're a couple days late, Professor.

128
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,140
我还以为你碰上抢劫了
I was beginning to think you'd run into bandits.

129
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,220
哦  我亲爱的朋友  谢谢你的关心
Oh, my dear fellow, thank you for the concern.

130
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,010
- 你渴吗? - 哦  是的
- Are you thirsty? - Oh, yes, please.

131
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,540
- 给你 - 谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

132
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,340
知道吗  看见你站在那
You know, when I saw you standing up there,

133
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,590
我还以为是你父亲
I thought I was looking at your father.

134
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,420
不愧是里克·奥康纳的儿子
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.

135
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,340
是啊  真希望从今以后 人们会称呼他亚历克斯·奥康纳的父亲
Yeah, well, hopefully after today, he'll be known as Alex O'Connell's father.

136
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,130
多有力的脸啊!
What a powerful face!

137
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,560
当我告诉博物馆的同事  你发现了兵马俑时
When I told my colleagues at the museum that you had discovered the Colossus,

138
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,830
他们非常震惊
they were thrilled.

139
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,120
- 呃  但是… - 我知道
- Yes, however... - I know.

140
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,290
什么时候我能进那个墓穴?
When am I gonna get in that tomb?

141
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,410
别为那些事烦心了
Don't let the buggers get you down.

142
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,910
是你发现了本布里奇的日记
It was you that discovered the Bembridge journal,

143
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,490
有了它  你很快会找到龙帝
and with it, you'll discover the Emperor.

144
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,730
- 我对你绝对有信心  亚历克斯 - 谢谢你  教授
- I have complete faith in you, Alex. - Thank you, Professor.

145
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,140
谢谢你相信我
Thanks for believing in me.

146
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,390
找到了!找到了!找到了!
We found it! We found the door!

147
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,430
讨厌的木乃伊
Bad Mummy.

148
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,340
是啊
Yeah.

149
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,800
可憎的木乃伊?
Vile Mummy?

150
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,350
不  受诅咒的木乃伊!
No. Cursed Mummy!

151
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,540
神秘的木乃伊
Mysterious Mummy.

152
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,920
邪恶的木乃伊
Malignant Mummy.

153
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,370
受死吧!
Prepare to die!

154
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,580
拿命来!
Take that!

155
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,270
里克!
Rick!

156
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,070
亲爱的  你在哪?
Darling, where are you?

157
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,930
我等着灵感涌现呢
I'm ready to be inspired.

158
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,270
还记得那次木乃伊把我捆住吗?
Do you remember the time the mummy had me tied down?

159
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,310
然后你来救我  切断了…
And you came to save me and you cut...

160
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,640
不!你扯断了绳子
No! You tore open the ropes is what you did,

161
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,960
就在他插入…
just as he was about to plunge his...

162
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,000
哦  见鬼
Oh, rats.

163
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,100
小心!
Watch out!

164
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,540
- 龙帝不欢迎客人 - 是啊
- Emperor didn't want any houseguests. - Yeah.

165
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,830
注意!不要走散了
Stay together.

166
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,160
科林·本布里奇爵士
Sir Colin Bembridge.

167
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,410
哦  啊…
Oh, gee...

168
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,210
70年前他来到这个墓穴
He went searching for this tomb 70 years ago.

169
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,250
他这样子应该是个警告
They left him like this as a warning.

170
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,120
很不幸  这并不是那个能让我们出名的死人
Unfortunately, this is not the dead man that's gonna make us famous.

171
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
继续走
Let's keep moving.

172
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
看啊  亚历克斯
Look at it, Alex.

173
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,120
看啊!
Look at it!

174
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,260
楚旺!
Chu Wah!

175
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,750
救命啊

176
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,790
- 楚旺 - 不  不  不要  不要  不要
- Chu Wah. - No, no, don't, don't, don't.

177
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,580
亚历克斯  亚历克斯  他们死了!走
Alex, Alex, they're dead! Come on.

178
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,790
那里很危险  你比任何人都清楚
This kind of danger goes with the territory. You know that better than anyone.

179
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,560
亚历克斯!
Alex!

180
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,030
- 嗯? - 没事
- Yes? - Okay.

181
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,940
- 是吗? - 是的
- Yes? - Yeah.

182
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,140
好的  好小子  很好  哦  天哪
All right, good chap. Okay. Good chap. Oh, Jesus.

183
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,320
所有的士兵都面向这点
All the warriors are facing in to this point,

184
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,730
- 就像在等待龙帝的命令 - 那么  他又在哪?
- as if awaiting an order from the Emperor. - Well, then, where is he?

185
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,010
听着  你不会以为是某些凶暴的盗墓者
Listen, you don't think some bloody grave robber's

186
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,390
攻击了我们把战利品拿走了吧?
beaten us to the prize, do you?

187
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,180
不  他还在这
No, he's still here.

188
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,880
看  这是风水罗盘
You see, this is a feng shui compass.

189
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,220
是啊  现在  这…
Okay. Now. This...

190
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,210
看  这是真正的北方
Okay, this is true north,

191
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,540
但风水罗盘却指向相反方向
but the feng shui compass is set in the opposite direction.

192
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,710
- 是啊  我们得调整一下 - 对
- All right, we need to realign it. - All right.

193
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,280
- 好吧  我们来 - 好的
- All right, here we go. - All right.

194
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,220
亚历克斯!亚历克斯  回话!
Alex! Alex, speak to me!

195
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,470
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

196
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,130
- 亚历克斯! - 我没事
- Alex! - I'm fine.

197
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,830
告诉我  怎么找到龙帝?
Tell me, have we found the Emperor?

198
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,920
亚历克斯!
Alex!

199
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,550
这是什么?
What is it?

200
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,000
这是自图坦卡门法老墓以来的唯一最大发现!
It's only the greatest find since King Tut!

201
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,380
"若他醒来  将是世界末日"
"If he is awakened, all mortals should despair."

202
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,820
肯定是他!
It's definitely him!

203
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,160
连他的妃子都得陪葬
Even had his concubines buried alive with him.

204
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,030
自私的混蛋
Selfish bastard.

205
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,370
嗨  威尔逊教授  你不下来看看吗?
Hey, Professor Wilson, you want to come down and take a look?

206
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,020
还是你激动地连话都说不了?
Or are you so overwhelmed you can't talk?

207
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,300
威尔逊!
Wilson!

208
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,010
走吧  教授  还有很多事要做
Let's go, Professor. We've got a lot of work to do.

209
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,410
好吧
WILSON: All right.

210
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,620
首先  谨代表
FRY: First of all, I'd just like to say

211
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,960
外交部感谢你们在战时所做的贡献
that the Foreign Office appreciates all that you did during the war.

212
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,780
不过派我来是为了交给你们最后一个任务
But I've been sent to offer you one last assignment.

213
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,470
恐怕我们已经从谍报游戏中退休了 不是吗  亲爱的?
I'm afraid we've retired from the espionage game, haven't we, dear?

214
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,710
是的  我们已经…我们再也不做了 我们退休了
Yeah, we've... We don't do that any more. We're finished.

215
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,550
- 没错 - 完全结束了
- EVELYN: Not at all. - Completely done.

216
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,400
不过我好奇问问  这次任务是什么?
But just out of curiosity, what is the mission anyway?

217
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,220
我们要你们把这个送到上海
We need you to courier this to Shanghai.

218
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,650
- 好漂亮的冰片 - 这是香格里拉之眼
- Nice piece of ice. - It's the Eye of Shangri-La.

219
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,240
传说它能指引通向永生泉之路
If you believe the legend, it points the way to the Pool of Eternal Life.

220
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,490
1940年从中国被盗出
It was smuggled out of China in 1940.

221
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,330
现在政府想要把它归还给上海博物馆
Now, the government would like to return it to the Shanghai Museum

222
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,830
以示对中国人民的友好诚意
as a sign of good faith to the Chinese people.

223
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,830
考虑到你们在这方面的经验 自然就想到了你们
And with your expertise in the field, we naturally thought of you.

224
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,250
哦  这真是我们的荣幸
Oh, we'd be so flattered.

225
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,770
但里克和我在战后互相许诺
But Rick and I, we made a promise to each other after the war

226
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,930
我们会安顿下来
that we would settle down.

227
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,850
- 是的  我们做到了  不是吗?我们… - 我明白
- That's right, yeah, we did, didn't we? We... - I see.

228
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,850
不过我得承认我有点失望
Well, I must admit I am a little disappointed.

229
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,360
战后的中国很危险
Postwar China is very dangerous.

230
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,810
有很多派别
There are a lot of factions that would love

231
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,360
会插足香格里拉之眼
to get their hands on the Eye of Shangri-La.

232
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,480
有可能香格里拉之眼会永远消失
In lesser hands, the Eye could be lost forever.

233
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,530
我们不能让这种事发生  不是吗?
We couldn't let that happen, could we?

234
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,040
是啊  这对世界来说太糟了
No, that could be bad for the world.

235
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,690
- 世界…太可怕了 - 是啊
- The world... Terrible. - Yeah.

236
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,960
你知道  她有个哥哥住在上海
You know, she has a brother who lives in Shanghai.

237
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,880
- 乔纳森! - 是的
- Jonathan! - Yes.

238
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,830
他经营着一家夜总会  我没记错的话
He owns a nightclub, if I'm not mistaken.

239
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,380
我们一直想去看看他  我们可以…
We have been meaning to visit. We could...

240
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,760
- 我们应该…顺便去看他  给他个惊喜
- We should... ...drop in and surprise him.

241
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,510
- 问候一下 - 为什么不呢?
- Say hello. - Why not?

242
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,300
这是否表示 我们能指望你们的最后一次帮忙?
Does this mean we can count on you one last time?

243
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,660
是的
Yes.

244
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,690
中国上海
SHANGHAI, CHINA

245
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,130
1947年春节
CHINESE NEW YEAR, 1947

246
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,190
干杯
There we are.

247
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,590
敬你一杯  公主
Here's to you, Princess.

248
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,340
为了伊姆贺特普  愿天下太平! (第一座金字塔的建筑师与设计者)
And Imhotep. May the bugger actually stay dead.

249
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,010
丁当
Ding-dong.

250
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,600
嘿  能请我喝杯吗?
Hi, can you buy a drink for me?

251
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,990
失陪一下  亚历克斯!亚历克斯!你又来了
Excuse me. Alex! Alex! You're back again.

252
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,530
过来  亚历克斯  请你喝一杯
Come here, Alex. Let me get you a drink.

253
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,520
给这小子来杯温和点的  哈?探险家
Smooth special for the pup, huh? The explorer.

254
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,660
来两杯
Make that two.

255
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,290
抱歉  乔叔叔  但那女人搭讪了我
Sorry, Uncle Jon, but I got a better offer.

256
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,080
不  不  亚历克斯  不  听我说 我怎么能…过来
JONATHAN: No, no, Alex. No, look. Listen, how can I... Come here.

257
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
用考古学的话来说
To put it in archaeological terms,

258
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,260
那是一个埋了许多法老王的墓穴
that's a tomb in which many pharaohs have lain.

259
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,250
现在  听着  听着  为我考虑下  好吗?
Now, listen, listen, just think about me for a moment, all right?

260
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,150
你的发现几天后就会公诸于世
Your discovery will go public in a few days

261
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,140
而你的父母肯定会知道的
and your parents are sure to find out.

262
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,760
对于你的辍学  他们不会高兴的 而且…
They're not gonna be happy you've dropped out of school. And...

263
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,680
放松点  乔叔叔?好吗? 我在这  而他们在很远的地方
Will you relax, Uncle Jon? Okay? I'm here. They're a long way away.

264
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,610
- 亚历克斯… - 我走了  好吗?
- Alex... - Excuse me, okay?

265
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,390
我还要去挖掘
I have some excavation to do.

266
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,900
乔纳森!
Jonathan!

267
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,920
你们来中国了!伊芙  里克
You're in China! Evy. Rick.

268
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,370
你们在…这真是…我甚至没有…
What are you... It's so... I didn't even...

269
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,670
哥哥  见到你真是太好了
Brother, how lovely to see you.

270
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,510
我不知道他在这!
I had no idea he was here!

271
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,450
- 谁在这? - 谁?
- Who was here? - Who?

272
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,500
每次都这样!
This happens every time!

273
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,180
酒吧里的每个人!
Every man in the bar!

274
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,350
- 爸爸? - 亚历克斯?
- Dad? - Alex!

275
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,100
- 我不知道该拿你怎么办! - 他还是个孩子!
I don't know what to do with you! WO He's just a boy!

276
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,520
- 10分钟内我不能离开这房间! - 我不能…走开!去死!
- I can't leave the room for 10 minutes! - I didn't... Go away! Go to hell!

277
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,650
- 我受够了! - 我们去找帅哥吧!
-  I'm sick of it! - Let's go get lover-boy!

278
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,690
我想杀了你  小子!
I'm gonna kill you, kid!

279
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,440
别妄想了  那是我的孩子
Not so fast, that's my kid.

280
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,770
- 疯狗马奎尔? - 跳飞奥康纳
- Mad Dog Maguire? - Ricochet O'Connell.

281
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,370
- 嘿  嘿 - 你在这干嘛?
- Hey, hey. - EVELYN: What are you doing here?

282
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,790
亚历克斯!甜心!你还好吧?
Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?

283
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,320
只是家庭聚会而已
Just a little family get-together, folks.

284
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,240
来吧  我们继续狂欢  音乐!
Come on, let's get back to having a good time. Music!

285
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,370
有多久了?
How long has it been?

286
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,700
1923年  埃及  法国对外志愿军
Egypt, '23. French Foreign Legion.

287
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,630
这家伙可随地降落飞机  你…
This guy could land a plane on anything, you...

288
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,350
- 你为什么在这? - 跳飞  他居然敢泡我的女人
- Why are you here? - Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.

289
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,720
现在  不管是不是你儿子 我都要教训他!
Now, son or no son, I gotta give him a beating!

290
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,130
- 让开  爸爸 - 坐下
- Get out of the way, Dad. - Sit down.

291
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,980
我更希望你能教他点更有用的…
Now as much as I'd really like you to teach him a valuable lesson...

292
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,720
他的妈妈会很伤心  非常伤心
His mother would be upset! Very upset.

293
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,350
你得好好解释下  年轻人
You have a lot of explaining to do, young man.

294
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,650
我有了妻子和孩子
I got a wife now, and a kid.

295
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,900
情况有点不同了  相信你能明白
Things are a little bit different, I'm sure you understand.

296
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,090
- 是的 - 我向你道歉
- Yeah. - Let me make it up to you.

297
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,110
在这看到你我们很惊讶 就是这样
We're just surprised to see you here. That's all.

298
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,610
谁来负责赔偿?
JONATHAN: Who's gonna pay for all this damage?

299
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,990
没事吧?
All right?

300
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,120
我才来了5分钟
I'm not here five minutes,

301
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,080
就帮你收拾烂摊子
and I'm already pulling your fanny out of the fire.

302
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,200
你必须回学校去
You're going back to college.

303
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,770
你觉得可能吗  爸爸?
How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?

304
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,460
你们俩突然出现  到底要干什么?
You two show up, tell me what to do?

305
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,000
不  我们一家人应该坐下好好谈谈
No. But we should sit down and discuss this like a family.

306
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,880
请原谅  妈妈  但我们不像一家人很久了
No offence, Mom, but we haven't been a family in a long time.

307
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,000
嘿  别扭头就跑  亚历克斯!
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!

308
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,830
亚历克斯  只是…亚历克斯  过来
Alex, just... Alex, come here.

309
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,330
你能…
Can you...

310
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,840
不要那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

311
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,690
- 都是你的错! - 我的错?
- It's all your fault! - My fault?

312
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,480
你老是宠着他
You're the one that's always smothering him.

313
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,110
你连不帮他擦鼻子五分钟都做不到
You couldn't leave him alone for five minutes without wiping his nose.

314
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,980
你从来都不关心他的生活
Perhaps I was overcompensating for the fact

315
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,940
所以我才过度补偿他
that you never took an interest in his life.

316
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,700
他的生活是我的头等大事
His life was my top priority.

317
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,370
多少次我给他收拾烂摊子?
How many times did I save that kid from breaking his neck?

318
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,710
一点温暖和鼓励就够了
A little warmth and encouragement would have been nice.

319
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,900
我是他的父亲  这是不能改变的
I'm his father. It's implied.

320
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,500
我们一生都在寻找奇珍异宝
We've spent our entire lives searching for priceless artefacts,

321
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,180
而对我们最珍贵的东西
and the one thing that's most precious to us,

322
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,700
我们却失去了
we've lost.

323
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,410
我们不能让亚历克斯变成某个陌生人
We can't let Alex become some stranger

324
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,420
而照片却挂在我们的壁炉架上
in pictures on our mantle.

325
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,510
- 我们不能让那发生 - 不  我们不能
- We can't let that happen. - No, we can't.

326
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,140
我们该如何弥补?
How are we gonna fix this?

327
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,930
我们必须齐心协力
We need to do it together.

328
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,810
中国西部  准军事哨所
PARAMILITARY OUTPOST WESTERN CHINA

329
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,180
奥康纳一家人已经到上海了
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

330
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,850
他们拿到神眼了吗?
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

331
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,730
是的  我们的线人已经证实这件事了
Our spy says they do.

332
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,990
好
Good.

333
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,240
召集军队!
Assemble the troops!

334
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,760
是
Yes sir.

335
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,300
弟兄们!
Soldiers!

336
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,320
我们所做的训练和牺牲…
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

337
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,530
很快就可以得到丰盛的成果
will bear great fruit.

338
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,830
重振皇威是我多年的夙愿
It is my dream to raise our Emperor from his tomb.

339
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,670
平定天下非吾皇莫属
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

340
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,740
今晚…
Soldiers...

341
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,660
我们的圣战蓄势待发!
tonight our great battle begins!

342
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,940
知道吗  坐黄包车都比这快
You know, this might have been faster if we took a rickshaw.

343
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,370
这是中国的春节
It's Chinese New Year.

344
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,490
你不正是喜欢这个国家吗?
Don't you just love this country?

345
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,950
这有着那么多特别的节日  还一定要喝酒
They have so many extra little holidays, and drinking is mandatory.

346
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,620
难以相信我们要去看你的第一大发现
I can't believe we get to see your first big discovery.

347
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,750
太兴奋了
It's so exciting.

348
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,720
经昨晚后  我还以为你们根本不想看呢
Well, after last night, I'm surprised you want to see it at all.

349
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,420
听着  一个小时后我来接你们
JONATHAN: Listen, I'll pick you up in about an hour.

350
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,790
你不来?
EVELYN: You're not coming?

351
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,620
不  不  我这辈子看够木乃伊了
JONATHAN: No, no, I've seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.

352
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,380
就是他
There he is.

353
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,430
哦  亲爱的  多震惊啊
Oh, my darling, very impressive.

354
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,690
你打算什么时候打开石棺?
When do you get to open the sarcophagus?

355
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,820
等官方的正式文书下来吧
ALEX: Well, after the official red tape has been cut.

356
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,200
你们俩不知道"安息"这两字吗?
Do the words "rest in peace" mean anything to you two?

357
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,990
妈妈  你何不在这多留几天呢?
So, Mom, why don't you stick around for the next few days,

358
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,330
我们可以一起打开它
and we can open it together?

359
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,830
太好了  谢谢
I would like that very much, thanks.

360
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,200
亚历克斯  为什么不去告诉威尔逊教授
Alex, why don't you go and tell Professor Wilson

361
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,380
我们在这  你知道…
that we're here. You know...

362
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,830
没问题  太棒了
No problem. Great.

363
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,500
我离开的时候可不要把上面那家伙叫醒
Just don't wake the big guy up while I'm gone.

364
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,710
嗨  亚历克斯
Hey, Alex.

365
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:41,010
你知道  这一切真的是一个大发现
You know, this is all really, really big stuff.

366
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,430
随你怎么说  爸爸
Whatever you say, Dad.

367
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,760
怎么了?
What?

368
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,780
今晚你真是光彩夺目
You just have a certain glow about you this evening

369
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,810
我很久没见过了
I haven't seen in a long time.

370
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,230
我想这多亏了木乃伊
I guess mummies bring out the best in me.

371
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,980
在开罗失之交臂?抱歉打扰了
Take a wrong turn at Cairo? Sorry to interrupt.

372
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,160
- 罗杰 - 罗杰·威尔逊教授
- Roger. - Professor Roger Wilson.

373
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,580
里克
Rick.

374
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,210
知道吗  当亚历克斯告诉我你也参与时
You know, when Alex told me that you had gone legit,

375
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,330
别提我有多惊讶
I just couldn't believe my ears.

376
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,130
呃  我只是以保护的名义挖掘墓穴而已  伊芙琳
Well, now I just pillage tombs in the name of preservation. Evelyn.

377
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,340
- 恭喜你的最新发现 - 这都是亚历克斯的功劳
- Congratulations on your latest discovery. - Alex deserves all the credit.

378
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,510
真是个厉害的孩子  我把他当自己儿子一样
He's one hell of a kid. He's like the son I never had.

379
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,930
我们就只有他这么一个孩子
And he's the only one we've got,

380
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,050
所以下次你派他去实地考察时
so the next time you send him on one of your field trips,

381
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,440
请先知会我们一声
you give us the heads-up first.

382
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,890
好的  好的  当然
Yes, yes, of course.

383
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,400
我想你们拿了我们的东西
And now, I believe you have something that belongs to us.

384
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,070
是什么?
What's that?

385
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,180
哦  是说这个?
Oh, you mean this?

386
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,350
抱歉…
I'm sorry...

387
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,410
给  拿着
There, go ahead.

388
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,690
你的  罗杰
All yours, Rog.

389
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,230
我就知道能信任你们
I knew I could rely on you two.

390
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,540
恐怕你们的任务还没完成  奥康纳先生和夫人
I'm afraid your work is not done yet, Mr and Mrs O'Connell.

391
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,550
我来给你们介绍个朋友  杨将军
I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine. General Yang.

392
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,210
罗杰!
Roger!

393
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,040
就是他资助亚历克斯这次的挖掘 我们是一伙的
Well, he is the man who financed Alex's dig. We're in this together.

394
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,930
并肩战友  将军
Cheek by jowl. General.

395
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,420
搜他身
Search him.

396
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,060
不  神眼属于中国人民  你们不能这么做
No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people. You can't do this.

397
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,650
罗杰你个小人  你收了多少…
So, Rog, you snake, how much did...

398
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,530
是阴阳?……给你钱?
Is it Yin and Yang? ...pay you?

399
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,160
为了确保是你们俩送来神眼
Enough to pull strings at the Foreign Office,

400
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,670
我们在外交部可下了一番功夫  转过去
make sure that it was you two who delivered the Eye. Turn around.

401
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,150
神眼里含有永生泉的泉水
The Eye contains the elixir from the Pool of Eternal Life.

402
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,040
我要你打开它  奥康纳夫人
I need you to open it, Mrs O'Connell.

403
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
不
No.

404
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,180
你要用它来唤醒龙帝  对不对?
You're going to use it to wake the Emperor, aren't you?

405
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,440
还有他的兵马俑军队 这是我们的目的
And his Terracotta Army. At least, that's the general idea.

406
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,460
唤醒一支木乃伊军队真是疯了 听着  杨…
Raising an army of mummies is insane. Listen, Yang...

407
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,930
老实点!给我老实点
Easy! Go easy.

408
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,890
打开石棺  快!
Time to open the sarcophagus. Move!

409
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,770
念铭文!快!
Read the inscription! Now!

410
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,170
中国古文不是我的强项
Ancient Chinese isn't my forte.

411
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,200
看来需要点刺激  威尔逊!
Here's some encouragement. Wilson!

412
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,010
我念!
I'll do it!

413
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,200
不  伊芙  不要念! 他们最后还是会杀了我
No, Evy, don't do it! They're just gonna kill me, anyway.

414
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,570
铭文上说  只有拥有纯洁之心的人的一滴血
The inscription says that only a drop of blood

415
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,260
才能打开神眼
from a person of pure heart can open the Eye.

416
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,310
你的丈夫说得对
Your husband was right.

417
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,680
不!
No!

418
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,030
只有心灵纯洁才会为所爱之人牺牲自己
Only the pure of heart would sacrifice themselves for the one they love.

419
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,910
打开
Open it.

420
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,390
上次见面后你就没找过我
You never called after our last date.

421
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,800
没时间开玩笑  亚历克斯
I don't have time for games, Alex.

422
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,270
你知道我的名字  而我却不知道你的
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

423
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,560
我叫琳
It's Lin.

424
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,190
你是来向我解释要杀我的原因吗?
You want to explain to me why you tried to kill me?

425
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,400
我们可以这么做
We could do that.

426
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,680
或者我们可以去救你的父母
Or we could save your parents.

427
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,370
威尔逊  你个狗娘养的!
Wilson, you son of a bitch!

428
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,040
- 继续  奥康纳 - 好吧
- Get on with it, O'Connell. - All right.

429
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,560
一旦龙帝接触到这个  就会复活重新统治天下
Once this touches him, the Emperor will rise to rule again.

430
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,670
杀了他
Finish him off.

431
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,640
亚历克斯  求你了!不要  那是…
Alex, please! Don't. That's...

432
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,070
不要  不要  不要  求你了
Don't, don't. Don't, please.

433
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,200
不  不要  亚历克斯  是我  求你了
No, don't, Alex, it's me. Please.

434
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,450
不是他  这是个太监!这是圈套!
It's not him. This is a eunuch! It's a decoy!

435
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,480
龙帝到底在哪?
Where the hell's the Emperor?

436
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,060
呆着!
Stay!

437
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,570
又来了
Here we go again.

438
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,340
皇上  我是来保护你的
I live to serve you, my Lord.

439
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,020
我能帮你获得永生
I can help you become immortal.

440
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,340
如果你说谎  随时烧死你
If you are lying, you will burn.

441
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,200
等等!等等!等我下!我和你一起走!等等  等等…
Wait! Wait! You wait for me! I'm coming with you! Wait, wait...

442
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,470
小心!
Watch out!

443
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,230
我们得快去阻止那个木乃伊!
RICK: We got to put this mummy down fast!

444
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,290
时间越长  他们越强大!
The longer we wait, the stronger they get!

445
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,110
打开大门!打开大门!
Open the gate! Open the gate!

446
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
侬想死啊?

447
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,880
是  是  是  我知道  抱歉  朋友 有个木乃伊被放出来了
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Sorry, pal. There's a mummy on the loose.

448
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,260
- 你来开车? - 为什么不呢?
- You wanna drive? - Why not?

449
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,130
天哪  我爱上一个开卡车的女人
God, I love a woman who can drive a truck.

450
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,550
嘿  朋友  非常抱歉  但你知道吗? 新年快乐!
Hey, pal, I'm really sorry, but you know what? Happy New Year!

451
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,320
快开车  宝贝!
Hit it, honey!

452
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,380
不!让开!
No! Move over!

453
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,940
什么?不!
What? No!

454
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,760
不!
No!

455
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,180
不!
No!

456
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,270
- 什么? - 乔纳森  上车!
- What? - Jonathan, get in the back!

457
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,330
抱歉毁了你的车!
Sorry about the Rolls!

458
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,230
你们真像木乃伊磁铁!
You guys are like mummy magnets!

459
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,490
- 你得转过来! - 好的
- We have to turn you around! - Okay.

460
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,790
抱歉
Excuse me.

461
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,970
- 嘿  我们可以用这个! - 给我!
- Hey, we could use this! - Give me that!

462
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,320
- 哦  是啊  主意真不错 - 真大啊!
- Oh, yeah, that's a better idea. - RICK: Size counts!

463
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,720
别逗了!他们要跑远了!
Stop mucking about! They're getting away!

464
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,400
开好车!
Just drive!

465
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,860
- 瞄准龙帝! - 瞄准龙帝?
RICK: Aim for the Emperor! JONATHAN: Aim for the Emperor?

466
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,610
- 快点上  乔纳森! - 我在点啊!
- Light it up, Jonathan! - I'm trying!

467
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,220
开火!
Fire!

468
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,970
打中了吗?
Did we get him?

469
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,180
- 着火了! - 什么  还来?
- Fire! - What, again?

470
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
- 你屁股着火了! - 我的屁股?
- Your ass is on fire! - My ass?

471
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,140
- 不要动! - 里克  我屁股着火了!
- Hold still! - Rick, my ass is on fire!

472
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,680
- 快  拍我的… - 弄熄它!
- Well, spank my... - I'm putting it out!

473
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,520
- 帮我弄熄  里克! - 叫你不要动!
- Put me out, Rick! - Just hold still!

474
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,900
拍我的屁股!拍我的屁股!
Spank my ass! Spank my ass!

475
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,350
好吧  我来了!
All right, here I come!

476
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,100
把手给我!
LIN: Give me your hand!

477
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,350
快点!
Come on!

478
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,360
小心!
Watch out!

479
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,000
伊芙  你去哪?
RICK: Evy, where are you going?

480
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,620
- 抄近路! - 伊芙!
- Taking a short cut! - Evy!

481
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,720
- 跟你说了这是近路! - 是啊!
- I told you it was a short cut! - Right!

482
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,090
换他追我们了!
Now he's chasing us!

483
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,850
快!
Hurry!

484
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,270
把手给我  给  你会需要这些
Give me your hand. Here, you're gonna need these.

485
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,240
- 不用等我 - 你去哪?
- Don't wait up for me. - Where are you going?

486
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
出去!
Out!

487
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,660
- 里克呢? - 你觉得他会去哪?
- Where's Rick? - Where do you think?

488
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,250
该死!
Damn it!

489
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
你是我的!
You're mine!

490
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,270
- 把手给我  上马来! - 回去  爸爸!
- Give me your hand and get on this horse! - Get back, Dad!

491
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,720
亚历山大·鲁珀特·奥康纳 立即给我坐到马后面去
Alexander Rupert O'Connell, you get on the back of this horse this instant!

492
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,270
让开!让开!哦  天哪!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Oh, God!

493
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,690
伊芙!
JONATHAN: Evy!

494
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,960
我们得回去帮里克!
We've got to go back and help Rick!

495
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,330
里克!忘了里克!他们来了!
JONATHAN: Rick! Forget Rick! Here they come!

496
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,140
我去追龙帝
I'll go after the Emperor.

497
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,970
相信我  对付木乃伊  我更在行
Trust me. I've got a little more experience with mummies.

498
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,560
我拿着唯一可以杀死他的武器
And I have the only weapon that can kill him.

499
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,460
好吧  我掩护你  上!
Okay. I'll cover you. Let's go!

500
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,980
琳!
ALEX: Lin!

501
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,410
- 我以为你死了! - 他打偏了
- I thought you were dead! - He missed.

502
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,820
小心!
LIN: Look out!

503
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,850
谢谢  里克  你能去付钱吗?
Thanks, Rick. Could you get the cab?

504
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,610
我像带钱包的人吗?
Does it look like I have a wallet?

505
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,520
知道吗  我差点就杀了龙帝
You know, I would have killed the Emperor

506
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,980
要不是你们俩暴露了我的行踪
if you two hadn't blown my cover.

507
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,320
一切皆在我掌控之中
I had everything under control.

508
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,660
哦  是嘛  我们就是这么想的
Oh, yeah, that's exactly what we were thinking.

509
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,570
是啊  动作真快  你又复活了一个木乃伊
Yeah, well, good going, you raised another mummy.

510
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,610
而这混蛋还有超能力
And this bugger's got superpowers.

511
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,950
他能控制火  水  金  天晓得还有什么
ALEX: He's got control over fire, water, metal and who knows what else.

512
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,120
你却把他挖了出来
And you dug him up anyway.

513
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,950
是的  你不会想把这个也怪到我头上吧  爸爸?
Yeah, well, you're not gonna pin this one on me, okay, Dad?

514
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,290
- 是我吗? - 哦  住口  你们两个
- RICK: Am I? - Oh, stop it, you two.

515
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,790
不是谁的错  是威尔逊利用了我们
No one's to blame here. Wilson manipulated all of us.

516
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,000
确实如此
Yeah, that's true.

517
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,170
我为我父母向你道歉
I apologise for my parents.

518
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,500
不过我觉得我们合作地还不错
But I thought we worked really well together.

519
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,750
除了没杀成龙帝
Except we failed.

520
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,840
抱歉  我们还没互相介绍过
I'm sorry, we haven't been properly introduced.

521
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,520
- 你到底是谁? - 我叫琳
- Who are you exactly? - My name is Lin.

522
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,970
几个世纪以来我的家族一直看守着龙帝的墓穴
My family has watched over the Emperor's tomb for centuries.

523
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,400
只有用这个刺穿龙帝的心脏才能杀死他
The Emperor cannot be killed unless he is stabbed through the heart with this.

524
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,600
我母亲很久以前就在这上面下了咒语
My mother put a curse on it long ago.

525
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,010
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,610
过来  简短开下家庭会议  亚历克斯
Well, a quick family meeting, Alex.

527
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,900
- 坐 - 下
- Sit. - Down.

528
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,540
你对这女孩了解多少?
What do you really know about this girl?

529
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,280
不是很了解
Well, not much,

530
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,380
但经过今晚她的帮助 我愿意相信她
but after her help tonight, I'm willing to go on a little faith.

531
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,340
- 相信 - 没时间了
- Faith. - Time is running out.

532
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,920
你真的不懂什么叫私人空间吗?
You don't really believe in the concept of personal space, do you?

533
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,510
若龙帝到达香格里拉  喝下永生泉水
If the Emperor reaches Shangri-La and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,

534
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,470
他会唤醒他的军队  到时大家都完了
he will raise his army and no one will be safe.

535
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,100
就像我想永远年轻英俊一样
Much as I'd like to stay this boyishly handsome forever,

536
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,640
香格里拉只是个传说
Shangri-La is a crock.

537
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,680
是啊  以前你也是这么说木乃伊的  乔
Yeah, but that's what you used to say about mummies, too, Jon.

538
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,900
- 真会开脱啊 - 你说对了
- You did pretty well off it. - Good point.

539
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,410
香格里拉的入口位于喜马拉雅山的高处山口
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

540
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,650
远处是一座金塔
Beyond it is a golden tower.

541
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,450
一旦钻石放到顶部  就会指出通向香格里拉的道路
Once the diamond is placed at the top, it will point the way to Shangri-La.

542
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,580
杨将军还拿着钻石
Yang still has the diamond,

543
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,080
他和龙帝一定会去那
and that's where he and the Emperor will go.

544
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,250
她说得对
She's right.

545
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,420
关于神眼的所有传说都提到了入口
All the legends of the Eye mention the Gateway.

546
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,670
这姑娘不错  亚历克斯  她知道所有事情
I like her, Alex. She knows what's what.

547
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:48,260
我们相信你了  你能带我们去那吗?
Now, just say that we were to believe you, could you guide us there?

548
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,170
好的  我去过一次  我记得路
Yes. I have been there once. I remember the way.

549
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,060
喜马拉雅山  我们需要一架飞机
Himalayas. We're going to need a plane.

550
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,350
我只知道疯狗能做到
Well, I know just the Mad Dog for the job.

551
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,230
任何有自尊的飞行员都会在谷底降落
MAGUIRE: Well, any self-respecting pilot would land on the valley floor,

552
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,070
不过我可没什么自尊可言
but I don't have any self-respect,

553
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,400
所以我会在半山腰把你们放下
so I'll put you down halfway up the mountain.

554
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,240
那会对我们有利
That should give us a good advantage.

555
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,410
当然  但我不能保证我们所有人都能活着
MAGUIRE: Of course, I can't guarantee any of us will live.

556
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,100
好的!
Great!

557
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,730
我该告诉你们系好安全带的 可我太穷了买不起
I'd tell you to fasten your seatbelts, but I was too cheap to buy any!

558
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,910
- 我干嘛笑? - 到了!
- Why am I laughing? - Here we go!

559
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,010
疯狗  疯狗! 慢点  慢点  慢点!
RICK: Mad Dog, Mad Dog! Ease up, ease up, ease up!

560
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,960
哦  天哪!
JONATHAN: Oh, God!

561
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,470
马奎尔!
JONATHAN: Maguire!

562
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,690
快啊  朋友!
Come on, man!

563
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,440
疯狗!
Mad Dog!

564
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,170
停下!不  不!大家不要动
RICK: Brake! No, no! Nobody move.

565
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,400
不要动  大家都不要动!
Nobody move, nobody move!

566
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,090
那是什么恶心味道?
What is that God-awful smell?

567
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,090
牦牛吐的
The yak yakked.

568
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,850
恭迎皇上来到20世纪
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

569
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,240
唤朕何为?
Why did you raise me?

570
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,940
我们需要陛下带领我们重振声威
I love this land. Only you can lead us back to greatness.

571
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,190
尔等何求?
What is in it for you?

572
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,570
当阵将军  侍奉主人
I want to serve as your general.

573
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,540
上一个将军…
The last general I trusted...

574
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,830
背叛朕
betrayed me.

575
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,170
臣不会犯此错误
I will not make that mistake.

576
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:07,130
这泥之身无力唤醒大军…
I cannot escape this curse until I am immortal...

577
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,430
将军
General.

578
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,940
臣明白
I understand, my Lord.

579
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,300
故臣已获陛下长生秘诀
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

580
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,060
此物能明示长生之道
This will point the way.

581
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,850
Can't you see it's Mr McGuire 没看到是麦奎尔先生嘛
Can't you see it's Mr McGuire

582
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,770
come to court your sister Kate 来向你妹妹凯特求爱
come to court your sister Kate

583
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:51,350
你知道他有一家农场  一个小小的…
You know very well he owns the farm a wee bit out...

584
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,860
德耳塔-探戈-阿尔法  呼叫跳飞 回答  跳飞
MAGUIRE O VER RADIO... Delta-Tango-Alpha to Ricochet. Come in, Ricochet.

585
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,960
德耳塔-探戈-阿尔法  我是跳飞  说吧  疯狗
Delta-Tango-Alpha, this is Ricochet. Go ahead, Mad Dog.

586
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,500
嗯  记得你要我留意的那个叫杨的家伙吗?
Yeah, you know that Yang fellow you told me to keep me eye out for?

587
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,790
他刚刚出现了
He's just shown up.

588
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,130
跳飞明白  谢了  疯狗
Ricochet out. Thanks, Mad Dog.

589
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,880
该我们了  大伙!出发!
That's us, people! Let's go!

590
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,210
- 乔纳森  醒醒! - 什么…
- Jonathan, wake up! - What...

591
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,540
坚持下去!
Hold the line!

592
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,810
很好  我们已经走了过半的路程
Good, we're a little more than halfway.

593
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,850
我们在…今晚我们在那过夜
We're gonna... We're gonna camp up there for the night.

594
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,870
琳说  如果我们在黎明出发 我们就能在中午前到达入口
ALEX: Lin says if we leave at first light, we'll reach the Gateway by noon.

595
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,960
她有没有说她是如何知道这么多入口的事的?
Did she happen to mention how she knows so much about the Gateway?

596
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,250
没  没有  她有点神秘兮兮的
No, not really. Kind of mysterious.

597
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,790
显然她把你迷倒了
She's certainly managed to enchant you.

598
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,640
得了  亚历克斯  你喜欢上她了
Come on, Alex. You obviously like her.

599
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,180
妈妈  山上空气稀薄  你也头脑发昏了
Mom, the thin mountain air, clearly messing with your head.

600
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,270
无论她藏着什么秘密
Whatever secret she's hiding,

601
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,230
我只是不想看到你受伤
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

602
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,780
我很感激  但是  你知道
I appreciate that, but, you know,

603
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,910
我对异性也有很多经验了
I've had my fair share of experience with the opposite sex.

604
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,570
真的?
Really?

605
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,120
那有多少次经验了呢?
How many experiences are we talking about?

606
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,510
不想知道答案就不该问
Well, you shouldn't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to

607
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,220
知道吗  妈妈?
okay, Mom?

608
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,820
好吧
Right.

609
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,830
嘿  妈妈
Hey, Mom.

610
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,460
很抱歉因木乃伊被唤醒的事而责怪你们
I'm sorry I blamed you guys for raising the Emperor.

611
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,310
有什么好笑的?
What's so funny?

612
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,500
我妈觉得我们之间有什么
My mother is under the impression there's something between us.

613
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,990
我希望不是什么浪漫的事
I hope nothing romantic.

614
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:26,170
是啊  我跟她说没什么机会
Yeah, well, I told her there was no chance of that.

615
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,620
我们完全是不一样的人  你和我  明白吗?
We're complete opposites, you and me, right?

616
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:34,160
你守护墓穴  而我是盗墓的 你喜欢古代刀剑  我喜欢枪支
You guard tombs. I raid them. You like ancient knives. I'm into guns.

617
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,930
这些都是不易改变的差异
Those are some pretty insurmountable odds.

618
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,670
- 完全如此 - 很好
- Absolutely. - Well, good.

619
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,350
既然我们开诚布公了 我们就能专心消灭龙帝了
Now that we've cleared that up, we can focus on taking down the Emperor.

620
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,470
完全同意
I agree totally.

621
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,810
还有  你不是我喜欢的类型
Besides, you're not my type.

622
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,890
当然了  你不会喜欢一个能将你背摔的女人
Of course not. You don't like a woman who can knock you on your backside.

623
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,600
应该说"踢我的屁股"
The expression is "kick my ass."

624
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,110
到目前为止你还没做过
And for the record, you didn't.

625
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,670
哎  我真是不容易啊  知道吗
Yeah, it's not easy being me, you know.

626
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,470
同样地  我想你也不容易吧
Then again, I don't suppose it's easy being you,

627
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,710
不是吗  杰拉尔丁  老姑娘?
is it, Geraldine, old girl?

628
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,010
如果我遇上像你这样的女孩  杰拉尔丁…
If I'd met a girl like you, Geraldine...

629
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,420
勤快  话不多
You know, hard-working, you don't say much,

630
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,880
毛比较多  但我不介意
you're a little bit hairy, but I don't mind that.

631
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,230
在那!我们找到了!
There it is! We found it!

632
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,240
香格里拉的入口!
The Gateway of Shangri-La!

633
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,300
走  姑娘!走!你自由了
JONATHAN: Go, girl! Go! You're free!

634
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,000
走吧  杰拉尔丁  自由自在地活着
Go, Geraldine! Live free!

635
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,890
你在干什么?抢劫武器?
What did you do now? Rob an armoury?

636
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,030
你见过瓦尔特P38吗?
Have you ever seen a Walther P38?

637
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,360
比调停者逊多了
Looks pretty anaemic compared to the Peacekeeper.

638
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,230
不是大小的问题  爸爸  而是火力的问题
Well, it's not about size, Dad. It's about stamina.

639
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,280
你要火力?
You want power?

640
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:37,380
给你汤普森冲锋枪  50发一弹鼓
I give you the Thompson submachine gun. Fifty rounds a drum.

641
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,630
- 25弹匣 - 是不错  爸爸
- Twenty-five a mag. - Tommy's good, Dad,

642
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,420
但击发装置老卡壳
but the cocking mechanism always jams.

643
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,890
来  看看俄罗斯产的PPS个人攻击武器
Here. Check out the Russian PPS Personal Assault Weapon.

644
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,680
这才是需要的
Now, this is the future right here.

645
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,140
靠经验才能成功  光靠火力是没用的
You know, it's experience that wins the day. It's not all about firepower.

646
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,180
小伙子们!我可以…
Boys! If I may...

647
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,150
我们有什么计划对付龙帝吗?
Do we have a plan for the Emperor?

648
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,190
有啊  我们会又快又狠地将他打飞
Yeah. We're gonna hit him high, hard and fast

649
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,020
然后再把他当成明代花瓶一样打碎
and smash him like a Ming vase.

650
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,240
- 如果那没用呢? - 我们还有B计划
- And if that doesn't work? - We go to plan B.

651
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,490
B计划!你爬上去  然后炸了那座金塔
Plan B! You go upstairs, you blow up that gold tower thing.

652
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,700
- 你点火  我们把他炸上天! - 我?
- You light it up. We blow the guy sky high! - Me?

653
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,830
- 你!什么? - 爸爸?
- You! What? - Dad?

654
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,030
如果我们没炸死  也会被雪崩压死
So if the explosion doesn't kill us, the avalanche will.

655
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,630
- 你有更好的主意? - 是的  有啊
- You got a better idea? - Yeah. I do.

656
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,580
我的想法是  用远程消音来复枪伏击他
I say we ambush him with long-range rifles and silencers.

657
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,750
远程  很不错的主意
Long-range, that's a better idea.

658
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,910
是啊  我们可以慢慢靠近  爸爸
Yeah, we can get in close, Dad.

659
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,120
- 听起来不错 - 然后了结他
- JONATHAN: Much better idea. - And then we can finish him off

660
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,840
- 用琳的匕首 - 抱歉
- with Lin's dagger. - Look, I'm sorry,

661
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,590
我不太相信你女朋友的神奇匕首
I just don't put much faith in your girlfriend's magic dagger.

662
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,890
- 好吧  爸爸  她不是我女朋友 - 你现在这么说了
- Okay, Dad, she is not my girlfriend. - You say that now,

663
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,050
- 但我还是不相信她 - 我信
- but I still don't trust her. - Well, I do.

664
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,840
- 你该相信我的判断  知道吗? - 听着  孩子
- So you should trust my judgement, okay? - Look, kid,

665
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,600
我干掉的木乃伊比你多
I've put down more mummies in my time than you.

666
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,100
你只干掉过一个  爸爸
You put down one mummy, Dad.

667
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,810
是啊  同一个木乃伊两次!
Yeah. Same mummy twice!

668
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,060
把绿线递给我  好吗?
EVELYN: Hand me the green wire, will you, please?

669
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,610
你有把握吗?
Are you sure you know what you are doing?

670
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,860
当然  我做过一百次了
Of course. I've done this a hundred times.

671
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,940
如果龙帝把神眼放在那上面 那什么都完了
If the Emperor places the Eye up there, all will be lost.

672
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,540
扫清障碍
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

673
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:13,080
让朕见识一下  你是何等的良将
Prove yourself to me.

674
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,420
火箭炮

675
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,060
给他们来个热烈的奥康纳式欢迎!
Let's give a warm O'Connell welcome!

676
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,430
开火!

677
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,520
开火!
Fire!

678
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,900
- 火箭炮! - 开火!
Bazooka!

679
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,460
退后!
RICK: Fall back!

680
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,220
亚历克斯!跟我来!
Alex! Follow me!

681
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,650
快点!

682
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,320
我们得干掉那些火箭炮!
We gotta take out those bazookas!

683
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,570
走!
Go!

684
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,000
- 全跟我来 - 退后!
Fall back!

685
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,630
快!快!快!快!
Move! Move! Move! Move!

686
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:49,190
实行B计划!炸了塔!
Time to go to plan B! Blow up the tower!

687
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,140
嘿  我对B计划不怎么放心!
Hey, I'm actually a little bit concerned about plan B!

688
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,650
我们直接进行C计划吧?
Couldn't we go straight to plan C?

689
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,770
快去引爆它!我掩护你!
Just make it go bang! I'll cover you!

690
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,220
快
Come on.

691
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,910
好吧  我们走  走  走!快  快!
All right, let's go, go, go! Come on, come on!

692
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:03,230
快  哦  小心点
Come on. Oh, be good.

693
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,590
你们右边!
Set up a crossfire!

694
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,500
快! 右边小心
Move it!

695
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,830
最后一弹匣!
EVELYN: My last round!

696
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:48,510
耶缇  索特  快来啊! 耶缇  索特  快来啊!

697
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:03,680
- 喜马拉雅雪人? - 西藏人管他们叫耶缇!
- Abominable snowmen? - The Tibetans call them yeti!

698
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,990
求你们了!我需要你们的帮助!
Please! I need your help!

699
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,530
那些士兵是魔鬼!
These soldiers are evil!

700
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,450
她会说耶缇语?
She speaks Yeti?

701
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,710
开火!把他们干掉!
Shoot! Kill them!

702
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,350
为什么老是我来做这种扭转乾坤的事!
Why do I always have to save the day?

703
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,310
我讨厌得听从小孩的!
I hate it when the kid's right!

704
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,230
对付另一个家伙!
Get the other guy!

705
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,400
谢谢!
Thanks!

706
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,040
敌人!
Trouble!

707
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,170
想慢慢地死还是痛快地死
You can die slow or you can die fast.

708
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,470
丑八怪!

709
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,620
快!快!快!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

710
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,450
耶!我搞定了!
Yeah! I did it!

711
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,460
哦  妈呀  我搞定了!该撤退了
Oh, Mother, I did it! Time for a retreat, I think.

712
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,180
我们是一伙的!我是成员之一!
I'm on your team! I'm a team player!

713
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:46,680
"我为人人  人人为我"类似的!
"One for all and all for me" kind of thing!

714
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,180
炸药  那些炸药!我们得离开这!
The dynamite, all this dynamite! We should get out of here!

715
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,340
退后!退后!
Back off! Back off!

716
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,410
跑!
LIN: Run!

717
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:41,810
我恨木乃伊!他们从不公平对决!
I hate mummies! They never play fair!

718
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:52,240
爸爸!爸爸  你要干什么?
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

719
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:03,500
这里!这里!来啊!这里!
Over here! Over here! Come on! Over here!

720
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,670
哦  不!
Oh, no!

721
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,380
里克!
Rick!

722
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,790
香格里拉
Shangri-La.

723
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,220
那是钻石
That's a diamond.

724
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,270
我喜欢那么大颗钻石!
I could use a diamond like that.

725
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,280
爸爸!
Dad!

726
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,350
哦  坚持  坚持住  爸爸
Okay, hold it. Hold on there, Dad.

727
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,560
不会有事的  求你了  求求你 求求你  坚持住  好不好  爸爸?
All right, please, please, please put pressure on it, okay, Dad?

728
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,380
没事的  没事的  再糟糕的都经历过了
RICK: It's all right, it's all right. We've been in tougher scrapes than this.

729
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,550
雪崩!
Avalanche!

730
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,300
- 帮我!帮帮我! - 琳!
- Help! Help me! - Lin!

731
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,890
求求你们!帮帮我!
Please! Help me!

732
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:09,970
耶!
Yes!

733
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,850
我拿到了!我还活着!
I've got it! And I'm still alive!

734
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,270
帮我  求求你们  谁来帮帮我!
ALEX:  Help me, please. Somebody help me!

735
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:23,460
- 我们在这里!在这里! - 亚历克斯?
- We're over here! Over here! - Alex?

736
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,370
- 妈妈  妈妈  我们在下面 - 亚历克斯
- ALEX: Mom, Mom, we're down here! - Alex?

737
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:28,320
我们在这里!
We're over here!

738
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,000
哦  天哪
Oh, God.

739
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:47,290
我们得马上带他到香格里拉! 这是我们的最后机会
We've got to take him to Shangri-La now! It's our only chance.

740
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,240
到了!
We made it!

741
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,550
那池子
The Pool.

742
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,810
母亲
Mother.

743
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,350
小宝贝
My sweet daughter.

744
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,320
求求你…求求你
I beg you...

745
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,920
我父亲
My father is dying.

746
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,690
需要帮忙
They are my friends.

747
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,960
哦  求求你
Oh, please.

748
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,490
走
go

749
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,790
谢谢
Thank you.

750
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:42,240
他需要休息  带他去我的房间
He must rest. We'll take him to my chamber.

751
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:03,770
你去哪  将军?命运等着我们
Where are you going, General? Our destiny awaits.

752
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,660
不是所有人的妹夫都能死里逃生的
Well, it's not everyone that gets their brother-in-law back from the dead.

753
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,610
我一生80年中给我那么十天就好了
Yeah, give me my four score years and ten any day.

754
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,490
这是香格里拉?
Is this Shangri-La?

755
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:37,290
我可以住这  机会多多
I could live here. Lots of opportunity.

756
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,760
一个娱乐场
A casino.

757
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:49,010
让你参与我的复仇计划是一个错误
I was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

758
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,070
不  母亲
No, mother.

759
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,310
您让我干什么都行
I would do anything for you.

760
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,990
他在休息了  谢谢
ALEX: He's resting well. Thank you.

761
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,760
你们是怎么卷进来的?
How'd you get involved in all this?

762
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,300
皇帝杀了我唯一爱过的男人  琳的父亲
The Emperor murdered the only man I ever loved, Lin's father.

763
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,220
要不是耶缇发现了我  把我带到这池子
I would have died, too, by his hand,

764
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,230
我应该也被他杀了
if the yeti had not found me and brought me to this pool.

765
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,390
等等  这是如何发生的?
Hang on a second. How did this all happen?

766
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,850
这都是公元前的事了
This was before Christ.

767
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,200
你守卫这个墓穴多久了?
How long were you guarding his tomb?

768
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,350
超过两千年
Over 2,000 years.

769
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,410
不能让皇帝靠近这个池子
The Emperor must never be allowed to reach the Pool,

770
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,420
否则他就有力量召集他的军队了
or he will have the power to raise his army.

771
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,130
一旦他变成不死之身
And once he becomes immortal,

772
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:53,260
他将成为前所未有的邪恶生物
he can transform himself into the most hideous creatures ever seen.

773
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:56,700
我先去守护入口
I will take the first watch at the entrance.

774
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,970
知道嘛  我不介意和老女人约会
You know, I have no problem dating an older woman.

775
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,180
恐怕我们不能在一起
I'm afraid we can't be together.

776
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:15,680
等等  什么?为什么?
Wait. What? Why?

777
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,940
因为我是不死之身
Because I'm going to live forever.

778
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,030
我不要看着你死
I don't want to watch you die.

779
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,820
那又怎样?就因为这个?
So what? That's it?

780
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,420
你想就这样算了  就这样永生吗?
You're just gonna sit on the sidelines for eternity?

781
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,990
母亲为父亲伤心了好几个世纪
My mother has mourned my father for centuries.

782
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,290
我不知道自己是否能承受
I don't know if my heart can bear it.

783
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:44,130
人无法在哀伤中过一生
People can live an entire lifetime in one look.

784
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,830
我的父母就是这样过来的
I watch my parents do it every day.

785
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,890
亚历克斯?
JONATHAN: Alex?

786
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,040
你父亲醒了  上来!
Your father's awake. Get up here!

787
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,160
嗨
Hello.

788
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:17,210
如果这是天堂  那还真是不错
If this is heaven, it looks pretty good so far.

789
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:27,990
真高兴看到某些永恒的东西
Nice to see some things never change.

790
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:48,600
对他宽容点  他吓坏了
Go easy on him. He feels terrible.

791
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,620
我看到你躺在那里时  爸爸…
When I saw you lying there, Dad...

792
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,000
我从没这么害怕过
I've never been so scared in my life.

793
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,830
我也是
Well, that makes two of us.

794
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,430
我的意思是  你不会死的  明白吗?
I mean, you know, you're not supposed to die, you know?

795
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,550
你可是跳飞·奥康纳  不是吗?
You're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

796
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:12,890
你被打被摔
You get beat up, you get tossed around,

797
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,600
但最后你仍是站在那
but, well, you're always standing there in the end.

798
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,310
我从没想过没有你的世界
I never really thought of the world without you.

799
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,440
亚历克斯
Alex,

800
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,140
实际上
the truth is,

801
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,360
我只是想…
I'm just trying to...

802
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,000
我只是…
I'm just...

803
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,290
我想当一个好丈夫
I'm trying to be a good husband.

804
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,750
我想当一个好父亲
I'm trying to be a good parent.

805
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:42,420
而事实是  最近我做错了  而且…
And the truth is, I've been dropping the ball lately, and...

806
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,460
不是的  你知道  我不是一个好儿子  不是吗?
No, you know, I haven't been the world's greatest son, you know?

807
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,600
不  不  那都是遗传自你妈妈
No, no, that's 'cause you get it from her side of the family.

808
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,460
来
Come here.

809
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,470
我的儿子
My boys.

810
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:03,890
你看来好累了  你得休息
You look tired, you should rest.

811
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,060
我留下来
I'll stay.

812
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:09,240
命运快到最后的决战时刻了
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

813
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,830
要是我们想击败皇帝…
If we are to defeat the Emperor...

814
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:15,870
我得要求你再做出一次牺牲
I must ask for one more sacrifice.

815
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,610
什么都行  母亲
Anything, mother.

816
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,610
献出你的永生
Your immortality.

817
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,800
哦  不!他的力量完全恢复了
Oh, no! His powers have been fully restored!

818
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,630
行动吧
Time to go.

819
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,610
郭明的女儿
General Ming's daughter.

820
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,790
她是我的了
Your child will be mine.

821
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,580
他是不死之身
He is immortal.

822
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:49,540
嘿!你这三头怪物  狗娘养的!
Hey! You three-headed shape-shifting son of a bitch!

823
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,290
琳!
Lin!

824
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,520
亚历克斯!
LIN: Alex!

825
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,220
亚历克斯!
Alex!

826
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,210
他带她回墓穴召集军队去了!
He's taking her back to his tomb to raise his army!

827
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,420
- 有没有更快的方法赶到那? - 耶缇  他们能帮上忙
- Is there a faster way down from here? - The yeti. They'll help.

828
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,590
可他已经飞上天了  太晚了!
But he's already in the air. It'll be too late!

829
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:39,250
疯狗飞得可比这三头蜥蜴快多了!我们走
Mad Dog can outfly a three-headed lizard any day of the week! Let's go.

830
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,550
左边!9点钟方向!
MAGUIRE: Portside! Nine o'clock!

831
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,450
里克?我是不是该戒酒了?
Rick? Should I quit drinking?

832
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,950
乔纳森呼叫里克
O VER RADIO... Jonathan to Rick.

833
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,030
如果你们想把他打回墓穴  你们最好快点!
You'd better get a move on if you're gonna beat him to the tomb!

834
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,380
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah,

835
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:07,820
你尽快带增援回来
just get back here as fast as you can with the reinforcements.

836
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,070
不要看风景了!
No sightseeing!

837
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,950
给你  爸爸
Here, Dad.

838
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,090
- 给我? - 是啊
- Is that for me? - Yeah.

839
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,740
不错
Nice.

840
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,140
只要兵马俑军队没越过长城  我们还可以击败他们
The Terracotta Army is not indestructible until it crosses the Great Wall.

841
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:24,590
太好了  到底我们该如何阻止他们呢?
That's comforting. How exactly are we supposed to fend them off?

842
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,920
皇帝建造长城时
When the Emperor built the Wall,

843
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,390
把他的敌人都埋在城墙下
he buried his enemies underneath it

844
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,890
并诅咒他们的灵魂永世不得超生
and cursed their souls to hold it up for eternity.

845
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:34,900
大部分是被打败的士兵  我会召唤他们再次战斗
Most of them were conquered soldiers. I will call them to battle once again.

846
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:40,890
打开祭坛  召唤军队  这计划不错  走吧
Unlock an altar, raise an army. That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

847
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,000
抓住了
Grab her.

848
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,420
- 看紧她 - 跟我来
Guard her with your life.

849
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,710
亚历克斯?
Alex?

850
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,580
- 他人呢? - 你觉得呢?
- Where'd he go? - Where do you think?

851
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,990
醒来!
AWAKE!

852
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:18,340
尔等醒于今…
Today you awake to a world...

853
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,050
止世上混乱腐败
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

854
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,230
打开通往过去的入口
Open the gates of the past

855
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:26,260
释放受害者的灵魂
and free the souls of the wrongfully damned.

856
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,840
必恢复法制…
I will restore order...

857
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,850
朕  必须夺回天下
I will retake what is mine.

858
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,810
绝自由于患
I will crush any idea of freedom.

859
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:38,030
以祖先和正义之名
In the name of the ancestors and the righteous,

860
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:41,500
献上我与女儿的永生
I sacrifice my immortality and that of my daughter

861
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,490
来让你们复活!
so that you may rise this day!

862
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,700
朕召尔等
I will slaughter without mercy.

863
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,540
威望广施正义于天下
I will conquer without compassion.

864
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,250
尔等随朕
I will now lead you past the Great Wall.

865
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:55,330
跨越长城  长生不老
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

866
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:01,450
熄灭被压迫者对暴君及其追随者的怒火!
Bring down the wrath of the oppressed on this Emperor and all who follow him!

867
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:03,890
攻占城池!
I raised you for one purpose...

868
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,130
大开杀戒  毫不留情!
to enforce my will on the entire world!

869
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,260
皇上万岁!
Long live the Emperor!

870
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,810
我召唤你们  成千上万的冤魂
I call upon the hundreds and the thousands

871
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:19,780
把握此刻  赢得胜利
that you may rise up and seize this moment to take your victory,

872
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,060
以正义之名  报仇雪恨
to take your justice and to take your revenge!

873
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,630
紫苑
Zi Yuan.

874
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,560
明将军!
It's General Ming!

875
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,680
跟随明将军!
Follow General Ming!

876
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,100
备战!备战!
Prepare for battle!

877
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:14,280
这些是…他们是不死的好人  对吧?
These are... They're good undead guys, right?

878
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:17,500
哦  不  不  不!
Oh, no, no, no!

879
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,880
紫苑!紫苑!紫苑派我们来的!
Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan sent us!

880
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,210

- Darling, I don't think he speaks English. - RICK: We're with Zi Yuan!

881
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:25,990
紫苑?
Zi Yuan?

882
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,790
是的
Right.

883
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,740
冲啊
Let's go.

884
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,090
战斗!
To battle!

885
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,780
自由!自由!自由!
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

886
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,200
换箭阵!
Archers form up!

887
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,700
来了!
Incoming!

888
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,090
- 嘿!那是我最喜欢的蓝衬衫 - 我一直不喜欢那件衬衫
- Hey! That's my favourite blue shirt. - I've always hated that shirt.

889
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,770
啊  对不起啊  对不起对不起 你头在这  你头在这

890
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,990
灭郭明!
Death to General Ming!

891
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,370
冲啊!
Charge!

892
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,710
欢迎来到20世纪!
Welcome to the 20th century!

893
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:20,020
向右翼进攻
We can't let them cross the wall!

894
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,150
你已非不死之身
You are no longer immortal.

895
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:31,900
亲爱的!退回高地!
Honey! Fall back to higher ground!

896
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,510
我真的很讨厌木乃伊!
I really hate mummies!

897
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:43,330
我也是!
It seems the feeling's mutual!

898
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,210
闭嘴  粘土小子  砍你的头!
Shut up, clay boy! Fore!

899
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,000
快跑!
Run!

900
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,520
- 接住! - 拿到了!
- Catch! - Got it!

901
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:11,940
下次我说"比这个更糟的都经历过" 就是指这次!
Next time I say, "We've been in tougher scrapes than this," I mean this!

902
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,520
去死  你们这群木乃伊混蛋!都去死!
Die, you mummy bastards! Die!

903
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,060
没必要说脏话
There is no call for bad language!

904
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:49,560
乔纳森真能把握入场时机
Jonathan certainly knows how to make an entrance!

905
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,970
有遗憾吗  亲爱的?
Any regrets, darling?

906
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,050
没  永远不会
None. Not ever.

907
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:33,990
- 你们没事吧? - 当然  没问题
- You okay? - Yeah, sure, no problem.

908
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,970
完全在我们的控制之中
We had it completely under control.

909
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:42,530
这家伙怎么那么多花招?
This guy ever run out of tricks?

910
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,240
不!
No!

911
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:56,960
母亲!不!
Mother! No!

912
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,080
母亲!
Mother!

913
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,310
母亲!母亲!
Mother! Mother!

914
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:20,610
刺穿他的心脏
Pierce through his heart.

915
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:27,950
你得活着  战斗下去
You must live and fight on.

916
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:49,520
她说刺穿心脏
She said through the heart.

917
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,550
刺穿心脏  我们走
Through the heart. Let's go.

918
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:07,530
快上车!
Get in!

919
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,110
奥康纳他们要去刺杀皇上了
The O'Connells are going to stop the Emperor!

920
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,760
爸爸  有计划了吗?
So, Dad, what's the plan?

921
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,350
声东击西!
Divide and conquer!

922
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:29,920
不用攻击  是不是太简单了?
No offence, but isn't that a little short on detail?

923
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,130
- 十二点方向下面! - 抓紧!
- Twelve o'clock low! - Hang on!

924
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,400
记得我们说好的!
Remember our deal!

925
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,120
一切结束后  请我们喝酒!
When this is over, my men get to drink for free!

926
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,120
整个酒吧拿去都没问题!
You can have the whole damn bar for all I care!

927
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,320
我可不想呆在中国!
I'm getting the hell out of China.

928
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:25,600
当初是我挖你出来的…
I dug you up...

929
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,980
现在我要赶你回去
and I'm gonna put you down.
