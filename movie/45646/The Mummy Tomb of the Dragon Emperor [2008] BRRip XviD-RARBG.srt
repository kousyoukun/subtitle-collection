1
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,669
Leave me.

2
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,880
Prepare for war!

3
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,846
Stop! I am not harmed.

4
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,813
We attack tonight!

5
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,287
I have too much to do for one lifetime.

6
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,630
Your Majesty...

7
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,387
Rise up.

8
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,227
I do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...

9
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,272
...but I know where to find it.

10
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:15,774
General...

11
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,112
No man is to touch her.

12
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,033
She is mine.

13
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,034
This is a key.

14
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,027
You have served me well.

15
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,866
I will grant you anything you desire.

16
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,996
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

17
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,834
Of course.

18
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,460
Read.

19
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,617
I feel your spell working.

20
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:37,875
I am now immortal.

21
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,129
Come, I want to show you something.

22
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,440
Become my queen and I will let him live.

23
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,652
Do what he says! Save yourself!

24
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,950
You will never keep your word.

25
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,620
You are right.

26
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,636
Now, join General Ming in hell.

27
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,654
What did you do to me?

28
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,782
I cursed you and your army.

29
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,923
Surround the Palace!

30
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,466
The Emperor is in trouble!

31
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,105
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND

32
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,516
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

33
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,603
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

34
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,063
Our spy says they do-

35
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,648
Good.

36
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,983
Assemble the troops!

37
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,151
Yes sir.

38
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,656
Soldiers!

39
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,660
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

40
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,872
will bear great fruit.

41
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,168
It is my dream to raise our Emperor
from his tomb.

42
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:03,005
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

43
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,090
Soldiers...

44
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:10,012
tonight our great battle begins!

45
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,117
I live to serve you, my Lord.

46
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,785
I can help you become immortal.

47
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,705
If you are lying, you will burn.

48
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,213
Hurry!

49
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,233
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

50
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,694
Why did you raise me?

51
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:39,323
I love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.

52
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,577
What is in it for you?

53
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,956
I want to serve as your general.

54
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,126
The last general I trusted...

55
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,212
betrayed me.

56
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,549
I will not make that mistake.

57
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:07,518
I cannot escape this curse
until I am immortal...

58
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,812
General.

59
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,524
I understand, my Lord.

60
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,695
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

61
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:22,450
This will point the way.

62
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,940
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

63
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,527
Prove yourself to me.

64
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:34,923
Fire!

65
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:49,313
Bazooka!

66
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,903
RICK: Fall back!

67
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,623
Alex! Follow me!

68
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,992
Set up a crossfire!

69
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,952
Move it!

70
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:10,412
Please! I need your help!

71
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,706
These soldiers are evil!

72
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,895
Shoot! Kill them!

73
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:28,842
Yes! Yes! Yes!

74
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,977
Shangri-La.

75
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,047
Mother.

76
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:43,591
My sweet daughter.

77
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,560
I beg you...

78
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:57,188
My father is dying.

79
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,940
They are my friends.

80
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:05,006
Where are you going, General?
Our destiny awaits.

81
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:50,260
I was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

82
01:13:50,802 --> 01:13:52,303
No, mother.

83
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,557
I would do anything for you.

84
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:05,139
You look tired, you should rest.

85
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,308
I'll stay.

86
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:10,645
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

87
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,272
If we are to defeat the Emperor...

88
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:17,193
I must ask for one more sacrifice.

89
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,861
Anything, mother.

90
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,865
Your immortality.

91
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,866
General Ming's daughter.

92
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,035
Your child will be mine.

93
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:41,248
AWAKE!

94
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,638
Today you awake to a world...

95
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,725
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

96
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:30,149
I will restore order...

97
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,152
I will retake what is mine.

98
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,489
I will crush any idea of freedom.

99
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,166
I will slaughter without mercy.

100
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,002
I will conquer without compassion.

101
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,671
I will now lead you past the Great Wall.

102
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:56,634
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

103
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:05,351
I raised you for one purpose...

104
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,395
to enforce my will on the entire world!

105
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:10,523
Long live the Emperor!

106
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,891
Zi Yuan.

107
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:53,899
It's General Ming!

108
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,943
Follow General Ming!

109
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,409
Prepare for battle!

110
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:27,266
Zi Yuan?

111
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,089
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

112
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:03,469
Archers form up!

113
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:44,260
Death to General Ming!

114
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:49,682
Charge!

115
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,297
We can't let them cross the wall!

116
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:49,468
You are no longer immortal.

117
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,888
Pierce through his heart.

118
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:29,229
You must live and fight on.

119
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:08,810
Get in!

120
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:12,397
The O'Connells are going to
stop the Emperor!

121
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:26,888
I dug you up...

122
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:30,267
and I'm gonna put you down.

123
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,403
Let go!

124
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,571
Never!

125
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,371
The Emperor is dead.

126
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:21,331
The Emperor is dead!
