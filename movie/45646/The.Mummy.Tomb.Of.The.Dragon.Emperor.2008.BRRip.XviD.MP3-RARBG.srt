-My fault?

You're the one
that's always smothering him.

353
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,853
You couldn't leave him alone
for five minutes without wiping his nose.

354
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,690
Perhaps I was overcompensating for the fact
that you never took an interest in his life.

355
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,443
His life was my top priority.

356
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,112
How many times did I save that kid
from breaking his neck?

357
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,448
A little warmth and encouragement
would have been nice.

So, Mom, why don't you stick around
for the next few days,

400

that we're here. You know...

that you had gone legit,

No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people.
You can't do this.

that only a drop of blood

can open the Eye.

-You did pretty well off it.
-Good point.

The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in
a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

Beyond it is a golden tower.

Once the diamond is placed at the top,
it will point the way to Shangri-La.

he and the Emperor will go.

01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:30,265
and I'm gonna put you down.

1044
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:47,282
(SCREAMING)

1045
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,340
Alex? Alex!

1046
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,613
(GRUNTING)

1047
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,661
(CHOKING)

1048
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,234
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

1049
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:05,401
Let go!

1050
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,569
Never!

1051
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:13,451
RICK: Enough tricks! Where's your honor?

1052
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,289
Fight like a man!

1053
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:26,214
(RICK GRUNTING)

1054
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:58,705
Divide

1055
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,749
and conquer.

1056
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,541
(EMPEROR GROANING)

1057
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:51,257
Now you can rule in hell.

1058
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:17,533
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

1059
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:19,369
The Emperor is dead.

1060
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:21,329
The Emperor is dead!

1061
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:00,368
(SINGING)

1062
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:12,380
-Evening, girls. You're looking well.
-WOMAN: Good evening, Mr. Maguire.

1063
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:17,051
-It's a fine night to be me.
-You dance great for an old lady.

1064
01:40:17,594 --> 01:40:20,138
Someone told me to stop living
on the sidelines.

1065
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:23,266
-Well, he sounds like a smart guy.
-He is.

1066
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,781
So I guess Dash and Scarlet
have their next adventure?

1067
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:41,743
Why write about it when you can live it?

1068
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,081
There's something incredibly romantic
about vanquishing the undead.

1069
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,501
Even more romantic doing it with you.

1070
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:54,130
-Kiss me.
-Don't have to ask me twice.

1071
01:41:03,265 --> 01:41:04,932
-Can I get your bag, sir?
-No, no, no.

1072
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:07,018
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

1073
01:41:07,102 --> 01:41:08,144
Where are you off to, Mr. Carnahan?

1074
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,605
Someplace where they don't have mummies.

1075
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:13,524
-Step on it! I've got a plane to catch.
-DRIVER: Yes, sir.

1076
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:17,278
Yeah. Ciao, ciao, Shanghai.

1077
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:19,530
Peru, here I come.

1078
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:26,996
Soon after, mummies were found in Peru.
