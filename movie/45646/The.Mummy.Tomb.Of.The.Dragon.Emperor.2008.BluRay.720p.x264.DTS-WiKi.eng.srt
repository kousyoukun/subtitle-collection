2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,670
Long ago, a mythic battle between good and evil

3
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,550
played out in ancient China.

4
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,170
The country was torn by civil war,

5
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,870
with many kingdoms struggling for land and power.

6
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:00,280
But one king had a ruthless ambition to make himself emperor by the sword.


8
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,600
Leave me.

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,220
Prepare for war!

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,890
NARRATOR... The other rulers hired assassins to kill the King

11
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,000
before he could conquer them all.

12
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,100
Stop! I am not harmed.

13
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
We attack tonight!

14
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,930
NARRATOR... Kingdom by kingdom, his army swept away everything in its path,

15
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,250
and anyone who resisted met a terrible fate.

16
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,750
The country was his.

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,410
He was now Emperor of All Under Heaven.

18
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,410
He enslaved his conquered enemies and forced them to build his Great Wall.

19
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,820
When they were dead or useless, he had them buried beneath it.

20
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,290
The Emperor's mystics taught him mastery over the five elements,

21
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,970
fire, water, earth, wood and metal.

22
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,790
His power seemed without limit.

23
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,790
He was master of millions,

24
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,060
but like the lowliest peasant, he could not stop growing old.

25
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,040
I have too much to do for one lifetime.

26
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,520
NARRATOR... He needed to defeat his last enemy, death itself.

27
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,690
One day, news came of a powerful witch

28
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,320
who was rumoured to know the secret to eternal life.

29
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,040
He ordered General Ming, his oldest friend and trusted ally, to find her.

30
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,300
The witch was named Zi Yuan,

31
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,960
and she was nothing like the General expected.

32
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,620
Your Majesty...

33
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,350
Rise up.

34
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,790
I do not possess the secret of immortality, my Lord...

35
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,230
...but I know where to find it.

36
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,720
General...

37
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,990
No man is to touch her.

38
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,930
She is mine.

39
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,350
NARRATOR... On the western border stood the Monastery of Turfan.

40
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,430
There was housed the greatest library in the ancient world,

41
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,130
and Zi Yuan was sure the secret to eternal life was here.

42
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,900
This is a key.

43
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,320
NARRATOR... It was the long lost oracle bones,

44
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,740
a collection of all the mystical secrets of the ancient world.

45
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,760
The Emperor's answer was here along with other magic beyond imagining.

46
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,840
You have served me well.

47
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,670
I will grant you anything you desire.

48
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,790
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

49
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,620
Of course.

50
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,230
Read.

51
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,660
NARRATOR... She cast the spell in Sanskrit,

52
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,190
an ancient language that the Emperor did not understand.

53
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,340
I feel your spell working.

54
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,590
I am now immortal.

55
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,840
Come, I want to show you something.


57
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,090
Become my queen and I will let him live.

58
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,320
Do what he says! Save yourself!

59
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,610
You will never keep your word.

60
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,260
You are right.

61
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,260
Now, join General Ming in hell.


63
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,250
What did you do to me?

64
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,370
I cursed you and your army.

65
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,120
Surround the Palace!

66
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,030
The Emperor is in trouble!

67
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,570
NARRATOR... The curse must never be lifted,

68
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,150
or the Emperor will rise again to enslave all of mankind.

69
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,470
On that dark day, there will be nothing and no one to save us.


71
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,960
You can run, but you can't hide.

72
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,380
One o'clock.

73
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,580
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND

74
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,960
Ten o'clock, one o'clock. Ten o'clock, one...

75
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,360
And this is something for grown men to do?

76
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,900
Come on.

77
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,220
Bite on this.

78
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,510
Evy, I'm home!

79
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,630
Mrs O'Connell is at her book reading, sir. She'll be home for dinner.

80
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,870
Oh, right. Well, that's great, 'cause we're having fish.

81
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,460
You didn't think I'd catch anything, did you?

82
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,490
I had the utmost confidence, sir.

83
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,360
JAMESON: There's a hook in your neck, sir. Shall I fetch the wire cutters?

84
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,380
RICK... Fall back! Follow me! Move! Move! Move! Move!

85
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,900
EVELYN..."Now safely aboard the airship with the mummy finally vanquished,

86
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,470
LONDON

87
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,770
"Dash swept Scarlet into his arms.

88
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,380
"'Oh, God, Scarlet, I thought I'd lost you.' 'For a moment there, you did.'

89
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,270
"Bathed in rays of golden sunlight,

90
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,430
"our heroes sealed their reunion with a kiss of timeless passion,

91
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,460
"their love deeper and truer than ever."

92
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,000
Mrs O'Connell, we're all dying to know,

93
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,990
is the Scarlet O'Keefe character really based on you?

94
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,500
Honestly, I can say she's a completely different person.

95
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,580
- Any more questions? - WO Mrs O'Connell...

96
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,610
Mrs O'Connell, is your life today as exciting as it was before the war?

97
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,080
I wish my life were that exciting now.

98
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,570
Will there be another book in the series?

99
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,630
WOMAN 2: Do you believe in happy endings?

100
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,810
Isn't this blissful?

101
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,810
Dinner at home.

102
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,510
- Every night. - Every night.

103
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,120
- Here's to retirement. - May we stay this happy forever.

104
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Still no letter from Alex. I've sent him three in the last month.

105
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,550
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

106
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,760
The only time we ever hear from that kid

107
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,050
is when he's getting kicked out of college or he needs more money.

108
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,570
I'm sure he's just buried in his studies.

109
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,110
- So, how did your book reading go? - Oh, fine. Thank you.

110
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,570
Until they asked me, "When will there be another Mummy adventure?"

111
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,200
Yeah, but you did promise the publisher a third book.

112
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,360
I know.

113
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,780
But I spend my nights staring at a blank page, completely blocked.

114
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:37,020
We could skip dinner, and I could

115
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,800
attempt to inspire you upstairs.

116
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,310
Oh, that's so sweet of you, darling.

117
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,420
But I'm going to sit at that typewriter until something exciting comes out.

118
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,130
Thank you.

119
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Trout. How lovely!

120
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,410
I'm so happy you found a hobby that doesn't involve guns.

121
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,900
NINGXIA PROVINCE, CHINA

122
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,100
Don't worry, we'll find the entrance today.

123
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,780
Li Tung, what's for lunch?

124
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,230
Noodle soup.

125
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,140
Very good.

126
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,300
ALEX: Good. Wilson's back.

127
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,560
You're a couple days late, Professor.

128
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,140
I was beginning to think you'd run into bandits.

129
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,220
Oh, my dear fellow, thank you for the concern.

130
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,010
- Are you thirsty? - Oh, yes, please.

131
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,540
- Here you go. - Thank you.

132
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,340
You know, when I saw you standing up there,

133
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,590
I thought I was looking at your father.

134
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,420
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.

135
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,340
Yeah, well, hopefully after today, he'll be known as Alex O'Connell's father.

136
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,130
What a powerful face!

137
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,560
When I told my colleagues at the museum that you had discovered the Colossus,

138
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,830
they were thrilled.

139
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,120
- Yes, however... - I know.

140
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,290
When am I gonna get in that tomb?

141
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,410
Don't let the buggers get you down.

142
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,910
It was you that discovered the Bembridge journal,

143
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,490
and with it, you'll discover the Emperor.

144
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,730
- I have complete faith in you, Alex. - Thank you, Professor.

145
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,140
Thanks for believing in me.

146
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,390
We found it! We found the door!

147
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,430
Bad Mummy.

148
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,340
Yeah.

149
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,800
Vile Mummy?

150
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,350
No. Cursed Mummy!

151
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,540
Mysterious Mummy.

152
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,920
Malignant Mummy.

153
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,370
Prepare to die!

154
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,580
Take that!

155
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,270
Rick!

156
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,070
Darling, where are you?

157
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,930
I'm ready to be inspired.

158
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,270
Do you remember the time the mummy had me tied down?

159
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,310
And you came to save me and you cut...

160
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,640
No! You tore open the ropes is what you did,

161
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,960
just as he was about to plunge his...

162
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, rats.

163
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,100
Watch out!

164
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,540
- Emperor didn't want any houseguests. - Yeah.

165
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,830
Stay together.

166
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,160
Sir Colin Bembridge.

167
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,410
Oh, gee...

168
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,210
He went searching for this tomb 70 years ago.

169
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,250
They left him like this as a warning.

170
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,120
Unfortunately, this is not the dead man that's gonna make us famous.

171
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
Let's keep moving.

172
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
Look at it, Alex.

173
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,120
Look at it!

174
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,260
Chu Wah!


176
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,790
- Chu Wah. - No, no, don't, don't, don't.

177
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,580
Alex, Alex, they're dead! Come on.

178
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,790
This kind of danger goes with the territory. You know that better than anyone.

179
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,560
Alex!

180
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,030
- Yes? - Okay.

181
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,940
- Yes? - Yeah.

182
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,140
All right, good chap. Okay. Good chap. Oh, Jesus.

183
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,320
All the warriors are facing in to this point,

184
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,730
- as if awaiting an order from the Emperor. - Well, then, where is he?

185
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,010
Listen, you don't think some bloody grave robber's

186
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,390
beaten us to the prize, do you?

187
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,180
No, he's still here.

188
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,880
You see, this is a feng shui compass.

189
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,220
Okay. Now. This...

190
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,210
Okay, this is true north,

191
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,540
but the feng shui compass is set in the opposite direction.

192
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,710
- All right, we need to realign it. - All right.

193
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,280
- All right, here we go. - All right.

194
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,220
Alex! Alex, speak to me!

195
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,470
Are you all right?

196
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,130
- Alex! - I'm fine.

197
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,830
Tell me, have we found the Emperor?

198
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,920
Alex!

199
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,550
What is it?

200
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,000
It's only the greatest find since King Tut!

201
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,380
"If he is awakened, all mortals should despair."

202
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,820
It's definitely him!

203
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,160
Even had his concubines buried alive with him.

204
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,030
Selfish bastard.

205
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,370
Hey, Professor Wilson, you want to come down and take a look?

206
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,020
Or are you so overwhelmed you can't talk?

207
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,300
Wilson!

208
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,010
Let's go, Professor. We've got a lot of work to do.

209
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,410
WILSON: All right.

210
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,620
FRY: First of all, I'd just like to say

211
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,960
that the Foreign Office appreciates all that you did during the war.

212
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,780
But I've been sent to offer you one last assignment.

213
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,470
I'm afraid we've retired from the espionage game, haven't we, dear?

214
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,710
Yeah, we've... We don't do that any more. We're finished.

215
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,550
- EVELYN: Not at all. - Completely done.

216
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,400
But just out of curiosity, what is the mission anyway?

217
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,220
We need you to courier this to Shanghai.

218
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,650
- Nice piece of ice. - It's the Eye of Shangri-La.

219
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,240
If you believe the legend, it points the way to the Pool of Eternal Life.

220
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,490
It was smuggled out of China in 1940.

221
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,330
Now, the government would like to return it to the Shanghai Museum

222
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,830
as a sign of good faith to the Chinese people.

223
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,830
And with your expertise in the field, we naturally thought of you.

224
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,250
Oh, we'd be so flattered.

225
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,770
But Rick and I, we made a promise to each other after the war

226
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,930
that we would settle down.

227
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,850
- That's right, yeah, we did, didn't we? We... - I see.

228
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,850
Well, I must admit I am a little disappointed.

229
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,360
Postwar China is very dangerous.

230
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,810
There are a lot of factions that would love

231
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,360
to get their hands on the Eye of Shangri-La.

232
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,480
In lesser hands, the Eye could be lost forever.

233
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,530
We couldn't let that happen, could we?

234
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,040
No, that could be bad for the world.

235
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,690
- The world... Terrible. - Yeah.

236
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,960
You know, she has a brother who lives in Shanghai.

237
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,880
- Jonathan! - Yes.

238
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,830
He owns a nightclub, if I'm not mistaken.

239
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,380
We have been meaning to visit. We could...

240
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,760
- We should... ...drop in and surprise him.

241
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,510
- Say hello. - Why not?

242
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,300
Does this mean we can count on you one last time?

243
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,660
Yes.

244
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,690
SHANGHAI, CHINA

245
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,130
CHINESE NEW YEAR, 1947

246
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,190
There we are.

247
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,590
Here's to you, Princess.

248
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,340
And Imhotep. May the bugger actually stay dead.

249
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,010
Ding-dong.

250
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,600
Hi, can you buy a drink for me?

251
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,990
Excuse me. Alex! Alex! You're back again.

252
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,530
Come here, Alex. Let me get you a drink.

253
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,520
Smooth special for the pup, huh? The explorer.

254
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,660
Make that two.

255
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,290
Sorry, Uncle Jon, but I got a better offer.

256
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,080
JONATHAN: No, no, Alex. No, look. Listen, how can I... Come here.

257
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
To put it in archaeological terms,

258
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,260
that's a tomb in which many pharaohs have lain.

259
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,250
Now, listen, listen, just think about me for a moment, all right?

260
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,150
Your discovery will go public in a few days

261
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,140
and your parents are sure to find out.

262
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,760
They're not gonna be happy you've dropped out of school. And...

263
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,680
Will you relax, Uncle Jon? Okay? I'm here. They're a long way away.

264
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,610
- Alex... - Excuse me, okay?

265
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,390
I have some excavation to do.

266
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,900
Jonathan!

267
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,920
You're in China! Evy. Rick.

268
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,370
What are you... It's so... I didn't even...

269
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,670
Brother, how lovely to see you.

270
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,510
I had no idea he was here!

271
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,450
- Who was here? - Who?

272
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,500
This happens every time!

273
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,180
Every man in the bar!

274
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,350
- Dad? - Alex!

275
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,100
I don't know what to do with you! WO He's just a boy!

276
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,520
- I can't leave the room for 10 minutes! - I didn't... Go away! Go to hell!

277
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,650
-  I'm sick of it! - Let's go get lover-boy!

278
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,690
I'm gonna kill you, kid!

279
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,440
Not so fast, that's my kid.

280
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,770
- Mad Dog Maguire? - Ricochet O'Connell.

281
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,370
- Hey, hey. - EVELYN: What are you doing here?

282
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,790
Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?

283
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,320
Just a little family get-together, folks.

284
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,240
Come on, let's get back to having a good time. Music!

285
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,370
How long has it been?

286
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,700
Egypt, '23. French Foreign Legion.

287
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,630
This guy could land a plane on anything, you...

288
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,350
- Why are you here? - Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.

289
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,720
Now, son or no son, I gotta give him a beating!

290
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,130
- Get out of the way, Dad. - Sit down.

291
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,980
Now as much as I'd really like you to teach him a valuable lesson...

292
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,720
His mother would be upset! Very upset.

293
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,350
You have a lot of explaining to do, young man.

294
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,650
I got a wife now, and a kid.

295
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,900
Things are a little bit different, I'm sure you understand.

296
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,090
- Yeah. - Let me make it up to you.

297
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,110
We're just surprised to see you here. That's all.

298
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,610
JONATHAN: Who's gonna pay for all this damage?

299
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,990
All right?

300
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm not here five minutes,

301
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,080
and I'm already pulling your fanny out of the fire.

302
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,200
You're going back to college.

303
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,770
How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?

304
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,460
You two show up, tell me what to do?

305
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,000
No. But we should sit down and discuss this like a family.

306
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,880
No offence, Mom, but we haven't been a family in a long time.

307
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,000
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!

308
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,830
Alex, just... Alex, come here.

309
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,330
Can you...

310
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,840
Don't look at me like that.

311
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,690
- It's all your fault! - My fault?

312
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,480
You're the one that's always smothering him.

313
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,110
You couldn't leave him alone for five minutes without wiping his nose.

314
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,980
Perhaps I was overcompensating for the fact

315
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,940
that you never took an interest in his life.

316
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,700
His life was my top priority.

317
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,370
How many times did I save that kid from breaking his neck?

318
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,710
A little warmth and encouragement would have been nice.

319
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,900
I'm his father. It's implied.

320
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,500
We've spent our entire lives searching for priceless artefacts,

321
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,180
and the one thing that's most precious to us,

322
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,700
we've lost.

323
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,410
We can't let Alex become some stranger

324
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,420
in pictures on our mantle.

325
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,510
- We can't let that happen. - No, we can't.

326
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,140
How are we gonna fix this?

327
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,930
We need to do it together.

328
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,810
PARAMILITARY OUTPOST WESTERN CHINA

329
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,180
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

330
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,850
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

331
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,730
Our spy says they do.

332
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,990
Good.

333
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,240
Assemble the troops!

334
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,760
Yes sir.

335
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,300
Soldiers!

336
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,320
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

337
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,530
will bear great fruit.

338
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,830
It is my dream to raise our Emperor from his tomb.

339
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,670
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

340
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,740
Soldiers...

341
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,660
tonight our great battle begins!

342
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,940
You know, this might have been faster if we took a rickshaw.

343
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,370
It's Chinese New Year.

344
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,490
Don't you just love this country?

345
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,950
They have so many extra little holidays, and drinking is mandatory.

346
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,620
I can't believe we get to see your first big discovery.

347
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,750
It's so exciting.

348
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,720
Well, after last night, I'm surprised you want to see it at all.

349
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,420
JONATHAN: Listen, I'll pick you up in about an hour.

350
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,790
EVELYN: You're not coming?

351
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,620
JONATHAN: No, no, I've seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.

352
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,380
There he is.

353
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,430
Oh, my darling, very impressive.

354
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,690
When do you get to open the sarcophagus?

355
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,820
ALEX: Well, after the official red tape has been cut.

356
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,200
Do the words "rest in peace" mean anything to you two?

357
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,990
So, Mom, why don't you stick around for the next few days,

358
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,330
and we can open it together?

359
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,830
I would like that very much, thanks.

360
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,200
Alex, why don't you go and tell Professor Wilson

361
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,380
that we're here. You know...

362
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,830
No problem. Great.

363
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,500
Just don't wake the big guy up while I'm gone.

364
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,710
Hey, Alex.

365
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:41,010
You know, this is all really, really big stuff.

366
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,430
Whatever you say, Dad.

367
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,760
What?

368
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,780
You just have a certain glow about you this evening

369
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,810
I haven't seen in a long time.

370
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,230
I guess mummies bring out the best in me.

371
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,980
Take a wrong turn at Cairo? Sorry to interrupt.

372
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,160
- Roger. - Professor Roger Wilson.

373
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,580
Rick.

374
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,210
You know, when Alex told me that you had gone legit,

375
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,330
I just couldn't believe my ears.

376
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,130
Well, now I just pillage tombs in the name of preservation. Evelyn.

377
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,340
- Congratulations on your latest discovery. - Alex deserves all the credit.

378
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,510
He's one hell of a kid. He's like the son I never had.

379
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,930
And he's the only one we've got,

380
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,050
so the next time you send him on one of your field trips,

381
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,440
you give us the heads-up first.

382
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,890
Yes, yes, of course.

383
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,400
And now, I believe you have something that belongs to us.

384
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,070
What's that?

385
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,180
Oh, you mean this?

386
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,350
I'm sorry...

387
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,410
There, go ahead.

388
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,690
All yours, Rog.

389
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,230
I knew I could rely on you two.

390
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,540
I'm afraid your work is not done yet, Mr and Mrs O'Connell.

391
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,550
I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine. General Yang.

392
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,210
Roger!

393
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:45,040
Well, he is the man who financed Alex's dig. We're in this together.

394
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,930
Cheek by jowl. General.

395
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,420
Search him.

396
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,060
No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people. You can't do this.

397
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,650
So, Rog, you snake, how much did...

398
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,530
Is it Yin and Yang? ...pay you?

399
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,160
Enough to pull strings at the Foreign Office,

400
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,670
make sure that it was you two who delivered the Eye. Turn around.

401
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,150
The Eye contains the elixir from the Pool of Eternal Life.

402
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,040
I need you to open it, Mrs O'Connell.

403
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
No.

404
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,180
You're going to use it to wake the Emperor, aren't you?

405
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,440
And his Terracotta Army. At least, that's the general idea.

406
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,460
Raising an army of mummies is insane. Listen, Yang...

407
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,930
Easy! Go easy.

408
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,890
Time to open the sarcophagus. Move!

409
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,770
Read the inscription! Now!

410
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,170
Ancient Chinese isn't my forte.

411
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,200
Here's some encouragement. Wilson!

412
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,010
I'll do it!

413
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,200
No, Evy, don't do it! They're just gonna kill me, anyway.

414
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,570
The inscription says that only a drop of blood

415
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,260
from a person of pure heart can open the Eye.

416
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,310
Your husband was right.

417
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,680
No!

418
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,030
Only the pure of heart would sacrifice themselves for the one they love.

419
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,910
Open it.

420
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,390
You never called after our last date.

421
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,800
I don't have time for games, Alex.

422
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,270
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

423
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,560
It's Lin.

424
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,190
You want to explain to me why you tried to kill me?

425
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,400
We could do that.

426
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,680
Or we could save your parents.

427
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,370
Wilson, you son of a bitch!

428
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,040
- Get on with it, O'Connell. - All right.

429
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,560
Once this touches him, the Emperor will rise to rule again.

430
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,670
Finish him off.

431
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,640
Alex, please! Don't. That's...

432
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,070
Don't, don't. Don't, please.

433
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,200
No, don't, Alex, it's me. Please.

434
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,450
It's not him. This is a eunuch! It's a decoy!

435
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,480
Where the hell's the Emperor?

436
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,060
Stay!

437
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,570
Here we go again.

438
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,340
I live to serve you, my Lord.

439
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,020
I can help you become immortal.

440
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,340
If you are lying, you will burn.

441
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:59,200
Wait! Wait! You wait for me! I'm coming with you! Wait, wait...

442
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,470
Watch out!

443
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,230
RICK: We got to put this mummy down fast!

444
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,290
The longer we wait, the stronger they get!

445
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,110
Open the gate! Open the gate!


447
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Sorry, pal. There's a mummy on the loose.

448
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,260
- You wanna drive? - Why not?

449
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,130
God, I love a woman who can drive a truck.

450
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,550
Hey, pal, I'm really sorry, but you know what? Happy New Year!

451
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,320
Hit it, honey!

452
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,380
No! Move over!

453
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,940
What? No!

454
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,760
No!

455
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,180
No!

456
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,270
- What? - Jonathan, get in the back!

457
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,330
Sorry about the Rolls!

458
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,230
You guys are like mummy magnets!

459
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,490
- We have to turn you around! - Okay.

460
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,790
Excuse me.

461
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,970
- Hey, we could use this! - Give me that!

462
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,320
- Oh, yeah, that's a better idea. - RICK: Size counts!

463
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,720
Stop mucking about! They're getting away!

464
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,400
Just drive!

465
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,860
RICK: Aim for the Emperor! JONATHAN: Aim for the Emperor?

466
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,610
- Light it up, Jonathan! - I'm trying!

467
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,220
Fire!

468
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,970
Did we get him?

469
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,180
- Fire! - What, again?

470
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
- Your ass is on fire! - My ass?

471
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,140
- Hold still! - Rick, my ass is on fire!

472
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,680
- Well, spank my... - I'm putting it out!

473
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,520
- Put me out, Rick! - Just hold still!

474
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,900
Spank my ass! Spank my ass!

475
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,350
All right, here I come!

476
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,100
LIN: Give me your hand!

477
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,350
Come on!

478
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,360
Watch out!

479
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,000
RICK: Evy, where are you going?

480
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,620
- Taking a short cut! - Evy!

481
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,720
- I told you it was a short cut! - Right!

482
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,090
Now he's chasing us!

483
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,850
Hurry!

484
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,270
Give me your hand. Here, you're gonna need these.

485
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,240
- Don't wait up for me. - Where are you going?

486
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
Out!

487
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,660
- Where's Rick? - Where do you think?

488
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,250
Damn it!

489
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
You're mine!

490
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,270
- Give me your hand and get on this horse! - Get back, Dad!

491
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,720
Alexander Rupert O'Connell, you get on the back of this horse this instant!

492
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,270
Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Oh, God!

493
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,690
JONATHAN: Evy!

494
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,960
We've got to go back and help Rick!

495
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,330
JONATHAN: Rick! Forget Rick! Here they come!

496
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,140
I'll go after the Emperor.

497
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,970
Trust me. I've got a little more experience with mummies.

498
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,560
And I have the only weapon that can kill him.

499
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,460
Okay. I'll cover you. Let's go!

500
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,980
ALEX: Lin!

501
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,410
- I thought you were dead! - He missed.

502
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,820
LIN: Look out!

503
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,850
Thanks, Rick. Could you get the cab?

504
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,610
Does it look like I have a wallet?

505
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,520
You know, I would have killed the Emperor

506
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,980
if you two hadn't blown my cover.

507
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,320
I had everything under control.

508
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,660
Oh, yeah, that's exactly what we were thinking.

509
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,570
Yeah, well, good going, you raised another mummy.

510
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,610
And this bugger's got superpowers.

511
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,950
ALEX: He's got control over fire, water, metal and who knows what else.

512
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,120
And you dug him up anyway.

513
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,950
Yeah, well, you're not gonna pin this one on me, okay, Dad?

514
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,290
- RICK: Am I? - Oh, stop it, you two.

515
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,790
No one's to blame here. Wilson manipulated all of us.

516
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, that's true.

517
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,170
I apologise for my parents.

518
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,500
But I thought we worked really well together.

519
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,750
Except we failed.

520
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,840
I'm sorry, we haven't been properly introduced.

521
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,520
- Who are you exactly? - My name is Lin.

522
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,970
My family has watched over the Emperor's tomb for centuries.

523
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,400
The Emperor cannot be killed unless he is stabbed through the heart with this.

524
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,600
My mother put a curse on it long ago.

525
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,010
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,610
Well, a quick family meeting, Alex.

527
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,900
- Sit. - Down.

528
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,540
What do you really know about this girl?

529
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,280
Well, not much,

530
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,380
but after her help tonight, I'm willing to go on a little faith.

531
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,340
- Faith. - Time is running out.

532
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,920
You don't really believe in the concept of personal space, do you?

533
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,510
If the Emperor reaches Shangri-La and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,

534
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,470
he will raise his army and no one will be safe.

535
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,100
Much as I'd like to stay this boyishly handsome forever,

536
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,640
Shangri-La is a crock.

537
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,680
Yeah, but that's what you used to say about mummies, too, Jon.

538
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,900
- You did pretty well off it. - Good point.

539
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,410
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

540
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,650
Beyond it is a golden tower.

541
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,450
Once the diamond is placed at the top, it will point the way to Shangri-La.

542
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,580
Yang still has the diamond,

543
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,080
and that's where he and the Emperor will go.

544
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,250
She's right.

545
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,420
All the legends of the Eye mention the Gateway.

546
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,670
I like her, Alex. She knows what's what.

547
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:48,260
Now, just say that we were to believe you, could you guide us there?

548
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,170
Yes. I have been there once. I remember the way.

549
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,060
Himalayas. We're going to need a plane.

550
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,350
Well, I know just the Mad Dog for the job.

551
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,230
MAGUIRE: Well, any self-respecting pilot would land on the valley floor,

552
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,070
but I don't have any self-respect,

553
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,400
so I'll put you down halfway up the mountain.

554
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,240
That should give us a good advantage.

555
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,410
MAGUIRE: Of course, I can't guarantee any of us will live.

556
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,100
Great!

557
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,730
I'd tell you to fasten your seatbelts, but I was too cheap to buy any!

558
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,910
- Why am I laughing? - Here we go!

559
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,010
RICK: Mad Dog, Mad Dog! Ease up, ease up, ease up!

560
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,960
JONATHAN: Oh, God!

561
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,470
JONATHAN: Maguire!

562
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,690
Come on, man!

563
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,440
Mad Dog!

564
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,170
RICK: Brake! No, no! Nobody move.

565
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,400
Nobody move, nobody move!

566
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,090
What is that God-awful smell?

567
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,090
The yak yakked.

568
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,850
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

569
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,240
Why did you raise me?

570
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,940
I love this land. Only you can lead us back to greatness.

571
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,190
What is in it for you?

572
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,570
I want to serve as your general.

573
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,540
The last general I trusted...

574
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,830
betrayed me.

575
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,170
I will not make that mistake.

576
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:07,130
I cannot escape this curse until I am immortal...

577
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:09,430
General.

578
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,940
I understand, my Lord.

579
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,300
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

580
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,060
This will point the way.

581
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,850
Can't you see it's Mr McGuire

582
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,770
come to court your sister Kate

583
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:51,350
You know very well he owns the farm a wee bit out...

584
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,860
MAGUIRE O VER RADIO... Delta-Tango-Alpha to Ricochet. Come in, Ricochet.

585
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,960
Delta-Tango-Alpha, this is Ricochet. Go ahead, Mad Dog.

586
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,500
Yeah, you know that Yang fellow you told me to keep me eye out for?

587
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,790
He's just shown up.

588
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,130
Ricochet out. Thanks, Mad Dog.

589
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,880
That's us, people! Let's go!

590
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,210
- Jonathan, wake up! - What...

591
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,540
Hold the line!

592
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,810
Good, we're a little more than halfway.

593
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,850
We're gonna... We're gonna camp up there for the night.

594
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,870
ALEX: Lin says if we leave at first light, we'll reach the Gateway by noon.

595
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,960
Did she happen to mention how she knows so much about the Gateway?

596
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,250
No, not really. Kind of mysterious.

597
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,790
She's certainly managed to enchant you.

598
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,640
Come on, Alex. You obviously like her.

599
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,180
Mom, the thin mountain air, clearly messing with your head.

600
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,270
Whatever secret she's hiding,

601
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,230
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

602
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,780
I appreciate that, but, you know,

603
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,910
I've had my fair share of experience with the opposite sex.

604
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,570
Really?

605
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,120
How many experiences are we talking about?

606
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,510
Well, you shouldn't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to

607
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,220
okay, Mom?

608
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,820
Right.

609
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,830
Hey, Mom.

610
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,460
I'm sorry I blamed you guys for raising the Emperor.

611
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,310
What's so funny?

612
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,500
My mother is under the impression there's something between us.

613
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,990
I hope nothing romantic.

614
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:26,170
Yeah, well, I told her there was no chance of that.

615
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,620
We're complete opposites, you and me, right?

616
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:34,160
You guard tombs. I raid them. You like ancient knives. I'm into guns.

617
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,930
Those are some pretty insurmountable odds.

618
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,670
- Absolutely. - Well, good.

619
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,350
Now that we've cleared that up, we can focus on taking down the Emperor.

620
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,470
I agree totally.

621
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,810
Besides, you're not my type.

622
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,890
Of course not. You don't like a woman who can knock you on your backside.

623
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,600
The expression is "kick my ass."

624
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,110
And for the record, you didn't.

625
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,670
Yeah, it's not easy being me, you know.

626
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,470
Then again, I don't suppose it's easy being you,

627
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,710
is it, Geraldine, old girl?

628
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,010
If I'd met a girl like you, Geraldine...

629
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,420
You know, hard-working, you don't say much,

630
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,880
you're a little bit hairy, but I don't mind that.

631
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,230
There it is! We found it!

632
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,240
The Gateway of Shangri-La!

633
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,300
JONATHAN: Go, girl! Go! You're free!

634
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,000
Go, Geraldine! Live free!

635
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,890
What did you do now? Rob an armoury?

636
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,030
Have you ever seen a Walther P38?

637
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,360
Looks pretty anaemic compared to the Peacekeeper.

638
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,230
Well, it's not about size, Dad. It's about stamina.

639
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,280
You want power?

640
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:37,380
I give you the Thompson submachine gun. Fifty rounds a drum.

641
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,630
- Twenty-five a mag. - Tommy's good, Dad,

642
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,420
but the cocking mechanism always jams.

643
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,890
Here. Check out the Russian PPS Personal Assault Weapon.

644
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,680
Now, this is the future right here.

645
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,140
You know, it's experience that wins the day. It's not all about firepower.

646
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,180
Boys! If I may...

647
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,150
Do we have a plan for the Emperor?

648
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,190
Yeah. We're gonna hit him high, hard and fast

649
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,020
and smash him like a Ming vase.

650
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,240
- And if that doesn't work? - We go to plan B.

651
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,490
Plan B! You go upstairs, you blow up that gold tower thing.

652
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,700
- You light it up. We blow the guy sky high! - Me?

653
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,830
- You! What? - Dad?

654
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,030
So if the explosion doesn't kill us, the avalanche will.

655
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,630
- You got a better idea? - Yeah. I do.

656
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,580
I say we ambush him with long-range rifles and silencers.

657
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,750
Long-range, that's a better idea.

658
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,910
Yeah, we can get in close, Dad.

659
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,120
- JONATHAN: Much better idea. - And then we can finish him off

660
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,840
- with Lin's dagger. - Look, I'm sorry,

661
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,590
I just don't put much faith in your girlfriend's magic dagger.

662
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,890
- Okay, Dad, she is not my girlfriend. - You say that now,

663
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,050
- but I still don't trust her. - Well, I do.

664
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,840
- So you should trust my judgement, okay? - Look, kid,

665
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,600
I've put down more mummies in my time than you.

666
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,100
You put down one mummy, Dad.

667
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,810
Yeah. Same mummy twice!

668
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,060
EVELYN: Hand me the green wire, will you, please?

669
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,610
Are you sure you know what you are doing?

670
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,860
Of course. I've done this a hundred times.

671
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,940
If the Emperor places the Eye up there, all will be lost.

672
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,540
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

673
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:13,080
Prove yourself to me.


675
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,060
Let's give a warm O'Connell welcome!


677
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,520
Fire!

678
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,900
Bazooka!

679
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,460
RICK: Fall back!

680
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,220
Alex! Follow me!


682
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,320
We gotta take out those bazookas!

683
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,570
Go!

684
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,000
Fall back!

685
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,630
Move! Move! Move! Move!

686
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:49,190
Time to go to plan B! Blow up the tower!

687
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,140
Hey, I'm actually a little bit concerned about plan B!

688
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,650
Couldn't we go straight to plan C?

689
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,770
Just make it go bang! I'll cover you!

690
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,220
Come on.

691
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,910
All right, let's go, go, go! Come on, come on!

692
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:03,230
Come on. Oh, be good.

693
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,590
Set up a crossfire!

694
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,500
Move it!

695
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,830
EVELYN: My last round!


697
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:03,680
- Abominable snowmen? - The Tibetans call them yeti!

698
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,990
Please! I need your help!

699
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,530
These soldiers are evil!

700
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,450
She speaks Yeti?

701
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,710
Shoot! Kill them!

702
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,350
Why do I always have to save the day?

703
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,310
I hate it when the kid's right!

704
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,230
Get the other guy!

705
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,400
Thanks!

706
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,040
Trouble!

707
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,170
You can die slow or you can die fast.


709
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,620
Yes! Yes! Yes!

710
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,450
Yeah! I did it!

711
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,460
Oh, Mother, I did it! Time for a retreat, I think.

712
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,180
I'm on your team! I'm a team player!

713
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:46,680
"One for all and all for me" kind of thing!

714
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,180
The dynamite, all this dynamite! We should get out of here!

715
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,340
Back off! Back off!

716
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,410
LIN: Run!

717
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:41,810
I hate mummies! They never play fair!

718
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:52,240
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

719
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:03,500
Over here! Over here! Come on! Over here!

720
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,670
Oh, no!

721
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,380
Rick!

722
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,790
Shangri-La.

723
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,220
That's a diamond.

724
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,270
I could use a diamond like that.

725
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,280
Dad!

726
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,350
Okay, hold it. Hold on there, Dad.

727
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,560
All right, please, please, please put pressure on it, okay, Dad?

728
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,380
RICK: It's all right, it's all right. We've been in tougher scrapes than this.

729
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,550
Avalanche!

730
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,300
- Help! Help me! - Lin!

731
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,890
Please! Help me!

732
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:09,970
Yes!

733
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,850
I've got it! And I'm still alive!

734
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,270
ALEX:  Help me, please. Somebody help me!

735
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:23,460
- We're over here! Over here! - Alex?

736
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,370
- ALEX: Mom, Mom, we're down here! - Alex?

737
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:28,320
We're over here!

738
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,000
Oh, God.

739
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:47,290
We've got to take him to Shangri-La now! It's our only chance.

740
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,240
We made it!

741
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,550
The Pool.

742
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,810
Mother.

743
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,350
My sweet daughter.

744
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,320
I beg you...

745
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,920
My father is dying.

746
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,690
They are my friends.

747
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,960
Oh, please.

748
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,490
go

749
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,790
Thank you.

750
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:42,240
He must rest. We'll take him to my chamber.

751
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:03,770
Where are you going, General? Our destiny awaits.

752
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,660
Well, it's not everyone that gets their brother-in-law back from the dead.

753
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,610
Yeah, give me my four score years and ten any day.

754
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,490
Is this Shangri-La?

755
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:37,290
I could live here. Lots of opportunity.

756
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,760
A casino.

757
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:49,010
I was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

758
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,070
No, mother.

759
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,310
I would do anything for you.

760
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,990
ALEX: He's resting well. Thank you.

761
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,760
How'd you get involved in all this?

762
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,300
The Emperor murdered the only man I ever loved, Lin's father.

763
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,220
I would have died, too, by his hand,

764
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,230
if the yeti had not found me and brought me to this pool.

765
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,390
Hang on a second. How did this all happen?

766
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:28,850
This was before Christ.

767
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,200
How long were you guarding his tomb?

768
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,350
Over 2,000 years.

769
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,410
The Emperor must never be allowed to reach the Pool,

770
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,420
or he will have the power to raise his army.

771
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,130
And once he becomes immortal,

772
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:53,260
he can transform himself into the most hideous creatures ever seen.

773
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:56,700
I will take the first watch at the entrance.

774
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,970
You know, I have no problem dating an older woman.

775
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,180
I'm afraid we can't be together.

776
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:15,680
Wait. What? Why?

777
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,940
Because I'm going to live forever.

778
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,030
I don't want to watch you die.

779
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,820
So what? That's it?

780
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,420
You're just gonna sit on the sidelines for eternity?

781
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,990
My mother has mourned my father for centuries.

782
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,290
I don't know if my heart can bear it.

783
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:44,130
People can live an entire lifetime in one look.

784
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,830
I watch my parents do it every day.

785
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,890
JONATHAN: Alex?

786
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,040
Your father's awake. Get up here!

787
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,160
Hello.

788
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:17,210
If this is heaven, it looks pretty good so far.

789
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:27,990
Nice to see some things never change.

790
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:48,600
Go easy on him. He feels terrible.

791
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,620
When I saw you lying there, Dad...

792
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,000
I've never been so scared in my life.

793
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,830
Well, that makes two of us.

794
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,430
I mean, you know, you're not supposed to die, you know?

795
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,550
You're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

796
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:12,890
You get beat up, you get tossed around,

797
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,600
but, well, you're always standing there in the end.

798
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,310
I never really thought of the world without you.

799
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,440
Alex,

800
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,140
the truth is,

801
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,360
I'm just trying to...

802
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,000
I'm just...

803
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,290
I'm trying to be a good husband.

804
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,750
I'm trying to be a good parent.

805
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:42,420
And the truth is, I've been dropping the ball lately, and...

806
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,460
No, you know, I haven't been the world's greatest son, you know?

807
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:49,600
No, no, that's 'cause you get it from her side of the family.

808
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,460
Come here.

809
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,470
My boys.

810
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:03,890
You look tired, you should rest.

811
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,060
I'll stay.

812
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:09,240
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

813
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,830
If we are to defeat the Emperor...

814
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:15,870
I must ask for one more sacrifice.

815
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,610
Anything, mother.

816
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,610
Your immortality.

817
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,800
Oh, no! His powers have been fully restored!

818
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,630
Time to go.

819
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,610
General Ming's daughter.

820
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,790
Your child will be mine.

821
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,580
He is immortal.

822
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:49,540
Hey! You three-headed shape-shifting son of a bitch!

823
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,290
Lin!

824
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,520
LIN: Alex!

825
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,220
Alex!

826
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,210
He's taking her back to his tomb to raise his army!

827
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,420
- Is there a faster way down from here? - The yeti. They'll help.

828
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:34,590
But he's already in the air. It'll be too late!

829
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:39,250
Mad Dog can outfly a three-headed lizard any day of the week! Let's go.

830
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,550
MAGUIRE: Portside! Nine o'clock!

831
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,450
Rick? Should I quit drinking?

832
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,950
O VER RADIO... Jonathan to Rick.

833
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,030
You'd better get a move on if you're gonna beat him to the tomb!

834
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,380
Yeah, yeah,

835
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:07,820
just get back here as fast as you can with the reinforcements.

836
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,070
No sightseeing!

837
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,950
Here, Dad.

838
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,090
- Is that for me? - Yeah.

839
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:16,740
Nice.

840
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,140
The Terracotta Army is not indestructible until it crosses the Great Wall.

841
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:24,590
That's comforting. How exactly are we supposed to fend them off?

842
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,920
When the Emperor built the Wall,

843
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,390
he buried his enemies underneath it

844
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,890
and cursed their souls to hold it up for eternity.

845
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:34,900
Most of them were conquered soldiers. I will call them to battle once again.

846
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:40,890
Unlock an altar, raise an army. That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

847
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,000
Grab her.

848
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,420
Guard her with your life.

849
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,710
Alex?

850
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,580
- Where'd he go? - Where do you think?

851
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,990
AWAKE!

852
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:18,340
Today you awake to a world...

853
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,050
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

854
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:23,230
Open the gates of the past

855
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:26,260
and free the souls of the wrongfully damned.

856
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,840
I will restore order...

857
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,850
I will retake what is mine.

858
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,810
I will crush any idea of freedom.

859
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:38,030
In the name of the ancestors and the righteous,

860
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:41,500
I sacrifice my immortality and that of my daughter

861
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,490
so that you may rise this day!

862
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,700
I will slaughter without mercy.

863
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:48,540
I will conquer without compassion.

864
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,250
I will now lead you past the Great Wall.

865
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:55,330
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

866
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:01,450
Bring down the wrath of the oppressed on this Emperor and all who follow him!

867
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:03,890
I raised you for one purpose...

868
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,130
to enforce my will on the entire world!

869
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,260
Long live the Emperor!

870
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,810
I call upon the hundreds and the thousands

871
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:19,780
that you may rise up and seize this moment to take your victory,

872
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,060
to take your justice and to take your revenge!

873
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,630
Zi Yuan.

874
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,560
It's General Ming!

875
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,680
Follow General Ming!

876
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,100
Prepare for battle!

877
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:14,280
These are... They're good undead guys, right?

878
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:17,500
Oh, no, no, no!

879
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,880
Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan sent us!

880
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,210
- Darling, I don't think he speaks English. - RICK: We're with Zi Yuan!

881
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:25,990
Zi Yuan?

882
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,790
Right.

883
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:30,740
Let's go.

884
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,090
To battle!

885
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,780
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

886
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,200
Archers form up!

887
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,700
Incoming!

888
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,090
- Hey! That's my favourite blue shirt. - I've always hated that shirt.


890
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,990
Death to General Ming!

891
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,370
Charge!

892
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,710
Welcome to the 20th century!

893
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:20,020
We can't let them cross the wall!

894
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:48,150
You are no longer immortal.

895
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:31,900
Honey! Fall back to higher ground!

896
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,510
I really hate mummies!

897
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:43,330
It seems the feeling's mutual!

898
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,210
Shut up, clay boy! Fore!

899
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,000
Run!

900
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,520
- Catch! - Got it!

901
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:11,940
Next time I say, "We've been in tougher scrapes than this," I mean this!

902
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,520
Die, you mummy bastards! Die!

903
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,060
There is no call for bad language!

904
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:49,560
Jonathan certainly knows how to make an entrance!

905
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,970
Any regrets, darling?

906
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,050
None. Not ever.

907
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:33,990
- You okay? - Yeah, sure, no problem.

908
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,970
We had it completely under control.

909
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:42,530
This guy ever run out of tricks?

910
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,240
No!

911
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:56,960
Mother! No!

912
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,080
Mother!

913
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,310
Mother! Mother!

914
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:20,610
Pierce through his heart.

915
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:27,950
You must live and fight on.

916
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:49,520
She said through the heart.

917
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,550
Through the heart. Let's go.

918
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:07,530
Get in!

919
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,110
The O'Connells are going to stop the Emperor!

920
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,760
So, Dad, what's the plan?

921
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,350
Divide and conquer!

922
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:29,920
No offence, but isn't that a little short on detail?

923
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:33,130
- Twelve o'clock low! - Hang on!

924
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,400
Remember our deal!

925
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,120
When this is over, my men get to drink for free!

926
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,120
You can have the whole damn bar for all I care!

927
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:51,320
I'm getting the hell out of China.

928
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:25,600
I dug you up...

929
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,980
and I'm gonna put you down.

930
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:03,050
Alex? Alex!

931
01:37:02,540 --> 01:37:03,700
Let go!

932
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,280
Never!

933
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:12,170
RICK: Enough tricks! Where's your honour?

934
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,010
Fight like a man!

935
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,410
Divide

936
01:37:58,510 --> 01:38:00,460
and conquer.

937
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,970
Now you can rule in hell.

938
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:17,880
The Emperor is dead.

939
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,040
The Emperor is dead!

940
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:11,080
- Evening, girls. You're looking well. - WO Good evening, Mr Maguire.

941
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:15,750
- It's a fine night to be me. - You dance great for an old lady.

942
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,430
Someone told me to stop living on the sidelines.

943
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:21,970
- Well, he sounds like a smart guy. - He is.

944
01:40:33,490 --> 01:40:37,080
So I guess Dash and Scarlet have their next adventure?

945
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,450
Why write about it when you can live it?

946
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:45,790
There's something incredibly romantic about vanquishing the undead.

947
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:49,200
Even more romantic doing it with you.

948
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:52,830
- Kiss me. - Don't have to ask me twice.

949
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,230
- Can I get your bag, sir? - No, no, no.

950
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,310
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

951
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:06,440
Where are you off to, Mr Carnahan?

952
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,900
Someplace where they don't have mummies.

953
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:11,820
- Step on it! I've got a plane to catch. - DRIVER: Yes, sir.

954
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:15,580
Yeah. Ciao, ciao, Shanghai.

955
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,230
Peru, here I come.

956
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:25,710
Soon after, mummies were found in Peru.
