1
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,058
B mark.

2
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,438
-Frame.
-Action.

3
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,005
Why do you think
this happened to you?

4
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,512
You mean why do bad things
happen to good people?

5
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,319
That's the real question, right?

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,351
Why us?

7
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:20,715
l mean, that's really
what everybody wants to know.

8
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,995
l moved into the house because
it's what we needed at that time.

9
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:29,861
We didn't ask for this
and we didn't deserve it.

10
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:33,395
The fact is, l don't know
why this happened to us.

11
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,335
We were just a regular family
like anybody else.

12
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,540
<i>The doctors didn't believe that...</i>

13
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:49,183
<i>...he would survive,
and anyone who's had a sick child...</i>

14
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:52,915
<i>...would understand the feeling
that you're losing your grasp on them...</i>

15
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:58,257
<i>...and something's pulling them
from the other side...</i>

16
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:02,160
<i>...which is really what was happening
in that house.</i>

17
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,168
Please, God, don't make him suffer.

18
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,504
Please make it work, or l'll never--

19
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,339
You know, l hear that talking to yourself
is the first sign of losing it.

20
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:19,252
l was not talking to myself.
l was talking to God.

21
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:24,117
Well, threatening the creator
of the universe is, like, step two.

22
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,021
That can't be good.

23
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,627
l was not threatening him.

24
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,391
l was simply letting him know
how precious you are to me.

25
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,436
You gotta pull over, Mom.
l'm gonna be sick.

26
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,036
Very funny.

27
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,072
No, l'm serious.
l'm really gonna be sick.

28
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:44,670
lt's whatever. Just don't look,
Mom, okay? l'm all right.

29
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,585
Come and get me, wiener head.

30
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,849
Hey, Mom.

31
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,720
-Who you calling a wiener head?
-No.

32
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,487
-Morning.
-Morning.

33
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,164
Didn't hear you come in.
What time did you get home?

34
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,062
Around 4.

35
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,070
Jesus. l know it's a long way,
but how did it take you eight hours?

36
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,802
You really wanna know how many times
we stopped so he could vomit?

37
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,374
God.

38
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,015
How is he now?

39
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,253
He's all right.
l think he's still sleeping.

40
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,945
-Let me get breakfast. You go to bed.
-lt's okay.

41
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:29,319
Wendy's helping
and l'm kind of wired from driving.

42
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,790
-Good morning, Aunt Sara.
-Morning, honey.

43
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,590
-Sorry about the chaos.
-lt's better than my house.

44
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,064
-Take this in to the hungry hordes.
-Yes.

45
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,597
Okay, guys. Here you go.

46
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,363
This is not good. One of these nights...

47
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,701
...you'll drive off the road,
you'll be so tired.

48
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,401
-l wish we could just move there.
-And in the meantime?

49
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:48,910
Pay mortgage and a rent?

50
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,083
And now we've taken in Wendy
and Mary and--

51
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,717
One a built-in babysitter,
the other a little angel.

52
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,318
l know, but...

53
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,786
...every penny we have is sunken in
the business. We didn't plan on--

54
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,188
Nobody plans on having a child
with cancer.

55
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:05,058
You know that's not what l meant.

56
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,996
l know.

57
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,342
Look, you're right. Let's just do it.

58
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:29,184
<i>Let's get a rental house in Connecticut
near the hospital.</i>

59
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:33,249
<i>But what are you gonna do?
And how are we gonna afford it?</i>

60
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,588
<i>I can come up on the weekends...</i>

61
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,321
<i>...get a second mortgage
on our second mortgage.</i>

62
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:41,001
<i>We're gonna make it through this,
right?</i>

63
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,797
<i>Definitely.</i>

64
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,671
See you.

65
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,945
His skin may well get burned and red.

66
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,773
lt'll blister like a bad sunburn.

67
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:55,675
<i>He threw up twice today.</i>

68
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,884
<i>Well, that's his cells dying
and being reborn.</i>

69
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,317
<i>Basically, we're waging war
inside Matt's body...</i>

70
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,787
<i>...and the battle's just begun.</i>

71
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,392
<i>That's what I'm afraid of.</i>

72
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:08,893
<i>But he qualified for the study, Sara.
That's good.</i>

73
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:11,123
<i>You did the right thing
by bringing him here.</i>

74
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,699
<i>I know.</i>

75
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,721
l don't wanna waste your time,
but how much you asking?

76
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:46,369
l'll give you the first month free if l don't
have to finish hammering in this sign.

77
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,910
Just needs some love and care and
a good family to bring it back to life.

78
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:59,049
-So you don't mind children?
-Where would we be without them?

79
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,417
lt's perfect.

80
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,382
l mean, it's everything we need.

81
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:08,992
lt's spacious and affordable and l'm
just wondering, where's the catch?

82
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,752
Well....

83
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,396
lt does have a bit of a history.

84
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,864
l saw one
that was almost perfect, but....

85
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,971
lt just....

86
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,200
lt just wasn't right.

87
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,692
They said you'd have body aches,
but no nausea.

88
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:49,565
Doctor says to patient,
''l've got bad news.

89
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:54,738
You've got cancer
and you've got Alzheimer's.''

90
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:57,303
Patient says:

91
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,740
''Oh, man. At least l don't have cancer.''

92
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,078
At least you won't lose your hair again.

93
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:10,181
Well, that's something.

94
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,476
-l brought a mattress.
-l can't thank you enough.

95
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,770
Oh, really, don't worry.

96
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,913
-Here's the keys.
-Thanks. ls the heat on?

97
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,811
-Oh, it's really warm in there.
-Okay.

98
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:38,510
All right. Now you get in and settle.
l'll take this.

99
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,655
l don't know. You know, he was so sick.

100
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:46,318
And l like this place. lt's what we need.

101
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,226
Well, l made an executive decision.
You weren't here.

102
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:54,470
And he was in so much pain. l just
couldn't put him through another mile.

103
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,872
Oh, great.

104
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,705
Hey.

105
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:37,273
You okay?

106
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,245
Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

107
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,139
Okay.

108
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,253
Pick of the house, okay?
Any bedroom you want.

109
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,226
Drink this.

110
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,799
They're not that bad.

111
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,169
-All right. Cheers.
-Keep telling yourself that.

112
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,971
Great. Have you ever had one?

113
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,974
Yeah.

114
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,699
Matt?

115
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,809
Matt, did you find a bedroom?

116
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,242
Yeah, l did.

117
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,361
Or it kind of picked me.

118
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:40,031
-What do you mean, it picked you?
-l don't know. lt's the meds.

119
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,098
l don't know what l'm talking about.

120
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:45,101
Well, which bedroom?

121
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,732
Down here?

122
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:50,705
-No.
-Why? Come on.

123
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:54,711
Look, it's nice and it's cool, and best,
it's got its own private bathroom.

124
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,940
Nobody has to hear me.

125
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:58,618
You don't have to hide from us.

126
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,514
The fact that everybody can
hear me puking...

127
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:02,450
...it just makes me feel worse, okay?

128
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:21,770
-What do you think's back there?
-l don't know.

129
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,941
-Hello. Anybody home?
-You okay?

130
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:26,172
Scared me.

131
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:28,941
-Hello?
-We're down here.

132
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,211
First one upstairs
gets first choice of rooms.

133
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,387
Mary.

134
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:36,183
Mary, wait until Aunt Sara and Uncle
Peter tell us where our rooms are.

135
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:37,620
-Mary.
-No.

136
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,318
-No, it's not fair. l want that room.
-Little monsters.

137
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,570
-No, watch it.
-l got it. l got it.

138
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,205
l'm not gonna croak from carrying
a lamp and an empty suitcase.

139
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,536
That's not what l meant.

140
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,407
l was worried about you
scratching the truck.

141
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,140
-Carry on.
-Okay.

142
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,982
Well, it's a little dark, but,
hey, l was a teenager once.

143
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:11,521
What's in here?

144
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,691
l don't know. l couldn't open it.

145
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,628
Well....

146
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,869
The doorknob turns, but....

147
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:31,781
Maybe they sealed it for storage.

148
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,812
Got a great room for Billy...

149
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,420
...and Mary.

150
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,955
And this...

151
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,719
...l thought was a perfect room for you.

152
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:44,361
And why do you say that?

153
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,031
Well, because it's got a beautiful view...

154
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,724
...and lots of space...

155
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:53,633
...and a huge closet.

156
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,939
-You like? Okay.
-Yeah.

157
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:09,055
Hey. l still don't know why
you wanna stay down here.

158
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,505
-Whoa, Mom.
-What?

159
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,585
Are you okay?

160
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,581
Yeah, just thanks for cleaning my room.

161
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:44,952
No problem.

162
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,262
-Why'd you put the plates back?
-What?

163
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,097
Well, l put the plates out,
and now they're back.

164
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,998
l didn't touch them, sweetie.

165
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,238
Are you all right?

166
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,109
Oh, that's--
Know what, that was my fault.

167
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,810
-They're too heavy.
-No, it's okay. l didn't drop them.

168
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,820
-Well, how did they--
-l don't know. l--

169
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,185
l just saw them up there
and l just-- l don't--

170
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,295
-You know, Dr. Brooks said--
-l know what Dr. Brooks said, okay?

171
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,296
He said that if l'm seeing things,
then he'll drop me from the trial.

172
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,832
-But if you--
-l'm not seeing things.

173
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:03,371
l'm just-- l'm tired. And l remember l put
the dishes too close to the edge, so....

174
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,977
You know, you tell me
if something like that happens.

175
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,438
-Promise?
-Yeah, l promise.

176
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,879
l'm so sorry l broke the dishes.

177
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,156
lt's okay, sweetie.

178
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,031
Come on, come on.

179
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,999
Got you. lt. You're so--

180
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,367
Oh, the burgers. The burgers.
Wait, wait, wait.

181
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:37,176
-Come and get me.
-All right.

182
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:51,581
Remember when we used to go
camping when you were young?

183
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,158
Every night you would...

184
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:58,198
...fall asleep counting the stars,
and you could never finish.

185
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,794
Used to drive you nuts.

186
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,233
You know, most of the stars
that we see are already dead.

187
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:11,940
They look pretty alive to me.

188
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:17,011
That's because they haven't gotten
the news yet.

189
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,493
Hey.

190
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,927
You all right?

191
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,905
Yeah. Everything's cool.

192
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,207
-You sure?
-Yeah.

193
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:44,505
All right.

194
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,877
Give me five.

195
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:51,077
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

196
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,184
l love you.

197
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:58,192
You know, it's sort of like a vacation.

198
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,329
Yeah, if Matt wasn't sick--

199
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:03,330
And you get your own room,
like a big girl.

200
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,765
Sure you're not gonna be scared
in here all alone?

201
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,495
l've got my toys.

202
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:09,038
Okay.

203
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:10,731
You go.

204
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:14,840
Now l lay me down to sleep,
l pray the Lord my soul to keep.

205
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:20,349
lf l shall die before l wake,
l pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen.

206
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:13,205
To bind the spirits.

207
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,928
Noncontact dermatitis.

208
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:45,865
A trauma in one place manifests
on another part of the body.

209
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:47,597
lt's not uncommon.

210
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:52,005
No fever. Excellent. Less nausea.
Good. Even a bit of an appetite.

211
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,874
Outstanding. And no visual
or auditory hallucinations...

212
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:57,050
...or other behavioral abnormalities?

213
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:01,114
Anything?

214
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,114
No.

215
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,519
Then we can continue to stage two.

216
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:10,219
Careful.

217
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:13,966
Watch your step.

218
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:17,194
Okay, you're almost there.

219
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,108
-Thank you.
-Okay.

220
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,541
l forgot my purse.
l'll be right back. Wait here.

221
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:27,077
-Okay.
-All right?

222
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,458
Mom?

223
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,930
The blue one that he takes for nausea?
Twenty-five bucks a pill.

224
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,332
l know. l tried.
But, Peter, l was on hold for an hour.

225
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:52,365
Matt?

226
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:54,296
Matt.

227
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,335
Where are you?

228
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,442
l'm in here.

229
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:17,823
How'd you get in here?

230
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:22,391
What is this place?

231
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,812
Hop on.

232
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:47,191
Take you for a ride.

233
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,501
Slow down.

234
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:07,980
Matt. Matt.

235
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:14,050
Stop.

236
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,383
Let me off!

237
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,453
Stop.

238
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,924
Matt. Matt.

239
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,731
-What's going on down here?
-What's the matter with you?

240
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,407
l guess l must've loosened it.

241
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,501
Good Lord.

242
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:14,042
Now we know
why the rent was so cheap.

243
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:23,023
What did you know, and when the hell
did you know it? Jesus.

244
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:24,787
Know what?

245
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,225
What this place was.

246
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:29,797
Aren't you the one
who says we can't live on lies?

247
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:32,471
Well, that's before,
when you were a drunk and a liar.

248
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:35,671
Right, but l'm not now.

249
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:40,206
l know.

250
00:28:41,248 --> 00:28:42,738
l'm sorry, Peter.

251
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,011
And you're right, l should've told you.
lt just....

252
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:53,082
We needed a place,
and it just seemed perfect.

253
00:28:57,899 --> 00:29:03,030
Okay, so we all know now
that this was a funeral home.

254
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,035
Big deal.

255
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:09,136
lt's not now and it hasn't been
for years and years.

256
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:11,711
lt's just a house.

257
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:15,540
Bricks and nails and wood.

258
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,055
lt's our house until Matt finishes
at the hospital.

259
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:23,225
And we're all under a lot of stress...

260
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,860
...so we need to pull together
like a team, okay?

261
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:32,832
Okay. So who wants to say grace?

262
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,161
Matt?

263
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,904
<i>Matt?</i>

264
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:08,528
<i>-Matt.
-Jonah. Jonah.</i>

265
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,836
<i>Honey?</i>

266
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,803
Are you all right?

267
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,143
Matt?

268
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,983
-What's wrong?
-lt's the medicine.

269
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,463
Didn't you see it?

270
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:10,163
Come on.

271
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,636
<i>So, what happened?</i>

272
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:27,111
Do you remember that book we
used to read when we were little kids?

273
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:28,813
The one with all...

274
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,219
...the weird pictures?

275
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:32,290
<i>The Man Who Wasn't There.</i>

276
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:34,257
Used to love that book.

277
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:35,862
Yeah, l remember.

278
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:41,697
<i>As I was walking up the stair
I saw a man who wasn't there</i>

279
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:44,064
<i>He wasn't there again today</i>

280
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:46,867
<i>-Oh, how I wish he'd go away
-Oh, how I wish he'd go away</i>

281
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:48,600
Yeah.

282
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,213
Do you remember the other one?

283
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,714
Maybe. Which one?

284
00:31:58,255 --> 00:32:00,519
<i>It was one bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

285
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,890
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

286
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,793
<i>Back-to-back they faced one another</i>

287
00:32:06,997 --> 00:32:09,693
<i>They drew their swords
And they shot each other</i>

288
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,961
<i>A deaf policeman, he heard the noise</i>

289
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,628
<i>And he came
And he killed those two dead boys</i>

290
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:18,707
Matt, you're scaring me.

291
00:32:23,948 --> 00:32:26,143
Well, join the club.

292
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:07,652
Oh, now, that didn't hurt.

293
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:12,888
You were dreaming.

294
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,465
Been breathing heavy,
and so, of course...

295
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:20,471
...it can either mean it was
a very bad dream or a very good one.

296
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:23,807
Well, l've had better.

297
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:34,180
l don't know, it's just, like,
that sometimes lately it's been tough.

298
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:35,949
What?

299
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:40,621
l don't know, like, do you ever,
like, see things?

300
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:43,797
Like, hear things that just--
They can't be there?

301
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:51,533
You don't ever wanna tell them
you can see things, okay?

302
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,005
They're not gonna understand.

303
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,609
l remember when my wife was dying...

304
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:04,014
...that whole last day
l sat there praying, crying.

305
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:07,684
And she never once looked up at me.

306
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:11,451
She just looked all around her.

307
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:14,755
At all the others in the room.

308
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:17,527
But we were alone.

309
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:20,903
Or so l thought.

310
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:25,842
See, she was where we are.

311
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,910
ln the valley...

312
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,774
...of the shadow of death.

313
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:41,286
Hey, you know what to do
when you find yourself in the valley?

314
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,227
No.

315
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,587
Fear no evil.

316
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,963
lf you wanna talk or....

317
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,832
Just call. Any time.

318
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,035
Are you sure
you have to go home tonight?

319
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:03,976
lf l'm not there at the site
first thing in the morning...

320
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:07,744
...they will hire another contractor
and then, you know....

321
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,352
l'm proud of you.

322
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:13,820
What, me?

323
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,619
-Yeah.
-For what?

324
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,128
For working so hard.

325
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:23,026
And for keeping your promises.

326
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:25,264
All of them.

327
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:34,212
You're naughty.
You can't play with that.

328
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,110
lt's mine.

329
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:39,615
You know, you're a bad doll.
You said you would make Matt better.

330
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:44,153
You said you would, but you lied.
''No, l didn't.''

331
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:46,257
Oh, yes, you did. You said you would.

332
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,451
You're gonna have to have
a timeout and...

333
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:50,789
l'm gonna put you in the timeout corner.

334
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,525
''That's really mean.''

335
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:02,204
Turn the lights on, please.

336
00:36:04,313 --> 00:36:05,301
Thank you.

337
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,894
Matt?

338
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:35,903
Come on, honey. Come on.

339
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:09,112
Hey, hey, hey, watch it.
Watch the milk.

340
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,714
Billy, l'm serious.

341
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:14,044
-ls Mary a total goon?
-No.

342
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:15,742
''Oh, yeah.''

343
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:19,251
ls Billy a poop head?

344
00:37:19,457 --> 00:37:20,754
''But of course, my dear.''

345
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,859
Language, language.
Here. Eat, eat, eat.

346
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:26,125
Come on. Stop.
l gotta go to work, okay?

347
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:28,191
Wendy is in charge.

348
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,467
Okay?

349
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:31,967
l'm sorry, honey.

350
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:35,265
See you, Mom.

351
00:37:36,242 --> 00:37:39,541
You be good or else you guys
have to deal with me.

352
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,514
Okay?

353
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:44,909
l'm just kidding. lt's okay.

354
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:48,045
Fifty-one, 52...

355
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:53,318
...53, 54, 55...

356
00:37:53,527 --> 00:38:00,058
...56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

357
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:03,402
Here l come.

358
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:37,763
Jonah.

359
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,840
Jonah!

360
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,388
Jonah!

361
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,285
Where are you, son?

362
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:00,519
Come here.

363
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,298
-Don't.
-You're not leaving.

364
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,626
l'm sorry.

365
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,432
Wendy?

366
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:11,295
Wendy! Help! Wendy!

367
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,998
Oh, for God's sakes.

368
00:40:29,903 --> 00:40:31,028
Just leave me alone.

369
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:36,639
lt's okay, it's okay.

370
00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:38,674
Come on, guys. Let's go.

371
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:41,780
Billy. Come on.

372
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:55,223
<i>It's okay, son. It's okay.</i>

373
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,833
<i>-l just-- l don't know who else to talk to.
-No, no, no. I'm glad you called.</i>

374
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:03,595
lt's all around us, all the time.

375
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:06,537
The living and the dead.

376
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:09,142
lnvisible to everyone.

377
00:41:09,578 --> 00:41:11,477
Almost everyone.

378
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:12,669
Yeah.

379
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,906
Because we're not like
other people anymore.

380
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:18,279
You see, most people spend
their life firmly planted in this world...

381
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:22,787
...then one day, they go straight
to the other side, but we....

382
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:25,256
We take a much more roundabout path.

383
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:29,329
We spend quite a lot of time
in the borderland.

384
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:34,199
But either way, only one thing matters.

385
00:41:35,071 --> 00:41:36,971
Yeah, what's that?

386
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:42,343
Well, find out what he wants from you.

387
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:24,479
Okay.

388
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,099
What do you want from me?

389
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:08,290
You know,
that was actually my favorite movie.

390
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:13,097
-Mom?
-Aunt Sara?

391
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:16,504
Mom.

392
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,639
You should've told me about this.
These symptoms can be a sign...

393
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,707
...that it's moved to the brain.
But Matt's MRls are all clear.

394
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,241
He has no tumors.

395
00:43:49,445 --> 00:43:52,414
Whatever was causing the behaviors,
it wasn't that.

396
00:43:52,848 --> 00:43:55,874
l'm just afraid he's gonna lose
his mind before he can get better.

397
00:43:56,085 --> 00:44:00,420
This is a crucial time, but he is still an
excellent candidate for this treatment.

398
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:02,989
Age counts enormously, and attitude.

399
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:04,820
Attitude?

400
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:07,223
His own family is afraid of him.

401
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:15,706
Where's your truck?

402
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,499
l sold it.

403
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,234
Why didn't you tell me?

404
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:24,710
l just did.

405
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:28,852
Paid the last round of bills,
this month's mortgage. Today.

406
00:44:29,053 --> 00:44:31,681
Like doc says, attitude.

407
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:48,905
Oh, honey.

408
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:53,777
l'm so sorry.
l just love you so much.

409
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:55,813
Mom, love hurts.

410
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:01,683
Mom, just--

411
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,815
Look, l want you to know that if--

412
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:07,856
lf what?

413
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:10,321
-That if l die--
-You won't.

414
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:18,936
--it's not your fault.

415
00:45:57,346 --> 00:45:58,869
No.

416
00:45:59,781 --> 00:46:04,048
No. You can't have him.

417
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:11,121
Can't have my son.

418
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,069
Hey.

419
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:29,966
We're bored.

420
00:47:30,176 --> 00:47:31,768
Please play with us.

421
00:47:31,978 --> 00:47:34,139
Why don't you ask Matt?

422
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,943
Yeah, why don't you ask Matt?

423
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:44,186
You okay?

424
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,115
l'm outstanding.

425
00:47:48,195 --> 00:47:49,992
Okay, come on, guys.
l'll count to 30...

426
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:53,428
...and let's see if we can find some
new hiding places this time.

427
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:57,435
Matt.

428
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:05,937
Go on.

429
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:21,427
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:48,818
There's room for me too.

431
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,219
Find your own spot.

432
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,689
Twenty-nine, 30.

433
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,797
Ready or not, here l come.

434
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:23,653
Let me out of here!

435
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:24,882
Help!

436
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:27,892
Get me out of here!

437
00:50:29,298 --> 00:50:30,265
Get me out!

438
00:50:33,035 --> 00:50:34,593
Get me out of here!

439
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:39,033
What happened? What? Come here.

440
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:41,607
What? What is it? What?

441
00:50:45,281 --> 00:50:46,269
Okay.

442
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:50,413
-Mary?
-l'm over here.

443
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,918
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

444
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:56,250
Wait. Be careful.
Hey, the floor must be rotten.

445
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:58,290
-Rotten? Where?
-Well, here for sure...

446
00:50:58,494 --> 00:50:59,984
...where Mary's leg fell through.

447
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:01,857
Just stand back, okay?

448
00:51:02,065 --> 00:51:03,498
Hey.

449
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,033
-You're okay.
-Bugs.

450
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:09,033
Okay. Come here. You okay? Yeah?

451
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,574
What is that?

452
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:27,688
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my.

453
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,738
What is it?

454
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,606
Okay. Come on.

455
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:50,804
Playtime's over.

456
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,717
God, they're all...

457
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,586
...dead.

458
00:51:56,956 --> 00:52:00,221
So sad. lt's probably the only time
they ever had their photo taken.

459
00:52:14,107 --> 00:52:16,075
What are those?

460
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,505
l don't know.

461
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:25,985
You all right?

462
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:27,779
Yeah.

463
00:52:29,724 --> 00:52:32,352
These are really weird.
lt has to be fake.

464
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:35,756
Let me see those.

465
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,868
What?

466
00:52:50,012 --> 00:52:52,105
-Nothing.
-Matt, come on.

467
00:52:52,313 --> 00:52:53,872
Just give me a chance.

468
00:53:00,923 --> 00:53:03,551
-l've seen him.
-Shut up.

469
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,590
Gave you a chance.

470
00:53:05,928 --> 00:53:08,193
l'm sorry, okay? Just....

471
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:09,920
Go on.

472
00:53:10,967 --> 00:53:12,662
Please?

473
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:17,704
l thought that l was hallucinating,
but l have seen this kid...

474
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:20,637
...almost every day
since we've been here.

475
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:24,508
Okay, l wake up in the middle
of the night...

476
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:26,978
...and it feels like he's been inside me...

477
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:29,846
...looking out through my eyes.

478
00:53:30,688 --> 00:53:33,179
<i>One bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

479
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:36,655
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

480
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:39,155
Okay, me and him,
we're just two dead boys.

481
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,370
Maybe the place is haunted.

482
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,869
Either way,
l mean, we need to find out...

483
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:57,036
...who put these things
under the floorboards and why.

484
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:59,148
Yeah, but how?

485
00:53:59,684 --> 00:54:03,143
Okay, well, don't tell anyone,
but there are these buildings...

486
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:08,486
...all over the country where
secret knowledge is kept, known only...

487
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:11,491
...as libraries.

488
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:28,378
<i>Okay, so check it out:
''A Case of Materialization. ''</i>

489
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:31,949
That is Ramsey Aickman,
and this was his mortuary.

490
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:37,181
Now, he had a very interesting hobby:
psychical research.

491
00:54:37,391 --> 00:54:40,451
<i>And your guy, dead kid,
his name was Jonah...</i>

492
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:43,355
<i>...and he was Aickman's assistant
and a medium.</i>

493
00:54:44,097 --> 00:54:46,463
<i>Supposedly, they contacted
the dead through Jonah...</i>

494
00:54:46,668 --> 00:54:49,636
<i>...and people came to have chats
with their dead hubby or wife...</i>

495
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:52,327
...or find out where Auntie Mame
hid the family jewels.

496
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,909
Now, he claims that he discovered
how to amplify the seances.

497
00:54:57,111 --> 00:55:00,911
So he not only contacted the dead,
but he made things appear.

498
00:55:01,115 --> 00:55:02,707
What things?

499
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,817
Ectoplasm.

500
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:07,010
And what is ectoplasm?

501
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:12,057
<i>A mysterious protoplasmic substance
streaming out of the body of mediums.</i>

502
00:55:12,595 --> 00:55:15,621
<i>So it's just like in those pictures
in the box.</i>

503
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:19,631
<i>Photographs of ectoplasm often
show a gelatinous material oozing...</i>

504
00:55:19,835 --> 00:55:21,928
<i>...from all the natural orifices
of the medium.</i>

505
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:27,097
<i>From mouth, ears, nose, eyes
and even the lower orifices.</i>

506
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:32,043
So Aickman held all those seances
in this house...

507
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:34,613
<i>...and people came
from all over and were convinced.</i>

508
00:55:34,818 --> 00:55:37,719
<i>Harvard professors,
all kinds of big shots.</i>

509
00:55:38,288 --> 00:55:41,724
<i>I mean, Aickman and Jonah's
seances were famous.</i>

510
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:44,389
Well, do we know
what happened to him?

511
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,289
Well, here's where it gets
a little weirder.

512
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:48,432
So there was a seance
led by Aickman...

513
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:50,122
<i>...with Jonah as the medium.</i>

514
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,768
All four sitters and Aickman
were found dead.

515
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,805
-Cause of death not clear.
-So Jonah killed them.

516
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:58,635
Nobody knows. No sign of him.

517
00:55:58,843 --> 00:56:01,606
He was missing, vanished,
never seen again.

518
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:03,413
Well, until now.

519
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:07,651
Well, here's the weirdest part of all.
Okay, so 30 years later...

520
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:09,683
<i>...when they expanded the highway...</i>

521
00:56:09,887 --> 00:56:11,445
<i>...they did the detour through
the cemetery--</i>

522
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:13,716
<i>Wait, we've been on that road
a million times.</i>

523
00:56:13,925 --> 00:56:17,189
<i>This is the thing: When they tried
to relocate some of the old plots...</i>

524
00:56:17,395 --> 00:56:19,728
...they found something weird,
or didn't find.

525
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:21,831
-What?
-Over a hundred bodies...

526
00:56:22,034 --> 00:56:24,867
...that were supposed to be there
weren't, just empty...

527
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,503
...coffins filled with sandbags.

528
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:29,700
Someone stole the bodies.

529
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:31,842
Aickman.

530
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:34,036
Or Jonah. Aickman or Jonah.

531
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:35,975
Maybe, but why?

532
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:44,122
l don't know,
but l might know somebody who does.

533
00:56:49,363 --> 00:56:51,796
-Remarkable.
-Do you think it's real?

534
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:57,134
Well, l've seen plenty of fakes,
but l've seen the real thing once.

535
00:56:58,071 --> 00:56:59,801
Paris. lt....

536
00:57:00,007 --> 00:57:04,842
lt was the most horrible thing
l've ever seen, but not this.

537
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:06,706
Must've been a very powerful medium.

538
00:57:44,987 --> 00:57:46,011
What are they?

539
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:47,553
Eyelids.

540
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:50,051
Human eyelids.

541
00:57:51,328 --> 00:57:52,419
Well, what are they for?

542
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:55,522
Necromancy.

543
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:57,255
Corpse-bothering.

544
00:57:58,702 --> 00:58:01,068
lt's a loathsome form of magic.

545
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:06,971
lt's seeking power through control
of the dead via relics of their bodies.

546
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:08,371
Well, why eyelids?

547
00:58:09,146 --> 00:58:10,944
That's a good question.

548
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:14,976
l mean, traditionally we'd close the eyes
of the dead so they may...

549
00:58:15,185 --> 00:58:16,744
...rest in darkness.

550
00:58:16,954 --> 00:58:21,948
Now, removing their eyelids keeps
their eyes open, makes them see.

551
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:26,694
Perhaps he intended them
to be watchmen...

552
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:30,396
...or guardians of this house...

553
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:32,401
...or of his secrets.

554
00:58:32,604 --> 00:58:35,037
By the way, l mean,
somewhere there are the bodies...

555
00:58:35,239 --> 00:58:39,108
...that belong to these people,
and he used them.

556
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:43,847
l think ultimately, Aickman intended
to enhance Jonah's powers.

557
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,945
Well, he amplified his seances.

558
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,349
Somehow he bound the spirits of the
dead to their bodies, yes...

559
00:58:50,556 --> 00:58:54,686
...as an amplifier, probably through
some form of ritual or desecration.

560
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,589
Perhaps buried outside the house?

561
00:59:03,469 --> 00:59:07,428
Perhaps it would help if we prayed
for all those poor souls that died here.

562
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:10,871
For the boy too.

563
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:29,054
<i>Mommy?</i>

564
00:59:29,263 --> 00:59:31,288
<i>-Come back.
-Mommy?</i>

565
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:34,760
<i>Please, please, help me.</i>

566
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:43,937
<i>-Mommy.
-Help me.</i>

567
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:47,508
Matt.

568
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,411
Matt.

569
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:53,145
Matt. Who are you?

570
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:54,784
What are you doing in my house?

571
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:56,352
-Matt?
-l'm a reverend.

572
01:00:56,555 --> 01:00:58,112
lt's okay. We asked him to come.

573
01:00:58,323 --> 01:00:59,790
-Asked him?
-We met at the--

574
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:01,892
-Get out of my house.
-Get off. lt's fine.

575
01:01:02,094 --> 01:01:04,254
We met at the hospital.
l receive treatment.

576
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:06,624
-Get out.
-Well, he called me for advice.

577
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:08,822
-lt's a little hard to explain.
-Try.

578
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:14,597
l believe that there is something evil
in this house...

579
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,332
...something no longer living
and not yet passed over.

580
01:01:17,544 --> 01:01:18,908
And it wants your son.

581
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:21,979
That's a dangerous situation
for someone who's close to death--

582
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:23,410
He's not.

583
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:29,477
And l'm as hopeful as you,
but tell me, have you not...

584
01:01:30,256 --> 01:01:32,690
...felt something strange here?

585
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,097
l don't know what you're talking about.

586
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:43,134
l appreciate the concern, but this is
not the type of help we need right now.

587
01:01:43,337 --> 01:01:45,270
l'd like you to leave.

588
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:47,297
Of course.

589
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:56,245
You're not alone.

590
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,741
Peter?

591
01:04:07,922 --> 01:04:09,354
Matt?

592
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:49,557
You're kidding.

593
01:04:51,066 --> 01:04:52,694
Hello!

594
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:54,563
Anybody home?

595
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:56,136
All the lights are on!

596
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,734
Why are all the lights on?

597
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,841
Ridiculous.

598
01:05:06,282 --> 01:05:07,841
Everybody in this house is sleeping...

599
01:05:08,085 --> 01:05:10,678
...with the lights on
and l wanna know why!

600
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:12,913
He's been drinking.

601
01:05:14,758 --> 01:05:17,420
Why don't we just build a fire
and throw money into it?

602
01:05:18,128 --> 01:05:19,095
lt's okay.

603
01:05:19,296 --> 01:05:21,925
l gotta pay a mortgage,
l'm now paying rent.

604
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:23,861
Here's another one.

605
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:26,164
God.

606
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,566
Every single room has got a light on!

607
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:46,086
Here. Here we go.

608
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:48,690
Sleep in the dark.

609
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,031
There we go.

610
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:04,266
Lights out.

611
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,812
There we go.

612
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:12,076
Yeah.

613
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,257
Peter...

614
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,752
...that was a cruel
and childish thing to do.

615
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,927
All you did was scare everybody
in this house.

616
01:06:29,036 --> 01:06:31,801
Don't. Don't. Don't.

617
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:40,104
Your family needs your strength,
not your self-pity.

618
01:06:42,383 --> 01:06:46,683
You get drunk again, don't come home.

619
01:07:51,155 --> 01:07:52,623
Matt?

620
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:06,437
Okay.

621
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,230
l'm so sorry.
l just didn't know who else to call.

622
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:25,862
lt's all right.

623
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:30,007
-Are you sure you're feeling up to this?
-Well, put it this way, l'm....

624
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:33,470
l'm exactly the right state of being...

625
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,237
...to traffic with ghosts.

626
01:08:40,786 --> 01:08:42,447
What is that?

627
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:45,079
Magnets. lron magnets.

628
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,622
lron defends from evil.

629
01:08:47,626 --> 01:08:51,494
So it's no accident
that prisons have iron bars...

630
01:08:51,697 --> 01:08:55,896
...to not merely contain the body,
but the evil that may lurk within it.

631
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,908
-What are you looking for?
-Where he died.

632
01:09:08,782 --> 01:09:12,718
Sometimes when death is violent
or filled with anger...

633
01:09:12,919 --> 01:09:18,755
...or fear or any strong emotion...

634
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:22,355
...it's as if the spirit doesn't pass on.

635
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,602
That's why we cover mirrors,
light candles, open the shades...

636
01:09:30,806 --> 01:09:33,296
...so that they may find their way out.

637
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:39,546
So a house with a trapped soul
is not so much haunted...

638
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:43,476
...as it is possessed.

639
01:09:50,893 --> 01:09:53,190
What's down there?

640
01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:57,961
Matt's bedroom.
lt's where they used to....

641
01:10:00,202 --> 01:10:02,433
Keep the children upstairs.

642
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:15,010
Yeah.

643
01:10:15,218 --> 01:10:16,277
He's here.

644
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:18,079
Do you see him, Matt?

645
01:10:20,456 --> 01:10:22,049
l don't see anything.

646
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:25,854
That's because you're strong, you're
healthy. You shouldn't see anything.

647
01:10:58,097 --> 01:11:00,531
So this is where you're trapped.

648
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:04,697
Don't worry.

649
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:08,540
Whatever you may have done,
we're not here to punish you...

650
01:11:10,609 --> 01:11:12,976
...only to free you.

651
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:15,412
Like a bird...

652
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:18,346
...caught in a room.

653
01:11:31,565 --> 01:11:33,796
There must be another way.

654
01:11:34,035 --> 01:11:35,763
Perhaps the other side of that wall.

655
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:43,966
l have to get his remains
out of the house.

656
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:05,590
Stop it!

657
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:40,861
lt stopped.

658
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:01,077
Will Matt be all right now?

659
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:02,449
Yeah.

660
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:04,420
The house is quiet and at peace.

661
01:14:05,059 --> 01:14:09,052
But l should warn you that sometimes
for a day or so after...

662
01:14:10,131 --> 01:14:15,034
...strange events, much like aftershocks
from an earthquake.

663
01:14:15,336 --> 01:14:18,033
But don't be alarmed...

664
01:14:18,507 --> 01:14:20,804
...it will pass,
within a day or two at the most.

665
01:14:31,787 --> 01:14:32,754
-Okay.
-All right.

666
01:14:35,224 --> 01:14:36,555
Thank you.

667
01:14:37,092 --> 01:14:38,822
lt's okay.

668
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:45,067
l wish l could say
it was my pleasure, but....

669
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:50,503
You gonna be okay to drive?

670
01:14:50,707 --> 01:14:53,141
We're all in God's hands.

671
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:26,944
<i>It's only five more sleeps
till parents' day.</i>

672
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:29,112
<i>I can't wait.
I got a lot to show you, Dad.</i>

673
01:15:29,313 --> 01:15:31,339
<i>You'll see
how I shoot the bow and arrow...</i>

674
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,782
<i>...and how far I can swim
and they're having a father-son race.</i>

675
01:15:35,987 --> 01:15:37,011
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

676
01:15:37,222 --> 01:15:40,317
<i>I bet you and me,
we beat all the others...</i>

677
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:43,790
<i>...unless you're too old
and broke down.</i>

678
01:15:43,995 --> 01:15:47,591
<i>Okay, well, I better go. Bye, Dad.</i>

679
01:15:50,603 --> 01:15:53,766
All right,
whatever was here is gone now.

680
01:15:53,973 --> 01:15:56,271
Now, we've all had
some really bad nights.

681
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:13,955
Stay here.

682
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:18,928
Oh, my God.

683
01:16:19,133 --> 01:16:21,295
Oh, my-- Oh, my--

684
01:16:22,504 --> 01:16:25,098
Oh, my God.
What have you done to yourself?

685
01:16:34,573 --> 01:16:38,100
All right, l'm gonna follow them. When
l get back, we're getting out of here.

686
01:18:33,564 --> 01:18:35,396
Sir?

687
01:18:36,434 --> 01:18:39,267
They'll be after you now.

688
01:18:39,471 --> 01:18:40,904
Get out.

689
01:19:19,112 --> 01:19:20,272
Somebody help me!

690
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:34,456
Please! Somebody help me!

691
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:36,019
Where's Matt?

692
01:20:36,224 --> 01:20:37,713
He's at the hospital.

693
01:20:37,925 --> 01:20:41,122
The doctors are gonna
take care of him, okay?

694
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,040
<i>Hi. We're not home right now,
so please leave a message.</i>

695
01:21:33,249 --> 01:21:34,477
<i>Thanks.</i>

696
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:38,655
l made a terrible mistake.

697
01:21:38,856 --> 01:21:42,189
Aickman didn't remove their eyelids
to make the dead see...

698
01:21:42,393 --> 01:21:44,327
...but to make them unseen.

699
01:21:44,528 --> 01:21:46,860
So all those missing bodies...

700
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:50,993
...all those poor souls in torment,
they're still there. They're in the house.

701
01:21:51,535 --> 01:21:55,096
<i>But the boy wasn't evil.</i>

702
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:57,103
<i>He was trying to free them.</i>

703
01:21:57,308 --> 01:21:58,606
<i>And I removed him.</i>

704
01:22:01,178 --> 01:22:03,340
<i>Now all that's left is their rage.</i>

705
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,281
You must get out now.

706
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:08,877
<i>Get out now.</i>

707
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:50,821
l'm sorry.

708
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:55,501
lt's okay. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

709
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:02,373
He's sedated and comfortable.

710
01:23:02,976 --> 01:23:04,376
We ran his panels.

711
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,347
l'm afraid it's not good news.

712
01:23:07,548 --> 01:23:09,243
His cell count is worse than before.

713
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,916
The treatment has, frankly,
had no effect.

714
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:17,619
How long do you think he has?

715
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:20,727
With these numbers,
l don't know what's keeping him alive.

716
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,829
He could go tonight.

717
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,728
There's really no way of saying for sure.

718
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:29,562
Then can we see him?

719
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:32,237
Of course.

720
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,169
To fight.

721
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:37,208
<i>One bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

722
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:39,439
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

723
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,911
He couldn't have gotten far.

724
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:43,642
<i>-One bright day in the middle--
-Hi, this is Dr. Brooks.</i>

725
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,616
Get me security right away, please.

726
01:23:45,822 --> 01:23:47,449
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

727
01:23:47,657 --> 01:23:49,022
<i>One bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

728
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:51,557
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

729
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:01,832
Matt?

730
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:05,568
Matt?

731
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,639
Matt.

732
01:24:22,594 --> 01:24:23,617
Come over. Come here.

733
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:27,862
We're gonna play
hide-and-seek now, okay?

734
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:29,693
Okay, go.

735
01:24:32,971 --> 01:24:35,463
-We have to get out of here. Come on.
-What's going on?

736
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:37,437
We have to go. We have to--

737
01:24:37,977 --> 01:24:39,534
Matt. Matt, no.

738
01:24:39,745 --> 01:24:40,940
Matt, no. No.

739
01:24:47,887 --> 01:24:49,548
-Get out.
-Matt.

740
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:51,451
Get out.

741
01:24:51,657 --> 01:24:54,455
Matt. No. Matt.

742
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,357
Get out. Whatever you do,
do not let them put out the fire.

743
01:24:57,564 --> 01:24:59,463
-What about you?
-l'm already dead.

744
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:04,367
-Matt, come out. Matt.
-Matt.

745
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:09,437
We'll find him.

746
01:29:24,844 --> 01:29:27,073
Mom. Dad.

747
01:29:28,047 --> 01:29:29,014
Where's Matt?

748
01:29:29,215 --> 01:29:31,410
-He's inside.
-l don't understand.

749
01:29:31,618 --> 01:29:34,246
-l thought you said it was over.
-Matt's trying to end it.

750
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:35,478
-l gotta get in.
-Ma'am.

751
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:38,681
No, you gotta let me in there.
l have to get my son.

752
01:29:38,892 --> 01:29:41,793
-Fire.
-Please let me go. Please.

753
01:29:41,995 --> 01:29:43,826
To unbind the spirits.

754
01:30:08,189 --> 01:30:10,055
What are we waiting for? Come on!

755
01:30:10,257 --> 01:30:11,987
Matt!

756
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,365
Oh, my God.

757
01:30:27,944 --> 01:30:29,911
Okay.

758
01:30:32,882 --> 01:30:34,542
All right.

759
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:39,043
l'm here. l'm here.

760
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,604
The Lord is my shepherd.

761
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:06,443
l shall not want.

762
01:31:06,683 --> 01:31:09,117
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

763
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,387
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

764
01:31:13,224 --> 01:31:15,521
He restoreth my soul.

765
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:17,957
He leadeth me
in the path of righteousness.

766
01:31:23,134 --> 01:31:25,398
He helped my son.

767
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:54,358
We're here. We're here. We're here.

768
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:10,277
Matt.

769
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:18,087
Be careful.

770
01:32:20,495 --> 01:32:22,019
Come on, wake up.

771
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,858
Wake up.

772
01:32:24,066 --> 01:32:26,260
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

773
01:32:37,746 --> 01:32:40,010
No. Hold on.

774
01:32:40,215 --> 01:32:42,012
Wake up.

775
01:32:54,363 --> 01:32:57,060
Come on, Matty.
Come on, Matty, breathe.

776
01:32:59,301 --> 01:33:01,361
l love you.

777
01:33:13,683 --> 01:33:15,777
<i>Wake up, Matt.</i>

<i>I just love you so much.</i>

<i>Come on, Matty, wake up.</i>

780
01:33:27,197 --> 01:33:29,928
Please, come on, honey.

781
01:33:31,436 --> 01:33:32,993
<i>Come on.</i>

782
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:41,204
You'll be all right.

783
01:33:58,731 --> 01:34:00,221
Hey.

784
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:13,135
He's okay.

785
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:35,628
<i>I don't really care
if anybody believes me or not.</i>

786
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:38,701
<i>I know what happened.</i>

787
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:43,900
<i>Doctors and nurses know
and my family knows.</i>

788
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:48,739
<i>And my son is alive...</i>

789
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,043
<i>...and well.</i>

790
01:34:53,022 --> 01:34:55,148
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

791
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:59,723
<i>They say that God works
in mysterious ways.</i>

792
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:04,495
<i>They just don't always tell you
how mysterious those ways can be.</i>

793
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:07,794
<i>Consider yourself warned.</i>
