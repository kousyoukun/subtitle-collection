1
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,058
B mark.

2
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,438
-Frame.
-Action.

3
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,005
Why do you think
this happened to you?

4
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,512
You mean why do bad things
happen to good people?

5
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,319
That's the real question, right?

6
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,351
Why us?

7
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:20,715
l mean, that's really
what everybody wants to know.

8
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,995
l moved into the house because
it's what we needed at that time.

9
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:29,861
We didn't ask for this
and we didn't deserve it.

10
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:33,395
The fact is, l don't know
why this happened to us.

11
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,335
We were just a regular family
like anybody else.

12
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,540
The doctors didn't believe that...

13
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:49,183
...he would survive,
and anyone who's had a sick 
child...

14
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:52,915
...would understand the feeling
that you're losing your grasp on
 them...

15
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:58,257
...and something's pulling them
from the other side...

16
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:02,160
...which is really what was 
happening
in that house.

17
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,168
Please, God, don't make him suffer.

18
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,504
Please make it work, or l'll never--

19
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:14,339
You know, l hear that talking 
to yourself
is the first sign of losing it.

20
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:19,252
l was not talking to myself.
l was talking to God.

21
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:24,117
Well, threatening the creator
of the universe is, like, step 
two.

22
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:26,021
That can't be good.

23
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,627
l was not threatening him.

24
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,391
l was simply letting him know
how precious you are to me.

25
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,436
You gotta pull over, Mom.
l'm gonna be sick.

26
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,036
Very funny.

27
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,072
No, l'm serious.
l'm really gonna be sick.

28
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:44,670
lt's whatever. Just don't look,
Mom, okay? l'm all right.

29
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,585
Come and get me, wiener head.

30
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,849
Hey, Mom.

31
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,720
-Who you calling a wiener head?
-No.

32
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:00,487
-Morning.
-Morning.

33
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,164
Didn't hear you come in.
What time did you get home?

34
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,062
Around 4.

35
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,070
Jesus. l know it's a long way,
but how did it take you eight 
hours?

36
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:14,802
You really wanna know how many 
times
we stopped so he could vomit?

37
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,374
God.

38
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,015
How is he now?

39
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:23,253
He's all right.
l think he's still sleeping.

40
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:25,945
-Let me get breakfast. You go
 to bed.
-lt's okay.

41
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:29,319
Wendy's helping
and l'm kind of wired from 
driving.

42
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,790
-Good morning, Aunt Sara.
-Morning, honey.

43
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,590
-Sorry about the chaos.
-lt's better than my house.

44
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,064
-Take this in to the hungry 
hordes.
-Yes.

45
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,597
Okay, guys. Here you go.

46
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,363
This is not good. One of these
 nights...

47
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,701
...you'll drive off the road,
you'll be so tired.

48
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,401
-l wish we could just move there.
-And in the meantime?

49
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:48,910
Pay mortgage and a rent?

50
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,083
And now we've taken in Wendy
and Mary and--

51
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,717
One a built-in babysitter,
the other a little angel.

52
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,318
l know, but...

53
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,786
...every penny we have is 
sunken in
the business. We didn't plan on--

54
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,188
Nobody plans on having a child
with cancer.

55
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:05,058
You know that's not what l meant.

56
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,996
l know.

57
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,342
Look, you're right. Let's just 
do it.

58
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:29,184
Let's get a rental house in 
Connecticut
near the hospital.

59
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:33,249
But what are you gonna do?
And how are we gonna afford it?

60
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,588
I can come up on the weekends...

61
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,321
...get a second mortgage
on our second mortgage.

62
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:41,001
We're gonna make it through this,
right?

63
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,797
Definitely.

64
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,671
See you.

65
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,945
His skin may well get burned 
and red.

66
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,773
lt'll blister like a bad sunburn.

67
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:55,675
He threw up twice today.

68
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,884
Well, that's his cells dying
and being reborn.

69
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,317
Basically, we're waging war
inside Matt's body...

70
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,787
...and the battle's just begun.

71
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,392
That's what I'm afraid of.

72
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:08,893
But he qualified for the study,
 Sara.
That's good.

73
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:11,123
You did the right thing
by bringing him here.

74
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,699
I know.

75
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,721
l don't wanna waste your time,
but how much you asking?

76
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:46,369
l'll give you the first month 
free if l don't
have to finish hammering in 
this sign.

77
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,910
Just needs some love and care and
a good family to bring it back
 to life.

78
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:59,049
-So you don't mind children?
-Where would we be without them?

79
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,417
lt's perfect.

80
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,382
l mean, it's everything we need.

81
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:08,992
lt's spacious and affordable 
and l'm
just wondering, where's the 
catch?

82
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,752
Well....

83
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,396
lt does have a bit of a history.

84
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,864
l saw one
that was almost perfect, but....

85
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,971
lt just....

86
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,200
lt just wasn't right.

87
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,692
They said you'd have body aches,
but no nausea.

88
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:49,565
Doctor says to patient,
''l've got bad news.

89
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:54,738
You've got cancer
and you've got Alzheimer's.''

90
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:57,303
Patient says:

91
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,740
''Oh, man. At least l don't
 have cancer.''

92
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,078
At least you won't lose your 
hair again.

93
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:10,181
Well, that's something.

94
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,476
-l brought a mattress.
-l can't thank you enough.

95
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,770
Oh, really, don't worry.

96
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,913
-Here's the keys.
-Thanks. ls the heat on?

97
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,811
-Oh, it's really warm in there.
-Okay.

98
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:38,510
All right. Now you get in and 
settle.
l'll take this.

99
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,655
l don't know. You know, he was
 so sick.

100
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:46,318
And l like this place. lt's what 
we need.

101
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,226
Well, l made an executive 
decision.
You weren't here.

102
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:54,470
And he was in so much pain. 
l just
couldn't put him through 
another mile.

103
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:34,872
Oh, great.

104
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,705
Hey.

105
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:37,273
You okay?

106
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,245
Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

107
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,139
Okay.

108
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,253
Pick of the house, okay?
Any bedroom you want.

109
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,226
Drink this.

110
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,799
They're not that bad.

111
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,169
-All right. Cheers.
-Keep telling yourself that.

112
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,971
Great. Have you ever had one?

113
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,974
Yeah.

114
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,699
Matt?

115
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,809
Matt, did you find a bedroom?

116
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,242
Yeah, l did.

117
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,361
Or it kind of picked me.

118
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:40,031
-What do you mean, it picked 
you?
-l don't know. lt's the meds.

119
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,098
l don't know what l'm talking 
about.

120
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:45,101
Well, which bedroom?

121
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,732
Down here?

122
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:50,705
-No.
-Why? Come on.

123
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:54,711
Look, it's nice and it's cool,
 and best,
it's got its own private bathroom.

124
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,940
Nobody has to hear me.

125
00:14:57,151 --> 00:14:58,618
You don't have to hide from us.

126
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,514
The fact that everybody can
hear me puking...

127
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:02,450
...it just makes me feel worse,
 okay?

128
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:21,770
-What do you think's back there?
-l don't know.

129
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,941
-Hello. Anybody home?
-You okay?

130
00:15:25,147 --> 00:15:26,172
Scared me.

131
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:28,941
-Hello?
-We're down here.

132
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,211
First one upstairs
gets first choice of rooms.

133
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,387
Mary.

134
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:36,183
Mary, wait until Aunt Sara and
 Uncle
Peter tell us where our rooms are.

135
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:37,620
-Mary.
-No.

136
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,318
-No, it's not fair. l want that
 room.
-Little monsters.

137
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,570
-No, watch it.
-l got it. l got it.

138
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,205
l'm not gonna croak from 
carrying
a lamp and an empty suitcase.

139
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,536
That's not what l meant.

140
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,407
l was worried about you
scratching the truck.

141
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,140
-Carry on.
-Okay.

142
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,982
Well, it's a little dark, but,
hey, l was a teenager once.

143
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:11,521
What's in here?

144
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,691
l don't know. l couldn't open it.

145
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,628
Well....

146
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,869
The doorknob turns, but....

147
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:31,781
Maybe they sealed it for storage.

148
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,812
Got a great room for Billy...

149
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,420
...and Mary.

150
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,955
And this...

151
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,719
...l thought was a perfect 
room for you.

152
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:44,361
And why do you say that?

153
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,031
Well, because it's got a 
beautiful view...

154
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,724
...and lots of space...

155
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:53,633
...and a huge closet.

156
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,939
-You like? Okay.
-Yeah.

157
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:09,055
Hey. l still don't know why
you wanna stay down here.

158
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,505
-Whoa, Mom.
-What?

159
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,585
Are you okay?

160
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,581
Yeah, just thanks for cleaning
 my room.

161
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:44,952
No problem.

162
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:21,262
-Why'd you put the plates back?
-What?

163
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,097
Well, l put the plates out,
and now they're back.

164
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,998
l didn't touch them, sweetie.

165
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,238
Are you all right?

166
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,109
Oh, that's--
Know what, that was my fault.

167
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,810
-They're too heavy.
-No, it's okay. l didn't drop them.

168
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,820
-Well, how did they--
-l don't know. l--

169
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,185
l just saw them up there
and l just-- l don't--

170
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,295
-You know, Dr. Brooks said--
-l know what Dr. Brooks said,
 okay?

171
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:55,296
He said that if l'm seeing things,
then he'll drop me from the trial.

172
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,832
-But if you--
-l'm not seeing things.

173
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:03,371
l'm just-- l'm tired. And l 
remember l put
the dishes too close to the edge,
 so....

174
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,977
You know, you tell me
if something like that happens.

175
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,438
-Promise?
-Yeah, l promise.

176
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,879
l'm so sorry l broke the dishes.

177
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,156
lt's okay, sweetie.

178
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,031
Come on, come on.

179
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,999
Got you. lt. You're so--

180
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,367
Oh, the burgers. The burgers.
Wait, wait, wait.

181
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:37,176
-Come and get me.
-All right.

182
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:51,581
Remember when we used to go
camping when you were young?

183
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,158
Every night you would...

184
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:58,198
...fall asleep counting the 
stars,
and you could never finish.

185
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,794
Used to drive you nuts.

186
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,233
You know, most of the stars
that we see are already dead.

187
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:11,940
They look pretty alive to me.

188
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:17,011
That's because they haven't 
gotten
the news yet.

189
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,493
Hey.

190
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,927
You all right?

191
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,905
Yeah. Everything's cool.

192
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,207
-You sure?
-Yeah.

193
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:44,505
All right.

194
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:46,877
Give me five.

195
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:51,077
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

196
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,184
l love you.

197
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:58,192
You know, it's sort of like a
 vacation.

198
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,329
Yeah, if Matt wasn't sick--

199
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:03,330
And you get your own room,
like a big girl.

200
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,765
Sure you're not gonna be scared
in here all alone?

201
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,495
l've got my toys.

202
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:09,038
Okay.

203
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:10,731
You go.

204
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:14,840
Now l lay me down to sleep,
l pray the Lord my soul to keep.

205
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:20,349
lf l shall die before l wake,
l pray the Lord my soul to take.
 Amen.

206
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:13,205
To bind the spirits.

207
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,151
Noncontact dermatitis.

208
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,088
A trauma in one place manifests
on another part of the body.

209
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,820
lt's not uncommon.

210
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,228
No fever. Excellent. Less nausea.
Good. Even a bit of an appetite.

211
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:45,097
Outstanding. And no visual
or auditory hallucinations...

212
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:47,273
...or other behavioral abnormalities?

213
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,337
Anything?

214
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,337
No.

215
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:56,742
Then we can continue to stage two.

216
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:00,442
Careful.

217
00:24:02,756 --> 00:24:04,189
Watch your step.

218
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:07,417
Okay, you're almost there.

219
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:12,331
-Thank you.
-Okay.

220
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,764
l forgot my purse.
l'll be right back. Wait here.

221
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,300
-Okay.
-All right?

222
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:28,681
Mom?

223
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:38,153
The blue one that he takes for
 nausea?
Twenty-five bucks a pill.

224
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,555
l know. l tried.
But, Peter, l was on hold for 
an hour.

225
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:42,588
Matt?

226
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,519
Matt.

227
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,558
Where are you?

228
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:48,665
l'm in here.

229
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:08,046
How'd you get in here?

230
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,614
What is this place?

231
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:31,035
Hop on.

232
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:37,414
Take you for a ride.

233
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,724
Slow down.

234
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:58,203
Matt. Matt.

235
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,273
Stop.

236
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,606
Let me off!

237
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,676
Stop.

238
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:12,147
Matt. Matt.

239
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:19,954
-What's going on down here?
-What's the matter with you?

240
00:27:20,163 --> 00:27:22,630
l guess l must've loosened it.

241
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,724
Good Lord.

242
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:04,265
Now we know
why the rent was so cheap.

243
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:13,246
What did you know, and when 
the hell
did you know it? Jesus.

244
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,010
Know what?

245
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,448
What this place was.

246
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,020
Aren't you the one
who says we can't live on lies?

247
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,694
Well, that's before,
when you were a drunk and a liar.

248
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,894
Right, but l'm not now.

249
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:30,429
l know.

250
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:32,961
l'm sorry, Peter.

251
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:37,234
And you're right, l should've 
told you.
lt just....

252
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:43,305
We needed a place,
and it just seemed perfect.

253
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:53,253
Okay, so we all know now
that this was a funeral home.

254
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:55,258
Big deal.

255
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:59,359
lt's not now and it hasn't been
for years and years.

256
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,934
lt's just a house.

257
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:05,763
Bricks and nails and wood.

258
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:11,278
lt's our house until Matt finishes
at the hospital.

259
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,448
And we're all under a lot of
 stress...

260
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:16,083
...so we need to pull together
like a team, okay?

261
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:23,055
Okay. So who wants to say grace?

262
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:25,384
Matt?

263
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:35,127
Matt?

264
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:58,751
-Matt.
-Jonah. Jonah.

265
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,059
Honey?

266
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,026
Are you all right?

267
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,366
Matt?

268
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,206
-What's wrong?
-lt's the medicine.

269
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:54,686
Didn't you see it?

270
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,386
Come on.

271
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:08,859
So, what happened?

272
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:17,334
Do you remember that book we
used to read when we were 
little kids?

273
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:19,036
The one with all...

274
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,442
...the weird pictures?

275
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,513
The Man Who Wasn't There.

276
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,480
Used to love that book.

277
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:26,085
Yeah, l remember.

278
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:31,920
As I was walking up the stair
I saw a man who wasn't there

279
00:31:32,127 --> 00:31:34,287
He wasn't there again today

280
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:37,090
-Oh, how I wish he'd go away
-Oh, how I wish he'd go away

281
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,823
Yeah.

282
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:43,436
Do you remember the other one?

283
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:45,937
Maybe. Which one?

284
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:50,742
It was one bright day
In the middle of the night

285
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:54,113
Two dead boys got up to fight

286
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:57,016
Back-to-back they faced one 
another

287
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,916
They drew their swords
And they shot each other

288
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:02,184
A deaf policeman, he heard the 
noise

289
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:05,851
And he came
And he killed those two dead boys

290
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:08,930
Matt, you're scaring me.

291
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:16,366
Well, join the club.

292
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,875
Oh, now, that didn't hurt.

293
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:03,111
You were dreaming.

294
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:05,688
Been breathing heavy,
and so, of course...

295
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:10,694
...it can either mean it was
a very bad dream or a very 
good one.

296
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,030
Well, l've had better.

297
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:24,403
l don't know, it's just, like,
that sometimes lately it's 
been tough.

298
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:26,172
What?

299
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:30,844
l don't know, like, do you ever,
like, see things?

300
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:34,020
Like, hear things that just--
They can't be there?

301
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:41,756
You don't ever wanna tell them
you can see things, okay?

302
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,228
They're not gonna understand.

303
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:49,832
l remember when my wife was 
dying...

304
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:54,237
...that whole last day
l sat there praying, crying.

305
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,907
And she never once looked up 
at me.

306
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:01,674
She just looked all around her.

307
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:04,978
At all the others in the room.

308
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:07,750
But we were alone.

309
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:11,126
Or so l thought.

310
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:16,065
See, she was where we are.

311
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:19,133
ln the valley...

312
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,997
...of the shadow of death.

313
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:31,509
Hey, you know what to do
when you find yourself in the 
valley?

314
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:33,450
No.

315
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:36,810
Fear no evil.

316
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:45,186
lf you wanna talk or....

317
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:49,055
Just call. Any time.

318
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,258
Are you sure
you have to go home tonight?

319
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,199
lf l'm not there at the site
first thing in the morning...

320
00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:57,967
...they will hire another 
contractor
and then, you know....

321
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:02,575
l'm proud of you.

322
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,043
What, me?

323
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:05,842
-Yeah.
-For what?

324
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,351
For working so hard.

325
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:13,249
And for keeping your promises.

326
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,487
All of them.

327
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:24,435
You're naughty.
You can't play with that.

328
00:35:24,637 --> 00:35:26,333
lt's mine.

329
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:29,838
You know, you're a bad doll.
You said you would make Matt 
better.

330
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:34,376
You said you would, but you lied.
''No, l didn't.''

331
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,480
Oh, yes, you did. You said you 
would.

332
00:35:36,682 --> 00:35:38,674
You're gonna have to have
a timeout and...

333
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,012
l'm gonna put you in the timeout 
corner.

334
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,748
''That's really mean.''

335
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,427
Turn the lights on, please.

336
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:55,524
Thank you.

337
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,117
Matt?

338
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:26,126
Come on, honey. Come on.

339
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:59,335
Hey, hey, hey, watch it.
Watch the milk.

340
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,937
Billy, l'm serious.

341
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,267
-ls Mary a total goon?
-No.

342
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:05,965
''Oh, yeah.''

343
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:09,474
ls Billy a poop head?

344
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,977
''But of course, my dear.''

345
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:13,082
Language, language.
Here. Eat, eat, eat.

346
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:16,348
Come on. Stop.
l gotta go to work, okay?

347
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:18,414
Wendy is in charge.

348
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:19,690
Okay?

349
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:22,190
l'm sorry, honey.

350
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,488
See you, Mom.

351
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:29,764
You be good or else you guys
have to deal with me.

352
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:31,737
Okay?

353
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:35,132
l'm just kidding. lt's okay.

354
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:38,268
51, 52...

355
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:43,541
...53, 54, 55...

356
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:50,281
...56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

357
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:53,625
Here l come.

358
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:27,986
Jonah.

359
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:34,063
Jonah!

360
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,611
Jonah!

361
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:46,508
Where are you, son?

362
00:38:49,252 --> 00:38:50,742
Come here.

363
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:52,521
-Don't.
-You're not leaving.

364
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,849
l'm sorry.

365
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:58,655
Wendy?

366
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:01,518
Wendy! Help! Wendy!

367
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:15,672
Oh, for God's sakes.

368
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:17,702
Just leave me alone.

369
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:23,313
lt's okay, it's okay.

370
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:25,348
Come on, guys. Let's go.

371
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:28,454
Billy. Come on.

372
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:41,897
It's okay, son. It's okay.

373
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:46,507
-l just-- l don't know who else
 to talk to.
-No, no, no. I'm glad you called.

374
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,269
lt's all around us, all the time.

375
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,211
The living and the dead.

376
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:55,816
lnvisible to everyone.

377
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,151
Almost everyone.

378
00:40:58,353 --> 00:40:59,343
Yeah.

379
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:01,580
Because we're not like
other people anymore.

380
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:04,953
You see, most people spend
their life firmly planted in 
this world...

381
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,461
...then one day, they go straight
to the other side, but we....

382
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,930
We take a much more roundabout
 path.

383
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:16,003
We spend quite a lot of time
in the borderland.

384
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,873
But either way, only one thing 
matters.

385
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,645
Yeah, what's that?

386
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,017
Well, find out what he wants 
from you.

387
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,153
Okay.

388
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:23,773
What do you want from me?

389
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:54,964
You know,
that was actually my favorite
 movie.

390
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,771
-Mom?
-Aunt Sara?

391
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,178
Mom.

392
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:31,313
You should've told me about this.
These symptoms can be a sign...

393
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:34,381
...that it's moved to the brain.
But Matt's MRls are all clear.

394
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:35,915
He has no tumors.

395
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,088
Whatever was causing the
 behaviors,
it wasn't that.

396
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:42,548
l'm just afraid he's gonna lose
his mind before he can get better.

397
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:47,094
This is a crucial time, but he 
is still an
excellent candidate for this 
treatment.

398
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:49,663
Age counts enormously, and
attitude.

399
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:51,494
Attitude?

400
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:53,897
His own family is afraid of him.

401
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:02,380
Where's your truck?

402
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:05,173
l sold it.

403
00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:07,908
Why didn't you tell me?

404
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,384
l just did.

405
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:15,526
Paid the last round of bills,
this month's mortgage. Today.

406
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:18,355
Like doc says, attitude.

407
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:35,579
Oh, honey.

408
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,451
l'm so sorry.
l just love you so much.

409
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,487
Mom, love hurts.

410
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,357
Mom, just--

411
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,489
Look, l want you to know that if--

412
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,530
lf what?

413
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:56,995
-That if l die--
-You won't.

414
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:05,610
--it's not your fault.

415
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,543
No.

416
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:50,722
No. You can't have him.

417
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:57,795
Can't have my son.

418
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,743
Hey.

419
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:16,640
We're bored.

420
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,442
Please play with us.

421
00:47:18,652 --> 00:47:20,813
Why don't you ask Matt?

422
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:25,617
Yeah, why don't you ask Matt?

423
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,860
You okay?

424
00:47:31,298 --> 00:47:32,789
l'm outstanding.

425
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,666
Okay, come on, guys.
l'll count to 30...

426
00:47:36,871 --> 00:47:40,102
...and let's see if we can 
find some
new hiding places this time.

427
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,109
Matt.

428
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:52,611
Go on.

429
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:08,101
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:35,492
There's room for me too.

431
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,893
Find your own spot.

432
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:40,363
Twenty-nine, 30.

433
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:42,471
Ready or not, here l come.

434
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:10,327
Let me out of here!

435
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:11,556
Help!

436
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:14,566
Get me out of here!

437
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:16,939
Get me out!

438
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,267
Get me out of here!

439
00:50:23,045 --> 00:50:25,707
What happened? What? Come here.

440
00:50:25,915 --> 00:50:28,281
What? What is it? What?

441
00:50:31,955 --> 00:50:32,943
Okay.

442
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,087
-Mary?
-l'm over here.

443
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:39,592
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

444
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:42,924
Wait. Be careful.
Hey, the floor must be rotten.

445
00:50:43,133 --> 00:50:44,964
-Rotten? Where?
-Well, here for sure...

446
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:46,658
...where Mary's leg fell through.

447
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:48,531
Just stand back, okay?

448
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:50,172
Hey.

449
00:50:50,374 --> 00:50:52,707
-You're okay.
-Bugs.

450
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,707
Okay. Come here. You okay? Yeah?

451
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:04,248
What is that?

452
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:14,362
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my.

453
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,412
What is it?

454
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:36,280
Okay. Come on.

455
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:37,478
Playtime's over.

456
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:40,391
God, they're all...

457
00:51:41,294 --> 00:51:42,260
...dead.

458
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:46,895
So sad. lt's probably the only 
time
they ever had their photo taken.

459
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:02,749
What are those?

460
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:05,179
l don't know.

461
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:12,659
You all right?

462
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,453
Yeah.

463
00:52:16,398 --> 00:52:19,026
These are really weird.
lt has to be fake.

464
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:22,430
Let me see those.

465
00:52:32,914 --> 00:52:34,542
What?

466
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,779
-Nothing.
-Matt, come on.

467
00:52:38,987 --> 00:52:40,546
Just give me a chance.

468
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,225
-l've seen him.
-Shut up.

469
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,264
Gave you a chance.

470
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,867
l'm sorry, okay? Just....

471
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:56,594
Go on.

472
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,336
Please?

473
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,378
l thought that l was hallucinating,
but l have seen this kid...

474
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,311
...almost every day
since we've been here.

475
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,182
Okay, l wake up in the middle
of the night...

476
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,652
...and it feels like he's been
 inside me...

477
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,520
...looking out through my eyes.

478
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:19,853
One bright day
In the middle of the night

479
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,329
Two dead boys got up to fight

480
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:25,829
Okay, me and him,
we're just two dead boys.

481
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,044
Maybe the place is haunted.

482
00:53:35,914 --> 00:53:39,543
Either way,
l mean, we need to find out...

483
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:43,710
...who put these things
under the floorboards and why.

484
00:53:43,923 --> 00:53:45,822
Yeah, but how?

485
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:49,817
Okay, well, don't tell anyone,
but there are these buildings...

486
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:55,160
...all over the country where
secret knowledge is kept, 
known only...

487
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,165
...as libraries.

488
00:54:11,651 --> 00:54:15,052
Okay, so check it out:
''A Case of Materialization. ''

489
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:18,623
That is Ramsey Aickman,
and this was his mortuary.

490
00:54:19,327 --> 00:54:23,855
Now, he had a very interesting 
hobby:
psychical research.

491
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:27,125
And your guy, dead kid,
his name was Jonah...

492
00:54:27,401 --> 00:54:30,029
...and he was Aickman's assistant
and a medium.

493
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,137
Supposedly, they contacted
the dead through Jonah...

494
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:36,310
...and people came to have chats
with their dead hubby or wife...

495
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,001
...or find out where Auntie Mame
hid the family jewels.

496
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:43,583
Now, he claims that he discovered
how to amplify the seances.

497
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:47,585
So he not only contacted the dead,
but he made things appear.

498
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:49,381
What things?

499
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:51,491
Ectoplasm.

500
00:54:51,693 --> 00:54:53,684
And what is ectoplasm?

501
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:58,731
A mysterious protoplasmic substance
streaming out of the body of 
mediums.

502
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:02,295
So it's just like in those 
pictures
in the box.

503
00:55:02,504 --> 00:55:06,305
Photographs of ectoplasm often
show a gelatinous material oozing...

504
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:08,602
...from all the natural orifices
of the medium.

505
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:13,771
From mouth, ears, nose, eyes
and even the lower orifices.

506
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:18,717
So Aickman held all those seances
in this house...

507
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:21,287
...and people came
from all over and were convinced.

508
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:24,393
Harvard professors,
all kinds of big shots.

509
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:28,398
I mean, Aickman and Jonah's
seances were famous.

510
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,063
Well, do we know
what happened to him?

511
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:32,963
Well, here's where it gets
a little weirder.

512
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,106
So there was a seance
led by Aickman...

513
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:36,796
...with Jonah as the medium.

514
00:55:37,007 --> 00:55:39,442
All four sitters and Aickman
were found dead.

515
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,479
-Cause of death not clear.
-So Jonah killed them.

516
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,309
Nobody knows. No sign of him.

517
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:48,280
He was missing, vanished,
never seen again.

518
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,087
Well, until now.

519
00:55:51,356 --> 00:55:54,325
Well, here's the weirdest part
 of all.
Okay, so 30 years later...

520
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:56,357
...when they expanded the highway...

521
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,119
...they did the detour through
the cemetery--

522
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:00,390
Wait, we've been on that road
a million times.

523
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,863
This is the thing: When they 
tried
to relocate some of the old plots...

524
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,402
...they found something weird,
or didn't find.

525
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:08,505
-What?
-Over a hundred bodies...

526
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:11,541
...that were supposed to be 
there
weren't, just empty...

527
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,177
...coffins filled with sandbags.

528
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,374
Someone stole the bodies.

529
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,516
Aickman.

530
00:56:18,718 --> 00:56:20,710
Or Jonah. Aickman or Jonah.

531
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:22,649
Maybe, but why?

532
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:30,796
l don't know,
but l might know somebody who 
does.

533
00:56:36,037 --> 00:56:38,470
-Remarkable.
-Do you think it's real?

534
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:43,808
Well, l've seen plenty of fakes,
but l've seen the real thing 
once.

535
00:56:44,745 --> 00:56:46,475
Paris. lt....

536
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:51,516
lt was the most horrible thing
l've ever seen, but not this.

537
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:53,380
Must've been a very powerful 
medium.

538
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:32,685
What are they?

539
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:34,227
Eyelids.

540
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:36,725
Human eyelids.

541
00:57:38,002 --> 00:57:39,093
Well, what are they for?

542
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,196
Necromancy.

543
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:43,929
Corpse-bothering.

544
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:47,742
lt's a loathsome form of magic.

545
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:53,645
lt's seeking power through 
control
of the dead via relics of their 
bodies.

546
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:55,045
Well, why eyelids?

547
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,618
That's a good question.

548
00:57:58,557 --> 00:58:01,650
l mean, traditionally we'd close 
the eyes
of the dead so they may...

549
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,418
...rest in darkness.

550
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:08,622
Now, removing their eyelids keeps
their eyes open, makes them see.

551
00:58:10,535 --> 00:58:13,368
Perhaps he intended them
to be watchmen...

552
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:17,070
...or guardians of this house...

553
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:19,075
...or of his secrets.

554
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,711
By the way, l mean,
somewhere there are the bodies...

555
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:25,782
...that belong to these people,
and he used them.

556
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:30,521
l think ultimately, Aickman 
intended
to enhance Jonah's powers.

557
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,619
Well, he amplified his seances.

558
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:37,023
Somehow he bound the spirits 
of the
dead to their bodies, yes...

559
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,360
...as an amplifier, probably 
through
some form of ritual or desecration.

560
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:45,263
Perhaps buried outside the house?

561
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:54,102
Perhaps it would help if we 
prayed
for all those poor souls that 
died here.

562
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,545
For the boy too.

563
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:15,728
Mommy?

564
00:59:15,937 --> 00:59:17,962
-Come back.
-Mommy?

565
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:21,434
Please, please, help me.

566
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,611
-Mommy.
-Help me.

567
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:34,182
Matt.

568
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:09,085
Matt.

569
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,819
Matt. Who are you?

570
01:00:40,025 --> 01:00:41,458
What are you doing in my house?

571
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,026
-Matt?
-l'm a reverend.

572
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:44,786
lt's okay. We asked him to come.

573
01:00:44,997 --> 01:00:46,464
-Asked him?
-We met at the--

574
01:00:46,665 --> 01:00:48,566
-Get out of my house.
-Get off. lt's fine.

575
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:50,928
We met at the hospital.
l receive treatment.

576
01:00:51,136 --> 01:00:53,298
-Get out.
-Well, he called me for advice.

577
01:00:53,506 --> 01:00:55,496
-lt's a little hard to explain.
-Try.

578
01:00:55,708 --> 01:01:01,271
l believe that there is 
something evil
in this house...

579
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:04,006
...something no longer living
and not yet passed over.

580
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:05,582
And it wants your son.

581
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:08,653
That's a dangerous situation
for someone who's close to death--

582
01:01:08,856 --> 01:01:10,084
He's not.

583
01:01:10,691 --> 01:01:16,151
And l'm as hopeful as you,
but tell me, have you not...

584
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,364
...felt something strange here?

585
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:25,771
l don't know what you're talking 
about.

586
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:29,808
l appreciate the concern, but 
this is
not the type of help we need 
right now.

587
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:31,944
l'd like you to leave.

588
01:01:32,446 --> 01:01:33,971
Of course.

589
01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:42,919
You're not alone.

590
01:03:43,584 --> 01:03:45,415
Peter?

591
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,028
Matt?

592
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:36,231
You're kidding.

593
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,368
Hello!

594
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:41,237
Anybody home?

595
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:42,810
All the lights are on!

596
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,408
Why are all the lights on?

597
01:04:49,254 --> 01:04:50,515
Ridiculous.

598
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:54,515
Everybody in this house is 
sleeping...

599
01:04:54,759 --> 01:04:57,352
...with the lights on
and l wanna know why!

600
01:04:57,562 --> 01:04:59,587
He's been drinking.

601
01:05:01,432 --> 01:05:04,094
Why don't we just build a fire
and throw money into it?

602
01:05:04,802 --> 01:05:05,769
lt's okay.

603
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,599
l gotta pay a mortgage,
l'm now paying rent.

604
01:05:08,806 --> 01:05:10,535
Here's another one.

605
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,838
God.

606
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:17,240
Every single room has got a 
light on!

607
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:32,760
Here. Here we go.

608
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:35,364
Sleep in the dark.

609
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:48,705
There we go.

610
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:50,940
Lights out.

611
01:05:54,654 --> 01:05:56,486
There we go.

612
01:05:57,124 --> 01:05:58,750
Yeah.

613
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:04,931
Peter...

614
01:06:05,934 --> 01:06:09,426
...that was a cruel
and childish thing to do.

615
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:13,601
All you did was scare everybody
in this house.

616
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:18,475
Don't. Don't. Don't.

617
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:26,778
Your family needs your strength,
not your self-pity.

618
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:33,357
You get drunk again, don't come 
home.

619
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:39,297
Matt?

620
01:07:52,144 --> 01:07:53,111
Okay.

621
01:08:07,828 --> 01:08:10,058
l'm so sorry.
l just didn't know who else
 to call.

622
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:11,690
lt's all right.

623
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:15,835
-Are you sure you're feeling 
up to this?
-Well, put it this way, l'm....

624
01:08:16,204 --> 01:08:19,298
l'm exactly the right state of
 being...

625
01:08:19,507 --> 01:08:21,065
...to traffic with ghosts.

626
01:08:26,614 --> 01:08:28,275
What is that?

627
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:30,907
Magnets. lron magnets.

628
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:32,450
lron defends from evil.

629
01:08:33,454 --> 01:08:37,322
So it's no accident
that prisons have iron bars...

630
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:41,724
...to not merely contain the 
body,
but the evil that may lurk
 within it.

631
01:08:50,473 --> 01:08:52,736
-What are you looking for?
-Where he died.

632
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:58,546
Sometimes when death is violent
or filled with anger...

633
01:08:58,747 --> 01:09:04,583
...or fear or any strong emotion...

634
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:08,183
...it's as if the spirit doesn't
 pass on.

635
01:09:11,628 --> 01:09:16,430
That's why we cover mirrors,
light candles, open the shades...

636
01:09:16,634 --> 01:09:19,124
...so that they may find their
 way out.

637
01:09:19,469 --> 01:09:25,374
So a house with a trapped soul
is not so much haunted...

638
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:29,304
...as it is possessed.

639
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:39,018
What's down there?

640
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:43,789
Matt's bedroom.
lt's where they used to....

641
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:48,261
Keep the children upstairs.

642
01:09:59,711 --> 01:10:00,838
Yeah.

643
01:10:01,046 --> 01:10:02,105
He's here.

644
01:10:02,315 --> 01:10:03,907
Do you see him, Matt?

645
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:07,877
l don't see anything.

646
01:10:08,087 --> 01:10:11,682
That's because you're strong,
 you're
healthy. You shouldn't see 
anything.

647
01:10:43,925 --> 01:10:46,359
So this is where you're trapped.

648
01:10:48,796 --> 01:10:50,525
Don't worry.

649
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:54,368
Whatever you may have done,
we're not here to punish you...

650
01:10:56,437 --> 01:10:58,804
...only to free you.

651
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:01,240
Like a bird...

652
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:04,174
...caught in a room.

653
01:11:17,393 --> 01:11:19,624
There must be another way.

654
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,591
Perhaps the other side of that 
wall.

655
01:11:25,835 --> 01:11:29,794
l have to get his remains
out of the house.

656
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:51,418
Stop it!

657
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,689
lt stopped.

658
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:46,905
Will Matt be all right now?

659
01:13:47,116 --> 01:13:48,277
Yeah.

660
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:50,248
The house is quiet and at peace.

661
01:13:50,887 --> 01:13:54,880
But l should warn you that 
sometimes
for a day or so after...

662
01:13:55,959 --> 01:14:00,862
...strange events, much like 
aftershocks
from an earthquake.

663
01:14:01,164 --> 01:14:03,861
But don't be alarmed...

664
01:14:04,335 --> 01:14:06,632
...it will pass,
within a day or two at the most.

665
01:14:17,615 --> 01:14:18,582
-Okay.
-All right.

666
01:14:21,052 --> 01:14:22,383
Thank you.

667
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,650
lt's okay.

668
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:30,895
l wish l could say
it was my pleasure, but....

669
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,331
You gonna be okay to drive?

670
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:38,969
We're all in God's hands.

671
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:12,772
It's only five more sleeps
till parents' day.

672
01:15:12,973 --> 01:15:14,940
I can't wait.
I got a lot to show you, Dad.

673
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:17,167
You'll see
how I shoot the bow and arrow...

674
01:15:17,378 --> 01:15:21,610
...and how far I can swim
and they're having a father-son 
race.

675
01:15:21,815 --> 01:15:22,839
It's gonna be great.

676
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,145
I bet you and me,
we beat all the others...

677
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:29,618
...unless you're too old
and broke down.

678
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:33,419
Okay, well, I better go. Bye, Dad.

679
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,594
All right,
whatever was here is gone now.

680
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,099
Now, we've all had
some really bad nights.

681
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,783
Stay here.

682
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:04,756
Oh, my God.

683
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,123
Oh, my-- Oh, my--

684
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:10,926
Oh, my God.
What have you done to yourself?

685
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:19,199
All right, l'm gonna follow 
them. When
l get back, we're getting out 
of here.

686
01:18:14,663 --> 01:18:16,495
Sir?

687
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:20,366
They'll be after you now.

688
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,003
Get out.

689
01:19:00,211 --> 01:19:01,371
Somebody help me!

690
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:15,555
Please! Somebody help me!

691
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,118
Where's Matt?

692
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:15,812
He's at the hospital.

693
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:19,221
The doctors are gonna
take care of him, okay?

694
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:11,139
Hi. We're not home right now,
so please leave a message.

695
01:21:11,348 --> 01:21:12,576
Thanks.

696
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:16,754
l made a terrible mistake.

697
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:20,288
Aickman didn't remove their 
eyelids
to make the dead see...

698
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:22,426
...but to make them unseen.

699
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,959
So all those missing bodies...

700
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:29,092
...all those poor souls in torment,
they're still there. They're in 
the house.

701
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:33,195
But the boy wasn't evil.

702
01:21:33,438 --> 01:21:35,202
He was trying to free them.

703
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:36,705
And I removed him.

704
01:21:39,277 --> 01:21:41,439
Now all that's left is their
 rage.

705
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,380
You must get out now.

706
01:21:45,418 --> 01:21:46,976
Get out now.

707
01:22:27,362 --> 01:22:28,920
l'm sorry.

708
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:33,600
lt's okay. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

709
01:22:37,606 --> 01:22:40,472
He's sedated and comfortable.

710
01:22:41,075 --> 01:22:42,475
We ran his panels.

711
01:22:43,512 --> 01:22:45,446
l'm afraid it's not good news.

712
01:22:45,647 --> 01:22:47,342
His cell count is worse than 
before.

713
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:51,015
The treatment has, frankly,
had no effect.

714
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:55,718
How long do you think he has?

715
01:22:55,924 --> 01:22:58,826
With these numbers,
l don't know what's keeping 
him alive.

716
01:22:59,029 --> 01:23:00,928
He could go tonight.

717
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:03,827
There's really no way of saying
 for sure.

718
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:07,661
Then can we see him?

719
01:23:08,505 --> 01:23:10,336
Of course.

720
01:23:12,108 --> 01:23:13,268
To fight.

721
01:23:13,477 --> 01:23:15,307
One bright day
In the middle of the night

722
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:17,538
Two dead boys got up to fight

723
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:19,010
He couldn't have gotten far.

724
01:23:19,216 --> 01:23:21,741
-One bright day in the middle--
-Hi, this is Dr. Brooks.

725
01:23:21,951 --> 01:23:23,715
Get me security right away, 
please.

726
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:25,548
Two dead boys got up to fight

727
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:27,121
One bright day
In the middle of the night

728
01:23:27,324 --> 01:23:29,656
Two dead boys got up to fight

729
01:23:38,235 --> 01:23:39,931
Matt?

730
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,667
Matt?

731
01:23:44,009 --> 01:23:45,738
Matt.

732
01:24:00,693 --> 01:24:01,716
Come over. Come here.

733
01:24:04,129 --> 01:24:05,961
We're gonna play
hide-and-seek now, okay?

734
01:24:06,165 --> 01:24:07,792
Okay, go.

735
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:13,562
-We have to get out of here.
 Come on.
-What's going on?

736
01:24:13,773 --> 01:24:15,536
We have to go. We have to--

737
01:24:16,076 --> 01:24:17,633
Matt. Matt, no.

738
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,039
Matt, no. No.

739
01:24:25,986 --> 01:24:27,647
-Get out.
-Matt.

740
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,550
Get out.

741
01:24:29,756 --> 01:24:32,554
Matt. No. Matt.

742
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:35,456
Get out. Whatever you do,
do not let them put out the fire.

743
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:37,562
-What about you?
-l'm already dead.

744
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:42,466
-Matt, come out. Matt.
-Matt.

745
01:24:45,773 --> 01:24:47,536
We'll find him.

746
01:29:02,943 --> 01:29:05,172
Mom. Dad.

747
01:29:06,146 --> 01:29:07,113
Where's Matt?

748
01:29:07,314 --> 01:29:09,509
-He's inside.
-l don't understand.

749
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:12,345
-l thought you said it was over.
-Matt's trying to end it.

750
01:29:12,553 --> 01:29:13,577
-l gotta get in.
-Ma'am.

751
01:29:13,788 --> 01:29:16,780
No, you gotta let me in there.
l have to get my son.

752
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:19,892
-Fire.
-Please let me go. Please.

753
01:29:20,094 --> 01:29:21,925
To unbind the spirits.

754
01:29:46,288 --> 01:29:48,154
What are we waiting for? Come 
on!

755
01:29:48,356 --> 01:29:50,086
Matt!

756
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,464
Oh, my God.

757
01:30:06,043 --> 01:30:08,010
Okay.

758
01:30:10,981 --> 01:30:12,641
All right.

759
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:17,142
l'm here. l'm here.

760
01:30:41,179 --> 01:30:42,703
The Lord is my shepherd.

761
01:30:42,914 --> 01:30:44,542
l shall not want.

762
01:30:44,782 --> 01:30:47,216
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

763
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:50,486
He leadeth me beside the still
 waters.

764
01:30:51,323 --> 01:30:53,620
He restoreth my soul.

765
01:30:53,826 --> 01:30:56,056
He leadeth me
in the path of righteousness.

766
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:03,497
He helped my son.

767
01:31:27,895 --> 01:31:32,457
We're here. We're here. We're
 here.

768
01:31:46,682 --> 01:31:48,376
Matt.

769
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:56,186
Be careful.

770
01:31:58,594 --> 01:32:00,118
Come on, wake up.

771
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:01,957
Wake up.

772
01:32:02,165 --> 01:32:04,359
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

773
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:18,109
No. Hold on.

774
01:32:18,314 --> 01:32:20,111
Wake up.

775
01:32:32,462 --> 01:32:35,159
Come on, Matty.
Come on, Matty, breathe.

776
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,460
l love you.

777
01:32:51,782 --> 01:32:53,876
Wake up, Matt.

778
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,321
I just love you so much.

779
01:33:02,794 --> 01:33:04,352
Come on, Matty, wake up.

780
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:08,027
Please, come on, honey.

781
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:11,092
Come on.

782
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:19,303
You'll be all right.

783
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:38,320
Hey.

784
01:33:49,209 --> 01:33:51,234
He's okay.

785
01:34:10,098 --> 01:34:13,727
I don't really care
if anybody believes me or not.

786
01:34:14,569 --> 01:34:16,800
I know what happened.

787
01:34:17,005 --> 01:34:21,999
Doctors and nurses know
and my family knows.

788
01:34:23,812 --> 01:34:26,838
And my son is alive...

789
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:30,142
...and well.

790
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:33,247
That's all that matters.

791
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:37,822
They say that God works
in mysterious ways.

792
01:34:38,828 --> 01:34:42,594
They just don't always tell you
how mysterious those ways can be.

793
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,893
Consider yourself warned.
