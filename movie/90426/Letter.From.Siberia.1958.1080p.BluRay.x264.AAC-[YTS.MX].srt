This restoration was made
from the internegotive in 2013

00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:06,126
by Eclair Group (image)
and L.E. Diapason (sound)

00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,835

00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:10,001
One of the challenges
posed by every restoration

7
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,335
is to differentiate accurately

8
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,751
between the imperfections
originally present on the negative

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,335
(which must remain uncorrected)

10
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:16,835
and those caused by wear and tear.

11
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:20,293
Inspired by Chris Marker's words of warning
"Do not believe more is befier"

12
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,543
we have left uncorrected the mishaps
of a temperamental lens,

13
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,626
the lens hood, and hairs in the gate.

19
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:54,460
<i>What was the use
Of creeping into the Ark</i>

20
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,835

<i>In the midst of silence</i>

39
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:32,001
<i>When Yves Montand's voice</i>

40
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:37,335
<i>Comes over the short-wave</i>

41
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:45,585
<i>The branches of Paris chestnut trees</i>

42
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:50,710
<i>Come and peer into my window</i>

43
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:56,793
<i>When our distant friend sings</i>

44
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:01,460
<i>Warmth and joy spread everywhere</i>

45
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:07,126

<i>Giving candy to the little children</i>
