1
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,323
I'm writing you this letter from a distant land.

2
00:00:57,953 --> 00:00:59,339
Its name is Siberia.

3
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:04,110
For most of us, that name suggests
nothing but a frozen devil's island -

4
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:09,088
and for the czarist general Andreyevich,
it was the biggest vacant lot in the world.

5
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:13,092
Fortunately, there are more things on heaven
and earth than any general...

6
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,711
Siberian or not, has ever dreamed of.

7
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:22,831
As I write, I let my eye stray along the edge
of a grove of birch trees,

8
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:28,125
and I remember that in Russian, their name is
a word of love: beryozca.

9
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:37,805
This might be autumn in Yorkshire
or Connecticut...

10
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:41,347
if it weren't for these telegraph workers,
booted like Mikhail Strogoff,

11
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:45,017
going through the motions of shoemakers at the
altitude of tightrope walkers.

12
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:48,071
they convince you that you're
looking at Siberia,

13
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:51,714
and it's not just the local color: 
the boots, the fur caps...

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,201
and the peppermint collars
around their horses' necks.

15
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:57,364
It's the realization, for example,
that if one of these

16
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:00,139
climbing Cossacks absentmindedly
reeled in his line

17
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:05,070
he'd find himself holding a ball
of wire 4800 miles long.

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,271
This gash in the forest means the city
has gone by like a wild animal;

19
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:13,151
follow the wrong trail and you may
come to a bear or a tiger,

20
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,777
follow the right one and
you'll come to a city.

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,794
Angarsk, 180 miles from the railroad.

22
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,724
The city was planned in 1947,

23
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:26,448
but it took four years to cut a path
through the forest,

24
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,346
yard by yard, to reach
the Trans-Siberian.

25
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,202
The foundation stone was laid in 1951.

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,135
Today it has 100,000 inhabitants,

27
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:38,497
including the 35,000 children born
during construction,

28
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:41,440
natives of the city which didn't yet exist.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
When you've left the last house
behind you though,

30
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,967
you're back in the Stone
Age forest: the taiga.

31
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:24,791
I'm writing you this letter from
the edge of the world.

32
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,022
According to a Siberian proverb,
the forest was made by the devil.

33
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,083
The devil did a good job;

34
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,311
his forest is as big as the United
States of America.

35
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:37,187
But maybe the devil made
the United States too.

36
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:42,421
When he's not busy making forests, or states,
the devil steals peoples' souls...

37
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:46,106
or at least that was how the Siberians regarded
death for many centuries.

38
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:49,109
In this frozen ground, corpses never rot.

39
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:52,229
In these graves, which rest on
foundations of ice,

40
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,479
life and death are separated by nothing
more substantial than a breath of air.

41
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:00,479
Bring back the breath and the
body is ready to live again,

42
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,461
to come back and share in the slow chilly
existence of the wooden villages,

43
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,406
rounding up stray horses,
building snowplows...

44
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,767
or leading herds on their pilgrimage
to milder pastures.

45
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:06,426
This morning I saw a kolkhoz of ducks.

46
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,981
The duck is collectivistic by nature.

47
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,372
There are no kulaks among ducks.

48
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,260
It was a cold morning, and out of
sympathy for the cameraman,

49
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,418
and to promote friendship
between peoples,

50
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,327
they gladly gave an exhibition of naval
maneuvers on the freezing water,

51
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,398
at the risk of being trapped in the ice.

52
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,516
Which was the sad fate of a bigger,
more famous...

53
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:30,502
and much rarer animal in this same
part of the world: the mammoth.

54
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,872
<i>The mammoth elephants of old Siberia</i>

55
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:40,253
<i>Dreamt of a holiday in Iberia</i>

56
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,312
<i>Fleeing the Ukase and the Knout</i>

57
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,460
<i>Quite a few got lost en route</i>

58
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,670
<i>Thirty centuries later
we had to dig them out.</i>

59
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,101
Oddly enough, the only animal which
the Siberians and the Chinese...

60
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:55,353
could conceive to be related to the
mammoth was the mole.

61
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,279
They were convinced that he was
one of the giant variety -

62
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:01,792
digging huge tunnels and humping
the earth with his forehead.

63
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:07,439
That imposing animal's weak spot was his
extreme sensibility to sunshine.

64
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:11,872
If he was struck by a single ray of light,
he died, instantly.

65
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:15,439
And the proof of this, said the Chinese
- who were strong on logic -

66
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:18,843
was that whenever you met a mammoth
in the open, it was dead.

67
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,772
Hence the Chinese word
for mammoth: <i>chu-mou,</i></i>

68
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:23,570
which means 'mother of mice'.

69
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,625
For Westerners the mammoth
raised other problems.

70
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,211
They knew what he looked like.

71
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:46,610
He'd had his portrait painted by some of the most
popular artists of prehistoric times.

72
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,853
His publicity agent was Father Breuil.

73
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:56,429
And anyway, mammoths had always been
on good terms with the church:

74
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,476
a mammoth's tooth attributed
to St. Christophorus,

75
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,084
was worshipped in Valencia...

76
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:04,718
and as late as 1789 a mammoth's
thigh bone...

77
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:07,019
presumed to have come from
St. Vincent's own skeleton...

78
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:09,818
was still carried in the Saints
Day procession.

79
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,070
When the first mammoths were
discovered in the 18th century,

80
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:16,143
the effect on public opinion
was unspectacular.

81
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:20,958
It wasn't until 1900 that the mammoth
became wildly fashionable,

82
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:25,021
after hardy pioneers had made
forays into the Siberian wasteland...

83
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:28,262
and brought back quick-frozen
mammoths in the flesh.

84
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,392
<i>Men of science in that
rugged clime</i>

85
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,631
<i>Had to be sturdy and
still in their prime</i>

86
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,908
<i>They had to speak Yakut
loud and clear</i>

87
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,074
<i>They had to banish all
doubt and fear</i>

88
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,208
<i>In order to bring back
a mammoth by the ear.</i>

89
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:05,159
Mammoths generally appeared
after a landslide.

90
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:07,307
By the time an expedition got there,

91
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:10,009
it might have sunk back
into the ground again.

92
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,315
Or been eaten by wild animals.

93
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,882
Several skeletons were found however,

94
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,789
and even some well preserved meat.

95
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,981
Between 1707 and 1908...

96
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:45,443
18 mammoths and 6 frozen rhinoceroses
were found.

97
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:49,095
It was in the faint hope of bringing back
at least an incisor...

98
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:51,327
that we made the trek to the
nearest diggings,

99
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:54,632
on the banks of the great Siberian
river: the Lena.

100
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,154
L(i)ena, S(i)ena:

101
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:20,779
five times as long as the Seine,
and fifty times as wide...

102
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:25,754
the Lena, in Russian, is kind enough
to rhyme with our French river in Latin.

103
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,259
So just picture to yourselves
a huge lazy Seine,

104
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,654
like an assembly line running
backwards,

105
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:34,828
gradually coming to pieces at each
new dollhouse settlement,

106
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:38,072
until it reaches its destination
somewhere up north,

107
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,629
broken down into its component parts...

108
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
and spread out over an
estuary 120 miles wide.

109
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,796
It's the only highway in this
land without highways,

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,041
it's Main Street in the
Siberian village,

111
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:51,698
it's the road everybody uses.

112
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,851
And by the side of the road, 
asleep under tarpaulins,

113
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,217
waiting for transportation,

114
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:59,631
there are city buses, bulldozers,
farm machinery,

115
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,754
statues of Lenin for culture parks,

116
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:07,018
rocket mock-ups for planetariums,
imitation jeeps, and genuine Pobiedas.

117
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,075
Not to mention the crates of furs
from various animals,

118
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:14,044
such as the sable, a nasty little
beast that will make you like furs,

119
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:18,330
or the arctic fox, a sweet little thing
that would make you prefer nylon.

120
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,391
I'm writing you this letter from
the land of childhood;

121
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:22,155
between the ages of five and ten
this is where we were chased by wolves,

122
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,262
blinded by Tartars,

123
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:26,937
and carried away on the Trans-Siberian Express
with our pistols and our jewelry.

124
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:30,073
The Trans-Siberian is the longest
railway in the world.

125
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:34,478
It has carried away Anton Chekhov,
Cendrars, and Gatti .

126
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,649
I felt obliged to gather them
all together here,

127
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,982
like sacred cows under a
canopy of wild ducks,

128
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,437
to watch romanticism plus
electrification go by.

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,694
It's 7 a.m. in Irkutsk, midnight in
London and 7 p.m. in New York.

130
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,993
You're asleep or having dinner,

131
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,193
I'm looking at the Irkutsk dam,

132
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:11,017
sitting on its own reflection like
a station in outer space.

133
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,082
The morning shift goes
to work on the dam...

134
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,078
when the evening shift is
coming off at Root's.

135
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,043
And the night shift is going
on at Bethlehem Steel.

136
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:26,133
Big pressure cookers made out of Erector
Sets loom through the fog...

137
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,347
not yet moving.

138
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,033
Here, across the river Angara,

139
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:33,289
on the very spot where Mikhail Strogoff
was surrounded by fire,

140
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:36,580
they're building the biggest power
plant in Southern Siberia.

141
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,680
While Angara fishermen are already
catching their first fish,

142
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:43,173
Seine fishermen have already caught
ten in their dreams.

143
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,637
And now here's the shot
I've been waiting for,

144
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,245
the shot you've all been waiting for,

145
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:51,342
the shot no worthwhile film about a country
in the process of transformation...

146
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,138
could possibly leave out:

147
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,710
The contrast between the
old and the new.

148
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,583
On my right: the heavy duty
truck: 40 tons.

149
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:01,592
On my left: the telega, 
240 pounds.

150
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:04,969
The past and the future,
tradition and progress,

151
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:08,025
the Tiber and the Orontes, 
Philomena and Chloe,

152
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,512
take a good look because I won't
show them to you again.

153
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,651
It's one minute past seven.

154
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,432
A truck from Irkutsk makes the pontoons
bob under the floating bridge,

155
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,041
and at the same instant a
lorry honking its horn...

156
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,366
rouses 411 people out of
a sound sleep in Liverpool.

157
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,396
Four turbines are already functioning.

158
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:27,569
But the problem is not just
to light Irkutsk;

159
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:29,863
the problem is to electrify
a whole district,

160
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,939
which will constitute the base of operations
for the conquest of those frozen wastes.

161
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:35,849
This is where everything begins:

162
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:37,918
the soil reclamation program,

163
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:39,928
the increase in natural resources,

164
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,215
and the resulting rise in the
standard of living -

165
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:46,050
but also the spiritual acquisitions that
come after material transformations,

166
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,895
the way nuts come after bolts:

167
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:52,019
curiosity, contemplation, extended
horizons� and culture.

168
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,579
It's two minutes past seven.

169
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:57,146
The pressure cookers start to move.

170
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:01,390
They're real monsters, 100 feet tall.

171
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:05,336
And naturally there's a girl to go
with each monster.

172
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,030
She orders him around in
monster language,

173
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,886
and the monster obeys.

174
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:13,832
It's easy to imagine a romance
between the girl on the ground...

175
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,272
and the man in the crane.

176
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:18,213
It would be nice to be a
crane driver in Irkutsk,

177
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,564
to give your girlfriend a box of
birthday chocolates,

178
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,259
as high as a house on the
end of your hook.

179
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,671
Now the dam site comes to life.

180
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,967
Cars wend their way
between the cranes...

181
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,583
like cats playing hide and seek
in a railway depot.

182
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,036
Overhead the cranes stand aloof -

183
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:43,223
alternately courteous and curious
with one another,

184
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:44,905
like a herd of dinosaurs.

185
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,762
And the whole dam becomes
a spectacular display,

186
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:50,447
combining a Ferris wheel and
a naval battle,

187
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:53,200
and the Ville d'Este, and a pinball machine.

188
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,051
Back to the taiga.

189
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:36,487
The rationalistic aspect of Siberia,

190
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,650
is that a hiker walking in
a straight line...

191
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,129
is always sure to get
lost in the forest.

192
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:50,414
If he walks north long enough,

193
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:56,148
his reward will be 2 million 250 thousand
square miles of tundra and ice floe...

194
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:58,190
that have to be conquered
and transformed.

195
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,467
But first they have to be studied.

196
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,959
That's the job of Vladmir Malenkov...

197
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:05,576
head of the Low Temperature
Institute at Yakutskt.

198
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:09,743
In this climate, winter temperatures
can drop to 30 below zero.

199
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,830
But it's not for sentimental reasons that Vladimir
has an electric fan on his desk;

200
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,563
in summer they climb to 110.

201
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,136
In Siberia the weather jolts you...

202
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,454
- so do the roads,

203
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:23,058
but cars are insanity when you've
got a handy conveyance...

204
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,787
that suits the terrain to perfection:

205
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,304
the reindeer.

206
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:34,551
The entire economy of the Arctic peoples
is based upon the reindeer.

207
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:37,305
It serves as wheat, flax, rowboat,

208
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,900
Christmas tree, medicine chest,
and sacristan,

209
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,498
all rolled into one.

210
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,729
When gelded it serves
as a horse,

211
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,588
and is allowed to keep its beautiful
satiny antlers,

212
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,252
whereas the foolish males
cut theirs to ribbons.

213
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,784
You could go on praising reindeer forever.

214
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,326
With those velvet handlebars...

215
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,943
and the way they have of kicking themselves
along with their heels

216
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,621
they're the closest thing to a bicycle
that God ever created.

217
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,991
If I had the money, I'd shoot a spot
commercial in their honor,

218
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,640
and I'd run it between two showings...

219
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,091
or better still between two reels.

220
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,783
The picture would break off suddenly,

221
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,737
and you'd see something like this:

222
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,566
(United Productions of Siberia Presents)

223
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:22,601
"We interrupt this film not to sell you
some new miracle product,

224
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:28,703
but to remind you of an ancient irreplaceable
product to end all products: reindeer.

225
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,676
They make fine pets;
they're less of a nuisance than dogs,

226
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:36,789
less intimidating than cats,
less insidious than fleas.

227
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:40,109
Reindeer are all these things and more.

228
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:44,151
Are you dissatisfied with your car?
Reindeer will transport you.

229
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:49,008
Are you dissatisfied with your tailor?
Reindeer will dress you.

230
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:53,669
Are you dissatisfied with your doctor?
Reindeer will look after your health.

231
00:19:54,003 --> 00:19:57,305
Are you dissatisfied with your interior?
Reindeer will redecorate you.

232
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,947
Are you dissatisfied with your destiny?
Reindeer will bring you luck.

233
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,153
And don't forget that for young
and for old alike,

234
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,733
reindeer are wholesome food,

235
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,800
chock full of life giving chlorophyll.

236
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:08,785
Housewives of the world, wherever
you may be,

237
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,965
in Moscow, Rome, New York,
Peking or Paris,

238
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:17,018
beware of imitations such as moose, or elk.

239
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:20,869
Always ask for genuine reindeer."

240
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:32,813
We followed the reindeer
to the Evenks' camp.

241
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:36,243
Evenks, as you all know, are Tunguses.

242
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:39,579
Reindeer and Tunguses have
always been associated,

243
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:43,407
but it's a question whether Tunguses like
reindeer because they're useful,

244
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:46,549
or whether reindeer like Tunguses
because they're light.

245
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:50,380
For centuries Tunguses and reindeer
were nomads together.

246
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:51,807
But now all that's changed.

247
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:54,498
With a wisdom that would have
done credit to King Solomon,

248
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
they've been assigned home bases.

249
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,272
They may not show up there
for years on end,

250
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:03,354
but they've nevertheless graduated from the
dubious category of 'nomads,'

251
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:07,196
into the respectable one of
'householders on the move.'

252
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:16,512
Having presented the head of the
family with a plastic wallet,

253
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:19,158
a gift which he appreciated all the more...

254
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,619
as the Arctic world suffers from a
serious lack of Woolworth's stores,

255
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,916
we were treated to the ritual offering of
freshly sawed off reindeer antlers.

256
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,795
But don't waste your pity -

257
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:38,621
the operation hurts about as much
as trimming fingernails.

258
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:42,363
At least that's what we were told
by the grandfather in Tungus,

259
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,323
by the father in bad Russian,

260
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,155
and by the little boy in
excellent Russian.

261
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:51,523
For these children, who have inherited their
ancestors bear hunting instincts,

262
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,019
go to school, and learn trades.

263
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:57,602
This may be a bad sign for the
future of bear hunting,

264
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:00,855
as 103 year old grandfather
Innokenti says,

265
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:03,465
"Bear hunting is for youngsters.

266
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,519
When you're over eighty it
begins to be dangerous,

267
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:09,866
because in the days when
Innokenti hunted Mishka

268
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,150
- the name these people give to every bear,
as if there were only one -

269
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:17,330
he was armed with a spear,
and nothing else.

270
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,204
But Innokenti killed that single
bear eighty-five times over.

271
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,837
As for Mishka himself, 
I met him in Yakutsk.

272
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:28,166
Actually, his name was Ushatik,

273
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:29,925
which means "Little Ears."

274
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:32,448
Beneath the somewhat 
moth-eaten exterior,

275
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:34,947
due to an overturned samovar
when he was little,

276
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,581
he was a jovial, rather talkative, bear.

277
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,974
Boris Sergeivich found him in
the Taiga as a baby,

278
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,951
and he'd been a member of the
family ever since;

279
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:43,526
he was "cousin bear."

280
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:46,052
After a breakfast of red berries,

281
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,249
Ushatik the bear took his morning
walk through Yakutsk.

282
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,475
We went with him.

283
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,639
Since you can never tell how a
bear will react to a camera,

284
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,962
we were offered the protection
of an armed policeman.

285
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:59,756
But since we're much more frightened
of policemen than we are of bears...

286
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,019
we politely declined.

287
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:04,224
On our way we attracted the attention
of a group of Pioneers,

288
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,073
who were thrilled to meet
a film crew,

289
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,443
and even more so when they found
out that we were French.

290
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:12,560
Here we met with all the ingredients of
the Soviet citizens' incredible,

291
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:14,922
rather touching, admiration
for our country:

292
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:18,223
one quarter French Revolution,
one quarter Zola's novels,

293
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,402
one quarter Com�die-Fran�aise,
one quarter secret passion for Gay Paris,

294
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,411
and four quarters Yves Montand�

295
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:09,997
As I listened to this tribute to Yves Montand
I looked around me.

296
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,832
Undeniable energy, enthusiasm,
and the will to work.

297
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,542
A faith that the future will be as bright
as the past was dark.

298
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:20,341
Huge gaps, and a firm
determination to fill them.

299
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:22,966
While recording these images
of the Yakutsk capital

300
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,509
as objectively as possible,

301
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:27,458
I frankly wondered whom
they would satisfy.

302
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:30,371
Because of course you can't describe
the Soviet Union as anything...

303
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,997
but the worker's paradise,

304
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,052
or, as hell on earth.

305
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:38,227
For example: "Yakutsk: capital of
the Yakutsk...

306
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:41,583
autonomous Soviet socialistic
republic is a modern city,

307
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:44,460
in which comfortable buses made
available to the population,

308
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,971
share the streets with
powerful ZIMs,

309
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,623
the pride of the Soviet
automobile industry,

310
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:52,078
in the joyful spirit of
socialist emulation,

311
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,922
happy Soviet workers,

312
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:57,127
among them this picturesque
denizen of the Arctic reaches,

313
00:25:57,336 --> 00:26:00,878
apply themselves to making Yakutsk
an even better place to live."

314
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:05,738
Or else: "Yakutsk is a dark city
with an evil reputation.

315
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,817
The population is crammed into
blood colored buses,

316
00:26:08,957 --> 00:26:10,544
while the members of the privileged cast...

317
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,811
brazenly display the luxury
of their ZIMs...

318
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,538
a costly and uncomfortable car at best.

319
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,721
Bending to the task like slaves,

320
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,800
the miserable Soviet workers,

321
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,629
among them this sinister looking Asiatic,

322
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:26,252
apply themselves to the primitive labor
of grading with a drag beam."

323
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:30,945
Or simply: "In Yakutsk, where
modern houses...

324
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:33,204
houses are gradually replacing
the dark older sections,

325
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,150
a bus less crowded than
its London...

326
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:36,936
or New York equivalent
at rush hour...

327
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:39,219
passes a ZIM, an excellent car,

328
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,972
reserved for public utilities
departments...

329
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:42,727
on account of its scarcity.

330
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:46,867
With courage and tenacity under extremely
difficult conditions, Soviet workers,

331
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:49,640
among them this Yakut, afflicted with
an eye disorder,

332
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:52,278
apply themselves to improving
the appearance of their city,

333
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:53,911
which could certainly use it."

334
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,160
But objectivity isn't the answer either.

335
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:58,476
It may not distort Siberian realities,

336
00:26:58,586 --> 00:27:00,816
but it does isolate them long
enough to be appraised...

337
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:03,494
and consequently distorts
them all the same.

338
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,386
What counts is the drive
and the variety.

339
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,134
A walk through the streets
of Yakutsk...

340
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,265
isn't going to make you
understand Siberia.

341
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,690
What you need might be an imaginary
newsreel shot all over Siberia.

342
00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:17,912
I might screen it for you in the town's
spanking new movie theater.

343
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:21,059
And the commentary would be made up of
those Siberian expressions...

344
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,065
that are already pictures in themselves.

345
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,591
"The season of dying water" is winter.

346
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:32,396
"The ghost of the winter hare" is snow,
with its foolhardy flakes.

347
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,679
"The grey ox that drank all the
water in the valley" is the frost,

348
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:39,954
which leaves trapped angry
boats behind it.

349
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:43,310
My newsreel would begin with
these images of winter...

350
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:46,084
a long white night that
lasts half the year.

351
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,098
A weather balloon would take you high over
the Verkhoyansk mountains,

352
00:27:56,786 --> 00:28:00,874
the coldest region on earth,
with a temperature of 92� below zero...

353
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:02,875
and a population of eight thousand.

354
00:28:05,995 --> 00:28:09,561
You'd see huge caterpillars carved out
of pebbles by gold mining dredges.

355
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:13,699
You'd see silver birches that look
like owls' tracks in the snow.

356
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,150
And then, as if someone had gathered
up the forest in a giant sheaf,

357
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,694
trunk against trunk, and sheared
it off with cheese wire,

358
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:23,149
you'd see Yakutsk planting
its paving stones.

359
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:28,594
You'd see a topsy-turvy world in which
houses move to their tenants on sleds,

360
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:34,924
And hunters take live animals into
the forest and set them free.

361
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,642
A year from now the hunter of the streams
will kill the beaver he's fondling today.

362
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:51,493
A year ago the trapper of the
tundra was playing...

363
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,846
with the silver fox that he's going to snare.

364
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,591
There's not much time to be sentimental
over animals...

365
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,470
whose furs are a natural resource.

366
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:01,606
For centuries past, the
country's only one.

367
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:03,978
Actually there were others though.

368
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:08,025
Siberia has turned out to have been a poor man
sleeping on a mattress stuffed with gold.

369
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,997
The problem was how to get at the mattress.

370
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:14,117
And now for the Siberian version of
Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend:

371
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:17,261
Larissa Popugayeva is a parachute
jumping geologist...

372
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,850
who was dropped into the
middle of the taiga,

373
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:21,605
in the spring of 1954, to look
for a blue layer.

374
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:25,317
After four months spent enduring
the unendurable,

375
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:26,665
she made her strike,

376
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,134
and they wound up with diamonds.

377
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:30,779
The deposit is richer than
any in South Africa.

378
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,815
To look for gold they drown the land.

379
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,697
Before the dredges scoop up
the ore and carry it away,

380
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:44,812
a kind of firemen, dressed like
mantucky wavers

381
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,050
let fly at the soil with hoses.

382
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:50,596
The real firemen are
dressed like aviators.

383
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,783
Because when there's a fire in Siberia
it's most likely to be the forest,

384
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,355
that other great natural resource
that's burning up.

385
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,393
And when there's not enough
rain to put it out...

386
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,218
they make it rain firemen.

387
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,650
To go from the forest
to the factory,

388
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:40,336
to go to the market, to school,
or on a holiday,

389
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,038
Siberians always take an airplane.

390
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:45,979
With no competition from
trucks or trains,

391
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:48,131
these planes have lost all their glamour.

392
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:50,624
They're like women in a
world without men.

393
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:52,639
They're just flying buses.

394
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,206
Except that they set you down
in out of the way places...

395
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:58,903
where you're advised to dress like a bear
if you want to pass unnoticed.

396
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,963
And then I'd show you the Yakuts.

397
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,437
Now don't get the idea they're distant
cousins of Nanook of the North.

398
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,502
They've got their artists, and surgeons,
their writers and bards.

399
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:41,432
In very ancient times the wise Eley...

400
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,677
and the daughter of the mighty Omogo�...

401
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:47,083
joined in matrimony to produce
the first Yakut.

402
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,914
But most of all I'd show you
the spring festivals,

403
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,445
when the dancers whirl, the curdled
mare's milk flows freely,

404
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:57,853
and the old shamanic poems
are revived:

405
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:07,551
<i>Approach, O stallion of the
steps and teach us,</i>

406
00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:10,919
<i>Come forth magic bull of the
universe and answer,</i>

407
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:15,625
<i>O spirits of the sun, who live
on the seven southern hills,</i>

408
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,933
<i>O jealous mothers of light,</i>

409
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,378
<i>Let your three shadows
stand tall and straight,</i>

410
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:24,857
<i>And thou in the west
on thy mountaintop,</i>

411
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:26,338
<i>O Lord my father,</i>

412
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,904
<i>With thy dreadful strength,
thy powerful neck,</i>

413
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,858
<i>Come forth with me.</i>

414
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:45,800
I'd show you the whirling dervishes
of the spring thaw,

415
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,238
and the routed armies of winter
retreating under insults,

416
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:52,365
while the whole pagan people
invent the resurrection.

417
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,671
I'd show you reindeer coming down to
meet the rising tide of warmth.

418
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,126
And further north, the last
days of winter,

419
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,471
when the reindeer shows
an athletic streak...

420
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:04,042
I'd forgotten to mention earlier.

421
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,196
And my imaginary newsreel
would end here,

422
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,918
with this Kentucky Derby in the
looking-glass world

423
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:48,625
- for which there are no losers -

424
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,181
everybody wins a prize.

425
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,215
The most treasured prize of all undoubtedly
being the return of summer,

426
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:56,357
and its companion: color.

427
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,669
Now we can go back to Yakutsk,

428
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,131
and there, in the ruthless light
of the wintry climate...

429
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,524
that has forged this country,

430
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:19,213
that has laid so many pitfalls and
landmines for its people,

431
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:23,921
we might better realize what a victory even
the simplest achievements represent:

432
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:29,052
houses protected from the cold,
schools, libraries,

433
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:30,454
and all the other things,

434
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,190
which they point out to us so proudly
we can't help smiling.

435
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:37,659
Yet, our irony may be more naive
than their enthusiasm.

436
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:55,085
Twenty years ago, Grigory
Savine is thinking,

437
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:58,150
I fought a bear right here where
we're building now.

438
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:02,369
Every Russian knows the story of the bear
that helped the peasant build his house.

439
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,162
In the end the bear turns out to be a
well-bred Stakhanovite bear,

440
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,321
who gives the whole village
a helping hand,

441
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:10,962
and who wipes his feet before
he goes into the isba.

442
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,259
The tradition must have died
out though,

443
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:16,318
since this is where I came across my
friend Ushatik again,

444
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:18,123
having a swim in the river.

445
00:36:13,558 --> 00:36:15,236
On the outskirts of Yakutsk,

446
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:17,196
as we were coming back to town,

447
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:21,366
an interested audience was watching the
antics of Ushatik the bear.

448
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,018
He'd managed to slip his leash and
was demonstrating...

449
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:27,204
his anarchist tendencies with the
shifty quickness of a puppy.

450
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,598
For a moment it even looked
like he was going...

451
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:32,130
to get his paws on Boris Sergeivich's
motorcycle.

452
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,381
Had Ushatik been corrupted by the movies?

453
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:39,333
Was he going to ride away like the trained
bears in the Moscow circus?

454
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:43,051
But no, his greediness got the better
of his thirst for freedom...

455
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:44,601
a touching sight.

456
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,406
But let cynics be comforted:

457
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,711
Boris Sergeivich watches over Ushatik with
such fatherly concern because...

458
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:53,770
he's thinking of the day not so far away
when he's going to eat him.

459
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:20,885
I'm writing you this letter from the
Land of Darkness.

460
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:23,399
That was the name Marco Polo gave it,

461
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,318
and that was the picture in the minds of
the first conquerors from Muscovy,

462
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,528
who left behind these wooden ostrogs,

463
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,975
like rooks standing on a chessboard
after the kings have died.

464
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:37,342
Schoolchildren learn how the
emperor of Russia

465
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:40,676
and the emperor of China fought over the
province of darkness.

466
00:37:41,408 --> 00:37:43,362
Since neither of them knew
the other's language,

467
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:47,287
the final treaty was drawn up in Latin
by two Jesuit priests,

468
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:49,327
the only ones who could
understand it.

469
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,814
Christianity got very little out
of that transaction.

470
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:57,372
One more evil spirit in Siberian legends
named Jesus Christ...

471
00:37:57,557 --> 00:38:00,724
is the only trace left by the interim
rule of the popes,

472
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:03,548
between the shamans and
the commissars.

473
00:38:05,585 --> 00:38:08,102
From this point on, the work of today's builders...

474
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:11,348
 runs parallel to the older themes
of Siberian mythology,

475
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,788
and the underground journey
of the black shaman,

476
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:16,218
the men and women who succeeded...

477
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,415
in making stone houses stand upright
on the Siberian soil...

478
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:21,186
have made that journey too,

479
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,127
and for the same reason.

480
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,541
I took the shamans journey down
one of the shafts...

481
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:43,692
at the Low Temperature Research
Institute.

482
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:47,706
Six Feet below the surface you
come to the ice layer,

483
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:50,518
and that frozen ground we've
mentioned already.

484
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,726
Beneath that are the caves.

485
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:57,550
I was expecting machinery, long tunnels,
and lunar landscapes -

486
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,902
but I wasn't expecting flowers.

487
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:17,687
Preserving flowers until springtime...

488
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:20,335
is merely an attractive sideline
for these technicians.

489
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:24,487
In their spare time they've invented
a Frigidaire for nostalgia.

490
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,141
But there is more to be gotten
out of this cold mine,

491
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,838
or rather this cold menagerie.

492
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,495
Here the enemy is under lock and key,

493
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:40,433
he can be studied, manipulated, and tested
to see how he reacts.

494
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:43,700
All this is done on grocer's scales in
subway corridors...

495
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:46,514
at a constant temperature of 26.6�

496
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:49,767
Apparatus that might have been borrowed
from a physics classroom

497
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:52,798
provides data on the resistance of ice
to stone and metal.

498
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:56,977
We see showcases full of frozen jewels
and earrings for a giantess.

499
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,870
We even see Andr� Gide in person,
as well preserved as the flowers.

500
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,255
The walls and ceiling of the mine are
carved out of sand,

501
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,854
solidified by the freezing temperature,
which acts like cement.

502
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:26,456
But at the slightest touch
they crumble to dust.

503
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:30,284
Seen from close up, they are
nebulae of seashells -

504
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:32,808
not so long ago the ocean was here.

505
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:36,936
However it's the future that makes the low
temperature experts' heads spin.

506
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,233
They believe that man will find hospitality
beneath the surface of this hostile land.

507
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,031
Their laboratory experiments
are the working model...

508
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:46,494
of an underground universe straight
out of science fiction.

509
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,166
Like all Russians they've read Jules Verne,

510
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:51,654
and are getting ready for the journey
to the center of the Earth,

511
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:53,722
just as their colleagues, the astronauts...

512
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,722
are giving the kickoff from Earth to the Moon.

513
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:07,450
When we surfaced again, we were a
bit dizzy from the cold,

514
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:08,877
and from looking into the future.

515
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:12,857
We pictured to ourselves the Yakutsk soccer
team playing host at last...

516
00:41:13,027 --> 00:41:15,524
to a team  from Odessa,
or even Marseilles,

517
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,282
in an underground stadium with
electronic referees...

518
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:20,476
that go 'tilt' whenever the fans boo.

519
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:24,230
There'll no longer be a season for soccer
and a season for track,

520
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,969
but perpetual springtime for all things,

521
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:28,716
including the culture parks,

522
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,573
those playgrounds for adults which winter
also empties of their visitors.

523
00:41:32,843 --> 00:41:35,623
Culture is what's left behind when
everyone has gone home.

524
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:43,768
We wandered through that
deserted freezing park.

525
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:47,082
We looked at the posters announcing
the last movies of the season.

526
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:48,932
Oddly enough the titles were familiar:

527
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,840
Fidelio, The Queen of Spades,
Don Quixote.

528
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,437
A little gypsy wind was
scraping our bones,

529
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:58,903
and in front of the library the
statue of Ordjonikidze,

530
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:02,093
bolted to its pedestal like Ulysses
lashed to his mast,

531
00:42:02,307 --> 00:42:06,635
looked as surprised as we were to see a
strange visitor at the far end of the path:

532
00:42:06,738 --> 00:42:09,444
a black horse with its legs hobbled.

533
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:16,547
Ordjonikidze had been deported to Yakutsk
before becoming its protector.

534
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:19,792
Had he also become the guardian
angel of escaped horses...

535
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:22,068
seeking refuge in this windswept
cathedral?

536
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:38,966
Like Mozart's Commendatore,

537
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:42,542
Ordjonikidze nodded at the horse and the
animal vanished into the woods.

538
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:45,826
Seeing us, he must have realized that he
was on the wrong set.

539
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:49,788
He probably reappeared instantly in a Yakutsk
legend a thousand years earlier.

540
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:54,685
Man's memory is incapable of retaining more
than one name in any given category -

541
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,400
which explains monogamy and advertising.

542
00:42:57,957 --> 00:43:02,585
In North America the gold capital was Dawson,
in Siberia it was Aldan.

543
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:06,122
This settlement used to be
called 'Camp Invisible,'

544
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:07,856
after the little river that
runs through it.

545
00:43:08,078 --> 00:43:10,315
When it became a town they
changed the name to Aldan...

546
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:11,578
because it sounded better.

547
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:15,161
The new name was taken from another river
which doesn't run through the town.

548
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:17,142
But you can't have everything.

549
00:43:17,363 --> 00:43:19,993
Fretwork windows, curtains, and
rubber plants,

550
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:22,352
there's no doubt about it we're
in Russia alright.

551
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:26,153
But let a buckboard drive by, let the
band play a little gold music,

552
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,253
and you're in frontier America.

553
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,148
Siberia had its own gold rush,

554
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:20,763
on those same steamers with
the tall smokestacks...

555
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:23,340
that would one day bring Charlie Chaplin
home a millionaire,

556
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:27,035
in those same railway stations where the
trains always stop at high noon;

557
00:44:27,215 --> 00:44:29,318
the same mirage worked its magic.

558
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,804
If you'd already struck it rich enough to buy
a ticket on the Trans-Siberian,

559
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,669
the first part of your journey
was relatively easy.

560
00:44:36,036 --> 00:44:38,129
In fact it was downright luxurious.

561
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:40,881
The Trans-Siberian, with its
drawing rooms,

562
00:44:41,027 --> 00:44:44,058
kitchens, bathrooms, pianos,
bedrooms and chapel,

563
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:46,283
was a kind of castle on wheels,

564
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,765
and it had two advantages
over most castles:

565
00:44:49,096 --> 00:44:52,431
there were no stairs to climb, 
and it went all the way across Siberia.

566
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,339
Up to this point the scenery has
been basically Russian,

567
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:57,770
but once you cross the Ienissei 
the scene changes.

568
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:00,672
The uniformed engineers were just
beginning to regret Moscow,

569
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,945
when the American 49ers were
already exploring Arizona.

570
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,781
You expected to see Indians?

571
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:11,637
Well they were there too.

572
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:12,500
Indians?

573
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,369
Cowboys?

574
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:17,913
Rustlers?

575
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,553
Trappers?

576
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:23,303
Gunfights?

577
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,395
And romances.

578
00:45:27,668 --> 00:45:30,141
While the Siberian gold rush never
mustered as many prospectors...

579
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:31,559
as its Yukon equivalent,

580
00:45:31,804 --> 00:45:35,107
it did involve 15 nationalities,
2000 professions,

581
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,382
and an unknown number
of years in prison.

582
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,967
More remarkable is the fact
that until 1927,

583
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,595
ten years after the revolution,

584
00:45:42,788 --> 00:45:45,917
the Soviet government had no control
over the Aldan district.

585
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:49,421
There were gunmen on the roads,
smugglers in the towns,

586
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,885
and gold dust would change pockets
whenever someone...

587
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,635
quick on the draw met someone quicker.

588
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:56,650
In short, you had all the ingredients
of a Western.

589
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,421
In those days knives between
the shoulder blades...

590
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:02,194
were more common than hammers and
sickles on the shirtsleeves.

591
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:05,403
As for women, they say there were
none at all in the beginning,

592
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:06,745
which is a sad thought,

593
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:10,034
and that later there was only one�
sounds even worse.

594
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:12,373
But that woman was a Communist.

595
00:46:12,654 --> 00:46:16,211
And it was she, one Judith against 4000
bearded Holophernes,

596
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:17,487
who saved the city.

597
00:46:18,088 --> 00:46:21,429
Today under the watchful gazes of a
few surviving Holophernes,

598
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:24,461
the gold diggers have become
workers like any others.

599
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:28,700
But in memory of that woman who achieved
the triumph of right over might,

600
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:32,577
the gold in Aldan is guarded and handled
only by members of her sex.

601
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:02,986
After countless doors, keys,

602
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,820
armored plates and strong boxes,

603
00:47:04,957 --> 00:47:07,440
we were finally going to see the gold.

604
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:09,054
We saw it.

605
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,097
Here it is�

606
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,050
Disappointing isn't it?

607
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:27,671
As I said before, there are two
ways of finding gold:

608
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,771
it's like catching a thief, you
can shadow him...

609
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:32,505
- in other words sink a mine shaft,

610
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:34,289
or you can throw out a dragnet -

611
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:36,288
in other words use a dredge.

612
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:58,264
But there are also the
rugged individualists.

613
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:01,518
They remind me of the old time
cross country bicycle racers,

614
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,366
before the sport became organized.

615
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:06,171
You'd see them wandering around
town at every halt...

616
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:09,554
with their bikes on their shoulders
looking for a hotel or a repair shop.

617
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:12,732
Similarly, but in their case deliberately,

618
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:16,113
the last gold diggers shun
organization and security.

619
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,594
Their technique is the same
as the dredge.

620
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:21,238
They use the old California sluice gate,

621
00:48:21,414 --> 00:48:23,977
which deposits the gold in the
bottom of a gutter.

622
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:27,904
But the dredges bring up more gold in a day
than these men do in a year.

623
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:31,442
If they became workers they'd earn
more and live far better.

624
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:33,463
But they want the gold.

625
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:39,187
The Yakut princesses were buried wearing
solid gold rings set with tiny scraps of iron

626
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:41,758
- a far more precious metal in those days.

627
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:46,298
And when I jokingly asked a worker if he
wasn't tempted by the nuggets in his care...

628
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:48,232
he answered quite sincerely,

629
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,092
"What for? I don't need any false teeth."

630
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:54,133
These are two examples of the same
healthy indifference

631
00:48:54,256 --> 00:48:56,595
before and after a short bout of fever.

632
00:48:57,181 --> 00:49:00,078
But the lone prospectors have never
gotten over the fever.

633
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,760
And perhaps they never will.

634
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:04,971
Tolerated at times, outlawed at others,

635
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:09,010
they live in the wake of the dredges like
gleaners on the heels of harvesters.

636
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:11,680
Sometimes they're drafted
for menial work,

637
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,459
but most often they're left
to their own devices.

638
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:16,768
They may well be the only
Soviet citizens...

639
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,007
not to benefit from social security,
pensions, and free medical care.

640
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:24,093
There is no earthly reason
for them to go on.

641
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:26,261
Do they have some
higher motivation?

642
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,030
I'm not so sure.

643
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,686
There is scarcely more freedom
in their individualism...

644
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:32,461
than there is gold in the mud they sift.

645
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:35,028
However they've been handling
them both for so long now...

646
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:37,252
that at times they forget which
one they're looking for.

647
00:49:37,584 --> 00:49:40,754
And perhaps in the last analysis they're
not prospecting for gold at all,

648
00:49:40,923 --> 00:49:41,982
but for mud.

649
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:50,641
As we sailed down the Lena
again on our way back,

650
00:49:50,876 --> 00:49:55,685
we didn't recognize her, the big lazy sister
of a few months ago...

651
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:59,988
had now become this black girl
studded with imitation jewels,

652
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:03,224
shimmering with sunlight that was
absent from the sky.

653
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,126
At nightfall, however, the Lena recovered
her magic powers.

654
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:52,275
We no longer thought of her merely
as a waterway,

655
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:54,997
a provider, a shepherdess for barges.

656
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,720
She was Lena the healer, the enchantress,

657
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:00,374
the cradle for monsters.

658
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,417
Kion Kiubei, the she devil 
exorcised by the popes...

659
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,388
and despised by active
party members,

660
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:23,659
has finally found her true expression
on the stage.

661
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:26,549
And the gods, devils, and heroes
of Yakutsk,

662
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,928
whose presence we sensed lurking behind
everything that had thrilled us in Siberia,

663
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:33,998
lived again before our eyes
in Yakut opera,

664
00:51:34,236 --> 00:51:37,657
side by side with the towering
shadow of Niurgun Bootor,

665
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:42,409
the legendary hero who overcame the forces
of nature to liberate mankind.

666
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:54,040
<i>I am Tiuenia Mogol,
the young warrior,</i>

667
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:58,932
<i>Iuriun Volan has captured
my bride Tuyarima.</i>

668
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,862
<i>Her body lies in chains and the
old miser of the ice flow...</i>

669
00:52:02,116 --> 00:52:04,522
<i>has her soul imprisoned
in a leather purse.</i>

670
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:07,850
<i>Yet I will set her free. Neither the wolf,
nor the otter,</i>

671
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,214
<i>neither the inquisitive fox
nor the impartial bear,</i>

672
00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:15,126
<i>nor the luminous spider spinning her
web in the Northern sky shall stop me.</i>

673
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:17,561
<i>I will wave my spear at the
constellations...</i>

674
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:20,810
<i>and drive before me with my
whip the cowering snow.</i>

675
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,536
The next morning, we came to
the Lena boulders.

676
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:51,150
The very spot where Niurgun Bootor
fought the devil.

677
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:58,788
And suddenly a chanced landing brought us
face to face with a magic larch tree,

678
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,908
on which the people hang ex-votos.

679
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:04,366
Thus, only a few miles away from
the economic planning office,

680
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:08,365
and apparently not endangering in any
way the construction of socialism,

681
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:11,785
men offer up humble objects
to an unknown god.

682
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:36,661
In the light of this tree Yakut opera
ceases to be mere folklore.

683
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:57,227
<i>- I am Kiuius, the other of Tuyarima.</i>

684
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:01,736
<i>My husband is rich, and I
have costly furs.</i>

685
00:54:02,024 --> 00:54:05,686
<i>But Iuriun Volan has stolen
my dearest fox.</i>

686
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:08,883
<i>And since thou hast gone
from my side,</i>

687
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,866
<i>thy sharp teeth o fox, gnaw
endlessly at my heart.</i>

688
00:54:14,643 --> 00:54:16,080
<i>Oh thou beloved,</i>

689
00:54:16,331 --> 00:54:18,760
<i>O thou sweet wise snow,</i>

690
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:20,276
<i>O beloved face,</i>

691
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:22,245
<i>O tree of mourning,</i>

692
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:24,421
<i>why were thou planted?</i>

693
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,208
On the banks of the Lena, the heroes
gather for the quest.

694
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:40,818
Soruk Bollur, A�yi Umsur, Aan Eskel,

695
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,468
these knights with names like swords,

696
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,622
are the Lancelots and the Galahads...

697
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:48,972
of an adventure that will take
them all the way to the pole.

698
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:52,603
Lacking a compass, they have Niurgun
Bootor's symbolic arrow,

699
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,546
 to guide them like a star.

700
00:55:08,153 --> 00:55:11,186
Today the Yakuts have other
stars to guide them.

701
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:15,267
When Sputnik added its imitation pearl
to the Northern constellations,

702
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:18,188
its coming had been expected
since the dawn of time.

703
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,961
All around us the Siberian earth
swarms with beckoning signs,

704
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:25,478
and we felt it was deeply symbolic that
the first living creatures...

705
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,299
sent into space were Siberian
dogs, the La�kas.

706
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:31,283
Switching from sleds to rockets...

707
00:55:31,385 --> 00:55:34,151
 is the Siberian way of keeping
abreast of the times.

708
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:55,417
<i>I am writing you this letter
from a distant land.</i>

709
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:57,997
Her charred trees and
empty wastelands...

710
00:55:58,096 --> 00:56:00,497
are as dear to me as her
rivers and flowers.

711
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,659
Her name is Siberia.

712
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,731
She lies somewhere between
the Middle Ages...

713
00:56:05,805 --> 00:56:07,421
and the 21st century.

714
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:09,907
Between the earth and the moon,

715
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:12,757
between humiliation and happiness.

716
00:56:13,594 --> 00:56:14,552
After that...

717
00:56:15,136 --> 00:56:16,411
it's straight ahead.
