1
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,099
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

2
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,393
Come on.

3
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:17,854
- Yeah?
- Where are you, Charlie?

4
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:20,273
More importantly, where is my money?

5
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:21,649
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- All right, all right.

6
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,693
Jack, Jack, Jack,
I am going to pay you.

7
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:25,695
This ain't Jack. It's Bill Panner.

8
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:27,405
You owe Jack money, too?

9
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,407
Charlie, you pay me first.

10
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,701
Bill, hey, no, we're good, buddy.

11
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,203
I got your money.
It's right here in my hand.

12
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:38,041
So why don't we meet up on the...

13
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,504
- Charlie, your phone's going screwy.
- Bill?

14
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,880
- Hello?
- I am losing you, Bill.

15
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,633
Wait, Charlie,
I can't hear what you're saying.

16
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:52,138
Hey, mister.
Is that Ambush?

17
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:55,600
- Uh, yeah.
- Can we see him?

18
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,229
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

19
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,149
All right, give me...
Give me a minute.

20
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,787
This...

21
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,409
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

22
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:36,516
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually, he's going to fight...

23
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,351
Whoa, little lady.
What are you doing?

24
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,563
- Can we get a picture with him?
- Sure. For five dollars.

25
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,857
You want five dollars? Seriously?

26
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:46,526
No, I want five dollars immediately.

27
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,236
Come on, guys.

28
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,946
Hey, hey.

29
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:51,531
All right, all right, I am kidding.

30
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,241
- Three bucks.
- Whatever.

31
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,910
- How about $2.50?
- You suck.

32
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,997
All right.

33
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:02,542
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

34
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,669
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

35
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,130
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

36
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,256
- Yah.
- Please take your seats.

37
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:11,217
We're almost ready
to get this thing started.

38
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,889
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

39
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,558
Hey, hey.
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

40
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:22,020
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton.

41
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,771
Time has not been good to you, my friend.

42
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,607
Ricky, we got a problem here. A big problem.

43
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,443
Whoa, hey, slow down there, hoss.

44
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,320
Come on, last time I saw you,

45
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,072
you were staring up at the ceiling
at the Sam Houston Center

46
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,533
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

47
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,533
Pow.

48
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,996
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:43,583
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

50
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,376
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

51
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,503
- That bull is, like, 2,000 pounds.
- Right, OK.

52
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:49,380
Well, Charlie, I will tell you something.

53
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,550
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid. Whoo.

54
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,427
How about that?

55
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,972
Get the hell out of here.

56
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,183
All right, all right.

57
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:02,894
Why don't we make this more interesting?

58
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,771
My bot against your bull, straight up.

59
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:06,731
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

60
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,692
- You got 20 grand, Charlie?
- In a safe in my truck.

61
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,240
All right, Charlie.
I will tell you what,

62
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,660
twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

63
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,496
I am going to come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

64
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:23,831
And you know that I can do that
because I already done done it.

65
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,458
What's the problem with you, man?
In life you get too close,

66
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,585
in the ring you
stand back like a girl. Just shake.

67
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:29,295
All right, Charlie.

68
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,005
Shake and pow.
Just like that once again.

69
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:33,007
You want to dance again?
You want to dance?

70
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,592
Come on, cheer for this guy.
Give him some luck.

71
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,552
He needs some luck, you all.
Yahoo. Let's get going.

72
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:40,181
Don't touch that bull.

73
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,850
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

74
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,270
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

75
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:50,233
Now, listen, friends, I understand,

76
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:54,153
we can't all afford to go all
the way over there to Dallas

77
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:59,200
and pay $300 for one of those World
Robot Boxing League fights. I get it.

78
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,453
So, I decided that I would
bring a robot boxing match

79
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:06,040
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

80
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,126
How about that?

81
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,794
All right.

82
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,881
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

83
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:18,761
- Ambush.
- Let's do it.

84
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,890
All right, big fella.

85
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,354
Whoo-hoo.

86
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:30,315
He's a big fella, ain't he?

87
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:33,985
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

88
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,238
Yeah.

89
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,741
Show them some power.

90
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,619
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

91
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:47,123
- Yeah.
- Yeah, big fella.

92
00:07:47,123 --> 00:07:49,542
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

93
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,753
in the baddest
of the bulls competition,

94
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:57,383
ladies and gentlemen, Black Thunder.

95
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,512
- Let's get it on.
- Let's get this thing started.

96
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,642
Is that all you got?

97
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,688
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

98
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:22,200
Take him, take him.

99
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,121
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

100
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:28,414
Woo woo.

101
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,171
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

102
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,134
OK. Jump, now.

103
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,056
Boo-yah.

104
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:49,394
- Dang it.
- Ambush, decks

105
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,437
Black Thunder
but when you mess with the bull,

106
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:53,272
you're going to get the horns.

107
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,568
You like that. I can tell.

108
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,529
You like that.

109
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,822
Jeez. Turn around.

110
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,703
Ricky. Ricky, stop this thing.

111
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,382
Come on, come on.
We're still in this thing.

112
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,842
We're still in this. Just hop. Hop.

113
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,386
That's it. Come on.

114
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,934
Ricky, enough. Enough.

115
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:33,229
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

116
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,483
Kill. Kill. Kill.

117
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,444
All right, come on. Get up.

118
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,864
Get up. Come on.

119
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,241
No.

120
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,207
Come on. No, no, no.

121
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it

122
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,720
for our warriors out here today
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

123
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,805
Now, thank you all for coming out,

124
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:11,225
and we will see you next time,
because there will be one.

125
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:13,686
Hey, hey. Give me that leg.

126
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,688
Sure. For five dollars.

127
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,523
Boo-yah.

128
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:20,276
Whoo. All right.

129
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:24,530
That was ridonculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

130
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:28,659
I am going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

131
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,828
- Everybody say "hey."
- Hey.

132
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,707
- Everybody say "ho."
- Ho.

133
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:38,127
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

134
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,230
My keys, damn it.

135
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,398
One more step
and I will drop you like your girlfriend.

136
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:00,816
Charlie, relax.

137
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,527
I am not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.

138
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,779
- It cost me my last robot.
- Just listen to us.

139
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:08,407
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?
- She's my ex-girlfriend.

140
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:11,077
I haven't seen her in like ten years.
What does she want?

141
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:14,622
- Nothing. She died.
- Do you recall Max Kenton?

142
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,084
He's my son.
He's got to be like nine.

143
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,919
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

144
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:22,838
Is he dead, too?

145
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:25,841
No, he's fine.
That's why we're here.

146
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,788
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

147
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:59,000
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,085
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.

149
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,878
Father, Charles Kenton.

150
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:05,089
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

151
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,718
Yes. As I have already told you,

152
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,845
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

153
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,181
and we can more than provide for Max.

154
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:17,977
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

155
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:19,729
next of kin retains custody.

156
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:22,940
Charles Kenton, who is aware
of this custody hearing,

157
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,609
and we are expecting him...

158
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:27,278
No, I need a new robot now.

159
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,614
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

160
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,282
I got to show up with something.

161
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,534
Noisy Boy is for sale?

162
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:37,204
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much?

163
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,540
That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

164
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,626
I can live with that.

165
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:44,170
Well, I don't have it have it.

166
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,048
Charles Kenton waived all
of his rights to custody

167
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:51,052
right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.

168
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,262
Whoa.

169
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:54,680
Please be Charles Kenton.

170
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:58,392
Uh... Charlie, yeah.

171
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:01,479
I am here to sign some paper

172
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,940
that releases my rights
to the custody of my son.

173
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,026
That's why I am here.
Do I need to be here?

174
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:09,445
Charlie.

175
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:12,156
Do you even remember me?

176
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:14,867
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?

177
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,035
- Mr. Kenton.
- Yeah.

178
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:17,244
Please take a seat.

179
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:22,500
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

180
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,001
Yes, you may.

181
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,379
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

182
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,547
You can spend some time with him,
if you'd like.

183
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,341
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

184
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,301
- Max. Your son?
- All right, all right.

185
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:35,221
You have been working with those robots
for so long, you have become one.

186
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,641
Honey, you wait right here.
I am going to be back.

187
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:41,435
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

188
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,069
Your Honor,
I'd like to, at this juncture,

189
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,947
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

190
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,407
Please.

191
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,538
Come on. Come on.

192
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,581
There you are.

193
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:05,167
He will be in a foster home.

194
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,170
No, they find good families.

195
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,005
Young, energetic. Yeah.

196
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:14,218
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

197
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,553
Oh, hey.

198
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,680
Hey, um...

199
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,891
- Marvin Barnes. I am Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

200
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,853
You know,
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

201
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:24,573
And...

202
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:29,608
- I am up for it, but...
- Seventy-five grand.

203
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:31,736
$75,000?

204
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:35,114
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,451
The thing is...

206
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:41,078
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

207
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,915
with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

208
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:46,584
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

209
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,962
We will be back in New York
by the end of August.

210
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:53,257
In August. A hundred.

211
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,342
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

212
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,762
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

213
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:01,182
if you tell her I just signed
over that kid to the state of Texas.

214
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,977
The way I see it, there's a real way
everyone gets what they want here.

215
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,271
So here's what you're going to do.

216
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:10,316
You're going to tell your wife
I will only sign over custody to her

217
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,777
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

218
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:15,362
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

219
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:19,533
for being such a terrible absentee dad
how I want to make good with junior,

220
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,702
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

221
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:26,165
She will buy it, you get to be the hero,
and everybody wins.

222
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,880
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

223
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,257
I understand.

224
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:37,802
I will give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

225
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,970
and the other 50
when we get back in August

226
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,223
and you deliver him to us in New York.

227
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:44,600
Pleasure doing business with you.

228
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,688
Your Honor, I am really happy
we all took the time

229
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,398
to make the best decision for everyone.

230
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,320
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

231
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,490
I am buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.

232
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,827
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I will meet you there.

233
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,634
Hello?

234
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,262
Bailey?

235
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,055
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

236
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,348
and I got to tell you, Charlie,

237
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,268
- it smells like disaster to me.
- Nice to see you, too, Bailey.

238
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:30,396
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up, Charlie.

239
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,481
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower?

240
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,526
- Come on.
- Let me make something clear.

241
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:38,529
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

242
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,073
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

243
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:43,367
Now, putting aside the fact
that you're doing

244
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:46,120
what I am guessing is a black market deal
on my doorstep,

245
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,205
how are you going to pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

246
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,541
The money is on its way.
Just, you know, distract him.

247
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,585
- I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best.

248
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,836
- Yeah? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:55,963
Is that why
you're buying a $45,000 robot

250
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:57,131
when you owe me six grand in rent?

251
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:58,257
- Because I am the best?
- Three.

252
00:16:58,257 --> 00:16:59,550
- No, six.
- Whoa.

253
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,679
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with
real money who wants to buy this place.

254
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,015
Come on, like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

255
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,766
If you don't make rent,
I can't make payments

256
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,268
and I won't have a choice.

257
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,937
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass if you sold this place.

258
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:15,065
My father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass.

259
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,570
Bailey.

260
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,492
- Don't.
- Don't what?

261
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,286
Don't do that. Don't... that...

262
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,079
Hey.

263
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,206
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

264
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,669
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

265
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,963
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

266
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:40,049
I used to. Once. Briefly.

267
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,051
Now I like money more.

268
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:45,929
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

269
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:49,600
Marvin.

270
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:51,894
Your money has arrived.

271
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,898
Marv.

272
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:02,863
Fifty grand, as promised.

273
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:05,991
- Now, here are all our numbers
- Right.

274
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,452
- and contact info over in Europe.
- All right.

275
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,037
So that's everything there.

276
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,085
So Marvin tells me you want
this time with Max.

277
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,462
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did the right thing

278
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,131
giving me custody. I think
Caroline would have wanted that.

279
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,758
Yeah.

280
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:25,260
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

281
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:27,638
That's a deal.

282
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:30,808
- OK, well, let's go get Max.
- OK.

283
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,644
OK? Let's get Max.

284
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:39,274
It's OK. You want me to go on the
other side here and I will get Max?

285
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,861
Hey, Max.

286
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:45,239
See you, pal.

287
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,950
Max, we will see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

288
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,128
I am Charlie.

289
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,843
It's been a long time.
You know, I am your...

290
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:08,053
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

291
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:09,263
Do you know where they're going?

292
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:11,432
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

293
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:13,642
- So how did I get stuck here with you?
- Relax, kid.

294
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:16,103
You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

295
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:19,898
Charlie, dude's pissed.
He's going to take off.

296
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:22,317
- Yeah, OK.
- Did Marvin give you that money?

297
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:25,779
Here, just close the deal.
I will be right there, OK?

298
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:28,657
- OK?
- Hey.

299
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,117
Hey.

300
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:33,036
- I am Bailey.
- Max.

301
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,248
Max Kenton.

302
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,251
- Wow, OK, so this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

303
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,545
Don't worry about it, OK?

304
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:42,963
I am standing here looking at you two...

305
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:46,175
Just go and put Noisy in the shop,
please? Thank you.

306
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:54,558
So listen, you're going to stay here
with her while I am on the road.

307
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:55,976
How much did he give you, huh?

308
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:58,020
You're coming
at this the wrong way, kid.

309
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,313
No, tell me. I want to know.

310
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,858
50,000. OK?

311
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,152
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

312
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,237
Will you shut up now?

313
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,614
You sold me?

314
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:11,366
Sounds worse than it is.

315
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:14,161
- Really.
- It's just to take care of you.

316
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:16,246
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

317
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:19,249
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I will be fine.

318
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:21,001
I told your aunt I will get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

319
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,711
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

320
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:26,089
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half.

321
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,133
I don't have it.
I spent the money on a robot.

322
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,511
It's gone. OK? Gone.

323
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,304
I am through here.

324
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,980
All right, what do we got?

325
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:45,192
Noisy Boy has arrived.

326
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:48,070
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

327
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,490
- Yep, he's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, Sao Paulo...

328
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,243
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

329
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,745
Maybe that's why you got such
a good price, genius.

330
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:02,000
Decided to stay, huh?

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,294
This is Bailey. She will be looking
after you for a few weeks.

332
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:05,379
- What?
- By the way,

333
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,965
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks or, like, eight.

334
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:12,177
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

335
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:14,555
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

336
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,265
Noisy Boy's in there.
Have you ever heard of him?

337
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:20,435
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

338
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,443
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

339
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,949
Well, his composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

340
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:37,786
I have watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

341
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:39,830
He should have had him in the third round

342
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,833
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

343
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,015
Relax, kid. He's on our side.

344
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:00,726
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

345
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:02,436
You know he
has voice recognition, right?

346
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:04,438
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

347
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,481
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

348
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:09,276
Brazilians are crazy about
that talk-to-your-robot crap.

349
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:13,864
Right, left, uppercut.

350
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:20,996
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut.

351
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:23,541
I knew that price was too good to be true.
Give me a second. We got screwed.

352
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,791
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

353
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,752
God, look how good he looks, too.

354
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:28,337
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something.

355
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:29,755
Why didn't you ask the guy
to have a look at it?

356
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,089
Relax.

357
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:37,262
Whoa, whoa.
What was that? Was that Japanese?

358
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:44,394
Let me see if I can reset him
to English. Hang on.

359
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:47,397
- How the hell do you know Japanese?
- Video games.

360
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,150
You play video games
in Japanese?

361
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,069
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

362
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,119
- Give me that.
- OK, so he's reset to English,

363
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,330
and I found his command matrix.

364
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,998
They have pre-loaded a bunch
of combinations.

365
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:08,335
- They should be listed here.
- Right.

366
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:10,963
Uh... Top salvo.

367
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,258
What did I tell you?

368
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:18,261
Gravity One Downtown.

369
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,434
I was due for some good luck.

370
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:26,311
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

371
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,356
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

372
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:45,163
- Give me the keys.
- I am coming with you.

373
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,832
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

374
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:48,792
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

375
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:52,754
I am either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

376
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:56,008
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

377
00:23:57,552 --> 00:24:01,138
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

378
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:02,264
Don't do that again.

379
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:05,017
- Don't, don't, don't.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

380
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:08,020
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa.
- Get in. Just get in, will you?

381
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,187
Give me the keys first.

382
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:10,689
No, you can wait
till I get in the truck.

383
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:12,983
Thanks, Big Pops.

384
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:19,990
Sweet ride.

385
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,159
Put on your seatbelt
and don't talk.

386
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,682
I am taking all bets.

387
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,001
Keep up. Stay close.

388
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:16,463
Hey, hey, hey.

389
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:19,091
Charlie Kenton is in the house.

390
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:20,342
All right, all right.

391
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,594
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Finn.

392
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:25,806
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

393
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,656
That's "Noisy Boy."

394
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,815
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

395
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,233
You sure you want
to fight him tonight?

396
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,486
What do you got, Finn? He can take any
bot in this place. You know it.

397
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:42,614
You can have
any undercard you want.

398
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:44,116
- Five thousand guaranteed.
- Come on, man.

399
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:47,285
A thousand
every round your bot survives.

400
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:49,830
Fight till the death.

401
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,376
No. Give me the main event.

402
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:56,670
- Come on, Charlie.
- Finn, this is Noisy Boy.

403
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,547
An original Tak Mashido bot.

404
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:01,341
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on.

405
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:05,971
You want to fight Midas?

406
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:09,266
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

407
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:12,227
Fifty? Really, 50?

408
00:26:12,227 --> 00:26:13,603
Now you're talking.

409
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:15,647
Listen, listen. No, look.

410
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:17,440
- Listen.
- Give me a sec.

411
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,442
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash

412
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:20,819
and get the hell out of here.

413
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,362
All right, first, there is no "we."

414
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:25,657
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I am going to make real cash.

415
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:28,410
We will take Midas.

416
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:37,794
Yeah.

417
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:43,550
Tonight, our main event

418
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:48,638
features the gold-blooded killer.

419
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,601
This pimped-out punk

420
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:57,105
is programmed for pain.

421
00:26:57,105 --> 00:27:02,277
I give to you the mighty Midas.

422
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,544
Whoo.

423
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:46,071
Against a bot

424
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:51,034
who ran with the big boys in the WRB.

425
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:57,040
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home

426
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,501
and he's ready to make some noise.

427
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:02,921
Take your first look in a long time

428
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:05,924
at Noisy Boy.

429
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:47,882
Crash Palace,

430
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:52,929
who's ready for some destruction?

431
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,684
Let's make some money. Come on.

432
00:28:57,684 --> 00:29:00,603
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

433
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,981
Noisy Boy against Midas.

434
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:06,359
You have been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace.

435
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,742
Scimitar right.

436
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,663
Did you see that?

437
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:21,791
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long.

438
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:25,086
Come on. It's not over yet. Let's go.

439
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:27,380
Skull salvo. Firefight.

440
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,886
- Yeah. Go, Noisy.
- Undercard, huh?

441
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:36,806
Shockfist.

442
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:41,853
Get in there. Shogun Trinity.

443
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,732
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown.

444
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:50,695
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy.

445
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:51,988
Get up.

446
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:55,408
Full Metal Feud. Bring it.

447
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:00,538
Southpaw. Pain Revolution.

448
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,249
I got something for you.

449
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,546
Don't you run from me.
You can't run from me.

450
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,632
Get up.

451
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:15,261
That's illegal.

452
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:17,263
This is the underworld, kid.
There are no rules.

453
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,682
Now we're seeing
the Midas touch.

454
00:30:19,682 --> 00:30:21,059
No. Hands up.

455
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,312
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man.

456
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,776
He's getting killed in there.

457
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:36,574
It's a headset. You talk into it
and you tell him what to do.

458
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:38,159
Panic Shield.

459
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,162
That's it. One-Two Overlord.

460
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,585
No, no. Shatter Punch.

461
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:53,967
- Five Recall.
- Get some.

462
00:30:57,763 --> 00:30:59,639
Jeez, damn it.

463
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,182
Jab, jab.

464
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:10,275
Right roundhouse. Roundhouse.

465
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:13,153
Did he just spit
his juice in Midas's face?

466
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:15,822
No, you did not spit in Midas's face.

467
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:19,742
- It's party time now, Crash Palace.
- Use your left.

468
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,912
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm.

469
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:25,707
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work.

470
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:33,590
No, no, no. Get up.

471
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,134
Get some.

472
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:37,760
He's got...
Just got to get to the bell.

473
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,096
Move. Get out of the corner.

474
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,101
Midas. Midas. Midas.

475
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:48,855
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino.

476
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:51,941
I got something for you.
You ready?

477
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:56,404
Good night.
That's a home run for Midas.

478
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:59,616
And so long to Noisy Boy.

479
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:15,798
Midas. Midas. Midas.

480
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,567
Well, that sucked. You hungry?

481
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,945
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

482
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,948
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

483
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:43,535
I need to find a mainframe. What?

484
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:45,537
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

485
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:47,205
Fine, more for me.

486
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:48,915
Here, drink this.

487
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:50,667
You never should have taken that fight.

488
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,545
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

489
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:56,464
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

490
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:58,716
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

491
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:02,387
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

492
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:04,806
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

493
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:06,724
Of course he lost.
You never gave him a chance.

494
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:09,477
- He wasn't that good.
- Noisy Boy was a great robot.

495
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:12,397
Was. Was a great robot back
in the League, back in the day.

496
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:14,107
But look around you, kid. This place...

497
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:16,526
This place is where once great robots
go to die.

498
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:19,279
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?

499
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,322
Anything you don't need
you just throw away.

500
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:25,368
Wow.

501
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:27,996
It's been a long night.

502
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:31,124
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

503
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:33,876
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck.

504
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:04,282
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.

505
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:24,469
You stay put.
I am going to go look for some parts.

506
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,220
- I am coming with you.
- Huh?

507
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,764
That drink has my heart pounding.

508
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,099
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

509
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,726
Whatever. Just keep up.

510
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,238
Crap.

511
00:34:44,238 --> 00:34:45,615
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

512
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,837
All right, keep up.

513
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:01,964
These searchlights are automated,

514
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:04,425
but you got to time them right,
so stay close.

515
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,011
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

516
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,931
Keep up. It's all right.

517
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:12,600
All right. Come on, come on.

518
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:15,228
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

519
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,898
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

520
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:23,027
Quick, quick. Down in here. Go, go, go.

521
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,199
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

522
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,203
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights.

523
00:35:32,203 --> 00:35:34,163
Quick. Go, go, go.

524
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:52,306
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

525
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:55,226
Anything. Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

526
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,644
- Hey, look.
- What?

527
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,399
It's so small.

528
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:04,610
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One,

529
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,822
the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.

530
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,907
The more human, the better.

531
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:12,618
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Here, put that in the cart.

532
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:13,995
What changed?

533
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:16,038
A good question.
Boxing, human boxing.

534
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:17,999
- It just faded.
- Why?

535
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,293
Because the money moved on.

536
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:22,962
People wanted more carnage,
more show.

537
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:25,339
You had the whole Brazilian
underground,

538
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:28,342
the Gracies, the Machados,
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,

539
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:31,554
and 1,000 styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.

540
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:32,847
- Look at this.
- What's that?

541
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:35,808
- I don't know.
- Not bad. Good spot, kid.

542
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:39,103
You still had human fighters,
human bodies

543
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:41,439
so you couldn't
give the people what they really wanted:

544
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:44,776
true, no-holds-barred violence.

545
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:48,654
So the next logical step:

546
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:51,866
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

547
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,077
Do you miss it?

548
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,457
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

549
00:36:59,457 --> 00:37:01,125
What? I want to know.

550
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,960
Careful, you're on a cliff.

551
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:07,089
Whoa.

552
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,593
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

553
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,099
- Charlie.
- Max.

554
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:21,771
Charlie, help me.

555
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,131
Charlie.

556
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,593
Charlie. Max. Max.

557
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:54,593
Max.

558
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:57,431
Max. Max.

559
00:37:57,431 --> 00:38:01,519
- Try not to move.
- I am on some sort of robot arm.

560
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,648
Wait. Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

561
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:08,943
Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.

562
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:12,530
Look at me. Look at me.
That's it. I have got you, Max.

563
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,198
You don't have to be scared. I got you.

564
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:16,701
- It's so far.
- It's OK. I got you.

565
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:19,203
Give me your other hand.
Nice and slow.

566
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:21,956
Just give me your other hand
very slowly.

567
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:24,250
Reach back. Come on. Reach.

568
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,461
All right, look at me.
We're going to do this together.

569
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:29,380
You and me.
Just look at me.

570
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,591
That's it. That's it.

571
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:35,303
One... two... three.

572
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,307
That's it. I got you.

573
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:42,727
I got you. I got you. I got you.

574
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:46,230
I got you. I got you.

575
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:51,852
You're safe. You're safe.

576
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:56,991
All right, I got you.

577
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:58,451
- You all right?
- Yeah.

578
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,536
Come here. Easy. Easy.

579
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:03,789
You all right?

580
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:06,000
- You all right?
- Yeah.

581
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,877
I told you it was dangerous.

582
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:10,463
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

583
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:26,270
Charlie, I think there's
a whole robot in there.

584
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,813
So what? Let's go. Come on.

585
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,900
I am taking him with me.
He saved my life.

586
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,570
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

587
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,073
Could you just bring the cart to the
edge? I will use the winch to get him out.

588
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:40,785
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I am through here.

589
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:27,892
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

590
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:30,186
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition

591
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:33,022
to the front of the Crash Palace.

592
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:35,733
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

593
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:39,028
Yeah, good idea. You're broke.
I am almost there myself.

594
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,739
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We will put one together.

595
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:43,991
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

596
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:45,701
- No, there's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

597
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:50,247
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.

598
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:52,833
You're not even
in the game anymore, Charlie.

599
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,919
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

600
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,837
Don't get loud with me.

601
00:41:56,837 --> 00:41:59,131
- You're your problem, Charlie.
- What's that supposed to mean?

602
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:03,344
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring,

603
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,596
and the whole ugly spiral down,
and I am tired.

604
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:09,183
My father invested everything
he had in your fight career.

605
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:10,643
We loved...

606
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:16,774
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

607
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:19,610
I am just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

608
00:42:20,987 --> 00:42:22,321
What's yours?

609
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,626
You're done, right?

610
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:36,961
You're finally done?

611
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:40,548
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

612
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:43,217
I got nothing left.

613
00:42:45,303 --> 00:42:46,303
All right.

614
00:42:48,557 --> 00:42:51,392
Maybe there's something here.
This robot the kid brought in last night.

615
00:42:51,392 --> 00:42:53,936
Maybe there's something here.
This robot the kid brought in last night.

616
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:55,771
Would you look at it for me?

617
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:57,439
Please?

618
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,151
Bailey?

619
00:43:06,032 --> 00:43:08,117
I have never seen
anything like it before.

620
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:10,286
He's Generation Two, but barely.

621
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:12,413
I found a power cell that fits him,

622
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:15,833
and I hooked him up
to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...

623
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,960
You can at least move him around,
Charlie, but he's crap.

624
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,963
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

625
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:24,091
- Charlie, stop.
- It's my robot.

626
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:27,303
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there.

627
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:29,054
- He's mine.
- He's yours? Yeah.

628
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:31,682
But the parts we're
putting in him are mine.

629
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:36,437
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you start fighting over him.

630
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:37,855
What happened to you?

631
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,402
Hey.

632
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:56,457
Whoa. Whoa.

633
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:58,334
Watch out. Stay back.

634
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,772
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

635
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:22,900
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory, Max.

636
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,235
You think there's
anything here we could use?

637
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:27,237
- Not much.
- There's a bucket...

638
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:30,407
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck sometimes.

639
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:33,452
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

640
00:44:33,452 --> 00:44:36,538
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

641
00:44:36,538 --> 00:44:40,250
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

642
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,962
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

643
00:44:42,962 --> 00:44:45,881
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

644
00:44:45,881 --> 00:44:48,842
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

645
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:50,552
Cool.

646
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:26,296
"Atom."

647
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:36,932
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

648
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:38,684
I don't think he
was ever a boxing robot.

649
00:45:38,684 --> 00:45:42,604
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

650
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:44,273
They must have built robots
like this one

651
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:46,275
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

652
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:48,694
OK, so can we get him a fight?

653
00:45:48,694 --> 00:45:51,196
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

654
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:54,074
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

655
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:55,826
You could always sell him off for parts.

656
00:45:55,826 --> 00:45:57,286
Can't you get him a fight?

657
00:45:57,286 --> 00:45:59,496
"Why can't you get him a fight?
Get him a fight."

658
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:01,457
God, you don't quit, do you?

659
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:04,460
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

660
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,379
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

661
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:09,840
The places that would
let you fight this robot

662
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,717
would make you pee your little pants.

663
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:14,303
Excellent. Get him a fight.

664
00:46:20,393 --> 00:46:21,351
Stubborn kid.

665
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:23,479
Surprise, surprise.

666
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:06,188
Let's take a walk.

667
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,384
Can you understand me?

668
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:28,520
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

669
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,006
You have known Charlie a long time.

670
00:48:56,006 --> 00:48:59,509
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

671
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:02,804
My dad, he trained him.

672
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:06,642
That's them. That's Charlie.

673
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,979
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

674
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,481
As anything.

675
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:17,277
He was something.
He was lean, tough.

676
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:19,279
No quit, no fear.

677
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:26,536
Come here.
I want to show you something.

678
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,667
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

679
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:35,420
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

680
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,382
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
- I was.

681
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:41,218
Charlie was just supposed
to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

682
00:49:41,218 --> 00:49:45,013
Nico wasn't
even supposed to break a sweat but

683
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:50,268
nobody told Charlie that, so he just
kept coming and coming at him.

684
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:51,770
Check this out.

685
00:49:54,565 --> 00:49:56,483
That's Charlie.

686
00:49:57,652 --> 00:49:59,361
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls

687
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:00,737
on this nobody.

688
00:50:00,737 --> 00:50:05,117
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

689
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:07,119
- Really?
- Really.

690
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,037
He was toying with Nico.

691
00:50:09,037 --> 00:50:12,082
The top contender,
number two in the world

692
00:50:12,082 --> 00:50:15,544
and Charlie was dancing with him.
Pop. Pop. Bam. Pop.

693
00:50:15,544 --> 00:50:18,755
Charlie was floating inches
off the canvas that night.

694
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:21,758
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

695
00:50:23,052 --> 00:50:24,052
I could.

696
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:31,018
He was beautiful.

697
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:36,523
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

698
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:40,485
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

699
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:42,320
Second time for good. Lights out.

700
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,573
You were ahead on the scorecards
going into the 12th round.

701
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:47,617
Nico Tandy rung my bell
and went on to be the undefeated

702
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:49,119
world champ for the next three years.

703
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,997
- So he knocked you out?
- Yeah, so did a lot of guys.

704
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:53,331
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

705
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:55,375
24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.

706
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:57,002
But every fight a knockout.

707
00:50:57,002 --> 00:50:59,046
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

708
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:00,505
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

709
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:03,175
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

710
00:51:03,175 --> 00:51:05,594
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

711
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:07,637
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

712
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:11,058
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.

713
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:13,560
Wow. Here.

714
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:16,313
Keep it.

715
00:51:17,648 --> 00:51:20,192
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

716
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:26,573
I like that kid.

717
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:28,825
He likes you.

718
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:37,292
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

719
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,130
I am heading off to Atlanta tonight
to see if I can get a partner

720
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,924
or raise money to get a new bot.

721
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:49,012
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?

722
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,519
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

723
00:52:04,028 --> 00:52:05,028
OK.

724
00:52:38,813 --> 00:52:40,105
Hey. Hey.

725
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:42,274
Look.

726
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:51,950
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

727
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,160
Yeah.

728
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:59,791
Zeus. No one has ever
gone two rounds with this monster.

729
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,126
Two rounds.

730
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:04,671
The champ puts his Real Steel world
championship belt on the line tonight.

731
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:06,798
He just may have a real fight
on his hands.

732
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:10,427
Zeus, greatest robot boxer
of all time. Ever.

733
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:12,220
End of story. Good night.

734
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:16,474
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

735
00:53:18,811 --> 00:53:19,811
Come on.

736
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:24,566
All right, listen up.
I got to go find Finn.

737
00:53:24,566 --> 00:53:27,527
- I want you to stay in this area, OK?
- OK.

738
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:30,488
Out of the way. Champ coming
through. Zeus coming through.

739
00:53:30,488 --> 00:53:32,032
Move, move.
Champ coming through.

740
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:47,631
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father-daughter Zeus team.

741
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:51,218
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

742
00:53:51,218 --> 00:53:53,345
You're very kind,

743
00:53:53,345 --> 00:53:55,430
but I assure you,
the mind behind Zeus

744
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,265
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

745
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:02,187
What did it take to lure the reclusive
genius, former boy wonder

746
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:04,189
and arguably the most
important bot designer

747
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:07,108
in the history of the sport
out of retirement?

748
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:10,362
Why don't you ask him yourself?

749
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:18,411
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

750
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,625
Zeus is autonomous and constantly
evolving during a fight.

751
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:27,837
With his adaptive operating system
he recognizes patterns

752
00:54:27,837 --> 00:54:32,175
and rewrites his fight code
instantaneously.

753
00:54:32,175 --> 00:54:35,679
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...

754
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:40,684
I am saying that no matter
what happens in that ring,

755
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:44,271
the result of any fight is inevitable.

756
00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:46,982
What Zeus sees...

757
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:49,818
...he kills.

758
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:52,946
Sweet.

759
00:55:21,743 --> 00:55:23,393
I am never
going into business with you.

760
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:25,312
I just need a break here,
Finn. Come on.

761
00:55:25,312 --> 00:55:27,105
You got that old bot truck out there.

762
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:29,024
- You always got something in there.
- I got an old G-2 sparring bot,

763
00:55:29,024 --> 00:55:32,152
ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?

764
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:35,238
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

765
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:36,990
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

766
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,868
I just need a little loan. Something...

767
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:41,661
What?

768
00:55:42,788 --> 00:55:44,456
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

769
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:47,709
Something. A couple hundred. Few
hundred. Whatever you got.

770
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:49,753
You know I am good for it.

771
00:55:49,753 --> 00:55:54,299
I know you,
and as much as I like you, dude...

772
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:56,217
...you're a bad bet, brother.

773
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:01,514
Right, yeah.

774
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:16,996
- Get back.
- All right. All right.

775
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:23,745
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

776
00:56:23,745 --> 00:56:25,830
Where you been?
I told you to stay put.

777
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,916
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing.

778
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,251
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

779
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:33,421
He was just peppering Axelrod
with punches, but so fast.

780
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:36,216
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.

781
00:56:36,216 --> 00:56:38,051
He didn't even survive the first round.

782
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:39,469
Is that what you think boxing is?

783
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:41,721
Zeus beating up some piece
of steel that they feed him?

784
00:56:41,721 --> 00:56:44,641
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

785
00:56:44,641 --> 00:56:47,394
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I am in it now.

786
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:50,355
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

787
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:53,942
He's more than that. And if you'd
just get us a fight, you'd see.

788
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:57,278
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

789
00:56:57,278 --> 00:56:58,947
Tomorrow afternoon,
you will get your fight.

790
00:56:58,947 --> 00:57:01,282
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

791
00:57:02,868 --> 00:57:05,036
I told you I hate hamburgers.

792
00:57:08,874 --> 00:57:10,041
It's a burrito.

793
00:57:18,843 --> 00:57:19,926
Right uppercut.

794
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:24,139
Left uppercut.

795
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:31,646
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

796
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:38,445
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

797
00:57:38,445 --> 00:57:41,948
- You been up all night?
- Yeah. I cleaned him up.

798
00:57:41,948 --> 00:57:44,033
I am using shadow mode
to program some fight moves

799
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:45,201
and sync them to the remote.

800
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:48,621
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

801
00:57:48,621 --> 00:57:50,915
That's... That's lethal stuff.

802
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:52,375
Let's do this.

803
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:55,503
Jeez. Let's do breakfast first.

804
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,751
You know you're
bringing him home in pieces, right?

805
00:58:37,004 --> 00:58:38,171
We will see.

806
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:47,764
Let me deal with this.

807
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:49,265
Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

808
00:58:49,265 --> 00:58:51,309
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

809
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:53,770
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

810
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,605
What's this, we on a field trip?

811
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:00,235
All right.
He can fight my robot Metro.

812
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:02,111
I will give you a 100 bucks
for one two-minute round.

813
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:03,530
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

814
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:08,076
One hundred. Baby boy, I am going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

815
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:09,911
How about 500 for two rounds?

816
00:59:10,537 --> 00:59:12,247
Two rounds.

817
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:14,582
Two rounds, son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

818
00:59:14,582 --> 00:59:17,252
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

819
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:19,921
Let's just say he does.

820
00:59:21,882 --> 00:59:25,134
If he's still
standing after one round...

821
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:30,213
...I will give you 1000 bucks. Shut it.
A 1000......

822
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,602
But if he dies in there,

823
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:36,437
which he will, junior...

824
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,692
...I get to keep what's left.

825
00:59:42,403 --> 00:59:43,695
Take the 100.

826
00:59:44,363 --> 00:59:46,155
Deal.

827
00:59:46,155 --> 00:59:48,992
We're on. We on.

828
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:53,621
Let's go.

829
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:54,747
You should have taken the 100.

830
00:59:54,747 --> 00:59:57,333
- I got us a thousand.
- Yeah, if he wins.

831
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,569
You want me to drive?

832
01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:26,279
He's my bot. I got this.

833
01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:29,615
This ain't a video game, kid.
This is for real. Right here.

834
01:00:29,615 --> 01:00:32,952
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

835
01:00:32,952 --> 01:00:34,287
All right.

836
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,373
I got this.

837
01:00:37,373 --> 01:00:39,751
Let's get it on.
Let's get it on.

838
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:43,588
Let's get it on
like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong.

839
01:00:43,588 --> 01:00:46,424
Give me a bell. Give me a bell.

840
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,730
Don't watch Atom.
Watch your opponent. Watch him.

841
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,232
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

842
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:07,195
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

843
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:10,656
Here comes the sledgehammer.

844
01:01:15,746 --> 01:01:17,747
Did you see that? Come on. Get him.
Don't yell at him, control him.

845
01:01:17,747 --> 01:01:20,249
Did you see that? Come on. Get him.
Don't yell at him, control him.

846
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:22,418
Slip right. Back step.

847
01:01:23,128 --> 01:01:25,338
Duck. You're welcome.

848
01:01:25,338 --> 01:01:27,799
- Shut up. You're not helping.
- Actually, I think I am.

849
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:29,258
No, no, no, no, no.

850
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:32,178
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.

851
01:01:32,178 --> 01:01:34,097
Just keep moving. Bob.

852
01:01:34,097 --> 01:01:35,306
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

853
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:42,772
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving. Bob and weave.

854
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:46,943
That's it. Now you're listening to me.

855
01:01:56,703 --> 01:02:00,206
He can take a hit. I will give you this,
kid. Your bot can take a hit.

856
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:05,294
You better slip that headlock because
this ain't going to end well for you.

857
01:02:05,294 --> 01:02:06,462
I am trying.

858
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:15,263
Thirty seconds.

859
01:02:16,723 --> 01:02:19,308
Thirty se... Half a minute.

860
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:22,103
Half a minute.
Keep moving. Just move.

861
01:02:25,357 --> 01:02:27,567
Come on, you have got 20 seconds.

862
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:30,987
That's a thousand bucks. Twenty
seconds. Let me... Let me take over.

863
01:02:30,987 --> 01:02:32,864
- No...
- Just move, then. Move.

864
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:41,247
Come on.

865
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,458
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

866
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:47,753
Count with me. Count with me.
One.

867
01:02:47,753 --> 01:02:48,880
Get up, Atom.

868
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,132
He can't hear you... You know you're
talking to a machine?

869
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:53,718
Four. Five. Six.

870
01:02:53,718 --> 01:02:55,428
Get up, Atom.

871
01:02:55,428 --> 01:02:57,847
All the way up. All the way up.

872
01:02:57,847 --> 01:03:00,433
- No.
- Yeah.

873
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:02,560
Yes. Yes.

874
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:08,816
I am going to fix it.
I am going to fix it.

875
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:12,778
I am going to fix it. Come on, now.

876
01:03:12,778 --> 01:03:14,572
- This 1,000 bucks...
- Yeah, 1,000.

877
01:03:14,572 --> 01:03:16,574
...double or nothing
he can't make another round.

878
01:03:16,574 --> 01:03:18,284
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

879
01:03:18,284 --> 01:03:20,661
Baby boy said it.
We're back on. We on.

880
01:03:20,661 --> 01:03:23,164
Are you crazy?
You threw away a 1,000 bucks.

881
01:03:23,164 --> 01:03:25,374
He can barely stand up in there.

882
01:03:25,374 --> 01:03:28,002
Look, I really need the money.

883
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:31,506
I know. Let's work.

884
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,258
Ah, Jesus.

885
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:41,974
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

886
01:03:48,022 --> 01:03:49,022
Huh?

887
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:51,442
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Yeah.

888
01:03:55,113 --> 01:03:58,366
- I got it.
- That's a system failure.

889
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,035
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

890
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:07,833
- Yes.
- No.

891
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:10,795
Start... Hey, hey. Start the count.

892
01:04:11,713 --> 01:04:12,797
Start the count.

893
01:04:12,797 --> 01:04:15,883
One. Two. Three.

894
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:20,638
Four. Five. Six. Seven.

895
01:04:20,638 --> 01:04:22,765
Eight. Nine.

896
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:24,433
Ten.

897
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,895
You did it. We did it. Wow.

898
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:33,526
Yeah.

899
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:36,279
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

900
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:40,866
I know, I know.
I know. I know.

901
01:04:40,866 --> 01:04:42,785
Kingpin, pay up.

902
01:04:42,785 --> 01:04:45,997
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

903
01:04:45,997 --> 01:04:49,750
- We owned.
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

904
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,669
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

905
01:04:51,669 --> 01:04:54,547
Saturday night.
Guaranteed four grand.

906
01:04:54,547 --> 01:04:56,048
Seven if he wins.

907
01:04:56,048 --> 01:04:58,342
Four grand?
You're on. Let's go.

908
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:11,606
Bailey, it's me. He won.

909
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:14,025
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

910
01:05:16,153 --> 01:05:17,236
I know.

911
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:22,033
Oh, yeah, oh, happy?
Oh, my God. Yeah.

912
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:24,619
He's been bit.
He's been bit real bad.

913
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:29,415
Yeah. Anyway, I...

914
01:05:31,752 --> 01:05:33,461
...I just wanted you to know.

915
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:05,284
Jab.

916
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,920
Jab, jab, hook.

917
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,173
I think you have to move your feet.

918
01:06:21,885 --> 01:06:25,985
- Your "feet." 
- "Feet."

919
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:46,969
Nice moves, kid.

920
01:07:49,222 --> 01:07:50,598
How long you been out here?

921
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,225
- Check it out.
- What?

922
01:07:53,225 --> 01:07:55,519
I just spent the night doing
something I think is amazing.

923
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,272
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

924
01:07:58,272 --> 01:08:00,608
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

925
01:08:00,608 --> 01:08:01,942
I killed it.

926
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:05,237
- Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore.
- How did you...

927
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:07,740
I had to start over.

928
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,493
But I was able
to use the spin frame from Ambush...

929
01:08:10,493 --> 01:08:14,288
...and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy and it works.

930
01:08:14,288 --> 01:08:17,666
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

931
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:18,918
What works?

932
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:21,670
I got to turn it on.

933
01:08:24,424 --> 01:08:25,925
Left jab, right uppercut.

934
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:29,178
Japan.

935
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:31,847
You put Noisy's voice
recognition into Atom?

936
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:35,601
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart? It could be genius.

937
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:38,312
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world.

938
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:40,397
Easy there, chief, easy. Whoa. Whoa.

939
01:08:40,397 --> 01:08:43,025
- Did you drink all these sodas?
- I might have had a few.

940
01:08:43,025 --> 01:08:46,028
- I need you to teach him to box.
- Are you kidding me?

941
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:48,906
He's nowhere near advanced enough
to handle Noisy's voice command.

942
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:51,075
So he needs your moves.
Your commands.

943
01:08:51,075 --> 01:08:53,828
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it, kid. Forget it.

944
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:57,498
You were a boxer, Charlie.
Yesterday at the Zoo,

945
01:08:57,498 --> 01:09:00,209
you could see things happen
before they even happened.

946
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:02,711
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I am not starting now.

947
01:09:02,711 --> 01:09:04,421
Who's going to teach him to fight?

948
01:09:04,421 --> 01:09:07,341
You're doing fine, Max.
You don't need me. Sorry.

949
01:09:11,763 --> 01:09:13,597
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

950
01:09:13,597 --> 01:09:16,725
You should do that on Saturday night.

951
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:19,770
- Don't make fun of me.
- I am serious.

952
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:22,565
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

953
01:09:22,565 --> 01:09:25,943
There's no way I am dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

954
01:09:25,943 --> 01:09:29,488
A box... Are you kidding me?
This is just a show.

955
01:09:29,488 --> 01:09:31,699
People want to see something
they have never seen.

956
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:34,577
Look. You think of all the greats.

957
01:09:34,577 --> 01:09:37,246
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

958
01:09:37,246 --> 01:09:39,331
they all had their nicknames.

959
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:42,501
They had their personas.
They all had flair.

960
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,920
Now you? You might
not have much robot,

961
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,131
but with that dance,
you got flair.

962
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:50,593
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

963
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:53,387
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I am 11. Okay.

964
01:09:53,387 --> 01:09:55,681
Are you sure you're 11?

965
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:58,601
Yes. I am sure I am 11.

966
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,022
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

967
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:08,527
You're really not messing with me?

968
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:11,071
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

969
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:15,492
- OK.
- Cool.

970
01:10:15,492 --> 01:10:16,911
- But...
- What?

971
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:19,580
I won't do it unless you help me.

972
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,042
I can't dance.
You're on your own there.

973
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:25,210
No. Boxing.

974
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,712
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

975
01:10:26,712 --> 01:10:29,048
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

976
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:30,549
And you dance.

977
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:34,094
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

978
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:35,344
Deal.

979
01:10:37,349 --> 01:10:38,432
Deal.

980
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:41,477
All right.

981
01:10:41,477 --> 01:10:42,978
It's going to be cool.

982
01:11:37,784 --> 01:11:38,867
Nice.

983
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:42,371
You're going
to be punching guys bigger.

984
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,498
You're going to have to punch up.

985
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:45,749
That's it.

986
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:47,835
Nice.

987
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,843
You, too, old man?

988
01:11:55,843 --> 01:11:57,886
Come on. Let's get to work.

989
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,725
Nice. Let's do that again.

990
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,562
Nice. Three-punch combo.

991
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:09,106
Combo.

992
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:11,859
Again. Again.

993
01:12:12,986 --> 01:12:16,405
Faster. Faster. Nice.

994
01:12:18,074 --> 01:12:20,743
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

995
01:12:20,743 --> 01:12:22,244
Let's see how you move.

996
01:12:28,084 --> 01:12:30,335
That's good.

997
01:13:06,122 --> 01:13:08,707
Step around.
Left hook. Left hook.

998
01:13:25,308 --> 01:13:26,975
That's it. Every time.

999
01:13:45,036 --> 01:13:46,370
Great fight, fellas.

1000
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:57,881
105.5, W-R-U-T,
the satellite home of robot boxing.

1001
01:13:57,881 --> 01:13:59,591
Caller two, what do you got for me?

1002
01:13:59,591 --> 01:14:02,136
Have you heard about this
little bot out there, his name is Atom?

1003
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:03,512
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1004
01:14:03,512 --> 01:14:05,889
My buddies and I saw him
the other night, and he dances.

1005
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:07,933
- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.

1006
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:09,852
He dances pre-fight
with this little kid,

1007
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:11,895
and the crowd
went nuts for these two.

1008
01:14:11,895 --> 01:14:13,313
I will tell you what's
really something,

1009
01:14:13,313 --> 01:14:14,731
you put the gimmick
aside for a second

1010
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:17,442
and I am holding here
a list of the bots he's beaten.

1011
01:14:17,442 --> 01:14:19,862
Chaos. Wall Street.
One-Eyed Jack.

1012
01:14:19,862 --> 01:14:21,780
No slouches on that list, right?

1013
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,116
But folks,
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

1014
01:14:24,116 --> 01:14:26,368
I am telling you, Tommy,
this bot is fast.

1015
01:14:26,368 --> 01:14:28,704
He escapes shots from
these bigger bots, it's insane.

1016
01:14:28,704 --> 01:14:30,455
No doubt, no doubt.
I am telling you, listeners,

1017
01:14:30,455 --> 01:14:33,876
you remember this name:
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.

1018
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:35,085
Atom.

1019
01:14:35,085 --> 01:14:36,920
This bot is one to watch.

1020
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:44,178
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

1021
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:46,346
Great fight, guys. Kenton, yeah.

1022
01:14:46,346 --> 01:14:47,848
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

1023
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:49,892
Good enough, we'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

1024
01:14:49,892 --> 01:14:51,852
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

1025
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:55,606
Right. Whoa.
That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

1026
01:14:55,606 --> 01:14:58,192
Damn right it is.
What do you say, fellas?

1027
01:14:58,192 --> 01:14:59,818
You ready for the show?

1028
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:02,696
Heck, yeah.

1029
01:15:11,497 --> 01:15:15,292
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

1030
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:18,503
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed, OK, Max.

1031
01:15:18,503 --> 01:15:20,047
No freaking out.

1032
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:21,590
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

1033
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:24,092
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

1034
01:15:24,092 --> 01:15:26,261
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.

1035
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:27,846
You got to have fun,
you understand me?

1036
01:15:27,846 --> 01:15:30,015
We have come too far to get out there

1037
01:15:30,015 --> 01:15:31,975
and freak out
and blow this whole thing.

1038
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:35,520
We're going to have fun, and we going to...
we're going to not freak out.

1039
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,066
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

1040
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:42,778
I tell you, man, I have spent my whole life
waiting to get here. We're going to...

1041
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:47,741
Because, I tell you what... Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

1042
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:50,410
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

1043
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:55,749
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

1044
01:15:55,749 --> 01:15:57,417
What was that? One more time.

1045
01:15:57,417 --> 01:16:00,003
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

1046
01:16:00,003 --> 01:16:04,383
Sure. Yeah. Let's head
up to the champ's suite. Sure.

1047
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:34,496
Wow.

1048
01:16:34,496 --> 01:16:36,456
Gentlemen, I am Farra Lemkova.

1049
01:16:36,456 --> 01:16:38,583
Yeah. I am Charlie Kenton and...

1050
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:40,711
And this, of course,
is Tak Mashido.

1051
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:44,047
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

1052
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:46,341
I know you have
a very important fight tonight,

1053
01:16:46,341 --> 01:16:47,634
so I will get right to it.

1054
01:16:47,634 --> 01:16:49,553
It's a little far
from the action for my liking.

1055
01:16:49,553 --> 01:16:53,098
It's nice. I like it, though.
Very nicely...

1056
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:55,183
Wow, that is... That's a great shot.

1057
01:16:55,183 --> 01:16:57,978
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...

1058
01:16:57,978 --> 01:16:59,604
I'd like to buy your robot.

1059
01:17:01,816 --> 01:17:03,984
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.

1060
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:06,153
And for that I am willing to pay.

1061
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:10,235
"Two hundred thousand dollars."

1062
01:17:10,366 --> 01:17:12,492
- Done. He's not for sale.
- What, no. Of course he is.

1063
01:17:12,492 --> 01:17:15,245
- We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

1064
01:17:15,245 --> 01:17:17,372
You are 15 minutes away

1065
01:17:17,372 --> 01:17:20,459
from getting in
the ring with Twin Cities,

1066
01:17:20,459 --> 01:17:22,377
a vicious League bot.

1067
01:17:22,377 --> 01:17:26,048
So, to be clear, my offer stands

1068
01:17:26,048 --> 01:17:27,799
until the starting bell.

1069
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:30,385
OK. And just to be clear,

1070
01:17:30,385 --> 01:17:32,179
he's not for sale.

1071
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,848
Not now, not ever.

1072
01:17:34,848 --> 01:17:37,809
Listen, give me
a minute to clear this up, OK?

1073
01:17:37,809 --> 01:17:40,812
Tak, how are you? Max.

1074
01:17:40,812 --> 01:17:45,567
Max. Max. Be smart.
I know you love him

1075
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:48,111
but in 20 minutes there
may be nothing left to love.

1076
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:50,447
Think about it.
Take the offer.

1077
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:52,908
You think about it.
Why does she want Atom?

1078
01:17:52,908 --> 01:17:55,619
Huh? Because he's
different from other bots.

1079
01:17:55,619 --> 01:17:57,412
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller and weaker,

1080
01:17:57,412 --> 01:17:58,663
and he's going
to get his ass kicked.

1081
01:17:58,663 --> 01:18:03,251
He's a boxer. We taught him to box.
You taught him to box.

1082
01:18:03,251 --> 01:18:05,379
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

1083
01:18:05,379 --> 01:18:08,799
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

1084
01:18:08,799 --> 01:18:11,885
Charlie, we can go round and round
this all night long.

1085
01:18:11,885 --> 01:18:13,512
Look at me, look at me.

1086
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:16,139
But it's not going to happen.

1087
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,725
I got a fight to get to.

1088
01:18:33,324 --> 01:18:36,993
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight

1089
01:18:36,993 --> 01:18:41,873
the march towards
the Real Steel Championship

1090
01:18:41,873 --> 01:18:45,460
makes its way through Detroit's

1091
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:49,089
Virgin America Spectrum.

1092
01:18:53,302 --> 01:18:57,722
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

1093
01:18:57,722 --> 01:19:00,642
the two-headed tyrant,

1094
01:19:00,642 --> 01:19:06,082
"Twin.......... Cities."

1095
01:19:35,428 --> 01:19:40,849
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

1096
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:44,352
hailing from parts unknown...

1097
01:19:44,352 --> 01:19:46,354
...Atom.

1098
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:43,203
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

1099
01:20:43,203 --> 01:20:45,622
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

1100
01:20:45,622 --> 01:20:47,457
All right, now this bot
is tough to put down.

1101
01:20:47,457 --> 01:20:48,583
Atom can do it.

1102
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:53,004
Max, look over there. You see those
geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

1103
01:20:53,004 --> 01:20:54,422
They're controlling everything
their bot does.

1104
01:20:54,422 --> 01:20:56,508
They're monitoring his systems,
seeing what he sees,

1105
01:20:56,508 --> 01:20:58,093
stadium feeds of the fights, everything.

1106
01:20:58,093 --> 01:21:00,262
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

1107
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:02,639
we have been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

1108
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,349
So what do we do?

1109
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:08,603
We fight smart,
we be patient. And pray.

1110
01:21:10,106 --> 01:21:11,856
Seriously, pray.

1111
01:21:13,442 --> 01:21:15,151
Ready.

1112
01:21:16,696 --> 01:21:18,488
- Ready.
- Hands up.

1113
01:21:18,488 --> 01:21:20,907
Fighters ready. Fight.

1114
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:26,663
Engage.

1115
01:21:26,663 --> 01:21:28,415
Slip. Right.

1116
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:30,917
Lean back. Right, left.

1117
01:21:30,917 --> 01:21:32,294
Cover up.

1118
01:21:35,464 --> 01:21:37,298
Duck. Left roundhouse.

1119
01:21:39,552 --> 01:21:40,552
Damn it.

1120
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,270
Lean left. Lean right.

1121
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:51,980
Cover up. Cover up.

1122
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,148
What's going on in there?

1123
01:21:53,148 --> 01:21:55,150
Too many hits.
He's taking too many hits.

1124
01:22:01,032 --> 01:22:02,324
Get your hands up.

1125
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:06,995
Get out of that corner. Move.

1126
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:12,584
Come on, Charlie. He's getting killed
in there. Tell him what to do.

1127
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:15,462
That guy's got two heads, and about a
foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1128
01:22:15,462 --> 01:22:17,422
He's got to have a weakness. Find it.

1129
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:24,679
Wait, wait, wait.

1130
01:22:25,389 --> 01:22:28,141
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder. He's got a tell.

1131
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:30,810
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb.

1132
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:33,104
- So?
- We got him. See? Here it comes again.

1133
01:22:33,104 --> 01:22:35,940
Duck. Spin. Slide left.
Roundhouse. One, two.

1134
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:39,361
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

1135
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:41,529
Come on, Charlie. Get in there.

1136
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:44,157
Got to get in close where he can't use
that size and reach on us.

1137
01:22:44,157 --> 01:22:47,494
Left to the body. Right to the body.
Left to the body.

1138
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:48,995
Yeah, it's working.

1139
01:22:48,995 --> 01:22:51,081
Stay downstairs. Left, right, left.

1140
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:53,833
These program modes aren't working.

1141
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:55,251
Left. Right hook, slip.

1142
01:22:55,251 --> 01:22:57,295
Right uppercut. Left uppercut.

1143
01:22:57,295 --> 01:22:59,089
Duck left. Counter right.

1144
01:22:59,089 --> 01:23:01,800
- Get him, Atom.
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

1145
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,969
Three-punch combo
to the body. Out. In. Counter.

1146
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:07,013
- Two-one-two.
- Two-one-two.

1147
01:23:07,013 --> 01:23:08,598
Stay on him. Lunging right.

1148
01:23:10,393 --> 01:23:11,393
No.

1149
01:23:11,393 --> 01:23:14,062
Don't let him go. Right to the body.
Straight right to the head.

1150
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:22,153
- That's it, we got a systems crash.
- Get him, Atom.

1151
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:25,365
Damn it.

1152
01:23:25,365 --> 01:23:26,741
This is not happening.
This is not happening, man.

1153
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:29,285
- Put him away, Charlie.
- Spin left.

1154
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:31,621
Spin right.

1155
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:35,750
- Finish him.
- Do it.

1156
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,085
Right uppercut.

1157
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:40,964
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1158
01:23:40,964 --> 01:23:43,007
Yeah.

1159
01:23:43,007 --> 01:23:45,847
- "Ah." 
- "Ah."

1160
01:23:47,388 --> 01:23:48,471
He's down.

1161
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,684
One. Two. Three.

1162
01:23:52,684 --> 01:23:55,353
Four. Five.

1163
01:23:55,353 --> 01:23:59,066
- Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
- We got him. Stay down.

1164
01:23:59,066 --> 01:24:01,693
He's out. He's out.

1165
01:24:01,693 --> 01:24:03,987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1166
01:24:07,783 --> 01:24:08,825
Yeah.

1167
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:13,621
Corner.

1168
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:16,750
Corner. Corner.

1169
01:24:18,377 --> 01:24:20,754
Victory.

1170
01:24:20,754 --> 01:24:25,133
In a time
of one minute, 47 seconds

1171
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:29,987
of the first round,
Atom has defeat...

1172
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:33,308
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight.

1173
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:40,106
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

1174
01:24:40,106 --> 01:24:41,608
How about that?

1175
01:24:42,902 --> 01:24:47,447
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

1176
01:24:47,447 --> 01:24:50,575
Farra Lemkova.

1177
01:24:53,245 --> 01:24:54,204
Whoa, OK, hang on.

1178
01:24:54,204 --> 01:24:55,789
That instead of buying my robot,

1179
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:57,540
and using your
money to control this sport...

1180
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,417
- That's it.
- Wait, I am not done.

1181
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:02,670
Why not give
the littlest guy the biggest shot?

1182
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:06,633
Seriously, because I bet if you give him
a shot, he will surprise you.

1183
01:25:06,633 --> 01:25:08,718
Wouldn't you
like to see a little guy get a shot

1184
01:25:08,718 --> 01:25:12,847
at the Real Steel Championship?

1185
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,144
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1186
01:25:19,772 --> 01:25:24,150
Any time, any place, anywhere.

1187
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,653
You name it. We will be there.

1188
01:25:26,653 --> 01:25:28,571
Yeah. OK.

1189
01:25:35,037 --> 01:25:36,955
I am going to get us that fight.

1190
01:25:41,752 --> 01:25:43,878
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1191
01:25:56,809 --> 01:25:59,060
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1192
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:00,728
That's one thing to call it.

1193
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:02,397
I think a lot of people would
like to see that fight.

1194
01:26:02,397 --> 01:26:05,275
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez.

1195
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:07,151
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1196
01:26:07,151 --> 01:26:09,070
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1197
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:12,407
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1198
01:26:12,407 --> 01:26:14,534
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1199
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:16,911
I told you
we shouldn't have sold him.

1200
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:20,290
OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right?

1201
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:22,709
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1202
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:24,794
All right, all right. All right.

1203
01:26:24,794 --> 01:26:28,400
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1204
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,092
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1205
01:26:33,053 --> 01:26:35,013
- Whoo. All right, we set?
- Yeah.

1206
01:26:35,013 --> 01:26:38,182
- All right, let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

1207
01:26:38,182 --> 01:26:41,644
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

1208
01:26:41,644 --> 01:26:44,647
I actually really
was going to call you.

1209
01:26:44,647 --> 01:26:46,441
Don't worry about that.

1210
01:26:46,441 --> 01:26:48,526
That was a heck of a fight.

1211
01:26:48,526 --> 01:26:51,070
Congratulations to both of you.
That was really good.

1212
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:54,198
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

1213
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,534
- Come on, man.
- What?

1214
01:26:56,534 --> 01:27:00,747
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1215
01:27:00,747 --> 01:27:02,582
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1216
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:05,835
He thought that was a joke.
How about that? It wasn't a joke.

1217
01:27:05,835 --> 01:27:10,173
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

1218
01:27:10,173 --> 01:27:12,967
I am sure you do, Charlie, but...

1219
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:16,137
...but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

1220
01:27:16,137 --> 01:27:18,431
All right. What do you want?

1221
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:21,601
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1222
01:27:21,601 --> 01:27:23,311
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

1223
01:27:23,311 --> 01:27:26,606
Let's go. Max, go. Go, go. Run.

1224
01:27:26,606 --> 01:27:30,109
- Run. Come on. Keep up.
- Get him now.

1225
01:27:30,109 --> 01:27:32,999
Run. Come on. Charlie.

1226
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:35,198
Get off him. Get off him.

1227
01:27:38,535 --> 01:27:39,535
Come here.

1228
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:45,083
Hey, Ricky.

1229
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,751
That's his money. Leave him out of this.

1230
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:49,796
Hey.

1231
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:00,390
Stop.

1232
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,769
Stop.

1233
01:28:04,769 --> 01:28:08,564
Take all his money. Take it all.

1234
01:28:11,193 --> 01:28:13,528
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1235
01:28:13,528 --> 01:28:15,363
He's my father.

1236
01:28:17,574 --> 01:28:22,203
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

1237
01:28:22,203 --> 01:28:25,289
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1238
01:28:28,544 --> 01:28:30,712
Whoo.

1239
01:28:30,712 --> 01:28:33,715
Just like old times, Charlie boy.

1240
01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:35,216
Let's go, boys.

1241
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:41,973
Charlie.

1242
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:05,329
I am sorry, Max.
I am sorry. Sorry.

1243
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,330
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

1244
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:49,791
Is it Farra?
She called you, didn't she?

1245
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:52,460
- We're going to get the Zeus fight.
- Listen, it's not the Zeus people.

1246
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:55,755
I have been thinking about
all this, and...

1247
01:29:56,882 --> 01:29:57,882
Max.

1248
01:29:58,842 --> 01:30:00,593
Max?

1249
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:05,306
Max.

1250
01:30:07,559 --> 01:30:10,019
It's so good to see you.

1251
01:30:10,019 --> 01:30:12,271
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

1252
01:30:12,271 --> 01:30:14,899
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

1253
01:30:14,899 --> 01:30:16,776
He's been beat up.
I told you he couldn't take care of him.

1254
01:30:16,776 --> 01:30:19,487
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

1255
01:30:19,487 --> 01:30:21,697
We're fine. She can leave.

1256
01:30:21,697 --> 01:30:24,867
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

1257
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:27,411
Charlie, please.

1258
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,580
Just...

1259
01:30:32,584 --> 01:30:35,128
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1260
01:30:37,089 --> 01:30:39,006
Charlie, please, no.

1261
01:30:40,259 --> 01:30:43,344
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1262
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:46,889
Please. Please.

1263
01:30:51,478 --> 01:30:54,522
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

1264
01:30:55,357 --> 01:30:57,942
I know you think you know what's right,
but you don't.

1265
01:30:57,942 --> 01:30:59,944
You're too young.
You don't know.

1266
01:30:59,944 --> 01:31:01,529
Look at me, trust me.

1267
01:31:01,529 --> 01:31:05,074
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

1268
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,827
You tell me, what can I do?

1269
01:31:12,499 --> 01:31:14,250
Max.

1270
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,678
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1271
01:31:25,678 --> 01:31:27,930
Max, we have our
own swimming pool

1272
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:32,852
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

1273
01:31:32,852 --> 01:31:35,521
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

1274
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,899
What's going on?

1275
01:31:37,899 --> 01:31:41,485
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

1276
01:31:41,485 --> 01:31:43,237
I am going to wait in the car.

1277
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:48,326
You don't want to talk, fine. I will talk.

1278
01:31:48,326 --> 01:31:50,369
What do you want me to say? I am sorry?

1279
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:55,583
You knew from day one what this was.
You decided to take the ride.

1280
01:31:56,251 --> 01:32:00,379
I mean, what? Max, you thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

1281
01:32:00,379 --> 01:32:03,716
were going to
ride off into the sunset? Come on.

1282
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:07,178
No, you forgot who I was.

1283
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:14,727
You deserve better...

1284
01:32:16,188 --> 01:32:17,355
...than me.

1285
01:32:21,485 --> 01:32:23,527
Will you say something, please?

1286
01:32:23,527 --> 01:32:26,155
I tried, OK. What do you want from me?

1287
01:32:26,155 --> 01:32:28,032
I want you to fight for me.

1288
01:32:29,284 --> 01:32:31,077
That's all I ever wanted.

1289
01:34:36,453 --> 01:34:37,787
No, don't ask.

1290
01:34:39,289 --> 01:34:41,499
So no Max.

1291
01:34:42,751 --> 01:34:46,378
It's better this way. Marv and Debra
have money. Max is set.

1292
01:34:46,378 --> 01:34:49,465
Did you not see
the way he looked at you?

1293
01:34:49,465 --> 01:34:51,759
Charlie, that's the way
I looked at my dad.

1294
01:34:51,759 --> 01:34:54,303
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1295
01:34:54,303 --> 01:34:59,225
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1296
01:34:59,225 --> 01:35:00,976
Me, come on. I blew it.

1297
01:35:02,979 --> 01:35:04,438
I blew it.

1298
01:35:05,565 --> 01:35:07,191
When Max was born I just...

1299
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:09,193
...freaked out.

1300
01:35:09,193 --> 01:35:11,612
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1301
01:35:11,612 --> 01:35:12,905
I just wouldn't know where to start.

1302
01:35:12,905 --> 01:35:14,240
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1303
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,741
- You do.
- No.

1304
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:17,868
You do.

1305
01:35:50,861 --> 01:35:52,069
I got to go.

1306
01:35:55,031 --> 01:35:56,699
Twelve-hundred miles for a kiss.

1307
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:00,494
Worth it. Worth it.

1308
01:36:11,798 --> 01:36:13,507
Go get him, Charlie.

1309
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:18,304
You sound like your dad.

1310
01:36:40,452 --> 01:36:41,452
Hey.

1311
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:50,419
OK. Uh, look,
I know you think I abandoned you

1312
01:36:50,419 --> 01:36:53,422
and I guess I did originally.

1313
01:36:53,422 --> 01:36:56,342
- Then you sold me.
- Charlie.

1314
01:36:56,342 --> 01:36:59,386
- Hey.
- You have no business being here.

1315
01:36:59,386 --> 01:37:01,972
That's true.
You have got full custody. He's yours.

1316
01:37:01,972 --> 01:37:04,600
And I know I have done
all kinds of wrong by this kid,

1317
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,936
but if you will let me...

1318
01:37:08,188 --> 01:37:10,314
...I'd just like to
do one thing right.

1319
01:37:13,151 --> 01:37:14,235
Right.

1320
01:37:15,862 --> 01:37:17,613
- Now, where were we?
- You sold me.

1321
01:37:17,613 --> 01:37:21,075
- Right, yeah, that happened.
- Wait, what?

1322
01:37:21,075 --> 01:37:23,911
- Then we had our asses kicked.
- And you slept on a shelf in a truck,

1323
01:37:23,911 --> 01:37:25,371
- and it was awful.
- And dangerous.

1324
01:37:25,405 --> 01:37:30,459
Really dangerous. I mean, I know.
God. I am sorry.

1325
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:34,421
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1326
01:37:34,421 --> 01:37:36,924
No. I mean yes. Yes.

1327
01:37:39,844 --> 01:37:41,345
But no.

1328
01:37:41,345 --> 01:37:44,348
No, I came to
tell you that I heard you.

1329
01:37:44,348 --> 01:37:48,727
I got it.
I am a little slow, but I got it.

1330
01:37:48,727 --> 01:37:53,023
I know you had a bum ride, Max, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1331
01:37:54,234 --> 01:37:55,442
I should have been.

1332
01:37:56,569 --> 01:37:58,946
Your mom was...

1333
01:37:58,946 --> 01:38:00,364
She was cool, wasn't she?

1334
01:38:01,908 --> 01:38:03,534
She was.

1335
01:38:03,534 --> 01:38:05,744
She was the coolest.

1336
01:38:05,744 --> 01:38:08,455
Yeah, she was.

1337
01:38:11,626 --> 01:38:13,627
And I am sorry about......

1338
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:17,548
.....about what happened with her.

1339
01:38:19,634 --> 01:38:24,179
And I can't get those years back,
Max, but...

1340
01:38:24,179 --> 01:38:26,974
...but I am here right now...

1341
01:38:26,974 --> 01:38:30,728
...and if you're up for it,
I am ready to fight.

1342
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:46,201
We got the Zeus fight.

1343
01:38:46,578 --> 01:38:47,578
What?

1344
01:38:48,163 --> 01:38:50,164
No, no, we didn't.

1345
01:38:50,164 --> 01:38:52,958
You got the Zeus fight.

1346
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:59,715
So what do you say, Debra?
Can we do this one last thing?

1347
01:39:03,219 --> 01:39:04,386
One night.

1348
01:39:04,386 --> 01:39:06,013
One night.
It's all we need. Thank you.

1349
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:14,730
We will probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we will go down swinging.

1350
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:16,106
Yeah?

1351
01:39:16,106 --> 01:39:17,941
What do you say?

1352
01:39:19,903 --> 01:39:21,987
Welcome, everyone,
to New York's Bing Arena

1353
01:39:21,987 --> 01:39:24,448
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1354
01:39:24,448 --> 01:39:26,950
Well, Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.

1355
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:29,328
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion

1356
01:39:29,328 --> 01:39:32,790
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1357
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:34,875
The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight

1358
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:37,503
outside the circle
of well-known League bots

1359
01:39:37,503 --> 01:39:41,673
and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1360
01:39:41,673 --> 01:39:45,344
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1361
01:39:45,344 --> 01:39:48,097
The greatest robot boxer of all time
gives a shot at the belt

1362
01:39:48,097 --> 01:39:50,307
to a G-2 named Atom?

1363
01:39:50,307 --> 01:39:54,228
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1364
01:39:54,228 --> 01:39:56,647
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena

1365
01:39:56,647 --> 01:39:59,817
but he has made no bones about
his disdain for this matchup.

1366
01:39:59,817 --> 01:40:02,778
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1367
01:40:02,778 --> 01:40:05,697
Take a look at this clip. Mashido
wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

1368
01:40:05,697 --> 01:40:09,326
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.

1369
01:40:09,326 --> 01:40:11,578
Now, in truth, Herb, Max Kenton,
Atom's trainer,

1370
01:40:11,578 --> 01:40:13,163
did more
than just challenge Zeus.

1371
01:40:13,163 --> 01:40:14,748
He did so publicly.

1372
01:40:14,748 --> 01:40:18,335
The challenge went viral and
created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1373
01:40:18,335 --> 01:40:20,712
No argument there, Tim.
And I think the Zeus camp

1374
01:40:20,712 --> 01:40:23,841
- knows exactly what they're doing.
- That they do. I mean, come on.

1375
01:40:23,841 --> 01:40:26,927
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1376
01:40:26,927 --> 01:40:30,264
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1377
01:40:30,264 --> 01:40:33,100
And, hey, judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1378
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:49,116
We can't win, can we?

1379
01:40:50,201 --> 01:40:51,285
We will see.

1380
01:40:55,373 --> 01:40:57,749
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1381
01:40:57,749 --> 01:40:59,877
you can hear
the surge of excitement, Herb.

1382
01:41:11,306 --> 01:41:14,933
Atom has arrived onto
the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1383
01:41:14,933 --> 01:41:17,811
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1384
01:41:17,811 --> 01:41:20,397
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1385
01:41:20,397 --> 01:41:22,816
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1386
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:25,819
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face
says it all.

1387
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:27,779
Welcome to the bigs, junior.

1388
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:30,908
I am giving 1-to-5 odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1389
01:41:30,908 --> 01:41:33,076
Now who wants some?

1390
01:41:33,076 --> 01:41:34,578
I will take some of that action.

1391
01:41:34,578 --> 01:41:38,916
Hey, there.
I will take some of that action.

1392
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:42,211
How's it going... partner?

1393
01:41:42,211 --> 01:41:44,338
Partner?

1394
01:41:44,338 --> 01:41:47,424
That's great. How about a
100K deep? Is that funny?

1395
01:41:47,424 --> 01:41:50,427
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1396
01:41:50,427 --> 01:41:52,346
You carrying
around that kind of scratch?

1397
01:41:53,515 --> 01:41:55,766
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1398
01:41:56,601 --> 01:42:00,562
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C

1399
01:42:00,562 --> 01:42:03,649
and you can bring me my money
right to my seat.

1400
01:42:03,649 --> 01:42:06,985
101, row C? Hundred K?

1401
01:42:07,987 --> 01:42:09,029
You heard me, homey.

1402
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:10,948
- Homey?
- Right?

1403
01:42:10,948 --> 01:42:12,324
Homeboy.

1404
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:16,203
All right. Peace out, posse.

1405
01:42:16,203 --> 01:42:17,579
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1406
01:42:41,521 --> 01:42:43,021
Never beaten.

1407
01:42:43,021 --> 01:42:44,147
It's showtime.

1408
01:42:44,147 --> 01:42:46,525
Never threatened.

1409
01:42:46,525 --> 01:42:49,570
The king of the ring,

1410
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:52,948
the ruler of robots.

1411
01:42:52,948 --> 01:42:58,412
Bow down to the mighty Zeus.

1412
01:43:24,022 --> 01:43:25,230
Oh, shit.

1413
01:43:31,779 --> 01:43:32,946
That was awesome.

1414
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:40,787
Come on, let's go.

1415
01:43:47,211 --> 01:43:50,339
Ladies and gentlemen,

1416
01:43:50,339 --> 01:43:53,383
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1417
01:43:53,383 --> 01:43:56,345
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

1418
01:43:56,345 --> 01:44:00,390
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom.

1419
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,642
Showboat.

1420
01:44:06,397 --> 01:44:08,774
And in the corner to my left,

1421
01:44:08,774 --> 01:44:12,069
the undeniable champion
of this universe

1422
01:44:12,069 --> 01:44:15,530
and any other universe
known or unknown,

1423
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:19,330
the..... mighty.... Zeus.

1424
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:27,209
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1425
01:44:27,209 --> 01:44:28,710
are you ready

1426
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:34,510
for........ Real........ Steel.

1427
01:44:36,803 --> 01:44:37,969
This is what it's all about.

1428
01:44:37,969 --> 01:44:42,224
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

1429
01:44:42,224 --> 01:44:45,018
The bots
emerge from their corners.

1430
01:44:45,018 --> 01:44:48,063
Zeus decks Atom,
and he is already down.

1431
01:44:48,063 --> 01:44:50,315
On your feet. Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1432
01:44:50,315 --> 01:44:53,527
On your feet. Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1433
01:44:54,779 --> 01:44:57,072
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

1434
01:44:58,074 --> 01:44:59,116
Get up.

1435
01:44:59,116 --> 01:45:00,492
...two, three...

1436
01:45:00,492 --> 01:45:04,204
Push up. Stand up.

1437
01:45:04,204 --> 01:45:07,040
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1438
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,293
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus.

1439
01:45:10,293 --> 01:45:12,796
And Atom is down for the second
time in less than ten seconds.

1440
01:45:12,796 --> 01:45:16,425
- He's too strong. He's too strong.
- That's my boy right there.

1441
01:45:17,428 --> 01:45:19,970
Get up. Get up and get in the game.

1442
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:23,140
Come on.
No, please Atom, get up. Please.

1443
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:26,659
Get up. Get up. Get up.

1444
01:45:27,228 --> 01:45:30,188
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet.

1445
01:45:31,607 --> 01:45:32,941
Lean back. Lean back.

1446
01:45:32,941 --> 01:45:35,068
Atom's getting pummeled
into the corner.

1447
01:45:35,068 --> 01:45:37,487
- Get out of there, Atom.
- Move, Atom, move.

1448
01:45:39,782 --> 01:45:41,825
A demolishing inside shot.

1449
01:45:41,825 --> 01:45:43,201
Get your hands up.

1450
01:45:45,204 --> 01:45:46,788
Hands up.

1451
01:45:47,582 --> 01:45:49,082
Crush that little can.

1452
01:45:49,082 --> 01:45:50,584
Get out of the corner.
Get out of the corner.

1453
01:45:50,584 --> 01:45:52,919
Charlie Kenton desperately
trying to command his robot

1454
01:45:52,919 --> 01:45:54,045
out of that suicide corner.

1455
01:45:54,045 --> 01:45:55,547
Cover up.

1456
01:45:58,426 --> 01:46:00,177
Get your feet under you.

1457
01:46:01,763 --> 01:46:03,764
Good night, sparring bot.

1458
01:46:03,764 --> 01:46:06,475
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again.

1459
01:46:06,475 --> 01:46:10,061
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1460
01:46:10,061 --> 01:46:12,397
- Stand up.
- Two.

1461
01:46:12,397 --> 01:46:15,358
- Three.
- Come on, Atom, get up.

1462
01:46:15,358 --> 01:46:17,694
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1463
01:46:17,694 --> 01:46:21,031
- Six. Seven.
- Get up.

1464
01:46:21,031 --> 01:46:23,742
Eight. Nine.

1465
01:46:23,742 --> 01:46:26,620
I don't believe this.
Against all odds,

1466
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:28,622
this little bot is on his feet again.

1467
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:30,832
Come on, Atom.

1468
01:46:34,045 --> 01:46:35,212
He can't survive this.

1469
01:46:39,008 --> 01:46:41,259
- Come on, Charlie.
- Right uppercut.

1470
01:46:42,553 --> 01:46:45,305
Atom has landed a punch.

1471
01:46:45,305 --> 01:46:48,141
Zeus is stunned as he reels back
from an uppercut

1472
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:51,311
- that he clearly never saw coming.
- Advance.

1473
01:46:52,188 --> 01:46:56,233
Fade back, counter right.

1474
01:46:56,233 --> 01:46:58,693
Right cross. Right cross.

1475
01:46:58,693 --> 01:46:59,611
Right cross.

1476
01:46:59,946 --> 01:47:00,737
Left hook.

1477
01:47:00,737 --> 01:47:03,782
- Let's go. Come on.
- Take him down.

1478
01:47:03,782 --> 01:47:04,824
Double right to the body.

1479
01:47:04,824 --> 01:47:06,701
For the first time
in his dominant run,

1480
01:47:06,701 --> 01:47:10,999
Zeus has met a bot who simply
won't back down.

1481
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:15,085
The crowd is going nuts.
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1482
01:47:15,085 --> 01:47:18,004
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one.

1483
01:47:18,004 --> 01:47:22,342
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists.

1484
01:47:22,342 --> 01:47:25,428
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down.

1485
01:47:25,428 --> 01:47:29,240
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low.

1486
01:47:32,311 --> 01:47:35,522
Only five seconds left,
as here comes that monster

1487
01:47:35,522 --> 01:47:37,974
piston-packed right of the champ.

1488
01:47:38,776 --> 01:47:42,862
There's the bell. I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1489
01:47:42,862 --> 01:47:45,615
- He made it.
- We will have a second round.

1490
01:47:45,615 --> 01:47:48,243
And the crowd here is thrilled.

1491
01:47:51,372 --> 01:47:53,290
He made it. Yeah. Corner.

1492
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:56,001
He made it. Yeah. Corner.

1493
01:47:56,001 --> 01:47:57,711
We got to get out of here,
darling, come on.

1494
01:47:57,711 --> 01:47:59,921
We got to get out of here right now.

1495
01:48:02,675 --> 01:48:05,051
We got to go this way.
Come on.

1496
01:48:10,558 --> 01:48:11,891
OK, you sit down.

1497
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:17,647
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1498
01:48:17,647 --> 01:48:19,441
I will be back for you, baby.

1499
01:48:20,568 --> 01:48:22,485
Get your hands off me.

1500
01:48:25,364 --> 01:48:27,907
Both corners furiously
working on their bots.

1501
01:48:27,907 --> 01:48:31,286
I tell you, Tim, this crowd came here
tonight expecting a massacre

1502
01:48:31,286 --> 01:48:33,580
but instead they're getting a war.

1503
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:35,123
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1504
01:48:35,123 --> 01:48:38,543
- All right. Here we go.
- What is happening?

1505
01:48:38,543 --> 01:48:41,921
He is fully prepared
for all possible contingencies.

1506
01:48:41,921 --> 01:48:45,175
- He will be fine.
- What next?

1507
01:48:46,093 --> 01:48:47,427
Round two.

1508
01:48:55,019 --> 01:48:57,228
Round two kicks off,

1509
01:48:57,228 --> 01:49:01,775
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1510
01:49:02,818 --> 01:49:06,929
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can.

1511
01:49:10,284 --> 01:49:12,535
Kenton working his bot
with a trifecta

1512
01:49:12,535 --> 01:49:15,246
of straight rights
to the champ's dome.

1513
01:49:20,336 --> 01:49:24,339
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows.

1514
01:49:27,426 --> 01:49:31,096
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed.

1515
01:49:33,933 --> 01:49:37,352
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1516
01:49:37,352 --> 01:49:40,355
This is a brawl.

1517
01:49:42,483 --> 01:49:43,983
The crowd is on their feet,

1518
01:49:43,983 --> 01:49:47,070
watching two machines
driven to kill each other.

1519
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:50,115
Something has to give, and it does.

1520
01:49:50,115 --> 01:49:52,033
Atom goes down again.

1521
01:49:52,033 --> 01:49:54,202
Lights out for the junkyard dog

1522
01:49:54,202 --> 01:49:56,329
who put on a heck
of a show here tonight.

1523
01:49:58,499 --> 01:50:01,042
And yet again,
Atom rises up.

1524
01:50:01,042 --> 01:50:05,672
Kenton must have hardwired this bot
with the will to go on.

1525
01:50:12,138 --> 01:50:17,016
Midway through round four, and Zeus is
looking to end this thing right now.

1526
01:50:17,016 --> 01:50:18,893
The champ
is holding nothing back

1527
01:50:18,893 --> 01:50:21,104
as he cracks open the hurt locker.

1528
01:50:31,824 --> 01:50:33,575
Atom is
stumbling around the ring,

1529
01:50:33,575 --> 01:50:35,535
apparently disoriented and dazed.

1530
01:50:35,535 --> 01:50:37,203
- Hands up.
- What's going on?

1531
01:50:37,203 --> 01:50:38,747
I think the voice recog is shot.

1532
01:50:38,747 --> 01:50:40,081
- He's not responding.
- What?

1533
01:50:43,419 --> 01:50:46,129
Zeus has found
yet another gear of violence,

1534
01:50:46,129 --> 01:50:48,214
drilling Atom's midsection.

1535
01:50:48,214 --> 01:50:52,635
- No. Stop. Do something.
- He can't hear me.

1536
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:56,264
But the bell sounds,
and once again,

1537
01:50:56,264 --> 01:50:59,100
this little robot
has stunned the world.

1538
01:51:01,437 --> 01:51:04,105
We're done, Max.
He can't hear me.

1539
01:51:04,105 --> 01:51:06,399
This is murder.
We have had enough.

1540
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:08,943
- I am disabling the voice recognition.
- So what? He can't hear me.

1541
01:51:08,943 --> 01:51:12,865
- Yes, but he can see you.
- What? What is going on?

1542
01:51:12,865 --> 01:51:15,575
I am putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1543
01:51:15,575 --> 01:51:18,203
Without the voice recognition,
he will move even faster.

1544
01:51:18,203 --> 01:51:22,332
- No way. No way.
- Look at them. They are freaking out.

1545
01:51:22,332 --> 01:51:24,334
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there.

1546
01:51:24,334 --> 01:51:26,586
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1547
01:51:26,586 --> 01:51:28,922
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1548
01:51:28,922 --> 01:51:30,799
- But I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

1549
01:51:30,799 --> 01:51:34,177
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1550
01:51:34,887 --> 01:51:38,431
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1551
01:51:38,431 --> 01:51:43,019
- Don't ask me. Don't.
- Charlie... please.

1552
01:51:43,813 --> 01:51:45,480
I beg you.

1553
01:51:53,489 --> 01:51:54,948
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1554
01:51:56,784 --> 01:52:00,078
- Damn it.
- Yes.

1555
01:52:00,078 --> 01:52:02,664
I can't believe I am doing this.

1556
01:52:02,664 --> 01:52:05,333
I know you're in there. I am not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1557
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:06,751
but I know you're in there.

1558
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:09,770
- Come on, Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1559
01:52:11,416 --> 01:52:17,512
Hey, I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me.

1560
01:52:17,888 --> 01:52:20,098
Watch... me.

1561
01:52:20,098 --> 01:52:23,810
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1562
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,688
Watch me.

1563
01:52:26,688 --> 01:52:28,940
An epic battle
being waged here tonight,

1564
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:31,234
as the fifth
and final round gets underway.

1565
01:52:31,234 --> 01:52:33,069
Come on, Atom.

1566
01:52:42,705 --> 01:52:44,956
Wait a second, Herb.
Are you seeing this?

1567
01:52:44,956 --> 01:52:48,209
Charlie Kenton
is shadowboxing just outside the ring.

1568
01:52:48,209 --> 01:52:50,628
Tim, it looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1569
01:52:50,628 --> 01:52:53,423
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1570
01:52:53,423 --> 01:52:56,551
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1571
01:52:56,551 --> 01:52:58,928
Well, I tell you what, it doesn't
seem to be much help,

1572
01:52:58,928 --> 01:53:01,680
because Atom is backed up
against the ropes again.

1573
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,934
Oh, no. Charlie, help him. Fight back.

1574
01:53:04,934 --> 01:53:06,352
Not yet.

1575
01:53:08,898 --> 01:53:13,526
Tak Mashido supervising
personally as Zeus hammers down,

1576
01:53:13,526 --> 01:53:17,572
furiously trying
to end this thing once and for all.

1577
01:53:17,572 --> 01:53:20,742
I got to tell you,
folks, the champ looks tired.

1578
01:53:20,742 --> 01:53:23,202
This robot
seems to be running on empty.

1579
01:53:26,999 --> 01:53:29,292
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1580
01:53:29,292 --> 01:53:33,087
- Switch to turbo.
- He's actually asking for more.

1581
01:53:35,007 --> 01:53:36,549
Please do something.

1582
01:53:36,549 --> 01:53:39,135
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1583
01:53:41,847 --> 01:53:43,306
Nitrous pistons, now.

1584
01:53:46,435 --> 01:53:48,436
Charlie, he's not going
to last much longer.

1585
01:53:48,436 --> 01:53:50,980
- Fight back.
- Not yet.

1586
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,398
Hang in there.

1587
01:53:52,398 --> 01:53:55,610
Atom is riddled
with the nitrous-fueled

1588
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:58,988
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows.

1589
01:53:58,988 --> 01:54:02,867
Atom. Atom.
Atom. Atom.

1590
01:54:06,330 --> 01:54:08,539
Wait him out,
wait him out. Not yet.

1591
01:54:11,126 --> 01:54:13,127
Zeus is slowing down.

1592
01:54:13,127 --> 01:54:16,047
Tim, the champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1593
01:54:16,047 --> 01:54:17,382
Charlie, please.

1594
01:54:19,135 --> 01:54:22,995
- Hey, kid. Now.
- Now.

1595
01:54:28,435 --> 01:54:29,560
Get in there.
Don't let him breathe.

1596
01:54:31,981 --> 01:54:34,273
Knock that little bitch.
Bust him open.

1597
01:54:41,242 --> 01:54:44,534
Yeah..... That's right.

1598
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:47,412
Do something.

1599
01:54:48,288 --> 01:54:49,330
Move.

1600
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:53,167
Override. Switching to manual.

1601
01:54:55,254 --> 01:54:57,964
In a shocking move,
Tak Mashido is manually

1602
01:54:57,964 --> 01:55:00,008
operating his robot personally.

1603
01:55:10,561 --> 01:55:12,061
Work the body. Get inside him.

1604
01:55:12,061 --> 01:55:13,229
Get him, Atom.

1605
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,316
Look at this.
The champ is trying

1606
01:55:17,316 --> 01:55:21,320
desperately to stay on his feet
but Kenton is relentless,

1607
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:25,407
landing blow after blow
after blow to the body.

1608
01:56:06,317 --> 01:56:09,285
Left. Right. Left. Right.

1609
01:56:09,285 --> 01:56:12,747
A huge uppercut by Atom.

1610
01:56:12,747 --> 01:56:14,749
Zeus is down.

1611
01:56:17,461 --> 01:56:20,463
- Yeah.
- This little bot

1612
01:56:20,463 --> 01:56:25,384
has dug deep here tonight
and shown something damn near heart.

1613
01:56:25,384 --> 01:56:29,848
One, two..... three.....

1614
01:56:29,848 --> 01:56:34,727
four, five, six, seven...

1615
01:56:34,727 --> 01:56:35,895
He's good.

1616
01:56:35,895 --> 01:56:37,230
Zeus gets to his feet.

1617
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:39,565
But Kenton has
Atom on him again,

1618
01:56:39,565 --> 01:56:41,635
landing punch after punch.

1619
01:56:41,635 --> 01:56:44,312
Tak Mashido
and his super bot have no answer.

1620
01:56:44,312 --> 01:56:47,740
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted.

1621
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:50,159
It all comes down to this, folks.

1622
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:52,161
Drop him, Charlie. Now.

1623
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:54,372
Kenton
is about to drop the champ...

1624
01:56:54,372 --> 01:56:56,374
No. There's the bell.

1625
01:56:56,374 --> 01:56:59,993
Zeus is saved by the bell. No.

1626
01:57:03,291 --> 01:57:05,341
No. Amazingly, Tim,
we will go to the judges' cards.

1627
01:57:05,341 --> 01:57:08,999
No. Amazingly, Tim,
we will go to the judges' cards.

1628
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,025
Now..... go on.

1629
01:57:22,025 --> 01:57:25,945
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1630
01:57:25,945 --> 01:57:28,781
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1631
01:57:32,744 --> 01:57:37,165
Judge Number One
scores the fight 47-48.

1632
01:57:37,165 --> 01:57:42,253
Judge Number Two
scores the fight 48-46.

1633
01:57:42,253 --> 01:57:47,049
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46

1634
01:57:47,049 --> 01:57:52,388
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1635
01:57:52,388 --> 01:57:55,638
........Zeus.

1636
01:58:00,272 --> 01:58:04,442
Farra... Farra...
Farra Lemkova...

1637
01:58:04,442 --> 01:58:06,944
...you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1638
01:58:06,944 --> 01:58:09,322
Some would say
that your bot won the decision

1639
01:58:09,322 --> 01:58:11,073
but lost the fight.

1640
01:58:11,073 --> 01:58:12,617
Oh, she looks pissed.

1641
01:58:12,617 --> 01:58:15,411
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1642
01:58:15,411 --> 01:58:18,915
but the result is as expected.

1643
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:21,000
We won.

1644
01:58:21,793 --> 01:58:24,670
Zeus is still undefeated.

1645
01:58:27,424 --> 01:58:29,842
Tak... Tak Mashido... Tak...

1646
01:58:29,842 --> 01:58:32,845
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1647
01:58:32,845 --> 01:58:34,639
your bot suffered tonight?

1648
01:58:37,643 --> 01:58:40,061
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1649
01:58:40,061 --> 01:58:41,646
Max. Where's Max?

1650
01:58:41,646 --> 01:58:44,897
Max, let's go..... go.

1651
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:48,069
There he is. Max. Max.

1652
01:58:48,069 --> 01:58:52,281
They're already calling
your bot "the people's champion."

1653
01:58:52,281 --> 01:58:53,531
Yeah.

1654
01:58:55,118 --> 01:58:57,078
Max, what do you say to that?

1655
01:58:58,038 --> 01:58:59,497
People's champion?

1656
01:59:02,084 --> 01:59:03,918
Sounds pretty good to me.

1657
01:59:09,383 --> 01:59:11,592
Dad? Dad.

1658
01:59:11,592 --> 01:59:14,011
Max. Max. Max.

1659
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,639
- Max.
- Dad.

1660
01:59:23,747 --> 01:59:27,400
Max... Max, I...

1661
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:29,068
I really want you to know...

1662
01:59:29,068 --> 01:59:31,404
No, I need you to know.

1663
01:59:33,448 --> 01:59:34,532
Don't worry.

1664
01:59:36,076 --> 01:59:37,535
Your secret's safe with me.

1665
01:59:44,626 --> 01:59:46,168
Wait here. Wait here.

1666
02:00:00,058 --> 02:00:00,808
Up.

1667
02:00:08,608 --> 02:00:10,359
Yes.

1668
02:00:10,359 --> 02:00:12,320
Yeah.

1669
02:00:30,614 --> 02:00:34,717
- "Yes."
- "Yeah."

1670
02:00:36,094 --> 02:00:38,262
Yeah.
