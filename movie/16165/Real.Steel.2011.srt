00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,610
<s M/> I have been searching all of my days

3
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,020
<s M/> All of my days

4
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,840
<s M/> Many a road in all, i've been working on

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,000
<s M/> All of my days

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,980
REAL STEEL

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
<s M/> I have been quietly standing in the shade

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,700
<s M/> All of my days

9
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,700
<s M/> Watch the sky breaking on promise that we made

10
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,000
<i><s M/> Many a night i found myself with no friends standing near</i>

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,000
<i><s M/> All of my days</i>

12
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,610
Hang on, hang on. Come on.

13
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,948
Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?

14
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,382
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- Jack, I'm going to pay you.

15
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,852
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.

16
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,482
You owe Jack money, too?
charlie You pay me first!

17
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:34,359
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your
money. It's right here in my hand.

18
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,364
Why don't we meet up on the?

19
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,906
- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello?
- I'm losing you.

20
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,498
I can't hear what you're say...

21
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,743
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

22
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,644
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

23
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,386
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,753
Give me a minute.

25
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,056
This...

26
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,529
is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

27
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,822
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...

28
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,484
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

29
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,891
Can we get a picture with him?

30
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,657
Sure. For five dollars.

31
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,857
You want five dollars? Seriously?

32
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,594
No, I want five dollars immediately.

33
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,398
Come on, guys.

34
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,172
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.

35
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,104
- How about $2. 50?
- You suck!

36
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,747
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

37
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,588
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

38
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,148
Please take your seats. We're almost
ready to get this thing started.

39
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,897
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

40
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,728
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

41
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:23,795
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time
has not been good to you, my friend.

42
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,536
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.

43
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:33,138
Last time I saw you, you were staring
at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

44
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,747
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

45
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,685
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,657
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,489
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

48
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,620
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

49
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,220
I'll tell you something.

50
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:53,730
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! How about that?

51
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,163
Get the hell out of here.

52
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,842
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.

53
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,006
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

54
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,778
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.

55
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:14,746
All right, Charlie.

56
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:18,987
Twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

57
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,586
I'll come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

58
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,858
You know that I can do that
because I already done done it!

59
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,800
In life you get too close, in the ring
you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

60
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:33,007
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that
once again. You want to dance again?

61
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:36,567
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.

62
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,673
Don't touch that bull.

63
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,876
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

64
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,545
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

65
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,216
Now, listen, friends, I understand

66
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:54,121
ok we can't all afford to go
all the way over there to Dallas

67
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,167
and pay $300 for one of those
World Robot Boxing League fights.

68
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,567
So, I decided that I would bring
a robot boxing match

69
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,039
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

70
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,575
How about that?

71
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,772
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

72
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,546
Ambush!

73
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,950
Let's do it!

74
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:22,954
All right, big fella.

75
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,259
He's a big fella, ain't he?

76
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,002
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

77
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:39,866
Show them some power.

78
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,843
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

79
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,276
Yeah, big fella.

80
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,642
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

81
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,811
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

82
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,754
ladies and gentlemen,

83
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,621
Black Thunder!

84
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,758
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

85
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,963
Is that all you got?

86
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,937
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

87
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,282
Take him, take him.

88
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,220
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

89
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,155
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

90
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,124
OK. Jump, now!

91
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,804
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

92
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:53,211
but when you mess with the bull,
you're going to get the horns.

93
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,350
You like that. I can tell.
You like that.

94
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,382
Turn around!

95
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,822
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

96
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,874
Come on. We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.

97
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,304
That's it. Come on.

98
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,976
Ricky, enough! Enough!

99
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,249
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

100
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,850
Kill! Kill! Kill!

101
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,387
Come on, get up.

102
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:41,830
Get up! Come on!

103
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,392
No!

104
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,237
Come on, no. No, no, no!

105
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:03,043
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our warriors out here today

106
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,848
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

107
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,889
Thank you for coming out,

108
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,721
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

109
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:13,786
Give me that leg.

110
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,796
Sure. For five dollars.

111
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,490
Boo-yah!

112
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:24,169
All right! That was ridiculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

113
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:28,766
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

114
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,937
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

115
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,847
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!

116
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,147
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

117
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,462
My keys, damn it.

118
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,364
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

119
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:00,874
Charlie, relax.

120
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,877
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus
fight. It cost me my last robot.

121
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,846
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

122
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,419
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen
her in ten years. What does she want?

123
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,248
Nothing. She died.

124
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,488
Do you recall Max Kenton?

125
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,123
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

126
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,956
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

127
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,954
Is he dead, too?

128
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,898
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

129
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:55,894
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

130
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,262
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

131
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:02,997
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.

132
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,130
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

133
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:10,543
Yes. As I've already told you,
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

134
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,213
and we can more than provide for Max.

135
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,843
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

136
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,887
next of kin retains custody.

137
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,152
Charles Kenton,
who is aware of this custody hearing,

138
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,556
and we are expecting him...

139
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,294
No, I need a new robot now.

140
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,887
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

141
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,296
I got to show up with something.

142
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,303
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

143
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:39,101
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

144
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,471
I can live with that.

145
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,277
I don't have it.

146
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,441
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights
to custody right after the boy was born.

147
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,179
I can more than provide for Max.

148
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:54,616
Please be Charles Kenton.

149
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,257
Charlie, yeah.

150
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,997
I'm here to sign some paper
that releases my rights

151
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,066
to the custody of my son.

152
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,101
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

153
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,465
Charlie.

154
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:10,995
Do you even remember me?

155
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,307
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, Debra. How are you?

156
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,344
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

157
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,942
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

158
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,076
Yes, you may.

159
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,983
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

160
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,522
You can spend some time
with him, if you'd like.

161
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,353
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

162
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,359
- Max. Your son?
- All right.

163
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,259
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

164
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,034
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

165
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,534
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

166
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:50,139
Your Honor, I'd like to,
at this juncture,

167
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,942
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

168
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,072
Please.

169
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:02,055
Come on. Come on. There you are.

170
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,687
He'll be in a foster home.

171
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:10,091
No, they find good families.
Young. Energetic. Yeah.

172
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,725
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

173
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,100
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

174
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,179
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

175
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,550
- I'm up for it. But...
- Seventy-five grand.

176
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,744
$75,000? You're serious?

177
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,085
The thing is...

178
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,289
we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

179
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,160
with my oldest friend and his wife.

180
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,324
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

181
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,765
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

182
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,299
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

183
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,267
In August. A 100.

184
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,309
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

185
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,641
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

186
00:14:57,746 --> 00:15:01,238
if you tell her I just signed over
that kid to the state of Texas.

187
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,013
The way I see is, there's a real way everyone gets
what they want here.

188
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,247
So here's what you're gonna do.

189
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,416
You're gonna tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

190
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,653
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

191
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,321
ok Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

192
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,626
for being such
a terrible absentee dad,

193
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:22,033
how I want to make good with junior,
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

194
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:26,073
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero
and everybody wins.

195
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,707
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

196
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,343
I understand.

197
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,646
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

198
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,221
and the other 50
when we get back in August

199
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,222
and you deliver him to us in New York.

200
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,488
Pleasure doing business with you.

201
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,593
Your Honor,
I'm happy we all took the time

202
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,325
to make the best decision for everyone.

203
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,364
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

204
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:59,703
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

205
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,470
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

206
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:18,717
Hello?

207
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,324
Bailey?

208
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,159
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

209
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,529
and it smells like disaster to me.

210
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,124
Nice to see you, too.

211
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,137
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up.

212
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,675
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower? Come on.

213
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,607
Let me make something clear.

214
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,612
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

215
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:41,148
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

216
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,150
Putting aside the fact
that you're doing

217
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,880
what I'm guessing is
a black market deal on my doorstep,

218
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,156
how will you pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

219
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,157
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.

220
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,590
I have been. It's exhausting.

221
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,627
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?

222
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,755
Is that why you're buying a $45,000
robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

223
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:58,355
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

224
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:03,700
Six. There is a guy with real money
who wants to buy this place.

225
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,172
Come on. Like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

226
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,335
If you don't make rent, I can't make
payments and I won't have a choice.

227
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,379
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass

228
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,311
- if you sold this place.
- My father would climb out of his grave

229
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,712
and kick your ass.

230
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,443
Bailey?

231
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:25,550
- Don't.
- Don't what?

232
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,219
Don't do that.

233
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,323
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

234
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,699
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

235
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,897
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

236
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:42,166
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.

237
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,871
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

238
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,441
Marvin.

239
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,511
Your money has arrived.

240
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,847
Marv.

241
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,555
Fifty grand, as promised.

242
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:08,631
Here are all our numbers
and contact info over in Europe.

243
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,466
So that's everything there.

244
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:16,241
So Marvin tells me
you want this time with Max.

245
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,542
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing,

246
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,773
giving me custody.

247
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,372
Caroline would have wanted that.

248
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:25,313
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

249
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,782
That's a deal.

250
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,483
OK, let's go get Max.
OK? Let's get Max.

251
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:39,461
It's OK. You want to go around
the other side here and I'll get Max?

252
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:44,395
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

253
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,908
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

254
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,309
I'm Charlie.

255
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,819
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

256
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,987
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

257
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,355
Do you know where they're going?

258
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,398
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

259
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,797
So how did I get stuck here with you?

260
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,802
Relax, kid. You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

261
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,928
Charlie!

262
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,637
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

263
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,844
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.

264
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:25,573
I'll be right there, OK?

265
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,687
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

266
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,751
Max Kenton.

267
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,018
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

268
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,625
Don't worry about it, OK?

269
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,326
I'm looking at you two and...

270
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,696
Just go and put Noisy
in the shop, please? Thank you.

271
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,608
You're going to stay here with her
while I'm on the road.

272
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,577
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.

273
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,442
No, tell me. I want to know.

274
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,747
Fifty thousand, OK?

275
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,342
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

276
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,853
Will you shut up now?

277
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,682
You sold me?

278
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,482
Sounds worse than it is.

279
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:14,357
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.

280
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,794
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

281
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,661
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

282
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,031
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

283
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,769
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

284
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:26,029
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

285
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:30,607
I don't have it! I spent the money
on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

286
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,009
I'm through here.

287
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,724
What do we got?

288
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,587
Noisy Boy has arrived.

289
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,056
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

290
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,799
- He's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

291
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,528
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

292
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,763
Maybe that's why you got
such a good price, genius.

293
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,431
Decided to stay?

294
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:05,069
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

295
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,940
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks.

296
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,848
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

297
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,621
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

298
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:16,418
Noisy Boy's in there.
You ever heard of him?

299
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,017
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

300
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,426
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

301
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:34,102
His composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

302
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,936
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

303
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,843
He should have had him
in the third round,

304
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,712
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

305
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,723
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

306
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,825
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

307
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,528
You know he has voice recognition,
right?

308
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,434
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

309
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,473
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

310
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,066
Brazilians are crazy
about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

311
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,743
Right, left, uppercut!

312
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:20,883
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

313
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,184
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

314
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,926
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.

315
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,018
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

316
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,496
- Why didn't you ask to look at it?
- Relax!

317
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,501
Was that Japanese?

318
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,101
Let me see if I can reset him
to English.

319
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,804
How do you know Japanese?

320
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,506
Video games.

321
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,111
You play video games in Japanese?

322
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,947
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

323
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,157
Give me that.

324
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,662
He's reset to English,
and I found his command matrix.

325
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,994
They have pre-loaded
a bunch of combinations.

326
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,591
They should be listed here.

327
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:10,929
Top salvo!

328
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,168
What did I tell you?

329
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,069
Gravity One Downtown!

330
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:24,548
I was due for some good luck!

331
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,120
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

332
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,156
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

333
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,031
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

334
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,869
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

335
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,840
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

336
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:52,812
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

337
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,747
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

338
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,582
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

339
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:03,989
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

340
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,787
Don't do this again?

341
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:08,762
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.

342
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,560
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.

343
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,299
Sweet ride.

344
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:22,168
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

345
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:45,825
I'm taking all bets!

346
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:13,057
Keep up. Stay close.

347
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:19,166
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

348
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,792
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!

349
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,902
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

350
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,998
That's Noisy Boy!

351
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,908
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

352
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,211
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?

353
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,685
He can take any bot in this place.
You know it.

354
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,819
You can have any undercard you want.

355
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:44,221
Five thousand guaranteed.

356
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:47,261
A thousand every round
your bot survives.

357
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,262
Fight till the death!

358
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,365
No. Give me the main event.

359
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:56,830
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.

360
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,371
An original Tak Mashido bot.

361
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:01,233
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

362
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:05,945
You want to fight Midas?

363
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,175
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

364
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:13,745
Fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.

365
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,755
Listen, listen. No, look.

366
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,381
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

367
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:20,889
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash and get out of here!

368
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,258
First, there is no "we. "

369
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:25,731
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

370
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,396
We'll take Midas!

371
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,750
Tonight, our main event

372
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:48,846
features the gold-blooded killer!

373
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,785
This pimped-out punk

374
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:56,489
is programmed for pain!

375
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:02,326
I give to you the mighty Midas!

376
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,145
Against a bot

377
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:51,082
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

378
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:57,084
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home,

379
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,490
and he's ready to make some noise!

380
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:03,355
Take your first look in a long time

381
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:08,232
at Noisy Boy!

382
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,001
Crash Palace,

383
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:53,012
who's ready for some destruction?!

384
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:57,607
Let's make some money! Come on!

385
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,615
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

386
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,890
Noisy Boy against Midas.

387
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,222
You've been waiting all night
for this match up, Crash Palace!

388
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,866
Scimitar right!

389
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:18,495
Did you see that?

390
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,905
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

391
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,173
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

392
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,313
Skull salvo! Firefight!

393
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:33,076
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

394
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:36,920
Shockfist!

395
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,958
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

396
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,661
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

397
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,660
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

398
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,403
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

399
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,605
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

400
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,241
I got something for you.

401
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,477
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

402
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:10,650
Get up!

403
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,054
That's illegal!

404
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,256
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!

405
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,632
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

406
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,128
No. Hands up!

407
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,296
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

408
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,972
He's getting killed in there!

409
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:36,613
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

410
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,180
Panic Shield!

411
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,180
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

412
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:47,989
No, no. Shatter Punch!

413
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,997
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

414
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,175
Jab, jab!

415
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:09,608
Right roundhouse!

416
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:13,209
Did he just spit his juice
in Midas's face?

417
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,983
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

418
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,422
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

419
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,618
Use your left!

420
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,426
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

421
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,693
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

422
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,467
No, no! Get up!

423
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,267
Get some!

424
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,080
Move! Get out of the corner!

425
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,548
Midas! Midas! Midas!

426
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:48,778
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

427
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,115
I got something for you! You ready?

428
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:56,463
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

429
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,397
And so long to Noisy Boy.

430
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,263
That sucked. You hungry?

431
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,136
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

432
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,105
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

433
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,836
I need to find a mainframe. What?

434
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,374
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

435
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,779
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

436
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,641
You never should have taken that fight.

437
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,118
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

438
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,520
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

439
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,819
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

440
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,426
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

441
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,260
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

442
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,800
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.

443
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,535
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

444
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,435
Was. Was a great robot
back in the League, back in the day.

445
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,533
But look around you. This place is
where once great robots go to die.

446
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,202
So throw him away.

447
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:21,406
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.

448
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,610
Wow.

449
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,418
It's been a long night.

450
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,718
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

451
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,690
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

452
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,152
They gave me 400 for his head.

453
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,334
You stay put.
I'm going to look for parts.

454
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,471
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.

455
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,709
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

456
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,409
Whatever. Just keep up.

457
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,427
Crap.

458
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,829
Stay back.

459
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,339
All right, keep up.

460
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,476
These searchlights are automated,
but you got to time them right,

461
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,642
so stay close.

462
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:09,514
It's all right.

463
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,922
Come on, come on.

464
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,429
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

465
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,264
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

466
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,564
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

467
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,406
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

468
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:33,670
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

469
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,530
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

470
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,261
Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

471
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,394
- Hey, look.
- What?

472
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,531
It's so small.

473
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:03,371
Yeah. That's before your time.

474
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,571
That's a Generation One,
the very first fighting bot.

475
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,878
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.

476
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,782
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.

477
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:16,015
- What changed?
- A good question. Human boxing.

478
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,292
- It just faded.
- Why?

479
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,624
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.

480
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,825
You had the whole Brazilian underground,
the Gracies, the Machados,

481
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,301
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,
and a thousand styles in between.

482
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:31,735
Full-on ground-and-pound.

483
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,067
- Look at this.
- What's that?

484
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,534
I don't know.

485
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:35,904
Not bad. Good spot.

486
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,041
You still had human fighters,
human bodies,

487
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,577
so you couldn't give the people
what they really wanted:

488
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,946
True, no-holds-barred violence.

489
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,781
The next logical step,

490
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,017
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

491
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,517
Do you miss it?

492
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,524
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

493
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,067
What? I want to know.

494
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,929
Careful, you're on a cliff.

495
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,643
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

496
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,412
Charlie, help me!

497
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,014
Charlie!

498
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,080
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!

499
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,045
Max!

500
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:01,587
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

501
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,723
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

502
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:10,167
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

503
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:14,168
That's it! I've got you!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

504
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,773
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

505
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,175
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

506
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,840
Just give me your other hand very
slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

507
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,580
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.

508
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,885
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

509
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:35,451
One... two... three!

510
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:42,765
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.

511
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,672
You're safe. You're safe.

512
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,880
All right, I got you.

513
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,542
- You all right?
- Yeah.

514
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:01,052
Come here. Easy. Easy.

515
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,188
You all right?

516
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,823
- You all right?
- Yeah.

517
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,860
I told you it was dangerous.

518
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,186
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

519
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,204
Charlie, I think
there's a whole robot in there.

520
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,776
So what? Let's go. Come on.

521
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,516
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

522
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,951
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

523
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:37,046
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.

524
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:40,685
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

525
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,291
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

526
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,625
That's it.

527
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,296
His head does make a nice addition
to the front of the Crash Palace.

528
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,669
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

529
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:38,904
Good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

530
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,880
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

531
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,210
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

532
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,649
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

533
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,722
All your junk is... it's junk.

534
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,918
You're not even in the game any more.

535
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,961
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

536
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,825
Don't get loud with me.

537
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,831
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?

538
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,834
I have been here for you a long time.

539
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,702
In the ring, out of the ring, and the
whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

540
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:09,867
My father invested everything he had
in your fight career. We loved...

541
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:16,213
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

542
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:19,681
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

543
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,252
What's yours?

544
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,796
You're done, right?

545
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:40,738
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

546
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,275
I got nothing left.

547
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,336
All right.

548
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,679
Maybe there's something here.

549
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:55,821
This robot the kid brought in last
night. Would you look at it for me?

550
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,381
Please?

551
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:10,999
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.

552
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:15,769
I found a power cell that fits him, and
I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

553
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:18,003
You can move him around, but he's crap.

554
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:21,047
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

555
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,342
Stop.

556
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,144
It's my robot!

557
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:27,948
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there. He's mine.

558
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:31,718
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts
we're putting in him are mine!

559
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:36,292
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him.

560
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,864
What happened to you?

561
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,217
Watch out. Stay back.

562
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:19,804
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

563
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,975
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory.

564
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,944
- Is there anything here we could use?
- Not much.

565
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,104
There's a bucket...

566
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,475
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck.

567
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,480
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

568
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:36,483
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

569
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,953
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

570
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,358
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

571
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,964
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

572
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:48,899
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

573
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,460
Cool.

574
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,269
"Atom. "

575
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,016
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

576
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:38,414
I don't think he was
ever a boxing robot.

577
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,546
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

578
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,118
They must have built robots
like this one

579
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:46,283
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

580
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:48,554
OK, so can we get him a fight?

581
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:51,353
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

582
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:54,161
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

583
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,929
You could always sell him off for parts.

584
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:59,403
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"

585
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,303
God, you don't quit, do you?

586
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:04,343
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

587
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:07,379
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

588
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:11,645
The places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants.

589
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:14,216
Excellent. Get him a fight.

590
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,351
Stubborn kid.

591
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:23,361
Surprise, surprise.

592
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:06,095
Let's take a walk.

593
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,200
Can you understand me?

594
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,315
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

595
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,176
You've known Charlie a long time.

596
00:48:56,216 --> 00:48:59,515
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

597
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,752
My dad, he trained him.

598
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:06,624
That's them. That's Charlie.

599
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,187
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

600
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,493
- As anything.
- He was something.

601
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,331
He was lean, tough.

602
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,337
No quit, no fear.

603
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:25,769
Come here. I want to show you something.

604
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:31,645
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

605
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,518
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

606
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,146
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

607
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:41,250
I was. Charlie was supposed to be
a warm-up fight, an easy win.

608
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:44,660
Nico wasn't even supposed
to break a sweat, but...

609
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:50,301
nobody told Charlie that, so he
just kept coming and coming at him.

610
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,701
Check this out.

611
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:55,867
That's Charlie.

612
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:00,474
First, Nico couldn't believe
the balls on this nobody.

613
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,279
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

614
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,216
- Really?
- Really.

615
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,878
He was toying with Nico.

616
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:11,680
The top contender,
number two in the world,

617
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,851
and Charlie was dancing with him.

618
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:18,689
Charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night.

619
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,700
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

620
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:24,501
I could.

621
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:28,504
He was beautiful.

622
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:30,873
He was beautiful.

623
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,581
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

624
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:40,449
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

625
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:42,419
Second time for good. Lights out.

626
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:43,819
You were ahead on the scorecards

627
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,251
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell

628
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,260
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years.

629
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:51,387
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

630
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:52,795
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

631
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:57,359
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.

632
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,870
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

633
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:00,639
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

634
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,265
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

635
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,503
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

636
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,546
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

637
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,208
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

638
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,876
Wow. Here.

639
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,347
Keep it.

640
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:20,185
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

641
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:26,495
I like that kid.

642
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,697
He likes you.

643
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:37,234
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

644
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:40,470
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

645
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,777
to see if I can get a partner
or raise money to get a new bot.

646
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:48,821
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

647
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,427
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

648
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:04,827
OK.

649
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,000
Look.

650
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:51,910
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

651
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,645
Yeah.

652
00:52:55,689 --> 00:53:01,127
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds
with this monster. Two rounds!

653
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:04,489
The champ puts his Real Steel world
championship belt on the line tonight.

654
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,589
He just may have a real fight
on his hands.

655
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,002
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time.
Ever. End of story. Good night!

656
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,467
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

657
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:19,602
Come on.

658
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:24,574
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

659
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,481
I want you to stay in this area.

660
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,622
Out of the way. Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.

661
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:32,351
Move, move. Champ coming through.

662
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:47,665
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father/daughter Zeus team.

663
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:51,437
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

664
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:53,435
You're very kind,

665
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:57,482
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

666
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:02,085
What did it take to lure
the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

667
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,552
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport

668
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,092
out of retirement?

669
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,519
Why don't you ask him yourself?

670
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,927
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

671
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:23,633
Zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight.

672
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,768
With his adaptive operating system,

673
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:30,839
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously.

674
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:35,547
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus?

675
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:39,921
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring...

676
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:44,127
the result of any fight is inevitable.

677
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:46,922
What Zeus sees...

678
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:49,798
he kills.

679
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:52,962
Sweet.

680
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:23,535
I'm never going into business with you.

681
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:24,864
I just need a break here.

682
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:27,735
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.

683
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:30,435
I got an old sparring bot,
ain't worth the paint left on it.

684
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:32,010
What am I supposed to do with that?

685
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:34,876
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

686
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:37,006
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

687
00:55:37,117 --> 00:55:39,017
I just need a little loan.

688
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,680
What?

689
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:44,555
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

690
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:46,818
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.

691
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:49,453
You know I'm good for it.

692
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:53,191
I know you, and as much
as I like you, dude...

693
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,061
you're a bad bet, brother.

694
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:01,065
Right, yeah.

695
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,652
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

696
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:25,628
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

697
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,962
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

698
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,058
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

699
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,504
He was just peppering Axelrod with
punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

700
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,065
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.

701
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:39,270
Is that what you think boxing is?

702
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:41,604
Zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him?

703
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:44,615
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

704
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:47,185
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

705
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,513
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

706
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:53,956
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

707
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,086
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

708
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:58,960
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

709
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:01,533
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

710
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:04,866
I told you I hate hamburgers!

711
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:09,868
It's a burrito!

712
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,545
Right uppercut.

713
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:24,920
Left uppercut.

714
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,562
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

715
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:37,794
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

716
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:40,134
You been up all night?

717
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,764
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

718
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,174
I'm using shadow mode to program some
fight moves and sync them to the remote.

719
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,714
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

720
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:51,010
That's lethal stuff.

721
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:52,277
Let's do this.

722
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,578
Let's do breakfast first.

723
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,793
You know you're bringing him
home in pieces, right?

724
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,089
We'll see.

725
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,207
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

726
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,140
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

727
00:58:51,244 --> 00:58:53,838
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

728
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,642
We on a field trip?

729
00:58:57,817 --> 00:59:00,217
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

730
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,117
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for one two-minute round.

731
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:03,654
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

732
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:07,248
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

733
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:10,025
How about 500 for two rounds?

734
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,696
Two rounds. Son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

735
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,235
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

736
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:19,962
Let's just say he does.

737
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:25,139
If he's still standing after one round...

738
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,840
I'll give you a thousand bucks.

739
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,039
Shut it!

740
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:36,385
But if he dies in there,
which he will, junior...

741
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,759
I get to keep what's left.

742
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,761
Take the hundred.

743
00:59:44,263 --> 00:59:45,321
Deal.

744
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:48,996
We're on. We on!

745
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,295
Let's go!

746
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:55,772
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.

747
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,172
Yeah, if he wins.

748
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:24,435
You want me to drive?

749
01:00:24,737 --> 01:00:26,170
He's my bot. I got this!

750
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:29,469
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.

751
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:32,939
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

752
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,206
All right.

753
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:37,274
I got this.

754
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,783
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

755
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,447
Let's get it on like
Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

756
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,316
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

757
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,896
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

758
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:03,237
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

759
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:07,205
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

760
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,777
Here comes the sledgehammer.

761
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:16,982
Did you see that?

762
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,355
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

763
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,360
Slip right. Back step.

764
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:24,255
Duck.

765
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:26,831
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!

766
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,957
Actually, I think I am.

767
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:34,203
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.

768
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:42,845
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

769
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:46,979
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

770
01:01:57,029 --> 01:02:00,226
He can take a hit. I'll give you this.
Your bot can take a hit.

771
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,133
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.

772
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,262
I'm trying!

773
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:15,206
Thirty seconds!

774
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,346
Thirty... Half a minute.

775
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:22,080
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

776
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:26,987
You've got 20 seconds!

777
01:02:28,294 --> 01:02:31,024
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

778
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,889
Move, then. Move!

779
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:41,303
Come on.

780
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,341
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

781
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:48,013
Count with me! Count with me! One!

782
01:02:48,114 --> 01:02:51,311
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?

783
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:53,942
Four! Five! Six!

784
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:55,452
Get up, Atom!

785
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:58,080
All the way up! All the way up!

786
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:02,526
Yes! Yes!

787
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:08,931
I'm going to fix it!

788
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,936
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

789
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,438
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.

790
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,371
Double or nothing
he can't make another round.

791
01:03:16,475 --> 01:03:18,170
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

792
01:03:18,277 --> 01:03:20,609
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

793
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:23,211
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!

794
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:25,341
He can barely stand up in there.

795
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:28,147
Look. I really need the money.

796
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,489
I know. Let's work.

797
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:34,250
Jesus.

798
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:42,025
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

799
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:57,672
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

800
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:01,115
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

801
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:07,718
- Yes!
- No!

802
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:11,486
Start the count!

803
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,996
Start the count!

804
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,535
One! Two! Three!

805
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:20,663
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

806
01:04:20,973 --> 01:04:22,668
Eight! Nine!

807
01:04:22,975 --> 01:04:23,999
Ten!

808
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,344
You did it! We did it! Wow!

809
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:36,248
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

810
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:41,015
I know, I know! I know! I know!

811
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,651
Kingpin, pay up.

812
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,022
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

813
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,498
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

814
01:04:49,735 --> 01:04:51,566
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

815
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:56,267
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.

816
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:58,309
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

817
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:10,783
Bailey, it's me. He won.

818
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:14,185
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

819
01:05:16,095 --> 01:05:17,289
I know.

820
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,025
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

821
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:24,500
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

822
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:29,331
Anyway...

823
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,340
I just wanted you to know.

824
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:09,213
Jab, jab, hook.

825
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,413
Jab, jab, hook.

826
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:19,119
I think you have to move your feet.

827
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:25,654
Your feet. Feet.

828
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:46,943
Nice moves, kid.

829
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,612
How long you been out here?

830
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,177
Check it out.

831
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:55,583
I just spent the night
doing something I think is amazing.

832
01:07:55,688 --> 01:07:57,622
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

833
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:00,687
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

834
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:03,887
I killed it. Got rid of it.
We don't need it any more.

835
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:05,356
How did you?

836
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,729
I had to start over.

837
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,529
But I was able to use
the spin frame from Ambush

838
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:13,298
and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy,

839
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:14,463
and it works.

840
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:17,667
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

841
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:18,868
What works?

842
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:21,776
I got to turn it on.

843
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,883
Left jab, right uppercut!

844
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:28,977
Japan!

845
01:08:29,288 --> 01:08:31,756
You put Noisy's voice recognition
into Atom?

846
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,950
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?

847
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,522
It could be genius!

848
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:38,392
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

849
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:41,523
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?

850
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:44,694
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.

851
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:48,830
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced
enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

852
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,239
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

853
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:53,777
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.

854
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,676
You were a boxer.

855
01:08:55,781 --> 01:09:00,377
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see
things happen before they even happened.

856
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:02,716
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

857
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:05,381
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.

858
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:07,391
You don't need me. Sorry.

859
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:13,689
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

860
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,797
You should do that on Saturday night.

861
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,697
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

862
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:22,638
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

863
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,972
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

864
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:29,475
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

865
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,743
People want to see something
they've never seen.

866
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,546
Look. You think of all the greats.

867
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:37,451
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

868
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:39,353
they all had their nicknames.

869
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:42,484
They had their personae.
They all had flair.

870
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,998
Now you? You might not have much robot,
but with that dance, you got flair.

871
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:50,564
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

872
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,467
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

873
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:55,335
Are you sure you're 11?

874
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:58,572
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

875
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:02,875
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

876
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,482
You're really not messing with me?

877
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:10,919
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

878
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,920
- Cool.
- But...

879
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:19,054
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.

880
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,331
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

881
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:25,027
No. Boxing.

882
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:26,634
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

883
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,900
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

884
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:30,498
And you dance.

885
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:33,905
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

886
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,037
Deal.

887
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,374
Deal.

888
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,817
It's going to be cool.

889
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:39,074
Nice.

890
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:43,813
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.

891
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,708
That's it.

892
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:47,809
Nice.

893
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:54,857
You, too, old man?

894
01:11:55,928 --> 01:11:57,862
Come on. Let's get to work.

895
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:02,725
Nice! Let's do that again.

896
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:06,596
Nice. Three-punch combo.

897
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:08,997
Combo.

898
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,809
Again. Again.

899
01:12:12,845 --> 01:12:16,440
Faster. Faster. Nice.

900
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:20,044
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

901
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,116
Let's see how you move.

902
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:30,152
That's good.

903
01:13:06,064 --> 01:13:08,624
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

904
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,951
That's it. Every time.

905
01:13:35,928 --> 01:13:37,520
Upper cut!

906
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:46,300
Great fight, fellas.

907
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:57,876
105. 5, WRUT,
the satellite home of robot boxing.

908
01:13:57,983 --> 01:13:59,746
Caller two, what do you got for me?

909
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,979
Have you heard about this little bot
out there, his name is Atom?

910
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:03,111
Oh, yeah.

911
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:05,850
My buddies and I saw him
the other night, and he dances.

912
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,926
- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.

913
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,153
He dances pre-fight
with this little kid,

914
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:11,820
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

915
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,763
You put the gimmick aside
for a second,

916
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,335
and I'm holding here a list
of the bots he's beaten.

917
01:14:17,636 --> 01:14:22,130
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.
No slouches on that list, right?

918
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,072
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

919
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:28,306
This bot is fast! He escapes shots
from these bigger bots, it's insane!

920
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:31,606
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,
remember this name:

921
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:36,586
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.
This bot is one to watch.

922
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:44,125
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

923
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,026
Great fight.

924
01:14:46,131 --> 01:14:47,758
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

925
01:14:47,866 --> 01:14:49,800
We'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

926
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,961
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

927
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,631
Right. That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.

928
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,802
Damn right it is. What do you say,
fellas? You ready for the show?

929
01:15:01,346 --> 01:15:02,813
Heck, yeah.

930
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:14,315
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

931
01:15:15,294 --> 01:15:18,320
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.

932
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,326
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

933
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:23,828
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

934
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,804
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?

935
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:31,933
We've come too far to get out there
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

936
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,343
We're going to have fun,
and we're going to not freak out!

937
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:38,980
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

938
01:15:39,084 --> 01:15:42,349
I've spent my whole life waiting
to get here. We're going to...

939
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:47,019
I tell you what. Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

940
01:15:47,926 --> 01:15:49,951
- I got it.
- Good.

941
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:54,928
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

942
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:57,663
What was that? One more time.

943
01:15:57,769 --> 01:16:00,203
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

944
01:16:00,906 --> 01:16:03,807
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up
to the champ's suite. Sure.

945
01:16:33,271 --> 01:16:34,363
Wow.

946
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:38,473
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

947
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:40,768
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

948
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:43,143
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

949
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:47,380
I know you have a very important fight
tonight, so I'll get right to it.

950
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,122
It's a little far from the action for
my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

951
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:55,159
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

952
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,421
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind?

953
01:16:57,729 --> 01:16:59,458
I'd like to buy your robot.

954
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,100
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.

955
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:10,233
$200,000.

956
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:11,900
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

957
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:14,740
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

958
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:20,341
You are 15 minutes away from getting
in the ring with Twin Cities,

959
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:22,386
a vicious League bot.

960
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:27,925
So, to be clear, my offer stands
until the starting bell.

961
01:17:28,026 --> 01:17:32,190
OK. And just to be clear,
he's not for sale!

962
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:34,424
Not now, not ever.

963
01:17:35,767 --> 01:17:37,928
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

964
01:17:38,437 --> 01:17:40,928
Tak, how are you? Max!

965
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,366
Be smart. I know you love him,

966
01:17:45,477 --> 01:17:48,071
but in 20 minutes
there may be nothing left to love.

967
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,274
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.

968
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:55,509
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!

969
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,789
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,

970
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:00,016
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.

971
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:02,422
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

972
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,129
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

973
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:08,893
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

974
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,969
We can go round and round this
all night long.

975
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,367
Look at me.

976
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,070
But it's not going to happen.

977
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:18,506
I got a fight to get to.

978
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:37,060
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

979
01:18:37,162 --> 01:18:41,929
the march towards
the Real Steel Championship

980
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:45,093
makes its way through Detroit's

981
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:49,264
Virgin America Spectrum!

982
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:57,579
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

983
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:00,613
the two-headed tyrant,

984
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:05,151
Twin Cities!

985
01:19:35,554 --> 01:19:40,890
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

986
01:19:40,992 --> 01:19:44,450
hailing from parts unknown,

987
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:46,326
Atom!

988
01:20:42,053 --> 01:20:43,452
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

989
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:45,420
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

990
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:48,287
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.

991
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,287
Look over there. You see those geeks
with the joysticks and consoles?

992
01:20:52,397 --> 01:20:54,194
They're controlling
everything their bot does.

993
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:55,459
They're monitoring his systems,

994
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,161
seeing what he sees,
stadium feeds of the fights.

995
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,329
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

996
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,338
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

997
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,408
So what do we do?

998
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:08,668
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

999
01:21:10,248 --> 01:21:12,045
Seriously, pray.

1000
01:21:14,519 --> 01:21:15,543
Ready!

1001
01:21:16,688 --> 01:21:18,553
- Ready!
- Hands up.

1002
01:21:18,657 --> 01:21:21,091
Fighters ready! Fight!

1003
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:26,028
Engage.

1004
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:32,396
Slip! Right! Lean back.
Right, left! Cover up!

1005
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,030
Duck! Left roundhouse!

1006
01:21:39,678 --> 01:21:41,145
Damn it.

1007
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:52,151
Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!

1008
01:21:52,257 --> 01:21:55,192
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.

1009
01:22:01,099 --> 01:22:02,327
Get your hands up!

1010
01:22:05,203 --> 01:22:07,068
Get out of that corner! Move!

1011
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:12,474
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!

1012
01:22:12,577 --> 01:22:15,410
That guy's got two heads, a foot
of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1013
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,378
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1014
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,583
Wait, wait, wait.

1015
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:28,224
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1016
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:30,760
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

1017
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:33,223
We got him!
See? Here it comes again!

1018
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:36,095
Duck! Spin!
Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1019
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:39,398
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

1020
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:41,529
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1021
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:44,233
Got to get in close where
he can't use that size and reach on us!

1022
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:47,505
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

1023
01:22:47,612 --> 01:22:49,102
Yeah, it's working!

1024
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,114
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1025
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,417
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left! Right hook, slip!

1026
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,183
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!

1027
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:01,850
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

1028
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,129
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!

1029
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,130
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.

1030
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,665
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1031
01:23:11,536 --> 01:23:14,266
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

1032
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,711
We got a systems crash!

1033
01:23:20,812 --> 01:23:22,336
Get him, Atom!

1034
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:26,814
This is not happening, man.

1035
01:23:27,118 --> 01:23:29,313
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

1036
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:31,583
Spin right!

1037
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:34,816
Finish him!

1038
01:23:35,126 --> 01:23:37,151
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!

1039
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:48,464
He's down!

1040
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,740
One! Two! Three!

1041
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:55,745
Four! Five! Six!

1042
01:23:55,847 --> 01:23:57,838
We got him. Stay down!

1043
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:01,750
He's out! He's out!

1044
01:24:07,725 --> 01:24:08,817
Yeah!

1045
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,627
Corner!

1046
01:24:13,731 --> 01:24:16,723
Corner! Corner.

1047
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:19,630
Victory!

1048
01:24:20,839 --> 01:24:25,173
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds

1049
01:24:25,276 --> 01:24:27,642
of the first round,

1050
01:24:27,745 --> 01:24:29,474
Atom has defeat...

1051
01:24:30,582 --> 01:24:33,380
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

1052
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,220
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

1053
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,622
How about that?

1054
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:47,491
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

1055
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,499
Farra Lemkova.

1056
01:24:53,805 --> 01:24:57,571
That instead of buying my robot, using
your money to control this sport...

1057
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,506
- That's it!
- I'm not done.

1058
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,239
Why not give the littlest guy
the biggest shot?

1059
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:06,649
Because I bet if you give him a shot,
he'll surprise you!

1060
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:08,343
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1061
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:10,478
get a shot at the
Real Steel Championship?

1062
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:17,928
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1063
01:25:19,964 --> 01:25:23,957
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1064
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:27,261
You name it! We will be there!

1065
01:25:34,913 --> 01:25:36,881
I'm going to get us that fight!

1066
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:43,811
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1067
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:58,965
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1068
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:00,635
That's one thing to call it.

1069
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:02,000
A lot of people would like to see that.

1070
01:26:02,307 --> 01:26:05,003
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1071
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,005
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1072
01:26:07,312 --> 01:26:08,973
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1073
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,408
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1074
01:26:12,517 --> 01:26:14,007
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1075
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,380
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK. No, no, no.

1076
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:22,653
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right. "

1077
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,728
All right, all right. All right.

1078
01:26:24,829 --> 01:26:28,424
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1079
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,964
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1080
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,871
- We set?
- Yeah.

1081
01:26:34,973 --> 01:26:37,339
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

1082
01:26:38,309 --> 01:26:41,608
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

1083
01:26:41,713 --> 01:26:44,580
I actually really was going to call you.

1084
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,513
Don't worry about that.

1085
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,643
That was a heck of a fight.

1086
01:26:48,753 --> 01:26:51,017
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.

1087
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:54,018
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

1088
01:26:54,993 --> 01:26:56,483
- Come on, man.
- What?

1089
01:26:56,594 --> 01:27:00,724
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1090
01:27:00,832 --> 01:27:02,629
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1091
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:05,828
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.

1092
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:10,101
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

1093
01:27:10,408 --> 01:27:12,933
I'm sure you do,

1094
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:16,070
but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

1095
01:27:16,381 --> 01:27:21,546
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1096
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,416
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

1097
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:26,649
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1098
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:30,057
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!

1099
01:27:30,361 --> 01:27:31,623
Run! Come on!

1100
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,125
Get off him! Get off him!

1101
01:27:38,569 --> 01:27:39,593
Come here!

1102
01:27:43,908 --> 01:27:45,000
Hey, Ricky.

1103
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:46,770
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!

1104
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,081
Stop!

1105
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:04,856
Stop!

1106
01:28:04,962 --> 01:28:08,591
Take all his money. Take it all.

1107
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:13,662
Your friend's a real dirt bag, kid.

1108
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:15,432
He's my father!

1109
01:28:17,575 --> 01:28:22,410
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

1110
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:25,175
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1111
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:33,757
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1112
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:35,120
Let's go, boys.

1113
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:05,182
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1114
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,661
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

1115
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:50,859
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1116
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:55,132
It's not the Zeus people. I've been
thinking about all this, and...

1117
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:58,267
Max!

1118
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,816
It's so good to see you.

1119
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:12,515
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

1120
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:14,682
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

1121
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,692
He's been beat up. I told you
he couldn't take care of him!

1122
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:19,592
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

1123
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:21,722
We're fine. She can leave!

1124
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,859
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

1125
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,570
Charlie, please.

1126
01:30:28,606 --> 01:30:29,698
Just...

1127
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,078
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1128
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:38,982
Charlie, please, no.

1129
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:42,913
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1130
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:46,856
Please. Please.

1131
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,623
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

1132
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:58,133
I know you think you know
what's right, but you don't.

1133
01:30:58,236 --> 01:30:59,897
You're too young. You don't know.

1134
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:01,665
Look at me, trust me.

1135
01:31:01,772 --> 01:31:05,003
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

1136
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:07,808
What can I do?

1137
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,755
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1138
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:27,956
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1139
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:32,764
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

1140
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,634
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

1141
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:37,830
What's going on?

1142
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:40,706
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

1143
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,179
I'm going to wait in the car.

1144
01:31:45,883 --> 01:31:48,351
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1145
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:50,621
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1146
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:53,781
You knew from day one what this was.

1147
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:55,756
You decided to take the ride.

1148
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:00,128
You thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

1149
01:32:00,298 --> 01:32:02,789
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1150
01:32:04,835 --> 01:32:07,235
No, you forgot who I was!

1151
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:14,801
You deserve better...

1152
01:32:16,213 --> 01:32:17,305
than me.

1153
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:23,683
Will you say something, please?

1154
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,222
I tried. What do you want from me?

1155
01:32:26,324 --> 01:32:28,087
I want you to fight for me.

1156
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:31,158
That's all I ever wanted.

1157
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,810
Don't ask.

1158
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:41,357
So no Max.

1159
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,355
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1160
01:34:46,464 --> 01:34:48,295
Did you not see the way
he looked at you?

1161
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:51,799
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1162
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,097
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1163
01:34:54,205 --> 01:34:58,266
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1164
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:01,040
Me, come on. I blew it.

1165
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,312
I blew it.

1166
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,150
When Max was born I just...

1167
01:35:07,852 --> 01:35:09,251
freaked out.

1168
01:35:09,353 --> 01:35:11,548
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1169
01:35:11,856 --> 01:35:13,118
I wouldn't know where to start.

1170
01:35:13,224 --> 01:35:14,248
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1171
01:35:14,358 --> 01:35:15,985
- You do.
- No.

1172
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,053
You do.

1173
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,087
I got to go.

1174
01:35:55,132 --> 01:35:56,599
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1175
01:35:58,202 --> 01:36:00,602
Worth it. Worth it.

1176
01:36:12,049 --> 01:36:13,539
Go get him, Charlie.

1177
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,386
You sound like your dad.

1178
01:36:46,617 --> 01:36:50,451
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1179
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:53,421
and I guess I did originally.

1180
01:36:53,524 --> 01:36:54,548
Then you sold me.

1181
01:36:55,259 --> 01:36:56,385
Charlie.

1182
01:36:57,461 --> 01:36:59,429
You have no business being here.

1183
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,090
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1184
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:06,135
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong
by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1185
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,230
I'd just like to do one thing right.

1186
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,268
Right.

1187
01:37:15,946 --> 01:37:17,573
- Where were we?
- You sold me.

1188
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:19,979
Right, yeah, that happened.

1189
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,279
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.

1190
01:37:22,386 --> 01:37:24,547
And you slept on a shelf in a truck,
and it was awful.

1191
01:37:24,655 --> 01:37:26,384
- And dangerous.
- Really dangerous.

1192
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:30,358
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1193
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:34,420
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1194
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:37,022
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1195
01:37:40,037 --> 01:37:43,598
But no. No, I came to tell you
that I heard you.

1196
01:37:44,575 --> 01:37:48,067
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1197
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:53,108
I know you had a bum ride, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1198
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:55,409
I should have been.

1199
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,144
Your mom was...

1200
01:37:58,656 --> 01:38:00,521
She was cool, wasn't she?

1201
01:38:02,092 --> 01:38:03,150
She was.

1202
01:38:04,028 --> 01:38:05,325
She was the coolest.

1203
01:38:06,163 --> 01:38:08,688
Yeah, she was.

1204
01:38:11,568 --> 01:38:16,562
And I'm sorry about...
what happened with her.

1205
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,605
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1206
01:38:22,713 --> 01:38:26,012
but I'm here right now...

1207
01:38:27,384 --> 01:38:30,649
and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1208
01:38:44,601 --> 01:38:46,330
We got the Zeus fight.

1209
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:47,597
What?

1210
01:38:47,705 --> 01:38:49,605
No, no, we didn't.

1211
01:38:50,507 --> 01:38:52,532
You got the Zeus fight.

1212
01:38:56,447 --> 01:38:58,381
So what do you say, Debra?

1213
01:38:58,482 --> 01:39:00,040
Can we do this one last thing?

1214
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,048
- One night.
- It's all we need. Thank you.

1215
01:39:11,095 --> 01:39:14,724
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1216
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:17,726
Yeah? What do you say?

1217
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:24,371
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1218
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:26,773
Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.

1219
01:39:27,077 --> 01:39:29,272
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

1220
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,645
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1221
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,650
The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight

1222
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:37,414
outside the circle
of well-known League bots,

1223
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:41,651
and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1224
01:39:41,759 --> 01:39:45,286
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1225
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,159
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1226
01:39:47,264 --> 01:39:50,256
gives a shot at the belt
to a G-2 named Atom?

1227
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:54,303
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1228
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,669
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena,

1229
01:39:56,774 --> 01:39:59,800
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this match up.

1230
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:02,738
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1231
01:40:02,846 --> 01:40:05,838
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't
even stop to talk to the press,

1232
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:09,313
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.

1233
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:13,288
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,
did more than just challenge Zeus.

1234
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,618
He did so publicly.

1235
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:18,422
The challenge went viral and created
a PR nightmare for the champ.

1236
01:40:18,529 --> 01:40:22,192
No argument there. And I think the Zeus
camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1237
01:40:22,299 --> 01:40:23,732
That they do. Come on.

1238
01:40:23,834 --> 01:40:26,860
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1239
01:40:27,171 --> 01:40:30,265
This "junkyard dog, " if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1240
01:40:30,374 --> 01:40:33,172
And judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1241
01:40:47,424 --> 01:40:48,789
We can't win, can we?

1242
01:40:49,827 --> 01:40:50,919
We'll see.

1243
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,494
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1244
01:40:57,601 --> 01:40:59,796
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1245
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,614
Atom has arrived
onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1246
01:41:14,718 --> 01:41:17,516
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1247
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:20,215
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1248
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:22,519
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1249
01:41:22,626 --> 01:41:25,493
and the look on
Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1250
01:41:25,596 --> 01:41:27,757
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1251
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:30,698
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1252
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:32,291
Who wants some?

1253
01:41:32,936 --> 01:41:34,631
I'll take some of that action.

1254
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:37,901
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1255
01:41:39,243 --> 01:41:42,303
How's it going... partner?

1256
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:43,777
Partner?

1257
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:47,511
That's great. How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?

1258
01:41:47,618 --> 01:41:50,280
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1259
01:41:50,387 --> 01:41:52,218
You carrying around
that kind of scratch?

1260
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,720
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1261
01:41:56,426 --> 01:42:00,658
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C,

1262
01:42:00,764 --> 01:42:03,460
and you can bring me
my money right to my seat.

1263
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:06,934
101, row C? Hundred K?

1264
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:08,966
You heard me, homey.

1265
01:42:09,273 --> 01:42:10,934
- Homey?
- Right?

1266
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:12,401
Homeboy!

1267
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:15,909
All right. Peace out, posse.

1268
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:17,510
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1269
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:43,933
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!

1270
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:46,334
Never threatened.

1271
01:42:46,443 --> 01:42:49,606
The king of the ring,

1272
01:42:49,713 --> 01:42:51,840
the ruler of robots!

1273
01:42:53,016 --> 01:42:58,352
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1274
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:25,005
Oh, shit!

1275
01:43:31,588 --> 01:43:32,885
That was awesome.

1276
01:43:39,563 --> 01:43:40,723
Come on, let's go.

1277
01:43:47,504 --> 01:43:50,064
Ladies and gentlemen,

1278
01:43:50,374 --> 01:43:52,899
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1279
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:56,446
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

1280
01:43:56,546 --> 01:44:01,074
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

1281
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,444
Showboat!

1282
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:08,790
And in the corner to my left,

1283
01:44:08,892 --> 01:44:11,918
the undeniable champion
of this universe

1284
01:44:12,029 --> 01:44:15,624
and any other universe known
or unknown,

1285
01:44:15,732 --> 01:44:19,964
the mighty Zeus!

1286
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:28,739
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

1287
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:33,839
for Real Steel!

1288
01:44:36,787 --> 01:44:37,947
This is what it's all about!

1289
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:42,048
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

1290
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,088
The bots emerge from their corners.

1291
01:44:44,995 --> 01:44:48,055
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1292
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,491
On your feet!

1293
01:44:49,599 --> 01:44:52,067
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

1294
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:56,938
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

1295
01:44:58,008 --> 01:44:59,066
Get up!

1296
01:45:00,744 --> 01:45:02,905
Push up! Stand up!

1297
01:45:03,947 --> 01:45:06,541
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1298
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:09,118
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

1299
01:45:09,419 --> 01:45:12,411
Atom is down for the second time
in less than ten seconds.

1300
01:45:12,522 --> 01:45:16,481
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

1301
01:45:18,495 --> 01:45:20,019
Get up and get in the game!

1302
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:23,156
Come on! No, please Atom, get up!
Please!

1303
01:45:23,467 --> 01:45:25,992
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1304
01:45:27,637 --> 01:45:31,038
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1305
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:32,665
Lean back!

1306
01:45:32,776 --> 01:45:35,074
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!

1307
01:45:35,178 --> 01:45:37,544
- Get out of there!
- Move!

1308
01:45:39,816 --> 01:45:41,875
A demolishing inside shot.

1309
01:45:41,985 --> 01:45:43,111
Get your hands up!

1310
01:45:45,122 --> 01:45:46,680
Hands up!

1311
01:45:47,624 --> 01:45:49,057
Crush that little can!

1312
01:45:49,159 --> 01:45:50,649
Get out of the corner!

1313
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:54,060
Kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner.

1314
01:45:59,002 --> 01:46:00,060
Get your feet under you!

1315
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:03,797
Good night, sparring bot!

1316
01:46:03,907 --> 01:46:06,637
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1317
01:46:06,743 --> 01:46:10,076
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1318
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,546
- Stand up!
- Two!

1319
01:46:12,649 --> 01:46:14,048
Three!

1320
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:15,516
Atom, get up!

1321
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,678
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1322
01:46:18,188 --> 01:46:21,055
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1323
01:46:21,158 --> 01:46:23,058
Eight! Nine!

1324
01:46:24,094 --> 01:46:28,622
I don't believe this! Against all odds,
this little bot is on his feet again.

1325
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,892
Come on, Atom!

1326
01:46:34,037 --> 01:46:35,197
He can't survive this!

1327
01:46:39,009 --> 01:46:41,204
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1328
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,240
Atom has landed a punch!

1329
01:46:45,549 --> 01:46:50,577
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from
an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1330
01:46:50,687 --> 01:46:52,120
Advance!

1331
01:46:52,222 --> 01:46:53,712
Fade back, counter right!

1332
01:46:54,524 --> 01:46:55,684
Fade back, counter right!

1333
01:46:56,526 --> 01:47:00,963
Right cross! Right cross!
Right cross! Left hook!

1334
01:47:01,064 --> 01:47:03,931
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1335
01:47:04,601 --> 01:47:06,660
For the first time in his dominant run,

1336
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:10,638
Zeus has met a bot
who simply won't back down!

1337
01:47:12,275 --> 01:47:15,108
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1338
01:47:15,212 --> 01:47:18,181
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1339
01:47:18,281 --> 01:47:22,240
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1340
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:25,544
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1341
01:47:25,655 --> 01:47:28,715
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1342
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:37,292
Only five seconds left, as here comes
that piston-packed right of the champ!

1343
01:47:38,835 --> 01:47:42,999
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1344
01:47:43,106 --> 01:47:48,169
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1345
01:47:51,281 --> 01:47:54,614
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1346
01:47:56,086 --> 01:47:59,920
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!

1347
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:05,024
We got to go this way. Come on!

1348
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,897
OK, you sit down.

1349
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:17,767
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1350
01:48:17,874 --> 01:48:19,307
I'll be back for you, baby.

1351
01:48:20,277 --> 01:48:22,609
Get your hands off me!

1352
01:48:25,015 --> 01:48:27,950
Both corners furiously working
on their bots.

1353
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:31,384
This crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre,

1354
01:48:31,688 --> 01:48:33,679
but instead they're getting a war!

1355
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:35,121
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1356
01:48:35,225 --> 01:48:36,249
All right. Here we go.

1357
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:38,657
What is happening?

1358
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:43,756
He is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies. He will be fine.

1359
01:48:43,867 --> 01:48:45,164
What next?

1360
01:48:46,036 --> 01:48:47,333
Round two.

1361
01:48:55,645 --> 01:48:58,944
Round two kicks off,
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1362
01:48:59,049 --> 01:49:01,074
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1363
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:06,414
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1364
01:49:10,193 --> 01:49:15,187
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1365
01:49:20,236 --> 01:49:24,229
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1366
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:31,076
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1367
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:37,250
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1368
01:49:37,354 --> 01:49:39,754
This is a brawl!

1369
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:47,262
The crowd is on their feet, watching two
machines driven to kill each other!

1370
01:49:47,364 --> 01:49:50,060
Something has to give, and it does!

1371
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:51,997
Atom goes down again!

1372
01:49:52,102 --> 01:49:56,232
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight!

1373
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:01,003
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1374
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:05,707
Kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on!

1375
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:17,050
Midway through round four, and Zeus
is looking to end this thing right now.

1376
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,494
The champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1377
01:50:31,775 --> 01:50:35,472
Atom is stumbling around the ring,
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1378
01:50:35,779 --> 01:50:37,178
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1379
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,215
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!

1380
01:50:43,453 --> 01:50:48,220
Zeus has found yet another gear of
violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1381
01:50:48,324 --> 01:50:51,521
No! Stop! Do something!

1382
01:50:51,828 --> 01:50:52,852
He can't hear me!

1383
01:50:54,197 --> 01:50:59,829
But the bell sounds, and once again
this little robot has stunned the world!

1384
01:51:01,938 --> 01:51:06,341
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.
This is murder. We've had enough.

1385
01:51:06,443 --> 01:51:09,003
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!

1386
01:51:09,112 --> 01:51:11,444
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1387
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,817
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1388
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,285
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1389
01:51:18,388 --> 01:51:19,548
No way. No way!

1390
01:51:19,856 --> 01:51:21,824
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1391
01:51:22,325 --> 01:51:24,384
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1392
01:51:24,494 --> 01:51:26,519
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1393
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,991
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1394
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,964
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1395
01:51:31,067 --> 01:51:33,865
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1396
01:51:35,004 --> 01:51:38,462
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1397
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:40,140
Don't ask me. Don't.

1398
01:51:40,243 --> 01:51:44,839
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1399
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,980
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1400
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:58,327
Damn it!

1401
01:51:58,428 --> 01:51:59,486
Yes!

1402
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:01,888
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1403
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:05,332
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1404
01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:06,868
but I know you're in there!

1405
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,234
- Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1406
01:52:12,842 --> 01:52:17,404
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1407
01:52:17,514 --> 01:52:20,176
Watch... me.

1408
01:52:20,283 --> 01:52:23,946
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1409
01:52:25,054 --> 01:52:26,612
Watch me.

1410
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:29,081
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1411
01:52:29,192 --> 01:52:31,285
as the fifth and final round
gets underway.

1412
01:52:31,394 --> 01:52:33,021
Come on, Atom!

1413
01:52:42,539 --> 01:52:44,939
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1414
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:48,169
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring!

1415
01:52:48,278 --> 01:52:50,473
It looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1416
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,447
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1417
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:56,417
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1418
01:52:56,519 --> 01:53:01,115
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom
is backed up against the ropes again.

1419
01:53:03,159 --> 01:53:05,059
Help him! Fight back!

1420
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:06,253
Not yet.

1421
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:13,597
Tak Mashido supervising personally
as Zeus hammers down,

1422
01:53:13,903 --> 01:53:16,633
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all.

1423
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,666
I got to tell you, folks,
the champ looks tired.

1424
01:53:20,977 --> 01:53:23,207
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1425
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,382
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1426
01:53:29,485 --> 01:53:33,114
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

1427
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:36,615
Please do something!

1428
01:53:36,926 --> 01:53:39,156
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1429
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:43,296
Nitrous pistons, now!

1430
01:53:46,436 --> 01:53:48,404
He's not going to last much longer!

1431
01:53:48,504 --> 01:53:50,438
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1432
01:53:51,207 --> 01:53:52,469
Hang in there!

1433
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:58,036
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1434
01:53:59,215 --> 01:54:03,049
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1435
01:54:06,356 --> 01:54:08,483
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1436
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:13,187
Zeus is slowing down!

1437
01:54:13,296 --> 01:54:16,163
The champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1438
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,324
Charlie, please!

1439
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:20,661
Hey, kid.

1440
01:54:21,537 --> 01:54:23,129
- Now.
- Now!

1441
01:54:28,411 --> 01:54:29,469
Get in there!

1442
01:54:32,048 --> 01:54:34,312
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1443
01:54:43,259 --> 01:54:44,624
Yeah! That's right!

1444
01:54:46,195 --> 01:54:47,423
Do something!

1445
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:49,356
Move!

1446
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:53,224
Override. Switching to manual.

1447
01:54:55,271 --> 01:55:00,106
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is
manually operating his robot personally!

1448
01:55:10,553 --> 01:55:13,249
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!

1449
01:55:15,024 --> 01:55:19,518
Look at this! The champ is trying
desperately to stay on his feet,

1450
01:55:19,629 --> 01:55:24,794
but Kenton is relentless, landing
blow after blow after blow to the body!

1451
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,371
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1452
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:14,644
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1453
01:56:19,355 --> 01:56:22,518
This little bot has
dug deep here tonight

1454
01:56:22,625 --> 01:56:25,355
and shown something damn near heart!

1455
01:56:25,461 --> 01:56:29,659
One, two, three,

1456
01:56:29,766 --> 01:56:34,703
four, five, six, seven...

1457
01:56:34,804 --> 01:56:35,828
He's good!

1458
01:56:36,139 --> 01:56:39,472
Zeus gets to his feet,
but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1459
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,338
landing punch after punch!

1460
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,810
Tak Mashido and his super bot
have no answer.

1461
01:56:44,113 --> 01:56:47,207
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1462
01:56:47,316 --> 01:56:50,285
It all comes down to this, folks!

1463
01:56:50,386 --> 01:56:52,286
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1464
01:56:52,388 --> 01:56:55,380
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No! There's the bell!

1465
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,621
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1466
01:57:05,535 --> 01:57:08,436
Amazingly, we will go
to the judges' cards!

1467
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:25,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1468
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:28,749
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1469
01:57:32,695 --> 01:57:37,257
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1470
01:57:37,366 --> 01:57:42,326
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

1471
01:57:42,438 --> 01:57:47,171
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46,

1472
01:57:47,276 --> 01:57:52,475
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1473
01:57:52,582 --> 01:57:54,880
Zeus!

1474
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:04,486
Farra Lemkova,

1475
01:58:04,594 --> 01:58:06,892
you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1476
01:58:07,196 --> 01:58:10,563
Some would say that your bot
won the decision but lost the fight.

1477
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:12,596
She looks pissed.

1478
01:58:13,302 --> 01:58:15,532
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1479
01:58:15,638 --> 01:58:18,835
but the result is as expected.

1480
01:58:20,276 --> 01:58:24,645
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1481
01:58:29,919 --> 01:58:33,252
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1482
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:34,618
your bot suffered tonight?

1483
01:58:37,627 --> 01:58:40,255
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1484
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,694
Max. Where's Max?

1485
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:46,528
There he is. Max.

1486
01:58:48,304 --> 01:58:51,705
They're already calling your bot
"the people's champion. "

1487
01:58:55,244 --> 01:58:57,007
What do you say to that?

1488
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,470
People's champion?

1489
01:59:01,918 --> 01:59:03,442
Sounds pretty good to me.

1490
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,417
Dad? Dad!

1491
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:16,558
Dad!

1492
01:59:27,476 --> 01:59:29,000
I really want you to know...

1493
01:59:29,312 --> 01:59:31,371
No, I need you to know.

1494
01:59:33,482 --> 01:59:34,710
Don't worry.

1495
01:59:35,718 --> 01:59:37,481
Your secret's safe with me.

1496
01:59:44,527 --> 01:59:46,290
Wait here. Wait here.

1497
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:32,668
Yes!
