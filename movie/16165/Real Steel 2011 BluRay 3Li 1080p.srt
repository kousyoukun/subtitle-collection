Whoa, little lady.
What are you doing?

- Can we get a picture with him?
- Sure. For five dollars.

You want five dollars? Seriously?

Whoa, hey, slow down there, hoss.

an 800-pound steer for three grand.

- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

- That bull is, like, 2,000 pounds.

Well, Charlie, I'll tell you something.

- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

68
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:09,802
- You got 20 grand, Charlie?
- In a safe in my truck.

69
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,350
All right, Charlie.
I'll tell you what,

70
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:18,770
twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

to within an inch of your life.

Just like that once again.

Now, listen, friends, I understand,

00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,263
we can't all afford to go all
the way over there to Dallas

Now, thank you all for coming out,

140
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,335
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

Hey, hey! Give me that leg.

142

Sure. For five dollars.

One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

Charlie, relax.

153
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,637
I'm not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.

154
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:04,889
- It cost me my last robot.
- Just listen to us.

155

- She's my ex-girlfriend.

I haven't seen her in like ten years.
What does she want?

00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,732
- Nothing. She died.
- Do you recall Max Kenton?

158
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,194
He's my son.
He's got to be like nine.

159
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:20,029
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

160
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:22,948
[sighs] Is he dead, too?

161
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,951
No, he's fine.
That's why we're here.

162
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,621
[soft music playing]

163
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,898
[man] This court is convened
to address the custodial status

164
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,110
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

165
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:01,195
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.

166
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,988
Father, Charles Kenton.

167
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,199
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

168
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:08,828
Yes. As I've already told you,

169
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,955
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

170
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:14,291
and we can more than provide for Max.

171
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,087
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

172
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:19,839
next of kin retains custody.

173
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,050
Charles Kenton, who is aware
of this custody hearing,

174
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,719
and we are expecting him...

175
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:27,388
[Charlie] No, I need a new robot now.

176
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:29,724
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

177
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:31,392
I got to show up with something.

178
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,644
Noisy Boy is for sale?

179
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:37,314
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much?

180
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:39,650
That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

181
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:41,736
I can live with that.

182
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:44,280
Well, I don't have it have it.

183
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:47,158
Charles Kenton waived all
of his rights to custody

184
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:51,162
right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.

185
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,372
Whoa.

186
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,790
Please be Charles Kenton.

187
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,502
Uh... Charlie, yeah.

188
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,589
[stammers] I'm here to sign some paper

189
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:05,050
that releases my rights
to the custody of my son.

190
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,136
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

191
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,555
Charlie.

192
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,266
Do you even remember me?

193
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:14,977
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?

194
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:16,145
- Mr. Kenton.
- Yeah.

195
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:17,354
Please take a seat.

196
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:22,610
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

197
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:24,111
Yes, you may.

198
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,489
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

199
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,657
You can spend some time with him,
if you'd like.

200
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,451
- With the kid?
- [Debra] Yeah, the kid.

201
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,411
- Max. Your son?
- All right, all right.

202
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,331
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

203
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,751
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

204
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,545
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

205
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:50,179
Your Honor,
I'd like to, at this juncture,

206
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:53,057
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

207
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,517
[judge] Please.

208
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:00,648
Come on. Come on.

209
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,691
There you are.

210
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:05,277
He'll be in a foster home.

211
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,280
No, they find good families.

212
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,115
Young, energetic. Yeah.

213
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:14,328
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

214
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,663
- [phone beeps]
- Oh, hey.

215
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:17,790
Hey, um...

216
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,001
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

217
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:23,963
You know,
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

218
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,549
And...

219
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:29,718
- I'm up for it, but...
- Seventy-five grand.

220
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:31,846
$75,000?

221
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:35,224
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,561
The thing is...

223
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:41,188
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

224
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:45,025
with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

225
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:46,694
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

226
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:50,072
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

227
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,367
In August. A hundred.

228
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:55,452
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

229
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,872
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

230
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,292
if you tell her I just signed
over that kid to the state of Texas.

231
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:05,087
The way I see it, there's a real way
everyone gets what they want here.

232
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:07,381
So here's what you're going to do.

233
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:10,426
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

234
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,887
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

235
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:15,472
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

236
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,643
for being such a terrible absentee dad
how I want to make good with junior,

237
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,812
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

238
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,275
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero,
and everybody wins.

239
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,990
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

240
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,367
I understand.

241
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,912
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

242
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,080
and the other 50
when we get back in August

243
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:42,333
and you deliver him to us in New York.

244
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,710
Pleasure doing business with you.

245
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:49,798
Your Honor, I'm really happy
we all took the time

246
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,508
to make the best decision for everyone.

247
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,430
- Happy?
- [Charlie] Yeah, it's me.

248
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.

249
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:02,937
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

250
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:18,744
Hello?

251
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,372
Bailey?

252
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,165
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

253
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,458
and I gotta tell ya, Charlie,

254
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:27,378
- it smells like disaster to me.
- Nice to see you, too, Bailey.

255
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:30,506
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up, Charlie.

256
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,591
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower?

257
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,636
- Come on.
- Let me make something clear.

258
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,639
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

259
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,183
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

260
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:43,477
Now, putting aside the fact
that you're doing

261
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,230
what I'm guessing is a black market deal
on my doorstep,

262
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:48,315
how are you gonna pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

263
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,651
The money is on its way.
Just, you know, distract him.

264
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,695
- I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best.

265
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:53,946
- Yeah? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,073
Is that why
you're buying a $45,000 robot

267
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,241
when you owe me six grand in rent?

268
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,367
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

269
00:16:58,535 --> 00:16:59,660
- No, six.
- Whoa.

270
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:03,789
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with
real money who wants to buy this place.

271
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,125
Come on, like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

272
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,876
If you don't make rent,
I can't make payments

273
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,378
and I won't have a choice.

274
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:12,047
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass if you sold this place.

275
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:15,175
My father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass.

276
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:16,343
[sighs]

277
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,680
Bailey.

278
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,602
- Don't.
- Don't what?

279
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,396
Don't do that. Don't... that...

280
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:29,189
Hey.

281
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,316
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

282
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,779
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

283
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:38,073
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

284
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,159
I used to. Once. Briefly.

285
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,161
Now I like money more.

286
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:46,039
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

287
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,666
[clears throat]

288
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,710
Marvin.

289
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,004
Your money has arrived.

290
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:56,008
Marv.

291
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,973
Fifty grand, as promised.

292
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:06,101
- Now, here are all our numbers
- Right.

293
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,562
- and contact info over in Europe.
- All right.

294
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,147
So that's everything there.

295
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:16,195
So Marvin tells me you want
this time with Max.

296
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,572
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did the right thing

297
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,241
giving me custody. I think
Caroline would have wanted that.

298
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:22,868
Yeah.

299
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,370
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

300
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:27,748
That's a deal.

301
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,918
- OK, well, let's go get Max.
- OK.

302
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:33,754
OK? Let's get Max.

303
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,384
It's OK. You want me to go on the
other side here and I'll get Max?

304
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,971
Hey, Max.

305
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,349
See you, pal.

306
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:48,060
[Debra] Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

307
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,238
I'm Charlie.

308
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,953
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

309
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,163
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

310
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:09,373
Do you know where they're going?

311
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,542
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

312
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,752
- So how did I get stuck here with you?
- Relax, kid.

313
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,213
You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

314
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:20,008
Charlie, dude's pissed.
He's going to take off.

315
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,427
- Yeah, OK.
- Did Marvin give you that money?

316
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,889
Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?

317
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,767
- OK?
- Hey.

318
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,227
Hey.

319
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:33,146
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

320
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,358
Max Kenton.

321
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,361
- Wow, OK, so this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

322
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:41,655
Don't worry about it, OK?

323
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:43,073
I'm standing here looking at you two...

324
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:46,285
Just go and put Noisy in the shop,
please? Thank you.

325
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,081
[sighs]

326
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,668
So listen, you're going to stay here
with her while I'm on the road.

327
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,086
How much did he give you, huh?

328
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,130
You're coming
at this the wrong way, kid.

329
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,423
No, tell me. I want to know.

330
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,968
50,000. OK?

331
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,262
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

332
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,347
Will you shut up now?

333
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:08,724
You sold me?

334
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:11,476
Sounds worse than it is.

335
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,271
- Really.
- It's just to take care of you.

336
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,356
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

337
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:19,359
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

338
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,111
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

339
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,821
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

340
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:26,199
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

341
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,243
I don't have it!
I spent the money on a robot.

342
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,621
It's gone! OK? Gone!

343
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,414
I'm through here.

344
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,090
All right, what do we got?

345
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,302
Noisy Boy has arrived.

346
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,180
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

347
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,600
- Yep, he's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

348
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:54,353
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

349
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,855
Maybe that's why you got such
a good price, genius.

350
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,110
[Charlie] Decided to stay, huh?

351
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:04,404
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

352
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:05,489
- What?
- By the way,

353
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:08,075
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks or, like, eight.

354
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:12,287
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

355
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,665
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

356
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,375
Noisy Boy's in there.
Have you ever heard of him?

357
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:20,545
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

358
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,298
- [chuckles]
- [beeps]

359
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,553
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

360
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,432
Well, his composite armor
has been replaced.

361
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,059
Let's see if the insides look as good.

362
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:37,896
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

363
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,940
He should have had him
in the third round

364
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:42,943
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

365
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:46,071
[beeping]

366
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,125
[Charlie] Relax, kid. he's on our side.

367
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,836
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

368
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:02,546
You know he
has voice recognition, right?

369
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:04,548
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

370
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:06,591
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

371
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,386
Brazilians are crazy about
that talk-to-your-robot crap.

372
00:22:12,348 --> 00:22:13,974
Right, left, uppercut!

373
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:21,106
Doesn't work.
Right, left, uppercut!

374
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,483
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

375
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:24,901
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

376
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,862
God, look how good he looks, too.

377
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,447
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

378
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:29,865
Why didn't you ask the guy
to have a look at it?

379
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,199
Relax!

380
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,367
[speaks Japanese]

381
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:37,372
Whoa, whoa.
What was that? Was that Japanese?

382
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,833
[speaks Japanese]

383
00:22:42,754 --> 00:22:44,504
Let me see if I can reset him
to English. Hang on.

384
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:47,507
- How the hell do you know Japanese?
- Video games.

385
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:50,260
[Charlie] You play video games
in Japanese?

386
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,179
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

387
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:01,229
- Give me that.
- OK, so he's reset to English,

388
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,440
and I found his command matrix.

389
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,108
They have pre-loaded a bunch
of combinations.

390
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:08,445
- They should be listed here.
- Right.

391
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:11,073
Uh... Top salvo!

392
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,368
- [laughing]
- What did I tell you?

393
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,371
Gravity One Downtown!

394
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:24,544
[chuckling]
I was due for some good luck!

395
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,421
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

396
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:29,466
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

397
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:45,273
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

398
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:46,942
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

399
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,902
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

400
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,864
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

401
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,118
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

402
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:57,494
[jingles]

403
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:01,248
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

404
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:02,374
Don't do that again.

405
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,127
- Don't, don't, don't.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

406
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:08,130
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa!
- Get in. Just get in, will ya?

407
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:09,297
Give me the keys first.

408
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:10,799
No, you can wait
till I get in the truck.

409
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,093
Thanks, Big Pops.

410
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,100
[Max] Sweet ride.

411
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,269

and don't talk.

All right, all right.

- Hey, Finn.

420
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:25,916
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

- That's Noisy Boy!
- [cheering]

422
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:34,925
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

423
00:25:35,092 --> 00:25:36,343
You sure you want
to fight him tonight?

424
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,596
What do you got, Finn? He can take any
bot in this place. You know it.

425

[laughs] You can have

- Five thousand guaranteed.
- Come on, man.

A thousand
every round your bot survives.

00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:13,852
Scimitar right!

467
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,773
Did you see that?

468
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:21,901
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

469
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:25,196
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

470
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:27,490
Skull salvo! Firefight!

471
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,996
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

Shockfist!

473
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,963
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

475
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,805
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

476
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,098
Get up!

477
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:55,518
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

478
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:00,648
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

479
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,359
I got something for you.

480
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,656
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

481
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,742
Get up!

482
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:15,371
That's illegal!

483
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,373
This is the underworld, kid.
There are no rules!

484
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,792
[Finn] Now we're seeing
the Midas touch.

485
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,169
No. Hands up!

486
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:24,422
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

487
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:29,886
He's getting killed in there!

488
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,684
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:38,269
Panic Shield!

490
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:41,272
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

[grunting]

492
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:47,695
No, no. Shatter Punch!

- Five Recall!
- Get some!

494
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,749
Jeez, damn it.

495
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,292
Jab, jab!

496
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,385
Right roundhouse! Roundhouse!

497
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:13,263
[Finn] Did he just spit
his juice in Midas's face?

498
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,932
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

499
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,852
- It's party time now, Crash Palace!
- Use your left!

500
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,022
[Finn] Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

501
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,817
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

502
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,700
No, no, no! Get up!

503
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:36,244
Get some!

He's got...
Just gotta get to the bell.

00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:40,206
Move! Get out of the corner!

[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!

507
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:48,965
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

508
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,051
I got something for you!
You ready?

509
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:56,514
[Finn] Good night!
That's a home run for Midas.

510
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,726
And so long to Noisy Boy.

511
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:12,322
[screaming]

512
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:15,908
[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!

513
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,677
Well, that sucked. You hungry?

514
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:37,055
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

515
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,058
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

516
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,645
I need to find a mainframe. What?

517
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:45,647
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

518
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,315
Fine, more for me.

519
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,025
Here, drink this.

520
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,777
You never should have taken that fight.

521
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,655
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

522
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:56,574
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

523
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,826
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

524
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:02,497
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

525
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,916
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

526
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,834
Of course he lost.
You never gave him a chance.

527
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:09,587
- He wasn't that good.
- Noisy Boy was a great robot.

528
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,507
Was. Was a great robot back
in the League, back in the day.

529
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:14,217
But look around you, kid. This place...

530
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:16,636
This place is where once great robots
go to die.

531
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:19,389
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?

532
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:21,432
Anything you don't need
you just throw away.

533
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,478
Wow.

534
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,106
It's been a long night.

535
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,234
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

536
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:33,986
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

537
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:04,392
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.

538
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:24,579
You stay put.
I'm going to go look for some parts.

539
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:26,330
- I'm coming with you.
- Huh?

540
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:27,874
That drink has my heart pounding.

541
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,209
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

542
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:31,836
Whatever. Just keep up.

543
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:42,054
[thunder crashing]

544
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,348
Crap.

545
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,725
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

546
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,947
All right, keep up.

547
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:02,074
These searchlights are automated,

548
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:04,535
but you got to time them right,
so stay close.

549
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:07,121
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:10,041
Keep up. It's all right.

551
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,710
All right. Come on, come on.

552
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,338
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

553
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,008
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

554
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:23,137
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

555
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:28,309
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

556
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:32,313
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights.

557
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,273
Quick! Go, go, go!

558
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,416
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

559
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,336
Anything. Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

560
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:56,754
- Hey, look.
- What?

561
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:01,509
It's so small.

562
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One,

563
00:36:04,888 --> 00:36:07,932
the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.

564
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,017
The more human, the better.

565
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:12,728
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Here, put that in the cart.

566
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,105
What changed?

567
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,148
A good question.
Boxing, human boxing.

568
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:18,109
- It just faded.
- Why?

569
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,403
Because the money moved on.

570
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:23,072
People wanted more carnage,
more show.

571
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,449
You had the whole Brazilian
underground,

572
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,452
the Gracies, the Machados,
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,

573
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,664
and 1,000 styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.

574
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:32,957
- Look at this.
- What's that?

575
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,918
- I don't know.
- Not bad. Good spot, kid.

576
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:39,213
You still had human fighters,
human bodies

577
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:41,549
so you couldn't
give the people what they really wanted:

578
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:44,886
true, no-holds-barred violence.

579
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,764
So the next logical step:

580
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:51,976
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

581
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,187
Do you miss it?

582
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,567
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

583
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:01,235
What? I want to know.

584
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:03,070
Careful, you're on a cliff.

585
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,199
Whoa!

586
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,703
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.

Look at me. Look at me.
That's it! I've got you, Max!

You don't have to be scared. I got you!

- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

Give me your other hand.
Nice and slow.

601

Just give me your other hand
very slowly.

602
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,360
Reach back. Come on. Reach!

603
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:27,571
All right, look at me.
We're going to do this together.

604
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,490
You and me.
Just look at me.

605

623
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:37,183
Could you just bring the cart to the
edge? I'll use the winch to get him out.

624
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,895
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

625
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:41,872
[wheels whirring]

626
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,002
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

627
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,296
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition

628
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:33,132
to the front of the Crash Palace.

629
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,843
- [scoffs] It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

630
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:39,138
Yeah, good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

631
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:41,849
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

632
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:44,101
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

633
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,811
- No, there's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

634
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:50,357
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.

635
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:52,943
You're not even
in the game anymore, Charlie.

636
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,029
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

637
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:56,947
Don't get loud with me.

638
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,241
- You're your problem, Charlie.
- What's that supposed to mean?

639
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:03,454
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring,

640
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,706
and the whole ugly spiral down,
and I'm tired.

641
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:09,293
My father invested everything
he had in your fight career.

642
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:10,753
We loved...

643
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:16,884
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

644
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:19,720
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

645
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:22,431
What's yours?

646
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:25,476
[sighs]

647
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:35,736
You're done, right?

648
00:42:35,904 --> 00:42:37,071
You're finally done?

649
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:40,658
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

650
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:43,327
I got nothing left.

651
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:46,413
All right.

652
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,502
Maybe there's something here.

653
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,046
This robot the kid brought
in last night.

654
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:55,881
Would you look at it for me?

655
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:57,549
Please?

656
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,261
Bailey?

657
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:08,227
I've never seen
anything like it before.

658
00:43:08,395 --> 00:43:10,396
He's Generation Two, but barely.

659
00:43:10,563 --> 00:43:12,523
I found a power cell that fits him,

660
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:15,943
and I hooked him up
to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...

661
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:18,070
You can at least move him around,
Charlie, but he's crap.

662
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:21,073
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

663
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:24,201
- Charlie, stop.
- [Max] It's my robot!

664
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:27,413
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there.

665
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,164
- He's mine.
- He's yours? Yeah.

666
00:43:29,332 --> 00:43:31,792
But the parts we're
putting in him are mine!

667
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:36,547
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you start fighting over him.

668
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:37,965
What happened to you?

669
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:43,512
Hey.

670
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,097
[beeping]

[electronic whirring]

673
00:43:54,524 --> 00:43:56,567
Whoa. Whoa.

674
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,444
Watch out. Stay back.

675
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:19,882
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

676
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:23,010
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory, Max.

677
00:44:23,178 --> 00:44:25,345
[Charlie] You think there's
anything here we could use?

678
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,347
- [Bailey] Not much.
- There's a bucket...

679
00:44:28,558 --> 00:44:30,517
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck sometimes.

680
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:33,562
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

681
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,648
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

682
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:40,360
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

683
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:43,072
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

684
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:45,991
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

685
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,952
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

686
00:44:49,662 --> 00:44:50,662
Cool.

687
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:26,406
"Atom."

688
00:45:33,873 --> 00:45:37,042
[Max] His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

689
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,794
I don't think he
was ever a boxing robot.

690
00:45:38,962 --> 00:45:42,714
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

691
00:45:42,882 --> 00:45:44,383
They must have built robots
like this one

692
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:46,385
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

693
00:45:46,553 --> 00:45:48,804
OK, so can we get him a fight?

694
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:51,306
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

695
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:54,184
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

696
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,936
You could always sell him off for parts.

697
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:57,396
Can't you get him a fight?

698
00:45:57,564 --> 00:45:59,606
"Why can't you get him a fight?
Get him a fight."

699
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:01,567
God, you don't quit, do you?

700
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:04,570
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

701
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:07,489
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

702
00:46:07,657 --> 00:46:09,950
The places that would
let you fight this robot

703
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:11,827
would make you pee your little pants.

704
00:46:11,995 --> 00:46:14,413
Excellent. Get him a fight.

705
00:46:16,457 --> 00:46:18,458
[mechanical chirping]

706
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:21,461
Stubborn kid.

707
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:23,589
Surprise, surprise.

[Atom whirrs]

714
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:17,494
Can you understand me?

715
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:28,630
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

716

[whirrs]

717
00:48:53,573 --> 00:48:56,116
[Max] You've known Charlie a long time.

718
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:59,619
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

719
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,914
My dad, he trained him.

720
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,752
That's them. That's Charlie.

721
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:11,089
- [Max] What was he like?
- [Bailey] As a boxer?

722
00:49:11,257 --> 00:49:12,591
As anything.

723
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:17,387
He was something.
He was lean, tough.

724
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,389
No quit, no fear.

725
00:49:23,936 --> 00:49:26,646
Come here.
I want to show you something.

726
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,777
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

727
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:35,530
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

728
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:38,492
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
- I was.

729
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:41,328
Charlie was just supposed
to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

730
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:45,123
Nico wasn't
even supposed to break a sweat

731
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:50,378
but nobody told Charlie that, so he just
kept coming and coming at him.

732
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:51,880
Check this out.

733
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:56,593
[Bailey] That's Charlie.

734
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:59,471
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls

735
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:00,847
on this nobody.

736
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:05,227
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

737
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:07,229
- Really?
- Really.

738
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:09,147
He was toying with Nico.

739
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:12,192
The top contender,
number two in the world

740
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,654
and Charlie was dancing with him.
Pop! Pop! Bam! Pop!

741
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:18,865
Charlie was floating inches
off the canvas that night.

742
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:21,868
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

743
00:50:23,162 --> 00:50:24,162
I could.

744
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:31,128
He was beautiful.

745
00:50:33,923 --> 00:50:36,633
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

746
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:40,595
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

747
00:50:40,763 --> 00:50:42,430
Second time for good. Lights out.

748
00:50:42,598 --> 00:50:44,683
You were ahead on the scorecards
going into the 12th round.

749
00:50:44,851 --> 00:50:47,727
Nico Tandy rung my bell
and went on to be the undefeated

750
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:49,229
world champ for the next three years.

751
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:52,107
- So he knocked you out?
- Yeah, so did a lot of guys.

752
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:53,441
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

753
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:55,485
24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.

754
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:57,112
But every fight a knockout.

755
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,156
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

756
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:00,615
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

757
00:51:00,783 --> 00:51:03,285
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

758
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:05,704
- [Max] Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

759
00:51:05,872 --> 00:51:07,747
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

760
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:11,168
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.

761
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,670
Wow. Here.

762
00:51:14,964 --> 00:51:16,423
Keep it.

763
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:20,302
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

764
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:26,683
I like that kid.

765
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:28,935
He likes you.

766
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:37,402
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

767
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,240
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight
to see if I can get a partner

768
00:51:42,408 --> 00:51:44,034
or raise money to get a new bot.

769
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:49,122
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?

770
00:51:53,336 --> 00:51:55,629
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

771
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:05,138
OK.

All right, listen up.
I got to go find Finn.

788
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:27,637

- OK.

789

You're very kind,

the mind behind Zeus

798
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:57,375
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

What did it take to lure the reclusive
genius, former boy wonder

801
00:54:02,465 --> 00:54:04,299
and arguably the most
important bot designer

802
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:07,218
in the history of the sport
out of retirement?

Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

806
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,735
Zeus is autonomous and constantly
evolving during a fight.

807
00:54:23,903 --> 00:54:27,947
With his adaptive operating system
he recognizes patterns

808
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:32,285
and rewrites his fight code
instantaneously.

809
00:54:32,453 --> 00:54:35,789
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...

810
00:54:35,956 --> 00:54:40,794
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring,

811
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:44,381
the result of any fight is inevitable.

812
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,092
What Zeus sees...

813
00:54:48,594 --> 00:54:49,928
...he kills.

814
00:54:51,472 --> 00:54:53,056

[Charlie] I just need a break here,
Finn. C'mon.

819
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:27,215
You got that old bot truck out there.

820
00:55:27,383 --> 00:55:29,134
- You always got something in there.
- I got an old G-2 sparring bot,

821
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:32,262
ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,348
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

823
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:37,100
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

824
00:55:37,268 --> 00:55:39,978
I just need a little loan. Something...

What?

00:55:42,898 --> 00:55:44,566
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

Something. A couple hundred. Few
hundred. Whatever you got.

You know I'm good for it.

That's what's left of Axelrod.

Where you been?
I told you to stay put.

838
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:28,026
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

839
00:56:28,194 --> 00:56:30,361
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

840
00:56:30,529 --> 00:56:33,531
He was just peppering Axelrod
with punches, but so fast.

841
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:36,326
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.

842
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,161
He didn't even survive the first round.

843
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:39,579
Is that what you think boxing is?

844
00:56:39,747 --> 00:56:41,831
Zeus beating up some piece
of steel that they feed him?

845
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,751
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

846
00:56:44,919 --> 00:56:47,504
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

He's more than that. And if you'd
just get us a fight, you'd see.

You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

- He ain't.

Let's just say he does.

not have much robot,

One-Eyed Jack.</i>

<i>No slouches on that list, right?</i>

1091
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,226
<i>But folks,
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.</i>

1092

<i>[caller] I'm telling you, Tommy,
this bot is fast!</i>

1093
01:14:26,646 --> 01:14:28,814
<i>He escapes shots from
these bigger bots, it's insane!</i>

Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.</i>

[both] Atom!

1098

- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

1099
01:14:44,455 --> 01:14:46,456
Great fight, guys.

1100
01:14:46,624 --> 01:14:47,958
- Kenton, you guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

1101
01:14:48,126 --> 01:14:50,002
Good enough, we'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

1102
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:51,962
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

1103
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:55,716
Right. Whoa.
That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

1104
01:14:55,883 --> 01:14:58,302
Damn right it is.
What do you say, fellas?

1105
01:14:58,469 --> 01:14:59,928
You ready for the show?

1106
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:02,806
Heck, yeah.

1107
01:15:02,974 --> 01:15:04,558
[crowd clamoring]

1108
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:15,402
[Charlie] It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

1109
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,613
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed, OK, Max.

1110
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,157
No freaking out.

1111
01:15:20,325 --> 01:15:21,700
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

1112
01:15:21,868 --> 01:15:24,202
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

1113
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,371
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.

1114
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:27,956
You got to have fun,
you understand me?

1115
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,125
We've come too far to get out there

1116
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:32,085
and freak out
and blow this whole thing.

1117
01:15:32,253 --> 01:15:35,630
We're going to have fun, and we gonna...
we're gonna not freak out!

1118
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:39,176
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

1119
01:15:39,344 --> 01:15:42,888
I tell ya, man, I've spent my whole life
waiting to get here. We're going to...

1120
01:15:43,681 --> 01:15:47,851
Because, I tell ya what... Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

1121
01:15:48,019 --> 01:15:50,520
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

1122
01:15:50,688 --> 01:15:55,859
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

1123

What was that? One more time.

1124
01:15:57,695 --> 01:16:00,113
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

1125
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:04,493
Sure. Yeah. Let's head
up to the champ's suite. Sure.

[hip hop music playing]

1127

[Charlie] Wow.

1128
01:16:34,774 --> 01:16:36,566
Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.

1129
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,693
Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton and...

1130
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,821
And this, of course,
is Tak Mashido.

1131
01:16:40,988 --> 01:16:44,157
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

1132
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:46,451
I know you have
a very important fight tonight,

1133
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:47,744
so I'll get right to it.

1134
01:16:47,912 --> 01:16:49,663
It's a little far
from the action for my liking.

1135
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:53,208
It's nice. I like it, though.
Very nicely...

1136
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:55,293
Wow, that is... That's a great shot.

1137
01:16:55,461 --> 01:16:58,088
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...

1138
01:16:58,256 --> 01:16:59,714
I'd like to buy your robot.

1139
01:17:01,926 --> 01:17:04,094
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.

1140
01:17:04,262 --> 01:17:06,263
And for that I'm willing to pay.

1141
01:17:07,265 --> 01:17:10,308
$200,000.

1142
01:17:10,476 --> 01:17:12,602
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

1143
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,355
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

1144
01:17:15,523 --> 01:17:17,482
You are 15 minutes away

1145
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:20,569
from getting in
the ring with Twin Cities,

1146
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:22,487
a vicious League bot.

1147
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:26,158
So, to be clear, my offer stands

1148
01:17:26,325 --> 01:17:27,909
until the starting bell.

1149
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,495
OK. And just to be clear,

1150
01:17:30,663 --> 01:17:32,289
he's not for sale!

1151
01:17:32,457 --> 01:17:34,958
Not now, not ever.

1152
01:17:35,126 --> 01:17:37,919
Listen, give me
a minute to clear this up, OK?

1153
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:40,922
Tak, how are you? Max!

1154
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:45,677
Max. Max. Be smart.
I know you love him

1155
01:17:45,845 --> 01:17:48,221
but in 20 minutes there
may be nothing left to love.

1156
01:17:48,389 --> 01:17:50,557
Think about it.
Take the offer.

1157
01:17:50,725 --> 01:17:53,018
You think about it.
Why does she want Atom?

1158
01:17:53,186 --> 01:17:55,729
Huh? Because he's
different from other bots!

1159
01:17:55,897 --> 01:17:57,522
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller and weaker,

1160
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:58,773
and he's going
to get his ass kicked.

1161
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:03,361
He's a boxer. We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

1162
01:18:03,529 --> 01:18:05,489
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

1163
01:18:05,656 --> 01:18:08,909
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

1164
01:18:09,076 --> 01:18:11,995
Charlie, we can go round and round
this all night long.

1165
01:18:12,163 --> 01:18:13,622
Look at me, look at me.

1166
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:16,249
But it's not going to happen.

1167
01:18:17,502 --> 01:18:18,835
I got a fight to get to.

1168

- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

1186
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,567
All right, now this bot
is tough to put down.

1187
01:20:47,735 --> 01:20:48,693
Atom can do it.

1188

Max, look over there. You see those
geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

They're controlling everything
their bot does.

1190
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,618
They're monitoring his systems,

in there! Tell him what to do!

foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

- Wait, I'm not done.

Why not give
the littlest guy the biggest shot?

Seriously, because I bet if you give him
a shot, he'll surprise you!

I think a lot of people would
like to see that fight.

- That's very funny.

I told you
we shouldn't have sold him.

OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right?

Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

All right, all right. All right.

- No, no. Max is right.

Thank you, Twin Cities.

was going to call you.

Don't worry about that.

That was a heck of a fight.

Congratulations to both of you.
That was really good.

within an inch of your life?

He thought that was a joke.
How about that? It wasn't a joke.

much more than money, don't we?

You decided to take the ride.

Will you say something, please?

I tried, OK. What do you want from me?

I want you to fight for me.

Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1394
01:34:54,581 --> 01:34:59,335
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1395
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:01,086
Me, come on. I blew it.

1396
01:35:03,089 --> 01:35:04,548
I blew it.

1397
01:35:05,675 --> 01:35:07,301
When Max was born I just...

1398
01:35:07,469 --> 01:35:09,303
...freaked out.

1399
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:11,722
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1400
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:13,015
I just wouldn't know where to start.

1401
01:35:13,183 --> 01:35:14,350
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1402
01:35:14,517 --> 01:35:15,851
- You do.
- No.

1403
01:35:16,686 --> 01:35:17,978
You do.

1404
01:35:50,971 --> 01:35:52,179
I got to go.

1405
01:35:55,141 --> 01:35:56,809
Twelve-hundred miles for a kiss.

1406
01:35:58,228 --> 01:36:00,604
Worth it. Worth it.

1407
01:36:11,908 --> 01:36:13,617
Go get him, Charlie.

1408
01:36:16,997 --> 01:36:18,414
You sound like your dad.

1409
01:36:40,562 --> 01:36:42,438
Hey.

1410
01:36:46,526 --> 01:36:50,529
OK. Uh, look,
I know you think I abandoned you

1411
01:36:50,697 --> 01:36:53,532
and I guess I did originally.

1412
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:56,452
- Then you sold me.
- [Debra] Charlie.

1413
01:36:56,619 --> 01:36:59,496
- Hey.
- You have no business being here.

1414
01:36:59,664 --> 01:37:02,082
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1415
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:04,710
And I know I've done
all kinds of wrong by this kid,

1416
01:37:04,878 --> 01:37:07,046
but if you'll let me...

1417
01:37:08,298 --> 01:37:10,424
...I'd just like to
do one thing right.

1418
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:14,345
Right.

1419
01:37:15,972 --> 01:37:17,723
- Now, where were we?
- You sold me.

1420
01:37:17,891 --> 01:37:21,185
- Right, yeah, that happened.
- Wait, what?

1421
01:37:21,353 --> 01:37:24,021
- Then we had our asses kicked.
- And you slept on a shelf in a truck,

1422
01:37:24,189 --> 01:37:25,481
- and it was awful.
- And dangerous.

1423
01:37:25,815 --> 01:37:30,569
Really dangerous. I mean, I know.
God. I'm sorry.

1424
01:37:31,571 --> 01:37:34,531
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1425
01:37:34,699 --> 01:37:37,034
No. I mean yes. Yes.

1426
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,455
But no.

1427
01:37:41,623 --> 01:37:44,458
No, I came to
tell you that I heard you.

1428
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:48,837
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1429
01:37:49,005 --> 01:37:53,133
I know you had a bum ride, Max, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1430
01:37:54,344 --> 01:37:55,552
I should have been.

1431
01:37:56,679 --> 01:37:59,056
Your mom was...

1432
01:37:59,224 --> 01:38:00,474
She was cool, wasn't she?

1433
01:38:02,018 --> 01:38:03,644
She was.

1434
01:38:03,812 --> 01:38:05,854
She was the coolest.

1435
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:08,565
Yeah, she was.

1436
01:38:11,736 --> 01:38:13,737
And I'm sorry about...

1437
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:17,658
...what happened with her.

1438
01:38:19,744 --> 01:38:24,289
And I can't get those years back,
Max, but...

1439
01:38:24,457 --> 01:38:27,084
...but I'm here right now...

1440
01:38:27,252 --> 01:38:30,838
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1441
01:38:44,561 --> 01:38:46,311
We got the Zeus fight.

1442
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:47,688
What?

1443
01:38:48,273 --> 01:38:50,274
No, no, we didn't.

1444
01:38:50,442 --> 01:38:53,068
You got the Zeus fight.

1445
01:38:56,573 --> 01:38:59,825
So what do you say, Debra?
Can we do this one last thing?

1446
01:39:03,329 --> 01:39:04,496
One night.

1447
01:39:04,664 --> 01:39:06,123
One night.
It's all we need. Thank you.

1448
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,840
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1449
01:39:15,008 --> 01:39:16,216
Yeah?

1450
01:39:16,384 --> 01:39:18,051
What do you say?

1451
01:39:20,013 --> 01:39:22,097
<i>[announcer] Welcome, everyone,
to New York's Bing Arena</i>

1452
01:39:22,265 --> 01:39:24,558
<i>and the Real Steel Championship Bout.</i>

1453
01:39:24,726 --> 01:39:27,060
<i>Well, Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.</i>

1454
01:39:27,228 --> 01:39:29,438
<i>Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion</i>

1455
01:39:29,606 --> 01:39:32,900
<i>against the underdog, rising star Atom.</i>

1456
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:34,985
<i>The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight</i>

1457
01:39:35,153 --> 01:39:37,613
<i>outside the circle
of well-known League bots</i>

1458
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:41,783
<i>and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.</i>

1459
01:39:41,951 --> 01:39:45,454
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1460
01:39:45,622 --> 01:39:48,207
The greatest robot boxer of all time
gives a shot at the belt

1461
01:39:48,374 --> 01:39:50,417
to a G-2 named Atom?

1462
01:39:50,585 --> 01:39:54,338
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1463
01:39:54,506 --> 01:39:56,757
[Tim] Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena

1464
01:39:56,925 --> 01:39:59,927
but he has made no bones about
his disdain for this matchup.

1465
01:40:00,094 --> 01:40:02,888
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1466
01:40:03,056 --> 01:40:05,807
Take a look at this clip. Mashido
wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

1467
01:40:05,975 --> 01:40:09,436
<i>referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.</i>

1468
01:40:09,604 --> 01:40:11,688
Now, in truth, Herb, Max Kenton,
Atom's trainer,

1469
01:40:11,856 --> 01:40:13,273
did more
than just challenge Zeus.

1470
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:14,858
He did so publicly.

1471
01:40:15,026 --> 01:40:18,445
The challenge went viral and
created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1472
01:40:18,613 --> 01:40:20,822
No argument there, Tim.
And I think the Zeus camp

1473
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:23,951
- knows exactly what they're doing.
- That they do. I mean, come on.

1474
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:27,037
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1475
01:40:27,205 --> 01:40:30,374
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1476
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:33,210
And, hey, judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1477
01:40:33,378 --> 01:40:35,879
[reporters clamoring]

1478
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:49,226
We can't win, can we?

1479
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:51,395
We'll see.

1480
01:40:55,483 --> 01:40:57,859
[Tim] As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1481
01:40:58,027 --> 01:40:59,987
you can hear
the surge of excitement, Herb.

1482
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:01,738
[crowd cheers]

1483
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:15,043
[Herb] Atom has arrived onto
the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1484
01:41:15,211 --> 01:41:17,921
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1485
01:41:18,089 --> 01:41:20,507
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1486
01:41:20,675 --> 01:41:22,926
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1487
01:41:23,094 --> 01:41:25,929
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face
says it all.

1488
01:41:26,097 --> 01:41:27,889
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1489
01:41:28,057 --> 01:41:31,018
I'm giving 1-to-5 odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1490
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,186
Now who wants some?

1491
01:41:33,354 --> 01:41:34,688
[Ricky] I'll take some of that action.

1492
01:41:34,856 --> 01:41:39,026
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1493
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:42,321
How's it going... partner?

1494
01:41:42,488 --> 01:41:44,448
Partner?

1495
01:41:44,616 --> 01:41:47,534
That's great. How about a
hundred K deep? Is that funny?

1496
01:41:47,702 --> 01:41:50,537
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1497
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:52,456
You carrying
around that kind of scratch?

1498
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:55,876
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1499
01:41:56,711 --> 01:42:00,672
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C

1500
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,759
and you can bring me my money
right to my seat.

1501
01:42:03,926 --> 01:42:07,095
101, row C? Hundred K?

You heard me, homey.

1503
01:42:09,307 --> 01:42:11,058
- Homey?
- Right?

All right. Peace out, posse.

And in the corner to my left,

the undeniable champion
of this universe

Push up! Stand up!

[Herb] But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1542
01:45:07,318 --> 01:45:10,403
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

time in less than ten seconds.

- That's my boy right there!

Get up and get in the game!

No, please Atom, get up! Please!

01:45:23,417 --> 01:45:26,169
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1548
01:45:27,338 --> 01:45:30,298
[Tim] Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1549
01:45:31,717 --> 01:45:33,051
Lean back! Lean back!

1550
01:45:33,219 --> 01:45:35,178
[Herb] Atom's getting pummeled
into the corner!

1551
01:45:35,346 --> 01:45:37,597
- Get out of there, Atom!
- Move, Atom, move!

1552
01:45:39,892 --> 01:45:41,935
[Tim] A demolishing inside shot.

1553
01:45:42,103 --> 01:45:43,311
Get your hands up!

1554
01:45:45,314 --> 01:45:46,898
Hands up!

1555
01:45:47,692 --> 01:45:49,192
Crush that little can!

1556
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,694
Get out of the corner!
Get out of the corner!

1557
01:45:50,862 --> 01:45:53,029
[Herb] Charlie Kenton desperately
trying to command his robot

1558
01:45:53,197 --> 01:45:54,155
out of that suicide corner.

1559
01:45:54,323 --> 01:45:55,657
Cover up!

1560
01:45:58,536 --> 01:46:00,287
[groans] Get your feet under you!

1561
01:46:01,873 --> 01:46:03,874
[Tim] Good night, sparring bot!

1562
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:06,585
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1563
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:10,171
[Herb] Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1564
01:46:10,339 --> 01:46:12,507
- Stand up!
- [crowd chanting] Two!

1565
01:46:12,675 --> 01:46:15,468
- Three!
- C'mon, Atom, get up!

1566
01:46:15,636 --> 01:46:17,804
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1567
01:46:17,972 --> 01:46:21,141
- [referee] Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1568
01:46:21,309 --> 01:46:23,852
[crowd continues] Eight! Nine!

1569
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:26,730
[Tim] I don't believe this!
Against all odds,

1570
01:46:26,898 --> 01:46:28,732
this little bot is on his feet again.

1571
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:30,942
Come on, Atom!

1572
01:46:34,155 --> 01:46:35,322
He can't survive this!

1573
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:41,369
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1574
01:46:42,663 --> 01:46:45,415
[Tim] Atom has landed a punch!

1575
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:48,251
[Herb] Zeus is stunned as he reels back
from an uppercut

1576
01:46:48,419 --> 01:46:51,421
- that he clearly never saw coming!
- Advance!

1577
01:46:52,298 --> 01:46:56,343
Fade back, counter right!

1578
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:58,803
Right cross! Right cross!

1579
01:46:58,971 --> 01:46:59,721
Right cross!

1580
01:47:00,056 --> 01:47:00,847
Left hook!

1581
01:47:01,015 --> 01:47:03,892
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1582
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:04,934
Double right to the body!

1583
01:47:05,102 --> 01:47:06,811
[Tim] For the first time
in his dominant run,

1584
01:47:06,979 --> 01:47:10,523
Zeus has met a bot who simply
won't back down!

1585
01:47:10,691 --> 01:47:12,317
[crowd cheers]

1586
01:47:12,485 --> 01:47:15,195
[Herb] The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1587
01:47:15,363 --> 01:47:18,114
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1588
01:47:18,282 --> 01:47:22,452
[Tim] Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1589
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:25,538
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1590
01:47:25,706 --> 01:47:28,750
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1591
01:47:32,421 --> 01:47:35,632
[Herb] Only five seconds left,
as here comes that monster

1592
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,384
piston-packed right of the champ!

1593
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:38,718
[bell rings]

1594
01:47:38,886 --> 01:47:42,972
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1595
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:45,725
- He made it!
- [Herb] We will have a second round.

1596
01:47:45,893 --> 01:47:48,353
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1597
01:47:51,482 --> 01:47:53,400
He made it!

1598
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:56,111
Yeah! Corner!

1599
01:47:56,278 --> 01:47:57,821
We got to get out of here,
darling, come on.

1600
01:47:57,988 --> 01:48:00,031
We got to get out of here right now!

1601
01:48:02,785 --> 01:48:05,161
We got to go this way.
Come on!

1602
01:48:10,668 --> 01:48:12,001
OK, you sit down.

1603
01:48:15,297 --> 01:48:17,757
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1604
01:48:17,925 --> 01:48:19,551
I'll be back for you, baby.

1605
01:48:20,678 --> 01:48:22,595
Get your hands off me!

1606
01:48:25,474 --> 01:48:28,017
[Herb] Both corners furiously
working on their bots.

1607
01:48:28,185 --> 01:48:31,396
I tell you, Tim, this crowd came here
tonight expecting a massacre

1608
01:48:31,564 --> 01:48:33,690
but instead they're getting a war!

1609
01:48:33,858 --> 01:48:35,233
- You got it?
- [Max] Yeah.

1610
01:48:35,401 --> 01:48:38,653
- All right. Here we go.
- What is happening?

1611
01:48:38,821 --> 01:48:42,031
He is fully prepared
for all possible contingencies.

1612
01:48:42,199 --> 01:48:45,285
- He will be fine.
- What next?

1613
01:48:46,203 --> 01:48:47,537
Round two.

1614
01:48:48,581 --> 01:48:50,498
[rock music playing]

1615
01:48:55,129 --> 01:48:57,338
- [bell rings]
- [Tim] Round two kicks off,

1616
01:48:57,506 --> 01:49:01,885
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1617
01:49:02,928 --> 01:49:06,639
[Herb] Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1618
01:49:10,394 --> 01:49:12,645
[Tim] Kenton working his bot
with a trifecta

1619
01:49:12,813 --> 01:49:15,356
of straight rights
to the champ's dome!

1620
01:49:20,446 --> 01:49:24,449
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1621
01:49:27,536 --> 01:49:31,206
[Herb] Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1622
01:49:34,043 --> 01:49:37,462
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1623
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:40,465
This is a brawl!

1624
01:49:42,593 --> 01:49:44,093
[Tim] The crowd is on their feet,

1625
01:49:44,261 --> 01:49:47,180
watching two machines
driven to kill each other!

1626
01:49:47,348 --> 01:49:50,225
Something has to give,
and it does!

1627
01:49:50,392 --> 01:49:52,143
Atom goes down again!

1628
01:49:52,311 --> 01:49:54,312
[Herb] Lights out
for the junkyard dog

1629
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,439
who put on a heck
of a show here tonight!

1630
01:49:58,609 --> 01:50:01,152
[Tim] And yet again,
Atom rises up.

1631
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:05,782
Kenton must have hardwired this bot
with the will to go on!

1632
01:50:12,248 --> 01:50:17,126
Midway through round four, and Zeus is
looking to end this thing right now.

1633
01:50:17,294 --> 01:50:19,003
[Herb] The champ
is holding nothing back

1634
01:50:19,171 --> 01:50:21,214
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1635
01:50:27,179 --> 01:50:29,222
[electronic whirring]

1636
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:33,685
[Herb] Atom is
stumbling around the ring,

1637
01:50:33,853 --> 01:50:35,645
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1638
01:50:35,813 --> 01:50:37,313
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1639
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:38,857
I think the voice recog is shot!

1640
01:50:39,024 --> 01:50:40,191
- He's not responding!
- What?

1641
01:50:43,529 --> 01:50:46,239
[Herb] Zeus has found
yet another gear of violence,

1642
01:50:46,407 --> 01:50:48,324
drilling Atom's midsection.

1643
01:50:48,492 --> 01:50:52,745
- No! Stop! Do something!
- He can't hear me!

1644
01:50:52,913 --> 01:50:54,122
[bell rings]

1645
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:56,374
[Tim] But the bell sounds,
and once again,

1646
01:50:56,542 --> 01:50:59,210
this little robot
has stunned the world!

1647
01:51:01,547 --> 01:51:04,215
We're done, Max!
He can't hear me.

1648
01:51:04,383 --> 01:51:06,509
This is murder.
We've had enough.

1649
01:51:06,677 --> 01:51:09,053
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- So what? He can't hear me!

1650
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:11,598
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1651
01:51:12,975 --> 01:51:15,685
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1652
01:51:15,853 --> 01:51:18,313
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1653
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,442
- No way. No way!
- Look at them. They are freaking out!

1654
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:24,444
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1655
01:51:24,612 --> 01:51:26,696
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1656
01:51:26,864 --> 01:51:29,032
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1657
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:30,909
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1658
01:51:31,076 --> 01:51:34,287
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1659
01:51:34,997 --> 01:51:38,541
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1660
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:43,129
- Don't ask me. Don't.
- Charlie... please.

1661
01:51:43,923 --> 01:51:45,590
I beg you.

1662
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,058
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1663
01:51:56,894 --> 01:52:00,188
- Damn it!
- Yes!

1664
01:52:00,356 --> 01:52:02,774
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1665
01:52:02,942 --> 01:52:05,443
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1666
01:52:05,611 --> 01:52:06,861
but I know you're in there!

1667
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:09,280
- Come on, Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1668
01:52:12,826 --> 01:52:17,622
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1669
01:52:17,998 --> 01:52:20,208
Watch... me.

1670
01:52:20,376 --> 01:52:23,920
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1671
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:26,798
Watch me.

1672
01:52:27,132 --> 01:52:29,050
An epic battle
being waged here tonight,

1673
01:52:29,218 --> 01:52:31,344
as the fifth
and final round gets underway.

1674
01:52:31,512 --> 01:52:33,179
Come on, Atom!

1675
01:52:42,815 --> 01:52:45,066
[Tim] Wait a second, Herb.
Are you seeing this?

1676
01:52:45,234 --> 01:52:48,319
Charlie Kenton
is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

1677
01:52:48,487 --> 01:52:50,738
[Herb] Tim, it looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1678
01:52:50,906 --> 01:52:53,533
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1679
01:52:53,701 --> 01:52:56,661
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1680
01:52:56,829 --> 01:52:59,038
[Tim] Well, I tell you what, it doesn't
seem to be much help,

1681
01:52:59,206 --> 01:53:01,290
because Atom is backed up
against the ropes again.

1682
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:05,044
Charlie, help him! Fight back!

1683
01:53:05,212 --> 01:53:06,462
Not yet.

1684
01:53:09,008 --> 01:53:13,636
[Tim] Tak Mashido supervising
personally as Zeus hammers down,

1685
01:53:13,804 --> 01:53:17,682
furiously trying
to end this thing once and for all.

1686
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:20,852
[Herb] I got to tell you,
folks, the champ looks tired.

1687
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:23,312
This robot
seems to be running on empty.

1688
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:29,402
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1689
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:33,197
- Switch to turbo!
- [Herb] He's actually asking for more.

1690
01:53:35,117 --> 01:53:36,659
Please do something!

1691
01:53:36,827 --> 01:53:39,245
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1692
01:53:41,957 --> 01:53:43,416
Nitrous pistons, now!

1693
01:53:46,545 --> 01:53:48,546
Charlie, he's not going
to last much longer!

1694
01:53:48,714 --> 01:53:51,090
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1695
01:53:51,258 --> 01:53:52,508
Hang in there!

1696
01:53:52,676 --> 01:53:55,720
[Tim] Atom is riddled
with the nitrous-fueled

1697
01:53:55,888 --> 01:53:59,098
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1698
01:53:59,266 --> 01:54:02,977
[crowd chanting] Atom! Atom!
Atom! Atom!

1699
01:54:03,145 --> 01:54:06,272
[chanting continues]

1700
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,649
Wait him out,
wait him out! Not yet!

1701
01:54:11,236 --> 01:54:13,237
[Herb] Zeus is slowing down!

1702
01:54:13,405 --> 01:54:16,157
Tim, the champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1703
01:54:16,325 --> 01:54:17,492
Charlie, please!

1704
01:54:19,745 --> 01:54:22,705
- Hey, kid. Now.
- Now!

1705
01:54:26,043 --> 01:54:27,251
[electronic beeping]

1706
01:54:28,545 --> 01:54:29,670
Get in there!
Don't let him breathe!

1707
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:34,383
Knock that little bitch!
Bust him open!

1708
01:54:43,352 --> 01:54:44,644
Yeah! That's right!

1709
01:54:44,812 --> 01:54:46,104
[electronic beeping]

1710
01:54:46,271 --> 01:54:47,522
Do something!

1711
01:54:48,398 --> 01:54:49,440
Move!

1712
01:54:50,943 --> 01:54:53,277
Override. Switching to manual.

1713
01:54:55,364 --> 01:54:58,074
[Herb] In a shocking move,
Tak Mashido is manually

1714
01:54:58,242 --> 01:55:00,118
operating his robot personally!

1715
01:55:10,671 --> 01:55:12,171
Work the body! Get inside him!

1716
01:55:12,339 --> 01:55:13,339
Get him, Atom!

1717
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:17,426
[Herb] Look at this!
The champ is trying

1718
01:55:17,594 --> 01:55:21,430
desperately to stay on his feet
but Kenton is relentless,

1719
01:55:21,598 --> 01:55:25,017
landing blow after blow
after blow to the body!

1720
01:56:07,227 --> 01:56:09,395
[Tim] Left! Right! Left! Right!

1721
01:56:09,563 --> 01:56:12,857
A huge uppercut by Atom!

1722
01:56:13,025 --> 01:56:14,859
Zeus is down!

1723
01:56:17,571 --> 01:56:20,573
- Yeah!
- [Tim] This little bot

1724
01:56:20,741 --> 01:56:25,494
has dug deep here tonight
and shown something damn near heart!

1725
01:56:25,662 --> 01:56:29,790
[referee] One, two, three,

1726
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:34,837
four, five, six, seven...

1727
01:56:35,005 --> 01:56:36,005
He's good!

1728
01:56:36,173 --> 01:56:37,340
[Tim] Zeus gets to his feet.

1729
01:56:37,507 --> 01:56:39,675
[Herb] But Kenton has
Atom on him again,

1730
01:56:39,843 --> 01:56:42,345
landing punch after punch!

1731
01:56:42,512 --> 01:56:44,722
[Tim] Tak Mashido
and his super bot have no answer.

1732
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:47,850
[Herb] Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1733
01:56:48,018 --> 01:56:50,269
[Tim] It all comes down to this, folks!

1734
01:56:50,437 --> 01:56:52,271
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1735
01:56:52,439 --> 01:56:54,482
[Herb] Kenton
is about to drop the champ...

1736
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:56,484
No! There's the bell!

1737
01:56:56,652 --> 01:56:59,403
[Tim] Zeus is saved by the bell!

1738
01:56:59,571 --> 01:57:02,323
[crowd cheers wildly]

1739
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:05,451
No!

1740
01:57:05,619 --> 01:57:08,621
[Herb] Amazingly, Tim,
we will go to the judges' cards!

1741
01:57:19,675 --> 01:57:21,801
Now, go on.

1742
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:26,055
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1743
01:57:26,223 --> 01:57:28,891
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1744
01:57:32,854 --> 01:57:37,275
Judge Number One
scores the fight 47-48.

1745
01:57:37,442 --> 01:57:42,363
Judge Number Two
scores the fight 48-46.

1746
01:57:42,531 --> 01:57:47,159
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46

1747
01:57:47,327 --> 01:57:52,498
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1748
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:55,042
Zeus!

1749
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,254
[crowd booing]

1750
01:58:00,382 --> 01:58:04,552
Farra... Farra...
Farra Lemkova...

1751
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,054
...you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1752
01:58:07,222 --> 01:58:09,432
Some would say
that your bot won the decision

1753
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,183
but lost the fight.

1754
01:58:11,351 --> 01:58:12,727
Oh, she looks pissed.

1755
01:58:12,894 --> 01:58:15,521
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1756
01:58:15,689 --> 01:58:19,025
but the result is as expected.

1757
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:21,110
We won.

1758
01:58:21,903 --> 01:58:24,780
Zeus is still undefeated.

1759
01:58:27,534 --> 01:58:29,952
Tak... Tak Mashido... Tak...

1760
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,955
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1761
01:58:33,123 --> 01:58:34,749
your bot suffered tonight?

1762
01:58:37,753 --> 01:58:40,171
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1763
01:58:40,339 --> 01:58:41,756
Max. Where's Max?

1764
01:58:41,923 --> 01:58:43,007
Max, let's go, go.

1765
01:58:45,469 --> 01:58:48,179
There he is. Max. Max.

1766
01:58:48,347 --> 01:58:52,391
They're already calling
your bot "the people's champion."

1767
01:58:52,559 --> 01:58:55,061
Yeah!

1768
01:58:55,228 --> 01:58:57,188
Max, what do you say to that?

1769
01:58:58,148 --> 01:58:59,607
People's champion?

1770
01:59:02,194 --> 01:59:04,028
Sounds pretty good to me.

1771
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:06,614
[crowd cheers wildly]

1772
01:59:09,493 --> 01:59:11,702
Dad? Dad!

1773
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:14,121
Max! Max! Max!

1774
01:59:15,582 --> 01:59:16,749
- Max!
- Dad!

1775
01:59:24,257 --> 01:59:27,510
Max... Max, I...

1776
01:59:27,677 --> 01:59:29,178
I really want you to know...

1777
01:59:29,346 --> 01:59:31,514
No, I need you to know.

1778
01:59:33,558 --> 01:59:34,642
Don't worry.

1779
01:59:36,186 --> 01:59:37,645
Your secret's safe with me.

1780
01:59:44,736 --> 01:59:46,278
Wait here. Wait here.

1781
01:59:50,951 --> 01:59:52,535
[Atom whirrs]

1782
02:00:00,168 --> 02:00:01,752
[Charlie] Up!

1783

- Yes!
- Yeah!

1786
02:00:36,204 --> 02:00:38,372
