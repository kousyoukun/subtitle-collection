- You're into me for 30 grand. - Jack, I'm going to pay you.

我不是 Jack，是Bill Panner.
This ain't Jack! Lt's Bill Panner.

00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,732
你还欠 Jack钱？先还我的
You owe Jack money, too? You pay me first!

- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello? - I'm losing you.

10
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,748
我听不清你在说什么
I can't hear what you're say...

11
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,993
请问那是Ambush么？
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

12
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,894
是的 能见见他么？

00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,779
就是Ambush，醒醒，醒醒
...is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

17
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,072
它要和什么机器人打？ 事实上它要打……
- What robot is he fighting? - Actually he's going to fight...

18
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,734
等等，小美女，你们想干什么？
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

19
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,141
可以跟他合照吗？
Can we get a picture with him?

20
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,907
当然，5块钱
Sure. For five dollars.

21
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,107
5块钱？开玩笑的吧
You want five dollars? Seriously?

22
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,844
没有，我现在就要5块钱
No, I want five dollars immediately.

23
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,648

- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks. - Whatever.

25
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,354
两块五怎么样？ 去死吧
- How about $2.50? - You suck!

26
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,997
又要去那些个小镇上了
It's going to be one of those towns, huh?

27
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,838
女士们先生们，欢迎来到2020圣莱昂德罗
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

28
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,398
请坐好，表演即将开始
Please take your seats. We're almost ready to get this thing started.

29
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,147
听说我的机器人要对抗800磅的家伙
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.

30
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,978
那个不是800磅，蠢蛋
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

31
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:24,045
Charlie，“无所不能”Kenton。混得不怎么样嘛，伙计
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time has not been good to you, my friend.

32
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:28,786
Ricky，我们有大麻烦了 慢点说，慢点说，hoss.
- ,we got a big problem here. - Slow down there, hoss.

33
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:33,388
上次见到你是在休斯顿中心，你还被我的铁臂金刚揍得
Last time I saw you, you were staring at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

34
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,997
找不着北呢
with the taste of my right cross all over your face.

35
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,935
我们来这儿没问题吗 没有
- Are we good to go here? - Yeah.

36
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,907
我们压了3000块同意让我们的拳击手对抗800磅的家伙
We agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.

37
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,739
对吧？ 是的，是这样的
- Am I right? - Yes, sir. We did.

38
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,870
但那家伙看上去有2000磅
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

39
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,470
听好了
I'll tell you something.

40
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,980
要是你的机器人不打我们就不付钱！怎么样
Your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! How about that?

41
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,413
滚出去
Get the hell out of here.

42
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:05,092
要不来点有趣的，我的机器人对抗你的牛，爽快点
Why don't we make this more interesting. My bot against your bull, straight up.

43
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,256
出多少 2万，胜者为王
- How much? - Twenty grand, winner takes all.

44
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,028
2万？你有的起？ 在我卡车的保险箱里
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand? - In a safe in my truck.

45
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,996
好的，Charlie
All right, Charlie.

46
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:19,237
就2万，但要是你输了
Twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,

47
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,836
我会跟着你，揍你直到天涯海角
I'll come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.

48
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,108
你知道我说得出就做得到
You know that I can do that because I already done done it!

49
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:28,050
平常你是紧追不舍的，比赛的时候就怂了
In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

50
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:33,257
好，像上次那样？你想再跳一次舞吗？
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that once again. You want to dance again?

51
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,817
为他欢呼吧，祝他好运，他需要些狗屎运
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck. He needs some luck, y'all.

52
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,923
别摸那牛
Don't touch that bull.

53
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,126
女士们，先生们，我要问问
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

54
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,795
在场的有多少喜欢机器人格斗？
do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?

55
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,466
朋友们，我懂
Now, listen, friends, I understand

56
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:54,371
我们不可能去Dallas
we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas

57
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,417
花300块看机器人拳击联盟比赛
and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights.

58
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,817
所以今天我决定把机器人拳击带到这儿
So, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match

59
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,289
带到 San Leandro
right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.

60
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,825
怎么样？
How about that?

61
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,022
女士们，先生们，向您介绍
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,

62
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,796
Ambush!

Let's do it!

64
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,204
好了，大家伙
All right, big fella.

65
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,509
真是个大家伙，是吧
He's a big fella, ain't he?

66
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:34,252
转过来，让他们看看你有多漂漂
Take a turn. Let them see how beautiful you are.

67
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,116
秀一下
Show them some power.

68
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,093
看看，他在表演功夫
Look at that. He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

69
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,526
大家伙

in the baddest of the bulls competition,

72
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,004
女士们先生，来欢迎

00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,871
Black Thunder!
Black Thunder!

74
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,008
让它上场 开始吧
- Let's get it on! - Let's get this thing started.

75
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,213
你就这点本事？
Is that all you got?

76
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,187
来吧，伙计
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

77
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,532
抓住它，抓住它
Take him, take him.

78
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,470
Ambush用上了攻击波
Ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.

79
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,405
好戏才刚刚开始呢
I got more for you, big fella. We're just getting started.

80
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,374
好了，跳，现在
OK. Jump, now!

81
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,054
Ambush，打倒Black Thunde
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

82
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,461
你和牛厮打的时候要小心咯
but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.

83
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,600
你喜欢这样，我看出来了
You like that. I can tell. You like that.

84
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,632
转身
Turn around!

85
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,072
Ricky， Ricky快让它停下
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

86
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,124
挺住啊，我们还在比赛，跳，跳
Come on. We're still in this thing. Just hop. Hop.

87
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,554
就这样，挺住
That's it. Come on.

88
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,226
Ricky，够了，够了！
Ricky, enough! Enough!

89
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,499
我听不见你的机器人被毁了
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.

90
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,100
毁了他！毁了他！
Kill! Kill! Kill!

91
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,637
加油，起来啊
Come on, get up.

92
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,080
起来，快啊
Get up! Come on!

别这样，不，不，不，不！
Come on, no. No, no, no!

95
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:03,293
女士们先生们，让我们听听这声音
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our warriors out here today

96
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,098
我们的战士在2020莱安德罗被终结了
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

97
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,139
谢谢观赏
Thank you for coming out,

98
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,971

99
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,036
把腿给我
Give me that leg.

100
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,046
好啊，给我5块钱
Sure. For five dollars.

101
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,740
Boo-yah!

102
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:24,419
好了，女士们先生们，这是不是很有趣呢
All right! That was ridonculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

103
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,016
我一会儿找你拿钱， Charlie，你最好真有钱
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy. You best have it.

104
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,187
大家一起说“嘿” 嘿
- Everybody say "hey!" - Hey!

105
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,097
一起说“HO”
- Everybody say "ho!" - Ho!

106
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,397
来看这个，你还好吧，机器小伙？
How about that? How you doing there, little robot?

107
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,712
钥匙拿不出来了，可恶
My keys, damn it.

108
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,614
再上前一步我就把你像你的基友一样揍倒
One more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

109
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,124
Charlie，别紧张
Charlie, relax.

110
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:04,127
我不会给你钱的，这是打假赛，我机器人都被毁了
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus fight. It cost me my last robot.

111
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:07,096
听我们说 还记得Caroline Fallon吗？
- Just listen to us. - Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

112
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,669
我前女友，十年没见了，她想干嘛？
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen her in ten years. What does she want?

113
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,498
没有，她死了

118
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,148
不，他很好，所以我们才来这
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

119
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,144

124
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,463
我们能够好好照顾 Max
and we can more than provide for Max.

125
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:18,093
感谢您的好意，但是根据德克萨斯州法，
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will

126
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,137
没有亲属托管的书面意愿书是不可以的

127
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,402
Charles Kenton，他知道这次听证会

128
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,806

00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,546
我得秀点什么
I got to show up with something.

132
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,553
Noisy Boy打折？这段时间，吵闹男孩太要命了
Noisy Boy is for sale? In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

133
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,351
多少钱？不错啊，有什么毛病
How much? That's a good deal. What's wrong with him?

134
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,721
这个可以接受
I can live with that.

135
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,527
我没有
I don't have it.

136
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,691
Charles Kenton在孩子出生后就没有履行他的监护义务
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.

137
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,429
我可以做的比他更好
I can more than provide for Max.

138
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,866
你就是Charles Kenton吧
Please be Charles Kenton.

139
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,507
Charlie.，是的，是我
Charlie, yeah.

140
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,247
我是来签什么权转让书的
I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights

141
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,316
我儿子的监护权
to the custody of my son.

142
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,351
所以我就来了，需要我来吗？
That's why I'm here. Do I need to be here?

143
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,715
Charlie.
Charlie.

144
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,245
还记得我吗？
Do you even remember me?

145
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,557
Debra，Caroline的姐姐 是的， Debra，你还好吗？
- Debra, Caroline's sister. - Yeah, Debra. How are you?

146
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,594
Kenton先生请坐
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

147
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,192
请问我现在可以见见我的侄子吗？
Your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?

148
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,326
可以
Yes, you may.

149
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,233
那您呢?Kenton先生 什么？
- How about you, Mr. Kenton? - What?

150
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,772
要是您愿意的话，您可以和他呆会儿
You can spend some time with him, if you'd like.

151
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,603
和孩子? 是的
- With the kid? - Yeah, the kid.

152
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,609
Max，他还是你儿子吗？ 好吧
- Max. Your son? - All right.

153
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,509
一天就搞什么机器人，你自己就是机器人
You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.

154
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,284
亲爱的，你在这儿等等，我一会儿就来
Honey, you wait right here. I'm going to be back.

155
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:41,784
没事儿，多久都可以，甜心
You take all the time you need, sweetheart.

156
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,389
阁下，如果可以的话，这种时候
Your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture,

157
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,192
我想叫我的律师过来
step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.

158
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,322
可以
Please.

159
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:02,305
快点，快点，来了
Come on. Come on. There you are.

160
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,937
他会被收养
He'll be in a foster home.

161
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,341
他们会给他找个好人家的，是的，年轻，有活力
No, they find good families. Young. Energetic. Yeah.

162
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,975
谢了， Michael，我会的
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

163
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,350
我是Marvin Barnes， Debra的丈夫 对，是的
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband. - Right, yeah.

164
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,429
Debra真的很想收养 Max
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

165
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,800
我也很赞成，但是 7万5
- I'm up for it. But... - Seventy-five grand.

166
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,994
7万5？你在开玩笑吧
$75,000? You're serious?

167
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,335
事实上
The thing is...

168
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,539
这个夏天我们要和老朋友还有他妻子去意大利
...we're supposed to go to Italy this summer

169

在 Tuscany呆两个月
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

171
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,015
就你们四个，真不错
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

172
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,549
我们八月底会回到纽约
We'll be back in New York by the end of August.

173
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,517
八月，那就10万
In August. A hundred.

174
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,559
10万？ 没错
- $100,000? - You heard me.

175
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,891
你疯了吧 你妻子会更疯
- You're crazy. - Not nearly as crazy as your wife

176
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:01,488
要是你告诉她我签字把孩子交到德克萨斯
if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.

177
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,263
有一个方法大家都皆大欢喜
There's a real way everyone gets what they want here.

178
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,497
接下来就是你要做的
So here's what you're going to do.

179
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,666
告诉你妻子我把监护权交给她了
You're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her

180
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,903
要是我先和孩子过完夏天
if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.

181
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,571
就告诉她
Just tell her how guilty she made me feel

182
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,876
让我当个坏爸爸真的很愧疚
for being such a terrible absentee dad,

183
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:22,283
我多想和他好好相处，尽一个做父亲的义务
how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

184
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:26,323
这样她肯定很高兴，你也当了英雄，就皆大欢喜咯
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero and everybody wins.

185
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:32,957
不要和Debra提钱的事，懂吗？
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?

186
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,593
明白
I understand.

187
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,896
送走Max后我会先给你5万
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max

188
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,471
八月份回来的时候
and the other 50 when we get back in August

189
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,472
你把他送到纽约我们那，我再给你5万
and you deliver him to us in New York.

190
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,738
很高兴与你合作
Pleasure doing business with you.

191
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,843
真高兴大家都抓紧时间办事
Your Honor, I'm happy we all took the time

192
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,575
大家都各得其所
to make the best decision for everyone.

193
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,614
高兴吧？ 是我
- Happy? - Yeah, it's me.

194
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,953
我要 Noisy Boy，我有钱了
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

195
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:02,720
把它带去Tallet体育馆，到那会合
Take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.

196
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:18,967
有人吗？
Hello?

197
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,574
Bailey你在吗？
Bailey?

198
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,409
和你要买的机器人在这
Some guy is here with the robot you're buying,

199
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,779
闻上去真糟糕
and it smells like disaster to me.

200
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,374
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you, too.

201
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,387
忘记说了，你今天真可爱 算了吧
- Might I also say how cute you look. - Give it up.

202
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,925
天，我得去洗澡。你要洗吗？来吧
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower? Come on.

203
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,857
先让我搞清楚
Let me make something clear.

204
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,862
一个恐怖的家伙带着装机器人的箱子
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

205
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,398
在我的体育馆外面坐了俩小时
has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.

206
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
先不管是什么情况
Putting aside the fact that you're doing

207
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,130
我猜是你在我家门口做黑交易
what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep,

208
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,406
Ambush才毁了你怎么付账？
how will you pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?

209
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,407
钱快到了，引开他
The money is on its way. Just distract him.

210
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,840
我一直在，都累死了
I have been. It's exhausting.

211
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,877
你最好了 是吗？真的吗？
- You're the best. - Yeah? Really?

212
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,005
所以你还欠着我6千块就买个4万5的机器人？
Is that why you're buying a $45,000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

213
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,605
就因为我人好？ 3千
- Because I'm the best? - Three.

214
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:03,950
6千。有个有钱人想买这里
Six. There is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.

215
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,422
切，你才不会卖了你爸爸的体育馆
Come on. Like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.

216
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,585
要是你不租的话我就不能付账，我别无选择
If you don't make rent, I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.

217
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,629
要是你卖了这的话你爹会从坟墓里爬出来揍你的
Your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass

218
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,561
我爸会爬出来揍你
- if you sold this place. - My father would climb out of his grave

219
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,962
and kick your ass.

220
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,693
Bailey
Bailey?

221
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:25,800
别 别什么？
- Don't. - Don't what?

222
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,469
别那样做
Don't do that.

223
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,573
别什么 别那样做
- Don't what? - Don't do that thing.

224
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:35,949
你喜欢那样 不
- No, you like that thing. - No.

225
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,147
你喜欢 我不喜欢
- Yeah. - No, I don't like that thing.

226
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:42,416
我以前喜欢，但我现在更喜欢钱
I used to. Once. Briefly. Now I like money more.

227
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,121
我不信 管你信不信
- I don't believe you. - I don't care.

228
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,691
Marvin.

229
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,761
钱到了
Your money has arrived.

230
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,097
Marv.

231
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,805
说好的，5万
Fifty grand, as promised.

232
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:08,881
这是我们在欧洲会用到的号码和联系方式
Here are all our numbers and contact info over in Europe.

233
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,716
都在这了
So that's everything there.

234
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:16,491
Marvin跟我说这段时间你想跟Max呆一起
So Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.

235
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,792
是的 监护权交给我是正确的选择
- Yeah. - You did the right thing,

236
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,023
giving me custody.

237
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,622
Caroline也会高兴的
Caroline would have wanted that.

238
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,563
八月二十七号把他送来纽约
Now, have him back in New York on August 27th.

239
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,032
没问题
That's a deal.

240
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,733
去接Max吧 走吧，接Max去
OK, let's go get Max. OK? Let's get Max.

241
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,711
你要是想去转转我去接Max也行
It's OK. You want to go around the other side here and I'll get Max?

242
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,645
嗨，Max，回头见
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

243
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,158
宝贝儿，夏天结束见
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.

244
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,559
我是Charlie
I'm Charlie.

245
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,069
好久不见了，我是你的……
It's been a long time. You know, I'm your...

246
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,237
你毁了我 说得好
- You screwed me. - Nice mouth.

247
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,605
你知道他们要去哪儿吗？
Do you know where they're going?

248
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,648
意大利？ 对，意大利
- Italy? - Yeah, Italy.

249
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,047
我怎么跟你呆在这？
So how did I get stuck here with you?

250
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:16,052
别担心，孩子，美好生活还长着呢
Relax, kid. You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.

251
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,178
Charlie!

252
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,887
那家伙生气了，他要走了
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

253
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,094
是Marvin给你的钱吗？ 给，交易结束
- Did Marvin give you that money? - Here, just close the deal.

254
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,823
我一会儿过去
I'll be right there, OK?

255
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,937
我是Bailey
- I'm Bailey. - Max.

256
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,001
Max Kenton.

257
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,268
他就是你的…… 是的
- So this is your... - Yeah, it's him.

258
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,875
Don't worry about it, OK?

259
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,576
我看你们……
I'm looking at you two and...

260
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,946
拜托你去把Noisy Boy放到店里。谢了
Just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.

261
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,858
你和她呆在这儿，我先走
You're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.

262
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,827
他给了你多少？ 你不该说这个
- How much did he give you? - You're coming at this the wrong way.

263
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,692
告诉我，我想知道
No, tell me. I want to know.

264
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,997
5千，好了吧
Fifty thousand, OK?

265
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,592
他给我5千把你签给她
He gave me $50,000 to sign you over to her.

266
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,103
可以闭嘴了吗？
Will you shut up now?

267
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,932
你把我卖了？
You sold me?

268
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,732
比这更糟
Sounds worse than it is.

269
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,607
是吗 我会好好照顾你的
- Really. - It's to take care of you.

270
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,044
分我一半，不用你照顾
Give me half the money and you won't have to.

271
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,911
你要去哪？ 给我钱，我会活得好好的
- Where are you going to go? - Give me the money. I'll be fine.

272
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,281
我跟你婶婶说好了夏天结束就把你送去纽约
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.

273
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,019
现在你关心起婶婶 Debra了？
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

274
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,279
你5千块把我卖了，你欠我一半
You sold me for 50 grand. You owe me half!

275
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:30,857
我现在没钱，钱都花了去买机器人了，一分也没有了
I don't have it! I spent the money on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

276
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,259
我要走了
I'm through here.

277
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,974
怎么样
What do we got?

278
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,837
Noisy Boy到了
Noisy Boy has arrived.

279
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,306
好多航空贴纸和标签
That's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.

280
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:52,049
它都环游世界了 - London, Japan, Brazil, So Paulo... 伦敦，日本，巴西，圣保罗
- He's been all over the world.

281
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,778
两年没去北美了
Hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.

282
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,013
所以才那么实惠，天才
Maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.

283
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,681
想说什么吗？
Decided to stay?

284
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,319
这是Bailey，这几周她会照顾你
This is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.

285
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,190
帮我照顾这个孩子几个星期
I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks.

286
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,098
我要一半钱 又要说这个？
- I want half that money. - Are we back to this again?

287
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,871
里面真的有个机器人拳击手？
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

288
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,668
Noisy Boy，听说过吗？
Noisy Boy's in there. You ever heard of him?

289
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,267
当然，他在2016年在WRB击败了 Rubicon
Of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.

290
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,676
我的娘，真是太棒了
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

291
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,352
她的复合装甲已经换过了，看看里面是否完好
His composite armor has been replaced. Let's see if the insides look as good.

292
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,186
我看他和 Rubicon打了20多次
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.

293
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,093
他本来应该在第三轮撂倒他的
He should have had him in the third round,

294
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,962
但是Rubicon运气好然后结果了他
but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.

295
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,973
别担心孩子，他站我们这边
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

296
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,075
不好笑 挺好笑的
- Not funny. - Kind of funny.

297
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,778
他可以识别声音，对吧？
You know he has voice recognition, right?

298
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:04,684
不可以 他没在过联盟
- No, he doesn't. - He didn't in the League.

299
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,723
Noisy在巴西的时候肯定被植入了程序
When Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.

300
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,316
巴西人对和机器人对话痴迷
Brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

301
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,993
向右，向左，上勾拳
Right, left, uppercut!

302
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,133
没用，向右，向左，上勾拳
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

303
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,434
我就是到便宜没好货，我们被坑了
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.

304
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,176
看看能不能修好它 他看上去真棒
- Let me see if I can fix it. - Look how good he looks, too.

305
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,268
给我两秒钟，我看看
Give me two seconds. Let me look at something!

306
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,746
为什么不看看他 别吵
- Why didn't you ask to look at it? - Relax!

307
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,751
日语？
Was that Japanese?

308
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,351
我看看能不能重设成英语
Let me see if I can reset him to English.

309
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,054
你怎么会日语
How do you know Japanese?

310
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,756
打游戏学的
Video games.

311
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,361
你打日本游戏？
You play video games in Japanese?

312
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,197
日本走私品一直都挺好
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

313
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,407
给我
Give me that.

314
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,912
重设成了，我还发现了这个命令矩阵
He's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.

315
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,244
他们下了一堆组合
They have pre-Ioaded a bunch of combinations.

316
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,841
应该列在这了
They should be listed here.

317
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,179
头槌
Top salvo!

318
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,418

00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,319
Gravity One Downtown!

320
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,798
风水轮流转啦

给我钥匙 我和你一起去
- Give me the keys. - I'm coming with you.

324
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,119
不要 为什么
- No, you're not. - Why not?

325
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,090
因为我不想带上你
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

326
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:53,062
要么我跟你去，要么你在下水道口钓钥匙
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.

327
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:55,997

Your choice. What's it going to be, old man?

328

Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

329
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:04,239
别那样！ 吓到你了，是吧
- Don't do that again. - That's scaring you, isn't it?

330
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,037
还要再来一次吗？
Don't do this again?

331

Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

396
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:21,378
不，抬起手
No. Hands up!

397
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,546
滚回你的角落，婊子，男人点干死他
Get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!

398
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,222
他要被揍扁了
He's getting killed in there!

399
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,863
是语言操控，你指挥他做什么
It's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!

400
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,430
Panic Shield!

401
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,430
就是这个One-Two Overlord
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

402
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,239
不对不对 Shatter Punch
No, no. Shatter Punch!

403
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,247
碎他蛋
- Five Recall! - Get some!

404
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,425
猛击，猛击！
Jab, jab!

405
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,858
Right roundhouse!

406
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:13,459
他刚是吐Midas口水吗？
Did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?

407
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,233
你不能向Midas吐口水
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

408
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,672
这是在碰撞宫殿，是疯狂的时候
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

409
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,868
用左手
Use your left!

410
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,676
Noisy想用左手反抗
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!

411
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,943
但是Midas见缝插针，游戏要结束了
But Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!

412
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,717
不不，起来啊
No, no! Get up!

413
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,517
行动啊
Get some!

414
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,330
动啊，离开角落
Move! Get out of the corner!

415
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,798
Midas! Midas! Midas!

416
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:49,028
卡普奇诺来了
Somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!

417
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,365
给你点颜色看看，准备好了吗
I got something for you! You ready?

418
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:56,713
晚安！Midas凯旋而归
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

419
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,647
Noisy Boy屁滚尿流
And so long to Noisy Boy.

420
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,513
真糟糕，你饿不？
That sucked. You hungry?

421
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,386
我留下了 Noisy的声音识别板
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.

422
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,355
除了那玩意儿他就一垃圾，我要从新搞个机器人了
Other than that, he's trash. I got to get a new robot together.

423
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,086
我的找到主机，怎么了？
I need to find a mainframe. What?

424
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,624
我讨厌汉堡 哪个小孩会讨厌汉堡
- I hate hamburgers. - What kid hates burgers?

425
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,029
好吧，不吃给我，你喝这个
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

426
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,891
你不该参加那场比赛的
You never should have taken that fight.

427
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,368
是吗是吗？谢了，天才
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

428
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,770
你做事前有动脑子想过吗？
Do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?

429
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,069
你根本不知道怎么打
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

430
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,676
这些组合口令你一半都不知道
Those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.

431
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,510
你自大的，毫无计划的就把他们丢那
You threw them in there cocky and half-assed.

432
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,050
连个机会也不给他 他没那么好
- You never gave him a chance. - He wasn't that good.

433
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,785
Noisy Boy是台很棒的机器人
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

434
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,685
以前，在联盟的时候很棒
Was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.

435
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,783
但这里，在这里曾经很棒的机器人都报废了
But look around you. This place is where once great robots go to die.

436
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,452
所以就把它扔了？
So throw him away.

437
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:21,656
你就是这么做的事？不需要就扔了？
That's what you do, right? Anything you don't need you throw away.

438
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,860
Wow.

439
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:28,668
漫长的一夜
It's been a long night.

440
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,968
你想在屋子里睡觉就闭嘴上车
If you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.

441
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,940
别那样看着我，上车
Don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!

442
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,402
他们给我400买头
They gave me 400 for his head.

443
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,584
你呆这儿，我去找找看
You stay put. I'm going to look for parts.

444
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,721
我跟你一起去，那饮料难喝死了
I'm coming with you. That drink has my heart pounding.

445
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,959
让我自己呆在车里脑子会炸的
If I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.

446
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,659
随便了，自己跟上
Whatever. Just keep up.

447
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,677
靠
Crap.

448
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,079
靠后
Stay back.

449
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,589
好了，走
All right, keep up.

450
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,726
探照灯是自动的，要把握好时机
These searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right,

451
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:04,892
跟紧了
so stay close.

452
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,764
好了
It's all right.

453
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,172
快点，快点
Come on, come on.

454
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,679
会被抓的 快点
- We're going to get caught. - Come on.

455
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:19,514
别担心，别担心
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

456
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,814
快点，从这儿下去，走
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

457
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,656
机器人在东边，我们要很快去那
Robots are on the east side. We got to be quick in here.

458
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,920
过了这儿就没有探照灯了，快，走
Once we're through here, there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

459
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,780
到了 我们在找什么
- Here it is. - What are we looking for?

460
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:55,511
找一切可以把机器人组装起的东西
Anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.

461
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,644
看 怎么了
- Hey, look. - What?

462
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,781
好小哦
It's so small.

463
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,621
你出生前就有的了
Yeah. That's before your time.

464
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:06,821
第一代，最早的战斗机器人
That's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.

465
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,128
他们想把它做得更像人，越像越好
They wanted them to look like us. The more human, the better.

466
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,032
时过境迁，把那放车里
Crazy how quick everything changed. Put that in the cart.

467
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,265
什么变了 好问题，人类拳击
- What changed? - A good question. Human boxing.

468
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,542
慢慢就没了 为什么
- It just faded. - Why?

469
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,874
因为钱，人们想看更多大屠杀，更多表演
Because the money moved on. People wanted more carnage, more show.

470
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,075
巴西地下格斗场有Gracies和Machados
You had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados,

471
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:30,551
jiu-jitsu， Muay Thai和上千种款式
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and a thousand styles in between.

472
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:31,985
各种各样，到处都是
Full-on ground-and-pound.

473
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,317
这个 这是什么
- Look at this. - What's that?

474
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,784
不知道
I don't know.

475
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,154
不错，好发现
Not bad. Good spot.

476
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,291
还是有像人的拳击手，有人的身体
You still had human fighters, human bodies,

477
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,827
你永远满足不了人类
so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:

478
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,196
无拘无束的暴力
True, no-holds-barred violence.

479
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,031
下一步就是
The next logical step,

480
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,267
让人类原来那个舞台，让机器自相残杀
get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.

481
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,767
你怀念吗？
Do you miss it?

482
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,774
拳击，你怀念吗？ 小心
- Boxing. Do you miss it? - Careful.

483
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,317
什么？我想知道
What? I want to know.

484
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,179
小心，你在悬崖边
Careful, you're on a cliff.

485
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,893
很高呢 要是掉下去了，肯定会
That's a long way down. If you fell, you'd definitely...

486
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,662
Charlie救我
Charlie, help me!

487
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,264
Charlie!

488
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,330
- Charlie! - Max! Max!

489
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,295
Max!

490
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,837
别动 我好像在机器人手臂上
- Try not to move! - I'm on some sort of robot arm.

491
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,973
等等，别怕，把手给我，好的
Wait! Just easy, easy. Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

492
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:10,417
慢慢的，好样的，别往下看，看着我
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down. Look at me. Look at me.

493
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,418
好了，我抓到你了，别怕，我抓到你了
That's it! I've got you! You don't have to be scared. I got you!

494
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,023
太远了 没事的，我抓到你了
- It's so far! - It's OK. I got you.

495
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,425
慢慢的把手给我，好的
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

496
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:25,090
把另一只手也给我，慢慢的吗，碰到了，加油没抓到了
Just give me your other hand very slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

497
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,830
看着我，我们一起
Look at me. We're going to do this together.

498
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,135
你和我，你只要看着我就好
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

499
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:35,701
1 2 3 
One... two... three!

500
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:43,015
好了，我抓到你了，抓到了，抓到了
That's it. I got you! I got you. I got you. I got you.

501
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,922
安全了，没事了
You're safe. You're safe.

502
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,130
好了，抓住你了
All right, I got you.

503
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,792
还好吧 恩
- You all right? - Yeah.

504
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:01,302
过来，放松
Come here. Easy. Easy.

505
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,438
没事吧
You all right?

506
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,073
没事吧 - Yeah.没事
- You all right? - Yeah.

507
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:08,110
我说过很危险的
I told you it was dangerous.

508
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,436
小心点，我们还在悬崖边
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

509
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,454
Charlie，这里有一整个机器人
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.

510
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,026
那又怎么样，走啦
So what? Let's go. Come on.

511
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,766
我要把他带走，他救了我
I'm taking him with me. He saved my life.

512
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,201
他没救你，是我救了你，走啦
He did not save your life. I saved your life. Let's go.

513
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:37,296
把车推到悬崖边，我用绞车把他拉出去
Just bring the cart to the edge. I'll use the winch to get him out.

514
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,935
你要捡垃圾？要捡自己捡，我要走了
You want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.

515
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,541
这就是Noisy Boy剩下的？
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

516
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:28,875
就这些
That's it.

517
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,546
他的头给碰撞宫殿门口做了很好的装饰
His head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.

518
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,919
这不好笑 我们做个机器人，你和我
- It's not funny. - Let's get a robot, you and me.

519
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:39,154
好想法，你毁了一切
Good idea. You're broke. I'm almost there myself.

520
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,130
你失去了最好的机会 我们会再做一个
- You destroyed the best shot you had. - We'll put one together.

521
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,460
你很擅长这个，东西都在这儿了
You're brilliant at this. There's good stuff here.

522
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,899
这儿什么也没有 这里啊，看
- There's nothing here. - There is. Look.

523
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,972
这些废物，都是废物
All your junk is... it's junk.

524
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,168
你早就出局了
You're not even in the game anymore.

525
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,211
都是垃圾 我听见了，都是垃圾
- It's all garbage. - I heard you. It's garbage.

526
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,075
别跟我吼
Don't get loud with me.

527
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,081
是你自己的问题 什么意思
- You're your problem. - What's that supposed to mean?

528
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,084
我在这儿陪你带了够长的时间了
I have been here for you a long time.

529
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,952
比赛的时候，不比赛的时候，我厌倦了
In the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

530
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:10,117
我父亲为你的事业投资了一切，我们爱……
My father invested everything he had in your fight career. We loved...

531
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:16,463
他乡家人一样爱你，这是他的家
He loved you like family. And this is his home.

532
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,931
我只是维持不让这里倒下，我就是我的计划
I'm just trying not to let it die. That's my plan.

533
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,502
你的计划是什么？
What's yours?

534
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,046
什么都玩完儿了，是么？
You're done, right?

535
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:40,988
结束了么？因为我想结束了，Charlie
You're finally done? Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

536
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,525
我一无所有
I got nothing left.

537
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:46,586
好吧
All right.

538
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,929
也许那边那个
Maybe there's something here.

539
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,071
那孩子昨晚拉来的机器人，能帮我看看吗？
This robot the kid brought in last night. Would you look at it for me?

540
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,631
拜托
Please?

541
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:11,249
我从没见过这种东西，他是二代，但是很罕见
I've never seen anything like it before. He's Generation Two, but barely.

542
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:16,019
我找到了适合他的电池，帮他配上了老式的G2远程控制
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

543
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,253
他可以动，但几乎是垃圾
You can move him around, but he's crap.

544
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,297
也许我可以给他找些保护条，赚点钱
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.

545
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,592
停
Stop.

546
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,394
是我的机器人
It's my robot!

547
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,198
我花了半晚上把他拖出来，它是我的
It took me half the night dragging him out of there. He's mine.

548
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,968
是你的？但是他身体里面的零件是我的
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts we're putting in him are mine!

549
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,542
你们两个白痴为他打架前看看他能不能启动
You idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.

550
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,114
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

551
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,467
当心，退后
Watch out. Stay back.

552
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,054
她有模仿功能，真少见
Looks like he's got a shadow function. That's pretty rare.

553
00:44:20,757 --> 00:44:23,225
他可以模拟行动然后储存记忆
He can mime your movements and store them in memory.

554
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,194
能用的多吗 不多
- Is there anything here we could use? - Not much.

555
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,354
有个桶
There's a bucket...

556
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,725
有个我洗车的桶
There's a bucket I use to wash the truck.

557
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,730
打扫下，一股垃圾味
Use it and clean him up. He smells like crap.

558
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:36,733
也洗洗你自己，和他呆一起你也臭了
Wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.

559
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,203
我把它调成远程控制，很简单的
I switched him to remote. It's pretty basic.

560
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,608
用触发器控制他，让他走
Just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.

561
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,214
你玩游戏吧？ 是的
- You play video games, right? - Of course.

562
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,149
一样的，这就是个1000磅机器人
Same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.

563
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,710
太棒了
Cool.

564
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,519
原子
"Atom."

565
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:37,266
他叫Atom，可以让他打架吗
His name is Atom. Can we get him a fight?

566
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,664
我想他不是个拳击机器人
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.

567
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,796
是G2型号，2014年产的 他是拳击机器人
He's a G-2, built in early 2014. He was a sparring bot.

568
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:44,368
肯定制造过这样的机器人
They must have built robots like this one

569
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,533
可以模仿其他机器人的战斗模式
that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.

570
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,804
那可以让他打一场吗
OK, so can we get him a fight?

571
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,603
你没在听吗？他是拳击机器人
Are you not listening? He's a sparring bot.

572
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,411
可能会出击，但是不会有什么大的破坏力
Built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.

573
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,179
你可以把它拆了卖了
You could always sell him off for parts.

574
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,653
可以让他打一场吗？ 可以让他打一场吗？
- Can't you get him a fight? - "Why can't you get him a fight?"

575
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,553
不到黄河心不死，是吧
God, you don't quit, do you?

576
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,593
你想让他参加拳击比赛被打散架吗？
You want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

577
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:07,629
我看出来你在碰撞宫殿的时候下坏了
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.

578
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:11,895
你用这个机器人打一定会吓得尿裤子的
The places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your pants.

579
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,466
好啊，让他打一场
Excellent. Get him a fight.

580
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,601
顽固的死小孩
Stubborn kid.

581
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,611
惊喜，惊喜
Surprise, surprise.

582
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,345
走走吧
Let's take a walk.

583
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,450
你听得懂我吗？
Can you understand me?

584
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,565
别担心，你的秘密我不会说出去的
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

585
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,426
你认识Charlie很久了
You've known Charlie a long time.

586
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,765
太久了，我们都在这个体育馆长大
Too long. We both kind of grew up in this gym.

587
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,002
我父亲训练他的
My dad, he trained him.

588
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,874
那是他们，那个是Charlie
That's them. That's Charlie.

589
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,437
他喜欢当拳击手吗？
- What was he like? - As a boxer?

590
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,743
他什么都喜欢当 他很厉害
- As anything. - He was something.

591
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,581
他瘦，但是强壮
He was lean, tough.

592
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,587
无所畏惧，决不放弃
No quit, no fear.

593
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,019
来给你看点东西
Come here. I want to show you something.

594
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:31,895
我有2007年 Phoenix的这篇文章
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007

595
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,768
Charlie战最强竞争者Nico Tandy
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.

596
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,396
你看了Nico Tandy的比赛？
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

597
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:41,500
是啊，本来应该是Charlie的热身赛，应该赢得很轻松
I was. Charlie was supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

598
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,910
打败Nico根本不费吹灰之力
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat, but...

599
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:50,551
但没人跟 Charlie说过，他一直逼近他
...nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.

600
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,951
看这个
Check this out.

601
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,117
那是 Charlie
That's Charlie.

602
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,724
一开始Nico不相信这个无名小卒那么厉害
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.

603
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:05,529
但 Charlie一直在逼近， Nico就害怕了
But Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.

604
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,466
真的？ 真的
- Really? - Really.

605
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,128
他完全在耍 Nico
He was toying with Nico.

606
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,930
最强挑战者，世界第二
The top contender, number two in the world,

607
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,101
Charlie再和他跳舞
and Charlie was dancing with him.

608
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,939
Charlie那晚厉害得不得了
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.

609
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,950
像又幽灵一样，Nico根本看不清他
He was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.

610
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:24,751
但我看得清
I could.

611
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,754
他的姿势太美了
He was beautiful.

612
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,123
太美了
He was beautiful.

613
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,831
然后呢？Charlie打败 Nico Tandy了吗？
So what happened? Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

614
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,699
不在第十二局的时候被Nico Tandy打中了，两次
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.

615
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,669
两次，然后灯就亮了
Second time for good. Lights out.

616
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:44,069
你得分高
You were ahead on the scorecards

617
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,501
地第2局的时候 Nico Tandy赢了
- going into the 12th round. - Nico Tandy rung my bell

618
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:49,510
然后连续三年蝉联不败冠军
and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.

619
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:51,637
他打败你了？ 是啊，打败了好多人
- He knocked you out? - Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

620
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,045
你也打败了好多人
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

621
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:57,609
24和19，不算什么 但每次都赢
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career. - But every fight a knockout.

622
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,120
是啊 输或赢，
- Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over

623
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:00,889
直到把人打趴下比赛才结束
- till someone's on the mat. - Till someone's on the mat.

624
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,515
你爸教的 该死，他居然教你这个
- Your old man taught me that. - Damn straight he taught you that.

625
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:05,753
你还跟谁打过 收拾东西去
- Who else did you fight? - Go get your stuff together.

626
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,796
不需要 为了冠军而战吗？
I don't need to. Did you fight for the title?

627
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:11,458
是的，一个小时后出发
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

628
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,126
Wow. Here.

629
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,597
加油
Keep it.

630
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,435
谢了 不客气
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

631
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,745
我喜欢这孩子
I like that kid.

632
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,947
他也喜欢你
He likes you.

633
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:37,484
昨天我说的话 什么也别说了
- What I said yesterday was... - No, nothing more to say.

634
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,720
我今晚去Atlanta
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

635
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:44,027
看看能不能找到合伙人筹钱买个新机器人
to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.

636
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:49,071
这就是你想要的对吧，我走就是了
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

637
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:55,677
是的，这就是我想要的
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

638
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,077
OK.

639
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,250
看
Look.

640
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:52,160
冠军在这，Zeus在这
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

641
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:53,895
是的
Yeah.

642
00:52:55,939 --> 00:53:01,377
Zeus！这怪物两局之内战无不胜，两局
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster. Two rounds!

643
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,739
他是今晚的世界钢铁拳王
The champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.

644
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,839
他胜券在握
He just may have a real fight on his hands.

645
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:12,252
Zeus最伟大的拳击机器人，没有之一。比赛结束，各位晚安
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever. End of story. Good night!

646
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,717
太棒了，棒极了 什么
- So cool. It's so cool. - What?

647
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,852
来
Come on.

648
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:24,824
听好了，我去找Finn
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

649
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,731
你呆在这儿
I want you to stay in this area.

650
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,872
让开，冠军要过去Zeus 要过去
Out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.

651
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,601
让开让开，冠军来了
Move, move. Champ coming through.

652
00:53:44,787 --> 00:53:47,915
Farra Lemkova，Zeus父亲/女儿团队的幕后女儿
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father/daughter Zeus team.

653
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,687
传言说你父亲为Zeus出钱，但你才是真正的军师
They say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.

654
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,685
您真客气
You're very kind,

655
00:53:53,796 --> 00:53:57,732
但真正的军师是 Tak Mashido
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

656
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:02,335
是什么吸引了这位天才，前任男孩奇迹
What did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

657
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,802
也是最受争论的最重要的机器人设计师
and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport

658
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,342
是什么让他重出江湖
out of retirement?

659
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,769
干嘛不问他本人呢
Why don't you ask him yourself?

660
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,177
这是 Tak Mashido最伟大的作品吗？
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

661
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:23,883
Zeus在战斗中完全自主，他也一直在进化
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.

662
00:54:23,993 --> 00:54:26,018
带着适应力很强的系统
With his adaptive operating system,

663
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:31,089
他识别机型然后立即写出战斗编码
he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.

664
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,797
那您是说Zeus?
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus?

665
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:40,171
我说，不论遇到什么情况
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring...

666
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:44,377
比赛的结局永远不会改变
...the result of any fight is inevitable.

667
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,172
Zeus人挡杀人，佛挡杀佛
What Zeus sees...

668
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:50,048
...he kills.

669
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:53,212
厉害
Sweet.

670
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,785
我不会和你合作的
I'm never going into business with you.

671
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:25,114
我要休息下
I just need a break here.

672
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,985
把那个老式机器垃圾带出去，你老带些垃圾来
You got that old bot truck out there. You always got something in there.

673
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,685
我有个老式拳击机器人，分文不值
I got an old sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.

674
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:32,260
我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do with that?

675
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,126
去动物园，带他去动物园。 他们明天在这儿打
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo. They fight there tomorrow.

676
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,256
我不会死在动物园的
Even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.

677
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,267
我只是需要贷款
I just need a little loan.

678
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,930
什么？
What?

679
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:44,805
你在开玩笑吧， Charlie 贷款
- You're serious, Charlie? - A loan.

680
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:47,068
几百块，你有多少给多少就行
Couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.

681
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,703
你知道我人好
You know I'm good for it.

682
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:53,441
我了解你，我也很喜欢你，伙计
I know you, and as much as I like you, dude...

683
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,311
你是个很糟糕的赌注，兄弟
...you're a bad bet, brother.

684
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,315
对，是啊
Right, yeah.

685
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,902
看到没，那是Axelrod的残骸
Did you see that? That's what's left of Axelrod.

686
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,878
你去哪儿了，我告诉过你不要乱跑
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

687
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,212
你没看见Zeus太帅了
You should have seen him. Zeus was, like, amazing!

688
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:30,308
帅，是么？ 简直不可思议
- Amazing, huh? - Unbelievable, yeah.

689
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,754
他把Axelrod一顿乱揍，太快了，不可思议啊
He was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

690
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:38,315
Axelrod一拳也没打到他，连第一局也没撑过
Axelrod didn't even land a punch. He didn't even survive the first round.

691
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,520
你认为拳击就是那样？
Is that what you think boxing is?

692
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,854
Zeus打败了些破铜烂铁
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?

693
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:44,865
Axelrod不是破铜烂铁，他是拳击机器人
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel. And that is what boxing is now.

694
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:47,435
太棒了，我爱死他了，我乐在其中
Deal with it. And I love it, and I'm in it now.

695
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,763
你乐在其中？你和你的G2机器人
You're in it now, are you? You and your G-2 sparring bot?

696
00:56:50,873 --> 00:56:54,206
G2比那个更厉害，如果你让我们比赛你就会知道的
He's more than that. If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

697
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,336
你运气好了，有个美妙的地方叫动物园
You're in luck, kid. There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

698
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,210
明天下午，你可以战一场
Tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.

699
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,783
太好了 这也是最后一场
- Great. - And it will be the end.

700
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,116
我说过我讨厌汉堡
I told you I hate hamburgers!

701
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,118
是玉米煎饼
It's a burrito!

702
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,795
右上勾拳
Right uppercut.

703
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,170
左上勾拳
Left uppercut.

704
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,812
蹲下双手向上
Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

705
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:38,044
再来一次，蹲下双手向上
Again. Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

706
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,384
一晚没睡？
You been up all night?

707
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,014
是啊，我把它弄干净了
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

708
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,424
我用影子模式设计了战斗移动，然后同步到了远程里
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.

709
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,964
恩，我看到了你示范的连续猛击
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.

710
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,260
那是致命的
That's lethal stuff.

711
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,527
来做这个
Let's do this.

712
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,828
先做早餐
Let's do breakfast first.

713
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,043
你知道你会带着破破烂烂的他回家对吗？
You know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?

714
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,339
走着瞧
We'll see.

715
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:49,457
交给我吧 我是Charlie Kenton这是 Max
- Let me deal with this. - Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

716
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,390
Kingpin叫我 Kingpin
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

717
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,088
好吧 Kingpin，这个…… 一局多少
- All right, Kingpin, so... - How much a round?

718
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,892
不是练习吗
We on a field trip?

719
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,467
好吧，他和我的 Metro打
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

720
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,367
一百一局，两分钟
I'll give you a hundred bucks for one two-minute round.

721
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,904
成交吧 三百
- Take it. - Three hundred.

722
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:07,498
一百，宝贝儿，给你一百让你和 Metro打
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

723
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,275
五百两局怎么样
How about 500 for two rounds?

724
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,946
两局？他一局都熬不过
Two rounds. Son, he ain't going to survive one round.

725
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,485
要是熬过了呢 不可能
- What if he does? - He ain't.

726
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,212
要是他行呢！
Let's just say he does.

727
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,389
要是一局没倒下
If he's still standing after one round...

728
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,090
给你一千块
...I'll give you a thousand bucks.

729
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,289
闭嘴
Shut it!

730
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,635
要是他挂了，少年
But if he dies in there, which he will, junior...

731
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,009
我要他的尸体
...I get to keep what's left.

732
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:44,011
选一百的
Take the hundred.

733
00:59:44,513 --> 00:59:45,571
成交
Deal.

734
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,246
来吧，我们上
We're on. We on!

735
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,545
走吧
Let's go!

736
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,022
你应该选一百的 我会赚一千
- You should have taken the hundred. - I got us a thousand.

737
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,422
是啊，除非他赢了
Yeah, if he wins.

738
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,685
要我操作吗
You want me to drive?

739
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:26,420
是我的机器人，我来
He's my bot. I got this!

740
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:29,719
这不是打游戏，是来真的
This ain't a video game. This is for real. Right here.

741
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:33,189
你说他会变成破烂，要是没有呢
You said he's coming home in pieces. What difference does it make?

742
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,456
好吧
All right.

743
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,524
我要上了
I got this.

744
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,033
要上了，要上了
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

745
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,697
像香港乒乓球队那样上吧
Let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

746
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,566
给个铃，给个铃
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

747
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,146
别看 Atom看你的对手
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

748
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,487
看脚，他踩你了
Watch out for that foot. He's looking to pin you.

749
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,455
我说了让你看脚的
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.

750
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,027
他的大锤来了
Here comes the sledgehammer.

751
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,232
看到没
Did you see that?

752
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,605
上啊，干掉他 别对他叫，控制他
- Come on! Get him! - Don't yell at him, control him.

753
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,610
向右，退后
Slip right. Back step.

754
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,505
躲开
Duck.

755
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,081
不客气 闭嘴，你什么忙也帮不上
- You're welcome. - Shut up! You're not helping!

756
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,207
我可帮了大忙
Actually, I think I am.

757
01:01:29,618 --> 01:01:34,453
反手击，快点，别停
Backhand. You got speed on this guy. Just keep moving. Bob.

758
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:43,095
离开角落，别听，跳着迂回前进
Slip out of that corner. Keep moving! Bob and weave!

759
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:47,229
就这样，现在，听我指挥
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

760
01:01:57,279 --> 01:02:00,476
它能承受这一击，你的机器人可以承受
He can take a hit. I'll give you this. Your bot can take a hit.

761
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:05,383
最好赶紧脱离，不然死的很难看
You better slip that headlock. This ain't gonna end well for you.

762
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,512
我正在
I'm trying!

763
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:15,456
30秒
Thirty seconds!

764
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,596
30……半分钟
Thirty... Half a minute.

765
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:22,330
半分钟，动起来，别停
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

766
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,237
你有20秒
You've got 20 seconds!

767
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,274
一千块呢，20秒，结果了他
That's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

768
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,139
动啊 动啊
Move, then. Move!

769
01:02:40,222 --> 01:02:41,553
块
Come on.

770
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,591
起来Atom，起来Atom
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

771
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,263
一起倒数，一起倒数
Count with me! Count with me! One!

772
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,561
起来 你在和机器说话？
- Get up! - You know you're talking to a machine?

773
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,192
Four! Five! Six!

774
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,702
起来Atom
Get up, Atom!

775
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,330
冲啊冲啊
All the way up! All the way up!

776
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:02,776
好样的 好样的
Yes! Yes!

777
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,181
我要修理他
I'm going to fix it!

778
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,186
我要修理他
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

779
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,688
这一千块 是的一千
- This thousand bucks... - Yeah, thousand.

780
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,621
双倍还是什么也不要 他来不了另外一局了
...double or nothing he can't make another round.

781
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:18,420
谢了 成交，双倍还是一无所有
- Yeah, thanks anyway. - Deal. Double or nothing.

782
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,859
男孩成交，继续战斗
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

783
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:23,461
疯了吗？你刚丢了一千
Are you crazy? You threw away a thousand bucks!

784
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,591
他都站不稳了
He can barely stand up in there.

785
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,397
我真的很需要钱
Look. I really need the money.

786
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,739
我知道，会成功的
I know. Let's work.

787
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,500
天啊
Jesus.

788
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:42,275
看，看 我成功了
- Watch that. Watch that. - I got that.

789
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,922
成功了 系统失败了
- I got it. - That's a system failure!

790
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,365
失败了 他倒下了
- I don't got it. - He's going down.

791
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,968
好 不
- Yes! - No!

792
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:11,736
倒数
Start the count!

793
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:13,246
倒数啊
Start the count!

794
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,785
One! Two! Three!

795
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:20,913
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

796
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:22,918
Eight! Nine!

797
01:04:23,225 --> 01:04:24,249
Ten!

798
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,594
你做到了，我们成功了
You did it! We did it! Wow!

799
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,498
走吧 带上你的机器人
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

800
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:41,265
我知道！我知道！
I know, I know! I know! I know!

801
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,901
Kingpin付钱
Kingpin, pay up.

802
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,272
耶，耶，耶，我知道了，我知道了
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.

803
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,748
-我们赢了！-我们走。赶紧，赶紧
- We owned! - Let's go. Come on, come on.

804
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:51,816
-有空么？-我这里有场比赛给你。
- Yeah? - Have I got a fight for you.

805
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:56,517
周六晚上，四千英镑保底。赢了七千。
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand. Seven if he wins.

806
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,559
四千？好。我们走
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

807
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:11,033
Bailey，那是我的。他赢的。
Bailey, it's me. He won.

808
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:14,435
你能相信么？那孩子的机器人赢了。
Can you believe that? The kid's robot actually won.

809
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,539
我知道。
I know.

810
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,275
高兴么？我的天啊。耶
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

811
01:05:22,384 --> 01:05:24,750
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

812
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:29,581
无论如何。。。
Anyway...

813
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,590
我只想让你知道。
I just wanted you to know.

814
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,463
猛击，猛击。上勾拳
Jab, jab, hook.

815
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:14,663
猛击，猛击。上勾拳
Jab, jab, hook.

816
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,369
我认为你最好注意下脚步
I think you have to move your feet.

817
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:25,904
你的脚，脚
Your feet. Feet.

818
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,193
很好，孩子
Nice moves, kid.

819
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,862
你在外面多久了？
How long you been out here?

820
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,427
来看看
Check it out.

821
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:55,833
我花了一晚上时间弄的
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.

822
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,872
太惊奇了。如果可以的话，你懂的？
Incredibly amazing. If it works, you know?

823
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,937
你知道他的遥控器是坏的？-是的
- You know his remote was spotty? - Yeah.

824
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,137
我把他给拆了，我们再也不需要他了
I killed it. Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore.

825
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:05,606
你怎么？
How did you?

826
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,979
我不得不重新开始。
I had to start over.

827
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,779
但是我可以把Ambush的零件
But I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush

828
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,548
装在 Noisy Boy身上
and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy,

829
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:14,713
而且成功了
and it works.

830
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:17,917
完全有效，绝对可以。
He knows nothing, but it works. It really, really works.

831
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:19,118
怎么样？
What works?

832
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,026
我打开它
I got to turn it on.

833
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,133
左勾拳，上勾拳
Left jab, right uppercut!

834
01:08:28,203 --> 01:08:29,227
日本！
Japan!

835
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,006
你弄好了语音识别系统？
You put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?

836
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:34,200
-太聪明了，孩子。-聪明？
- Pretty smart, kid. - Smart?

837
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,772
我TMD就是个天才！
It could be genius!

838
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,642
这绝对是人类历史上最不可思议的事情。
It could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!

839
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:41,773
你把所有苏打水喝光了？
Easy there, chief. Did you drink all these sodas?

840
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,944
我可能还有点。我需要你教它打拳
I might have had a few. I need you to teach him to box.

841
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:49,080
你开玩笑吧？它是老式机器人不适合的
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

842
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,489
所以他需要你教它
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

843
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,027
从零开始。忘了吧
- Start over from the ground up. - Forget it.

844
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:55,926
你是个拳击手。
You were a boxer.

845
01:08:56,031 --> 01:09:00,627
昨天在动物园，你看到它行的
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.

846
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,966
我已经很久没打拳了，而且再也不会打了
I haven't boxed in a long time. I'm not starting now.

847
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,631
那谁教它呢？-你就可以了
- Who's going to teach him to fight? - You're doing fine.

848
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,641
你不需要我的，抱歉
You don't need me. Sorry.

849
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,939
这舞蹈太帅了！
That was really cool, though, that dance.

850
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,047
你可以在周六晚上跳
You should do that on Saturday night.

851
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,947
别嘲笑我。-我说真的
- Don't make fun of me. - I'm serious.

852
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,888
开打的铃声响起前，你可以表演下
Before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.

853
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:26,222
我绝不在一堆看拳击塞的观众面前和一个机器人跳
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.

854
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:29,725
你开玩笑么？这是一场表演
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

855
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,993
人们就是喜欢这些没见过的新鲜玩意
People want to see something they've never seen.

856
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,796
看。你可以看看所有牛B人物
Look. You think of all the greats.

857
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:37,701
拳王阿里, 甜心合唱团
Think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer,

858
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,603
他们都有他的别名
they all had their nicknames.

859
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,734
他们都有他们的私人特点
They had their personas. They all had flair.

860
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:47,248
你呢？你没有太多的机器人，但是你有一个会跳舞的机器人
Now you? You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.

861
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:50,814
加上你是个孩子，人们会喜欢你的
Plus, you're a kid. People love that kid thing.

862
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:53,717
你多大？9岁，10岁？我11了！
- What are you? Like nine? Ten? - I'm 11.

863
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,585
你确定你11了？
Are you sure you're 11?

864
01:09:56,558 --> 01:09:58,822
当然。
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

865
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:03,125
好吧，重点是人们喜欢你那样
Anyway, the point is people want to see that.

866
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,732
你没骗我吧？
You're really not messing with me?

867
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,169
没有，人们肯定喜欢你的
I am not messing with you. They're going to love it.

868
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,170
好的。但是
- Cool. - But...

869
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:19,304
怎么了？你不帮我的话，我不会跳的
- What? - I won't do it unless you help me.

870
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,581
我不会跳舞，你自己就可以了
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

871
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:25,277
我是指拳击
No. Boxing.

872
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:26,884
好吧，我明白了。我给机器人设置程序
- Oh, I see. - I program the robot.

873
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:29,150
你教它拳击。你来跳舞
- You teach him to box. - And you dance.

874
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,748
你跳舞
And you dance.

875
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,155
好的。好的？
- Yeah. - Yeah?

876
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,287
成交。
Deal.

877
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,624
成交。
Deal.

878
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,067
绝对酷毙了！
It's going to be cool.

879
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,324
牛B
Nice.

880
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,063
你将要面对大家伙。向上挥拳
You're going to be punching guys bigger. You're going to have to punch up.

881
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,958
对了
That's it.

882
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,059
很好
Nice.

883
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,107
你也是，老男人
You, too, old man?

884
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,112
赶紧，让我们开始正事吧
Come on. Let's get to work.

885
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,975
很好！再来一次
Nice! Let's do that again.

886
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,846
很好，三连击。
Nice. Three-punch combo.

887
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,247
继续
Combo.

888
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,059
再来。
Again. Again.

889
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,690
快点，快点，很好
Faster. Faster. Nice.

890
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,294
你都不用喘气的，我喜欢。
You're not even out of breath. I like it.

891
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:22,366
让我们看看你步伐如何
Let's see how you move.

892
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,402
很好
That's good.

893
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:08,874
向前一步。左勾拳！左勾拳
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

894
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,201
对了。
That's it. Every time.

895
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,770
向上
Upper cut!

896
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:46,550
很好，伙计！
Great fight, fellas.

897
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:58,126
105.5, WRUT,机器人拳击厅
105.5, WRUT, the satellite home of robot boxing.

898
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,996
两位，你们给我带来了什么呢？
Caller two, what do you got for me?

899
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,229
你听说过那个小机器人么
Have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?

900
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,361
是的
Oh, yeah.

901
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,100
我跟我的伙伴那天晚上看到他在跳舞
My buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.

902
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,176
跳舞？是的
- Did you say "dances"? - You heard me.

903
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:10,403
他和那个小男孩有一场赛前表演
He dances pre-fight with this little kid,

904
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,070
观众们都为他俩发狂了
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

905
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,013
你先把那骗人的玩意放一边去
You put the gimmick aside for a second,

906
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,585
我刚拿到这个机器人打败过的名单
and I'm holding here a list of the bots he's beaten.

907
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:22,380
Chaos.Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack，这些被他干掉的机器人都挺强的么
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack. No slouches on that list, right?

908
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,322
这矮个机器人把他们全打败了
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

909
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:28,556
这家伙速度很快，他避开了大家伙的攻击。
This bot is fast! He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!

910
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,856
毫无疑问。我来告诉你，听好了，记住这个名字
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners, remember this name:

911
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:36,836
Atom.对，A-T-O-M.
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M. This bot is one to watch.

912
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,375
可怕的攻击。谢谢，谢谢
- Awesome fight, sir. - Thanks, thanks.

913
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:46,276
打的很好。
Great fight.

914
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,008
打的太精彩了。谢谢
- You guys put on a good show. - Thanks.

915
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,050
我们像邀请你为我们打场比赛
We'd like to invite you to fight on our card,

916
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,211
周五晚上，底特律的赛场
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit, Friday night.

917
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,881
对了，就是WRB联赛
Right. That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

918
01:14:55,991 --> 01:15:00,052
太牛B了，你觉得如何，准备好这场比赛了么？
Damn right it is. What do you say, fellas? You ready for the show?

919
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:03,063
见鬼
Heck, yeah.

920
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,565
虽然是邀请赛，但仍然是联盟赛呢
It's the undercard, but it's still a League fight.

921
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,570
我只需要你放松下，你要放松，别紧张
I just want you to be relaxed. I want you to be relaxed.

922
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,576
别怕，没有任何东西能难到我们
No freaking out. Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

923
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:24,078
如果你怕了，所有的东西都会没了
You go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.

924
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:28,054
不管你做什么，一定要高兴，高兴，明白么？
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun. You got to have fun, you understand me?

925
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:32,183
我们走这么远来这里就是为了克服一切困难
We've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.

926
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:35,593
我们就是来玩的，搞定一切
We're going to have fun, and we're going to not freak out!

927
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:39,230
我们就算是输了，我们也要去
We're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.

928
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:42,599
我一生都在为了这里，我们要。。
I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...

929
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:47,269
我跟你说过什么。当我说不要怕的时候相信我，明白么
I tell you what. Trust me when I say no freaking out. You got it?

930
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,201
了解。很好
- I got it. - Good.

931
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:55,178
你被邀请去见Lemkova Suite，请跟我来
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite. Follow me, please.

932
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,913
谁？再说一次
What was that? One more time.

933
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,453
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

934
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:04,057
当然，让我们去冠军的屋里。
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up to the champ's suite. Sure.

935
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:34,613
哇
Wow.

936
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,723
先生，我是Farra Lemkova。你好，我是Charlie Kenton,
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova. - Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

937
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,018
当然，这是Tak Mashido
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

938
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,393
太牛B了，它是Tak Mashido
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

939
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:47,630
我知道你今天晚上有场重要的比赛，所以我特地过来。
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.

940
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,372
虽然我不好这口，但是我喜欢
It's a little far from the action for my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

941
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:55,409
很好，哇。非常棒
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

942
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,671
看那个。想来个合影么？介意么？
Look at that. You want an autograph? Would you mind?

943
01:16:57,979 --> 01:16:59,708
我想买下你的机器人
I'd like to buy your robot.

944
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,350
他可以做Zeus的陪练机器人。而且我会付钱的
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus. And for that I'm willing to pay.

945
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,483
$200,000.

946
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,150
成交。-他不是拿来卖的
- Done. - He's not for sale.

947
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,990
当然，它是，我们很确定。。-他不卖的
- Of course he is. We can definitely... - He's not for sale.

948
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:20,591
离比赛还有15分钟
You are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities,

949
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,636
你们将要面对一个非常凶残的机器人
a vicious League bot.

950
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:28,175
所以，想清楚，一旦比赛铃声响起，你的机器人就成一堆废铁了
So, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.

951
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:32,440
我们很清楚，不卖的
OK. And just to be clear, he's not for sale!

952
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,674
现在不卖，永远不卖
Not now, not ever.

953
01:17:36,017 --> 01:17:38,178
给你一分钟时间考虑
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

954
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,178
Tak,怎么样？Max!
Tak, how are you? Max!

955
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,616
聪明点，我知道你爱他
Be smart. I know you love him,

956
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,321
但是20分钟后，可能什么也剩不下来了
but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.

957
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,524
好好考虑下。接受这笔交易。你好好考虑下。
- Think about it. Take the offer. - You think about it.

958
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,759
他为什么要买？因为他和其他机器人不同
Why does she want Atom? Because he's different from other bots!

959
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,039
是的，他不同。他更小，更弱
Yeah, he's different. He's smaller, weaker,

960
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:00,266
而且他将被其他机器人干掉。-他是个拳击手
- and he's going to get his ass kicked. - He's a boxer.

961
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,672
我们教它打拳。是你教它打拳
We taught him to box. You taught him to box!

962
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,379
他值得的。我也这么认为
- That's worth something. - I think it is, too.

963
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,143
我认为他值得20万美元
I think it's worth 200 grand. Two hundred grand.

964
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:12,219
我们可以干很多事情
We can go round and round this all night long.

965
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,617
看着我
Look at me.

966
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,320
绝对不可能的
But it's not going to happen.

967
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,756
我有场比赛
I got a fight to get to.

968
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:37,310
女士们和先生们，今晚
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

969
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:42,179
欢迎来到底特律观看
the march towards the Real Steel Championship

970
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:45,343
锦标赛前的热身赛
makes its way through Detroit's

971
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:49,514
由美国Virgin集团赞助!
Virgin America Spectrum!

972
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:57,829
首先上场的是
Kicking off the evening, in our first undercard,

973
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,863
来自双子城的
the two-headed tyrant,

974
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:05,401
“双头暴君”
Twin Cities!

975
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:41,140
他的对手是头一次参加专业联赛的
Opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight,

976
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:44,700
无名小卒
hailing from parts unknown,

977
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,576
Atom!

978
01:20:42,303 --> 01:20:43,702
很好，老板。谢谢
- Nice work, boss. - Thanks.

979
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,670
你把他调到战斗模式了么？是的
- Did you switch him to fight mode? - Of course.

980
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:48,537
这家伙很难对付。Atom 可以的
- This bot is tough to put down. - Atom can do it.

981
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,537
看按。你看到那些控制台傍边的人了么
Look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

982
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,444
他们控制他们的机器人做各种动作
They're controlling everything their bot does.

983
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,709
他们监视他的整个系统
They're monitoring his systems,

984
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:58,411
注意观察
seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights.

985
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,579
这可不像那些地下比赛
This is not like the underground handheld remote bots

986
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:02,588
我们要开打了，这可是联赛，站在那
we've been fighting. This is the League. Stand on that.

987
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,658
我们做什么呢
So what do we do?

988
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:08,918
我们要聪明点，耐心点，祈祷吧
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

989
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,295
认真祈祷吧
Seriously, pray.

990
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:15,793
准备！
Ready!

991
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,803
准备，举起手来
- Ready! - Hands up.

992
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:21,341
准备，打！

994
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:32,646
右边!后面。右边，左边，遮挡
Slip! Right! Lean back. Right, left! Cover up!

995

闪避，左边

996
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,395
该死
Damn it.

01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:52,401
左边，右边！遮挡
Lean left! Lean right! Cover up! Cover up!

998
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,442
你在那干嘛？他挨了太多下了
- What's going on in there? - He's taking too many hits.

999
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:02,577
举起手！
Get your hands up!

1000
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,318
离开角落。快！
Get out of that corner! Move!

1001
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,724
在那儿会被杀死的！ 告诉他该怎么做！
He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!

1002
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:15,660
那家伙距离我们有两个头，一英尺的距离，没有盲点
That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1003
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:17,628
他一定有弱点。找到它！
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1004
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,833
等等，等等，等等
Wait, wait, wait.

1005
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,474
右肩，右肩。 右肩！一定有问题！
Right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1006
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:31,010
每次他右手扔炸弹的时候，他的肩膀有点不灵活！
He's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb!

1007
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:33,473
抓到他弱点了！ 你看？又来了一次！
We got him! See? Here it comes again!

1008
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,345
低头躲闪！转身！ 向左侧移！全力挥臂！一，二！
Duck! Spin! Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

1009
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,648

Backstep. Backstep. Backstep. Lean right.

1010
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,779
快，Charlie！就是那儿！
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1011
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:44,483
必须靠近他不能够不到我们的地方！
Got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!

1012
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,755
身体左侧！身体右侧！ 身体左侧！
Left to the body! Right to the body! Left to the body!

1013
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,352
好耶！有效！
Yeah, it's working!

1014
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,364
呆在台阶下！左！右！左！
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

1015
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,667
这些编程模式不好用 左边！右勾拳，闪开！
- These program modes aren't working. - Left! Right hook, slip!

1016
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:59,433
右上勾拳！左上勾拳！ 向左蹲下！向右反击！
Right uppercut! Left uppercut! Duck left. Counter right!

1017
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,100
打倒他，Atom! 下面让你尝尝查理的特殊技能
- Get him, Atom! - Here comes the Charlie Special.

1018
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,379
三连击！ 出去！回来！反击！
Three-punch combo to the body! Out! In! Counter!

1019
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,380
二-一-二！ 二-一-二！
- Two-one-two! - Two-one-two.

1020
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,915
跟住他！向右刺！
Stay on him! Lunging right!

1021
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,516
别让他躲开，直击身体！ 直击头部！
Don't let him go. Right to the body! Straight right to the head!

1022
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,961
我们的系统崩溃了！
We got a systems crash!

1023
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,586
干掉他，Atom!
Get him, Atom!

1024
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,064
这不可能，天啊
This is not happening, man.

1025
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,563
把他甩开，Charlie！ 向左转！
- Put him away, Charlie! - Spin left!

1026
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:31,833
向右转！

干掉他！
Finish him!

1028
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,401
快点！ 右手上勾拳！
- Do it! - Right uppercut!

1029
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:48,714
他倒下了！
He's down!

1030
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,990
一！二！三！
One! Two! Three!

感谢大家今晚的光临！
I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight!

1042
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:40,470
我们来自垃圾厂的小机器人得到了一次联盟对决的机会
Our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.

1043
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,872
那怎么样？
How about that?

1044
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:47,741
我只想对一个不愿提及姓名的特殊女孩说，
And the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,

1045
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,749
Farra Lemkova. Farra Lemkova.

1046
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:57,821
而不是买我的机器人，用你的钱来控制这项运动...
That instead of buying my robot, using your money to control this sport...

1047
01:24:57,925 --> 01:24:59,756
这就对了！ 我还没完
- That's it! - I'm not done.

1048
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,489
为什么不给那个小家伙重重一击？
Why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?

1049
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:06,899
因为我保证如果你给他一击，他会让你大吃一惊！
Because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!

1050
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,593
难道你不想看看一个小家伙
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1051
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,728
在钢拳冠军赛中得到一次对决机会么？
get a shot at the Real Steel Championship?

1052
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:18,178
我将挑Zeus.
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1053
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:24,207
时间，地点，随便挑！
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1054
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:27,511
你说了算！我们一定到！
You name it! We will be there!

1055
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:37,131
我去安排一下这场比赛！
I'm going to get us that fight!

1056
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:44,061
Atom, Atom, Atom... Atom, Atom, Atom...

1057
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,215
你可真有种，敢那样挑战宙斯.
That was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.

1058
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,885
就是应该那样的
That's one thing to call it.

1059
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:02,250
很多人都希望看到那一幕
A lot of people would like to see that.

1060
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:05,253
你他妈说的很对，他们会的 你听到那个孩子说的么？我的天！
- You're damn right they would. - You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1061
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,255
打的好，伙计们 谢谢
- Good fight, fellas. - Thanks, man.

1062
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,223
看看这个，我们来庆祝吧 好啊
- Look at this. Let's celebrate. - Yeah.

1063
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,658
好了，三七开，对吧？ 对， 七成给我，三成给你
- All right, 70-30, right? - Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1064
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,257
太对了 太有趣了
- That's so right. - That's very funny.

1065
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:18,630
我告诉你我们不应该卖掉他 好吧，不，不，不
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him. - OK. No, no, no.

1066
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:22,903
我现在记住了，谁是对的？ 说谁是对的？说"Max是对的"
I remember now. Who's right? Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1067
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,978
好吧，好吧，好吧
All right, all right. All right.

1068
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:28,674
我们是一个好团队 不，不，Max是对的
- We're a good team. - No, no. Max is right.

1069
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:31,214
不敢相信 谢谢，双子城
That was unbelievable. Thank you, Twin Cities.

1070
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,121
我们定了？ 是啊
- We set? - Yeah.

1071
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,589
开始吧 查理男孩
- Let's do it. - Charlie boy.

1072
01:26:38,559 --> 01:26:41,858
Ricky，我正要给你打电话 哦，好的
- Ricky, I was just going to call you. - Oh, yeah.

1073
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:44,830
我真的正要给你打电话
I actually really was going to call you.

1074
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,763
别担心那个了
Don't worry about that.

1075
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,893
打的真他妈的漂亮
That was a heck of a fight.

1076
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:51,267
恭喜你们两位 真不错
Congratulations to both of you. That was good.

1077
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:54,268
打的很精彩 干的不错，年轻人
It was an amazing fight. That was a great job, young man.

1078
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:56,733
来吧，伙计 什么？
- Come on, man. - What?

1079
01:26:56,844 --> 01:27:00,974
你当真的？ 你觉得我是在开玩笑
- You serious? - You thought I was joking

1080
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:02,879
当我说我差一点就打败你的时候？
when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?

1081
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:06,078
他觉得这是个玩笑 这不是玩笑
He thought that was a joke. It wasn't a joke.

1082
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:10,351
我这儿有个孩子，我有你的钱 我们没有问题了吧
I got a kid here. And I have your money. We don't have a problem.

1083
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,183
我确定你有
I'm sure you do,

1084
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:16,320
但是我们知道这不仅仅是钱的问题吧，不是么？
but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?

1085
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:21,796
好吧，你们想要什么？ 你们想要两万五，三万？你想要三万？
All right. What do you want? You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1086
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,666
我这儿有现金 是，好的
- I got the money in cash here. - Yeah, right.

1087
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,899
快走！ Max，走！走啊！快跑！
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1088
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:30,307
快跑！快，跟上，跟上！ 抓住他！
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up! - Get him now!

1089
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:31,873
跑啊！快点！
Run! Come on!

1090
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,375
放开他！放开他！
Get off him! Get off him!

1091
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:39,843
过来！
Come here!

1092
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,250
嘿， Ricky.
Hey, Ricky.

1093
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:47,020
那是他的钱！ 别把他也牵扯进来！
That's his money! Leave him out of this!

1094
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,331
住手！
Stop!

1095
01:28:03,844 --> 01:28:05,106
住手！
Stop!

1096
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:08,841
把钱都拿走，全都拿走吧
Take all his money. Take it all.

1097
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,912
你朋友真是个大傻逼，孩子
Your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.

1098
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:15,682
他是我爸爸！
He's my father!

1099
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:22,660
好吧，看起来不只是差一点点吧
Well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.

1100
01:28:22,763 --> 01:28:25,425
好吧，伙计，那会教训他的
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1101
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:34,007
正像是以前的时光，查理男孩！
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1102
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,370
我们走，孩子们
Let's go, boys.

1103
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:05,432
很抱歉，Max.我很抱歉，抱歉
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1104
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,911
我们在这里干什么呢？ Max，只是...
- What are we doing here? - Max, just...

1105
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,109
那是Farra么？她给你打电话了，不是么？ 我们要去参加Zeus挑战赛
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she? We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1106
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:55,382
它不是Zeus的人，我从来没想过会这样，而且...
It's not the Zeus people. I've been thinking about all this, and...

1107
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:58,517
Max! Max!

1108
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:10,066
见到你很高兴
It's so good to see you.

1109
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,765
她在做什么？ 现在最好是你和她走
- What is she doing here? - It's better if you go with her now.

1110
01:30:12,873 --> 01:30:14,932
我们惨败，所以你叫她来接我？
We get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?

1111
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:16,942
他被打败了.我告诉过你他不能照顾好自己的！
He's been beat up. I told you he couldn't take care of him!

1112
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:19,842
是啊，我叫了她 看看我们，我们一团糟.
Yeah. I called her. Look at us. We're a mess.

1113
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,972
我们没事，她可以走了！
We're fine. She can leave!

1114
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:25,109
Atom打的很不错 我们会把钱赚回来的
Atom's fighting good. We can make the money back.

1115
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,820
Charlie，求你了
Charlie, please.

1116
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:29,948
只是...
Just...

1117
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:35,328
Charlie，我们做的很好
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1118
01:30:37,264 --> 01:30:39,232
Charlie，求你了，别这样
Charlie, please, no.

1119
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,163
不要，不要，不要这样
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1120
01:30:44,171 --> 01:30:47,106
求，求你了
Please. Please.

1121
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,873
相信我，孩子 这样最好，好么？
Trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?

1122
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,383
我知道你可能觉得你知道什么是对的，但是你并不知道
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.

1123
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,147
你还太年轻，你不会懂的
You're too young. You don't know.

1124
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,915
看着我，相信我
Look at me, trust me.

1125
01:31:02,022 --> 01:31:05,253
而且法律上，她有监护权 所以我还能做什么？
And legally she has custody, so what can I do?

1126
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,058
我能做什么？
What can I do?

1127
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:25,005
我不需要你的钱，Marvin
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1128
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:28,206
Max，我们有自己的游泳池
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1129
01:31:28,315 --> 01:31:33,014
我们有一个大热水缸，还有很多可以玩的超有趣的玩具
and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.

1130
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,884
你不想和他们一起玩么？ 很有趣的
Do you want to play with them? It's going to be fun.

1131
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,080
这发生了什么？
What's going on?

1132
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:40,956
他不想和我说话 所以多亏了你，Charlie.
He won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.

1133
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,429
我去车上等
I'm going to wait in the car.

1134
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,601
你不想谈谈，没关系，我来说
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1135
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:50,871
你想让我说什么？说我很抱歉？
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1136
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:54,031
你知道从第一天起就是这样
You knew from day one what this was.

1137
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:56,006
是你决定开始这段旅程的
You decided to take the ride.

1138
01:31:56,510 --> 01:32:00,378
你认为我，你，和从垃圾场捡到的小机器人
You thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap

1139
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,039
能够飞黄腾达？
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1140
01:32:05,085 --> 01:32:07,485
不，你忘记了我是谁！
No, you forgot who I was!

1141
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,051
你应该得到更好的...
You deserve better...

1142
01:32:16,463 --> 01:32:17,555
...比我更好的
...than me.

1143
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,933
求你说点什么吧？
Will you say something, please?

1144
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,472
我试过了，你想从我这里得到什么？
I tried. What do you want from me?

1145
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:28,337
我想求你为我而战
I want you to fight for me.

1146
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:31,408
我想要的就只有这样
That's all I ever wanted.

1147
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,060
别问了
Don't ask.

1148
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,607
就是说不行，Max
So no Max.

1149
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,605
最好这样 Marv和Debra有钱，Max准备好了
It's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1150
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,545
你没有注意到他看你的方式？
Did you not see the way he looked at you?

1151
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:52,049
就是我看我父亲的那种方式
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1152
01:34:52,152 --> 01:34:54,347
即使到现在我愿意放弃一切挽回曾经的那些
Even now I would give anything to have that back.

1153
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:58,516
你爸爸很特别 他从第一天起就默默的在角落里守护你
Your dad was special. He was in your corner from day one.

1154
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:01,290
我，来吧，我搞砸了
Me, come on. I blew it.

1155
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,562
我搞砸了
I blew it.

1156
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,400
当Max出生时，我...
When Max was born I just...

1157
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:09,501
...吓坏了
...freaked out.

1158
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,798
但是有些事情总比什么都没有的要好
But something would have been better than nothing.

1159
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:13,368
我不知道从哪里开始
I wouldn't know where to start.

1160
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:14,498
是的，你知道 我不知道
- Yeah, you do. - I don't.

1161
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,235
你知道 不
- You do. - No.

1162
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,303
你知道
You do.

1163
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,337
我要走了
I got to go.

1164
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:56,849
两百英里就为了一吻
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1165
01:35:58,452 --> 01:36:00,852
值得的，值得的
Worth it. Worth it.

1166
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:13,789
去追上他，Charlie.
Go get him, Charlie.

1167
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,636
你说话的方式像我爸爸
You sound like your dad.

1168
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:50,701
听着，我知道你认为我已经放弃了你，
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1169
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:53,671
我猜我原本也是这么打算的
and I guess I did originally.

1170
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:54,798
然后你出卖了我
Then you sold me.

1171
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:56,635
Charlie. Charlie.

1172
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,679
在这儿你已经没有什么事了
You have no business being here.

1173
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,340
那是真的 你已经得到了全部抚养权，他是你的了
That's true. You've got full custody. He's yours.

1174
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:06,385
我知道我对这个孩子做了太多的错事，但是请允许我...
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1175
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:10,480
...做一件正确的事情
...I'd just like to do one thing right.

1176
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,518
好吧
Right.

1177
01:37:16,196 --> 01:37:17,823
我们在哪儿？ 你出卖了我
- Where were we? - You sold me.

1178
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:20,229
是的，对，就是发生了
Right, yeah, that happened.

1179
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,529
等等，什么？ 我们已经破产了
- Wait, what? - Then we had our asses kicked.

1180
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,797
你就睡在卡车架子上，太糟糕了
And you slept on a shelf in a truck, and it was awful.

1181
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:26,634
而且危险 相当危险
- And dangerous. - Really dangerous.

1182
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,608
我是说，我知道，天啊，我很抱歉
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1183
01:37:31,678 --> 01:37:34,670
你来就是为了这个？ 来说对不起？
That's why you came? To say you're sorry?

1184
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:37,272
不，我是说，是的，是的
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1185
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:43,848
但是不，不，我来告诉你我听到的关于你的事
But no. No, I came to tell you that I heard you.

1186
01:37:44,825 --> 01:37:48,317
我懂了 我有点迟钝，但是我懂了
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1187
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:53,358
我知道你已经流浪了，但是我没有陪你，我原本可以的
I know you had a bum ride, and I wasn't there and I should have been.

1188
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:55,659
我原本可以的
I should have been.

1189
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:58,394
你妈妈...
Your mom was...

1190
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,771
你妈妈很酷，不是么？
She was cool, wasn't she?

1191
01:38:02,342 --> 01:38:03,400
她是的
She was.

1192
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:05,575
她是最酷的
She was the coolest.

1193
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:08,938
是的，没错
Yeah, she was.

1194
01:38:11,818 --> 01:38:16,812
对于发生在她身上的事我很抱歉
And I'm sorry about... what happened with her.

1195
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:22,855
而且我不能挽回那些日子了， Max,
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1196
01:38:22,963 --> 01:38:26,262
但是现在我在这里...
but I'm here right now...

1197
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:30,899
...如果你准备好的话，我要准备战斗了
...and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.

1198
01:38:44,851 --> 01:38:46,580
我们要挑战Zeus
We got the Zeus fight.

1199
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:47,847
什么？
What?

1200
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:49,855
不，不，我们不能
No, no, we didn't.

1201
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:52,782
你得到了Zeus挑战赛
You got the Zeus fight.

1202
01:38:56,697 --> 01:38:58,631
你觉得怎么样，Debra?
So what do you say, Debra?

1203
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:00,290
我们能做最后一件事情么？
Can we do this one last thing?

1204
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:06,298
就一晚上 我们只需要一晚上，谢谢
- One night. - It's all we need. Thank you.

1205
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:14,974
我们可能会惨败，但是至少我们虽败犹荣
We'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.

1206
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:17,976
是么？你觉得怎么样？
Yeah? What do you say?

1207
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:24,621
欢迎来到纽约必应竞技场观看真正的钢拳冠军争霸赛！
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1208
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:27,023
Tim，就是这样比赛 我们从来没想过会看到
Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.

1209
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:29,522
Zeus，独孤求败的WRB冠军
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

1210
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:32,895
对阵败犬，明日之星Atom.
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1211
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,900
冠军经理人已经同意将这场比赛
The champ's handlers have agreed to fight

1212
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,664
放到知名联盟机器人争霸赛的场外
outside the circle of well-known League bots,

1213
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:41,901
决定给观众一个近距离的直观全景！
and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1214
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:45,536
Tim，帮我理理清楚 冠军者Zeus是不是脑子不正常了？
Now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1215
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,409
最有名，伟大的机器人拳击手
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1216
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:50,506
要和一个G-2级别，叫Atom的同场竞技？
gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?

1217
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:54,553
好吧，Herb，如果你去问Tak Mashido，Zeus的团队所有人都疯了
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1218
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,919
别看他入场时候，酷劲十足
Now, he may look cool as he enters the arena,

1219
01:39:57,024 --> 01:40:00,050
但是他弱不禁风的样子对这样的比赛简直就是轻视
but he has made no bones about his disdain for this matchup.

1220
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,988
本周早些时候我们的摄像师想要拍摄他
Our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.

1221
01:40:03,096 --> 01:40:06,088
看看这些片段，Mashido都忍不住要停下来对媒体说
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

1222
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,563
这场比赛对他的机器人来说简直就是一种羞辱
referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.

1223
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:13,538
现在，Max Kenton，Atom的训练师做的不仅仅是挑战Zeus
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.

1224
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,868
他是当着媒体的面做出的挑战
He did so publicly.

1225
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:18,672
他的挑战成为了冠军的毒瘤和噩梦
The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1226
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,442
此处不语评论，我觉得Zeus的团队很清楚他们在做什么
No argument there. And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1227
01:40:22,549 --> 01:40:23,982
但是他们就是这么做了
That they do. Come on.

1228
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:27,110
接受一个无名小卒的挑战
Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.

1229
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:30,515
这个“垃圾场选手”如果你愿意这么叫 这就是个市场噱头
This "junkyard dog," if you will. That's a marketing stunt.

1230
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:33,422
从涌动的人潮可以看出来，这个噱头很有效
And judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.

1231
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,039
我们赢不了，不是么
We can't win, can we?

1232
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:51,169
走着瞧吧
We'll see.

1233
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:57,744
当挑战者进入竞技场时
As the challenger makes his way into the arena,

1234
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:00,046
你们能听到如海潮般的尖叫声
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1235
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,864
Atom也来到了WRB的场地，带着强烈的
Atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1236
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:17,766
称之为人性的态度，
using a style, some would call it human-like,

1237
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:20,465
这在机器人争霸赛中从没有过
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1238
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,769
Atom和他的小号训练者走进了场地
Atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring

1239
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:25,743
看Farra Lemkova的脸上表情说明了一切
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1240
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:28,007
欢迎来到大人的世界，小孩子们！
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1241
01:41:28,115 --> 01:41:30,948
我以1赔5的比例压Atom挺不过第一轮
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.

1242
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:32,541
谁想来下注
Who wants some?

1243
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:34,881
我来押注
I'll take some of that action.

1244
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:38,151
我来押注
Hey, there! I'll take some of that action.

1245
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:42,553
怎么样了伙计？
How's it going... partner?

1246
01:41:42,662 --> 01:41:44,027
伙计？
Partner?

1247
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:47,761
太好了。十万怎么样？ 有意思么？
That's great. How about a hundred K? Is that funny?

1248
01:41:47,868 --> 01:41:50,530
十万赌Atom见不到第二轮
Hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.

1249
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:52,468
你就这样到处宣传？
You carrying around that kind of scratch?

1250
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,970
是啊 十万？
- Yeah. - Hundred K?

1251
01:41:56,676 --> 01:42:00,908
你给我记住 101节，C排
Tell you what. Remember section 101, row C,

1252
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:03,710
你去把我的钱带到我的座位这里来
and you can bring me my money right to my seat.

1253
01:42:03,817 --> 01:42:07,184
101，C排？十万？
101, row C? Hundred K?

1254
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,216
你说的没错，homey
You heard me, homey.

1255
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,184
对吧？
- Homey? - Right? homey？

1256
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:12,651
伙计！
Homeboy!

1257
01:42:13,827 --> 01:42:16,159
好吧，再见，posse
All right. Peace out, posse.

1258
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:17,760
快，亲爱的，我们走
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1259
01:42:41,555 --> 01:42:44,183
永远不会被击倒 比赛开始！
- Never beaten. - It's showtime!

1260
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,584
从不被威胁
Never threatened.

1261
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:49,856
拳击场之王
The king of the ring,

1262
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:52,090
机器人的统治者！
the ruler of robots!

1263
01:42:53,266 --> 01:42:58,602
向伟大的Zeus致敬！
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1264
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:25,255
哦，我靠！
Oh, shit!

1265
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:33,135
太棒了
That was awesome.

1266
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:40,973
快，我们走
Come on, let's go.

1267

女士们，先生们

1271
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:02,694

1272
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,040
在我左手边的是

1276
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:28,989
女士们，先生们 你们准备好
And now, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready

1277
01:44:29,095 --> 01:44:34,089
观看真正的钢拳比赛了么？！
for Real Steel!

1278
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,197
这就是你们想要看到的！
This is what it's all about!

1279
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:42,298
开始铃声响了 比赛正式开始

1283
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:52,317
看起来今天我们可能需要另外一个Zeus急救了

1284
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:57,188

1287

- He's too strong! - That's my boy right there!

1291
01:45:18,745 --> 01:45:20,269
站起来投入比赛！
Get up and get in the game!

1292
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,406
快，不要啊，求你快起来！Atom 求你了

1293
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:26,242
起来！起来！起来！

1294
01:45:27,887 --> 01:45:31,288
又一次 挑战者站了起来！

1297
01:45:35,428 --> 01:45:37,794
快离开那儿！ 移动！

1298
01:45:40,066 --> 01:45:42,125
一次毁灭性的内侧拳

1299
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:43,361
把手举起来！

1300

起来，Atom 起来，Atom

1313
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:23,308
八！九！
Eight! Nine!

1314
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:28,872
我简直不能相信！无论多困难，这个小机器人又一次的站起来了
I don't believe this! Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.

1315
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,142
加油Atom ！
Come on, Atom!

1316
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:35,447
他过不了这关的！
He can't survive this!

1317
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,454
加油Charlie! 右手上勾拳！
- Come on, Charlie! - Right uppercut!

1318
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:45,490
Atom打出了一记重击！
Atom has landed a punch!

1319
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:50,827
Zeus被突如其来的打得他原地转了一圈的上勾拳吓到了！
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1320
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,370

Advance!

1321

后退，右手反击！
Fade back, counter right!

1322
01:46:54,774 --> 01:46:55,934
后退，右手反击！
Fade back, counter right!

1323
01:46:56,776 --> 01:47:01,213
右边双手交叉！右边双手交叉！ 右边双手交叉！左边勾拳！
Right cross! Right cross! Right cross! Left hook!

1324
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:04,181
继续！加油！ 打倒他！
- Let's go! Come on! - Take him down!

1325
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:06,910
在Zeus统治的拳击场里，从来没有遇到过
For the first time in his dominant run,

1326
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,888
这样一位不轻言放弃的机器人选手！
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!

1327
01:47:12,525 --> 01:47:15,358
观众近乎疯狂！ Zeus使出了浑身招数
The crowd is going nuts! Zeus gives it everything he's got

1328
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:18,431
但是距离第一节比赛只剩下15秒的时间了！
as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!

1329
01:47:18,531 --> 01:47:22,490
Zeus将Atom逼到角里，用双拳重击两次！
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!

1330
01:47:22,802 --> 01:47:25,794
各位观众朋友，此时此刻，钟声响起了！
Downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!

1331
01:47:25,905 --> 01:47:28,965
举起手来，下巴掉下来 保持低位，保持低位！
- Hands up, chin down. - Stay low, stay low!

1332
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:37,542
只剩下5秒时间，冠军使出了必杀技！
Only five seconds left, as here comes that piston-packed right of the champ!

1333
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:43,249
钟声想起来了，不敢相信 不管怎样Atom坚持下来了！
There's the bell! I don't believe it. Somehow Atom has survived.

1334
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:48,419
我们还有第二轮，观众们都异常兴奋！
We will have a second round. And the crowd here is thrilled!

1335
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:54,864
他做到了！哦也！Corner!
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1336
01:47:56,336 --> 01:48:00,170
我们要离开这儿 我们要立刻离开这儿！
We got to get out of here. We got to get out of here now!

1337
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:05,274
我们要这样做，快！
We got to go this way. Come on!

1338
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:12,147
好吧，你坐下
OK, you sit down.

1339
01:48:15,321 --> 01:48:18,017
出发吧，伙计 好吧
- Let's go, homey. - All right.

1340
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:19,557
我会回来找你的，亲爱的
I'll be back for you, baby.

1341
01:48:20,527 --> 01:48:22,859
把你的手放开！
Get your hands off me!

1342
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:28,200
两边的团队成员都在迅速的修整机器人
Both corners furiously working on their bots.

1343
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:31,634
今晚来到这儿的观众都期待一张屠杀
This crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre,

1344
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:33,929
但是他们看到的却是一场战斗！
but instead they're getting a war!

1345
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,371
你懂了？ 是的
- You got it? - Yeah.

1346
01:48:35,475 --> 01:48:36,499
好吧，出发吧
All right. Here we go.

1347
01:48:36,609 --> 01:48:38,907
发生了什么？
What is happening?

1348
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:44,006
他已经完全考虑到了所有意外的可能，他会没事的
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.

1349
01:48:44,117 --> 01:48:45,414
接下来怎么样？
What next?

1350
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:47,583
第二轮
Round two.

1351
01:48:55,895 --> 01:48:59,194
第二轮开始， 难以置信的挑战者，Atom,
Round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1352
01:48:59,299 --> 01:49:01,324
正逼得这位冠军为了他的钱而战
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1353
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:06,664
Zeus将小个子机器人像垃圾桶一样甩过了场地！
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!

1354
01:49:10,443 --> 01:49:15,437
Kenton操作的机器人三连击直接击中了冠军的头部！
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1355
01:49:20,486 --> 01:49:24,479
面对面对峙，发出了刺耳的撞击声！
Toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!

1356
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:31,326
不管corner使用的是什么战术，都没有起到作用！
Whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!

1357
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:37,500
针尖对麦芒，招招到肉的战斗
Metal bashing metal. Steel smashing steel.

1358
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:40,004
这才是一场大战！
This is a brawl!

1359
01:49:42,609 --> 01:49:47,512
观众们欢呼雀跃，看着两台机器猛兽互相性命！
The crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!

1360
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:50,310
一定要有些付出，的确如此！
Something has to give, and it does!

1361
01:49:50,416 --> 01:49:52,247
Atom又一次倒下了！
Atom goes down again!

1362
01:49:52,352 --> 01:49:56,482
看来今晚表现抢眼的垃圾场败犬的表演要结束了！
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!

1363
01:49:58,591 --> 01:50:01,253
但是还没有结束， Atom站起来了
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1364
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:05,957
Kenton一定是将自己的战斗不息的坚强意志传输给了这台机器人！
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!

1365
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:17,300
第四轮已经过半，Zeus希望立刻结束这场比赛
Midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.

1366
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:21,744
冠军孤注一掷，用力敲破锁扣装置！
The champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1367
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:35,722
Atom 在场地中跌跌撞撞，很明显迷失了方向感！
Atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!

1368
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,428
举起手来！ 发生了什么？
- Hands up! - What's going on?

1369
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:40,465
我觉得声音识别系统坏了！ 他没有反应！
I think the voice recog is shot! He's not responding!

1370
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:48,470
Zeus找到了另外一个暴力装置，直捣Atom的腹部
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1371
01:50:48,574 --> 01:50:51,771
不！停下！做点什么！
No! Stop! Do something!

1372
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:53,102
他听不到我！
He can't hear me!

1373
01:50:54,447 --> 01:51:00,079
但是铃声在响，又一次这个小机器人让全世界震惊了！
But the bell sounds, and once again this little robot has stunned the world!

1374
01:51:02,188 --> 01:51:06,591
我们完蛋了Max!他听不到我 这就是谋杀，我们已经够了
We're done, Max! He can't hear me. This is murder. We've had enough.

1375
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:09,253
我破坏了声音识别系统 他听不到我！
- I'm disabling the voice recognition. - He can't hear me!

1376
01:51:09,362 --> 01:51:11,694
是的，但是他能看到你！ 什么？
- Yes, but he can see you! - What?

1377
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:16,067
我把他设置成影子模式 告诉他该怎么做
I'm putting him in shadow mode. Show him what to do.

1378
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:18,535
不用声音识别，他会移动的更快
Without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!

1379
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:19,798
不可能，不可能！
No way. No way!

1380
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:22,074
看看他们，他们吓坏了！
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1381
01:51:22,575 --> 01:51:24,634
有钱的小女孩正在那边帮他找一个新的!
Rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!

1382
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:26,769
你知道为什么么？ 因为他们害怕了
Do you know why? Because they're scared.

1383
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,241
因为Atom能做到其他机器人不能做的事情
Because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.

1384
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,214
但是我做不到 是的，你能
- But I can't do it! - Yes, you can.

1385
01:51:31,317 --> 01:51:34,115
我不能 是的，你能
- I can't. - Yes, you can.

1386
01:51:35,254 --> 01:51:38,712
告诉他还怎么做 你不用在最后一轮出击
Show him what to do. You have to fight the last round.

1387
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:40,390
别问我，别这样
Don't ask me. Don't.

1388
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:45,089
Charlie...求你了
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1389
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,230
你用这些眼睛骗我呢啊？
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1390
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,577
我靠！
Damn it!

1391
01:51:58,678 --> 01:51:59,736
是的！
Yes!

1392
01:52:00,546 --> 01:52:02,138
不能相信我要这么做
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1393
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:05,582
我知道你在那儿！我不确定你能不能懂我的意思
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what,

1394
01:52:05,685 --> 01:52:07,118
但是我知道你在那儿！
but I know you're in there!

1395
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,484
Kenton.上还是不上？ 上，给我一分钟
- Kenton. In or out? - In. Give me a minute.

1396
01:52:13,092 --> 01:52:17,654
我知道你听不到我 但是你能看到我，看着我！
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!

1397
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:20,426
看着...我
Watch... me.

1398
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:24,196
你知道你在和一个机器人说话 我知道，闭嘴
- You know you're talking to a robot. - I know. Shut up.

1399
01:52:25,304 --> 01:52:26,862
看着我
Watch me.

1400
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,331
今天晚上是一场世纪大战
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1401
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:31,535
五轮半都已经过去了
as the fifth and final round gets underway.

1402
01:52:31,644 --> 01:52:33,271
加油，Atom!
Come on, Atom!

1403
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:45,189
等一下，你们看到了没？
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1404
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:48,419
Charlie Kenton在场地外在做空击练习
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

1405
01:52:48,528 --> 01:52:50,723
看起来Atom有影子功能
It looks like Atom has a shadow function.

1406
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:53,697
也就是说Charlie Kenton
So, basically, that means Charlie Kenton

1407
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,667
在最后一轮用这种方式对抗Zeus.
is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.

1408
01:52:56,769 --> 01:53:01,365
看起来没什么帮助，因为Atom又一次靠在了防护绳上
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.

1409
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:05,309
帮他！反击！
Help him! Fight back!

1410
01:53:05,411 --> 01:53:06,503
还不行
Not yet.

1411
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:13,847
正当Zeus用重锤砸下来时，Tak Mashido亲自指挥

1412
01:53:14,153 --> 01:53:16,883
希望一次性解决战斗

1413
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:20,916
我要告诉你们，朋友们，冠军看起来累了
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.

1414
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:23,457
这个机器人看起来有点发虚
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1415
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,632
我不敢相信 Atom在嘲弄Zeus
I don't believe it. Atom is taunting Zeus.

1416
01:53:29,735 --> 01:53:33,364
转到加速！ 他希望得到更多！
- Switch to turbo! - He's actually asking for more.

1417
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:36,865
求你做点事！
Please do something!

1418
01:53:37,176 --> 01:53:39,406
还不行 对的，Charlie，还不到时候
- Not yet. - That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1419
01:53:42,181 --> 01:53:43,546
氮气活塞，现在！
Nitrous pistons, now!

1420
01:53:46,686 --> 01:53:48,654
他坚持不了多久！
He's not going to last much longer!

1421
01:53:48,754 --> 01:53:50,688
反击！ 还不行
- Fight back! - Not yet.

1422
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:52,719
等等！
Hang in there!

1423
01:53:52,825 --> 01:53:58,286
Atom被 Zeus的氮气燃料机枪打的全身是洞！
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1424
01:53:59,465 --> 01:54:03,299
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1425
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:08,733
等他出来，等他出来！还不行！

Zeus在减速！

1427
01:54:13,546 --> 01:54:16,413
冠军的燃料内核很明显耗尽了

1428
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:17,574
Charlie，求你了！
Charlie, please!

1429
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:20,911
嘿，孩子
Hey, kid.

1430
01:54:21,787 --> 01:54:23,379
现在 现在!

1431
01:54:28,661 --> 01:54:29,719
瞄准他！
Get in there!

1432
01:54:32,298 --> 01:54:34,562
打掉那个混蛋！把他炸开！
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1433
01:54:43,509 --> 01:54:44,874
对！就这样！

1434
01:54:46,445 --> 01:54:47,673
做点什么！
Do something!

1435
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:49,606

重置，恢复手动操作

一个令人震惊的动作，Tak Mashido亲自手动操作他的机器人！
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!

1438
01:55:10,803 --> 01:55:13,499
操纵身体！靠近他！ 打倒他，Atom!
- Work the body! Get inside him! - Get him, Atom!

1439
01:55:15,274 --> 01:55:19,768
看看这个！冠军正在竭尽全力的想要站起来
Look at this! The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet,

1440
01:55:19,879 --> 01:55:25,044
但是Kenton没有停下来，一拳接一拳重重的打在他的身上！
but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!

1441
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,621
左！右！左！右！
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1442
01:56:09,729 --> 01:56:14,894
Atom使出了一击上勾拳！Zeus倒下了！
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1443
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:22,768
这个小机器人今晚发挥了全部潜力
This little bot has dug deep here tonight

1444
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,605
展现了近乎令人窒息的一面！
and shown something damn near heart!

1445
01:56:25,711 --> 01:56:29,909
一，二，三，
One, two, three,

1446
01:56:30,016 --> 01:56:34,953
四，五，六，七...
four, five, six, seven...

1447
01:56:35,054 --> 01:56:36,078
好样的！
He's good!

1448
01:56:36,389 --> 01:56:39,722
Zeus站起来了，但是Kenton操纵Atom又一次压在他身上
Zeus gets to his feet, but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1449
01:56:39,825 --> 01:56:41,588
一拳接一拳的不停痛击！
landing punch after punch!

1450
01:56:41,694 --> 01:56:44,060
Tak Mashido和他的超级机器人没有了反应
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.

1451
01:56:44,363 --> 01:56:47,457
Zeus卡住Atom的左臂，但是Kenton却不畏惧！
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!

1452
01:56:47,566 --> 01:56:50,535
一切就到此为止，伙计们！
It all comes down to this, folks!

1453
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:52,536
摔他，Charlie！现在！
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1454
01:56:52,638 --> 01:56:55,630
Kenton正要把冠军重摔在地... 不！此刻铃声响了！
- Kenton is about to drop the champ... - No! There's the bell!

1455
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,871
Zeus被铃声救了一命！
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1456
01:57:05,785 --> 01:57:08,686
太神奇了，我们来看裁判们的板子！
Amazingly, we will go to the judges' cards!

1457
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:26,134
女士们先生们，五轮过后
Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds,

1458
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:28,999
我们来看一下裁判们的分数牌
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1459
01:57:32,945 --> 01:57:37,507
一号裁判 得分47-48
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

1460
01:57:37,616 --> 01:57:42,576

And Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46,

1462
01:57:47,526 --> 01:57:52,725
所以获胜者依然是世界机器人拳击争霸赛总冠军，
for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1463
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:55,130
Zeus! Zeus!

1464
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:04,736
Farra Lemkova, Farra Lemkova,

1465
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:07,142
今晚你得到的比预期的要多好多
you got way more than you bargained for tonight.

1466
01:58:07,446 --> 01:58:10,813
有些人会说你的机器人赢了口碑却输了比赛
Some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.

1467
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:12,846
她看起来很生气
She looks pissed.

1468
01:58:13,552 --> 01:58:15,782
比我们想想的花的时间要长
It took a little longer than we thought,

1469
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:19,085
但是结果不出所料
but the result is as expected.

1470
01:58:20,526 --> 01:58:24,895
我们赢了，Zeus依然无人可敌
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1471
01:58:30,169 --> 01:58:33,502
你的机器人今天晚上受尽侮辱
Any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss

1472
01:58:33,606 --> 01:58:34,868
还差点失败，你就没什么好评论的？
your bot suffered tonight?

1473
01:58:37,877 --> 01:58:40,505
没有 毫无评论
- Nothing. - No comment.

1474
01:58:40,613 --> 01:58:41,944
Max,Max 在哪儿？
Max. Where's Max?

1475
01:58:45,618 --> 01:58:46,778
他在这儿Max
There he is. Max.

1476
01:58:48,554 --> 01:58:51,955
他们已经开始叫你的机器人“人民冠军”了
They're already calling your bot "the people's champion."

1477
01:58:55,494 --> 01:58:57,257
关于此你有什么看法？
What do you say to that?

1478
01:58:58,230 --> 01:58:59,720
人民冠军？
People's champion?

1479
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:03,692
听起来还不赖
Sounds pretty good to me.

1480
01:59:09,608 --> 01:59:11,667
爸爸？爸爸！
Dad? Dad!

1481
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:16,808
爸爸！
Dad!

1482
01:59:27,726 --> 01:59:29,250
我真的想让你知道...
I really want you to know...

1483
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:31,621
不，你必须知道
No, I need you to know.

1484
01:59:33,732 --> 01:59:34,960
别担心
Don't worry.

1485
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:37,731
你的秘密我会保守的
Your secret's safe with me.

1486
01:59:44,777 --> 01:59:46,540
在这儿等着，在这儿等着
Wait here. Wait here.

1487
02:00:31,223 --> 02:00:32,918
好的！
Yes!

02:00:34,918 --> 02:00:52,918
