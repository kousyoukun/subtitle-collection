- You're into me for 30 grand. - Jack, I'm going to pay you.

7
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,852
我不是Jack 我是比爾
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.

00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,482
你還欠Jack錢？你最好先還我
You owe Jack money, too? You pay me first!

9
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:34,359

Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your money. It's right here in my hand.

10
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,364

Why don't we meet up on the?

11
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,906
- 喂？你的訊號很差 - 我聽不到你
- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello? - I'm losing you.

12
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,498
我聽不清楚你說什么...
I can't hear what you're say...

13
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,743
先生您好 那個是突擊者號嗎？
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

14
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,644
- 是的 - 我們可以看看嗎？

15
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,386
- 你們想看？- 耶
- You want to see him? - Yeah.

16
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,753

Give me a minute.

17
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,056

00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,529
...突擊者號！ 啟動 啟動！

19
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,822
- 他要跟誰比賽？- 其實他是要跟...
- What robot is he fighting? - Actually he's going to fight...

20
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,484
噢 小妹妹 你要干嘛？
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

21
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,891
我可不可以跟他照個像？
Can we get a picture with him?

22
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,657
當然可以 五塊錢
Sure. For five dollars.

23
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,857
照個像要五元？你開玩笑吧？
You want five dollars? Seriously?

24
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,594
沒開玩笑 馬上給我五元
No, I want five dollars immediately.

25
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,398
走吧！小朋友！

- 好啦！我開玩笑的 三元就好 - 你慢慢想吧
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks. - Whatever.

27
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,104
- 那就二塊半好了？- 你這個遜?！
- How about $2.50? - You suck!

28
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,747
又是一個鄉巴佬小鎮 是吧？
It's going to be one of those towns, huh?

29
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,588
各位先生女士們 歡迎來到2020年圣蘭卓鄉村市集
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

30
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,148
各位請坐 我們將要開始了
Please take your seats. We're almost ready to get this thing started.

31
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,897
講好的是我的機器人對抗800磅的牛
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.

32
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,728
那只牛絕對不止800磅 你這個呆頭
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

33
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:23,795
Charlie"無所不能小子" 肯頓 看來你也老了 老朋友
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time has not been good to you, my friend.

34
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,536
- 里奇 麻煩大了 - 不要激動 老朋友
- Ricky, we got a big problem here. - Slow down there, hoss.

35
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:33,138
最后一次我們的見面是在桑休士頓中心
Last time I saw you, you were staring at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

36
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,747
我正好賞你一記右叉拳
with the taste of my right cross all over your face.

37
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,685
- 準備好了嗎？- 耶
- Are we good to go here? - Yeah.

38
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,657
說好的是我的機器人對抗800磅的牛 代價是三千元
We agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,489
- 真的嘛？- 是的 說好的是這樣
- Am I right? - Yes, sir. We did.

40
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,620
但是那只牛看起來大概是2000磅
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

41
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,220
打個商量
I'll tell you something.

42
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:53,730
如果你的機器人不打 你一分錢都拿不到 怎么樣？
Your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! How about that?

43
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,163
滾吧你！
Get the hell out of here.

44
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,842
要不要賭大一點 我的機器人跟你的牛對打
Why don't we make this more interesting. My bot against your bull, straight up.

45
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,006
- 賭多少？- 二萬 勝方獨贏
- How much? - Twenty grand, winner takes all.

46
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,778
- 二萬？你有錢可以賭？- 藏在我車上
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand? - In a safe in my truck.

47
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:14,746
Charlie 好吧！
All right, Charlie.

48
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:18,987
二萬就二萬 但是如果你輸了繞跑
Twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,

49
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,586
我見你一次就海扁你一次
I'll come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.

50
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,858
你知道我沒騙你 因為我時常在扁你
You know that I can do that because I already done done it!

51
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,800
別靠我那么那么近 你這個拳擊場上的娘娘腔 到底比不比？
In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

52
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:33,007
那好 握手然后“?” 像以前一樣 你要不要再被我扁？
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that once again. You want to dance again?

53
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:36,567
幫這家伙加加油 給他點好運 他需要點運氣 耶！
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck. He needs some luck, y'all.

54
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,673
不要再惹那只牛！
Don't touch that bull.

55
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,876
各位先生女士們 我來問一下；
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

56
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,545
這里有沒有人是機器人拳擊賽的粉絲？
do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?

57
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,216
各位好朋友 注意聽著 我了解………
Now, listen, friends, I understand

58
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:54,121
不是每個人都可以付得起300元的門票
we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas

59
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,167
然后一路到達拉斯去看世界杯機器人拳擊大賽！
and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights.

60
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,567
所以我決定給你們帶來一場機器人拳擊比賽
So, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match

61
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,039
就在這里 我們的圣卓蘭鄉村市集上
right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.

62
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,575
喜歡嗎？
How about that?

63
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,772
各位先生女士們 我來介紹
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,

64
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,546
突擊者號！
Ambush!

65
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,950
來吧 開始吧！
Let's do it!

66
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:22,954
好樣的 大家伙
All right, big fella.

67
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,259
他是不是一個大家伙啊？
He's a big fella, ain't he?

68
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,002
轉一圈 讓大家看看你有多威猛！
Take a turn. Let them see how beautiful you are.

69
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:39,866
看看你有多有力！
Show them some power.

70
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,843
大家趕快看 他在為我們表演功夫喔
Look at that. He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

71
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,276
耶 大家伙！
Yeah, big fella.

72
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,642
突擊者號的對手是年度公牛大賽……
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up

73
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,811
擊倒率最高的………
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

74
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,754
各位先生女士們
ladies and gentlemen,

75
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,621
黑色閃電！
Black Thunder!

76
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,758
- 開始吧 - 戰斗開始咯
- Let's get it on! - Let's get this thing started.

77
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,963
你就這么點能耐？
Is that all you got?

78
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,937
耶！兄弟 干勁拿出來！
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

79
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,282
干掉他 干掉他！
Take him, take him.

80
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,220
突擊者一掌把這只憤怒的牛翻倒在地
Ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.

81
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,155
我還有很多絕招 大家伙 我們才剛暖身
I got more for you, big fella. We're just getting started.

82
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,124
準備 現在 跳
OK. Jump, now!

83
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,804
突擊者一摑掀翻黑色閃電
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

84
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:53,211
但是當你惹毛一只公牛 你就最好小心他們的牛角
but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.

85
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,350
噢 你喜歡是吧！我看得出來 妳喜歡這個
You like that. I can tell. You like that.

86
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,382
轉身小心
Turn around!

87
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,822
里奇！里奇！夠了我們認輸！
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

88
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,874
來吧！我們還要戰斗 跳 跳一下 ！
Come on. We're still in this thing. Just hop. Hop.

89
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,304
就是這樣 來吧！
That's it. Come on.

90
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,976
里奇 夠了！ 我們認輸！
Ricky, enough! Enough!

91
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,249
你的機器人被痛扁的聲音蓋過了你的聲音
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.

92
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,850
殺了他！殺了他！殺了他！
Kill! Kill! Kill!

93
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,387

Charlie男孩 等下我來拿錢 你最好準備好！
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy. You best have it.

106
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,937
- 大家一起喊 "嗨！" - 嗨！
- Everybody say "hey!" - Hey!

107
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,847
- 大家一起喊 "喝！" - 喝！
- Everybody say "ho!" - Ho!

108
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,147
拽不起來了吧？哈哈！小機器人！
How about that? How you doing there, little robot?

109
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,462
我的鑰匙 他媽的！
My keys, damn it.

110
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,364

One more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

111
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:00,874
Charlie 不要緊張
Charlie, relax.

112
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,877
我不會付錢 那是不公平的比賽 甚至花了我最后一個機器人！
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus fight. It cost me my last robot.

113
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,846
- 讓我們先說 - 你還記得卡洛琳法羅嗎？
- Just listen to us. - Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

114
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,419
她是我的前女友 我已經十年沒見過她了 她想干嘛？
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen her in ten years. What does she want?

115
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,248

Yes. As I've already told you, my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

127
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,213

and we can more than provide for Max.

128
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,843
我認為這樣很好 但是根據德州的法律
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will

129
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,887
如果他沒出席的生父Charlie肯頓
next of kin retains custody.

130
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,152
沒有放棄他的撫養權的話
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing,

131
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,556
我們還在等他出席
and we are expecting him...

132
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,294
我要一個新的機器人
I need a new robot now.

133
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,887
我幫突擊者在下周六安排一場大比賽
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.

134
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,296
我現在要趕去處理一件事
I got to show up with something.

135
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,303
大聲公要賣嗎？大聲公是殺手級的！
Noisy Boy is for sale? In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

136
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:39,101
多少錢？很劃算 有沒有其他的毛病？
How much? That's a good deal. What's wrong with him?

137
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,471
我要買
I can live with that.

138
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,277
但是我現在沒有錢
I don't have it.

139
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,441
Charlie肯頓在Max一出生的時候就沒有盡到父親的義務
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.

140
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,179
我們可以更好地照顧Max
I can more than provide for Max.

141
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:54,616
你是Charlie肯頓嗎？
Please be Charles Kenton.

142
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,257
是的 就是Charlie
Charlie, yeah.

143
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,997
我來簽一些文件 放棄一些權力
I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights

144
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,066
放棄我小孩的監護權
to the custody of my son.

145
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,101
所以我才來 我是應該來吧？
That's why I'm here. Do I need to be here?

146
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,465
Charlie
Charlie.

147
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:10,995
你還記得我嗎？
Do you even remember me?

148
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,307
- 黛博拉 卡洛琳的妹妹 - 是哦 黛博拉 你還好嗎？
- Debra, Caroline's sister. - Yeah, Debra. How are you?

149
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,344
肯頓先生 請坐！
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

150
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,942
法官大人 我可以先去看看我的外甥嗎？
Your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?

151
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,076
可以！請去吧！
Yes, you may.

152
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,983
- 你呢？肯頓先生！ - 什么？
- How about you, Mr. Kenton? - What?

153
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,522
如果你想要 你可以跟你兒子獨處一會兒！
You can spend some time with him, if you'd like.

154
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,353
- 跟我兒子？- 是的 你兒子！
- With the kid? - Yeah, the kid.

155
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,359
- Max 你兒子！ - 好的！
- Max. Your son? - All right.

156
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,259
你跟機器人在一起太久了 現在也像機器一樣沒有感情
You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.

157
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,034
寶貝 你在這里等一下 我馬上回來
Honey, you wait right here. I'm going to be back.

158
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,534
甜心 不急 慢慢來！
You take all the time you need, sweetheart.

159
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:50,139
法官大人 如果可以的話 這么重要的事
Your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture,

160
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,942
我想出去一下跟我的律師商量一下！
step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.

161
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,072
當然可以！
Please.

162
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:02,055
來吧！你怎么還不來？
Come on. Come on. There you are.

163
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,687
他會被領養的
He'll be in a foster home.

164
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:10,091
他們會找到一個年輕有活力的家庭的 是的！
No, they find good families. Young. Energetic. Yeah.

165
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,725
感謝你 麥克 我會的 好的
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

166
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,100
- 馬文巴恩 我是黛博拉的先生 - 是哦 耶！
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband. - Right, yeah.

167
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,179
黛博拉是真的很想領養Max
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

168
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,550
- 我是很想完成他的愿望 - 七萬五千元
- I'm up for it. But... - Seventy-five grand.

169
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,744
七萬五千元？你是說真的？
$75,000? You're serious?

170
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,085
還有一件事是...
The thing is...

171
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,289
...我們這個夏天要去意大利度假
we're supposed to go to Italy this summer

172
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,160
跟我最好的朋友及他太太
with my oldest friend and his wife.

173
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,324
二個月都在圖斯卡尼
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

174
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,765
只有你們四個 聽起來不錯！
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

175
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,299
我們八月底才會回來紐約
We'll be back in New York by the end of August.

176
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,267
到八月 那就十萬
In August. A hundred.

177
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,309
- 十萬？- 沒錯
- $100,000? - You heard me.

178
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,641
- 你瘋了嗎？- 沒有比你太太還瘋
- You're crazy. - Not nearly as crazy as your wife

179
00:14:57,746 --> 00:15:01,238
如果我把兒子的撫養權簽給了德州政府
if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.

180
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,013
那么你太太就得不到他想要的
There's a real way everyone gets what they want here.

181
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,247
所以我建議你這樣做
So here's what you're going to do.

182
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,416
你告訴你的太太我只會把撫養權給他
You're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her

183
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,653
如果我能跟我兒子共度一個暑假
if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.

184
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,321
就說我真的很愧疚
Just tell her how guilty she made me feel

185
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,626
我一直沒有盡到父親的責任
for being such a terrible absentee dad,

186
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:22,033
我多想補償小孩一些父親的天倫之樂
how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

187
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:26,073
她會買賬的 然后大家都得到自己想要的
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero and everybody wins.

188
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,707
好吧 但是不準告訴黛伯拉有關錢的事
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?

189
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,343
我了解
I understand.

190
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,646
今晚我們載Max過去的時候 我會先付你五萬塊
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max

191
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,221
然后等我們八月回來 再付你五萬
and the other 50 when we get back in August

192
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,222
而且你要帶他到紐約給我們
and you deliver him to us in New York.

193
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,488
很高興跟你做生意
Pleasure doing business with you.

194
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,593
法官大人 很高興我們都仔細的考慮
Your Honor, I'm happy we all took the time

195
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,325
作出對每個人都好的決定
to make the best decision for everyone.

196
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,364
- 高興嗎？- 是的 是我
- Happy? - Yeah, it's me.

197
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:59,703
我要買下大聲公 我有錢了
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

198
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,470
把它帶到泰利健身房 我等一下就到
Take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.

199
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:18,717
哈?？
Hello?

200
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,324
百麗？
Bailey?

201
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,159
有人在這里等你付錢
Some guy is here with the robot you're buying,

202
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,529
千萬不要放我鴿子
and it smells like disaster to me.

203
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,124
我也很高興見到你
Nice to see you, too.

204
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,137
- 你知道你很可愛嗎？- 少來一套
- Might I also say how cute you look. - Give it up.

205
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,675
天啊 我要沖個涼 你也要嗎？一起來吧！
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower? Come on.

206
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,607
我要說清楚一件事
Let me make something clear.

207
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,612
有個可怕的人帶著個機器人
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

208
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:41,148
坐在健身房門口等我二個小時了
has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.

209
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,150
如果暫時先不考慮這件在我家門口的黑市交易
Putting aside the fact that you're doing

210
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,880
你怎么付這個錢？
what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep,

211
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,156
你不是剛毀了突擊者號？
how will you pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?

212
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,157
錢快到了 安撫他一下！
The money is on its way. Just distract him.

213
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,590
我一直在安撫他 我快累死了！
I have been. It's exhausting.

214
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,627
- 你最好了 - 耶？是嗎？
- You're the best. - Yeah? Really?

215
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,755
那就是你剛買了四萬五千元的機器人但是你還欠我六千的房租？
Is that why you're buying a $45,000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

216
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:58,355
- 因為我最好說話？- 三千
- Because I'm the best? - Three.

217
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:03,700
六千 而且告訴你 已經有人要買下我的地方了
Six. There is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.

218
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,172
少來了 你不會真的想賣掉你老爸留給你的健身房？
Come on. Like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.

219
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,335
如果你不付房租 我也付不出錢 那我就逼不得已了
If you don't make rent, I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.

220
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,379
你父親會從墳墓里面爬起來踢你的
Your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass

221
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,311
- 如果你賣了這個地方 - 我父親會爬出他的墳墓
- if you sold this place. - My father would climb out of his grave

222
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,712
踢你的屁股
and kick your ass.

223
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,443
百麗？
Bailey?

224
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:25,550
- 不要 - 不要做什么？
- Don't. - Don't what?

225
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,219
不要那么做
Don't do that.

226
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,323
- 不要做什么？- 不要做那種小狗表情
- Don't what? - Don't do that thing.

227
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,699
- 不對 你喜歡拳擊 - 不對
- No, you like that thing. - No.

228
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,897
- 是的 - 不對 我不喜歡拳擊
- Yeah. - No, I don't like that thing.

229
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:42,166
我習慣了 簡單地說 但是我現在喜歡錢
I used to. Once. Briefly. Now I like money more.

230
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,871
- 我不相信你 - 我不管
- I don't believe you. - I don't care.

231
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,441
馬文
Marvin.

232
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,511
錢到了
Your money has arrived.

233
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,847
馬文
Marv.

234
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,555
五萬 說好的
Fifty grand, as promised.

235
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:08,631
這個是我們的號碼及我們在歐洲的聯絡方式
Here are all our numbers and contact info over in Europe.

236
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,466
嗯 所以都安排好了
So that's everything there.

237
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:16,241
馬文告訴我你想跟馬克思小聚一段時間
So Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.

238
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,542
- 是的 - 你做的很對
- Yeah. - You did the right thing,

239
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,773
把監護權給我
giving me custody.

240
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,372
卡洛琳也會希望你這么做
Caroline would have wanted that.

241
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:25,313
現在 請八月27號準時帶Max到紐約給我們
Now, have him back in New York on August 27th.

242
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,782
沒問題
That's a deal.

243
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,483
好的 我們去接Max 好的 ？我們去接Max
OK, let's go get Max. OK? Let's get Max.

244
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:39,461
還好嗎？你要到另外一邊 我來帶Max？
It's OK. You want to go around the other side here and I'll get Max?

245
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:44,395
嗨 Max 再見 小老弟
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

246
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,908
親愛的Max 我們暑假過后見
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.

247
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,309
我是Charlie
I'm Charlie.

248
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,819
好久不見了 我是...
It's been a long time. You know, I'm your...

249
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,987
- 你搞死我了 - 嘴巴真干凈
- You screwed me. - Nice mouth.

250
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,355
你知道他們現在要去哪里？
Do you know where they're going?

251
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,398
- 意大利？- 是啊 意大利
- Italy? - Yeah, Italy.

252
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,797
那我為什么要跟你呆在這個鳥地方？
So how did I get stuck here with you?

253
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,802
不要激動 你還有后面一輩子的時間跟他們在一起
Relax, kid. You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.

254
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,928
Charlie
Charlie!

255
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,637
那個老兄氣瘋了 他要走了！
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

256
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,844
- 馬文給你錢了嗎？- 來 剛剛給了
- Did Marvin give you that money? - Here, just close the deal.

257
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:25,573
我等下過去 好嗎？
I'll be right there, OK?

258
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,687
- 我是百麗 - Max

259
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,751
Max 肯頓
Max Kenton.

260
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,018
- 這是你的... - 是的我兒子
- So this is your... - Yeah, it's him.

261
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,625
不要擔心好嗎？
Don't worry about it, OK?

262
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,326
我要照顧你們二個跟...
I'm looking at you two and...

263
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,696
請把大聲公放在店里好嗎？謝謝你！
Just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.

264
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,608
我出去的時候 你跟百麗呆在店里好嗎？
You're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.

265
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,577
- 他給你多少錢？- 你誤會了
- How much did he give you? - You're coming at this the wrong way.

266
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,442
不 告訴我 我要知道
No, tell me. I want to know.

267
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,747
好吧！五萬元
Fifty thousand, OK?

268
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,342
他給我五萬元來讓我放棄你
He gave me $50,000 to sign you over to her.

269
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,853
你可以住嘴嗎？
Will you shut up now?

270
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,682
你把我賣了？
You sold me?

271
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,482
沒有那么糟！
Sounds worse than it is.

272
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:14,357
- 真的？- 那是對你最好的
- Really. - It's to take care of you.

273
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,794
那我要分賬分一半
Give me half the money and you won't have to.

274
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,661
- 你要去哪里？- 把錢給我 我自己會照顧自己
- Where are you going to go? - Give me the money. I'll be fine.

275
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,031
我答應你阿姨 暑假結束的時候會送你去紐約的
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.

276
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,769
現在你只在乎黛博拉阿姨？
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

277
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:26,029
你用五萬把我賣掉 你欠我二萬五
You sold me for 50 grand. You owe me half!

278
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:30,607
我沒有錢 我把錢花在機器人身上 花完了 沒錢了！
I don't have it! I spent the money on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

279
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,009
我完蛋了
I'm through here.

280
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,724
你買了什么？
What do we got?

281
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,587
大聲公到了
Noisy Boy has arrived.

282
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,056
貼滿了海關及航空公司的標簽
That's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.

283
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,799
- 他到過世界的每個角落 - 倫敦 日本 巴西 巴爾的摩...
- He's been all over the world. - London, Japan, Brazil, S鉶 Paulo...

284
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,528
這二年還沒有到過北美
Hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.

285
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,763
或許是因為這樣 價格才那么便宜 天才！
Maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.

286
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,431
決定留下來了？
Decided to stay?

287
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:05,069
百麗會照顧你幾個禮拜
This is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.

288
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,940
這幾周請幫我照顧小孩
I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks.

289
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,848
- 我要一半的錢 - 你還要討論這個？
- I want half that money. - Are we back to this again?

290
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,621
那個是真正的搏擊機器人？
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

291
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:16,418
大聲公 你有沒有聽過它？
Noisy Boy's in there. You ever heard of him?

292
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,017
當然 它在2016年跟羅比肯爭奪世界冠軍
Of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.

293
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,426
老天爺 他看起來太好了！
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

294
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:34,102
它的盔甲已經換過了 我們看看里面的零件是不是一樣好
His composite armor has been replaced. Let's see if the insides look as good.

295
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,936
我已經反復看過他跟羅比肯的比賽快20次了
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.

296
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,843
它實在應該在第三回合擊敗他的
He should have had him in the third round,

297
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,712
但是羅比肯打出一記幸運的右拳 結束了！
but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.

298
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,723
不要激動 他現在是我們的了
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

299
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,825
- 不好玩 - 有點好玩
- Not funny. - Kind of funny.

300
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,528
你知道他有聲控裝置吧？
You know he has voice recognition, right?

301
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,434
- 不 沒有吧？- 他不是普通級別的
- No, he doesn't. - He didn't in the League.

302
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,473
當大聲公在巴西的時候 他們應該裝上的
When Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.

303
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,066
巴西人就是喜歡對機器人說話的那種怪?
Brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

304
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,743
右 左 上擊拳！
Right, left, uppercut!

305
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:20,883
壞掉了！ 右 左 上擊拳！
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

306
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,184
我就知道便宜沒好貨的
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.

307
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,926
- 讓我看看 我來修修看 - 看看它有多好吧！
- Let me see if I can fix it. - Look how good he looks, too.

308
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,018
二秒就好 我看看！
Give me two seconds. Let me look at something!

309
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,496
- 你為什么不驗驗貨？- 不要緊張
- Why didn't you ask to look at it? - Relax!

310
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,501
你是不是用日文？
Was that Japanese?

311
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,101
我看看可不可以切換到英文！
Let me see if I can reset him to English.

312
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,804
你怎么會講日文？
How do you know Japanese?

313
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,506
電視游戲
Video games.

314
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,111
你會玩日文游戲？
You play video games in Japanese?

315
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,947
走私來的日本游戲都比較好的
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

316
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,157
給我吧
Give me that.

317
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,662
已經改到英文模式 而且我找到他的命令集了
He's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.

318
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,994
制造商已經預設了很多的組合拳了
They have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.

319
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,591
他們應該要附個說明書的
They should be listed here.

320
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:10,929
上下擊拳組合
Top salvo!

321
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,168

325
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,156
百麗 幫我裝上車 我要去賺妳的錢了
Bailey, help me put him in the truck. I am going to go and get your money.

326
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,031
- 把鑰匙給我 - 我要跟你一起去

328
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,840
因為我不想讓你去 好嗎？
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

讓我一起去 不然你就只能到下水溝釣你的鑰匙了
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.

Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:03,989
- 不要再那樣做 - 嚇到你了是吧？
- Don't do that again. - That's scaring you, isn't it?

333
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,787
不要再那樣做是嗎？
Don't do this again?

334

00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,905
太簡單了 錢真好賺 整晚都是這樣！
Easy money, easy money all night. All night long!

384
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,173
趕快起來！ 還沒有結束！來吧！
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

385
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,313
面拳齊射！ ！交火！
Skull salvo! Firefight!

386
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:33,076
- 是的！ 上吧 制造噪音吧！！ - 你說卡片 是嗎？
- Yeah! Go, Noisy! - Undercard, huh?

387
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:36,920
激波拳
Shockfist!

388
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,958
來吧！幕府三連擊！
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

389
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,661
干掉他！重力拳 直搗面門
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

390
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,660
真TMD瘋了！
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

391
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,403
金屬的世仇 來吧！
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

392
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,605
左拳！ 痛苦的革命者！
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

393
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,241
讓我給你一個禮物
I got something for you.

394
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,477
你敢逃開？你沒有辦法躲開！
Don't you run from me! You can't run from me!

395
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:10,650
站起來
Get up!

396
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,054
犯規了
That's illegal!

397
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,256
這是地下拳擊 沒有規則的
This is the underworld. There are no rules!

398
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,632
現在我們看邁達斯發飆了
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

399
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,128
不 手舉起來！
No. Hands up!

400
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,296
回到角落來 婊子 像男人一樣大口喘氣
Get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!

401
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,972
他要被干掉了...
He's getting killed in there!

402
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:36,613
用耳機組 告訴它怎么做！
It's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!

403
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,180
恐懼盾牌！
Panic Shield!

404
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,180
對了 對了 一二組合拳！
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

405
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:47,989
不 不 粉碎拳
No, no. Shatter Punch!

406
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,997
- 五連擊 - 嘗嘗這個
- Five Recall! - Get some!

407
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,175
賈布 賈布！
Jab, jab!

408
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:09,608
右環拳！
Right roundhouse!

409
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:13,209
大聲公是不是剛剛把它的機油濺到馬達斯臉上？
Did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?

410
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,983
千萬不可把機油濺到馬達斯臉上
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

411
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,422
讓我們狂歡吧 撞擊宮殿！
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

412
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,618
用你的左拳！
Use your left!

413
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,426
大聲公試著用一只手來對抗
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!

414
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,693
但是邁達斯夾住了他！然后好好的教訓他！
But Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!

415
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,467
不 不 起來！
No, no! Get up!

416
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,267
吃這個！
Get some!

417
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,080
移動！ 離開角落！
Move! Get out of the corner!

418
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,548
邁達斯！邁達斯！邁達斯！
Midas! Midas! Midas!

419
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:48,778
有人已經準備好送上卡布奇諾了！
Somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!

420
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,115
我要送你一個大禮 準備好了？
I got something for you! You ready?

421
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:56,463
晚安！邁達斯的最后一擊！
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

422
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,397
再見吧 大聲公！
And so long to Noisy Boy.

423
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,263
太遜了 你餓了嗎？
That sucked. You hungry?

424
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,136
我救回了大聲公的聲控控制面板
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.

425
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,105
除了那個以外 已經變垃圾了 我要再找一個新機器人
Other than that, he's trash. I got to get a new robot together.

426
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,836
我需要一個主機 什么？
I need to find a mainframe. What?

427
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,374
- 我不喜歡漢堡 - 什么樣的小孩不喜歡漢堡？
- I hate hamburgers. - What kid hates burgers?

428
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,779
好吧 我可以多吃一些 這個給你喝
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

429
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,641
你根本不該參加那場打斗的
You never should have taken that fight.

430
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,118
真的？真的？多謝你 天才！
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

431
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,520
你總是那么的沖動嗎？
Do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?

432
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,819
你根本不知道怎么戰斗
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

433
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,426
你知道的組合拳碼根本不到一半
Those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.

434
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,260
你的狂妄自大害的它的屁股被踢成二半
You threw them in there cocky and half-assed.

435
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,800
- 你根本沒有給他機會 - 大聲公沒有那么棒！
- You never gave him a chance. - He wasn't that good.

436
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,535
大聲公是最好的機器人
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

437
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,435
曾經是 曾經是 大聲公以前是很好 以前是
Was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.

438
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,533
但是看看周圍 這里是偉大的機器人毀掉的墳場
But look around you. This place is where once great robots go to die.

439
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,202
那就丟掉它？
So throw him away.

440
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:21,406
這就是你 是吧？你不需要的 就丟掉？
That's what you do, right? Anything you don't need you throw away.

441
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,610
哇
Wow.

442
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,418
這會是漫長的一夜
It's been a long night.

443
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,718
如果你要在里面睡 閉嘴 上車！
If you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.

444
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,690
不要這樣看著我 上車！
Don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!

445
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,152
他們花400買大聲公的頭
They gave me 400 for his head.

446
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,334
你坐好 我要去找一些零件！
You stay put. I'm going to look for parts.

447
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,471
我也要去 那個飲料讓我很興奮
I'm coming with you. That drink has my heart pounding.

448
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,709
如果我自己坐在車里 我的頭會炸掉
If I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.

449
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,409
隨便你 但是要跟好
Whatever. Just keep up.

450
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,427
真背
Crap.

451
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,829
退后
Stay back.

452
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,339
好了 跟上！
All right, keep up.

453
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,476
這個探照燈是定時的 你只要知道時間間隔就好
These searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right,

454
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,642
所以跟緊
so stay close.

455
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:09,514
那就對了！
It's all right.

456
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,922
來吧 快點！
Come on, come on.

457
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,429
- 我們會被抓啦！ - 來啦！
- We're going to get caught. - Come on.

458
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,264
慢一點 小心一點
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

459
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,564
快一點 下來這里 快快快
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

460
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,406
機器人都在東邊 我們要快一點通過這里
Robots are on the east side. We got to be quick in here.

461
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:33,670
過了這里就沒有探照燈了 快 跑！
Once we're through here, there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

462
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,530
- 到了 - 我們要找什么？
- Here it is. - What are we looking for?

463
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,261
可以組合機器人的任何東西
Anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.

464
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,394
- 嗨 你看 - 什么？
- Hey, look. - What?

465
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,531
太小了
It's so small.

466
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:03,371
耶 那個比你還要老
Yeah. That's before your time.

467
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,571
那個是第一代的戰斗機器人
That's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.

468
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,878
他們被造的很像人類 越像越好
They wanted them to look like us. The more human, the better.

469
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,782
沒想到變得那么快 把這個放進拖車
Crazy how quick everything changed. Put that in the cart.

470
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:16,015
- 什么改變了？- 好問題 人類的拳擊
- What changed? - A good question. Human boxing.

471
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,292
- 已經退流行了 - 為什么？
- It just faded. - Why?

472
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,624
因為金錢改變了一切 人們要更血腥 更好看
Because the money moved on. People wanted more carnage, more show.

473
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,825
可以綜合巴西柔術 格雷西 日式忍者術
You had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados,

474
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,301
泰拳...幾千種不同的武術糅合在一起
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and a thousand styles in between.

475
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:31,735
全部在水泥地上的重擊
Full-on ground-and-pound.

476
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,067
- 看看這個 - 這是什么？
- Look at this. - What's that?

477
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,534
我也不知道
I don't know.

478
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:35,904
不錯的零件
Not bad. Good spot.

479
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,041
如果還是一個拳手 人類的身體
You still had human fighters, human bodies,

480
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,577
你沒有辦法給人們他們想要的
so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:

481
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,946
真相是 沒有圍欄的暴力 這就是人們想要的
True, no-holds-barred violence.

482
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,781
所以符合邏輯的下一步
The next logical step,

483
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,017
把人們移開 讓機器來自相殘殺
get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.

484
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,517
你會想念真正的拳擊嗎？
Do you miss it?

485
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,524
- 拳擊 你想念嗎？- 小心
- Boxing. Do you miss it? - Careful.

486
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,067
什么？我想知道
What? I want to know.

487
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,929
小心一點 你下面是個峭壁
Careful, you're on a cliff.

488
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,643
那下面很深 如果你掉下去 你就絕對...
That's a long way down. If you fell, you'd definitely...

489
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,412
Charlie 救我！
Charlie, help me!

490
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,014
Charlie！
Charlie!

491
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,080
- Charlie！ - Max！
- Charlie! - Max! Max!

492
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,045
Max！
Max!

493
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:01,587
- 不要動！ - 有一個機器人的手勾住了我
- Try not to move! - I'm on some sort of robot arm.

494
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,723
等一下！ 不要動 千萬不要動 把手伸過來 慢一點 輕一點
Wait! Just easy, easy. Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

495
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:10,167
要很慢很慢 很好 不要看下面 看著我 看著我 ！
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down. Look at me. Look at me.

496
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:14,168
就是這樣！ 我抓住你了！不用怕了 我抓住你了
That's it! I've got you! You don't have to be scared. I got you!

497
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,773
- 下面好深啊 - 沒問題了 我抓住你了！
- It's so far! - It's OK. I got you.

498
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,175
把手給我 慢一點 輕一點
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

499
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,840
只要動你的手 把你的手伸過來 慢慢的 遞過來
Just give me your other hand very slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

500
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,580
看著我 我們一起來
Look at me. We're going to do this together.

501
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,885
就是你跟我 看著我 對的！
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

502
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:35,451
一 二 三！
One... two... three!

503
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:42,765
就是這樣 我抓住你了 我抓住你了！
That's it. I got you! I got you. I got you. I got you.

504
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,672
你安全了 你安全了！
You're safe. You're safe.

505
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,880
沒事了 我抓住你了
All right, I got you.

506
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,542
- 你還好嗎？- 還好
- You all right? - Yeah.

507
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:01,052
過來這里 慢一點 慢一點
Come here. Easy. Easy.

508
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,188
你還好嗎？
You all right?

509
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,823
- 你還好嗎？- 是的
- You all right? - Yeah.

510
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,860
我告訴你很危險了
I told you it was dangerous.

511
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,186
小心一點 我們還在懸崖邊上
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

512
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,204
Charlie 我看到一整個機器人了
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.

513
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,776
那又怎么樣？走吧！來吧
So what? Let's go. Come on.

514
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,516
我要帶走它 他救了我一命！
I'm taking him with me. He saved my life.

515
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,951
他沒有救你一命 是我救得 走吧！
He did not save your life. I saved your life. Let's go.

516
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:37,046
把推車推到邊上 我會用卷線拉上去！
Just bring the cart to the edge. I'll use the winch to get him out.

517
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:40,685
你要撿這個垃圾 你自己推車 我不玩了
You want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.

518
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,291
這是大聲公剩下的零件？
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

519
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,625
是的
That's it.

520
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,296
他的頭已經變成撞擊宮殿大門上的裝潢了
His head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.

521
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,669
- 正經一點 - 我們再做一個機器人
- It's not funny. - Let's get a robot, you and me.

522
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:38,904
好點子 只不過你破產了 我也快了
Good idea. You're broke. I'm almost there myself.

523
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,880
- 你搞砸了你最好的一次機會了 - 我們可以一起做出來的
- You destroyed the best shot you had. - We'll put one together.

524
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,210
你是那么聰明 這里又有那么多好零件
You're brilliant at this. There's good stuff here.

525
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,649
- 這里什么都沒有 - 有啊 你看！
- There's nothing here. - There is. Look.

526
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,722
這些都是垃圾... 垃圾
All your junk is... it's junk.

527
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,918
你甚至已經沒有辦法參加比賽了
You're not even in the game any more.

528
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,961
- 都是垃圾 - 我知道了 都是垃圾
- It's all garbage. - I heard you. It's garbage.

529
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,825
不要對我大聲
Don't get loud with me.

530
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,831
- 這是你自己的麻煩 - 你這是什么意思？
- You're your problem. - What's that supposed to mean?

531
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,834
我已經在這里幫你很長一段時間了
I have been here for you a long time.

532
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,702
臺上 臺下 還有這個物價上升 已經煩夠了
In the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

533
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:09,867
我父親投資所有的財產支持你的拳擊 我們愛...
My father invested everything he had in your fight career. We loved...

534
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:16,213
他把你當成自己親人來照顧 這里是他的家
He loved you like family. And this is his home.

535
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:19,681
我努力的維持住這個家 讓他不要破碎！
I'm just trying not to let it die. That's my plan.

536
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,252
你呢？
What's yours?

537
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,796
你放棄了 是吧？
You're done, right?

538
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:40,738
你終于放棄了？因為我真的TMD確定 Charlie
You're finally done? Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

539
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,275
我什么都沒有了
I got nothing left.

540
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,336
好吧
All right.

541
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,679
或許這里面還有點東西
Maybe there's something here.

542
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:55,821
昨天晚上小鬼帶回來的機器人 你可以幫我看看嗎？
This robot the kid brought in last night. Would you look at it for me?

543
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,381
拜托！
Please?

544
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:10,999
我從沒有看過這一型的機器人 它應該是第二代的
I've never seen anything like it before. He's Generation Two, but barely.

545
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:15,769
我找到一個適合他的電池 然后我用舊型的G-2 無線連上他
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

546
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:18,003
你可以讓他動起來 但是他還是垃圾
You can move him around, but he's crap.

547
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:21,047
或許我可以安排幾個拳擊表演 賺個幾千塊
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.

548
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,342
住手
Stop.

549
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,144
這是我的機器人
It's my robot!

550
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:27,948
它花了我大半夜 辛苦的把它挖出來 他是我的
It took me half the night dragging him out of there. He's mine.

551
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:31,718
他是你的？但是用來修好他的零件是我的！
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts we're putting in him are mine!

552
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:36,292
你們二個白癡先不要吵 看看通電以后是什么樣子
You idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.

553
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,864
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

554
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,217
小心一點 退后
Watch out. Stay back.

555
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:19,804
看來它有一個映射功能 那是很罕見的
Looks like he's got a shadow function. That's pretty rare.

556
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,975
他可以模仿你的動作 記憶起來
He can mime your movements and store them in memory.

557
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,944
- 有沒有什么是我們可以利用的？- 我看是沒有
- Is there anything here we could use? - Not much.

558
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,104
哪里有個水桶...
There's a bucket...

559
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,475
有個我用來洗車的水桶
There's a bucket I use to wash the truck.

560
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,480
用來把它洗干凈 它聞起來像大便
Use it and clean him up. He smells like crap.

561
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:36,483
也把你自己洗一洗 你聞起來也像大便
Wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.

562
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,953
我把它調到最基本的無線功能
I switched him to remote. It's pretty basic.

563
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,358
用繩子拴住他 帶著他
Just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.

564
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,964
- 你玩電動游戲 是吧？- 當然
- You play video games, right? - Of course.

565
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:48,899
一樣的概念 只是它是個一千磅的機器人
Same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.

566
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,460
酷
Cool.

567
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,269
"Atom"
"Atom."

568
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,016
他的名字叫“ATOM” 我們可以讓他參加格斗嗎？
His name is Atom. Can we get him a fight?

569
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:38,414
他不是戰斗型的機器人
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.

570
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,546
他是第二代的 2014年建造的 用來表演拳擊的
He's a G-2, built in early 2014. He was a sparring bot.

571
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,118
他們是建造來鏡像...
They must have built robots like this one

572
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:46,283
其他戰斗型的機器人
that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.

573
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:48,554
好的 我們可以讓他參加格斗？
OK, so can we get him a fight?

574
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:51,353
你有沒有在聽？它是表演機器人
Are you not listening? He's a sparring bot.

575
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:54,161
它是可以承受很多撞擊 但是承受不了真正的大力一擊
Built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.

576
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,929
你可以當成零件賣掉它
You could always sell him off for parts.

577
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:59,403
- 我們可不可以讓他參加格斗？- "你為什么要讓他參加格斗？"
- Can't you get him a fight? - "Why can't you get him a fight?"

578
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,303
天啊 你就是不放棄是吧？
God, you don't quit, do you?

579
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:04,343
你要我幫他放到格斗場 格斗祭 然后害死他？
You want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

580
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:07,379
我看你在撞擊宮殿里面是那么害怕
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.

581
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:11,645
可以讓你參加格斗的地方會讓你嚇到尿褲子
The places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your pants.

582
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:14,216
好極了 帶他去格斗
Excellent. Get him a fight.

583
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,351
頑固的孩子
Stubborn kid.

584
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:23,361
驚喜嗎？
Surprise, surprise.

585
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:06,095
我們散散步
Let's take a walk.

586
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,200
你聽得懂我說的嗎？
Can you understand me?

587
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,315
別擔心 我會保密的
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

588
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,176
你認識Charlie非常久了
You've known Charlie a long time.

589
00:48:56,216 --> 00:48:59,515
很久了 我們一起在健身房長大的
Too long. We both kind of grew up in this gym.

590
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,752
我父親是他的教練
My dad, he trained him.

591
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:06,624
那是他們 那是Charlie
That's them. That's Charlie.

592
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,187
- 他是什么樣子？- 當拳手的時候？
- What was he like? - As a boxer?

593
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,493
- 年輕的時候 - 他很不簡單
- As anything. - He was something.

594
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,331
他很瘦 強硬
He was lean, tough.

595
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,337
永不放棄 不會恐懼
No quit, no fear.

596
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:25,769
來這里 我讓你看看
Come here. I want to show you something.

597
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:31,645
給你看看2007年在鳳凰城的報導
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007

598
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,518
當Charlie跟尼克康迪決戰的時候 那是他的巔峰
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.

599
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,146
你也有看那場拳賽？
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

600
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:41,250
有的 Charlie本來只是熱身的對手 應該是很容易被揍扁的
I was. Charlie was supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

601
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:44,660
尼克本來是應該連汗都不流一滴的
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat, but...

602
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:50,301
但是Charlie沒那么想 他一步一步的逼近尼克
nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.

603
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,701
結果你知道嗎？
Check this out.

604
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:55,867
這就是Charlie
That's Charlie.

605
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:00,474
一開始尼克不敢相信這個無名小卒會那么有膽識
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.

606
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,279
但是Charlie決不后退 尼克開始害怕了
But Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.

607
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,216
- 真的？- 是真的
- Really? - Really.

608
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,878
變成Charlie在玩弄尼克
He was toying with Nico.

609
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:11,680
這個世界排名第二名的拳手
The top contender, number two in the world,

610
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,851
Charlie像飛舞的蝴蝶玩弄著他
and Charlie was dancing with him.

611
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:18,689
Charlie整晚的腳步就像漂浮在拳擊臺上那么順
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.

612
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,700
就像鬼魂一樣 尼克根本看不到他
He was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.

613
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:24,501
我看得到
I could.

614
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:28,504
腳步是那么完美
He was beautiful.

615
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:30,873
就是那么完美
He was beautiful.

616
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,581
后來呢？Charlie擊敗尼克了？
So what happened? Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

617
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:40,449
不 尼克在第12回合揍扁了我 二次！
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.

618
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:42,419
第二次倒下 我被打暈了 再也站不起來！
Second time for good. Lights out.

619
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:43,819
當時計分板上 你是領先的！
You were ahead on the scorecards

620
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,251
- 一直到第12回合 - 結果第12回合 尼克擊倒我
- going into the 12th round. - Nico Tandy rung my bell

621
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,260
后面三年他都是世界拳王
and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.

622
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:51,387
- 他擊倒你？- 是的 還有很多人擊倒我
- He knocked you out? - Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

623
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:52,795
你也擊倒很多人啊！
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

624
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:57,359
- 24 場19勝 大概是這樣 - 但是勝場都是擊倒勝
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career. - But every fight a knockout.

625
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,870
- 是的 - 贏或輸 沒有平手
- Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over

626
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:00,639
- 直到一方倒下 - 直到一方倒下
- till someone's on the mat. - Till someone's on the mat.

627
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,265
- 你父親教我的 - 沒錯 他教你的
- Your old man taught me that. - Damn straight he taught you that.

628
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,503
- 你還有跟誰比過？- 去收拾你的東西
- Who else did you fight? - Go get your stuff together.

629
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,546
我收好了 你有任何排名嗎？
I don't need to. Did you fight for the title?

630
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,208
你還要再收拾！我們再一個小時就出發了 去收拾！
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

631
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,876
哇 還你！
Wow. Here.

632
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,347
你留著吧
Keep it.

633
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:20,185
- 謝謝！ - 不客氣！
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

634
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:26,495
我喜歡Max
I like that kid.

635
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,697
他也喜歡你
He likes you.

636
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:37,234
- 我昨天晚上說的... - 不 一切盡在不言中
- What I said yesterday was... - No, nothing more to say.

637
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:40,470
我今天晚上會到亞特蘭大市
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

638
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,777
看看可不可以找到合伙人 募點錢 買個新的...
to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.

639
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:48,821
這是你想要的吧 ？我走？
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

640
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,427
是啊 這是我想要的
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

641
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:04,827
好的
OK.

642
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:13,077
翻譯：閑閑的猛男 校對：目前沒有

643
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:23,344
“百麗來電”--拒接來電

644
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,000
趕快看
Look.

645
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:51,910
拳王在這里 宙斯在這里比賽
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

646
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,645
耶
Yeah.

647
00:52:55,689 --> 00:53:01,127
沒有人能夠跟這個怪獸打二個回合
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster. Two rounds!

648
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:04,489
拳王交出他的冠軍腰帶 準備保衛戰
The champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.

649
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,589
可能他今天晚上會遇到一場真正的較量
He just may have a real fight on his hands.

650
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,002
最后 還是宙斯贏了 最強的終極格斗機器人 晚安！
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever. End of story. Good night!

651
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,467
- 太酷了 真是太酷了 - 你說什么？
- So cool. It's so cool. - What?

652
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:19,602
來吧
Come on.

653
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:24,574
聽好 我要去找芬尼
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

654
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,481
你要乖乖呆在這一區
I want you to stay in this area.

655
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,622
不要擋路 拳王來了 讓開路
Out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.

656
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:32,351
走開走開 拳王要過來了
Move, move. Champ coming through.

657
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:47,665
法拉蘭蔻娃 宙斯是屬于他父親的
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father/daughter Zeus team.

658
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:51,437
大家說你父親只是出錢 你才是宙斯的領導者
They say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.

659
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:53,435
你太客氣了
You're very kind,

660
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:57,482
但是我要提醒你 松本先生才是宙斯真正的領導者！
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

661
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:02,085
是什么吸引了這個隱居的天才 這個天才神童
What did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

662
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,552
然后投入這個最重要的大賽的格斗機器人
and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport

663
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,092
為什么有辦法讓他再出山？
out of retirement?

664
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,519
為什么你不自己問問他？
Why don't you ask him yourself?

665
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,927
宙斯是不是松本先生最偉大的設計？
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

666
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:23,633
宙斯是不斷的可以在戰斗中自主學習型的機器人
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.

667
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,768
他有非常強的適應能力
With his adaptive operating system,

668
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:30,839
他可以隨時的辨識對手的戰斗模式 即時更新自己的模式
he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.

669
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:35,547
對于我及喬派克的理解 你是說宙斯......
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus?

670
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:39,921
我是說不管在場上發生什么事...
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring...

671
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:44,127
...結果都是一樣的
the result of any fight is inevitable.

672
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:46,922
宙斯只會...
What Zeus sees...

673
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:49,798
...神擋殺神 鬼擋殺鬼！
he kills.

674
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:52,962
太好了
Sweet.

675
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:23,535
我絕對不會投資你的生意
I'm never going into business with you.

676
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:24,864
我只需要一點小幫助
I just need a break here.

677
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:27,735
你不是還有一臺舊卡車 不是還有機器人在里面
You got that old bot truck out there. You always got something in there.

678
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:30,435
我有一個表演用的機器人 不值錢的
I got an old sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.

679
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:32,010
我現在還能怎么辦？
What am I supposed to do with that?

680
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:34,876
帶他到動物園 動物園明天有比賽
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo. They fight there tomorrow.

681
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:37,006
在動物園我只會被干掉
Even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.

682
00:55:37,117 --> 00:55:39,017
我只需要借一點錢
I just need a little loan.

683
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,680
什么？
What?

684
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:44,555
- Charlie 你是認真的嗎？- 借一筆錢
- You're serious, Charlie? - A loan.

685
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:46,818
幾百 幾千 都可以 只要你愿意借
Couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.

686
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:49,453
我知道你有錢可以借給我
You know I'm good for it.

687
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:53,191
我很了解你 老兄 我很喜歡你的人
I know you, and as much as I like you, dude...

688
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,061
...只是 你實在是一個不會賭的人 兄弟
you're a bad bet, brother.

689
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:01,065
太好了 耶
Right, yeah.

690
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,652
你有沒有看到？艾克洛德只剩下那一半...
Did you see that? That's what's left of Axelrod.

691
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:25,628
你跑去哪里了？不是告訴你不要亂跑
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

692
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,962
你應該要看看宙斯 太神奇了！
You should have seen him. Zeus was, like, amazing!

693
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,058
- 神奇 阿？- 不敢相信 耶
- Amazing, huh? - Unbelievable, yeah.

694
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,504
他接二連三的打擊艾克洛德 很快的 太厲害了
He was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

695
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,065
艾克洛德一拳也沒有打中宙斯 也撐不過一個回合
Axelrod didn't even land a punch. He didn't even survive the first round.

696
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:39,270
你以為拳擊就是這樣？
Is that what you think boxing is?

697
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:41,604
宙斯的比賽都是“安排”好的
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?

698
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:44,615
艾克洛德只是一塊鐵 拳賽已經變得是那么低劣了
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel. And that is what boxing is now.

699
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:47,185
你連這個都不知道 我喜愛這個比賽 而且我還是圈內人
Deal with it. And I love it, and I'm in it now.

700
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,513
你還在圈內？你跟你的舊第二代機器人？
You're in it now, are you? You and your G-2 sparring bot?

701
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:53,956
他很厲害的 幫我們安排比賽 你就會知道
He's more than that. If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

702
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,086
好的 你很幸運 有個地方叫做野獸園
You're in luck, kid. There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

703
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:58,960
明天下午 你可以參加格斗
Tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.

704
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:01,533
- 很好 - 然后我們就徹底完蛋了
- Great. - And it will be the end.

705
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:04,866
我告訴你我不喜歡漢堡
I told you I hate hamburgers!

706
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:09,868
是墨西哥卷餅啦
It's a burrito!

707
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,545
右上勾拳
Right uppercut.

708
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:24,920
左上勾拳
Left uppercut.

709
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,562
蹲低一點 舉起你的雙手
Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

710
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:37,794
再來一次 蹲下 舉起你的雙手
Again. Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

711
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:40,134
你這樣一整晚？
You been up all night?

712
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,764
是的 我把它清理了一下
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

713
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,174
我用動作映射功能教他一點格斗技 然后同步到遙控器里面
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.

714
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,714
是的 我看到你教他的雙上擊拳
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.

715
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:51,010
這是絕招
That's lethal stuff.

716
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:52,277
走吧 我們去格斗吧！
Let's do this.

717
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,578
吃早餐先吧
Let's do breakfast first.

718
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,793
你知道等下他就會被拆成碎片吧？
You know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?

719
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,089
等下你就知道
We'll see.

720
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,207
- 讓我來！ - Charlie肯頓 這是馬克思！
- Let me deal with this. - Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

721
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,140
首腦 叫我首腦
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

722
00:58:51,244 --> 00:58:53,838
- 好吧！首腦 那么... - 一回合我們可以賺多少錢呢？
- All right, Kingpin, so... - How much a round?

723
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,642
我們正在巡回比賽
We on a field trip?

724
00:58:57,817 --> 00:59:00,217
可以你可以跟我的機器人 Metro對打
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

725
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,117
二分鐘 一回合 一百元
I'll give you a hundred bucks for one two-minute round.

726
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:03,654
- 接受它 - 三百
- Take it. - Three hundred.

727
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:07,248
一百元 小男孩 給你一百元是為了Metro練練
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

728
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:10,025
何不500元打二個回合？
How about 500 for two rounds?

729
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,696
二個回合？小鬼 你的機器人連一個回合都撐不過
Two rounds. Son, he ain't going to survive one round.

730
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,235
- 如果它可以呢？- 它沒辦法的
- What if he does? - He ain't.

731
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:19,962
讓我們先假設它可以
Let's just say he does.

732
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:25,139
如果第一回合結束 他還能站著...
If he's still standing after one round...

733
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,840
...我就給你一千元
I'll give you a thousand bucks.

734
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,039
閉嘴！
Shut it!

735
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:36,385
但是如果他 我看是一定毀在那里 年輕人...
But if he dies in there, which he will, junior...

736
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,759
...剩下的零件都歸我了
I get to keep what's left.

737
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,761
一百元的賭注就好...
Take the hundred.

738
00:59:44,263 --> 00:59:45,321
沒問題
Deal.

739
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:48,996
成局了 比賽開始！
We're on. We on!

740
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,295
走吧！
Let's go!

741
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:55,772
- 你應該接收100元的賭注的 - 我幫我們爭取更好的 1000元
- You should have taken the hundred. - I got us a thousand.

742
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,172
是啊 如果它贏得了
Yeah, if he wins.

743
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:24,435
你要我來操作嗎？
You want me to drive?

744
01:00:24,737 --> 01:00:26,170
他是我的機器人 我自己操作！
He's my bot. I got this!

745
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:29,469
在這里的是真正的比賽 不是電動游戲
This ain't a video game. This is for real. Right here.

746
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:32,939
你不是說他會被拆碎？那誰操作有差嗎？
You said he's coming home in pieces. What difference does it make?

747
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,206
好吧！隨便你！
All right.

748
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:37,274
我來就好！
I got this.

749
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,783
開始吧 開始吧！
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

750
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,447
讓我們像在香港打乒乓球那樣修理他吧！
Let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

751
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,316
敲響鈴聲 敲鈴吧！
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

752
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,896
不要看著Atom注意你的對手
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

753
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:03,237
注意他的腳 他要用腳釘住你
Watch out for that foot. He's looking to pin you.

754
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:07,205
我告訴你要小心那個踩腳的賤招數
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.

755
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,777
注意！大榔頭要來了
Here comes the sledgehammer.

756
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:16,982
有沒有看到？
Did you see that?

757
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,355
- 來吧！ 控制他！ - 不要吼他 控制好他
- Come on! Get him! - Don't yell at him, control him.

758
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,360
滑到右邊 退后！
Slip right. Back step.

759
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:24,255
低頭
Duck.

760
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:26,831
- 不客氣 - 閉嘴！ 你在幫倒忙！
- You're welcome. - Shut up! You're not helping!

761
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,957
事實上 我認為我才對
Actually, I think I am.

762
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:34,203
后腦 你要快一點 移動快一點 屈膝
Backhand. You got speed on this guy. Just keep moving. Bob.

763
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:42,845
避開角落 不停移動 迂回前進
Slip out of that corner. Keep moving! Bob and weave!

764
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:46,979
就是這樣！總算聽懂我說的了
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

765
01:01:57,029 --> 01:02:00,226
你的機器人真能挨揍 我告訴你 你的機器人很耐打
He can take a hit. I'll give you this. Your bot can take a hit.

766
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,133
你最好避開那個鎖頭 這個會對你是個大麻煩
You better slip that headlock. This ain't gonna end well for you.

767
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,262
我在躲！

30... 半分鐘！
Thirty... Half a minute.

770
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:22,080
半分鐘！ 不停移動！ 不要停下來！
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

771
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:26,987
只要再撐20秒
You've got 20 seconds!

772
01:02:28,294 --> 01:02:31,024
- 再撐20秒就賺了1000元 讓我來操作！ - 不要！
That's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

773
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,889
移動 然后 移動！
Move, then. Move!

774
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:41,303
不會吧！

Count with me! Count with me! One!

777
01:02:48,114 --> 01:02:51,311
- 起來！ - 你知道你是在對一個機器說話吧？
- Get up! - You know you're talking to a machine?

778
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:53,942

Yes! Yes!

782
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:08,931
我來搞定！

783
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,936
我來搞定 來吧！現在！
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

784
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,438
- 這里有一千元... - 耶 一千
- This thousand bucks... - Yeah, thousand.

785
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,371
全壓 壓他打不完第二回合！
Double or nothing he can't make another round.

786
01:03:16,475 --> 01:03:18,170
- 耶 不用了 謝謝！ - 接受！全壓 再奧下去！
- Yeah, thanks anyway. - Deal. Double or nothing.

787
01:03:18,277 --> 01:03:20,609
小男孩說了！ 再來！ 開始咯！
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

788
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:23,211
你瘋了嗎？你剛剛丟了1000元？
Are you crazy? You threw away a thousand bucks!

789
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:25,341
他只是勉強支持住
He can barely stand up in there.

790
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:28,147
我真的很需要這筆錢
Look. I really need the money.

791
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,489
我知道 我來處理！
I know. Let's work.

792
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:34,250
天啊！
Jesus.

793
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:42,025
- 小心！踩腳賤招！ - 我看到了！
- Watch that. Watch that. - I got that.

794
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:57,672
- 我控制住了 - 它的系統崩潰了
- I got it. - That's a system failure!

795
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:01,115
- 失控了！ - 他要倒下了！
- I don't got it. - He's going down.

796
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:07,718
- 耶！ - 不！
- Yes! - No!

797
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:11,486
開始倒數！
Start the count!

798
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,996
開始倒數！
Start the count!

799
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,535
1 2 3！
One! Two! Three!

800
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:20,663
4 5 6 7！

你辦到了！ 我們辦到了！哇！
You did it! We did it! Wow!

804
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:36,248
該走了 來吧 帶上你的機器人！
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

805
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:41,015
我知道 我知道 我知道！
I know, I know! I know! I know!

806
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,651
首腦 付錢吧！
Kingpin, pay up.

807
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,022
好吧！好吧！好吧！我知道！我知道！
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.

808
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,498
- 我們贏了！ - 走吧！趕快走！
- We owned! - Let's go. Come on, come on.

809
01:04:49,735 --> 01:04:51,566
- 耶？- 我有沒有幫你安排過比賽？
- Yeah? - Have I got a fight for you.

810
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:56,267
一場比賽四千 如果贏了七千 周六晚上！
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand. Seven if he wins.

811
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:58,309
四千？沒問題 我們走吧！
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

812
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,559
翻譯：閑閑的猛男 校對：目前沒有

813
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:10,783
百麗 是我 Atom贏了
Bailey, it's me. He won.

814
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:14,185
你相信嗎？小鬼的機器人真的贏了！
Can you believe that? The kid's robot actually won.

815
01:05:16,095 --> 01:05:17,289
我知道！
I know.

816
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,025
高興嗎？天啊！耶！
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

817
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:24,500
Atom被揍了 被揍的很慘！
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

818
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:29,331
但是...
Anyway...

819
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,340
我只是希望讓你知道
I just wanted you to know.

820
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:09,213
刺拳 刺拳 勾拳！
Jab, jab, hook.

821
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,413
刺拳 刺拳 勾拳！
Jab, jab, hook.

822
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:19,119
我認為你還要移動你的雙腿
I think you have to move your feet.

823
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:25,654
你的雙腿
Your feet. Feet.

824
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:46,943
漂亮的動作 小鬼！
Nice moves, kid.

825
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,612
你整晚沒有睡？
How long you been out here?

826
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,177
你看看！
Check it out.

827
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:55,583
我整晚沒睡做了一件了不起的事
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.

828
01:07:55,688 --> 01:07:57,622
完全不可思議的事 然后搞定了
Incredibly amazing. If it works, you know?

829
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:00,687
- 你知道他的遙控器很臟了 - 是的
- You know his remote was spotty? - Yeah.

830
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:03,887
我丟掉了 不用了 我們不需要了！
I killed it. Got rid of it. We don't need it any more.

831
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:05,356
不會吧你？
How did you?

832
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,729
我想要重新再輸入！
I had to start over.

833
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,529
所以我用突擊者號的中心控制板
But I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush

834
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:13,298
然后把大聲公的聲控板移過去
and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy,

835
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:14,463
成功了！
and it works.

836
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:17,667
他現在資料庫空了 但是更好用了！
He knows nothing, but it works. It really, really works.

837
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:18,868
什么更好用了？
What works?

838
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:21,776
讓我打開給你看！
I got to turn it on.

839
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,883
左刺拳 右上鉤拳！
Left jab, right uppercut!

840
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:28,977
日式！
Japan!

841
01:08:29,288 --> 01:08:31,756
你把大聲公的聲控模式移植到Atom身上？
You put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?

842
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,950
- 非常聰明 小鬼！ - 聰明？
- Pretty smart, kid. - Smart?

843
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,522
我是天才！
It could be genius!

844
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:38,392
那個是世界上最聰明的事
It could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!

845
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:41,523
不要那么興奮 你把所有的汽水都喝完了？
Easy there, chief. Did you drink all these sodas?

846
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:44,694
我喝了一些 我需要你教Atom拳擊
I might have had a few. I need you to teach him to box.

847
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:48,830
你不要開玩笑了？他沒有那個級數去使出大聲公的組合動作
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

848
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,239
所以他需要你的動作 你的組合
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

849
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:53,777
- 從腳步動作開始 - 別想了
- Start over from the ground up. - Forget it.

850
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,676
你曾經是一個拳擊手
You were a boxer.

851
01:08:55,781 --> 01:09:00,377
昨天你在野獸園 可以清清楚楚的研判他們的動作
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.

852
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:02,716
我已經很久沒有打拳了 也不想再打了！
I haven't boxed in a long time. I'm not starting now.

853
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:05,381
- 那誰來教它打拳？- 你就教的不錯啊！
- Who's going to teach him to fight? - You're doing fine.

854
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:07,391
不需要我來教！對不起！
You don't need me. Sorry.

855
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:13,689
但是話說回來 那個舞步很酷
That was really cool, though, that dance.

856
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,797
我們周六晚上應該跳一下那個舞
You should do that on Saturday night.

857
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,697
- 不要取笑我 - 我是說真格的！
- Don't make fun of me. - I'm serious.

858
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:22,638
在比賽前 在你們進入場地的時候 你們應該跳的1
Before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.

859
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,972
我才不想在拳擊觀眾面前跳舞的
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.

860
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:29,475
不會吧你？這一切都只是場秀！
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

861
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,743
人們想看到一些從所未有的
People want to see something they've never seen.

862
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,546
你看 所有偉大的拳手！
Look. You think of all the greats.

863
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:37,451
像阿里 甜心雷 雷金王子 加瑪...
Think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer,

864
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:39,353
他們都有他們的措號
they all had their nicknames.

865
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:42,484
他們都有天分 特質...
They had their personae. They all had flair.

866
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,998
你呢？雖然你的機器人不起眼 但是如果你會跳舞 這就是你的特質
Now you? You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.

867
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:50,564
而且 你是小孩 人們總是喜歡小孩玩意的
Plus, you're a kid. People love that kid thing.

868
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,467
- 你幾歲？九歲？十歲？- 我十一歲了
- What are you? Like nine? Ten? - I'm 11.

869
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:55,335
你確定？
Are you sure you're 11?

870
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:58,572
是的 我確定我十一歲！
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

871
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:02,875
不管了 重點是人們想看到這個
Anyway, the point is people want to see that.

872
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,482
你不是故意搞我吧？
You're really not messing with me?

873
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:10,919
我沒搞你 觀眾會喜歡這個的！
I am not messing with you. They're going to love it.

874
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,920
- 酷 - 但是...
- Cool. - But...

875
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:19,054
- 什么？- 你也要幫我
- What? - I won't do it unless you help me.

876
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,331
你要我一起跳 我不跳 你就不跳？
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

877
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:25,027
不是 是教拳擊
No. Boxing.

878
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:26,634
- 噢 我懂了！ - 我來編程序
- Oh, I see. - I program the robot.

879
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,900
- 你來教他拳擊 - 然后你跳舞
- You teach him to box. - And you dance.

880
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:30,498
然后你來跳舞！
And you dance.

881
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:33,905
- 好嗎？- 好！
- Yeah. - Yeah?

882
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,037
一言為定
Deal.

883
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,374
一言為定
Deal.

884
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,817
那樣會很酷的
It's going to be cool.

885
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:39,074
很好
Nice.

886
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:43,813
你的對手都是比較高的 所以你要打高一點！
You're going to be punching guys bigger. You're going to have to punch up.

887
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,708
對了 就是這樣！
That's it.

888
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:47,809
很好！
Nice.

889
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:54,857
你也是老骨頭一把了？
You, too, old man?

890
01:11:55,928 --> 01:11:57,862
來吧！讓我們好好鍛煉！
Come on. Let's get to work.

891
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:02,725
很好 再做一次
Nice! Let's do that again.

892
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:06,596
很好！三連擊組合！
Nice. Three-punch combo.

893
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:08,997
組合拳！
Combo.

894
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,809
再一次 再一次！
Again. Again.

895
01:12:12,845 --> 01:12:16,440
快一點 再快一點 很好！
Faster. Faster. Nice.

896

你甚至不用調呼吸 很好 我喜歡！
You're not even out of breath. I like it.

897
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,116
讓我們看看你的動作！
Let's see how you move.

898
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:30,152

退后幾步！ 左勾拳 左勾拳！
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

900
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,951
就是這樣 每次都是
That's it. Every time.

901
01:13:35,928 --> 01:13:37,520
上勾拳
Upper cut!

902
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:46,300

第二個扣應 你有什么要分享的？
Caller two, what do you got for me?

905
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,979
你有沒有聽過一個小個頭的機器人 叫做Atom的？
Have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?

906
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:03,111
噢 是的
Oh, yeah.

907
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:05,850
我們一群朋友昨天晚上有看到 他會跳舞
My buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.

908
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,926
- 你是說 "舞蹈"？- 是的 就是舞蹈
- Did you say "dances"? - You heard me.

909
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,153
他在比賽前都會跟個小男孩一起表演舞蹈
He dances pre-fight with this little kid,

910
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:11,820
觀眾都看瘋了 樂瘋了！
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

911
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,763
先不討論哪些花招小玩意
You put the gimmick aside for a second,

912
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,335
我手里有份他打敗的人的名單

Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack. No slouches on that list, right?

914
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,072
Atom把它們統統打敗了
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

915
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:28,306
Atom很快 他躲過這些大家伙的絕招 不可思議是吧！
This bot is fast! He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!

916
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:31,606
不用懷疑 聽眾們一定會記得這個名字
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners, remember this name:

917
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:36,586
Atom 沒錯 A-T-O-M 這個機器人值得一看
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M. This bot is one to watch.

923
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,631
好的 那是WRB...這不是職業比賽？
Right. That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

924
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,802
沒錯 你怎么說 老弟 你準備好了嗎？
Damn right it is. What do you say, fellas? You ready for the show?

925
01:15:01,346 --> 01:15:02,813
當然 耶
Heck, yeah.

926
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:14,315
這是不計名次的 但是還是職業級的
It's the undercard, but it's still a League fight.

927
01:15:15,294 --> 01:15:18,320
我要你放松一點 平常心
I just want you to be relaxed. I want you to be relaxed.

928
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,326
不要祛場 不要給我那個疑惑的表情
No freaking out. Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

929
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:23,828
如果你疑惑了 你會被修理的很慘
You go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.

930
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,804
不管怎么樣 享受比賽 享受樂趣 不要緊張
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun. You got to have fun, you understand me?

931
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:31,933
我們來到這里已經很不容易的 祛場會搞砸一切的
We've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.

932
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,343
一切會很有趣的 千萬不要祛場！
We're going to have fun, and we're going to not freak out!

933
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:38,980
我們好好地放松心情 好好的修理對手一頓
We're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.

934
01:15:39,084 --> 01:15:42,349
這是我一輩子的夢想 我們將要參加...
I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...

935
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:47,019
告訴你 相信我 千萬不要祛場 聽到了嗎？
I tell you what. Trust me when I say no freaking out. You got it?

936
01:15:47,926 --> 01:15:49,951
- 聽到了 - 很好
- I got it. - Good.

937

當然 讓我們一起到拳王的貴賓室
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up to the champ's suite. Sure.

941
01:16:33,271 --> 01:16:34,363
哇
Wow.

942
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:38,473
- 先生們 我是法羅 蘭蔻娃 - 你好 我是Charlie肯頓 這是...
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova. - Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

943
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:40,768
當然還有松本先生
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

944
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:43,143
老天爺！是松本先生
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

945
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:47,380
我知道你們今晚有一場重要的比賽 所以我就直接了當說了
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.

946
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,122
那個動作我喜歡 很漂亮的動作 所以... (Charlie已經語無倫次了）
It's a little far from the action for my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

947
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:55,159
漂亮的相片... 哇！非常漂亮
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

948
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,421
看看這個 你要個簽名嗎？你介意嗎？
Look at that. You want an autograph? Would you mind?

949
01:16:57,729 --> 01:16:59,458
我想買你們的機器人
I'd like to buy your robot.

950
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,100
他對我們是一個很好的前場表演機器人 所以我愿意付你們
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus. And for that I'm willing to pay.

951
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:10,233
二十萬
$200,000.

952
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:11,900
- 沒問題 - 我不要賣
- Done. - He's not for sale.

953
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:14,740
- 當然要 我們絕對可以... - Atom是不賣的
- Of course he is. We can definitely... - He's not for sale.

954
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:20,341
你們還有十五分鐘要對上雙子星
You are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities,

955
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:22,386
一個邪惡的職業機器人
a vicious League bot.

956
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:27,925
所以我的報價在鈴聲前才有效
So, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.

957
01:17:28,026 --> 01:17:32,190
好的 但是讓我再說一遍 不賣！
OK. And just to be clear, he's not for sale!

958
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:34,424
現在不賣 以后也不賣
Not now, not ever.

959
01:17:35,767 --> 01:17:37,928
給我一分鐘想清楚 好嗎！
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

960
01:17:38,437 --> 01:17:40,928
松本 你好嗎？Max！！慢一點！
Tak, how are you? Max!

961
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,366
聰明一點 我知道你很喜歡他
Be smart. I know you love him,

962
01:17:45,477 --> 01:17:48,071
但是過二十分鐘 它可能就毀了
but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.

963
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,274
- 考慮一下 接受吧！ - 你動動頭腦想一下
- Think about it. Take the offer. - You think about it.

964
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:55,509
他們為什么要賣Atom？因為他是與眾不同的
Why does she want Atom? Because he's different from other bots!

965
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,789
是啊 是不一樣 是小個 虛弱的
Yeah, he's different. He's smaller, weaker,

966
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:00,016
- 而且他會被揍的很慘的 - 他是拳擊手
- and he's going to get his ass kicked. - He's a boxer.

967
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:02,422
我們叫他拳擊 你教他拳擊
We taught him to box. You taught him to box!

968
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,129
- 這個就是它的價值 - 我也是這么認為
- That's worth something. - I think it is, too.

969
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:08,893
我想這個值20萬 20萬大元
I think it's worth 200 grand. Two hundred grand.

970
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,969
我們可以整晚都在這里兜
We can go round and round this all night long.

971
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,367
看著我
Look at me.

972
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,070
但是絕對不會賣的
But it's not going to happen.

973
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:18,506
對不起我還有比賽
I got a fight to get to.

974
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:37,060
各位先生女士們 今晚...
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

975
01:18:37,162 --> 01:18:41,929
即將帶來的 鋼鐵擂臺冠軍杯
the march towards the Real Steel Championship

976
01:18:42,033 --> 01:18:45,093
來到了底特律
makes its way through Detroit's

977
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:49,264
維吉尼亞州 史倍狀中心
Virgin America Spectrum!

978
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:57,579
開始我們的第一輪排名賽
Kicking off the evening, in our first undercard,

979
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:00,613
二個頭的暴君
the two-headed tyrant,

980
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:05,151
雙子星
Twin Cities!

981
01:19:35,554 --> 01:19:40,890
對手是第一次參加職業比賽的
Opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight,

982
01:19:40,992 --> 01:19:44,450
讓我們一起喊
hailing from parts unknown,

983
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:46,326
Atom
Atom!

984
01:20:42,053 --> 01:20:43,452
- 跳得好 老板 - 謝謝
- Nice work, boss. - Thanks.

985
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:45,420
- 你切換到戰斗模式了？- 當然
- Did you switch him to fight mode? - Of course.

986
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:48,287
- 雙子星是訓練來撕裂對手 - Atom 也可以
- This bot is tough to put down. - Atom can do it.

987
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,287
看看那里 那二個握著搖桿在熒幕后面的怪胎
Look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

988
01:20:52,397 --> 01:20:54,194
他們完全控制他們的機器人
They're controlling everything their bot does.

989
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:55,459
他們隨時監看它的系統
They're monitoring his systems,

990
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,161
隨時調整他的戰術
seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights.

991
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,329
這個不是以前我們對戰的地下那種用遙控器的級別
This is not like the underground handheld remote bots

992
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,338
這是職業賽 你要了解到
we've been fighting. This is the League. Stand on that.

993
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,408
那我們要怎么做？
So what do we do?

994
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:08,668
我們要聰明一點 有耐心 然后祈禱
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

995
01:21:10,248 --> 01:21:12,045
正經一點 不是那種祈禱
Seriously, pray.

996
01:21:14,519 --> 01:21:15,543
準備好！
Ready!

997

閃左邊！ 閃右邊！防守好！
Lean left! Lean right! Cover up! Cover up!

1004
01:21:52,257 --> 01:21:55,192

- What's going on in there? - He's taking too many hits.

1005
01:22:01,099 --> 01:22:02,327
把手舉起來
Get your hands up!

1006
01:22:05,203 --> 01:22:07,068
離開角落！ 移動！
Get out of that corner! Move!

1007
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:12,474
他在被狠狠修理了 趕快告訴他怎么做！
He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!

1008
01:22:12,577 --> 01:22:15,410
對手有二個頭 二個頭都對著我們 而且沒有盲點
That guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1009
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,378
對手一定有弱點 找出來吧！
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1010
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,583
看到了 等一下 看到了！
Wait, wait, wait.

1011
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:28,224
右手肩膀 右手肩膀 他有一個習慣動作
Right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1012
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:30,760
每次出右拳的時候 他都有一個準備動作
He's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb!

1013
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:33,223
抓到了 看到沒？又有準備動作了
We got him! See? Here it comes again!

1014

1016
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:41,529
來吧 Charlie 跟上去！
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

1017
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:44,233
我們要縮近到對我們有利的距離
Got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!

1018
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:47,505
攻擊左邊身體 右邊身體 再左邊身體
Left to the body! Right to the body! Left to the body!

1019
01:22:47,612 --> 01:22:49,102

- These program modes aren't working. - Left! Right hook, slip!

1022
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,183
右上鉤拳！ 左上鉤全！躲左邊 閃右邊
Right uppercut! Left uppercut! Duck left. Counter right!

1023
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:01,850

盯住他 ！ 前后分身 ！

Don't let him go. Right to the body! Straight right to the head!

1048
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,220
我們從垃圾場來的的小巨人 擊倒了職業級的機器人
Our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.

1049
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,622
爽不爽？
How about that?

1050
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:47,491
最后我要對一個背地里操作的女孩說...
And the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,

1051
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,499
法羅 蘭蔻娃
Farra Lemkova.

1052
01:24:53,805 --> 01:24:57,571
她想買我的機器人 用你們的錢來操作比賽
That instead of buying my robot, using your money to control this sport...

1053
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,506
- 就是她 - 不是我說的
- That's it! - I'm not done.

1054
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,239
你為什么不給小巨人一個最大的機會？
Why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?

1055
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:06,649
因為我敢打賭 你不敢給我們這個機會
Because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!

1056
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:08,343
大家想不想看小巨人
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1057
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:10,478
對抗聯盟冠軍

1058
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:17,928
我要挑戰宙斯！
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

1059
01:25:19,964 --> 01:25:23,957
任何時間 任何地點！
Any time, any place, anywhere!

1060

告訴我們 ！ 我們就來！
You name it! We will be there!

1061

我來為各位安排這場比賽
I'm going to get us that fight!

1062
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:43,811
Atom Atom Atom...
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1063
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:58,965
那是很沒腦的舉動 你就這樣挑戰宙斯？
That was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.

1064
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:00,635
那只是一時的沖動
That's one thing to call it.

1065
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:02,000
很多人會很想看的
A lot of people would like to see that.

1066

- 對對對 - 很好笑！
- That's so right. - That's very funny.

1071
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,380
- 我就說我們不應該賣掉它 - 喔 喔 喔！
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him. - OK. No, no, no.

1072
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:22,653
我想起來了 誰才對？說啊 說出來“Max是對的”？
I remember now. Who's right? Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1073
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,728
好啦好啦 你才是對的！
All right, all right. All right.

1074
01:26:24,829 --> 01:26:28,424
- 我們合作無間是吧 - 不是不是 要說“Max是對的”
- We're a good team. - No, no. Max is right.

1075
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,964
不敢相信 這么多錢 感謝你 雙子星！
That was unbelievable. Thank you, Twin Cities.

1076
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,871

1077
01:26:34,973 --> 01:26:37,339
- 我們去慶祝了！ - Charlie男孩
- Let's do it. - Charlie boy.

1078
01:26:38,309 --> 01:26:41,608
- 里奇 我才正想要打給你 - 噢？是嗎？
- Ricky, I was just going to call you. - Oh, yeah.

I actually really was going to call you.

1080
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,513
沒事 不用在意
Don't worry about that.

1081
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,643
真的是了不起的比賽！

It was an amazing fight. That was a great job, young man.

1084
01:26:54,993 --> 01:26:56,483
- 來吧！兄弟 - 干嘛？
- Come on, man. - What?

1085
01:26:56,594 --> 01:27:00,724
- 你不會是說真的吧？- 你以為我在開玩笑？
- You serious? - You thought I was joking

1086
01:27:00,832 --> 01:27:02,629
我說“見你一次就海扁你一次”
when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?

1087
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:05,828
你以為我是開玩笑？告訴你 絕對不是！
He thought that was a joke. It wasn't a joke.

1088

I got a kid here. And I have your money. We don't have a problem.

1089

我看你也不敢
I'm sure you do,

1090
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:16,070
但是不只是因為錢是吧？你都知道的
but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?

1091
01:27:16,381 --> 01:27:21,546
好的 你要多少？二萬 二萬五 三萬夠不夠？
All right. What do you want? You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1092
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,416
- 我手頭上有現金 - 是哦！對啊
- I got the money in cash here. - Yeah, right.

1093
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:26,649
趕快跑！Max 跑 快跑！
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

1098
01:27:43,908 --> 01:27:45,000
嗨 里奇！
Hey, Ricky.

1099
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:46,770
那是他的錢 跟他無關
That's his money! Leave him out of this!

1100
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,081
停
Stop!

1101
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:04,856

1102
01:28:04,962 --> 01:28:08,591
把所有的錢都拿走 全拿走！
Take all his money. Take it all.

1103
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:13,662
小朋友 你的朋友是個人渣
Your friend's a real dirt bag, kid.

1104
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:15,432
他是我父親
He's my father!

1105
01:28:17,575 --> 01:28:22,410
看來可以少扁你一次了
Well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.

1106
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:25,175
嗯 好好的給你上一課
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1107
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:33,757
就像以前一樣 Charlie男孩
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1108
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:35,120
走吧 兄弟們
Let's go, boys.

1109
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:05,182
對不起 Max 我很抱歉
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1110
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,661
- 我們來這里做什么？- Max 只是...
- What are we doing here? - Max, just...

1111
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:50,859
來找法羅？她是不是打給你了？我們要跟宙斯比賽了？
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she? We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1112
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:55,132
不是宙斯 我想了很多 然后......
It's not the Zeus people. I've been thinking about all this, and...

1113
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:58,267
Max
Max!

1114
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,816
很高興見到你
It's so good to see you.

1115
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:12,515
- 為什么她在這里？- 你最好還是現在跟她回去
- What is she doing here? - It's better if you go with her now.

1116
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:14,682
我們被痛扁了 所以你打電話給她來接我？
We get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?

1117
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,692
他被打了 我就說他沒法照顧好Max的！
He's been beat up. I told you he couldn't take care of him!

1118
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:19,592
是的 我打給他們 你看我們 真是一團糟
Yeah. I called her. Look at us. We're a mess.

1119
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:21,722
我們很好 叫他們走
We're fine. She can leave!

1120
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,859
Atom打得很好 我們可以把錢再賺回來
Atom's fighting good. We can make the money back.

1121
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,570
Charlie 拜托！
Charlie, please.

1122
01:30:28,606 --> 01:30:29,698
只是...
Just...

1123
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,078
Charlie 我們過得很好
Charlie, we're doing so good.

1124
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:38,982
Charlie 拜托 不要
Charlie, please, no.

1125
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:42,913
不要 不要 不要
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1126
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:46,856
拜托 拜托
Please. Please.

1127
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,623
相信我 這樣對你比較好 好嗎？
Trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?

1128
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:58,133
你以為這樣對我比較好 其實不是的
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.

1129
01:30:58,236 --> 01:30:59,897
你還年輕 你不懂
You're too young. You don't know.

1130
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:01,665
看著我 相信我！
Look at me, trust me.

1131
01:31:01,772 --> 01:31:05,003
而且法律上 她有你的監護權 我還能怎么做？
And legally she has custody, so what can I do?

1132
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:07,808
我還能做什么？
What can I do?

1133
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,755
我不要你的錢 馬文
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1134
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:27,956
Max 我們有自己的游泳池哦
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1135
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:32,764
而且我們有按摩浴缸 還有很多好玩的玩具給你玩
and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.

1136
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,634
你要玩玩嘛？很好玩的哦
Do you want to play with them? It's going to be fun.

1137
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:37,830
情況如何？
What's going on?

1138
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:40,706
謝謝你 他根本不跟我講話
He won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.

1139
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,179
我先到車子里面等
I'm going to wait in the car.

1140
01:31:45,883 --> 01:31:48,351
你不想講話？好 我說
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1141
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:50,621
你要我說什么？我很抱歉？
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1142
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:53,781
從一開始就是這樣
You knew from day one what this was.

1143
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:55,756
從你開始決定上車就是這樣
You decided to take the ride.

1144
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:00,128
你以為我可以跟你那個破爛堆撿到...
You thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap

1145
01:32:00,298 --> 01:32:02,789
的破機器人一起坐著看夕陽？
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1146
01:32:04,835 --> 01:32:07,235
你看錯我了
No, you forgot who I was!

1147
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:14,801
你應該過的好一點的生活...
You deserve better...

1148
01:32:16,213 --> 01:32:17,305
...比我還好
than me.

1149
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:23,683
拜托說幾句話吧？
Will you say something, please?

1150
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,222
我努力過了 你還要我怎么做？
I tried. What do you want from me?

1151
01:32:26,324 --> 01:32:28,087
我要你為我奮斗
I want you to fight for me.

1152
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:31,158
這就是我想要的
That's all I ever wanted.

1153
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:35,408
翻譯：閑閑的猛男 校對：目前沒有

1154
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,810
不要問
Don't ask.

1155
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:41,357
Max走了？
So no Max.

1156
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,355
最好的安排 馬文及黛博拉他們有錢 會好好照顧Max
It's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1157
01:34:46,464 --> 01:34:48,295
你有沒有看到他看你的樣子？
Did you not see the way he looked at you?

1158
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:51,799
就像我看我爹的樣子
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1159
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,097
我多想再重溫那種感覺
Even now I would give anything to have that back.

1160
01:34:54,205 --> 01:34:58,266
你父親不一樣 他從一開始就跟你在一起
Your dad was special. He was in your corner from day one.

1161
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:01,040
我 我早就搞砸了
Me, come on. I blew it.

1162
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,312
我搞砸了
I blew it.

1163
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,150
當Max出生的時候...
When Max was born I just...

1164
01:35:07,852 --> 01:35:09,251
...我嚇傻了
freaked out.

1165
01:35:09,353 --> 01:35:11,548
你沒有感到滿足嗎？
But something would have been better than nothing.

1166
01:35:11,856 --> 01:35:13,118
不對 是手足無措
I wouldn't know where to start.

1167
01:35:13,224 --> 01:35:14,248
- 我不滿足 - 不 你很幸福
- Yeah, you do. - I don't.

1168
01:35:14,358 --> 01:35:15,985
- 你是的 - 不是
- You do. - No.

1169
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,053
你是的
You do.

1170
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,087
我要走了
I got to go.

1171
01:35:55,132 --> 01:35:56,599
開了1200英里就為了這個吻？
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1172
01:35:58,202 --> 01:36:00,602
值得 值得！
Worth it. Worth it.

1173
01:36:12,049 --> 01:36:13,539
去找他 Charlie！
Go get him, Charlie.

1174
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,386
你說得好像你爹的口氣
You sound like your dad.

1175
01:36:46,617 --> 01:36:50,451
我知道你認為我遺棄了你
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1176
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:53,421
而且我還真的這樣做了
and I guess I did originally.

1177
01:36:53,524 --> 01:36:54,548
你還賣掉我
Then you sold me.

1178
01:36:55,259 --> 01:36:56,385
Charlie？
Charlie.

1179
01:36:57,461 --> 01:36:59,429
這個地方一點都不歡迎你
You have no business being here.

1180
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,090
沒錯 你有全部的監護權 他是你的
That's true. You've got full custody. He's yours.

1181
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:06,135
而且我知道所有的事都是我的錯 但是請你讓我...
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1182
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,230
...我想要做一些補償
I'd just like to do one thing right.

1183
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,268
好的
Right.

1184
01:37:15,946 --> 01:37:17,573
- 講到哪里了？- 你賣掉我
- Where were we? - You sold me.

1185
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:19,979
哦 對了 耶 沒錯
Right, yeah, that happened.

1186
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,279
- 等一下 什么？- 然后我們被痛扁一頓
- Wait, what? - Then we had our asses kicked.

1187
01:37:22,386 --> 01:37:24,547
然后你還要睡在一個破卡車里面
And you slept on a shelf in a truck, and it was awful.

1188
01:37:24,655 --> 01:37:26,384
- 很危險 - 非常危險
- And dangerous. - Really dangerous.

1189
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:30,358
我知道 天啊 我真的很對不起你
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1190
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:34,420
你來就是要說這個？就是要說你很抱歉？
That's why you came? To say you're sorry?

1191
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:37,022
不 不止這些
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1192
01:37:40,037 --> 01:37:43,598
我來還要再說 我了解了
But no. No, I came to tell you that I heard you.

1193
01:37:44,575 --> 01:37:48,067
我懂了 雖然我有一點遲鈍 但是我懂了
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1194
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:53,108
我知道我去流浪了 當你出生的時候
I know you had a bum ride, and I wasn't there and I should have been.

1195
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:55,409
我實在不應該去的
I should have been.

1196
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,144
你媽媽真的是...
Your mom was...

1197
01:37:58,656 --> 01:38:00,521
她很好是吧 很酷吧？
She was cool, wasn't she?

1198
01:38:02,092 --> 01:38:03,150
是的
She was.

1199
01:38:04,028 --> 01:38:05,325
她是最好的
She was the coolest.

1200
01:38:06,163 --> 01:38:08,688
耶 是的
Yeah, she was.

1201
01:38:11,568 --> 01:38:16,562
對她的事 我也很遺憾
And I'm sorry about... what happened with her.

1202
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,605
馬克思 我沒法讓時間倒流
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1203
01:38:22,713 --> 01:38:26,012
但是現在我來了...
but I'm here right now...

1204
01:38:27,384 --> 01:38:30,649
...就像你看到的 我已經準備好要為你戰斗
and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.

1205
01:38:44,601 --> 01:38:46,330
跟宙斯的比賽安排好了
We got the Zeus fight.

1206
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:47,597
真的？
What?

1207
01:38:47,705 --> 01:38:49,605
沒錯 安排好了
No, no, we didn't.

1208
01:38:50,507 --> 01:38:52,532
準備跟宙斯戰斗
You got the Zeus fight.

1209
01:38:56,447 --> 01:38:58,381
黛博拉 可以請你通融嗎？
So what do you say, Debra?

1210
01:38:58,482 --> 01:39:00,040
可不可以讓我們在一起奮戰 最后一次？
Can we do this one last thing?

1211
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,048
- 就一晚 - 我們就這個小小要求
- One night. - It's all we need. Thank you.

1212
01:39:11,095 --> 01:39:14,724
我們很可能被痛宰 但是至少我們在一起奮斗
We'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.

1213
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:17,726
耶？你怎么決定？
Yeah? What do you say?

1214
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:24,371
歡迎來到紐約的濱中心及觀看鋼鐵擂臺冠軍大賽
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1215
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:26,773
提姆 這是場我們不敢想象會安排的比賽
Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.

1216
01:39:27,077 --> 01:39:29,272
宙斯 永遠不敗的WRB拳王
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

1217
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,645
迎戰最近新崛起的初級的Atom
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1218
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,650
拳王的老板答應了這場比賽
The champ's handlers have agreed to fight

1219
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:37,414
打破了聯盟循環賽的規則
outside the circle of well-known League bots,

1220
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:41,651
而且準備給觀眾一場真正的重量級的對抗
and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1221
01:39:41,759 --> 01:39:45,286
提姆 告訴我 拳王是不是腦袋進水了？
Now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1222
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,159
有史以來最偉大的機器人格斗拳王
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1223
01:39:47,264 --> 01:39:50,256
為了跟一個第二代的 Atom 戰斗而交出他的腰帶？
gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?

1224
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:54,303
赫伯 如果你問松本先生 宙斯團隊是不是瘋了
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1225
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,669
他可能會用一貫冷酷的表情回你
Now, he may look cool as he enters the arena,

1226
01:39:56,774 --> 01:39:59,800
然后用輕蔑的表情看待這場比賽
but he has made no bones about his disdain for this match up.

1227
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:02,738
前幾天我們的攝影機試著要補抓這號表情
Our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.

1228
01:40:02,846 --> 01:40:05,838
看看這個片段 松本先生甚至根本不想停下來跟媒體講話
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

1229
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:09,313
好像這場比賽是是侮辱了他偉大的創造物
referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.

1230
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:13,288
Charlie Atom的教練做的已經不只是跳級挑戰宙斯
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.

1231
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,618
還是公開的挑戰
He did so publicly.

1232
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:18,422
這個挑戰對拳王的公關形象是一個大挑戰
The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1233
01:40:18,529 --> 01:40:22,192
沒有任何合約 但是我相信拳王的團隊很清楚他們在做什么
No argument there. And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1234
01:40:22,299 --> 01:40:23,732
那就是他們做的 來吧
That they do. Come on.

1235
01:40:23,834 --> 01:40:26,860
給一個無名小卒一個機會來挑戰
Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.

1236
01:40:27,171 --> 01:40:30,265
那個垃圾廠的挑戰者？這一切都只是噱頭罷了
This "junkyard dog," if you will. That's a marketing stunt.

1237
01:40:30,374 --> 01:40:33,172
而且從觀眾的反應看起來 很奏效！
And judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.

1238
01:40:47,424 --> 01:40:48,789
我們贏不了 是吧？
We can't win, can we?

1239
01:40:49,827 --> 01:40:50,919
很難說
We'll see.

1240
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,494
挑戰者正慢慢的走到他的角落
As the challenger makes his way into the arena,

1241
01:40:57,601 --> 01:40:59,796
你可以感受到激情的洶涌
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1242
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,614
Atom已經抵達WRB的比賽現場
Atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1243
01:41:14,718 --> 01:41:17,516
用他“像人類”的外觀
using a style, some would call it human-like,

1244
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:20,215
他戰斗的模式是非常少見的
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1245
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:22,519
Atom 跟他的迷你訓練員已經踏上比賽場地
Atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring

1246
01:41:22,626 --> 01:41:25,493
看看法羅的表情 說明了一切
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1247
01:41:25,596 --> 01:41:27,757
歡迎來到大聯盟 年輕人
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1248
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:30,698
現在的賭盤開出來是1賠5 賭Atom撐不過第一回合
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.

1249
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:32,291
有人要賭嗎？
Who wants some?

1250
01:41:32,936 --> 01:41:34,631
現在可以開始下注了
I'll take some of that action.

1251
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:37,901
嗨 我要下注
Hey, there! I'll take some of that action.

1252
01:41:39,243 --> 01:41:42,303
最近如何... 伙伴？
How's it going... partner?

1253
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:43,777
誰是你的伙伴？
Partner?

1254
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:47,511
很好 我下十萬 怎么樣？刺不刺激？
That's great. How about a hundred K? Is that funny?

1255
01:41:47,618 --> 01:41:50,280
十萬？賭Atom 撐不過第一回合？
Hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.

1256
01:41:50,387 --> 01:41:52,218
你有帶那么多現金？
You carrying around that kind of scratch?

1257
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,720
- 耶 - 十萬？
- Yeah. - Hundred K?

1258
01:41:56,426 --> 01:42:00,658
記得 我在101區 C 排
Tell you what. Remember section 101, row C,

1259
01:42:00,764 --> 01:42:03,460
然后把我的錢拿過來
and you can bring me my money right to my seat.

1260
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:06,934
101 C排 ？十萬 ？
101, row C? Hundred K?

1261
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:08,966
你聽到的 “宅男”！
You heard me, homey.

1262
01:42:09,273 --> 01:42:10,934
-宅男 ？- 是的 ？
- Homey? - Right?

1263
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:12,401
宅在家里的大男孩
Homeboy!

1264
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:15,909
沒事 保鏢們 酷！
All right. Peace out, posse.

1265
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:17,510
來吧甜心 我們走吧
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1266
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:43,933
- 永遠不敗的 - 表演時間
- Never beaten. - It's showtime!

1267
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:46,334
永不恐懼的
Never threatened.

1268
01:42:46,443 --> 01:42:49,606
拳擊場上的王者
The king of the ring,

1269
01:42:49,713 --> 01:42:51,840
機器人的統治者
the ruler of robots!

1270
01:42:53,016 --> 01:42:58,352
歡迎我們王者宙斯！
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1271
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:25,005
哦！shit ！
Oh, shit!

1272
01:43:31,588 --> 01:43:32,885
好屌！
That was awesome.

1273
01:43:39,563 --> 01:43:40,723
來吧 我們走
Come on, let's go.

1274
01:43:47,504 --> 01:43:50,064
各位先生女士們
Ladies and gentlemen,

1275
01:43:50,374 --> 01:43:52,899
在五回合的拳擊規則下
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1276
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:56,446
進行世界拳擊冠軍大賽

1282
01:44:15,732 --> 01:44:19,964

1283
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:28,739
現在 各位先生女士們準備好

1286
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:42,048
鈴聲響起 馬上開始比賽了
There's the starting bell and we are underway.

1287

機器人慢慢的離開他們的角落

1288
01:44:44,995 --> 01:44:48,055
宙斯一下就把Atom打趴 Atom已經倒下了
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1289
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,491
站起來！
On your feet!

1290
01:44:49,599 --> 01:44:52,067
看來又是一出宙斯式的慘劇
Looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.

1291
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:56,938
裁判馬特蓋格已經出來開始倒數了
Referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.

1292
01:44:58,008 --> 01:44:59,066

1293
01:45:00,744 --> 01:45:02,905
用手撐起來！站起來！

1294
01:45:03,947 --> 01:45:06,541

1295
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:09,118
準備迎接宙斯的第二輪猛攻
to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!

1296
01:45:09,419 --> 01:45:12,411
不到十秒時間 Atom又一次倒下了

1304
01:45:35,178 --> 01:45:37,544
- 離開角落！ - 移動！
- Get out of there! - Move!

1305
01:45:39,816 --> 01:45:41,875
一陣摧毀式的近身攻擊
A demolishing inside shot.

1306
01:45:41,985 --> 01:45:43,111
把手舉起來！
Get your hands up!

1307
01:45:45,122 --> 01:45:46,680
舉起來！
Hands up!

1308
01:45:47,624 --> 01:45:49,057

Kenton desperately trying to command his robot out of that suicide corner.

1311
01:45:59,002 --> 01:46:00,060

Get your feet under you!

1312
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:03,797
晚安 表演機器人！
Good night, sparring bot!

1313
01:46:03,907 --> 01:46:06,637
今晚只是時間長了一點 但是宙斯又一次要擊倒了...
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!

1314
01:46:06,743 --> 01:46:10,076
Atom第三次倒下了 也可能是今晚最后一次倒下
Atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.

1315
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,546
- 站起來！ - 2！
- Stand up! - Two!

1316
01:46:12,649 --> 01:46:14,048
3！
Three!

1317
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:15,516
Atom 站起來！
Atom, get up!

1318
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,678

1321
01:46:24,094 --> 01:46:28,622
真不敢相信！似曾相識 小巨人又一次站了起來
I don't believe this! Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.

1322
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,892
來吧 Atom！
Come on, Atom!

1323
01:46:34,037 --> 01:46:35,197
它撐不下去的
He can't survive this!

1324
01:46:39,009 --> 01:46:41,204
- 來吧 Charlie！ - 右上勾拳
- Come on, Charlie! - Right uppercut!

1325
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,240
Atom 使出一記絕招！
Atom has landed a punch!

1326
01:46:45,549 --> 01:46:50,577
宙斯被出乎意料的上鉤拳擊中 搖晃的退后
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1327
01:46:50,687 --> 01:46:52,120
前進！
Advance!

1328
01:46:52,222 --> 01:46:53,712
退一步 出右拳！
Fade back, counter right!

1329
01:46:54,524 --> 01:46:55,684
退一步 出右拳！
Fade back, counter right!

1330
01:46:56,526 --> 01:47:00,963
右交叉拳！ 右交叉拳！ 右交叉拳！ 左勾拳！
Right cross! Right cross! Right cross! Left hook!

1331
01:47:01,064 --> 01:47:03,931
- 來吧！ 上吧！ - 擊倒他！
- Let's go! Come on! - Take him down!

1332
01:47:04,601 --> 01:47:06,660
第一次 Atom占了優勢
For the first time in his dominant run,

1333
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:10,638
宙斯第一次遇到一個打不退的對手
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!

1334
01:47:12,275 --> 01:47:15,108
群眾已經瘋狂了 宙斯使出渾身解數
The crowd is going nuts! Zeus gives it everything he's got

1335
01:47:15,212 --> 01:47:18,181
第一回合已經剩下15秒鐘了
as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!

1336
01:47:18,281 --> 01:47:22,240
宙斯把Atom逼到角落 使出雙組合拳
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!

1337
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:25,544
上擊 下擊！好像鐘擺上上下下
Downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!

1338
01:47:25,655 --> 01:47:28,715
- 手舉起來 下巴壓低 - 蹲低一點 蹲低一點
- Hands up, chin down. - Stay low, stay low!

1339
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:37,292
只剩5秒鐘 拳王使出了活塞式的組合拳
Only five seconds left, as here comes that piston-packed right of the champ!

1340
01:47:38,835 --> 01:47:42,999
鈴聲響起了 不敢相信 Atom竟然撐過了第一回合
There's the bell! I don't believe it. Somehow Atom has survived.

1341
01:47:43,106 --> 01:47:48,169
竟然進到了第二回合 觀眾都起雞皮疙瘩了
We will have a second round. And the crowd here is thrilled!

1342
01:47:51,281 --> 01:47:54,614
他辦到了！ 耶！ 回來角落！
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1343
01:47:56,086 --> 01:47:59,920
我們要趕快離開這里 馬上！
We got to get out of here. We got to get out of here now!

1344
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:05,024
走另外一邊 快點！
We got to go this way. Come on!

1345
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,897
好吧 你坐下吧！
OK, you sit down.

1346
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:17,767
- 走吧 宅男 - 好啦
- Let's go, homey. - All right.

1347
01:48:17,874 --> 01:48:19,307
我一會就回來 寶貝
I'll be back for you, baby.

1348
01:48:20,277 --> 01:48:22,609
把你的手拿開 我自己走
Get your hands off me!

1349
01:48:25,015 --> 01:48:27,950
二個角落都在忙的檢查他們的機器人
Both corners furiously working on their bots.

1350
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:31,384
觀眾們本來都預期今晚是個大屠殺
This crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre,

1351
01:48:31,688 --> 01:48:33,679
但是迎來的是一場勢均力敵的戰斗
but instead they're getting a war!

1352
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:35,121
- 你弄好了嗎？- 耶
- You got it? - Yeah.

1353
01:48:35,225 --> 01:48:36,249
好樣的 來吧！繼續！
All right. Here we go.

1354
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:38,657
怎么搞的？
What is happening?

1355
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:43,756
他已經完全準備好應付任何突發狀況 沒有事的
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.

1356
01:48:43,867 --> 01:48:45,164
然后呢？
What next?

1357
01:48:46,036 --> 01:48:47,333
第二回合
Round two.

1358
01:48:55,645 --> 01:48:58,944
Atom 第二回合 Atom 不可思議的挑戰者
Round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1359
01:48:59,049 --> 01:49:01,074
勇敢的挑戰拳王
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1360
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:06,414
宙斯揣著小巨人 把它像個罐子丟到繩邊
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!

1361
01:49:10,193 --> 01:49:15,187
肯頓讓他的機器人打出一個三連擊 打在拳王的臉上！
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1362
01:49:20,236 --> 01:49:24,229
他們并列在戰場 震耳欲聾的歡呼聲
Toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!

1363
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:31,076
不管繩圈旁的教練想什么伎倆都沒有用了
Whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!

1364
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:37,250
金屬對戰金屬 鋼鐵大戰鋼鐵
Metal bashing metal. Steel smashing steel.

1365
01:49:37,354 --> 01:49:39,754
這是一場大戰
This is a brawl!

1366
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:47,262
觀眾已經都站起來了 拉長脖子看二個機器人殘殺對方
The crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!

1367
01:49:47,364 --> 01:49:50,060
也即將要發生什么大事了
Something has to give, and it does!

1368
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:51,997
Atom 又一次倒下了
Atom goes down again!

1369
01:49:52,102 --> 01:49:56,232
今晚再一次次的點亮惡斗的戰場
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!

1370
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:01,003
又一次 Atom又站起來了
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1371
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:05,707
肯頓逼不得已要跳線接上 才可以使機器人回到比賽
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!

1372
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:17,050
第四回合中段 拳王想馬上擊倒對手 結束比賽
Midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.

1373
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,494
拳王已經豁出一切 好像不打算回到更衣室了
The champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1374
01:50:31,775 --> 01:50:35,472
Atom在繩索邊搖搖晃晃 他已經昏了！
Atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!

1375
01:50:35,779 --> 01:50:37,178
- 手舉起來！ - 出了什么事？
- Hands up! - What's going on?

1376
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,215
我猜語音控制已經壞掉了 沒有反應！
I think the voice recog is shot! He's not responding!

1377
01:50:43,453 --> 01:50:48,220
宙斯就像完美的暴力武器 鉆進Atom的腹部
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1378
01:50:48,324 --> 01:50:51,521
不！住手！幫一下手啊！
No! Stop! Do something!

1379
01:50:51,828 --> 01:50:52,852
他已經聽不到了！
He can't hear me!

1380
01:50:54,197 --> 01:50:59,829
但是鈴聲又響起了 小機器人的表現已經震驚了整個世界
But the bell sounds, and once again this little robot has stunned the world!

1381
01:51:01,938 --> 01:51:06,341
我們完蛋了 Max 他聽不到我的語音指揮了 這是謀殺 我們認輸吧！
We're done, Max! He can't hear me. This is murder. We've had enough.

1382
01:51:06,443 --> 01:51:09,003
- 我把語音辨識關掉了 - 又怎樣？他聽不到我的聲音了
- I'm disabling the voice recognition. - He can't hear me!

1383
01:51:09,112 --> 01:51:11,444
- 是的 但是他看得到你！ - 你說什么？
- Yes, but he can see you! - What?

1384
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,817
我切換到映射模式 你要教他怎么做
I'm putting him in shadow mode. Show him what to do.

1385
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,285
不用語音辨識模式 它可以移動的更快
Without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!

1386
01:51:18,388 --> 01:51:19,548
不行 不行！
No way. No way!

1387
01:51:19,856 --> 01:51:21,824
看看他們 他們已經被打暈了！
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1388
01:51:22,325 --> 01:51:24,384
那個有錢女孩已經抓著他指指點點了！
Rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!

1389
01:51:24,494 --> 01:51:26,519
你知道為什么嗎？因為他們已經害怕了
Do you know why? Because they're scared.

1390
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,991
因為Atom可以做到其他機器人做不到的
Because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.

1391
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,964
- 但是我做不到 - 行的 你可以的
- But I can't do it! - Yes, you can.

1392
01:51:31,067 --> 01:51:33,865
- 我不行啦 - 不 你行的
- I can't. - Yes, you can.

1393
01:51:35,004 --> 01:51:38,462
讓他知道怎么做 你必須自己戰斗最后一個回合
Show him what to do. You have to fight the last round.

1394
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:40,140
不要拜托我 不要
Don't ask me. Don't.

1395
01:51:40,243 --> 01:51:44,839
Charlie... 拜托 我求你
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1396
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,980
你要用那個小狗眼神“殺”死我？
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1397
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:58,327
該死的！
Damn it!

1398
01:51:58,428 --> 01:51:59,486
耶！
Yes!

1399
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:01,888
真不敢相信我會這么做
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1400
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:05,332
我知道你能了解 不管你是不是聽得到
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what,

1401
01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:06,868
但是我確定你了解
but I know you're in there!

1402
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,234
- 肯頓 打還是不打？- 打 給我一分鐘
- Kenton. In or out? - In. Give me a minute.

1403
01:52:12,842 --> 01:52:17,404
我知道你聽不見我說的 但是你可以看得到我 所以看著我
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!

1404
01:52:17,514 --> 01:52:20,176
仔細看著...我
Watch... me.

1405
01:52:20,283 --> 01:52:23,946
- 你知道你是對一個機器人講話 - 我知道 閉嘴！
- You know you're talking to a robot. - I know. Shut up.

1406
01:52:25,054 --> 01:52:26,612
注意看著我
Watch me.

1407
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:29,081
這場如史詩般的大戰已經
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1408
01:52:29,192 --> 01:52:31,285
馬上要進入第五回合 最后的一個回合
as the fifth and final round gets underway.

1409
01:52:31,394 --> 01:52:33,021
來吧 Atom！
Come on, Atom!

1410
01:52:42,539 --> 01:52:44,939
等一下 你有沒有看到？
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1411
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:48,169
Charlie肯頓正在場外映射指導回擊
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

1412
01:52:48,278 --> 01:52:50,473
看來Atom有動作映射功能
It looks like Atom has a shadow function.

1413
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,447
所以基本上 Charlie肯頓就像是
So, basically, that means Charlie Kenton

1414
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:56,417
在最后一個回合自己上場對抗宙斯
is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.

1415
01:52:56,519 --> 01:53:01,115
但是看起來一點幫助都沒有 Atom又被逼到了角落
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.

1416
01:53:03,159 --> 01:53:05,059
幫幫他！ 還擊！
Help him! Fight back!

1417
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:06,253
還不到時候
Not yet.

1418
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:13,597
松本親自監督宙斯的操作人員
Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down,

1419
01:53:13,903 --> 01:53:16,633
憤怒的想馬上擊倒Atom 結束比賽
furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.

1420
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,666
告訴各位大家 拳王看起來累了
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.

1421
01:53:20,977 --> 01:53:23,207
拳王看起來已經沒力了
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1422
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,382
不敢相信！Atom在挑釁宙斯
I don't believe it. Atom is taunting Zeus.

1423
01:53:29,485 --> 01:53:33,114
- 切換到渦輪加速！ - 他認為還不夠！
- Switch to turbo! - He's actually asking for more.

1424
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:36,615
拜托救救他！
Please do something!

1425
01:53:36,926 --> 01:53:39,156
- 還不到時候 - 對了 Charlie 還沒到時候
- Not yet. - That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1426
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:43,296
現在使出活塞拳！
Nitrous pistons, now!

1427
01:53:46,436 --> 01:53:48,404
他已經沒有辦法再支持住了
He's not going to last much longer!

1428
01:53:48,504 --> 01:53:50,438
- 回擊！ - 還不到時候
- Fight back! - Not yet.

1429
01:53:51,207 --> 01:53:52,469
堅持住！
Hang in there!

1430
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:58,036
Atom對宙斯的機關槍拳一點都沒有辦法招架
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1431
01:53:59,215 --> 01:54:03,049
Atom！ Atom！ Atom！ Atom！
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1432
01:54:06,356 --> 01:54:08,483
等他沒力 等他力竭！ 還沒！
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1433
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:13,187
宙斯慢下來了！
Zeus is slowing down!

1434
01:54:13,296 --> 01:54:16,163
拳王的動力已經接近報廢了
The champ's power core is clearly depleted.

1435
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,324
Charlie 拜托！
Charlie, please!

1436
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:20,661
嗨 小鬼！
Hey, kid.

1437
01:54:21,537 --> 01:54:23,129
- 時候到了 - 現在！
- Now. - Now!

1438
01:54:28,411 --> 01:54:29,469
靠近他！
Get in there!

1439
01:54:32,048 --> 01:54:34,312
揍扁這個婊子 打的他開花！
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1440
01:54:43,259 --> 01:54:44,624
耶！ 這就對了！
Yeah! That's right!

1441
01:54:46,195 --> 01:54:47,423
想想辦法！！
Do something!

1442
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:49,356
走開！
Move!

1443
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:53,224
最高級別 切換到手動控制！
Override. Switching to manual.

1444
01:54:55,271 --> 01:55:00,106
松本吃驚的舉動 他竟然親手手動操作他的機器人
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!

1445
01:55:10,553 --> 01:55:13,249
- 攻擊身體！ 靠近他！ - 打倒他 Atom！
- Work the body! Get inside him! - Get him, Atom!

1446
01:55:15,024 --> 01:55:19,518
大家看啊！拳王現在只能拼命的想辦法站著
Look at this! The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet,

1447
01:55:19,629 --> 01:55:24,794
但是肯頓一點都不留情 一拳一拳的轟炸宙斯的身體！
but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!

1448
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,371
左！右！左！右！
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1449
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:14,644
Atom打出一記重要的上勾拳！ 宙斯倒下了！
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1450
01:56:19,355 --> 01:56:22,518
這個小機器人今天晚上的頑強表現
This little bot has dug deep here tonight

1451
01:56:22,625 --> 01:56:25,355
深深的觸動每一個人的心
and shown something damn near heart!

1452
01:56:25,461 --> 01:56:29,659
1 2 3......
One, two, three,

1453
01:56:29,766 --> 01:56:34,703
4 5 6 7......
four, five, six, seven...

1454
01:56:34,804 --> 01:56:35,828
宙斯站起來了！
He's good!

1455
01:56:36,139 --> 01:56:39,472
宙斯已經快站不住了 但是肯頓及...
Zeus gets to his feet, but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1456
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,338
...Atom沒有放過他 拳如雨下！
landing punch after punch!

1457
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,810
松本跟他的超級機器人一點都沒有辦法回應
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.

1458
01:56:44,113 --> 01:56:47,207
宙斯夾住了Atom的左臂 但是肯頓一點都不懼怕
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!

1459
01:56:47,316 --> 01:56:50,285
局面竟然到了這個地步 各位！
It all comes down to this, folks!

1460
01:56:50,386 --> 01:56:52,286
甩開他 Charlie！ 就是現在！
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1461
01:56:52,388 --> 01:56:55,380
- 肯頓已經快把冠軍... - 不 鈴聲響起來了
- Kenton is about to drop the champ... - No! There's the bell!

1462
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,621
鈴聲救了宙斯！！
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1463
01:57:05,535 --> 01:57:08,436
不可思議 比賽進入到裁判判決
Amazingly, we will go to the judges' cards!

1464
01:57:19,526 --> 01:57:20,686
去吧！

1465
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:25,884
各位先生女士們 經過了五個艱苦的回合以后
Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds,

1466
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:28,749
裁判的判決已經出來了

1469
01:57:42,438 --> 01:57:47,171

And Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46,

1470
01:57:47,276 --> 01:57:52,475
世界冠軍成功的保住了他的冠軍頭銜
for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1471
01:57:52,582 --> 01:57:54,880
宙斯！
Zeus!

1472
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:04,486
法拉 蘭蔻娃
Farra Lemkova,

1473
01:58:04,594 --> 01:58:06,892
妳的機器人今天晚上的表現比你們說的差多了
you got way more than you bargained for tonight.

1474
01:58:07,196 --> 01:58:10,563
有人說你的機器人贏了判決 但是輸了比賽
Some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.

1475
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:12,596
她看起來很不爽
She looks pissed.

1476
01:58:13,302 --> 01:58:15,532
比賽過程比我們想象的還要久一點
It took a little longer than we thought,

1477
01:58:15,638 --> 01:58:18,835
但是結果還是如預期的一樣
but the result is as expected.

1478
01:58:20,276 --> 01:58:24,645
我們贏了 宙斯還是永遠不敗的
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1479
01:58:26,895 --> 01:58:28,895
松本先生 我想問的是...

1480
01:58:29,919 --> 01:58:33,252
對于你們今晚這場那么羞辱的比賽 被慘痛的修理...
Any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss

1481
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:34,618
...還差點輸了 你有沒有話要說？
your bot suffered tonight?

1482
01:58:37,627 --> 01:58:40,255
- 沒說 - 不予置評
- Nothing. - No comment.

1483
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,694
Max Max在哪里？
Max. Where's Max?

1484
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:46,528
他在那里...Max！
There he is. Max.

1485
01:58:48,304 --> 01:58:51,705
大家都稱你的機器人是“平民冠軍"
They're already calling your bot "the people's champion."

1486
01:58:55,244 --> 01:58:57,007
你怎么說呢？
What do you say to that?

1487
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,470
平民冠軍？
People's champion?

1488
01:59:01,918 --> 01:59:03,442
對我來說 很好！
Sounds pretty good to me.

1489
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,417
爹？爹！
Dad? Dad!

1490
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:16,558
爹！
Dad!

1491
01:59:27,476 --> 01:59:29,000
我真的想讓你知道
I really want you to know...

1492
01:59:29,312 --> 01:59:31,371
不 你需要知道...
No, I need you to know.

1493
01:59:33,482 --> 01:59:34,710
不用擔心
Don't worry.

1494
01:59:35,718 --> 01:59:37,481
我會保密的
Your secret's safe with me.

1495
01:59:44,527 --> 01:59:46,290
等一下！
Wait here. Wait here.

1496
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:32,668
耶！
Yes!

1497
02:00:35,918 --> 02:00:36,918
