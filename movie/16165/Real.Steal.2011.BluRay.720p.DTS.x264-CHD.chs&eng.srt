- 你还欠我三万元 - Jack 我马上可以还你
- You're into me for 30 grand. - Jack, I'm going to pay you.

7
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,852
我不是Jack 我是比尔
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.

8
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,482
你还欠Jack钱？你最好先还我
You owe Jack money, too? You pay me first!

9
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:34,359
比尔 兄弟 钱我准备好了 就在我手上
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your money. It's right here in my hand.

10
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,364

Why don't we meet up on the?

11
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,906
- 喂？你的讯号很差 - 我听不到你
- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello? - I'm losing you.

12
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,498
我听不清楚你说什么...
I can't hear what you're say...

13
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,743
先生您好 那个是突击者号吗？
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

14
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,644
- 是的 - 我们可以看看吗？

15
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,386
- 你们想看？- 耶
- You want to see him? - Yeah.

16
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,753

20
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,484
噢 小妹妹 你要干嘛？
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

21
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,891
我可不可以跟他照个像？
Can we get a picture with him?

22
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,657
当然可以 五块钱
Sure. For five dollars.

23
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,857
照个像要五元？你开玩笑吧？
You want five dollars? Seriously?

24
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,594
没开玩笑 马上给我五元
No, I want five dollars immediately.

25
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,398

- 好啦！我开玩笑的 三元就好 - 你慢慢想吧
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks. - Whatever.

27
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:56,104
- 那就二块半好了？- 你这个逊咔！
- How about $2.50? - You suck!

28
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,747
又是一个乡巴佬小镇 是吧？
It's going to be one of those towns, huh?

29
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,588
各位先生女士们 欢迎来到2020年圣兰卓乡村市集
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

30
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,148
各位请坐 我们将要开始了
Please take your seats. We're almost ready to get this thing started.

31
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:15,897
讲好的是我的机器人对抗800磅的牛
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.

32
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,728
那只牛绝对不止800磅 你这个呆头
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

33
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:23,795
Charlie"无所不能小子" 肯顿 看来你也老了 老朋友
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time has not been good to you, my friend.

34
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,536
- 里奇 麻烦大了 - 不要激动 老朋友
- Ricky, we got a big problem here. - Slow down there, hoss.

35
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:33,138
最后一次我们的见面是在桑休士顿中心
Last time I saw you, you were staring at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

36
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,747
我正好赏你一记右叉拳
with the taste of my right cross all over your face.

37
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,685
- 准备好了吗？- 耶
- Are we good to go here? - Yeah.

38
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,657
说好的是我的机器人对抗800磅的牛 代价是三千元
We agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,489
- 真的嘛？- 是的 说好的是这样
- Am I right? - Yes, sir. We did.

40
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,620
但是那只牛看起来大概是2000磅
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

41
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,220
打个商量
I'll tell you something.

42
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:53,730
如果你的机器人不打 你一分钱都拿不到 怎么样？
Your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! How about that?

43
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,163
滚吧你！
Get the hell out of here.

44
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,842
要不要赌大一点 我的机器人跟你的牛对打
Why don't we make this more interesting. My bot against your bull, straight up.

45
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,006
- 赌多少？- 二万 胜方独赢
- How much? - Twenty grand, winner takes all.

46
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,778
- 二万？你有钱可以赌？- 藏在我车上
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand? - In a safe in my truck.

47
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:14,746
Charlie 好吧！
All right, Charlie.

48
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:18,987
二万就二万 但是如果你输了绕跑
Twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,

49
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,586
我见你一次就海扁你一次
I'll come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.

50
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,858
你知道我没骗你 因为我时常在扁你
You know that I can do that because I already done done it!

51
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,800
别靠我那么那么近 你这个拳击场上的娘娘腔 到底比不比？
In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

52
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:33,007
那好 握手然后“嘣” 像以前一样 你要不要再被我扁？
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that once again. You want to dance again?

53
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:36,567
帮这家伙加加油 给他点好运 他需要点运气 耶！
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck. He needs some luck, y'all.

54
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,673
不要再惹那只牛！
Don't touch that bull.

55
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,876
各位先生女士们 我来问一下；
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

56
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,545
这里有没有人是机器人拳击赛的粉丝？
do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?

57
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,216
各位好朋友 注意听着 我了解………
Now, listen, friends, I understand

58
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:54,121
不是每个人都可以付得起300元的门票
we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas

59
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,167
然后一路到达拉斯去看世界杯机器人拳击大赛！
and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights.

60
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,567
所以我决定给你们带来一场机器人拳击比赛
So, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match

61
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,039
就在这里 我们的圣卓兰乡村市集上
right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.

62
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,575
喜欢吗？
How about that?

63
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:14,772
各位先生女士们 我来介绍
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,

64
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,546
突击者号！
Ambush!

65
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,950
来吧 开始吧！
Let's do it!

66
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:22,954
好样的 大家伙
All right, big fella.

67
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,259
他是不是一个大家伙啊？
He's a big fella, ain't he?

68
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,002
转一圈 让大家看看你有多威猛！
Take a turn. Let them see how beautiful you are.

69
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:39,866
看看你有多有力！
Show them some power.

70
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,843
大家赶快看 他在为我们表演功夫喔
Look at that. He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

71
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,276
耶 大家伙！
Yeah, big fella.

72
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,642
突击者号的对手是年度公牛大赛……
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up

73
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,811
击倒率最高的………
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

74
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,754
各位先生女士们
ladies and gentlemen,

75
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,621
黑色闪电！
Black Thunder!

76
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,758
- 开始吧 - 战斗开始咯
- Let's get it on! - Let's get this thing started.

77
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,963
你就这么点能耐？
Is that all you got?

78
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,937
耶！兄弟 干劲拿出来！
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

79
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,282
干掉他 干掉他！
Take him, take him.

80
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,220
突击者一掌把这只愤怒的牛翻倒在地
Ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.

81
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,155
我还有很多绝招 大家伙 我们才刚暖身
I got more for you, big fella. We're just getting started.

82
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,124
准备 现在 跳
OK. Jump, now!

83
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,804
突击者一掴掀翻黑色闪电
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

84
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:53,211
但是当你惹毛一只公牛 你就最好小心他们的牛角
but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.

85
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,350
噢 你喜欢是吧！我看得出来 喜欢这个
You like that. I can tell. You like that.

86
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,382
转身小心
Turn around!

87
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,822
里奇！里奇！够了我们认输！
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

88
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,874
来吧！我们还要战斗 跳 跳一下 ！
Come on. We're still in this thing. Just hop. Hop.

89
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,304
就是这样 来吧！
That's it. Come on.

90
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,976
里奇 够了！ 我们认输！
Ricky, enough! Enough!

91
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,249
你的机器人被痛扁的声音盖过了你的声音
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.

92
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,850
杀了他！杀了他！杀了他！
Kill! Kill! Kill!

93
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,387
快点 站起来！

00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:41,830
站起来！快点！
Get up! Come on!

95
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,392

不要！不要！不要！
Come on, no. No, no, no!

97
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:03,043
各位先生女士们 让我们为我们的勇士喝彩吧！

All right! That was ridiculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

105
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:28,766
Charlie男孩 等下我来拿钱 你最好准备好！
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy. You best have it.

106
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,937
- 大家一起喊 "嗨！" - 嗨！
- Everybody say "hey!" - Hey!

107
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,847
- 大家一起喊 "喝！" - 喝！
- Everybody say "ho!" - Ho!

108
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,147
拽不起来了吧？哈哈！小机器人！
How about that? How you doing there, little robot?

109
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,462
我的钥匙 他妈的！
My keys, damn it.

110
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,364
再靠近一步 我就狠狠的扁你一顿
One more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

111
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:00,874
Charlie 不要紧张
Charlie, relax.

112
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,877
我不会付钱 那是不公平的比赛 甚至花了我最后一个机器人！
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus fight. It cost me my last robot.

113
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,846
- 让我们先说 - 你还记得卡洛琳法罗吗？
- Just listen to us. - Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

114
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,419
她是我的前女友 我已经十年没见过她了 她想干嘛？
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen her in ten years. What does she want?

115
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,248
她死了
Nothing. She died.

116
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,488
你还记不记得Max
Do you recall Max Kenton?

117
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,123
他是我儿子 他应该已经九岁了
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

118
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,956
- 十一岁 - 十一岁 好吧！
- Eleven. - Eleven. OK.

119
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,954
他也死了？
Is he dead, too?

120
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:25,898
不 他还好好的 所以我们才来
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

121
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,148
翻译：闲闲的猛男 校对：目前没有

123
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,262
他的监护权的所属

Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased. Father, Charles Kenton.

125
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,130

Debra Fallon Barnes, you're the boy's aunt.

126
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:10,543
是的 就像我所表达的 我的先生 马文 他很健康
Yes. As I've already told you, my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

127
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,213
我们可以好好的照顾Max 
and we can more than provide for Max.

128
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,843
我认为这样很好 但是根据德州的法律
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will

129
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,887
如果他没出席的生父Charlie肯顿
next of kin retains custody.

130
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,152
没有放弃他的抚养权的话
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing,

131
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,556
我们还在等他出席
and we are expecting him...

132
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,294
我要一个新的机器人
I need a new robot now.

133
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,887
我帮突击者在下周六安排一场大比赛
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.

134
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,296
我现在要赶去处理一件事
I got to show up with something.

135
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,303
大声公要卖吗？大声公是杀手级的！
Noisy Boy is for sale? In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

136
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:39,101
多少钱？很划算 有没有其他的毛病？
How much? That's a good deal. What's wrong with him?

137
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,471
我要买
I can live with that.

138
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,277
但是我现在没有钱
I don't have it.

139
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,441
Charlie肯顿在Max一出生的时候就没有尽到父亲的义务
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.

140
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,179
我们可以更好地照顾Max
I can more than provide for Max.

141
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:54,616
你是Charlie肯顿吗？
Please be Charles Kenton.

142
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,257
是的 就是Charlie
Charlie, yeah.

143
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:02,997
我来签一些文件 放弃一些权力
I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights

144
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,066
放弃我小孩的监护权
to the custody of my son.

145
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,101
所以我才来 我是应该来吧？
That's why I'm here. Do I need to be here?

146
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,465
Charlie
Charlie.

147
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:10,995
你还记得我吗？
Do you even remember me?

148
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,307
- 黛博拉 卡洛琳的妹妹 - 是哦 黛博拉 你还好吗？
- Debra, Caroline's sister. - Yeah, Debra. How are you?

149
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,344
肯顿先生 请坐！
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

150
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,942
法官大人 我可以先去看看我的外甥吗？
Your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?

151
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,076
可以！请去吧！
Yes, you may.

152
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,983
- 你呢？肯顿先生！ - 什么？
- How about you, Mr. Kenton? - What?

153
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,522
如果你想要 你可以跟你儿子独处一会儿！
You can spend some time with him, if you'd like.

154
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,353
- 跟我儿子？- 是的 你儿子！
- With the kid? - Yeah, the kid.

155
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,359
- Max 你儿子！ - 好的！
- Max. Your son? - All right.

156
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,259
你跟机器人在一起太久了 现在也像机器一样没有感情
You've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.

157
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,034
宝贝 你在这里等一下 我马上回来
Honey, you wait right here. I'm going to be back.

158
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,534
甜心 不急 慢慢来！
You take all the time you need, sweetheart.

159
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:50,139
法官大人 如果可以的话 这么重要的事
Your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture,

160
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,942
我想出去一下跟我的律师商量一下！
step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.

161
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,072
当然可以！
Please.

162
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:02,055
来吧！你怎么还不来？
Come on. Come on. There you are.

163
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,687
他会被领养的
He'll be in a foster home.

164
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:10,091
他们会找到一个年轻有活力的家庭的 是的！
No, they find good families. Young. Energetic. Yeah.

165
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,725
感谢你 麦克 我会的 好的
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

166
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,100
- 马文巴恩 我是黛博拉的先生 - 是哦 耶！
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband. - Right, yeah.

167
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,179
黛博拉是真的很想领养Max
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

168
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,550
- 我是很想完成他的愿望 - 七万五千元
- I'm up for it. But... - Seventy-five grand.

169
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,744
七万五千元？你是说真的？
$75,000? You're serious?

170
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,085
还有一件事是...
The thing is...

171
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,289
...我们这个夏天要去意大利度假
we're supposed to go to Italy this summer

172
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:43,160
跟我最好的朋友及他太太
with my oldest friend and his wife.

173
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:45,324
二个月都在图斯卡尼
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

174
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,765
只有你们四个 听起来不错！
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

175
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:49,299
我们八月底才会回来纽约
We'll be back in New York by the end of August.

176
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,267
到八月 那就十万
In August. A hundred.

177
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,309
- 十万？- 没错
- $100,000? - You heard me.

178
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,641
- 你疯了吗？- 没有比你太太还疯
- You're crazy. - Not nearly as crazy as your wife

179
00:14:57,746 --> 00:15:01,238
如果我把儿子的抚养权签给了德州政府
if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.

180
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,013
那么你太太就得不到他想要的
There's a real way everyone gets what they want here.

181
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,247
所以我建议你这样做
So here's what you're going to do.

182
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,416
你告诉你的太太我只会把抚养权给他
You're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her

183
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,653
如果我能跟我儿子共度一个暑假
if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.

184
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,321
就说我真的很愧疚
Just tell her how guilty she made me feel

185
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,626
我一直没有尽到父亲的责任
for being such a terrible absentee dad,

186
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:22,033
我多想补偿小孩一些父亲的天伦之乐
how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

187
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:26,073
她会买账的 然后大家都得到自己想要的
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero and everybody wins.

188
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,707
好吧 但是不准告诉黛伯拉有关钱的事
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?

189
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,343
我了解
I understand.

190
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,646
今晚我们载Max过去的时候 我会先付你五万块
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max

191
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,221
然后等我们八月回来 再付你五万
and the other 50 when we get back in August

192
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,222
而且你要带他到纽约给我们
and you deliver him to us in New York.

193
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,488
很高兴跟你做生意
Pleasure doing business with you.

194
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,593
法官大人 很高兴我们都仔细的考虑
Your Honor, I'm happy we all took the time

195
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,325
作出对每个人都好的决定
to make the best decision for everyone.

196
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,364
- 高兴吗？- 是的 是我
- Happy? - Yeah, it's me.

197
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:59,703
我要买下大声公 我有钱了
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

198
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,470
把它带到泰利健身房 我等一下就到
Take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.

199
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:18,717
哈？
Hello?

200
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,324
百丽？
Bailey?

201
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,159
有人在这里等你付钱
Some guy is here with the robot you're buying,

202
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,529
千万不要放我鸽子
and it smells like disaster to me.

203
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,124
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to see you, too.

204
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,137
- 你知道你很可爱吗？- 少来一套
- Might I also say how cute you look. - Give it up.

205
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,675
天啊 我要冲个凉 你也要吗？一起来吧！
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower? Come on.

206
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,607
我要说清楚一件事
Let me make something clear.

207
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,612
有个可怕的人带着个机器人
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

208
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:41,148
坐在健身房门口等我二个小时了
has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.

209
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,150
如果暂时先不考虑这件在我家门口的黑市交易
Putting aside the fact that you're doing

210
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,880
你怎么付这个钱？
what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep,

211
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,156
你不是刚毁了突击者号？
how will you pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?

212
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,157
钱快到了 安抚他一下！
The money is on its way. Just distract him.

213
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,590
我一直在安抚他 我快累死了！
I have been. It's exhausting.

214
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,627
- 你最好了 - 耶？是吗？
- You're the best. - Yeah? Really?

215
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,755
那就是你刚买了四万五千元的机器人但是你还欠我六千的房租？
Is that why you're buying a $45,000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

216
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:58,355
- 因为我最好说话？- 三千
- Because I'm the best? - Three.

217
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:03,700
六千 而且告诉你 已经有人要买下我的地方了
Six. There is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.

218
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:06,172
少来了 你不会真的想卖掉你老爸留给你的健身房？
Come on. Like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.

219
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,335
如果你不付房租 我也付不出钱 那我就逼不得已了
If you don't make rent, I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.

220
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,379
你父亲会从坟墓里面爬起来踢你的
Your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass

221
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,311
- 如果你卖了这个地方 - 我父亲会爬出他的坟墓
- if you sold this place. - My father would climb out of his grave

222
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,712
踢你的屁股
and kick your ass.

223
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,443
百丽？
Bailey?

224
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:25,550
- 不要 - 不要做什么？
- Don't. - Don't what?

225
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,219
不要那么做
Don't do that.

226
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,323
- 不要做什么？- 不要做那种小狗表情
- Don't what? - Don't do that thing.

227
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,699
- 不对 你喜欢拳击 - 不对
- No, you like that thing. - No.

228
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,897
- 是的 - 不对 我不喜欢拳击
- Yeah. - No, I don't like that thing.

229
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:42,166
我习惯了 简单地说 但是我现在喜欢钱
I used to. Once. Briefly. Now I like money more.

230
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,871
- 我不相信你 - 我不管
- I don't believe you. - I don't care.

231
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,441
马文
Marvin.

232
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,511
钱到了
Your money has arrived.

233
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,847
马文
Marv.

234
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,555
五万 说好的
Fifty grand, as promised.

235
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:08,631
这个是我们的号码及我们在欧洲的联络方式
Here are all our numbers and contact info over in Europe.

236
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,466
嗯 所以都安排好了
So that's everything there.

237
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:16,241
马文告诉我你想跟马克思小聚一段时间
So Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.

238
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,542
- 是的 - 你做的很对
- Yeah. - You did the right thing,

239
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,773
把监护权给我
giving me custody.

240
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,372
卡洛琳也会希望你这么做
Caroline would have wanted that.

241
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:25,313
现在 请八月27号准时带Max到纽约给我们
Now, have him back in New York on August 27th.

242
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,782
没问题
That's a deal.

243
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,483
好的 我们去接Max 好的 ？我们去接Max
OK, let's go get Max. OK? Let's get Max.

244

还好吗？你要到另外一边 我来带Max？
It's OK. You want to go around the other side here and I'll get Max?

245
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:44,395
嗨 Max 再见 小老弟
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

246
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,908
亲爱的Max 我们暑假过后见
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.

247
00:18:57,819 --> 00:18:59,309

I'm Charlie.

248
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,819
好久不见了 我是...
It's been a long time. You know, I'm your...

249
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,987
- 你搞死我了 - 嘴巴真干净
- You screwed me. - Nice mouth.

250
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,355
你知道他们现在要去哪里？
Do you know where they're going?

251
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,398
- 意大利？- 是啊 意大利
- Italy? - Yeah, Italy.

252
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,797
那我为什么要跟你呆在这个鸟地方？
So how did I get stuck here with you?

253
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,802
不要激动 你还有后面一辈子的时间跟他们在一起
Relax, kid. You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.

254
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,928
Charlie
Charlie!

255
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,637
那个老兄气疯了 他要走了！
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

256
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,844
- 马文给你钱了吗？- 来 刚刚给了
- Did Marvin give you that money? - Here, just close the deal.

257
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:25,573
我等下过去 好吗？
I'll be right there, OK?

258
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:32,687
- 我是百丽 - Max
- I'm Bailey. - Max.

259
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,751
Max 肯顿
Max Kenton.

260
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,018
- 这是你的... - 是的我儿子
- So this is your... - Yeah, it's him.

261
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,625
不要担心好吗？
Don't worry about it, OK?

262
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,326
我要照顾你们二个跟...
I'm looking at you two and...

263
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,696
请把大声公放在店里好吗？谢谢你！
Just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.

264
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,608
我出去的时候 你跟百丽呆在店里好吗？
You're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.

265
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,577
- 他给你多少钱？- 你误会了
- How much did he give you? - You're coming at this the wrong way.

266
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,442
不 告诉我 我要知道
No, tell me. I want to know.

267
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,747
好吧！五万元
Fifty thousand, OK?

268
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,342
他给我五万元来让我放弃你
He gave me $50,000 to sign you over to her.

269
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,853
你可以住嘴吗？
Will you shut up now?

270
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,682
你把我卖了？
You sold me?

271
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,482
没有那么糟！
Sounds worse than it is.

272
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:14,357
- 真的？- 那是对你最好的
- Really. - It's to take care of you.

273
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,794
那我要分账分一半
Give me half the money and you won't have to.

274
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,661
- 你要去哪里？- 把钱给我 我自己会照顾自己
- Where are you going to go? - Give me the money. I'll be fine.

275
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,031
我答应你阿姨 暑假结束的时候会送你去纽约的
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.

276
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,769
现在你只在乎黛博拉阿姨？
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

277
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:26,029
你用五万把我卖掉 你欠我二万五
You sold me for 50 grand. You owe me half!

278
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:30,607
我没有钱 我把钱花在机器人身上 花完了 没钱了！
I don't have it! I spent the money on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

279
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,009
我完蛋了
I'm through here.

280
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,724
你买了什么？
What do we got?

281
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,587
大声公到了
Noisy Boy has arrived.

282
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,056
贴满了海关及航空公司的标签
That's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.

283
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:51,799
- 他到过世界的每个角落 - 伦敦 日本 巴西 巴尔的摩...
- He's been all over the world. - London, Japan, Brazil, So Paulo...

284
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,528
这二年还没有到过北美
Hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.

285
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:56,763
或许是因为这样 价格才那么便宜 天才！
Maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.

286
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,431
决定留下来了？
Decided to stay?

287
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:05,069
百丽会照顾你几个礼拜
This is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.

288
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,940
这几周请帮我照顾小孩
I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks.

289
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,848
- 我要一半的钱 - 你还要讨论这个？
- I want half that money. - Are we back to this again?

290
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,621
那个是真正的搏击机器人？
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

291
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:16,418
大声公 你有没有听过它？
Noisy Boy's in there. You ever heard of him?

292
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,017
当然 它在2016年跟罗比肯争夺世界冠军
Of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.

293
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,426
老天爷 他看起来太好了！
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

294
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:34,102
它的盔甲已经换过了 我们看看里面的零件是不是一样好
His composite armor has been replaced. Let's see if the insides look as good.

295
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,936
我已经反复看过他跟罗比肯的比赛快20次了
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.

296
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,843
它实在应该在第三回合击败他的
He should have had him in the third round,

297
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,712
但是罗比肯打出一记幸运的右拳 结束了！
but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.

298
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,723
不要激动 他现在是我们的了
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

299
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,825
- 不好玩 - 有点好玩
- Not funny. - Kind of funny.

300
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,528
你知道他有声控装置吧？
You know he has voice recognition, right?

301
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,434
- 不 没有吧？- 他不是普通级别的
- No, he doesn't. - He didn't in the League.

302
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,473
当大声公在巴西的时候 他们应该装上的
When Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.

303
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,066
巴西人就是喜欢对机器人说话的那种怪咔
Brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

304
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,743
右 左 上击拳！
Right, left, uppercut!

305
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:20,883
坏掉了！ 右 左 上击拳！
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

306
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,184
我就知道便宜没好货的
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.

307
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,926
- 让我看看 我来修修看 - 看看它有多好吧！
- Let me see if I can fix it. - Look how good he looks, too.

308
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,018
二秒就好 我看看！
Give me two seconds. Let me look at something!

309
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,496
- 你为什么不验验货？- 不要紧张
- Why didn't you ask to look at it? - Relax!

310
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,501
你是不是用日文？
Was that Japanese?

311
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,101
我看看可不可以切换到英文！
Let me see if I can reset him to English.

312
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:45,804
你怎么会讲日文？
How do you know Japanese?

313
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:47,506
电视游戏
Video games.

314
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,111
你会玩日文游戏？
You play video games in Japanese?

315
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,947
走私来的日本游戏都比较好的
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

316
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,157
给我吧
Give me that.

317
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,662
已经改到英文模式 而且我找到他的命令集了
He's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.

318
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,994
制造商已经预设了很多的组合拳了
They have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.

319
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,591
他们应该要附个说明书的
They should be listed here.

320
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:10,929
上下击拳组合
Top salvo!

- 把钥匙给我 - 我要跟你一起去
- Give me the keys. - I'm coming with you.

327
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,869
- 你不能去 - 为什么？

328
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,840
因为我不想让你去 好吗？
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

329

让我一起去 不然你就只能到下水沟钓你的钥匙了
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.

Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

- 不要再那样做 - 吓到你了是吧？
- Don't do that again. - That's scaring you, isn't it?

333
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,787
不要再那样做是吗？
Don't do this again?

We should take an undercard fight, make a little cash and get out of here!

- 是的！ 上吧 制造噪音吧！！ - 你说卡片 是吗？
- Yeah! Go, Noisy! - Undercard, huh?

387
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:36,920
激波拳
Shockfist!

388

00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,661
干掉他！重力拳 直捣面门
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

390
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,660
真TMD疯了！
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

391
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,403
金属的世仇 来吧！
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

左拳！ 痛苦的革命者！
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

393
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,241
让我给你一个礼物
I got something for you.

394
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,477
你敢逃开？你没有办法躲开！
Don't you run from me! You can't run from me!

395
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:10,650
站起来
Get up!

396
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,054
犯规了
That's illegal!

397
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,256
这是地下拳击 没有规则的
This is the underworld. There are no rules!

398
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,632
现在我们看迈达斯发飙了
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

399
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,128
不 手举起来！
No. Hands up!

400
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,296
回到角落来 婊子 像男人一样大口喘气
Get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!

401
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,972
他要被干掉了...
He's getting killed in there!

402
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:36,613
用耳机组 告诉它怎么做！
It's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!

403
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,180
恐惧盾牌！
Panic Shield!

404
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,180
对了 对了 一二组合拳！
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

405
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:47,989
不 不 粉碎拳
No, no. Shatter Punch!

406
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,997

407
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,175
贾布 贾布！
Jab, jab!

408
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:09,608
右环拳！
Right roundhouse!

409
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:13,209
大声公是不是刚刚把它的机油溅到马达斯脸上？
Did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?

410
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,983
千万不可把机油溅到马达斯脸上
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

411
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,422
让我们狂欢吧 撞击宫殿！
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

412
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,618
用你的左拳！
Use your left!

413
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,426
大声公试着用一只手来对抗
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!

414
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,693
但是迈达斯夹住了他！然后好好的教训他！
But Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!

415
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:33,467
不 不 起来！
No, no! Get up!

416
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:36,267
吃这个！
Get some!

417
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,080
移动！ 离开角落！
Move! Get out of the corner!

418
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,548
迈达斯！迈达斯！迈达斯！
Midas! Midas! Midas!

419
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:48,778
有人已经准备好送上卡布奇诺了！
Somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!

420
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,115
我要送你一个大礼 准备好了？
I got something for you! You ready?

421
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:56,463
晚安！迈达斯的最后一击！
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

422
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,397
再见吧 大声公！
And so long to Noisy Boy.

423
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:33,263
太逊了 你饿了吗？
That sucked. You hungry?

424
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,136
我救回了大声公的声控控制面板
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.

425
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,105
除了那个以外 已经变垃圾了 我要再找一个新机器人
Other than that, he's trash. I got to get a new robot together.

426
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,836
我需要一个主机 什么？
I need to find a mainframe. What?

427
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,374
- 我不喜欢汉堡 - 什么样的小孩不喜欢汉堡？
- I hate hamburgers. - What kid hates burgers?

428
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,779
好吧 我可以多吃一些 这个给你喝
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

429
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,641
你根本不该参加那场打斗的
You never should have taken that fight.

430
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,118
真的？真的？多谢你 天才！
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

431
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,520
你总是那么的冲动吗？
Do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?

432
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,819
你根本不知道怎么战斗
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

433
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,426
你知道的组合拳码根本不到一半
Those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.

434
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,260
你的狂妄自大害的它的屁股被踢成二半
You threw them in there cocky and half-assed.

435
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,800
- 你根本没有给他机会 - 大声公没有那么棒！
- You never gave him a chance. - He wasn't that good.

436
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,535
大声公是最好的机器人
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

437
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,435
曾经是 曾经是 大声公以前是很好 以前是
Was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.

438
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,533
但是看看周围 这里是伟大的机器人毁掉的坟场
But look around you. This place is where once great robots go to die.

439
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,202
那就丢掉它？
So throw him away.

440
00:33:18,312 --> 00:33:21,406
这就是你 是吧？你不需要的 就丢掉？
That's what you do, right? Anything you don't need you throw away.

441
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:24,610
哇
Wow.

442
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:28,418
这会是漫长的一夜
It's been a long night.

443
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,718
如果你要在里面睡 闭嘴 上车！
If you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.

444
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,690
不要这样看着我 上车！
Don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!

445
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,152
他们花400买大声公的头
They gave me 400 for his head.

446
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,334
你坐好 我要去找一些零件！
You stay put. I'm going to look for parts.

447
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,471
我也要去 那个饮料让我很兴奋
I'm coming with you. That drink has my heart pounding.

448
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,709
如果我自己坐在车里 我的头会炸掉
If I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.

449
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,409
随便你 但是要跟好
Whatever. Just keep up.

450
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,427
真背
Crap.

451
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,829
退后
Stay back.

452
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,339
好了 跟上！
All right, keep up.

453
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,476
这个探照灯是定时的 你只要知道时间间隔就好
These searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right,

454
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,642
所以跟紧
so stay close.

455
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:09,514
那就对了！
It's all right.

456
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,922
来吧 快点！
Come on, come on.

457
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,429
- 我们会被抓啦！ - 来啦！
- We're going to get caught. - Come on.

458
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,264
慢一点 小心一点
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

459
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,564
快一点 下来这里 快快快
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

460
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,406
机器人都在东边 我们要快一点通过这里
Robots are on the east side. We got to be quick in here.

461
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:33,670
过了这里就没有探照灯了 快 跑！
Once we're through here, there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

462
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,530
- 到了 - 我们要找什么？
- Here it is. - What are we looking for?

463
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,261
可以组合机器人的任何东西
Anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.

464
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,394
- 嗨 你看 - 什么？
- Hey, look. - What?

465
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,531
太小了
It's so small.

466
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:03,371
耶 那个比你还要老
Yeah. That's before your time.

467
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,571
那个是第一代的战斗机器人
That's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.

468
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,878
他们被造的很像人类 越像越好
They wanted them to look like us. The more human, the better.

469
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,782
没想到变得那么快 把这个放进拖车
Crazy how quick everything changed. Put that in the cart.

470
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:16,015
- 什么改变了？- 好问题 人类的拳击
- What changed? - A good question. Human boxing.

471
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,292
- 已经退流行了 - 为什么？
- It just faded. - Why?

472
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,624
因为金钱改变了一切 人们要更血腥 更好看
Because the money moved on. People wanted more carnage, more show.

473
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,825
可以综合巴西柔术 格雷西 日式忍者术
You had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados,

474
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,301
泰拳...几千种不同的武术糅合在一起
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and a thousand styles in between.

475
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:31,735
全部在水泥地上的重击
Full-on ground-and-pound.

476
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,067
- 看看这个 - 这是什么？
- Look at this. - What's that?

477
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,534
我也不知道
I don't know.

478
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:35,904
不错的零件
Not bad. Good spot.

479
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,041
如果还是一个拳手 人类的身体
You still had human fighters, human bodies,

480
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,577
你没有办法给人们他们想要的
so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:

481
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,946
真相是 没有围栏的暴力 这就是人们想要的
True, no-holds-barred violence.

482
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,781
所以符合逻辑的下一步
The next logical step,

483
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,017
把人们移开 让机器来自相残杀
get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.

484
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,517
你会想念真正的拳击吗？
Do you miss it?

485
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,524
- 拳击 你想念吗？- 小心
- Boxing. Do you miss it? - Careful.

486
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,067
什么？我想知道
What? I want to know.

487
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,929
小心一点 你下面是个峭壁
Careful, you're on a cliff.

488
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,643
那下面很深 如果你掉下去 你就绝对...
That's a long way down. If you fell, you'd definitely...

489
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,412
Charlie 救我！
Charlie, help me!

490
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,014
Charlie！
Charlie!

491
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,080
- Charlie！ - Max！
- Charlie! - Max! Max!

492
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,045
Max！
Max!

493
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:01,587
- 不要动！ - 有一个机器人的手勾住了我
- Try not to move! - I'm on some sort of robot arm.

494
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,723
等一下！ 不要动 千万不要动 把手伸过来 慢一点 轻一点
Wait! Just easy, easy. Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

495
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:10,167
要很慢很慢 很好 不要看下面 看着我 看着我 ！
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down. Look at me. Look at me.

496
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:14,168
就是这样！ 我抓住你了！不用怕了 我抓住你了
That's it! I've got you! You don't have to be scared. I got you!

497
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,773
- 下面好深啊 - 没问题了 我抓住你了！
- It's so far! - It's OK. I got you.

498
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,175
把手给我 慢一点 轻一点
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

499
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,840
只要动你的手 把你的手伸过来 慢慢的 递过来
Just give me your other hand very slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

500
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,580
看着我 我们一起来
Look at me. We're going to do this together.

501
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,885
就是你跟我 看着我 对的！
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

502
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:35,451
一 二 三！
One... two... three!

503
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:42,765
就是这样 我抓住你了 我抓住你了！
That's it. I got you! I got you. I got you. I got you.

504
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,672
你安全了 你安全了！
You're safe. You're safe.

505
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,880
没事了 我抓住你了
All right, I got you.

506
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,542
- 你还好吗？- 还好
- You all right? - Yeah.

507
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:01,052
过来这里 慢一点 慢一点
Come here. Easy. Easy.

508
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,188
你还好吗？
You all right?

509
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:05,823
- 你还好吗？- 是的
- You all right? - Yeah.

510
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,860
我告诉你很危险了
I told you it was dangerous.

511
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,186
小心一点 我们还在悬崖边上
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

512
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,204
Charlie 我看到一整个机器人了
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.

513
00:39:26,514 --> 00:39:27,776
那又怎么样？走吧！来吧
So what? Let's go. Come on.

514
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,516
我要带走它 他救了我一命！
I'm taking him with me. He saved my life.

515
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,951
他没有救你一命 是我救得 走吧！
He did not save your life. I saved your life. Let's go.

516
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:37,046
把推车推到边上 我会用卷线拉上去！
Just bring the cart to the edge. I'll use the winch to get him out.

517
00:39:37,158 --> 00:39:40,685
你要捡这个垃圾 你自己推车 我不玩了
You want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.

518
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,291
这是大声公剩下的零件？
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

519
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:28,625
是的
That's it.

520
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,296
他的头已经变成撞击宫殿大门上的装潢了
His head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.

521
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,669
- 正经一点 - 我们再做一个机器人
- It's not funny. - Let's get a robot, you and me.

522
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:38,904
好点子 只不过你破产了 我也快了
Good idea. You're broke. I'm almost there myself.

523
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,880
- 你搞砸了你最好的一次机会了 - 我们可以一起做出来的
- You destroyed the best shot you had. - We'll put one together.

524
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,210
你是那么聪明 这里又有那么多好零件
You're brilliant at this. There's good stuff here.

525
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,649
- 这里什么都没有 - 有啊 你看！
- There's nothing here. - There is. Look.

526
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,722
这些都是垃圾... 垃圾
All your junk is... it's junk.

527
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,918
你甚至已经没有办法参加比赛了
You're not even in the game any more.

528
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,961
- 都是垃圾 - 我知道了 都是垃圾
- It's all garbage. - I heard you. It's garbage.

529
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,825
不要对我大声
Don't get loud with me.

530
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,831
- 这是你自己的麻烦 - 你这是什么意思？
- You're your problem. - What's that supposed to mean?

531
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,834
我已经在这里帮你很长一段时间了
I have been here for you a long time.

532
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,702
台上 台下 还有这个物价上升 已经烦够了
In the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

533
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:09,867
我父亲投资所有的财产支持你的拳击 我们爱...
My father invested everything he had in your fight career. We loved...

534
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:16,213
他把你当成自己亲人来照顾 这里是他的家
He loved you like family. And this is his home.

535
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:19,681
我努力的维持住这个家 让他不要破碎！
I'm just trying not to let it die. That's my plan.

536
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,252
你呢？
What's yours?

537
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,796
你放弃了 是吧？
You're done, right?

538
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:40,738
你终于放弃了？因为我真的TMD确定 Charlie
You're finally done? Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

539
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,275
我什么都没有了
I got nothing left.

540
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,336
好吧
All right.

541
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,679
或许这里面还有点东西
Maybe there's something here.

542
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:55,821
昨天晚上小鬼带回来的机器人 你可以帮我看看吗？
This robot the kid brought in last night. Would you look at it for me?

543
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,381
拜托！
Please?

544
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:10,999
我从没有看过这一型的机器人 它应该是第二代的
I've never seen anything like it before. He's Generation Two, but barely.

545
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:15,769
我找到一个适合他的电池 然后我用旧型的G-2 无线连上他
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

546
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:18,003
你可以让他动起来 但是他还是垃圾
You can move him around, but he's crap.

547
00:43:18,112 --> 00:43:21,047
或许我可以安排几个拳击表演 赚个几千块
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.

548
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,342
住手
Stop.

549
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,144
这是我的机器人
It's my robot!

550
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:27,948
它花了我大半夜 辛苦的把它挖出来 他是我的
It took me half the night dragging him out of there. He's mine.

551
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:31,718
他是你的？但是用来修好他的零件是我的！
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts we're putting in him are mine!

552
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:36,292
你们二个白痴先不要吵 看看通电以后是什么样子
You idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.

553
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,864
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

554
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,217
小心一点 退后
Watch out. Stay back.

555
00:44:16,437 --> 00:44:19,804
看来它有一个映射功能 那是很罕见的
Looks like he's got a shadow function. That's pretty rare.

556
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,975
他可以模仿你的动作 记忆起来
He can mime your movements and store them in memory.

557
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,944
- 有没有什么是我们可以利用的？- 我看是没有
- Is there anything here we could use? - Not much.

558
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,104
哪里有个水桶...
There's a bucket...

559
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,475
有个我用来洗车的水桶
There's a bucket I use to wash the truck.

560
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,480
用来把它洗干净 它闻起来像大便
Use it and clean him up. He smells like crap.

561
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:36,483
也把你自己洗一洗 你闻起来也像大便
Wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.

562
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,953
我把它调到最基本的无线功能
I switched him to remote. It's pretty basic.

563
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,358
用绳子拴住他 带着他
Just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.

564
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,964
- 你玩电动游戏 是吧？- 当然
- You play video games, right? - Of course.

565
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:48,899
一样的概念 只是它是个一千磅的机器人
Same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.

566
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,460
酷
Cool.

567
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,269
"Atom"
"Atom."

568
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,016
他的名字叫“ATOM” 我们可以让他参加格斗吗？
His name is Atom. Can we get him a fight?

569
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:38,414
他不是战斗型的机器人
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.

570
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,546
他是第二代的 2014年建造的 用来表演拳击的
He's a G-2, built in early 2014. He was a sparring bot.

571
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,118
他们是建造来镜像...
They must have built robots like this one

572
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:46,283
其他战斗型的机器人
that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.

573
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:48,554
好的 我们可以让他参加格斗？
OK, so can we get him a fight?

574
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:51,353
你有没有在听？它是表演机器人
Are you not listening? He's a sparring bot.

575
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:54,161
它是可以承受很多撞击 但是承受不了真正的大力一击
Built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.

576
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,929
你可以当成零件卖掉它
You could always sell him off for parts.

577
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:59,403
- 我们可不可以让他参加格斗？- "你为什么要让他参加格斗？"
- Can't you get him a fight? - "Why can't you get him a fight?"

578
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,303
天啊 你就是不放弃是吧？
God, you don't quit, do you?

579
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:04,343
你要我帮他放到格斗场 格斗祭 然后害死他？
You want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

580
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:07,379
我看你在撞击宫殿里面是那么害怕
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.

581
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:11,645
可以让你参加格斗的地方会让你吓到尿裤子
The places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your pants.

582
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:14,216
好极了 带他去格斗
Excellent. Get him a fight.

583
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,351
顽固的孩子
Stubborn kid.

584
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:23,361
惊喜吗？
Surprise, surprise.

585
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:06,095
我们散散步
Let's take a walk.

586
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,200
你听得懂我说的吗？
Can you understand me?

587
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,315
别担心 我会保密的
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

588
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,176
你认识Charlie非常久了
You've known Charlie a long time.

589
00:48:56,216 --> 00:48:59,515
很久了 我们一起在健身房长大的
Too long. We both kind of grew up in this gym.

590
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:02,752
我父亲是他的教练
My dad, he trained him.

591
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:06,624
那是他们 那是Charlie
That's them. That's Charlie.

592
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,187
- 他是什么样子？- 当拳手的时候？
- What was he like? - As a boxer?

593
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,493
- 年轻的时候 - 他很不简单
- As anything. - He was something.

594
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,331
他很瘦 强硬
He was lean, tough.

595
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,337
永不放弃 不会恐惧
No quit, no fear.

596
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:25,769
来这里 我让你看看
Come here. I want to show you something.

597
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:31,645
给你看看2007年在凤凰城的报导
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007

598
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,518
当Charlie跟尼克康迪决战的时候 那是他的巅峰
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.

599
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,146
你也有看那场拳赛？
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

600
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:41,250
有的 Charlie本来只是热身的对手 应该是很容易被揍扁的
I was. Charlie was supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

601
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:44,660
尼克本来是应该连汗都不流一滴的
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat, but...

602
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:50,301
但是Charlie没那么想 他一步一步的逼近尼克
nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.

603
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,701
结果你知道吗？
Check this out.

604
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:55,867
这就是Charlie
That's Charlie.

605
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:00,474
一开始尼克不敢相信这个无名小卒会那么有胆识
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.

606
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,279
但是Charlie决不后退 尼克开始害怕了
But Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.

607
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,216
- 真的？- 是真的
- Really? - Really.

608
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,878
变成Charlie在玩弄尼克
He was toying with Nico.

609
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:11,680
这个世界排名第二名的拳手
The top contender, number two in the world,

610
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,851
Charlie像飞舞的蝴蝶玩弄着他
and Charlie was dancing with him.

611
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:18,689
Charlie整晚的脚步就像漂浮在拳击台上那么顺
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.

612
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,700
就像鬼魂一样 尼克根本看不到他
He was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.

613
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:24,501
我看得到
I could.

614
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:28,504
脚步是那么完美
He was beautiful.

615
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:30,873
就是那么完美
He was beautiful.

616
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,581
后来呢？Charlie击败尼克了？
So what happened? Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

617
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:40,449
不 尼克在第12回合揍扁了我 二次！
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.

618
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:42,419
第二次倒下 我被打晕了 再也站不起来！
Second time for good. Lights out.

619
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:43,819
当时计分板上 你是领先的！
You were ahead on the scorecards

620
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,251
- 一直到第12回合 - 结果第12回合 尼克击倒我
- going into the 12th round. - Nico Tandy rung my bell

621
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,260
后面三年他都是世界拳王
and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.

622
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:51,387
- 他击倒你？- 是的 还有很多人击倒我
- He knocked you out? - Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

623
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:52,795
你也击倒很多人啊！
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

624
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:57,359
- 24 场19胜 大概是这样 - 但是胜场都是击倒胜
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career. - But every fight a knockout.

625
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,870
- 是的 - 赢或输 没有平手
- Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over

626
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:00,639
- 直到一方倒下 - 直到一方倒下
- till someone's on the mat. - Till someone's on the mat.

627
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,265
- 你父亲教我的 - 没错 他教你的
- Your old man taught me that. - Damn straight he taught you that.

628
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,503
- 你还有跟谁比过？- 去收拾你的东西
- Who else did you fight? - Go get your stuff together.

629
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,546
我收好了 你有任何排名吗？
I don't need to. Did you fight for the title?

630
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,208
你还要再收拾！我们再一个小时就出发了 去收拾！
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

631
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,876
哇 还你！
Wow. Here.

632
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,347
你留着吧
Keep it.

633
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:20,185
- 谢谢！ - 不客气！
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

634
00:51:24,698 --> 00:51:26,495
我喜欢Max
I like that kid.

635
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,697
他也喜欢你
He likes you.

636
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:37,234
- 我昨天晚上说的... - 不 一切尽在不言中
- What I said yesterday was... - No, nothing more to say.

637
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:40,470
我今天晚上会到亚特兰大市
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

638
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,777
看看可不可以找到合伙人 募点钱 买个新的...
to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.

639
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:48,821
这是你想要的吧 ？我走？
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

640
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,427
是啊 这是我想要的
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

641
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:04,827
好的
OK.

“百丽来电”--拒接来电

644
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,000
赶快看
Look.

645
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:51,910
拳王在这里 宙斯在这里比赛
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

646
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,645
耶
Yeah.

647
00:52:55,689 --> 00:53:01,127
没有人能够跟这个怪兽打二个回合
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster. Two rounds!

648
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:04,489
拳王交出他的冠军腰带 准备保卫战
The champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.

649
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,589
可能他今天晚上会遇到一场真正的较量
He just may have a real fight on his hands.

650
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,002
最后 还是宙斯赢了 最强的终极格斗机器人 晚安！
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever. End of story. Good night!

651
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,467
- 太酷了 真是太酷了 - 你说什么？
- So cool. It's so cool. - What?

652
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:19,602
来吧
Come on.

653
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:24,574
听好 我要去找芬尼
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

654
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,481
你要乖乖呆在这一区
I want you to stay in this area.

655
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,622
不要挡路 拳王来了 让开路
Out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.

656
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:32,351
走开走开 拳王要过来了
Move, move. Champ coming through.

657
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:47,665
法拉兰蔻娃 宙斯是属于他父亲的
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father/daughter Zeus team.

658
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:51,437
大家说你父亲只是出钱 你才是宙斯的领导者
They say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.

659
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:53,435
你太客气了
You're very kind,

660
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:57,482
但是我要提醒你 松本先生才是宙斯真正的领导者！
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

661
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:02,085
是什么吸引了这个隐居的天才 这个天才神童
What did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

662
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,552
然后投入这个最重要的大赛的格斗机器人
and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport

663
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,092
为什么有办法让他再出山？
out of retirement?

664
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,519
为什么你不自己问问他？
Why don't you ask him yourself?

665
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:17,927
宙斯是不是松本先生最伟大的设计？
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

666
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:23,633
宙斯是不断的可以在战斗中自主学习型的机器人
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.

667
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,768
他有非常强的适应能力
With his adaptive operating system,

668
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:30,839
他可以随时的辨识对手的战斗模式 即时更新自己的模式
he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.

669
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:35,547
对于我及乔派克的理解 你是说宙斯......
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus?

670
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:39,921
我是说不管在场上发生什么事...
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring...

671
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:44,127
...结果都是一样的
the result of any fight is inevitable.

672
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:46,922
宙斯只会...
What Zeus sees...

673
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:49,798
...神挡杀神 鬼挡杀鬼！
he kills.

674
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:52,962
太好了
Sweet.

675
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:23,535
我绝对不会投资你的生意
I'm never going into business with you.

676
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:24,864
我只需要一点小帮助
I just need a break here.

677
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:27,735
你不是还有一台旧卡车 不是还有机器人在里面
You got that old bot truck out there. You always got something in there.

678
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:30,435
我有一个表演用的机器人 不值钱的
I got an old sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.

679
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:32,010
我现在还能怎么办？
What am I supposed to do with that?

680
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:34,876
带他到动物园 动物园明天有比赛
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo. They fight there tomorrow.

681
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:37,006
在动物园我只会被干掉
Even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.

682
00:55:37,117 --> 00:55:39,017
我只需要借一点钱
I just need a little loan.

683
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,680
什么？
What?

684
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:44,555
- Charlie 你是认真的吗？- 借一笔钱
- You're serious, Charlie? - A loan.

685
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:46,818
几百 几千 都可以 只要你愿意借
Couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.

686
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:49,453
我知道你有钱可以借给我
You know I'm good for it.

687
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:53,191
我很了解你 老兄 我很喜欢你的人
I know you, and as much as I like you, dude...

688
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,061
...只是 你实在是一个不会赌的人 兄弟
you're a bad bet, brother.

689
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:01,065
太好了 耶
Right, yeah.

690
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,652
你有没有看到？艾克洛德只剩下那一半...
Did you see that? That's what's left of Axelrod.

691
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:25,628
你跑去哪里了？不是告诉你不要乱跑
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

692
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:27,962
你应该要看看宙斯 太神奇了！
You should have seen him. Zeus was, like, amazing!

693
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,058
- 神奇 阿？- 不敢相信 耶
- Amazing, huh? - Unbelievable, yeah.

694
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:34,504
他接二连三的打击艾克洛德 很快的 太厉害了
He was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

695
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,065
艾克洛德一拳也没有打中宙斯 也撑不过一个回合
Axelrod didn't even land a punch. He didn't even survive the first round.

696
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:39,270
你以为拳击就是这样？
Is that what you think boxing is?

697
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:41,604
宙斯的比赛都是“安排”好的
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?

698
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:44,615
艾克洛德只是一块铁 拳赛已经变得是那么低劣了
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel. And that is what boxing is now.

699
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:47,185
你连这个都不知道 我喜爱这个比赛 而且我还是圈内人
Deal with it. And I love it, and I'm in it now.

700
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,513
你还在圈内？你跟你的旧第二代机器人？
You're in it now, are you? You and your G-2 sparring bot?

701
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:53,956
他很厉害的 帮我们安排比赛 你就会知道
He's more than that. If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

702
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,086
好的 你很幸运 有个地方叫做野兽园
You're in luck, kid. There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

703
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:58,960
明天下午 你可以参加格斗
Tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.

704
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:01,533
- 很好 - 然后我们就彻底完蛋了
- Great. - And it will be the end.

705
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:04,866
我告诉你我不喜欢汉堡
I told you I hate hamburgers!

706
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:09,868
是墨西哥卷饼啦
It's a burrito!

707
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,545
右上勾拳
Right uppercut.

708
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:24,920
左上勾拳
Left uppercut.

709
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,562
蹲低一点 举起你的双手
Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

710
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:37,794
再来一次 蹲下 举起你的双手
Again. Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.

711
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:40,134
你这样一整晚？
You been up all night?

712
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,764
是的 我把它清理了一下
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

713
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,174
我用动作映射功能教他一点格斗技 然后同步到遥控器里面
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.

714
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,714
是的 我看到你教他的双上击拳
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.

715
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:51,010
这是绝招
That's lethal stuff.

716
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:52,277
走吧 我们去格斗吧！
Let's do this.

717
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,578
吃早餐先吧
Let's do breakfast first.

718
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,793
你知道等下他就会被拆成碎片吧？
You know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?

719
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,089
等下你就知道
We'll see.

720
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,207
- 让我来！ - Charlie肯顿 这是马克思！
- Let me deal with this. - Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

721
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,140
首脑 叫我首脑
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

722
00:58:51,244 --> 00:58:53,838
- 好吧！首脑 那么... - 一回合我们可以赚多少钱呢？
- All right, Kingpin, so... - How much a round?

723
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,642
我们正在巡回比赛
We on a field trip?

724
00:58:57,817 --> 00:59:00,217
可以你可以跟我的机器人 Metro对打
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

725
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,117
二分钟 一回合 一百元
I'll give you a hundred bucks for one two-minute round.

726
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:03,654
- 接受它 - 三百
- Take it. - Three hundred.

727
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:07,248
一百元 小男孩 给你一百元是为了Metro练练
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

728
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:10,025
何不500元打二个回合？
How about 500 for two rounds?

729
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,696
二个回合？小鬼 你的机器人连一个回合都撑不过
Two rounds. Son, he ain't going to survive one round.

730
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,235
- 如果它可以呢？- 它没办法的
- What if he does? - He ain't.

731
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:19,962
让我们先假设它可以
Let's just say he does.

732
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:25,139
如果第一回合结束 他还能站着...
If he's still standing after one round...

733
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,840
...我就给你一千元
I'll give you a thousand bucks.

734
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,039
闭嘴！
Shut it!

735
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:36,385
但是如果他 我看是一定毁在那里 年轻人...
But if he dies in there, which he will, junior...

736
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,759
...剩下的零件都归我了
I get to keep what's left.

737
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,761
一百元的赌注就好...
Take the hundred.

738
00:59:44,263 --> 00:59:45,321
没问题
Deal.

739
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:48,996
成局了 比赛开始！
We're on. We on!

740
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,295
走吧！
Let's go!

741
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:55,772
- 你应该接收100元的赌注的 - 我帮我们争取更好的 1000元
- You should have taken the hundred. - I got us a thousand.

742
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,172
是啊 如果它赢得了
Yeah, if he wins.

743
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:24,435
你要我来操作吗？
You want me to drive?

744
01:00:24,737 --> 01:00:26,170
他是我的机器人 我自己操作！
He's my bot. I got this!

745
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:29,469
在这里的是真正的比赛 不是电动游戏
This ain't a video game. This is for real. Right here.

746
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:32,939
你不是说他会被拆碎？那谁操作有差吗？
You said he's coming home in pieces. What difference does it make?

747
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,206
好吧！随便你！
All right.

748
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:37,274
我来就好！
I got this.

749
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,783
开始吧 开始吧！
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

750
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,447
让我们像在香港打乒乓球那样修理他吧！
Let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

751
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,316
敲响铃声 敲铃吧！
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

752
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,896
不要看着Atom注意你的对手
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

753
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:03,237
注意他的脚 他要用脚钉住你
Watch out for that foot. He's looking to pin you.

754
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:07,205
我告诉你要小心那个踩脚的贱招数
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.

755
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,777
注意！大榔头要来了
Here comes the sledgehammer.

756
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:16,982
有没有看到？
Did you see that?

757
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:20,355
- 来吧！ 控制他！ - 不要吼他 控制好他
- Come on! Get him! - Don't yell at him, control him.

758
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,360
滑到右边 退后！
Slip right. Back step.

759
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:24,255
低头
Duck.

760
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:26,831
- 不客气 - 闭嘴！ 你在帮倒忙！
- You're welcome. - Shut up! You're not helping!

761
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,957
事实上 我认为我才对
Actually, I think I am.

762
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:34,203
后脑 你要快一点 移动快一点 屈膝
Backhand. You got speed on this guy. Just keep moving. Bob.

763
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:42,845
避开角落 不停移动 迂回前进
Slip out of that corner. Keep moving! Bob and weave!

764
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:46,979
就是这样！总算听懂我说的了
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

765
01:01:57,029 --> 01:02:00,226
你的机器人真能挨揍 我告诉你 你的机器人很耐打
He can take a hit. I'll give you this. Your bot can take a hit.

766
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,133
你最好避开那个锁头 这个会对你是个大麻烦
You better slip that headlock. This ain't gonna end well for you.

767
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:06,262
我在躲！
I'm trying!

768
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:15,206
剩30秒！
Thirty seconds!

769
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,346
30... 半分钟！
Thirty... Half a minute.

770
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:22,080
半分钟！ 不停移动！ 不要停下来！
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

That's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

773
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,889

785
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,371
全压 压他打不完第二回合！
Double or nothing he can't make another round.

786
01:03:16,475 --> 01:03:18,170

- Yeah, thanks anyway. - Deal. Double or nothing.

01:03:18,277 --> 01:03:20,609
小男孩说了！ 再来！ 开始咯！
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

788
01:03:20,913 --> 01:03:23,211
你疯了吗？你刚刚丢了1000元？
Are you crazy? You threw away a thousand bucks!

789
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:25,341
他只是勉强支持住
He can barely stand up in there.

790
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:28,147
我真的很需要这笔钱
Look. I really need the money.

791
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,489
我知道 我来处理！
I know. Let's work.

792
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:34,250
天啊！
Jesus.

793
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:42,025
- 小心！踩脚贱招！ - 我看到了！
- Watch that. Watch that. - I got that.

794
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:57,672
- 我控制住了 - 它的系统崩溃了
- I got it. - That's a system failure!

795
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:01,115
- 失控了！ - 他要倒下了！
- I don't got it. - He's going down.

796
01:04:05,124 --> 01:04:07,718
- 耶！ - 不！
- Yes! - No!

797
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:11,486
开始倒数！
Start the count!

798
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,996
开始倒数！
Start the count!

799
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,535

首脑 付钱吧！

807
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,022
好吧！好吧！好吧！我知道！我知道！
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.

808

- 我们赢了！ - 走吧！赶快走！
- We owned! - Let's go. Come on, come on.

809
01:04:49,735 --> 01:04:51,566
- 耶？- 我有没有帮你安排过比赛？
- Yeah? - Have I got a fight for you.

01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:56,267
一场比赛四千 如果赢了七千 周六晚上！
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand. Seven if he wins.

811
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:58,309
四千？没问题 我们走吧！
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

812
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,559
翻译：闲闲的猛男 校对：目前没有

813
01:05:07,586 --> 01:05:10,783
百丽 是我 Atom赢了
Bailey, it's me. He won.

814
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:14,185
你相信吗？小鬼的机器人真的赢了！
Can you believe that? The kid's robot actually won.

815
01:05:16,095 --> 01:05:17,289
我知道！
I know.

816
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:22,025
高兴吗？天啊！耶！
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

817
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:24,500
Atom被揍了 被揍的很惨！
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

818
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:29,331
但是...
Anyway...

819
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,340
我只是希望让你知道
I just wanted you to know.

820
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:09,213
刺拳 刺拳 勾拳！
Jab, jab, hook.

821
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,413
刺拳 刺拳 勾拳！
Jab, jab, hook.

822
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:19,119
我认为你还要移动你的双腿
I think you have to move your feet.

823
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:25,654
你的双腿
Your feet. Feet.

824
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:46,943
漂亮的动作 小鬼！
Nice moves, kid.

825
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,612
你整晚没有睡？
How long you been out here?

826
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,177
你看看！
Check it out.

827
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:55,583
我整晚没睡做了一件了不起的事
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.

828
01:07:55,688 --> 01:07:57,622
完全不可思议的事 然后搞定了
Incredibly amazing. If it works, you know?

829
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:00,687
- 你知道他的遥控器很脏了 - 是的
- You know his remote was spotty? - Yeah.

830
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:03,887
我丢掉了 不用了 我们不需要了！
I killed it. Got rid of it. We don't need it any more.

831
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:05,356
不会吧你？
How did you?

832
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,729
我想要重新再输入！
I had to start over.

833
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,529
所以我用突击者号的中心控制板
But I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush

834
01:08:10,636 --> 01:08:13,298
然后把大声公的声控板移过去
and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy,

835
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:14,463
成功了！
and it works.

836
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:17,667
他现在资料库空了 但是更好用了！
He knows nothing, but it works. It really, really works.

837
01:08:17,776 --> 01:08:18,868
什么更好用了？
What works?

838
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:21,776
让我打开给你看！
I got to turn it on.

839
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:25,883
左刺拳 右上钩拳！
Left jab, right uppercut!

840
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:28,977
日式！
Japan!

841
01:08:29,288 --> 01:08:31,756
你把大声公的声控模式移植到Atom身上？
You put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?

842
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:33,950
- 非常聪明 小鬼！ - 聪明？
- Pretty smart, kid. - Smart?

843
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,522
我是天才！
It could be genius!

844
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:38,392
那个是世界上最聪明的事
It could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!

845
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:41,523
不要那么兴奋 你把所有的汽水都喝完了？
Easy there, chief. Did you drink all these sodas?

846
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:44,694
我喝了一些 我需要你教Atom拳击
I might have had a few. I need you to teach him to box.

847
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:48,830
你不要开玩笑了？他没有那个级数去使出大声公的组合动作
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

848
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,239
所以他需要你的动作 你的组合
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

849
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:53,777
- 从脚步动作开始 - 别想了
- Start over from the ground up. - Forget it.

850
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,676
你曾经是一个拳击手
You were a boxer.

851
01:08:55,781 --> 01:09:00,377
昨天你在野兽园 可以清清楚楚的研判他们的动作
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.

852
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:02,716
我已经很久没有打拳了 也不想再打了！
I haven't boxed in a long time. I'm not starting now.

853
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:05,381
- 那谁来教它打拳？- 你就教的不错啊！
- Who's going to teach him to fight? - You're doing fine.

854
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:07,391
不需要我来教！对不起！
You don't need me. Sorry.

855
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:13,689
但是话说回来 那个舞步很酷
That was really cool, though, that dance.

856
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,797
我们周六晚上应该跳一下那个舞
You should do that on Saturday night.

857
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,697
- 不要取笑我 - 我是说真格的！
- Don't make fun of me. - I'm serious.

858
01:09:19,805 --> 01:09:22,638
在比赛前 在你们进入场地的时候 你们应该跳的1
Before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.

859
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,972
我才不想在拳击观众面前跳舞的
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.

860
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:29,475
不会吧你？这一切都只是场秀！
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

861
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,743
人们想看到一些从所未有的
People want to see something they've never seen.

862
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,546
你看 所有伟大的拳手！
Look. You think of all the greats.

863
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:37,451
像阿里 甜心雷 雷金王子 加玛...
Think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer,

864
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:39,353
他们都有他们的措号
they all had their nicknames.

865
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:42,484
他们都有天分 特质...
They had their personae. They all had flair.

866
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,998
你呢？虽然你的机器人不起眼 但是如果你会跳舞 这就是你的特质
Now you? You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.

867
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:50,564
而且 你是小孩 人们总是喜欢小孩玩意的
Plus, you're a kid. People love that kid thing.

868
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:53,467
- 你几岁？九岁？十岁？- 我十一岁了
- What are you? Like nine? Ten? - I'm 11.

869
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:55,335
你确定？
Are you sure you're 11?

870
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:58,572
是的 我确定我十一岁！
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

871
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:02,875
不管了 重点是人们想看到这个
Anyway, the point is people want to see that.

872
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,482
你不是故意搞我吧？
You're really not messing with me?

873
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:10,919
我没搞你 观众会喜欢这个的！
I am not messing with you. They're going to love it.

874
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,920
- 酷 - 但是...
- Cool. - But...

875
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:19,054
- 什么？- 你也要帮我
- What? - I won't do it unless you help me.

876
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,331
你要我一起跳 我不跳 你就不跳？
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

877
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:25,027
不是 是教拳击
No. Boxing.

878
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:26,634
- 噢 我懂了！ - 我来编程序
- Oh, I see. - I program the robot.

879
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,900
- 你来教他拳击 - 然后你跳舞
- You teach him to box. - And you dance.

880
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:30,498
然后你来跳舞！
And you dance.

881
01:10:32,745 --> 01:10:33,905
- 好吗？- 好！
- Yeah. - Yeah?

882
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,037
一言为定
Deal.

一言为定
Deal.

884
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,817
那样会很酷的
It's going to be cool.

885
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:39,074
很好
Nice.

886
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:43,813
你的对手都是比较高的 所以你要打高一点！
You're going to be punching guys bigger. You're going to have to punch up.

887
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,708
对了 就是这样！
That's it.

888
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:47,809
很好！
Nice.

889
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:54,857
你也是老骨头一把了？
You, too, old man?

890
01:11:55,928 --> 01:11:57,862
来吧！让我们好好锻炼！

第二个扣应 你有什么要分享的？
Caller two, what do you got for me?

905
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,979
你有没有听过一个小个头的机器人 叫做Atom的？
Have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?

906
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:03,111
噢 是的
Oh, yeah.

907
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:05,850
我们一群朋友昨天晚上有看到 他会跳舞
My buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.

908
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,926
- 你是说 "舞蹈"？- 是的 就是舞蹈
- Did you say "dances"? - You heard me.

909
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,153
他在比赛前都会跟个小男孩一起表演舞蹈
He dances pre-fight with this little kid,

910
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:11,820
观众都看疯了 乐疯了！
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

911
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,763
先不讨论哪些花招小玩意
You put the gimmick aside for a second,

912
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,335
我手里有份他打败的人的名单

Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack. No slouches on that list, right?

914
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,072
Atom把它们统统打败了
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

915
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:28,306
Atom很快 他躲过这些大家伙的绝招 不可思议是吧！
This bot is fast! He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!

916
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:31,606
不用怀疑 听众们一定会记得这个名字
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners, remember this name:

917

Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M. This bot is one to watch.

Heck, yeah.

926
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:14,315
这是不计名次的 但是还是职业级的
It's the undercard, but it's still a League fight.

927
01:15:15,294 --> 01:15:18,320
我要你放松一点 平常心
I just want you to be relaxed. I want you to be relaxed.

928
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,326

No freaking out. Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

929
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:23,828
如果你疑惑了 你会被修理的很惨
You go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.

930
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:27,804
不管怎么样 享受比赛 享受乐趣 不要紧张
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun. You got to have fun, you understand me?

931
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:31,933
我们来到这里已经很不容易的 祛场会搞砸一切的
We've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.

932
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,343
一切会很有趣的 千万不要祛场！
We're going to have fun, and we're going to not freak out!

933
01:15:35,647 --> 01:15:38,980
我们好好地放松心情 好好的修理对手一顿
We're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.

934
01:15:39,084 --> 01:15:42,349
这是我一辈子的梦想 我们将要参加...
I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...

935
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:47,019

Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

945
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:47,380
我知道你们今晚有一场重要的比赛 所以我就直接了当说了
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.

946
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,122
那个动作我喜欢 很漂亮的动作 所以... (Charlie已经语无伦次了）
It's a little far from the action for my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

947
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:55,159
漂亮的相片... 哇！非常漂亮
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

948
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,421

Look at that. You want an autograph? Would you mind?

949
01:16:57,729 --> 01:16:59,458
我想买你们的机器人
I'd like to buy your robot.

950
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,100
他对我们是一个很好的前场表演机器人 所以我愿意付你们
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus. And for that I'm willing to pay.

951
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:10,233
二十万
$200,000.

952
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:11,900
- 没问题 - 我不要卖
- Done. - He's not for sale.

953
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:14,740
- 当然要 我们绝对可以... - Atom是不卖的
- Of course he is. We can definitely... - He's not for sale.

954
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:20,341
你们还有十五分钟要对上双子星
You are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities,

955
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:22,386
一个邪恶的职业机器人
a vicious League bot.

956
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:27,925
所以我的报价在铃声前才有效
So, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.

957
01:17:28,026 --> 01:17:32,190
好的 但是让我再说一遍 不卖！
OK. And just to be clear, he's not for sale!

958
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:34,424
现在不卖 以后也不卖
Not now, not ever.

959
01:17:35,767 --> 01:17:37,928
给我一分钟想清楚 好吗！
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

960
01:17:38,437 --> 01:17:40,928
松本 你好吗？Max！！慢一点！
Tak, how are you? Max!

961
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,366
聪明一点 我知道你很喜欢他
Be smart. I know you love him,

962
01:17:45,477 --> 01:17:48,071
但是过二十分钟 它可能就毁了
but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.

963
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,274
- 考虑一下 接受吧！ - 你动动头脑想一下
- Think about it. Take the offer. - You think about it.

964
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:55,509
他们为什么要卖Atom？因为他是与众不同的
Why does she want Atom? Because he's different from other bots!

965
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,789
是啊 是不一样 是小个 虚弱的
Yeah, he's different. He's smaller, weaker,

966
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:00,016
- 而且他会被揍的很惨的 - 他是拳击手
- and he's going to get his ass kicked. - He's a boxer.

967
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:02,422
我们叫他拳击 你教他拳击
We taught him to box. You taught him to box!

968
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,129
- 这个就是它的价值 - 我也是这么认为
- That's worth something. - I think it is, too.

969
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:08,893
我想这个值20万 20万大元
I think it's worth 200 grand. Two hundred grand.

970
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,969
我们可以整晚都在这里兜
We can go round and round this all night long.

971
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,367
看着我
Look at me.

972
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,070
但是绝对不会卖的
But it's not going to happen.

973
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:18,506
对不起我还有比赛
I got a fight to get to.

974
01:18:33,158 --> 01:18:37,060
各位先生女士们 今晚...

Kicking off the evening, in our first undercard,

979
01:18:57,883 --> 01:19:00,613
二个头的暴君
the two-headed tyrant,

980
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:05,151
双子星
Twin Cities!

981
01:19:35,554 --> 01:19:40,890
对手是第一次参加职业比赛的
Opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight,

982
01:19:40,992 --> 01:19:44,450
让我们一起喊
hailing from parts unknown,

983
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:46,326
Atom
Atom!

984

- Did you switch him to fight mode? - Of course.

986
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:48,287
- 双子星是训练来撕裂对手 - Atom 也可以
- This bot is tough to put down. - Atom can do it.

987
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,287
看看那里 那二个握着摇杆在荧幕后面的怪胎
Look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

988
01:20:52,397 --> 01:20:54,194
他们完全控制他们的机器人
They're controlling everything their bot does.

989
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:55,459
他们随时监看它的系统
They're monitoring his systems,

990
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,161
随时调整他的战术
seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights.

991
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,329
这个不是以前我们对战的地下那种用遥控器的级别
This is not like the underground handheld remote bots

992
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,338
这是职业赛 你要了解到
we've been fighting. This is the League. Stand on that.

993
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,408
那我们要怎么做？
So what do we do?

994
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:08,668
我们要聪明一点 有耐心 然后祈祷
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

995
01:21:10,248 --> 01:21:12,045
正经一点 不是那种祈祷
Seriously, pray.

离开角落！ 移动！

He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!

He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1010
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,583

Right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1012
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:30,760
每次出右拳的时候 他都有一个准备动作
He's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb!

1013
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:33,223

Don't let him go. Right to the body! Straight right to the head!

1039
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:01,750
结束比赛 击倒！

1040

1048
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,220
我们从垃圾场来的的小巨人 击倒了职业级的机器人
Our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.

1049
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:41,622
爽不爽？
How about that?

1050
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:47,491
最后我要对一个背地里操作的女孩说...
And the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,

1051
01:24:47,599 --> 01:24:49,499
法罗 兰蔻娃
Farra Lemkova.

1052
01:24:53,805 --> 01:24:57,571
她想买我的机器人 用你们的钱来操作比赛
That instead of buying my robot, using your money to control this sport...

1053
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:59,506
- 就是她 - 不是我说的
- That's it! - I'm not done.

1054
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,239
你为什么不给小巨人一个最大的机会？
Why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?

1055
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:06,649
因为我敢打赌 你不敢给我们这个机会
Because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!

1056
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:08,343
大家想不想看小巨人
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

1057
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:10,478
对抗联盟冠军

1058
01:25:14,492 --> 01:25:17,928
我要挑战宙斯！

告诉我们 ！ 我们就来！
You name it! We will be there!

1061

我来为各位安排这场比赛
I'm going to get us that fight!

1062
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:43,811
Atom Atom Atom...
Atom, Atom, Atom...

1063
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:58,965
那是很没脑的举动 你就这样挑战宙斯？
That was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.

1064
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:00,635
那只是一时的冲动
That's one thing to call it.

1065
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:02,000
很多人会很想看的
A lot of people would like to see that.

1066

- All right, 70-30, right? - Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1070
01:26:12,517 --> 01:26:14,007
- 对对对 - 很好笑！
- That's so right. - That's very funny.

1071
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,380
- 我就说我们不应该卖掉它 - 喔 喔 喔！
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him. - OK. No, no, no.

1072
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:22,653
我想起来了 谁才对？说啊 说出来“Max是对的”？
I remember now. Who's right? Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1073
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,728
好啦好啦 你才是对的！
All right, all right. All right.

1074
01:26:24,829 --> 01:26:28,424
- 我们合作无间是吧 - 不是不是 要说“Max是对的”
- We're a good team. - No, no. Max is right.

1075
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,964
不敢相信 这么多钱 感谢你 双子星！
That was unbelievable. Thank you, Twin Cities.

1076
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,871

1077
01:26:34,973 --> 01:26:37,339
- 我们去庆祝了！ - Charlie男孩

1078

- Ricky, I was just going to call you. - Oh, yeah.

1079

I actually really was going to call you.

1080
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,513
没事 不用在意
Don't worry about that.

1081
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,643
真的是了不起的比赛！

- 来吧！兄弟 - 干嘛？
- Come on, man. - What?

1085
01:26:56,594 --> 01:27:00,724
- 你不会是说真的吧？- 你以为我在开玩笑？
- You serious? - You thought I was joking

1086
01:27:00,832 --> 01:27:02,629
我说“见你一次就海扁你一次”
when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?

1087
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:05,828
你以为我是开玩笑？告诉你 绝对不是！
He thought that was a joke. It wasn't a joke.

I got a kid here. And I have your money. We don't have a problem.

我看你也不敢
I'm sure you do,

1090
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:16,070
但是不只是因为钱是吧？你都知道的
but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?

1091
01:27:16,381 --> 01:27:21,546
好的 你要多少？二万 二万五 三万够不够？
All right. What do you want? You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

1092
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,416
- 我手头上有现金 - 是哦！对啊
- I got the money in cash here. - Yeah, right.

1093
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:26,649

Hey, Ricky.

1099
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:46,770
那是他的钱 跟他无关
That's his money! Leave him out of this!

1100
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,081

1102
01:28:04,962 --> 01:28:08,591
把所有的钱都拿走 全拿走！
Take all his money. Take it all.

1103
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:13,662
小朋友 你的朋友是个人渣
Your friend's a real dirt bag, kid.

1104
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:15,432
他是我父亲
He's my father!

1105
01:28:17,575 --> 01:28:22,410
看来可以少扁你一次了
Well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.

1106
01:28:22,513 --> 01:28:25,175
嗯 好好的给你上一课
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

1107
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:33,757
就像以前一样 Charlie男孩
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

1108
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:35,120
走吧 兄弟们
Let's go, boys.

1109
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:05,182
对不起 Max 我很抱歉
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1110
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,661
- 我们来这里做什么？- Max 只是...
- What are we doing here? - Max, just...

1111
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:50,859
来找法罗？她是不是打给你了？我们要跟宙斯比赛了？
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she? We're going to get the Zeus fight.

1112
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:55,132
不是宙斯 我想了很多 然后......
It's not the Zeus people. I've been thinking about all this, and...

1113
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:58,267
Max
Max!

1114
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,816
很高兴见到你
It's so good to see you.

1115
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:12,515
- 为什么她在这里？- 你最好还是现在跟她回去
- What is she doing here? - It's better if you go with her now.

1116
01:30:12,623 --> 01:30:14,682
我们被痛扁了 所以你打电话给她来接我？
We get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?

1117
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,692
他被打了 我就说他没法照顾好Max的！
He's been beat up. I told you he couldn't take care of him!

1118
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:19,592
是的 我打给他们 你看我们 真是一团糟
Yeah. I called her. Look at us. We're a mess.

1119
01:30:19,697 --> 01:30:21,722
我们很好 叫他们走
We're fine. She can leave!

1120
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,859
Atom打得很好 我们可以把钱再赚回来
Atom's fighting good. We can make the money back.

1121
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,570
Charlie 拜托！
Charlie, please.

1122
01:30:28,606 --> 01:30:29,698

Just...

1123
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,078

Please. Please.

1127
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,623
相信我 这样对你比较好 好吗？
Trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?

1128
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:58,133
你以为这样对我比较好 其实不是的
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.

1129
01:30:58,236 --> 01:30:59,897
你还年轻 你不懂
You're too young. You don't know.

1130
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:01,665
看着我 相信我！
Look at me, trust me.

1131
01:31:01,772 --> 01:31:05,003
而且法律上 她有你的监护权 我还能怎么做？
And legally she has custody, so what can I do?

1132
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:07,808
我还能做什么？
What can I do?

1133
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,755
我不要你的钱 马文
I don't want your money, Marvin.

1134
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:27,956
Max 我们有自己的游泳池哦
Max, we have our own swimming pool

1135

而且我们有按摩浴缸 还有很多好玩的玩具给你玩
and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.

1136
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,634
你要玩玩嘛？很好玩的哦
Do you want to play with them? It's going to be fun.

1137
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:37,830
情况如何？
What's going on?

1138
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:40,706
谢谢你 他根本不跟我讲话
He won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.

1139
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,179
我先到车子里面等
I'm going to wait in the car.

1140
01:31:45,883 --> 01:31:48,351
你不想讲话？好 我说
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

1141
01:31:48,653 --> 01:31:50,621
你要我说什么？我很抱歉？
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1142
01:31:50,721 --> 01:31:53,781
从一开始就是这样
You knew from day one what this was.

1143
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:55,756
从你开始决定上车就是这样
You decided to take the ride.

1144
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:00,128
你以为我可以跟你那个破烂堆捡到...
You thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap

1145
01:32:00,298 --> 01:32:02,789
的破机器人一起坐着看夕阳？
were going to ride off into the sunset?

1146
01:32:04,835 --> 01:32:07,235
你看错我了
No, you forgot who I was!

1147
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:14,801
你应该过的好一点的生活...
You deserve better...

1148
01:32:16,213 --> 01:32:17,305

Will you say something, please?

1150
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,222
我努力过了 你还要我怎么做？
I tried. What do you want from me?

1151
01:32:26,324 --> 01:32:28,087
我要你为我奋斗
I want you to fight for me.

1152
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:31,158
这就是我想要的
That's all I ever wanted.

1153
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:35,408

01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,355
最好的安排 马文及黛博拉他们有钱 会好好照顾Max
It's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

1157
01:34:46,464 --> 01:34:48,295
你有没有看到他看你的样子？
Did you not see the way he looked at you?

1158
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:51,799
就像我看我爹的样子
That's the way I looked at my dad.

1159
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:54,097
我多想再重温那种感觉
Even now I would give anything to have that back.

1160
01:34:54,205 --> 01:34:58,266
你父亲不一样 他从一开始就跟你在一起
Your dad was special. He was in your corner from day one.

1161
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:01,040
我 我早就搞砸了
Me, come on. I blew it.

1162
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,312
我搞砸了
I blew it.

1163
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,150
当Max出生的时候...
When Max was born I just...

1164
01:35:07,852 --> 01:35:09,251
...我吓傻了
freaked out.

1165
01:35:09,353 --> 01:35:11,548
你没有感到满足吗？
But something would have been better than nothing.

1166
01:35:11,856 --> 01:35:13,118
不对 是手足无措
I wouldn't know where to start.

1167
01:35:13,224 --> 01:35:14,248
- 我不满足 - 不 你很幸福
- Yeah, you do. - I don't.

1168
01:35:14,358 --> 01:35:15,985
- 你是的 - 不是
- You do. - No.

1169
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,053
你是的
You do.

1170
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,087
我要走了
I got to go.

1171
01:35:55,132 --> 01:35:56,599
开了1200英里就为了这个吻？
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

1172
01:35:58,202 --> 01:36:00,602
值得 值得！
Worth it. Worth it.

1173
01:36:12,049 --> 01:36:13,539
去找他 Charlie！
Go get him, Charlie.

1174
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,386
你说得好像你爹的口气
You sound like your dad.

1175
01:36:46,617 --> 01:36:50,451
我知道你认为我遗弃了你
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

1176
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:53,421
而且我还真的这样做了
and I guess I did originally.

1177
01:36:53,524 --> 01:36:54,548
你还卖掉我
Then you sold me.

1178
01:36:55,259 --> 01:36:56,385
Charlie？
Charlie.

1179
01:36:57,461 --> 01:36:59,429
这个地方一点都不欢迎你
You have no business being here.

1180
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,090
没错 你有全部的监护权 他是你的
That's true. You've got full custody. He's yours.

1181
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:06,135
而且我知道所有的事都是我的错 但是请你让我...
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...

1182
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,230
...我想要做一些补偿
I'd just like to do one thing right.

1183
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,268
好的
Right.

1184
01:37:15,946 --> 01:37:17,573
- 讲到哪里了？- 你卖掉我
- Where were we? - You sold me.

1185
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:19,979
哦 对了 耶 没错
Right, yeah, that happened.

1186
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,279
- 等一下 什么？- 然后我们被痛扁一顿
- Wait, what? - Then we had our asses kicked.

1187
01:37:22,386 --> 01:37:24,547
然后你还要睡在一个破卡车里面
And you slept on a shelf in a truck, and it was awful.

1188
01:37:24,655 --> 01:37:26,384
- 很危险 - 非常危险
- And dangerous. - Really dangerous.

1189
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:30,358
我知道 天啊 我真的很对不起你
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

1190
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:34,420
你来就是要说这个？就是要说你很抱歉？
That's why you came? To say you're sorry?

1191
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:37,022
不 不止这些
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

1192
01:37:40,037 --> 01:37:43,598
我来还要再说 我了解了
But no. No, I came to tell you that I heard you.

1193
01:37:44,575 --> 01:37:48,067
我懂了 虽然我有一点迟钝 但是我懂了
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1194
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:53,108
我知道我去流浪了 当你出生的时候
I know you had a bum ride, and I wasn't there and I should have been.

1195
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:55,409
我实在不应该去的
I should have been.

1196
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,144
你妈妈真的是...
Your mom was...

1197
01:37:58,656 --> 01:38:00,521
她很好是吧 很酷吧？
She was cool, wasn't she?

1198
01:38:02,092 --> 01:38:03,150
是的
She was.

1199
01:38:04,028 --> 01:38:05,325
她是最好的
She was the coolest.

1200
01:38:06,163 --> 01:38:08,688
耶 是的
Yeah, she was.

1201
01:38:11,568 --> 01:38:16,562
对她的事 我也很遗憾
And I'm sorry about... what happened with her.

1202
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,605
马克思 我没法让时间倒流
And I can't get those years back, Max,

1203
01:38:22,713 --> 01:38:26,012
但是现在我来了...
but I'm here right now...

1204
01:38:27,384 --> 01:38:30,649
...就像你看到的 我已经准备好要为你战斗
and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.

1205
01:38:44,601 --> 01:38:46,330
跟宙斯的比赛安排好了
We got the Zeus fight.

1206
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:47,597
真的？
What?

1207
01:38:47,705 --> 01:38:49,605
没错 安排好了
No, no, we didn't.

1208
01:38:50,507 --> 01:38:52,532
准备跟宙斯战斗
You got the Zeus fight.

1209
01:38:56,447 --> 01:38:58,381
黛博拉 可以请你通融吗？
So what do you say, Debra?

1210
01:38:58,482 --> 01:39:00,040
可不可以让我们在一起奋战 最后一次？
Can we do this one last thing?

1211
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,048
- 就一晚 - 我们就这个小小要求
- One night. - It's all we need. Thank you.

1212
01:39:11,095 --> 01:39:14,724
我们很可能被痛宰 但是至少我们在一起奋斗
We'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.

1213
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:17,726
耶？你怎么决定？
Yeah? What do you say?

1214
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:24,371
欢迎来到纽约的滨中心及观看钢铁擂台冠军大赛
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

1215
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:26,773
提姆 这是场我们不敢想象会安排的比赛
Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.

1216
01:39:27,077 --> 01:39:29,272
宙斯 永远不败的WRB拳王
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

1217
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,645
迎战最近新崛起的初级的Atom
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

1218
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,650
拳王的老板答应了这场比赛
The champ's handlers have agreed to fight

1219
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:37,414
打破了联盟循环赛的规则
outside the circle of well-known League bots,

1220
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:41,651
而且准备给观众一场真正的重量级的对抗
and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

1221
01:39:41,759 --> 01:39:45,286
提姆 告诉我 拳王是不是脑袋进水了？
Now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1222
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,159
有史以来最伟大的机器人格斗拳王
The greatest robot boxer of all time

1223
01:39:47,264 --> 01:39:50,256
为了跟一个第二代的 Atom 战斗而交出他的腰带？
gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?

1224
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:54,303
赫伯 如果你问松本先生 宙斯团队是不是疯了
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1225
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,669
他可能会用一贯冷酷的表情回你
Now, he may look cool as he enters the arena,

1226
01:39:56,774 --> 01:39:59,800
然后用轻蔑的表情看待这场比赛
but he has made no bones about his disdain for this match up.

1227
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:02,738
前几天我们的摄影机试着要补抓这号表情
Our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.

1228
01:40:02,846 --> 01:40:05,838
看看这个片段 松本先生甚至根本不想停下来跟媒体讲话
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

1229
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:09,313
好像这场比赛是是侮辱了他伟大的创造物
referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.

1230
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:13,288
Charlie Atom的教练做的已经不只是跳级挑战宙斯
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.

1231
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,618
还是公开的挑战
He did so publicly.

1232
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:18,422
这个挑战对拳王的公关形象是一个大挑战
The challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1233
01:40:18,529 --> 01:40:22,192
没有任何合约 但是我相信拳王的团队很清楚他们在做什么
No argument there. And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.

1234
01:40:22,299 --> 01:40:23,732
那就是他们做的 来吧
That they do. Come on.

1235
01:40:23,834 --> 01:40:26,860
给一个无名小卒一个机会来挑战
Giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.

1236
01:40:27,171 --> 01:40:30,265
那个垃圾厂的挑战者？这一切都只是噱头罢了
This "junkyard dog," if you will. That's a marketing stunt.

1237
01:40:30,374 --> 01:40:33,172
而且从观众的反应看起来 很奏效！
And judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.

1238
01:40:47,424 --> 01:40:48,789
我们赢不了 是吧？
We can't win, can we?

1239
01:40:49,827 --> 01:40:50,919
很难说
We'll see.

1240
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,494
挑战者正慢慢的走到他的角落
As the challenger makes his way into the arena,

1241
01:40:57,601 --> 01:40:59,796
你可以感受到激情的汹涌
you can hear the surge of excitement.

1242
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,614
Atom已经抵达WRB的比赛现场
Atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1243
01:41:14,718 --> 01:41:17,516
用他“像人类”的外观
using a style, some would call it human-like,

1244
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:20,215
他战斗的模式是非常少见的
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1245
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:22,519
Atom 跟他的迷你训练员已经踏上比赛场地
Atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring

1246
01:41:22,626 --> 01:41:25,493
看看法罗的表情 说明了一切
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

1247
01:41:25,596 --> 01:41:27,757
欢迎来到大联盟 年轻人
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1248
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:30,698
现在的赌盘开出来是1赔5 赌Atom撑不过第一回合
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.

1249
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:32,291
有人要赌吗？
Who wants some?

1250
01:41:32,936 --> 01:41:34,631
现在可以开始下注了
I'll take some of that action.

1251
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:37,901
嗨 我要下注
Hey, there! I'll take some of that action.

1252
01:41:39,243 --> 01:41:42,303
最近如何... 伙伴？
How's it going... partner?

1253
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:43,777
谁是你的伙伴？
Partner?

1254
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:47,511
很好 我下十万 怎么样？刺不刺激？
That's great. How about a hundred K? Is that funny?

1255
01:41:47,618 --> 01:41:50,280
十万？赌Atom 撑不过第一回合？
Hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.

1256
01:41:50,387 --> 01:41:52,218
你有带那么多现金？
You carrying around that kind of scratch?

1257
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,720
- 耶 - 十万？
- Yeah. - Hundred K?

1258
01:41:56,426 --> 01:42:00,658
记得 我在101区 C 排
Tell you what. Remember section 101, row C,

1259
01:42:00,764 --> 01:42:03,460
然后把我的钱拿过来
and you can bring me my money right to my seat.

1260
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:06,934
101 C排 ？十万 ？
101, row C? Hundred K?

1261
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:08,966
你听到的 “宅男”！
You heard me, homey.

1262
01:42:09,273 --> 01:42:10,934
-宅男 ？- 是的 ？
- Homey? - Right?

1263
01:42:11,241 --> 01:42:12,401
宅在家里的大男孩
Homeboy!

1264
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:15,909
没事 保镖们 酷！
All right. Peace out, posse.

1265
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:17,510
来吧甜心 我们走吧
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

1266
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:43,933
- 永远不败的 - 表演时间
- Never beaten. - It's showtime!

1267
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:46,334
永不恐惧的
Never threatened.

1268
01:42:46,443 --> 01:42:49,606
拳击场上的王者
The king of the ring,

1269
01:42:49,713 --> 01:42:51,840
机器人的统治者
the ruler of robots!

1270
01:42:53,016 --> 01:42:58,352
欢迎我们王者宙斯！
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

1271
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:25,005
哦！shit ！
Oh, shit!

1272
01:43:31,588 --> 01:43:32,885
好牛
That was awesome.

1273
01:43:39,563 --> 01:43:40,723
来吧 我们走
Come on, let's go.

1274
01:43:47,504 --> 01:43:50,064
各位先生女士们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1275
01:43:50,374 --> 01:43:52,899
在五回合的拳击规则下
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

1276
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:56,446
进行世界拳击冠军大赛
for the World Robot Boxing Championship,

1277
01:43:56,546 --> 01:44:01,074
在我右手边的是 挑战者Atom
in the corner to my right, the challenger, Atom!

1278
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,444
表现一下
Showboat!

1279
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:08,790
以及 在我左边的是...
And in the corner to my left,

1280
01:44:08,892 --> 01:44:11,918
整个宇宙最伟大的......
the undeniable champion of this universe

1281
01:44:12,029 --> 01:44:15,624
以及所有宇宙最厉害的...
and any other universe known or unknown,

1282
01:44:15,732 --> 01:44:19,964
宙斯王者
the mighty Zeus!

1283
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:28,739
现在 各位先生女士们准备好
And now, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready

1284
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:33,839
钢铁擂台
for Real Steel!

1285
01:44:36,787 --> 01:44:37,947
就是我们期待已久的！
This is what it's all about!

1286
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:42,048
铃声响起 马上开始比赛了
There's the starting bell and we are underway.

1287
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,088
机器人慢慢的离开他们的角落
The bots emerge from their corners.

1288
01:44:44,995 --> 01:44:48,055
宙斯一下就把Atom打趴 Atom已经倒下了
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

1289
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,491
站起来！
On your feet!

1290
01:44:49,599 --> 01:44:52,067
看来又是一出宙斯式的惨剧
Looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.

1291
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:56,938
裁判马特盖格已经出来开始倒数了
Referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.

1292
01:44:58,008 --> 01:44:59,066
站起来！

1293
01:45:00,744 --> 01:45:02,905
用手撑起来！站起来！
Push up! Stand up!

1294
01:45:03,947 --> 01:45:06,541
但是看看 小巨人已经站起来了
But look at this. The little bot's back on his feet

1295
01:45:06,650 --> 01:45:09,118
准备迎接宙斯的第二轮猛攻
to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!

1296
01:45:09,419 --> 01:45:12,411
不到十秒时间 Atom又一次倒下了
Atom is down for the second time in less than ten seconds.

1297
01:45:12,522 --> 01:45:16,481

站起来继续比赛

1301
01:45:27,637 --> 01:45:31,038
又一次 挑战者站了起来！
Once again, the challenger finds his feet!

1302
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:32,665
低头 后退！
Lean back!

1303
01:45:32,776 --> 01:45:35,074
Atom被连续击逼到了绳索边上
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!

1304
01:45:35,178 --> 01:45:37,544
- 离开角落！ - 移动！
- Get out of there! - Move!

1305
01:45:39,816 --> 01:45:41,875
一阵摧毁式的近身攻击
A demolishing inside shot.

1306
01:45:41,985 --> 01:45:43,111
把手举起来！
Get your hands up!

1307
01:45:45,122 --> 01:45:46,680
举起来！
Hands up!

1308
01:45:47,624 --> 01:45:49,057
揍扁那个罐头
Crush that little can!

1309
01:45:49,159 --> 01:45:50,649
离开角落
Get out of the corner!

1310
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:54,060
肯顿绝望的命令他的机器人离开死亡的角落
Kenton desperately trying to command his robot out of that suicide corner.

1311
01:45:59,002 --> 01:46:00,060
蹲低一点！
Get your feet under you!

1312
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:03,797
晚安 表演机器人！
Good night, sparring bot!

1313
01:46:03,907 --> 01:46:06,637
今晚只是时间长了一点 但是宙斯又一次要击倒了...
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!

1314
01:46:06,743 --> 01:46:10,076
Atom第三次倒下了 也可能是今晚最后一次倒下
Atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.

1315
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,546
- 站起来！ - 2！
- Stand up! - Two!

1316
01:46:12,649 --> 01:46:14,048
3！
Three!

1317
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:15,516
Atom 站起来！
Atom, get up!

1318
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,678
- 起来 Atom - 起来 Atom
- Get up, Atom. - Get up, Atom.

1320
01:46:21,158 --> 01:46:23,058
8！ 9！
Eight! Nine!

1321
01:46:24,094 --> 01:46:28,622
真不敢相信！似曾相识 小巨人又一次站了起来
I don't believe this! Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.

1322
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,892
来吧 Atom！
Come on, Atom!

1323
01:46:34,037 --> 01:46:35,197
它撑不下去的
He can't survive this!

1324
01:46:39,009 --> 01:46:41,204
- 来吧 Charlie！ - 右上勾拳
- Come on, Charlie! - Right uppercut!

1325
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,240
Atom 使出一记绝招！
Atom has landed a punch!

1326
01:46:45,549 --> 01:46:50,577
宙斯被出乎意料的上钩拳击中 摇晃的退后
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut that he never saw coming!

1327
01:46:50,687 --> 01:46:52,120
前进！
Advance!

1328
01:46:52,222 --> 01:46:53,712
退一步 出右拳！
Fade back, counter right!

1329
01:46:54,524 --> 01:46:55,684
退一步 出右拳！
Fade back, counter right!

1330
01:46:56,526 --> 01:47:00,963
右交叉拳！ 右交叉拳！ 右交叉拳！ 左勾拳！
Right cross! Right cross! Right cross! Left hook!

1331
01:47:01,064 --> 01:47:03,931
- 来吧！ 上吧！ - 击倒他！
- Let's go! Come on! - Take him down!

1332
01:47:04,601 --> 01:47:06,660
第一次 Atom占了优势
For the first time in his dominant run,

1333
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:10,638
宙斯第一次遇到一个打不退的对手
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!

1334
01:47:12,275 --> 01:47:15,108
群众已经疯狂了 宙斯使出浑身解数
The crowd is going nuts! Zeus gives it everything he's got

1335
01:47:15,212 --> 01:47:18,181
第一回合已经剩下15秒钟了
as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!

1336
01:47:18,281 --> 01:47:22,240
宙斯把Atom逼到角落 使出双组合拳
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!

1337
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:25,544
上击 下击！好像钟摆上上下下
Downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!

1338
01:47:25,655 --> 01:47:28,715
- 手举起来 下巴压低 - 蹲低一点 蹲低一点
- Hands up, chin down. - Stay low, stay low!

1339
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:37,292
只剩5秒钟 拳王使出了活塞式的组合拳
Only five seconds left, as here comes that piston-packed right of the champ!

1340
01:47:38,835 --> 01:47:42,999
铃声响起了 不敢相信 Atom竟然撑过了第一回合
There's the bell! I don't believe it. Somehow Atom has survived.

1341
01:47:43,106 --> 01:47:48,169
竟然进到了第二回合 观众都起鸡皮疙瘩了
We will have a second round. And the crowd here is thrilled!

1342
01:47:51,281 --> 01:47:54,614
他办到了！ 耶！ 回来角落！
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

1343
01:47:56,086 --> 01:47:59,920
我们要赶快离开这里 马上！
We got to get out of here. We got to get out of here now!

1344
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:05,024
走另外一边 快点！
We got to go this way. Come on!

1345
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,897
好吧 你坐下吧！
OK, you sit down.

1346
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:17,767
- 走吧 宅男 - 好啦
- Let's go, homey. - All right.

1347
01:48:17,874 --> 01:48:19,307
我一会就回来 宝贝
I'll be back for you, baby.

1348
01:48:20,277 --> 01:48:22,609
把你的手拿开 我自己走
Get your hands off me!

1349
01:48:25,015 --> 01:48:27,950
二个角落都在忙的检查他们的机器人
Both corners furiously working on their bots.

1350
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:31,384
观众们本来都预期今晚是个大屠杀
This crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre,

1351
01:48:31,688 --> 01:48:33,679
但是迎来的是一场势均力敌的战斗
but instead they're getting a war!

1352
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:35,121
- 你弄好了吗？- 耶
- You got it? - Yeah.

1353
01:48:35,225 --> 01:48:36,249
好样的 来吧！继续！
All right. Here we go.

1354
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:38,657
怎么搞的？
What is happening?

1355
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:43,756
他已经完全准备好应付任何突发状况 没有事的
He is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.

1356
01:48:43,867 --> 01:48:45,164
然后呢？
What next?

1357
01:48:46,036 --> 01:48:47,333
第二回合
Round two.

1358
01:48:55,645 --> 01:48:58,944
Atom 第二回合 Atom 不可思议的挑战者
Round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

1359
01:48:59,049 --> 01:49:01,074
勇敢的挑战拳王
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1360
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:06,414
宙斯揣着小巨人 把它像个罐子丢到绳边
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!

1361
01:49:10,193 --> 01:49:15,187
肯顿让他的机器人打出一个三连击 打在拳王的脸上！
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!

1362
01:49:20,236 --> 01:49:24,229
他们并列在战场 震耳欲聋的欢呼声
Toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!

1363
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:31,076
不管绳圈旁的教练想什么伎俩都没有用了
Whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!

1364
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:37,250
金属对战金属 钢铁大战钢铁
Metal bashing metal. Steel smashing steel.

1365
01:49:37,354 --> 01:49:39,754
这是一场大战
This is a brawl!

1366
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:47,262
观众已经都站起来了 拉长脖子看二个机器人残杀对方
The crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!

1367
01:49:47,364 --> 01:49:50,060
也即将要发生什么大事了
Something has to give, and it does!

1368
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:51,997
Atom 又一次倒下了
Atom goes down again!

1369
01:49:52,102 --> 01:49:56,232
今晚再一次次的点亮恶斗的战场
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!

1370
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:01,003
又一次 Atom又站起来了
And yet again, Atom rises up.

1371
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:05,707
肯顿逼不得已要跳线接上 才可以使机器人回到比赛
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!

1372
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:17,050
第四回合中段 拳王想马上击倒对手 结束比赛
Midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.

1373
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,494
拳王已经豁出一切 好像不打算回到更衣室了
The champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1374
01:50:31,775 --> 01:50:35,472
Atom在绳索边摇摇晃晃 他已经昏了！
Atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!

1375
01:50:35,779 --> 01:50:37,178
- 手举起来！ - 出了什么事？
- Hands up! - What's going on?

1376
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,215
我猜语音控制已经坏掉了 没有反应！
I think the voice recog is shot! He's not responding!

1377
01:50:43,453 --> 01:50:48,220
宙斯就像完美的暴力武器 钻进Atom的腹部
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

1378
01:50:48,324 --> 01:50:51,521
不！住手！帮一下手啊！
No! Stop! Do something!

1379
01:50:51,828 --> 01:50:52,852
他已经听不到了！
He can't hear me!

1380
01:50:54,197 --> 01:50:59,829
但是铃声又响起了 小机器人的表现已经震惊了整个世界
But the bell sounds, and once again this little robot has stunned the world!

1381
01:51:01,938 --> 01:51:06,341
我们完蛋了 Max 他听不到我的语音指挥了 这是谋杀 我们认输吧！
We're done, Max! He can't hear me. This is murder. We've had enough.

1382
01:51:06,443 --> 01:51:09,003
- 我把语音辨识关掉了 - 又怎样？他听不到我的声音了
- I'm disabling the voice recognition. - He can't hear me!

1383
01:51:09,112 --> 01:51:11,444
- 是的 但是他看得到你！ - 你说什么？
- Yes, but he can see you! - What?

1384
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,817
我切换到映射模式 你要教他怎么做
I'm putting him in shadow mode. Show him what to do.

1385
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,285
不用语音辨识模式 它可以移动的更快
Without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!

1386
01:51:18,388 --> 01:51:19,548
不行 不行！
No way. No way!

1387
01:51:19,856 --> 01:51:21,824
看看他们 他们已经被打晕了！
Look at them. They are freaking out!

1388
01:51:22,325 --> 01:51:24,384
那个有钱女孩已经抓着他指指点点了！
Rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!

1389
01:51:24,494 --> 01:51:26,519
你知道为什么吗？因为他们已经害怕了
Do you know why? Because they're scared.

1390
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,991
因为Atom可以做到其他机器人做不到的
Because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.

1391
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,964
- 但是我做不到 - 行的 你可以的
- But I can't do it! - Yes, you can.

1392
01:51:31,067 --> 01:51:33,865
- 我不行啦 - 不 你行的
- I can't. - Yes, you can.

1393
01:51:35,004 --> 01:51:38,462
让他知道怎么做 你必须自己战斗最后一个回合
Show him what to do. You have to fight the last round.

1394
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:40,140
不要拜托我 不要
Don't ask me. Don't.

1395
01:51:40,243 --> 01:51:44,839
Charlie... 拜托 我求你
Charlie... please. I beg you.

1396
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,980
你要用那个小狗眼神“杀”死我？
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1397
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:58,327
该死的！
Damn it!

1398
01:51:58,428 --> 01:51:59,486
耶！
Yes!

1399
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:01,888
真不敢相信我会这么做
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1400
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:05,332
我知道你能了解 不管你是不是听得到
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what,

1401
01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:06,868
但是我确定你了解
but I know you're in there!

1402
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,234
- 肯顿 打还是不打？- 打 给我一分钟
- Kenton. In or out? - In. Give me a minute.

1403
01:52:12,842 --> 01:52:17,404
我知道你听不见我说的 但是你可以看得到我 所以看着我
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!

1404
01:52:17,514 --> 01:52:20,176
仔细看着...我
Watch... me.

1405
01:52:20,283 --> 01:52:23,946
- 你知道你是对一个机器人讲话 - 我知道 闭嘴！
- You know you're talking to a robot. - I know. Shut up.

1406
01:52:25,054 --> 01:52:26,612
注意看着我
Watch me.

1407
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:29,081
这场如史诗般的大战已经
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

1408
01:52:29,192 --> 01:52:31,285
马上要进入第五回合 最后的一个回合
as the fifth and final round gets underway.

1409
01:52:31,394 --> 01:52:33,021
来吧 Atom！
Come on, Atom!

1410
01:52:42,539 --> 01:52:44,939
等一下 你有没有看到？
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

1411
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:48,169
Charlie肯顿正在场外映射指导回击
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

1412
01:52:48,278 --> 01:52:50,473
看来Atom有动作映射功能
It looks like Atom has a shadow function.

1413
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,447
所以基本上 Charlie肯顿就像是
So, basically, that means Charlie Kenton

1414
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:56,417
在最后一个回合自己上场对抗宙斯
is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.

1415
01:52:56,519 --> 01:53:01,115
但是看起来一点帮助都没有 Atom又被逼到了角落
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.

1416
01:53:03,159 --> 01:53:05,059
帮帮他！ 还击！
Help him! Fight back!

1417
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:06,253
还不到时候
Not yet.

1418
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:13,597
松本亲自监督宙斯的操作人员
Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down,

1419
01:53:13,903 --> 01:53:16,633
愤怒的想马上击倒Atom 结束比赛
furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.

1420
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,666
告诉各位大家 拳王看起来累了
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.

1421
01:53:20,977 --> 01:53:23,207
拳王看起来已经没力了
This robot seems to be running on empty.

1422
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,382
不敢相信！Atom在挑衅宙斯
I don't believe it. Atom is taunting Zeus.

1423
01:53:29,485 --> 01:53:33,114
- 切换到涡轮加速！ - 他认为还不够！
- Switch to turbo! - He's actually asking for more.

1424
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:36,615
拜托救救他！
Please do something!

1425
01:53:36,926 --> 01:53:39,156
- 还不到时候 - 对了 Charlie 还没到时候
- Not yet. - That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1426
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:43,296
现在使出活塞拳！
Nitrous pistons, now!

1427
01:53:46,436 --> 01:53:48,404
他已经没有办法再支持住了
He's not going to last much longer!

1428
01:53:48,504 --> 01:53:50,438
- 回击！ - 还不到时候
- Fight back! - Not yet.

1429
01:53:51,207 --> 01:53:52,469
坚持住！
Hang in there!

1430
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:58,036
Atom对宙斯的机关枪拳一点都没有办法招架
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1431
01:53:59,215 --> 01:54:03,049
Atom！ Atom！ Atom！ Atom！
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

1432
01:54:06,356 --> 01:54:08,483
等他没力 等他力竭！ 还没！
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

1433
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:13,187
宙斯慢下来了！
Zeus is slowing down!

1434
01:54:13,296 --> 01:54:16,163
拳王的动力已经接近报废了
The champ's power core is clearly depleted.

1435
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,324
Charlie 拜托！
Charlie, please!

1436
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:20,661
嗨 小鬼！
Hey, kid.

1437
01:54:21,537 --> 01:54:23,129
- 时候到了 - 现在！
- Now. - Now!

1438
01:54:28,411 --> 01:54:29,469
靠近他！
Get in there!

1439
01:54:32,048 --> 01:54:34,312
揍扁这个婊子 打的他开花！
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

1440
01:54:43,259 --> 01:54:44,624
耶！ 这就对了！
Yeah! That's right!

1441
01:54:46,195 --> 01:54:47,423
想想办法！！
Do something!

1442
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:49,356
走开！
Move!

1443
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:53,224
最高级别 切换到手动控制！
Override. Switching to manual.

1444
01:54:55,271 --> 01:55:00,106
松本吃惊的举动 他竟然亲手手动操作他的机器人
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!

1445
01:55:10,553 --> 01:55:13,249
- 攻击身体！ 靠近他！ - 打倒他 Atom！
- Work the body! Get inside him! - Get him, Atom!

1446
01:55:15,024 --> 01:55:19,518
大家看啊！拳王现在只能拼命的想办法站着
Look at this! The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet,

1447
01:55:19,629 --> 01:55:24,794
但是肯顿一点都不留情 一拳一拳的轰炸宙斯的身体！
but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!

1448
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,371
左！右！左！右！
Left! Right! Left! Right!

1449
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:14,644
Atom打出一记重要的上勾拳！ 宙斯倒下了！
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

1450
01:56:19,355 --> 01:56:22,518
这个小机器人今天晚上的顽强表现
This little bot has dug deep here tonight

1451
01:56:22,625 --> 01:56:25,355
深深的触动每一个人的心
and shown something damn near heart!

1452
01:56:25,461 --> 01:56:29,659
1 2 3......
One, two, three,

1453
01:56:29,766 --> 01:56:34,703
4 5 6 7......
four, five, six, seven...

1454
01:56:34,804 --> 01:56:35,828
宙斯站起来了！
He's good!

1455
01:56:36,139 --> 01:56:39,472
宙斯已经快站不住了 但是肯顿及...
Zeus gets to his feet, but Kenton has Atom on him again,

1456
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:41,338
...Atom没有放过他 拳如雨下！
landing punch after punch!

1457
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,810
松本跟他的超级机器人一点都没有办法回应
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.

1458
01:56:44,113 --> 01:56:47,207
宙斯夹住了Atom的左臂 但是肯顿一点都不惧怕
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!

1459
01:56:47,316 --> 01:56:50,285
局面竟然到了这个地步 各位！
It all comes down to this, folks!

1460
01:56:50,386 --> 01:56:52,286
甩开他 Charlie！ 就是现在！
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1461
01:56:52,388 --> 01:56:55,380
- 肯顿已经快把冠军... - 不 铃声响起来了
- Kenton is about to drop the champ... - No! There's the bell!

1462
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,621
铃声救了宙斯！！
Zeus is saved by the bell!

1463
01:57:05,535 --> 01:57:08,436
不可思议 比赛进入到裁判判决
Amazingly, we will go to the judges' cards!

1464
01:57:19,526 --> 01:57:20,686
去吧！

1465
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:25,884
各位先生女士们 经过了五个艰苦的回合以后
Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds,

1466
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:28,749

And Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46,

1470
01:57:47,276 --> 01:57:52,475
世界冠军成功的保住了他的冠军头衔
for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1471
01:57:52,582 --> 01:57:54,880
宙斯！
Zeus!

1472
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:04,486
法拉 兰蔻娃
Farra Lemkova,

1473
01:58:04,594 --> 01:58:06,892
的机器人今天晚上的表现比你们说的差多了
you got way more than you bargained for tonight.

1474
01:58:07,196 --> 01:58:10,563
有人说你的机器人赢了判决 但是输了比赛
Some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.

1475
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:12,596
她看起来很不爽
She looks pissed.

1476
01:58:13,302 --> 01:58:15,532
比赛过程比我们想象的还要久一点
It took a little longer than we thought,

1477
01:58:15,638 --> 01:58:18,835
但是结果还是如预期的一样
but the result is as expected.

1478
01:58:20,276 --> 01:58:24,645
我们赢了 宙斯还是永远不败的
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

1479
01:58:26,895 --> 01:58:28,895
松本先生 我想问的是...

1480
01:58:29,919 --> 01:58:33,252
对于你们今晚这场那么羞辱的比赛 被惨痛的修理...
Any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss

1481
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:34,618
...还差点输了 你有没有话要说？
your bot suffered tonight?

1482
01:58:37,627 --> 01:58:40,255
- 没说 - 不予置评
- Nothing. - No comment.

1483
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,694
Max Max在哪里？
Max. Where's Max?

1484
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:46,528
他在那里...Max！
There he is. Max.

1485
01:58:48,304 --> 01:58:51,705
大家都称你的机器人是“平民冠军"
They're already calling your bot "the people's champion."

1486
01:58:55,244 --> 01:58:57,007
你怎么说呢？
What do you say to that?

1487
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,470
平民冠军？
People's champion?

1488
01:59:01,918 --> 01:59:03,442
对我来说 很好！
Sounds pretty good to me.

1489
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,417
爹？爹！
Dad? Dad!

1490
01:59:15,398 --> 01:59:16,558
爹！
Dad!

1491
01:59:27,476 --> 01:59:29,000

1492
01:59:29,312 --> 01:59:31,371
不 你需要知道...
No, I need you to know.

1493

不用担心
Don't worry.

1494
01:59:35,718 --> 01:59:37,481
我会保密的
Your secret's safe with me.

1495
01:59:44,527 --> 01:59:46,290

Wait here. Wait here.

1496
02:00:30,973 --> 02:00:32,668

Yes!
