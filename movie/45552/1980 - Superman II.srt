...and not be able to talk to you?

1261
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:15,378
Not be able to show I
have any feelings for you?

1262
01:58:15,546 --> 01:58:19,341
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

1263
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:22,344
I don't even know what to call you.

1264
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:28,433
Lois, I don't know what to say.

1265
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:35,398
I don't know. Just say that you love me.

1266
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:24,322
Um… Gee, Lois, are you okay?
What happened?

1267
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:26,283
-I just got so dizzy.
-You all right?

1268
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:29,744
-I don't know.
-Get her some water, will you?

1269
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:32,455
That's what happens
when I don't have orange juice.

1270
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:36,084
-I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine!
-Breathe. Breathe, Lois.

1271
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:39,838
-I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
-Good for you. Good.

1272
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:42,090
-God.
-Just drink.

1273
01:59:42,258 --> 01:59:44,843
-Okay.
-Just sip it, sip it, sip it.

1274
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:46,845
-I'm fine.
-Boy…

1275
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:51,183
What was I talking about before?

1276
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:54,019
LEUEEN: If I know you, it was
probably about Superman.

1277
01:59:54,687 --> 01:59:56,938
-Him again?
-Clark, Clark.

1278
01:59:57,106 --> 02:00:00,650
You've gotta stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

1279
02:00:00,818 --> 02:00:03,278
Nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

1280
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:04,988
Well, I'll try to remember that.

1281
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:07,532
You better remember
that. I appreciate you.

1282
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,784
-You do?
-Sure.

1283
02:00:09,952 --> 02:00:12,621
-Especially if you get me a hamburger.
CLARK: Uh-huh.

1284
02:00:12,788 --> 02:00:16,124
A hamburger. At 9 a.m.?

1285
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:18,335
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

1286
02:00:18,502 --> 02:00:20,337
Everything on it.

1287
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:22,881
-Oh, and--
-Orange juice. Sure.

1288
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:24,966
Freshly squeezed. Okay.

1289
02:00:25,134 --> 02:00:27,010
Isn't he a nice guy?

1290
02:00:27,553 --> 02:00:31,306
Well, let's see what
trouble I can get into today.

1291
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:35,060
Leueen.

1292
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,895
What's happening in the world?

1293
02:00:39,815 --> 02:00:41,358
Leueen?

1294
02:00:52,828 --> 02:00:55,372
-Hey, Ron.
-Yeah?

1295
02:00:55,539 --> 02:00:57,332
Give me another
plate of this garbage.

1296
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,252
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1297
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:04,089
All right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1298
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:09,761
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1299
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:21,690
Excuse me, sir. I think
you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1300
02:01:21,857 --> 02:01:23,191
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1301
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:29,614
RON:
Now cool it, Rocky.

1302
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:31,908
Take it easy, will you?

1303
02:01:32,076 --> 02:01:35,537
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1304
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,550
[GRUNTS]

1305
02:01:52,096 --> 02:01:54,222
Oh, God!

1306
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:08,069
This order's to go.

1307
02:02:08,362 --> 02:02:10,780
[YELLS]

1308
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:19,664
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1309
02:02:22,084 --> 02:02:25,962
Oh, I've been, uh, working out.

1310
02:02:49,653 --> 02:02:51,613
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1311
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:54,324
Sorry I've been away so long.

1312
02:02:55,117 --> 02:02:57,535
I won't let you down again.
