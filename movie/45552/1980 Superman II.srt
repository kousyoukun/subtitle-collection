1
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,374
Alert! Alert! Alert!

2
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,873
You three criminals have been caught...

3
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,204
...in a further act of seditious treason.

4
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:05,078
General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.

5
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,540
Your only desire was to command.

6
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:13,125
Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.

7
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,803
Your only wish, to rule at his side.

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,140
Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.

9
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,153
This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you all--

10
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:36,947
Guilty.

11
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,770
You will lie down before me, Jor-El.

12
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,943
Both you, and then one day, your heir!

13
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,313
Your heir!

14
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,186
- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks a--

15
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,780
Sorry, after you.

16
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,822
Yeah, thanks a lot.

17
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,950
- Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

18
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,285
Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty
blouse you're wearing today.

19
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,538
I'll catch you later, Clark.

20
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,380
Hello?

21
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,130
I don't know. Okay. Yep.

22
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,128
- Morning, Leueen. How's it--?
- Okay. I'll check it.

23
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,558
Mr. White, how long should
we hold the front page?

24
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,392
Give it another 10 minutes,
and-- Oh, I'll tell them.

25
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,309
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Hello, Pete.

26
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,557
If we don't get anything
new in 10 minutes...

27
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,733
...go with the wire-service copy and
run the picture in three columns.

28
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,240
I need a story for the page-three
sidebar on this terrorist group.

29
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,065
Right.

30
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,994
Sorry, terrorists?

31
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,906
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent.
Where you been?

32
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,249
- I was at home.
- Don't you watch television?

33
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,535
I don't enjoy television.
Too much violence.

34
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,999
I was just reading Dickens.

35
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,418
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

36
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,589
He knows where the
Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.

37
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,217
- You do, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,184
- Has anybody been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

39
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,755
- The hostages?
- Yeah, tourists. About 20 of them.

40
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,601
But that's just penny-ante stuff.

41
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,596
They claim if the government
doesn't meet their demands...

42
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,443
...they've got a hydrogen bomb.

43
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,863
Mr. White, that's terrible.

44
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,777
That's why they call
them terrorists, Kent.

45
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,238
Now, get to the morgue. I wanna
know everything on terrorism.

46
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,525
Mr. White, does Lois
know about any of this?

47
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,119
- Does she know about it? She's in it.
- She's what?

48
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,285
The minute the story broke, I
bundled her on the first Concorde.

49
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,415
If Paris is gonna go kablooey,
I want my best reporter there.

50
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,213
- But, gee, Mr. White--
- You're good, but Lois Lane is better.

51
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,958
No, I meant, isn't that a
little bit dangerous, sir?

52
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,381
That goes with the territory, Kent.

53
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,720
Don't worry.

54
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,635
If I know Lois Lane, she'll not only
come back with a Pulitzer Prize story...

55
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,309
...but a one-on-one interview
with a hydrogen bomb...

56
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,555
...titled "What Makes Me Tick."

57
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,267
Now, don't stand around, Kent--

58
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,355
- How did they get up there?
- They were disguised as repair workers.

59
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,034
Can you tell us why they
released the first hostages?

60
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,193
We insist they do this
to show good faith.

61
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,105
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

62
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,490
Will they release the
rest of the hostages?

63
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,828
In return for a guarantee that we
will not launch an attack on them.

64
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,214
There will be no attack, no attempt
to overpower the terrorists?

65
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,035
- We've made a guarantee.
- And you'll honor it?

66
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,039
We have not the choice to refuse...

67
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,711
...if we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

68
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,344
- Where is the bomb?
- It's in a big oilcan.

69
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,548
Hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

70
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,020
How can we be sure? Today it's
possible for anyone to make a bomb.

71
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,443
This could blow up all of Paris.

72
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,562
What's the government's position?
Will they meet their demands?

73
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,071
I am not authorized to
say what they will do.

74
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,153
At this moment, there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysee Palace.

75
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,251
Wait. Wait, wait.

76
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,383
- Stairs. Stairs? Stairs.
- Stairs.

77
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,182
Okay?

78
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,116
- All right. We'll bring them down now.
- Get in.

79
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,456
- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we look like the sort of--?

80
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:15,383
I don't know what you look like. Get in.
You're being released. Shut up.

81
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,294
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, ready.

82
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,591
This way.

83
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,335
- Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
- Hurry up.

84
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,264
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

85
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,099
I'll take a last look around.

86
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,324
Okay, send them down.

87
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,985
Okay, up we go.

88
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,002
Pulitzer Prize.

89
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,714
Capital P-- Darn.

90
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,478
Should we have let the hostages go?

91
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,233
They'll give in to us as
soon as we plant the bomb.

92
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,146
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

93
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,151
Nobel Prize.

94
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,700
Capital N...

95
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,993
...little O, little B...

96
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,827
...little E, little L.

97
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,753
Nobel. Nobel. Nobel.

98
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,918
Prize.

99
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,052
Now, be careful.

100
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,718
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

101
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,429
I hope you have not many
sins left to be forgiven...

102
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,900
...because if you let go of that, you'll
only have 60 seconds to list them.

103
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,034
- You are right.
- Did you hear something?

104
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,243
Sounded like someone moving underneath.

105
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,823
It's your nerves.

106
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,290
- Where are they now?
- They are near to the lift.

107
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,423
But one is still inside with the bomb.

108
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,295
The third one has come
out of the lift now.

109
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,585
- The third one is out now.
- The bomb, is it still in there?

110
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,090
Yes, we think so.

111
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,266
This is the boring bit.

112
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,498
Tell them to get ready.

113
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,877
Stand by.

114
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,591
Get ready. Come on.

115
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,013
We'll cut the cable as
soon as we get the word.

116
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,260
Are you sure they haven't
primed the bomb?

117
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,101
No, no, of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

118
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,283
Now!

119
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,541
- It started.
- Oh, my God.

120
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,082
I believe this is your floor.

121
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,202
Oh, thank God.

122
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,253
How did I get myself into this?

123
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,331
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

124
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,339
A bomb! There's a bomb up there.

125
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,705
- They've got a bomb.
- I know. I know.

126
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,348
Nice fresh melons. Nice fresh melons.
Get them fresh here.

127
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,425
Good for the cooking, huh?
Look at this, the best.

128
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,613
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

129
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,032
Hey!

130
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,117
Clark.

131
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,331
- You ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...

132
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,461
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

133
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,126
Freak.

134
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,053
Clark, you know, you were
really lucky that time.

135
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,390
You gotta be careful. When you
cross the street, look both ways.

136
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,476
Well, I mean, gee, Lois,
usually I do, you know.

137
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,571
- Come in.
- Hi.

138
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,823
You know, maybe you ought to
get your glasses checked.

139
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:46,699
Uh, well, you know, not everybody can
have x-ray vision, you know, Lois.

140
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,406
Do I detect a note of
jealousy in that voice?

141
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,672
Jealousy? No, no. Not me.

142
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,261
Golly, Lois, what are you doing?

143
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,093
When was the last time
you heard me sneeze?

144
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,890
You are never gonna hear me sneeze again.

145
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,604
- No?
- No. I read this book...

146
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,274
...and it says that if you get 1000
milligrams of vitamin C every day...

147
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,939
...you stay in perfect health.

148
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,274
Golly, 1000? That's certainly a
lot of oranges, isn't it, Lois?

149
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,110
- There are pills. I've seen them.
- Pills.

150
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,437
That's the modern way to do things.

151
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,362
This is natural.

152
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,242
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

153
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,040
And, Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

154
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,380
- Uh, I don't?
- No, you got so much going for you.

155
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,583
I do?

156
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,462
Do you mind if I give you a
little constructive criticism?

157
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,300
- Well, actually, yes, I--
- You gotta be more aggressive.

158
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,470
You have to go from the instinct.

159
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,095
You see something, you
want it, you go for it.

160
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,643
That's what I do.

161
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,976
Yes, I've noticed. Perhaps
I could help you there.

162
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,983
Oh, thanks. That would be great.

163
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,395
Let me see now...

164
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,146
Oh, I see.

165
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,566
Just put the orange in there.
That's really very clever.

166
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,488
Clark.

167
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,450
You know that I wouldn't say ail those
things to you if I didn't really care.

168
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,828
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

169
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,672
I mean, what else are friends for?

170
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,297
- Friends, huh?
- Mm-hm.

171
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,591
Here, Clark.

172
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,506
Here's to friendship.

173
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,103
Hm.

174
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,702
This is how it ends for the
greatest criminal mind of our time.

175
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,172
Not with a whimper, not with a bang.

176
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,883
How do they choose to
reward Lex Luthor...

177
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,964
...the greatest genius in this world?

178
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:05,049
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

179
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,297
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

180
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,232
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

181
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,225
I mean, California almost fell
down, right in the ocean.

182
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,228
Millions of people was almost killed.

183
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,570
If it hadn't been for that guy
Superman, that overgrown Boy Scout.

184
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,986
- I want my Liberace record back tonight.
- There's a scratch on it.

185
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,866
What are you gonna do
with a guy like that?

186
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,243
He flies around so fast and everything.

187
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,416
I mean, they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

188
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,576
Every time they try, he just flies off.

189
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,092
- Where?
- North.

190
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,094
Why?

191
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,546
To ski?

192
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,085
Otis, every man has his vulnerable point.

193
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,511
Some, like you, Otis, have more than one.

194
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,601
I didn't see Superman's in time.

195
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,436
But now, through patience,
invention, and skill...

196
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,568
...my little black box
is just about ready.

197
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,942
- Oh, that little black box in our cell?
- Shh!

198
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,027
That little black box, Mr. Luthor...

199
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,621
...what's it for?

200
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:20,366
That little black box, Otis, goes
beyond any conventional radar.

201
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,422
- It tracks alpha waves.
- Oh.

202
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,260
Alpha waves. Hm.

203
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:38,388
Those alpha waves will take
me north to his secret.

204
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,269
And his secret will give me Superman.

205
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,777
The MAB is 196 at 0.5.

206
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,235
We ought to see the old beauty
when we top the rise there.

207
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,411
Follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

208
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,659
Anyway, somebody's gotta
check up on those guys.

209
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,672
Yeah, I keep on forgetting about them.

210
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,625
How long they been up there, 45 days?

211
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,756
The whole world's forgotten about it.

212
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,138
Houston calling Artemis ll.

213
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,770
Houston calling Artemis ll. Come in.

214
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,523
- Morning, Houston.
- Hold on, Nate.

215
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,595
- Yo.
- How are things going?

216
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,855
Ail systems normal, Houston.

217
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,944
- Andy is out doing the geological survey.
- Okay.

218
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,360
More rocks. Nice.

219
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,660
And cosmonaut Boris is
getting some soil samples.

220
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,374
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

221
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,039
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

222
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,496
Just a little detente
humor there, Houston.

223
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,667
Surface conditions unchanged?

224
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,875
Well, it's mighty pretty out there.
Mighty...

225
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,047
- ...pretty.
- Mighty pretty.

226
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,391
Right.

227
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,644
Look, Nate?

228
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,386
Nate, wake up, will you?

229
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,138
That's it. I'm dreaming.

230
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,560
Artemis, come in.

231
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,863
Well, Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

232
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,395
Unidentified?

233
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,739
- What does it look like?
- Well...

234
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,565
...a lot like a girl.

235
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,719
You.

236
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,932
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

237
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,849
A man?

238
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,001
What a fragile sort of life form this is.

239
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,201
Houston, come in. Come in, Houston.

240
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,172
Come in, Houston. Come in.

241
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,955
Attempting manual liftoff.

242
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,340
Can somebody hear me?

243
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,720
Houston!

244
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,511
Come in, Houston!

245
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,814
Oh, no. No!

246
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,231
Somebody help me!

247
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,895
- Artemis, this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

248
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,071
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in.
- What's going on?

249
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,201
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

250
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,079
Well, we really--

251
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,873
Artemis, come in, please.
Houston calling.

252
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,751
What was that he said before?
He saw a girl?

253
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,594
- I thought he said "curl."
- What's a curl?

254
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,758
Isn't that what the old Canaveral
guys used to call a comet...

255
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,427
...with an east-west trajectory?

256
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,516
How should I know? I was back
in high school in those days.

257
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:33,523
Strange. I tore those
metal fibers like paper.

258
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,608
And what he did was amazing.

259
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:42,236
- Something is happening.
- Yes, to all of us.

260
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,619
The closer we come to an
atmosphere with only one sun...

261
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,617
...a yellow sun...

262
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,789
...the more our molecular density
gives us unlimited powers.

263
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,749
They come from there.

264
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
A place called Houston.

265
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,468
Then we will go there too...

266
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,593
...to rule.

267
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,722
Finally, to rule.

268
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,826
Three-eighty, out.

269
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,914
Three-eighty-one, out.

270
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,834
Three-eighty-two, out.

271
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,671
Three-eighty-three, out.

272
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,669
Three-eighty-four, out.

273
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,973
Three-eighty-five, out.

274
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,009
Lights out, Luthor.

275
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,808
I said, lights out.

276
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:59,111
You guys are about 10 seconds away
from solitary, you know that?

277
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,282
I told you to--

278
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,674
Freeze, freeze.

279
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,481
Go out there and find it.

280
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:43,648
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

281
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,372
I think I found it.

282
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,707
What is it?

283
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,513
It's a ladder, you dummy.

284
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,678
- Hi, Miss Teschmacher.
- Sh!

285
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,770
Come on.

286
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,776
Hurry up. Hurry up.

287
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,954
Come on, hurry.

288
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,028
Otis, hold that ladder. Hurry up.

289
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:37,041
--50-yard line, touchdown!
Oh, what a beautiful play.

290
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,955
But there's a marker downfield.
It could be against--

291
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,553
- Come up.
- Come on.

292
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,304
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

293
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,264
- Get off. Get off.
- Otis!

294
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,721
- We're sinking!
- Get off, get off!

295
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,098
Excuse me.

296
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,861
If you'd like to carry Mrs.
Smith over the threshold...

297
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,777
it's sort of traditional.

298
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,775
I can give you a hand if
you have trouble lifting.

299
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,528
- No, of course not.
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.

300
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,655
Certainly, dear.

301
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:05,038
- Well, here you are.
- Well, sure is pink.

302
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,879
Careful with the bags, please, sir.

303
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,205
Is this your first visit
to Honeymoon Haven?

304
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,176
- Together, anyway.
- Yes.

305
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,722
Let me just show you some
of our special features.

306
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:20,137
These are our Flames of Love, exclusive
with this motel in the area.

307
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,308
If you want the flames to go
higher, you just pull this.

308
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,638
Oh, I see.

309
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,822
- Look, dear. That's kind of romantic.
- In July?

310
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,492
- Honey?
- For a nominal charge...

311
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,152
...our staff photographer
will be happy to prepare...

312
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,912
...a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

313
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,405
He'll photograph you in some of
our more intimate locations...

314
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,708
...in the tub for two,
on the bearskin rug.

315
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,583
Gee, real polyester!

316
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,003
And here's the bed.

317
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,839
Right. Thank you.

318
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,924
Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,553
Oh, of course. Um...

320
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,601
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,563
And have a happy...

322
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,393
...whatever.

323
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,771
Ugh! Can you believe this?

324
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,109
Posing as newlyweds to expose a
honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.

325
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,610
- Well...
- What a waste of a great writer.

326
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Writers.

327
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,699
Perry White and his
Sunday magazine exposes.

328
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,118
How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer
Prize writing about a pink bear?

329
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,118
I don't know, I think this kind
of thing should be exposed.

330
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,631
They get kids who are just starting
out, and take them for every cent.

331
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,455
- That's what Mr. White says.
- Yeah?

332
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,881
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
Complimentary champagne.

333
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,102
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

334
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,973
Lois, would...? Uh...

335
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,810
No.

336
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,475
Hey, look at this.

337
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,443
Lois? Gee.

338
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,398
Look what I found. A
complimentary corsage.

339
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,277
Yeah, everything's complimentary
around here till you get the bill.

340
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,494
Yeah.

341
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,494
Gee, you look very pretty.

342
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,239
Thank you, Clark.

343
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,002
Sure.

344
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,584
You know, Lois, um, I
was sort of thinking...

345
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,750
Well, later on-- Well, I--

346
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:16,419
I was wondering what you wanted
to do about the arrangements.

347
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,341
What arrangements, Clark?

348
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:24,349
Well, um, I was thinking
primarily about the, um...

349
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,465
...sleeping arrangements.

350
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,598
- Mr. Smith?
- Uh-huh.

351
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,268
- The complimentary couch.
- Right.

352
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,818
What? Oooh.

353
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,321
Gosh, it's alive.

354
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,827
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good.

355
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,168
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

356
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,714
Miss Teschmacher, is this
a philosophy seminar?

357
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,546
No. This is a getaway.

358
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,005
- Getaway.
- Right.

359
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,885
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

360
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,223
What else is ballast for?

361
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,812
Miss Teschmacher...

362
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:10,307
...north. Due north.

363
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,806
Right. North.

364
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:36,253
- Where's Jimmy when I need him?
- Golly, isn't it beautiful?

365
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,260
Yes, gorgeous. Gorgeous.

366
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,757
- Lois?
- Yeah?

367
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:45,755
Look. Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands too, huh?

368
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,020
- Here's my hand, Clark. Hold it.
- Thanks.

369
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,440
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

370
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,523
- Why?
- They let go, straight to the lawyer.

371
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,570
Oh, I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

372
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,114
That's because you're blind, Clark.

373
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,112
- Oh, yeah.
- Here.

374
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,201
- No, I've got it. No, I--
- Yeah. Clark.

375
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,616
You've gotta look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

376
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,246
- God.
- Lois?

377
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,583
- Now, here.
- Right.

378
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,617
- Don't say I never did anything for you.
- Thank you.

379
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,706
Son! Excuse me, please.

380
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,587
- Be careful.
- What are you doing?

381
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,587
Get down! Get down!

382
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,762
You embarrass me here
in front of everybody.

383
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,653
Lois, did you see what almost happened there?
That little boy--

384
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Hey, I'm hungry. You hungry?

385
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,990
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Why, because I'm hungry?

386
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,993
No. Here you are standing in front of one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

387
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,157
...and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

388
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,747
Clark, once a girl's seen
Superman in action...

389
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,423
...Niagara Falls kind of
leaves you cold, you know?

390
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,333
Him again, huh?

391
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,839
Oh, I'm sorry.

392
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,337
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

393
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,676
Well, my one-track mind is
telling me that I'm hungry.

394
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,973
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

395
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,506
Hot dog.

396
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,259
Could I have some orange juice?

397
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,601
- Freshly squeezed.
- Freshly squeezed, I know. Okay.

398
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,815
Hey, Mom. Look!

399
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,994
Yeah, honey. That's nice.

400
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,032
Okay, it's two mustard and relish, and...

401
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,496
Oh, my God!

402
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,134
Help!

403
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,545
Somebody help!

404
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,335
Somebody do something!

405
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,356
Way to go, Superman!

406
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,243
What a nice man. Of course he's Jewish.

407
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,167
- There you go.
- Again, again!

408
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,588
No, I'm sorry. Only one
ride to a customer.

409
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,718
Superman. Superman, it's me, Lois!

410
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,097
Come here. You're gonna get it!

411
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,765
- Give me a heart attack here.
- It's me. It's Lois.

412
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,015
Lois Lane.

413
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,234
Well, hello and goodbye.

414
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,569
What's the hurry? I mean, seeing as
you happen to be in Niagara Falls?

415
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,356
Happen to be in Niagara Falls.

416
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,619
And Clark...

417
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,285
Clark is not around, as usual.

418
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,120
Hmm.

419
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,390
Lois?

420
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,313
Hey, Lois?

421
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,635
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

422
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,650
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

423
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,573
Well, it just seems kind of strange to
me that every time Superman's around...

424
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,614
...you disappear.

425
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,987
Superman? You mean he was here?

426
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,775
- Golly.
- And you weren't. As usual.

427
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,163
So, what have you got to say about that?

428
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,289
Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

429
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,246
Clark.

430
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,751
No orange juice?

431
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,799
Mush! Mush!

432
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,022
I am mushing.

433
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,193
Ice and snow. Is this
your idea of a good time?

434
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,983
A good time? Is that all you care about?

435
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,107
North, Miss Teschmacher.

436
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,984
North. North, north, north!

437
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,032
Yes, Lex. North.

438
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,029
Look. It's his home.

439
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,821
It's Superman's home.

440
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,281
Oh, good, more ice.

441
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,707
- Fantastic.
- Fantastic.

442
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,800
It's fantastic!

443
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:36,469
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

444
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,637
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

445
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,819
- This place is genius.
- Genius.

446
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,657
- Lex.
- I'll be all right.

447
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,834
No, me.

448
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,987
Oh! Ah!

449
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,332
Why can't you be more careful?

450
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,419
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

451
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,995
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

452
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,762
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

453
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,847
This looks like some
kind of control panel.

454
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,566
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

455
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,608
- Ice.
- I said, don't touch it.

456
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,743
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

457
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:51,878
Kryptonian memory bank.
Education crystal number 308.

458
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,299
- I told you it's a crystal.
- Shut up.

459
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,465
Earth culture, section B.

460
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:01,304
Trees by Joyce Kilmer
of the Planet Earth.

461
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,062
What's this?

462
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,393
I think that I shall never see

463
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,979
A poem lovely as a tree.

464
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,395
- A tree whose hungry mouth...
- He's not here.

465
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,614
It's a voice from the past. That's cute.
That's very cute.

466
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,147
A tree that looks at God all day--

467
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,565
I like trees.

468
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,490
So does your average cocker spaniel.
Give me another one.

469
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,411
No, no, no. The big one there.

470
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,012
Kal-El, my son...

471
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,093
...as keeper of the
archives of Krypton...

472
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,430
...it falls to me to tell you of the
darkest episode in our planet's history.

473
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,178
Now, this I wanna hear.

474
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,643
After eons of harmony, there appeared
among us three rebel elements.

475
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,192
What you would call on Earth "criminals."

476
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,856
Criminals. My kind of people.

477
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,695
Despite all our efforts, we were
unable to change their evil natures...

478
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,356
...their evil ways.

479
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,701
And as you know, we had no death penalty.

480
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,486
- Sensible enough.
- Therefore...

481
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,620
...our scientists constructed
the Phantom Zone.

482
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,539
In it, we placed these
three arch criminals...

483
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,880
...imprisoning them
there for all eternity.

484
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,301
No possibility for parole?

485
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,965
Your father, Jor-El, thought long
and hard upon that question.

486
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,887
- I asked the right question.
- And there is one danger.

487
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,966
The Phantom Zone might...

488
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:33,064
...just might, be cracked by a
nuclear explosion in space.

489
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,645
I wish you had not asked me that.

490
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,737
I didn't ask anything.

491
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,656
We do not know what would
happen if they were to escape.

492
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,873
On Krypton, these villains
were uncontrollable.

493
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:51,825
On Earth, they would have the
same powers, each one of them...

494
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,749
...that you have.

495
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,921
- Think of it.
- The first of the three...

496
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,246
- Three.
- ...is their leader, General Zod.

497
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,382
- Three super villains.
- Together with Non and Ursa--

498
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,050
Each one with the same power he has.

499
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,600
Each one totally dedicated to
corruption, violence and evil.

500
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,436
That explains the three alpha waves
I've been getting on my black box.

501
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,104
They'll need a contact on Earth.

502
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:19,072
Someone with the same contempt for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

503
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,404
South, Miss Teschmacher.

504
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,698
You know, it's really amazing.

505
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,453
I never started to put
it together before now.

506
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,576
It's just kind of funny, because a good
reporter doesn't let anything slip by her.

507
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,115
No, of course not.

508
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,078
Well, I'm beginning to get the picture.

509
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:39,919
As usual, Lois, I really don't
know what you're talking about.

510
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,264
Tell you what, I'll meet
you back at the hotel.

511
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,085
What's your hurry, Superman?

512
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,429
Sorry?

513
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,774
I gotta admit, your
disguise is nearly perfect.

514
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,307
You had me fooled.

515
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,563
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

516
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,152
No, of course not, Lois.

517
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,487
I mean, you just have
an active imagination.

518
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,153
You just get carried away sometimes.

519
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,991
- I understand. Lt can happen to anybody.
- Listen.

520
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,617
I'm so sure that you're Superman, that
I'm willing to bet my life on it.

521
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,659
What?

522
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,996
Now, if I'm right, you'll
turn into Superman.

523
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,125
And if I'm wrong...

524
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,415
...you've got yourself
one hell of a story.

525
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,341
You think I'm Superman?

526
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,013
Boy, you certainly have
some imagination, Lois.

527
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,850
For a minute you almost had me convinced.
For a minute.

528
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,096
Bye-bye, baby.

529
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,113
Oh, my God!

530
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,607
Excuse me, please.

531
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,875
Superman!

532
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,552
Lois, swim. Swim!

533
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,215
Help!

534
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,180
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God.

535
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,716
Clark!

536
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,659
Lois, grab the branch!

537
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,831
What?

538
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,416
Help!

539
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,280
Lois, you all right?

540
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,540
I gotcha.

541
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,956
Here, here, here!

542
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,415
Clark!

543
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,142
You're what I thought was Superman?

544
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,887
Sorry.

545
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,889
This is really embarrassing.

546
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,630
So this is planet Houston.

547
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,179
A very strange surface.

548
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,889
A primitive sort of life form.

549
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,316
Hm...

550
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,989
Did you see that?

551
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,485
Did you see what I did?

552
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,250
I have powers beyond reason here.

553
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,660
We all have them, my dear.

554
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,273
Boy, I sure must have
looked like an idiot.

555
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,899
Jumping in the river, waiting for Mr.
Wonderful...

556
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,528
...who obviously had better things to do.

557
00:51:55,904 --> 00:52:00,454
Well, I'm sure it must have been
something very important, Lois.

558
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,787
And then thinking that you were...

559
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,787
if Perry White could see me now.

560
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,968
Where's my comb?

561
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,427
God, not only have I lost
my mind, I've lost my comb.

562
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,095
Clark, can you pass me that
brush over there, please?

563
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,965
Sure.

564
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,984
Clark!

565
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,646
- No, no, no. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

566
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,614
- No, no. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

567
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:56,007
- You are Superman.
- Lois, come on. Don't be s--

568
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,030
I'm sorry.

569
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,816
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

570
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,623
I don't know why I did that.

571
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,121
Maybe you wanted to.

572
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,618
I don't think I did.

573
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:37,209
Well, maybe you didn't
want to with your mind...

574
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,630
...but maybe you wanted
to with your heart.

575
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,716
We'd better talk.

576
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,480
I'm in love with you.

577
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,693
Well, we really better talk.

578
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:01,994
I'm listening.

579
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,330
We can't talk here. Perry will call at
about 6 to find out what's happening.

580
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,504
"What's happening"? That's the
understatement of the year.

581
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,417
Where do you wanna talk?

582
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,260
Lois.

583
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,438
Now that you know, I think
you should know it all.

584
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,114
I want to.

585
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,568
Let's go to my place.

586
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,950
Maybe I should change first.

587
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,285
Maybe you should too.

588
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:24,445
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

589
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,572
You can eat anything you want, Duane.
You can eat meat and potatoes.

590
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,622
I couldn't go anywhere where
I was expected to eat fish.

591
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,496
They got beans.

592
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,923
I can't eat beans. I'll come
out in a rash if I eat beans.

593
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,133
Look, Duane...

594
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,956
...they have a wide selection.

595
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,263
I think I'll try the fish.

596
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:58,149
I don't know. From the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

597
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:06,145
Hey, you hippies, get
your butts off the road!

598
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,621
I like the globe. It flashes
red like our Krypton sun.

599
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,203
But not this irritating noise.

600
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,699
Make way.

601
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,372
Did I hear right?

602
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,330
That son of a bitch give me an order?

603
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,706
Duane, you take care of it.

604
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,048
- But I--
- Duane.

605
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,883
You gotta learn to kick ass,
you wanna be a peacemaker.

606
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,061
Ail right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

607
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,229
What is this symbol?

608
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,228
Do you follow another leader?

609
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,730
Follow the leader?

610
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,243
Holy skunk sweat.

611
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,656
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort.

612
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,448
Huh?

613
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,326
Wha--? Oh!

614
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,751
How the hell did you do that?

615
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,756
Jesus H. Christ.

616
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,351
Crude noisemaker.

617
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:35,118
I'm just checking the tire, you know.

618
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,270
- Wow, this is your home?
- No.

619
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:45,515
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

620
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,320
No, this is a very special place for me.

621
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,784
I wanted you to see it.

622
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,355
Listen, you warm enough?

623
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,697
I guess I should be
freezing, but I'm not.

624
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,537
Good.

625
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,872
Come on, let me show you.

626
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:43,412
You see? You only smell strong.

627
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,923
Whoa, baby!

628
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:55,171
It's only because I didn't want to
lose my place in the orchestra.

629
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,764
Oh, my. The circus is in town.

630
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:06,733
Hey, sweet thing. Set
them buns down here.

631
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:15,188
Let's just hold hands.

632
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,735
Let me know if this tickles.

633
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,865
Mm-hm.

634
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,750
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

635
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:42,053
- Sheriff, what happened?
- Willie.

636
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,969
I think my arm's broke.

637
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:50,558
Girl or no girl, you're
gonna spit teeth. Get up.

638
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,065
What the Sam hill?

639
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,618
Is that you, Boog?

640
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,788
Uh, oh. Uh...

641
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,670
Ail right. Get them up and keep them up!

642
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,179
These humans are beginning to bore me.

643
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,519
- Please, mister--
- He's a general.

644
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,108
Please, Mr. General.
Please let my daddy down.

645
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,980
Hey-- Hey! Hey, hey!

646
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,534
You okay, Jody?

647
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,544
See, when my father died--

648
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,794
That's my Earth father, I mean.

649
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,633
--I found this crystal.

650
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,127
- Huh?
- Uh...

651
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:59,462
This is kind of hard to
explain, but you see, it, um--

652
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,972
It called to me.

653
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,139
Oh.

654
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,644
Yeah. And it brought me here.

655
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,142
It helped me to build this place.

656
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,887
Well, actually, it built it, really.

657
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,022
But, um...

658
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:18,859
...that's when I found out who I
really was, and what I had to do.

659
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,243
So, what do you think? You like it?

660
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,159
Like it?

661
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,044
It's incredible.

662
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,877
I mean, not that it couldn't
use a woman's touch, you know?

663
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,092
- Especially around dinnertime.
- Dinner. Oh.

664
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,054
I'm sorry. See, I don't
usually do too much about--

665
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:44,085
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

666
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,305
- I'm home.
- Oh!

667
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,811
Should we eat?

668
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,149
- Sure.
- Great.

669
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,779
Good morning, America. This
is East Houston, Idaho.

670
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,988
Until yesterday, a middle-American town
that Middle America had forgotten.

671
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,620
But today, the population--
Exaggerated reports put it at 123.

672
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,170
--Has increased by three.

673
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,423
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

674
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,256
As I look west into East
Houston this morning...

675
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:07,842
...I see a town gripped with fear.

676
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,681
Who's the big guy?

677
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,352
Okay, yeah, we've gotta be a--

678
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:17,058
- No.
- We've got a crack...

679
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,268
...in that diode.

680
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,520
- Come in on him if you can.
- Try to wiggle it.

681
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,651
Who else is seeing this?

682
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,698
Well, with this satellite linkup, just
about everybody. The whole planet.

683
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,034
The whole planet Houston?

684
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,949
Earth. The whole planet Earth.

685
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,618
Get over to the commentator.

686
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,958
You may continue.

687
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,794
As the extraordinary story continues--

688
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,882
- As this extraordinary--
- Enough of this man.

689
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,467
If the whole planet is watching, let's
show them something interesting.

690
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,344
Throw down your arms and surrender!

691
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,812
This is an order.

692
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,982
General Zod does not take orders.
He gives them.

693
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,094
Hey, you all right, buddy?

694
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,947
He was in the line of that fire
and nothing happened to him.

695
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,464
I haven't seen the likes
of this since Superman.

696
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,115
Yes? Yes.

697
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:08,052
The Newsbeat control room has informed me
that a fleet of helicopter gunships is--

698
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,764
- Mr. President, sir, can't we--?
- There's nothing anybody can do.

699
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,216
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

700
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,797
Where's Superman?

701
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,062
Where is he? Why doesn't he do something?

702
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,885
General Smythson has said that
nuclear weapon strikes...

703
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:26,822
...have been ruled out because of the
danger to the civilian population.

704
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,236
Starting fire run now.

705
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,829
Stand by, rockets.

706
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,621
Fire one.

707
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:51,335
Fire again.

708
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,681
Locked on target. Gotta take a run now.

709
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,968
The rockets didn't have any effect.

710
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,977
Look. They need machines to fly.

711
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,436
What bravery.

712
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:12,784
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

713
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,371
We're out of control.
We don't understand.

714
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,841
We're coming in, coming down.
Can't control it!

715
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,553
We're coming down.

716
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,063
I win.

717
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,733
I always win.

718
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:54,396
Is there no one on this
planet to even challenge me?

719
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:04,326
- Mmm. That was good.
- I thought we might, uh...

720
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,421
...abandon the orange juice for once.

721
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,591
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.

722
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,728
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

723
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,937
No. No, I really--

724
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,265
I really like it sometimes.

725
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,780
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

726
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:39,864
But, you know, if it weren't for
him, I never would have met you.

727
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,450
But he is you.

728
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:50,128
- It's kind of confusing.
- Not to me, it isn't.

729
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,921
For the first time in my life...

730
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,631
...everything's clear.

731
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:25,948
I'm gonna go change into
something more comfortable.

732
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,303
Come forward.

733
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,429
Your general wishes to speak.

734
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:48,847
I am General Zod, your ruler.

735
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:54,266
Yes, today begins a new order!

736
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:56,941
Your lands, your possessions...

737
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:02,199
...your very lives will gladly be
given in tribute to me, General Zod.

738
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,775
In return for your obedience...

739
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,662
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

740
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:11,708
In other words, you will
be allowed to live.

741
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,210
So you are a general?

742
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,384
And who is your superior?

743
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:26,295
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me.

744
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,346
Or all of his cities will
end up like this one.

745
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:35,475
Your father and I have tried to
anticipate your every question, Kal-El.

746
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,318
This is the one we hoped
you would not ask.

747
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:43,074
But I have to, because she's
everything I want in life.

748
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,869
And she, the one you have chosen...

749
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,366
...she feels as much for you?

750
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:50,910
Yes.

751
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,870
Then, if this is what you wish...

752
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,082
...if you intend to live
your life with a mortal...

753
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,422
...you must live as a mortal.

754
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,588
You must become one of them.

755
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:08,549
This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.

756
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,772
Once exposed to these rays...

757
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:15,603
...all your great powers on
Earth will disappear forever.

758
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,729
But consider.

759
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,611
Once it is done, there is no return.

760
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,740
You will become an ordinary man.

761
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,031
You will feel like an ordinary man.

762
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,042
You can be hurt like an ordinary man.

763
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:47,434
Oh, my son, are you sure?

764
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,273
Mother...

765
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,811
...I love her.

766
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,427
You did all that for me?

767
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:55,926
Huh. I don't know what to say.

768
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,273
- Just say you love me.
- Oh.

769
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:53,815
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

770
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,159
Imagine what they'll do to
the world if we resist.

771
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:04,177
The whole place is gonna fall!

772
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,191
Watch it!

773
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,388
You are the one they call president?

774
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,677
I am.

775
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:51,729
I see you are practiced in
worshipping things that fly.

776
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:54,689
Good.

777
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,739
Rise before Zod.

778
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,787
Now, kneel before Zod.

779
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,474
You are not the president.

780
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:25,469
No one who leads so many could
possibly kneel so quickly.

781
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,561
I am the man they are protecting.

782
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,650
I am the president.

783
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,895
I'll kneel before you
if it will save lives.

784
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,976
It will.

785
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,741
Starting with your own.

786
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,003
What I do now...

787
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:56,338
...I do for the sake of
the people of the world.

788
01:17:56,505 --> 01:18:00,585
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

789
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:04,181
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

790
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,429
I wish I knew.

791
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,022
Oh, God.

792
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:14,064
Zod.

793
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,226
Hey.

794
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:21,954
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

795
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,779
Yeah, I was just thinking...

796
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,501
...I can't believe what
you've given up for me.

797
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:33,828
Are you kidding? I didn't do it
for you, Lois, I did it for us.

798
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:37,499
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

799
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:41,631
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

800
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,550
Hurry up.

801
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,719
- Come on.
- Okay.

802
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,637
My back's stiff.

803
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,137
Come on, it's my treat. Come on.

804
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,357
Oh, boy, it's Mr. Wonderful.

805
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,244
Thank you.

806
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,068
- Do you have a men's room?
- Yeah. Right in the corner.

807
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,991
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

808
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,412
Hi, what would you folks like?

809
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,171
I'd like a cheeseburger with
everything on it, and a Coke...

810
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:20,004
...an order of fries and
a side salad, please.

811
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:23,757
- And for you, sir?
- I'll think about it when I get back.

812
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,759
Right. That's one cheeseburger--

813
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,721
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- Can I have my Coke?

814
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:30,599
Coming right up.

815
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,436
- Sorry, that seat's taken.
- It is now, sweetheart.

816
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,522
Can I buy you something to eat?

817
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,690
No, thank you.

818
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,106
Excuse me. I think you're
sitting in my seat.

819
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,445
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

820
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:53,291
Gee, I think perhaps somebody ought
to teach you some manners, sir.

821
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,956
Yeah? Well, let me know when he comes in.

822
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,625
- Look, Clark, we can just--
- Honey.

823
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,301
Excuse me, sir, would you
care to step outside?

824
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:06,258
I said, excuse me, sir, would
you care to step outside?

825
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:12,264
Now, listen, Rocky, your
steak's coming right up.

826
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:16,598
Keep it on the flame, Ron.
This is just a minute steak.

827
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,403
After you.

828
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,935
- Clark.
- It's all right, honey.

829
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,317
Clark!

830
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:29,993
You all right, fella?

831
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,908
He's gonna be fine, just give me that.

832
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:36,788
- Clark?
- Blood. It's my blood.

833
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:41,844
I think maybe we ought to
hire a bodyguard from now on.

834
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,343
I don't want a bodyguard. I want
the man I fell in love with.

835
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,680
I know that, Lois.

836
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,183
I wish he were here.

837
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,601
Clark.

838
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:02,187
Boy, you just don't have enough
sense to stay down, do you?

839
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,289
Settle down!

840
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,292
I don't like your meat anyway.

841
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,339
Oh, God.

842
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,385
Clark? Clark?

843
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,345
Clark, can you get up?

844
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:39,347
- It's all right. Come on. I got you.
- Go slow. Try and get up in that chair.

845
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,692
- Sit down.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

846
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,741
Okay, everybody, he's all right. Just relax.
We'll have some fresh coffee.

847
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,195
I'll turn the box on.

848
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,873
We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...

849
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,906
...from the President
of the United States.

850
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,504
This is your president.

851
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:06,670
On behalf of my country, and in the name
of the other leaders of the world...

852
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:09,838
...with whom I have today consulted...

853
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:13,183
...I hereby abdicate...

854
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:17,676
...all authority and control
over this planet...

855
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,773
...to General Zod.

856
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,766
Zod.

857
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:25,437
Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...

858
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:30,244
...will the lives of
innocent millions be spared.

859
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,359
Superman, can you hear me?

860
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:36,280
- Superman, where--?
- Who is this Superman?

861
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:42,541
- You'll find out. And when you do--
- Come to me, Superman, if you dare.

862
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:44,287
I defy you.

863
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:47,959
Come! Come and kneel before Zod.

864
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,802
Zod!

865
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,135
- Here? When?
- When?

866
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:59,103
Where the hell have you been, Mac?
On a desert island?

867
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:03,311
I have to go back.

868
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,478
You can't go back.

869
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,230
- There's no way now.
- I have to.

870
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,610
I've gotta try, damn it. I've
gotta try something, anything.

871
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:14,658
It's not your fault.

872
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,243
You didn't know this was gonna happen.

873
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:21,412
They knew.

874
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,829
I heard them.

875
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,289
I just didn't listen.

876
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:59,034
Hey, come on! Please!

877
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:01,536
God.

878
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,370
Father?

879
01:24:44,537 --> 01:24:46,077
Mother?

880
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:51,423
Boy, I really wish you could hear me.

881
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:54,585
Because I need you.

882
01:24:56,716 --> 01:24:58,426
See, I...

883
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,716
I, uh...

884
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,850
I failed.

885
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,109
Father!

886
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:30,179
You're master of all you survey.

887
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,345
And so I was yesterday.

888
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,020
And the day before.

889
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:50,163
Hello, there.

890
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:58,166
Lex Luthor.

891
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,553
You've heard the name? The
greatest criminal mind on Earth.

892
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,720
I told you this was a puny planet.

893
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,506
Wait just a moment.

894
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:09,809
Wait until you get to know me better.
Will you, please?

895
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:13,694
Wait. Look, I can give
you anything you want.

896
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:15,853
I can give you the brass ring...

897
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:20,732
...the unlimited freedom
to maim, kill, destroy.

898
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:25,856
Pius, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

899
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:30,372
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better--

900
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,747
We have all of this without you.

901
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,711
You cannot bargain with
what you don't have.

902
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,589
Magnificent One...

903
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:44,927
...what I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

904
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,513
The son of Jor-El.

905
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:50,348
- The son of Jor-El? On this planet?
- Aye.

906
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,095
Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage...

907
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,398
...or his name he travels under:

908
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:58,362
- Superman.
- Oh.

909
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,278
So this is Superman.

910
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:04,901
How do you know of Jor-El?

911
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:09,531
My Fullness, as I explained
to you before...

912
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,076
...I'm about the best there is.

913
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,535
Revenge.

914
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,705
We will kill the son of our jailer.

915
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,875
- Revenge.
- Revenge! Now we're cooking.

916
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:21,085
- He flies, then?
- Constantly.

917
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,304
- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly.

918
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:28,094
But, uh, Magnificent One...

919
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,801
...he's just one...

920
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,432
...where you are three.

921
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:37,637
- Or four, if you count him twice.
- We will bring him to his knees.

922
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,602
Wait!

923
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,439
First, you must find him.

924
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:46,068
And Lex Baby is the only
one who knows where he is.

925
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,072
What do you want?

926
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,413
Well, general...

927
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,157
...the world is a big place.

928
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,750
Thank goodness, uh...

929
01:28:57,915 --> 01:28:59,915
...my needs are small.

930
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:07,166
As it turns out, I have this
affinity for beachfront property.

931
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:10,683
What do you want?

932
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,926
Australia.

933
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,018
I can't understand it.

934
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:22,357
Where is he? He shows up every
time a cat gets stuck in a tree...

935
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,943
...and now he's decided to
pull a disappearing act.

936
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:27,109
Maybe we haven't figured
out his game plan.

937
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:30,448
Game plan? It's fourth down, the
two-minute warning has sounded...

938
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,615
...and the ball is deep in our territory.

939
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,374
Just how brilliant do you have to be?
I mean--

940
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,633
Superman's got something up his sleeve.
That's for sure, chief.

941
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,673
- We just haven't figured it out, right?
- He'll be here!

942
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:48,303
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

943
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:52,636
See? Yeah, and she knows his
plays better than anybody.

944
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:58,560
Yeah, better than anybody.

945
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,306
Maybe he hasn't heard
about it yet, chief.

946
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,407
Sounds like an earthquake.

947
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,276
Quick, take a picture.

948
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,707
Get down the back way! Get out!

949
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,255
Oh! Ow!

950
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:26,982
You all right, chief?

951
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:31,111
Even with all this knowledge when will
these dummies learn to use a doorknob?

952
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:34,741
Hi.

953
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,906
You should see the White House.
They'll be cleaning for months.

954
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,405
Lex Luthor.

955
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,577
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

956
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:45,333
Yes, Your Grace.

957
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:49,423
But what I've given you
is the next best thing.

958
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:53,417
You just hold on to that little
lady, and he'll be along.

959
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,181
See, they have this relationship.

960
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:59,603
She does all his public relations,
and he gives her every exclusive.

961
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,434
They're the best of friends.
You know what I mean?

962
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,137
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

963
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,442
You could use a tuck
here and there yourself.

964
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:10,766
Wait!

965
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,612
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

966
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,816
Kill the rest, starting with him.

967
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:19,027
Wait. Wait.

968
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:21,623
Don't you remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

969
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,536
We had a few laughs, right?

970
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:43,473
General...

971
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,349
...would you care to step outside?

972
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:47,979
Superman!

973
01:32:49,021 --> 01:32:50,861
Superman, thank God.

974
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:52,403
I mean, get him!

975
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,237
Come to me, son of Jor-El!

976
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,323
Kneel before Zod!

977
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,717
Watch out. You all right?

978
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,230
Wait there.

979
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,742
Son of Jor-El.

980
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,790
We were beginning to
think you were a coward.

981
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:47,578
I'm not a coward, Zod.

982
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:50,616
Let him prove it.

983
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,477
Then die as you deserve to!

984
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,775
Come on, come on, Superman! Get him!

985
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:27,162
Man, this is gonna be good.

986
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,251
Take him. He's yours.

987
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,855
Come on! Kill him!

988
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:05,661
Superman.

989
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,711
The big one's just as strong as Superman.

990
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:45,985
Ah!

991
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:51,543
Hold him.

992
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,660
Wow, home run.

993
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:27,362
Oh, my God! My baby!

994
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:35,871
Thank you.

995
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:47,090
This Superman is nothing of the kind.

996
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:50,046
- I've discovered his weakness.
- Yes.

997
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:51,471
He cares.

998
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,929
He actually cares for these Earth people.

999
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,310
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

1000
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,151
Sentimental idiot.

1001
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:08,907
He's caged Non.

1002
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:11,066
I'll draw his fire...

1003
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,162
...with some of my own.

1004
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:51,613
Get out of here! The rig's gonna blow!

1005
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:04,998
Get away from that truck!

1006
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:57,005
- Did you see that?
- They went down there.

1007
01:39:38,764 --> 01:39:40,314
Hey, what the--?

1008
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,598
Superman, help us!

1009
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:52,105
Superman.

1010
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:47,288
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

1011
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:51,043
You people, get back.

1012
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:53,341
Here, take the end of this.

1013
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:09,306
No! Don't do it!

1014
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:11,400
The people!

1015
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,820
Throw it!

1016
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,596
- This way, please. This way.
- Help me.

1017
01:41:51,396 --> 01:41:55,106
Where's your wife, sir? I got her.
I got her. Don't worry.

1018
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,859
He's dead. He's dead.

1019
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,449
Superman is dead.

1020
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,118
He's not coming out.

1021
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,619
- They've killed Superman.
- Oh, no!

1022
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:06,948
- What are we gonna do?
- He's dead.

1023
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:08,411
Let's go get them!

1024
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:11,120
- Come on, let's go!
- I know judo. Come on, let's go!

1025
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,409
Hey, hey, hey!

1026
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:45,739
What sound?

1027
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:48,411
You forgot your cha--

1028
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:52,082
Wait a minute!

1029
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:59,844
- I'm holding it, I'm holding it!
- I got it.

1030
01:43:00,799 --> 01:43:02,429
I can't see what's happening.

1031
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,845
- My hair!
- Your hair? What about mine?

1032
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,349
Hold on!

1033
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:23,648
Yeah, yeah, I got your message.

1034
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,198
No, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah?

1035
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:28,826
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

1036
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:36,853
Look, he's alive. He's alive!

1037
01:44:38,772 --> 01:44:40,772
It'll be all right.

1038
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:57,576
Come back, please!

1039
01:44:57,749 --> 01:45:00,129
Please come back!

1040
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:05,970
So he is a coward after ail.

1041
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:07,633
Damn it!

1042
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,551
Come back, Superman!

1043
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,980
What about us?

1044
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:20,234
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

1045
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:23,397
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

1046
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:25,398
Ah, phony!

1047
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:28,653
Superman didn't even do nothing.

1048
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:30,992
Come on, let's go.

1049
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:35,081
Get away from here. Jimmy.

1050
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,076
Our victory is complete.

1051
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:43,251
The son of Jor-El has fled.

1052
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:46,300
- Superman fled?
- I don't believe you.

1053
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:50,255
- The next time, we will kill him.
- The next time?

1054
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,600
The next time?

1055
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:55,347
What am I gonna do with you people?

1056
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:58,309
I held up my end. I
delivered you the blue boy.

1057
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:00,187
What do I get from my triple threat?

1058
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:03,864
"Bow, yield, kneel." That kind
of stuff closes out a town.

1059
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:08,317
Why do you say this to me when
you know I will kill you for it?

1060
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:12,197
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

1061
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:15,486
Extinguish the greatest
criminal flame of our age?

1062
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:18,620
- Eradicate the only man on earth with--
- Kill him!

1063
01:46:19,122 --> 01:46:20,792
--Superman's address?

1064
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,040
Come.

1065
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:30,382
The three of us will crush
the son of our jailer.

1066
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:33,514
Why not increase his handicap?

1067
01:46:33,678 --> 01:46:36,558
Since he cares so much for
these Earth creatures...

1068
01:46:36,848 --> 01:46:39,308
...let us take his favorite.

1069
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:35,407
Hey, ever heard of parachutes?

1070
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,622
Another small step for mankind.

1071
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,420
Scruffy.

1072
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,590
So morbid.

1073
01:47:48,753 --> 01:47:52,383
A sentimental replica of a
planet long since vanished.

1074
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,257
No style at all.

1075
01:47:55,427 --> 01:48:00,307
I expect better manners
from my guests, Zod.

1076
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:16,108
We must combine our strength.

1077
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:43,644
Fools! Take him!

1078
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:14,126
What?

1079
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:21,886
We used to play this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

1080
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:25,635
Superman, I knew that you'd-- Huh?

1081
01:49:29,312 --> 01:49:31,402
Wrong again, Zod.

1082
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:36,647
No, no!

1083
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,820
Release the general or
we'll tear her apart.

1084
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,740
Superman, no! No!

1085
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:44,159
Superman, don't!

1086
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,905
Ail right!

1087
01:49:58,341 --> 01:50:01,431
Did you really think we would
give up our advantage?

1088
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:06,345
Now, the son of Jor-El
will be my slave. Forever.

1089
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:10,390
If not, the millions of
earthlings you protect...

1090
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:12,732
...will pay for your defiance.

1091
01:50:13,064 --> 01:50:14,944
Destroy this place.

1092
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:18,278
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

1093
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:21,855
- Kill him.
- Me?

1094
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,282
Lex Luthor?

1095
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:27,450
General, you came to me with nothing.
I gave you Superman.

1096
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:29,117
Silence!

1097
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,909
Well, look--

1098
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:33,712
Watch it. Don't touch me.

1099
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:36,131
Guy's a clod.

1100
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,881
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

1101
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:44,601
I gotta hand it to you, you know.
You always told the truth.

1102
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:47,563
A guy always knew where
he stood with you.

1103
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:53,653
Try to get them all into
this molecule chamber.

1104
01:50:53,813 --> 01:50:56,113
It takes away their powers, see...

1105
01:50:56,274 --> 01:50:58,734
...and turns them into
ordinary human beings.

1106
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:00,152
Now, if you could...

1107
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:02,065
Shh, shh!

1108
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,449
- Don't go in there. It's a trap.
- Luthor, you poisonous snake!

1109
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,160
That's a molecule chamber.

1110
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:12,121
It makes people like you
into people like me.

1111
01:51:12,457 --> 01:51:13,917
You've done well, Lex Luthor.

1112
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:19,803
General, the crystal there
activates the mechanism.

1113
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:22,974
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia...

1114
01:51:23,134 --> 01:51:24,804
...activate the machine.

1115
01:51:27,597 --> 01:51:28,967
Thank you.

1116
01:51:31,643 --> 01:51:33,643
With your permission.

1117
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:50,006
And now, finally...

1118
01:53:00,398 --> 01:53:02,778
Take my hand...

1119
01:53:03,026 --> 01:53:08,606
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1120
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:49,241
He switched it.

1121
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:50,657
He did it to them.

1122
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:53,414
I mean, the lights were on out here...

1123
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:55,492
...while he was safe in there.

1124
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:59,792
Hey, you know something?

1125
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:02,168
You're a real pain in the neck!

1126
01:54:11,803 --> 01:54:13,603
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1127
01:54:14,764 --> 01:54:18,524
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A
lying weasel like you couldn't resist.

1128
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:20,847
Who, me? Are you kidding?

1129
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:25,110
Hey, I was with you all the time.
That was beautiful.

1130
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,435
Did you see the way they
fell into our trap?

1131
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:29,700
Too late, Luthor. Too late.

1132
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:33,283
Look. Look, Superman.

1133
01:54:33,449 --> 01:54:35,489
I got a proposition for you.

1134
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:38,200
Now, don't stop me till
you've heard this...

1135
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:42,001
...because I know I owe you one, but
we're in the North Pole, right?

1136
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,285
Let's wipe the slate clean.

1137
01:54:44,502 --> 01:54:48,172
If you give me a ride back, I promise
to turn over a whole new leaf...

1138
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:55,385
It looks so beautiful from up here.

1139
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:59,175
I guess I'll never get
to fly with you again.

1140
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:02,390
Oh, no. Anywhere you want to go.

1141
01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:04,652
You don't have to worry.

1142
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:07,654
I'll never tell them who you really are.

1143
01:55:07,817 --> 01:55:10,817
I know, Lois. I know.

1144
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:26,083
See you later.

1145
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:59,740
- Hi, Leueen.
- Hm.

1146
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:23,768
Hi.

1147
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:27,600
How'd you sleep? All right?

1148
01:56:31,067 --> 01:56:34,237
No, I didn't close my eyes all night.

1149
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:43,118
- Look, Lois--
- I understand, I understand.

1150
01:56:44,622 --> 01:56:49,332
I sat up all night listening
to the voices of reason.

1151
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:52,669
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning...

1152
01:56:52,839 --> 01:56:54,669
...when you've been crying all night?

1153
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:58,681
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

1154
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:03,852
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

1155
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:06,597
The doctor gets awakened in
the middle of the night...

1156
01:57:06,769 --> 01:57:10,019
...and the wife has to cope
with the fact that he's gone.

1157
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:12,356
I guess I'm just too selfish.

1158
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:15,279
No, no. You're not selfish at all.

1159
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:19,485
Yes, I am selfish when it comes to you.
I am selfish.

1160
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:23,536
And I'm jealous of the whole world.

1161
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:32,036
Lois, it may not be easy for you to
hear this now, but someday you'll--

1162
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:34,341
Clark...

1163
01:57:34,505 --> 01:57:38,835
Look, don't tell me that
I'll meet somebody.

1164
01:57:39,677 --> 01:57:43,807
You're kind of a tough
act to follow, you know.

1165
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:50,400
Now, I'm gonna be fine. You
don't have to worry about me.

1166
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:57,691
I like worrying about you.

1167
01:57:58,696 --> 01:58:01,236
Would you stop?

1168
01:58:01,407 --> 01:58:04,527
Don't you know that this is killing me?

1169
01:58:04,702 --> 01:58:08,832
Do you know what it's like to have
you come in here every morning...

1170
01:58:08,998 --> 01:58:11,578
...and not be able to talk to you?

1171
01:58:11,751 --> 01:58:15,381
Not be able to show I have
any feelings for you?

1172
01:58:15,546 --> 01:58:19,336
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

1173
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:22,339
I don't even know what to call you.

1174
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:28,429
Lois, I don't know what to say.

1175
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:35,404
I don't know. Just say that you love me.

1176
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:24,322
Um... Gee, Lois, are you okay?
What happened?

1177
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:26,280
- I just got so dizzy.
- You all right?

1178
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:29,740
- I don't know.
- Get her some water, will you?

1179
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:32,462
That's what happens when I
don't have orange juice.

1180
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:36,083
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine!
- Breathe. Breathe, Lois.

1181
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:39,842
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

1182
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:42,086
- God.
- Just drink.

1183
01:59:42,258 --> 01:59:44,838
- Okay.
- Just sip it, sip it, sip it.

1184
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:46,851
- I'm fine.
- Boy...

1185
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:51,179
What was I talking about before?

1186
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:54,024
If I know you, it was
probably about Superman.

1187
01:59:54,687 --> 01:59:56,937
- Him again?
- Clark, Clark.

1188
01:59:57,106 --> 02:00:00,646
You've gotta stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

1189
02:00:00,818 --> 02:00:03,278
Nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

1190
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:04,986
Well, I'll try to remember that.

1191
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:07,526
You better remember that.
I appreciate you.

1192
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,780
- You do?
- Sure.

1193
02:00:09,952 --> 02:00:12,622
- Especially if you get me a hamburger.
- Uh-huh.

1194
02:00:12,788 --> 02:00:16,118
A hamburger. At 9 a.m.?

1195
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:18,339
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

1196
02:00:18,502 --> 02:00:20,342
Everything on it.

1197
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:22,884
- Oh, and--
- Orange juice. Sure.

1198
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:24,969
Freshly squeezed. Okay.

1199
02:00:25,134 --> 02:00:27,014
Isn't he a nice guy?

1200
02:00:27,553 --> 02:00:31,313
Well, let's see what trouble
I can get into today.

1201
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:35,062
Leueen.

1202
02:00:35,228 --> 02:00:36,898
What's happening in the world?

1203
02:00:39,815 --> 02:00:41,355
Leueen?

1204
02:00:52,828 --> 02:00:55,368
- Hey, Ron.
- Yeah?

1205
02:00:55,539 --> 02:00:57,329
Give me another plate of this garbage.

1206
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,250
Garbage? That's my
number-one special, Rocky.

1207
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:04,093
Ail right. Get me some
more coffee too, will you?

1208
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:09,764
Gee, that's funny. I've never
seen garbage eat garbage before.

1209
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:21,690
Excuse me, sir. I think you're
sitting in my favorite seat.

1210
02:01:21,857 --> 02:01:23,187
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1211
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:29,607
Now cool it, Rocky.

1212
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:31,913
Take it easy, will you?

1213
02:01:32,076 --> 02:01:35,536
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1214
02:01:52,096 --> 02:01:54,216
Oh, God!

1215
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:08,073
This order's to go.

1216
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:19,658
I'm terribly sorry about
all the damage, sir.

1217
02:02:22,084 --> 02:02:25,964
Oh, I've been, uh, working out.

1218
02:02:49,653 --> 02:02:51,613
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1219
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:54,321
Sorry I've been away so long.

1220
02:02:55,117 --> 02:02:57,537
I won't let you down again.
