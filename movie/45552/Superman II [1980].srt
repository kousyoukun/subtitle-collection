1
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,440
<i>Alert, alert, alert!</i>

2
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,600
<i>You three criminals have been caught
in a further act of seditious treason.</i>

3
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,520
<i>General Zod, your only feeling
was contempt for our society.</i>

4
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,520
<i>Your only desire was to command.</i>

5
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,800
<i>Ursa, the only feeling you showed
was for your vicious general.</i>

6
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,840
<i>Your only wish, to rule at his side.</i>

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,800
<i>Non, you are as without thought
as you are without voice.</i>

8
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
<i>This council has no hesitation
in proclaiming you...</i>

9
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,840
<i>...all guilty!</i>

10
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,120
<i>Guilty!</i>

11
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,280
<i>You will lie down before me, Jor-El.</i>

12
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,040
<i>Both you and them one day, Jor-El.</i>

13
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
<i>Jor-El!</i>

14
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,320
<i>- Here, I'll just get the door for you.
- Yeah, thanks...</i>

15
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Sorry, after you.

16
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,920
- 'Morning, Phil.
- Excuse me, Kent.

17
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
<i>Hi, Alice. That's a very pretty blouse
you're wearing today...</i>

18
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,200
Catch you later, Clark.

19
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,040
<i>Hello. I don't know. Okay...</i>

20
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
- 'Morning, Louise.
- I'll check it.

21
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Mr. White, how long should
the pressroom hold the front page?

22
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,320
Give it another 10 minutes. I'll tell him.

23
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,280
Thank you.

24
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,120
If we don't get anything new
in the next 10 minutes...

25
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,400
...go with the wire service copy under
the 40 point banner. Picture in 3 columns.

26
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,440
Kent, do a background story for the page
three sidebar on this terrorist group.

27
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,280
Right!

28
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,760
Sorry. Terrorists?

29
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
Get your heads out of the clouds.
Where have you been?

30
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,960
I was at home.

31
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,400
Don't you watch TV?

32
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,040
I don't enjoy TV, there's too much violence.
I was just reading Dickens.

33
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,400
Mr. Kent, a gang of terrorists
seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

34
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,920
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.
You do, don't you, Kent?

35
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
- Yes. Has anyone been hurt?
- So far the hostages are unharmed.

36
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Hostages?

37
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,360
- Tourists, about 20 of them.
- That's just penny ante stuff.

38
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,040
If the French government
doesn't meet their demands...

39
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,400
...they've got a Hydrogen bomb
to level Paris.

40
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. White, that's terrible!

41
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,520
That's why they call them terrorists, Kent.

42
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
Get to the morgue. I want to know
everything there is on terrorism...

43
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,280
Does Lois know about this yet?

44
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,920
- Does she know about it? She's in it!
- She's what?

45
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,040
When the story broke,
I bundled her on the first Concorde.

46
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,240
If Paris might go kablooey,
I want my best reporter there.

47
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
<i>But gee...</i>

48
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,760
No offense. You're good,
but Lois Lane is better.

49
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
No, I meant,
isn't that a little bit dangerous, sir?

50
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,160
That goes with the territory, Kent.

51
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Don't worry, if I know Lois Lane,
she'll not only come back...

52
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,360
...with a Pulitzer Prize story,
but a one-on-one interview...

53
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,400
...with the hydrogen bomb titled:
"What Makes Me Tick. "

54
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
<i>Now don't stand around, Kent...</i>

55
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,440
<i>Merci, Merci.</i>

56
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,080
How did they get up there?

57
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,640
They were disguised as workers
to do repairs.

58
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,120
Can you say why they released
the first hostages?

59
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,160
We insist they do this to show good faith.
If not, we refuse to negotiate.

60
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Will they release the other hostages?

61
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,840
In return for a guarantee
that we will not launch an attack on them.

62
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,600
There will no be attack?
No attempt to overpower the terrorists?

63
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
- We've made this guarantee.
- You'll honor it?

64
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,040
We have not the choice to refuse.

65
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,600
If we believe it's a real
hydrogen bomb they have.

66
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,800
Where is the bomb?

67
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
It's in a big oil can.

68
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,000
A hydrogen bomb? Are you sure?

69
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,760
How can we be sure? Today it's possible
to make a bomb if you have the equipment.

70
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,520
<i>- This could blow up all of Paris.
- Oui.</i>

71
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,520
The position of your government?
Will they meet the demands?

72
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,040
I am not authorized
to say what they will do.

73
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,000
At this moment there is an emergency
meeting in the Elysée Palace.

74
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,360
<i>Non, ce n'est pas possible.</i>

75
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,160
<i>Excusez-moi? No. No comprende.
Moi, journaliste Americaine.</i>

76
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,920
<i>Non, non, c'est interdit!
Complétement interdit.</i>

77
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,560
<i>Attends. Wait.</i>

78
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,880
<i>- Voilà. Qu'est-ce que c'est le mot pour...
- Qu'est-ce que vous voulez></i>

79
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,680
<i>- Stairs. Stairs?
- Stairs...</i>

80
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,120
<i>S- T... S-T-A...</i>

81
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,840
<i>Mademoiselle!</i>

82
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,080
We'll bring them down now.

83
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,960
Get in.

84
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,400
<i>- Come on. Watch out for any tricks.
- Do we look like the sort...</i>

85
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,280
I don't know what you look like.

86
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
You're being released, so shut up.

87
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,280
- Come on then, everybody out.
- Okay, we're ready.

88
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
This way.

89
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
Come on. Quick.

90
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,040
Look, you're being released. Get moving.

91
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,280
I'll take a last look around.

92
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,240
Okay, send them down.

93
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Up we go.

94
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
Pulitzer Prize.

95
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
<i>CapitaI P...</i>

96
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,320
Should we have let the hostages go?

97
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,360
They'll give in to us
as soon as we plant the bomb.

98
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,680
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

99
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,080
Nobel Prize. Capital N...

100
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
...little o, little b...

101

...little e, little I.

102
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,560
<i>Nobel. Nobel. Nobel, Nobel...</i>

103
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,080
Prize!

104
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,000
Be careful.

105
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
It's me that controls the bomb,
not the bomb that controls me.

106
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,400
I hope you have
not many sins left to be forgiven.

107
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Because if you let go of that,
you'll have only 60 seconds to list them.

108
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,280
You are right. Do you hear something?

109
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,280
It sounded like
someone moving underneath.

110
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,600
It's your nerves.

111
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,080
Where are they now?

112
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
They are near to the lift.

113
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,960
One is still inside with the bomb.

114
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,400
<i>Ils sont prés de I'ascenseur. Y en a un
dedans avec la bombe. Il y en a un qui sort.</i>

115
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,440
The third one has come out of the lift now.

116
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,800
<i>The third one is out now.</i>

117
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,480
The bomb is still in there?

118
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,920
<i>Yes, we think so.</i>

119
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
This is the boring bit.

120
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,280
Tell them to get ready.

121
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
<i>Standby. Attention! Préparez-vous.</i>

122
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,880
Get ready.

123
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,800
Come on.

124
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,800
We'll cut the lead cable
when we get the word.

125
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,200
Haven't they had time to find the bomb?

126
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,880
Of course not. They haven't.
We've been watching them all the time.

127
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,120
<i>Vas-y! Go. Now!</i>

128
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,280
- It started!
- Oh, my God.

129
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
I believe this is your floor.

130
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,800
Thank God.

131
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,440
How did I get myself into this?

132
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,080
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

133
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
- A bomb! There's a bomb up there!
- I know.

134
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
<i>Fresh melons here! Nice fresh melons...</i>

135
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Hi, Lois.

136
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,920
Hi, Clark.

137
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,920
Clark!

138
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,800
<i>- Have you ever heard of crosswalks?
- Yeah, but you know, I mean...</i>

139
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,160
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?

140
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Freak!

141
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,480
Clark, you were lucky that time.

142
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,480
You must more careful. To cross
the street you've got to look both ways.

143
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,480
Lois, usually I do.

144
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,560
Maybe you ought to
get your glasses checked.

145
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,320
Not everybody can have
"x-ray vision," you know.

146
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,200
Do I detect a note of jealousy
in that voice?

147
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,360
Jealousy? No, not me.

148
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
Golly Lois, what are you doing?

149
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,880
When was the last time
you heard me sneeze?

150
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,680
You are never going to
hear me sneeze again!

151
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,080
I read this book,
and it says if you get 1,000 milligrams...

152
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,680
...of vitamin C every day,
you stay in perfect health.

153
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,720
Golly, 1,000?
That's certainly a lot of oranges, isn't it?

154
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,200
- There are pills, you know. I've seen them.
- Pills. That's the modern way to do things.

155
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
This is natural.

156
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Besides, I get my exercise that way.

157
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
And Clark, you don't have to be jealous.

158
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't?

159
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,120
No, you've got so much going for you.

160
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
I do?

161
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,480
Do you mind if I give you
a little constructive criticism?

162
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,120
- Actually, yes.
- Be more aggressive! You have to...

163
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,040
...go from the instinct. You see something,
you want it, you go for it!

164
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,160
That's what I do.

165
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Yes, I've noticed.

166
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,600
- Perhaps I could help you there.
- Thanks, that would be great.

167
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,320
Let's see.

168
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,640
You put the orange in there.
That's very clever.

169
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
Clark...

170
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,240
...you know that I wouldn't say
all those things if I didn't really care.

171
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,760
You do?

172
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,600
What else are friends for?

173
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,720
"Friends"?

174
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Here.

175
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,600
Here's to friendship.

176
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,640
This is how it ends for
the greatest criminal mind of our time.

177
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Not with a whimper. Not with a bang.

178
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,560
How do they choose
to reward Lex Luthor...

179
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,840
...the greatest genius in this world?

180
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,040
Do they give him glory or treasure?
What, matter of fact, do they give him?

181
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,920
Life plus 25, Luthor. Get to work.

182
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor.
It almost worked.

183
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,280
I mean, California almost
fell down right in the ocean.

184
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,200
Millions of people almost died.

185
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,400
<i>If it hadn't been for Superman,
that overgrown Boy Scout...</i>

186
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,560
I want my Liberace record back tonight.

187
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,560
What are you going to do
with a guy like that?

188
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,320
He flies around so fast and everything.

189
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
I mean they can't even trace
that guy on that radar they got.

190
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,480
Every time they try he just flies off.

191
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
- Where?
- North.

192
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,080
Why?

193
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,360
To ski?

194
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,320
Every man has his vulnerable point.

195
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,960
Some, like you Otis, have more than one.

196
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,360
I didn't see Superman's in time.

197
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,440
But now through patience,
invention, and skill...

198
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,200
...my little black box is just about ready.

199
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,320
Oh! That little black box in our cell.

200
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,160
That little black box, Mr. Luthor.

201
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,040
What's it for?

202
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,400
That little black box
goes beyond any conventional radar.

203
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,320
It tracks alpha waves.

204
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,600
Alpha waves.

205
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,160
Those alpha waves will take me north
to his secret.

206
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,000
And his secret will give me Superman.

207
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,440
<i>The MAB is 196 at. 5.</i>

208
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
<i>We ought to see the old beauty when we...</i>

209
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,960
You follow the bouncing ball for a while.
It's giving me a headache.

210
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,360
Anyway, somebody's got to check up
on those guys.

211
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah, I keep forgetting about them.

212
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,840
How long they been up there, 45 days?

213
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,600
The whole world's forgotten about us.

214
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,800
Houston calling Artemis II.

215
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,840
Houston calling Artemis II, come in.

216
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,640
<i>'Morning, Houston.</i>

217
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,080
<i>Hold on, Nate.</i>

218
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,400
<i>- Yo!
- How are things going?</i>

219
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,320
All systems normal, Houston.

220
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,560
<i>Andy is out doing the geological survey...</i>

221
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,160
<i>More rocks.</i>

222
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,240
And Cosmonaut Boris
is getting some soil samples.

223
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,200
By the way, Boris and I are engaged.

224
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,840
I had a feeling about you guys
when I saw your Rorschach tests.

225
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,480
Just a little détente humor there, Houston.

226
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,400
<i>Surface conditions unchanged?</i>

227
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,360
It's mighty pretty out there. Mighty...

228
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,600
...pretty.

229
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,040
<i>Mighty pretty, right.</i>

230
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,840
<i>Look, Nate...</i>

231
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,280
<i>Nate, wake up, will you?</i>

232
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
That's it. I'm dreaming.

233
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
<i>Artemis, come in.</i>

234
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,520
Houston, we seem to have
an unidentified flying object.

235
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Unidentified?

236
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,600
<i>- What does it look like?
- A lot like a...</i>

237
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,400
...like a girl.

238
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,520
You.

239
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,760
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a man.

240
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
A man?

241
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,200
<i>What's your name?
Where are you from?</i>

242
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,840
What a fragile sort of life form it is.

243
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,720
Houston, come in. Houston!

244
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,640
Come in, Houston.

245
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,520
Houston!

246
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,240
Somebody help me!

247
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,960
- Artemis, this is Houston calling.
- What's up?

248
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,480
- Artemis, Houston calling. Come in please.
- What's going on?

249
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,600
- I don't know. We've lost contact.
- So?

250
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,520
I mean really.

251
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,920
Artemis, come in please. Houston calling.

252
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,600
What was that he said before?
He saw a girl?

253
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,400
- I thought he said "curl".
- What's a "curl"?

254
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,360
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used
to call a comet on an east-west trajectory?

255
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,520
How should I know?
I was in back high school in those days.

256
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,640
Strange.
I tore those metal fibers like paper.

257
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,760
And what he did...

258
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,440
...was amazing!

259
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,200
- Something is happening.
- Yes. To all of us.

260
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,680
The closer we come
to an atmosphere with only one sun...

261
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,960
...a yellow sun...

262
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,400
...the more our molecular density
gives us unlimited powers!

263
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,280
They come from there...

264
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,400
...a place called Houston.

265
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,640
Then we will go there too.

266
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,720
To rule.

267
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,720
Finally... To rule!

268
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,720
380 out.

269
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,800
381 out.

270
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
382 out.

271
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
383 out.

272
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,600
384 out.

273
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,880
385 out.

274
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,400
Lights out, Luthor.

275
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,880
I said, "Lights out! "

276
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,640
You guys are about ten seconds away
from solitary, you know that?

277
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,760
I told you to...

278
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,880
Freeze, freeze!

279
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,600
Go out there and find it.

280
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,440
- What am I looking for?
- You'll know when you see it.

281
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,440
I think I found it.

282
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,960
What is it?

283
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
It's a ladder, you dummy.

284
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,320
Hi, Miss Teschmacher.

285
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,560
Come on.

286
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
Hurry up.

287
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,120
Come on, hurry.

288
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,840
Otis, hold that ladder, hurry up.

289
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,320
Come up.

290
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,120
Here I come, Mr. Luthor.

291
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,080
Otis, we're sinking!

292
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,480
Get off, get off!

293
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,040
Excuse me.

294
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,600
<i>If you'd like to carry Mrs...</i>

295
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,040
<i>...Smith over the threshold...</i>

296
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
- What?
- It's sort of traditional.

297
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
<i>I can give you a hand
if you have trouble lifting...</i>

298
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,800
No. Of course not.

299
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,200
- Honey. Thanks, I'll walk.
- Certainly, dear.

300
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,440
- Here you are.
- Sure is pink.

301
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
Careful with the bags, please.

302
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,040
First visit to Honeymoon Haven?

303
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,160
- Yes.
- Together, anyway.

304
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,120
Yes.

305
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,800
Let me just show you
some of our special features.

306
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,880
These are our "Flames of Love,"
exclusive with this motel in the area.

307
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,120
If you want the flames to go higher,
you just pull this.

308
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,320
I see.

309
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,160
- Look dear, that's kind of romantic.
- In July?

310
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,840
Honey?

311
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,120
For a nominal charge,
our staff photographer will be happy...

312
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,920
...to prepare a special souvenir album
of your honeymoon stay.

313
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,440
He'll photograph you
in some of our more intimate locations...

314
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,520
<i>...in the "tub for two",
on the bear skin rug...</i>

315
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,480
Gee, reaI polyester!

316
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,760
And here's the bed.

317
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,640
Right. Thank you.

318
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,160
Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,720
Of course.

320
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. And have a happy...

321
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
...whatever.

322
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,240
Can you believe this?

323
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,760
Posing as newlyweds to expose
a honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls!

324
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,520
What a waste of a great writer. Writers.

325
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Perry White
and his Sunday magazine exposés.

326
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,160
How am I supposed to get a Pulitzer Prize
writing about a pink bear?

327
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,880
I don't know,
I think this should be exposed.

328
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,480
They get kids who are just
starting out and take them for every cent.

329
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
That's what Mr. White says.

330
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,400
On the other hand, this is kind of nice.
"Complimentary Champagne. "

331
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,800
- Kissing contest tonight.
- Really?

332
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,560
Lois would... No.

333
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,200
Look at this.

334
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,960
Lois? Gee.

335
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,120
Look, I found a complimentary corsage.

336
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,240
Everything's complimentary here
until you get the bill.

337
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Gee, you look very pretty.

338
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,760
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

339
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,400
You know, Lois,
I was sort of thinking, later on...

340
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,960
...I was just wondering what you
wanted to do about the arrangements.

341
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,080
What arrangements, Clark?

342
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,400
I was thinking primarily about the...

343
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,280
...the sleeping arrangements.

344
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,400
Mr. Smith...

345
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
<i>- ... The complimentary couch.
- Right.</i>

346
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,920
What?

347
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,600
Gosh, it's alive.

348
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
Very good, Miss Teschmacher. Very good!

349
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,920
Why am I here? What am I doing here?

350
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,560
Miss Teschmacher,
is this a philosophy seminar?

351
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,440
No.

352
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,680
This is a getaway.

353
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
- Getaway?
- Right.

354
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,640
Lex, how could you do that to Otis?

355
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,600
What else is ballast for?

356
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,640
Miss Teschmacher...

357
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,880
...north. Due north.

358
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,560
Right, north.

359
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,960
- Where's Jimmy Olsen when I need him?
- Isn't it beautiful?

360
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
Just gorgeous. Gorgeous.

361
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
- Lois?
- Yes?

362
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,160
Everybody's holding hands.
Maybe we should hold hands, too?

363
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,880
- Here's my hand Clark, hold it.
- Thanks.

364
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,280
You know what? They're afraid to let go.

365
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,320
- Why?
- If they let go, straight to the lawyer.

366
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,400
I don't know about that.
They look kind of happy to me.

367
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,760
Because you're blind.

368
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,200
Yeah.

369
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,520
- Here.
- No, I've got it.

370
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,400
You've got to look after yourself.
You've only got one pair of eyes.

371
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,080
<i>Lois...</i>

372
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,120
Here.

373
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,360
<i>- Right.

374

375
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,600
Son! Excuse me, please.

376
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Be careful!

377
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,000
Get down. Get down!

378
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,160
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

379
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,000
<i>Did you see what almost happened there?
That little boy...</i>

380
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,160
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

381
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,920
- Lois, you're amazing.
- Because I'm hungry?

382
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,960
No, I mean here you stand with one
of nature's most awesome spectacles...

383
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,920
...and you're thinking about food.
Aren't you impressed?

384
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,560
Once a girl's seen Superman in action,
Niagara Falls kind of leaves you cold.

385
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,680
- You know what I mean?
- Him again?

386
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,440
I'm sorry.

387
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,120
I have a one-track mind, don't I?

388
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,720
My one track mind's
telling me that I'm hungry.

389
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,640
- Hot dog?
- Hot dog.

390
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,240
- Could I have some orange juice?
- Freshly squeezed, I know.

391
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,920
Mom, look!

392
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,560
Yeah, honey, that's nice.

393
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,960
Oh, my God!

394
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,360
Help!

395
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,400
Somebody help!

396
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,160
Way to go, Superman!

397
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,680
What a nice man!

398
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,040
- There you go.
- Again! Again!

399
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm sorry. Only one ride to a customer.

400
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,920
Superman! Superman, it's me, Lois!

401
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,720
<i>Come here. You're going to get it!
Give me a heart attack...</i>

402
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,720
It's me. It's Lois. Lois Lane.

403
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,600
Hello and goodbye.

404
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,760
What's the hurry, seeing as you
happen to be in Niagara Falls?

405
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,120
<i>Happen to be in Niagara Falls...</i>

406
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,520
<i>And, Clark...</i>

407
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,120
Clark is not around as usual.

408
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,800
Lois?

409
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
- Here you go.
- Where were you?

410
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,120
I was getting hot dogs.
What do you mean?

411
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,080
It just seems kind of strange to me
that every time Superman's around, you...

412
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,360
...disappear.

413
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,520
Superman? You mean he was here?
Golly!

414
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,560
And you weren't. As usual.

415
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,080
- What have you got to say about that?
- Darn, I forgot your orange juice.

416
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,480
Clark!

417
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
No orange juice?

418
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,120
- Mush! Mush!
- I am mushing.

419
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,800
Ice and snow:
Is this your idea of a good time?

420
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,680
A good time? Is that all you care about?
North, Miss Teschmacher.

421
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,760
North!

422
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,600
Yes, Lex, north.

423
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,360
Look. It's his home.
It's Superman's home.

424
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,480
Good, more ice.

425
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,520
- Fantastic!
- Fantastic.

426
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,560
It's fantastic!

427
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,320
The construction goes far beyond
any known architectural theory.

428
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,440
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

429
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,760
- This place is genius!
- Genius.

430
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,640
- Lex!
- I'll be all right.

431
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,000
No, me.

432
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,000
Why can't you be more carefuI?

433
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,400
- This is beautiful.
- BeautifuI.

434
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,120
- It has everything.
- Wrong.

435
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,880
- Why didn't you go before we left?
- That was two days ago.

436
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,400
This looks like some kind of control panel.

437
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,840
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch anything.

438
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,160
- Ice.
- I said don't touch it.

439
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,560
- It's not ice.
- It looks like a crystal.

440
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,480
<i>Kryptonian memory bank,
education crystal #308.</i>

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,640
<i>On Earth, they would have the same
powers, each one of them...</i>

475
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,160
<i>...that you have.</i>

476
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Think of it.

477
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,360
<i>- The first of the three...
- Three.</i>

478
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,960
<i>- ... is their leader, General Zod.
- Count them, three super-villains.</i>

479
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,160
<i>- Together with Non and Ursa...
- Each one with the same power he has.</i>

480
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,400
Each one totally dedicated to corruption,
violence, and evil.

481
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,800
Wait. That explains the three Alpha Waves
I've been getting on my black box.

482
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,920
They'll need a contact here on Earth.

483
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,800
Someone with the same contempt for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

484
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,200
South, Miss Teschmacher!

485
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,640
You know, it's really amazing.

486
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,600
I never started to put it together
before now. It's just kind of funny...

487
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,600
...because a good reporter
can't let anything slip by her.

488
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,400
- Of course not.
- I'm beginning to get the picture.

489
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,160
As usual, Lois, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

490
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,080
Tell you what,
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

491
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,920
What's your hurry, Superman?

492
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,520
Sorry?

493
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,000
I've got to admit, your disguise is
nearly perfect. You had me fooled.

494
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,560
And I am nobody's fool, believe me.

495
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,160
No, of course not.

496
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,880
You just have an active imagination.
You get carried away sometimes.

497
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,480
- I understand. It can happen to anybody.
- Listen...

498
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,400
...I'm so sure that you're Superman
that I'm willing to bet my life on it.

499
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,760
What?

500
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,760
If I'm right, you'll turn into Superman.

501
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,680
If I'm wrong...

502
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,760
...you've got yourself one hell of a story.

503
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,160
You think I'm Superman?

504
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,880
Boy, you certainly have some imagination.

505
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,840
For a minute, you almost
had me convinced. For a minute.

506
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,880
Bye-bye, baby.

507
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,880
Oh, my god!

508
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,240
Excuse me, please.

509
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,400
Help!

510
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,440
Superman!

511
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,440
Lois, swim!

512
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,720
Help!

513
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,240
Look out for the rocks! Oh, God!

514
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,800
Clark!

515
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,640
- Grab that branch!
- What?

516
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,800
Help!

517
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,200
Lois, you all right?

518
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,160
Here!

519
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,680
- You were what I thought was Superman?
- Sorry.

520
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,000
This is really embarrassing.

521
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,360
So this is planet Houston?

522
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
A very strange surface.

523
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,400
A primitive sort of life form.

524
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,800
Did you see that?

525
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,520
Did you see what I did?

526
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,920
I have powers beyond reason here.

527
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,480
We all have them, my dear.

528
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,720
I must've looked like an idiot...

529
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,960
...jumping in the river,
waiting for Mr. WonderfuI...

530
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,320
...who obviously had better things to do.

531
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,120
I'm sure it must've been
something very important, Lois.

532
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,600
<i>And then thinking you were...</i>

533
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,960
<i>If Perry White could see me now...</i>

534
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,640
Where's my comb?

535
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,120
God, not only have I lost my mind,
I lost my comb.

536
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,000
Can you pass me that brush over there?

537
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,200
Sure.

538
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,840
- No. It's okay.
- Let me see your hand. Give it to me.

539
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
- No. It's all right, Lois.
- Let me look at it.

540
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,200
- You are Superman.
- Come on, don't be silly.

541
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,680
I'm sorry.

542
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,640
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

543
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,880
I don't know why I did that.

544
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,080
Maybe you wanted to.

545
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,520
I don't think I did.

546
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,920
Maybe you didn't want to with your mind,
but maybe you wanted to with your heart.

547
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,360
We'd better talk.

548
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,200
I'm in love with you.

549
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,520
We really better talk.

550
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,800
I'm listening.

551
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,200
We can't talk here. Perry will call
at about 6:00 to find out what's happening.

552
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,320
"What's happening"?
That's the understatement of the year.

553
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,760
Where do you want to... Talk?

554
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Lois...

555
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,920
...now that you know,
I think you should know it all.

556
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,800
I want to.

557
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,360
Let's go to my place.

558
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,760
Maybe I should change first.

559
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,080
Maybe you should, too.

560
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,840
- They have a wide selection.
- I can't eat fish.

561
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,160
You can eat anything you want, Duane.
You can eat meat and potatoes.

562
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,400
I couldn't go anywhere
where I was expected to eat fish.

563
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,040
They got beans.

564
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,840
I can't eat beans.
I come out in a rash if I eat beans.

565
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,600
Look, Duane, they have a wide selection.

566
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,400
I think I'll try the fish.

567
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,840
I don't know, from the look of them,
I'll bet $10 they're from Los Angeles.

568
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,280
Hey, hippies! Get your butts off the road!

569
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,440
I like the globe that flashes red
like our Krypton sun.

570
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,040
But not this irritating noise.

571
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,640
Make way!

572
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,160
Did I hear right?
Did that son of a bitch give me an order?

573
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,680
Duane, you take care of it.

574
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,800
But...

575
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,360
You got to learn to kick ass
if you want to be a peacemaker.

576
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,480
All right. Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

577
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,720
What is this symbol?
Do you follow another leader?

578
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,680
Follow the leader?

579
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,360
Holy skunk sweat!

580
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,400
- All right.
- A weapon of some sort?

581
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,560
How in the hell did you do that?

582
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,600
Jesus H. Christ!

583
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,160
Crude noise-maker.

584
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,040
<i>Just checking the tire...</i>

585
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,480
- Wow, this is your home!
- No.

586
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,080
Actually, I live in the city,
about three blocks from you.

587
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,280
This is a very special place for me.

588
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,040
I wanted you to see it.

589
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,760
Listen, you warm enough?

590
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,680
I guess I should be freezing, but I'm not.

591
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,640
Good. Come on, let me show you.

592
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,000
You see? You only smell strong.

593
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,880
Baby!

594
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,520
It's only because I didn't want to
lose my place in the orchestra.

595
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,040
The circus is in town!

596
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,760
Hey, sweet thing!
Set them buns down here!

597
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,880
Let's just hold hands.

598
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,240
Let me know if this tickles.

599
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,560
Your right front tire is flat, Duane.

600
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,360
Sheriff, what happened?

601
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,840
<i>Willie...</i>

602
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,400
I think my arm's broke.

603
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,760
Girl or no girl...

604
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,600
...you're going to spit teeth! Get up!

605
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,800
What the sam hill?

606
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,360
Is that you, Boog?

607
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,640
All right.

608
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,360
Get 'em up, keep 'em up!

609
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,240
These humans are beginning to bore me.

610
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,600
- Please, Mister!
- He's a general.

611
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,880
Mr. General! Please let my daddy down!

612
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,360
You okay, Jody?

613
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,920
When my father died...

614
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,600
...this is my Earth father, I mean...

615
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,400
...I found this crystal.

616
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,920
This is kind of hard to explain,
but you see...

617
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,800
...it called to me.

618
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,480
Yeah. And it brought me here.

619
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,080
It helped me to build this place.

620
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,000
Actually it built it, really.

621
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,680
That's when I found out who I really was...

622
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,640
...and what I had to do.

623
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,760
So what do you think? You like it?

624
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,280
Like it?

625
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,840
It's incredible!

626
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,360
I mean, not that it couldn't use
a woman's touch...

627
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,280
...especially around dinner time.

628
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,480
Dinner. I'm sorry.
I don't usually do too much about...

629
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,920
Listen, tonight, sky's the limit.
Anything you want.

630
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,240
I'm home!

631
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,000
Should we eat?

632
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,680
- Sure.
- Great.

633
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,760
Good morning, America.
This is East Houston, Idaho...

634
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,160
...until yesterday,
another middle American town...

635
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,200
...that middle America had forgotten.

636
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,440
But today the population,
exaggerated reports put it at 123...

637
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,040
...has increased by three.

638
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,360
And these three new arrivals
bring destruction in their wake.

639
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,440
As I look west into East Houston
this morning...

640
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,160
...I see a town gripped with...

641
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,960
...fear.

642
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,360
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

643
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,200
<i>Okay, yeah, we've got a P.O...</i>

644
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,040
No.

645
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,640
<i>We've got a slight crack in that diode.</i>

646
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,320
<i>- Come in on him if you can.
- Try to wiggle it.</i>

647
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,800
Who else is seeing this?

648
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,720
With this satellite link up,
just about everybody. The whole planet.

649
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,920
- The whole planet Houston?
- Earth.

650
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,040
The whole planet Earth.

651
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,360
<i>Get over to the commentator.</i>

652
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,160
<i>You may continue.</i>

653
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,840
<i>As the extraordinary story continues...</i>

654
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,680
<i>As this extraordinary story...</i>

655
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,640
If the whole planet is watching, can't we
show them something more interesting?

656
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,160
<i>Throw down your arms and surrender!</i>

657
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,280
<i>This is an order!</i>

658
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,640
GeneraI Zod does not take orders.
He gives them.

659
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,880
You all right, buddy?

660
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,880
He was right in the line of fire
and nothing happened to him!

661
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,320
I haven't seen the likes of this
since Superman.

662
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,080
<i>Yes. The Newsbeat control room
has just informed me...</i>

663
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,160
<i>...that a fleet of helicopter gun ships
is on it's way...</i>

664
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,720
<i>- Mr. President, can't we...
- I'm afraid there's nothing anybody can do.</i>

665
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,200
They have such powers,
nothing can stop them.

666
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,960
Where's Superman? Where is he?

667
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,840
Why doesn't he do something?

668
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,640
General Smythson has informed us
that nuclear weapon strikes...

669
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,600
...have been ruled out because of
the danger to the civilian population.

670
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,120
<i>Starting firing run now.</i>

671
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,160
<i>Standby, rockets.</i>

672
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,680
<i>Fire one.</i>

673
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,080
<i>Fire again.</i>

674
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,120
<i>Fire again.</i>

675
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,400
<i>The rockets didn't have any effect.</i>

676
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,480
Look, they need machines to fly!

677
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,240
What bravery!

678
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,520
Be nice to them, my dear.
Blow them a kiss.

679
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,120
<i>We're out of control. I don't understand.</i>

680
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,040
<i>We're coming in... Coming down...
can't control it!</i>

681
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,400
<i>We're coming down!</i>

682
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,040
I win.

683
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,560
I always win.

684
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,520
<i>Is there no one on this planet
to even challenge me?</i>

685
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,840
That was good.

686
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,960
I thought we might...

687
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,600
...abandon the orange juice for once.

688
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

689
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,920
Must be tough being Clark Kent, isn't it?

690
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,160
No.

691
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,720
I really like it sometimes.

692
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,600
Even though I do make a fool of myself.

693
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,280
You know, if it weren't for him...

694
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,720
...I never would have met you.

695
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,080
But... He is you.

696
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,680
It's kind of confusing.

697
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,880
Not to me, it isn't.

698
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,400
For the first time in my life...

699
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,160
...everything's clear.

700
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,760
I'm going to go change into something
more comfortable.

701
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,160
Come forward.
Your general wishes to speak.

702
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,640
I am General Zod.

703
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,640
Your ruler.

704
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,560
Yes, today begins a new order!

705
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,240
Your lands, your possessions,
your very lives...

706
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,000
...will gladly be given
in tribute to me, General Zod!

707
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,600
In return for your obedience...

708
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,640
...you will enjoy my generous protection.

709
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,680
In other words, you will be allowed to live.

710
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,120
<i>So you are a general...</i>

711
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,200
And who is your superior?

712
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,240
- I answer only to the president.
- And he will answer to me...

713
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,640
...or all of his cities
will end up like this one!

714
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,240
<i>Your father and I have tried to anticipate
your every question, Kal-El.</i>

715
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,960
<i>This is the one we hoped
you would not ask.</i>

716
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,400
But I have to, because...
she's everything I want in life.

717
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,080
<i>And she, the one you have chosen...</i>

718
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,960
<i>...she feels as much for you?</i>

719
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,840
Yes.

720
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,680
<i>Then if this is what you wish...</i>

721
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,880
<i>...if you intend to live your life
with a mortal...</i>

722
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,960
<i>...you must live as a mortal.</i>

723
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,400
<i>You must become one of them.</i>

724
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,840
<i>This crystal chamber has harnessed
the rays of the red sun of Krypton.</i>

725
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,240
<i>Once exposed to these rays, all...</i>

726
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,880
<i>...your great powers on Earth
will disappear forever.</i>

727
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,560
<i>But consider...</i>

728
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,240
<i>...once it is done, there is no return.</i>

729
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,640
<i>You will become an ordinary man.</i>

730
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,600
<i>You will feel like an ordinary man.</i>

731
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,320
<i>You can be hurt like an ordinary man.</i>

732
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,920
<i>My son, are you sure?</i>

733
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,680
Mother...

734
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,640
...I love her.

735
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,440
You did all that for me?

736
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,400
I don't know what to say.

737
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,200
Just say you love me.

738
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,800
Thousands of hours to create,
and they defaced it in seconds.

739
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,960
Imagine what they'll do to the world
if we resist.

740
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,320
The whole place is going to fall!

741
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,240
Watch it!

742
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,240
You are the one they call President?

743
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,680
I am.

744
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,360
I see you are practiced
in worshipping things that fly.

745
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,000
Good.

746
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,400
Rise before Zod.

747
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,640
Now, kneel before Zod.

748
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,360
You are not the President.

749
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,360
No one who leads so many
could possibly kneel so quickly.

750
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,520
I am the man they are protecting.

751
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,080
I am the President.

752
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,800
I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.

753
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,520
It will. Starting with your own.

754
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,360
What I do now, I do for
the sake of the people of the world.

755
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:00,560
But there is one man here on Earth
who will never kneel before you.

756
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,560
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?

757
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,160
I wish I knew.

758
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,800
God.

759
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,440
Zod.

760
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,080
You're awfully quiet over there.
I'm supposed to be the shy one.

761
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,080
Yeah, I was just thinking...

762
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,080
...I can't believe
what you've given up for me.

763
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,640
Are you kidding?
I didn't do it for you, Lois, I did it for us.

764
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,640
See, I told you there'd be
a hot dog place somewhere.

765
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,840
Okay. It sure takes longer
when you can't fly.

766
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,000
Hurry up.

767
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,040
- Come on.
- Okay.

768
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,400
My back's stiff.

769
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,640
Come on, it's my treat.

770
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,160
Oh, boy, it's Mr. WonderfuI.

771
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,040
Thank you.

772
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,840
- Do you have a men's room?
- Right in the corner.

773
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,360
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

774
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,520
What would you folks like?

775
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,000
I'd like a cheeseburger
with everything on it and a Coke...

776
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,800
...and an order of fries
and a side salad, please.

777
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,600
For you, sir?

778
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,640
- I'll think about it when I get back.
- Right.

779
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,440
- Steak and eggs, over easy, coffee.
- My Coke, please.

780
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,440
Coming up.

781
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,240
Sorry, that seat's taken.

782
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,040
It is now, sweetheart.

783
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,320
Can I buy you something to eat?

784
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,520
No, thank you.

785
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,920
Excuse me.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

786
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,040
Your seat's in there, four-eyes.

787
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,960
I think, perhaps somebody
ought to teach you some manners, sir.

788
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,040
Yeah? Let me know when he comes in.

789
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,320
<i>- Look, we can just...
- Honey...</i>

790
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,280
Excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

791
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,120
I said, excuse me, sir,
would you care to step outside?

792
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,080
Now listen, your steak's coming right up.

793
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,160
Keep it on the flame,
this is just a minute steak.

794
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,240
After you.

795
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,120
You all right?

796
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,440
He's going to be fine, just give me that.

797
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,000
Blood. It's my blood.

798
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,280
I think...

799
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,640
...maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard
from now on.

800
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,280
I don't want a bodyguard.
I want the man I fell in love with.

801
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,960
I know that.

802
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,720
I wish he were here.

803
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,000
Boy, you just don't have enough sense
to stay down do you?

804
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,080
I don't like your meat, anyway.

805
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,640
Oh, God.

806
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,240
Can you get up?

807
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,000
- It's all right. I got you.
- Go slow.

808
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,120
Try and get up in that chair.

809
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,040
- Sit down.
- I'm all right.

810
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,880
He's all right. Just relax.
We'll have some fresh coffee.

811
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,800
I'll turn the box on.

812
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,960
<i>We interrupt this program
for an urgent message...</i>

813
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,360
<i>...from the President of the United States.</i>

814
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,080
<i>This is your President.</i>

815
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,400
<i>On behalf of my country and in the name
of the other leaders of the world...</i>

816
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,400
<i>...with whom I have today consulted...</i>

817
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,880
<i>...I hereby abdicate...</i>

818
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:17,120
<i>...all authority
and control over this planet...</i>

819
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,360
<i>...to General Zod.</i>

820
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,280
<i>Only by strict compliance
with all his directions...</i>

821
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,920
<i>...will the lives
of innocent millions be spared.</i>

822
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,320
<i>Superman, can you hear me?</i>

823
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,000
<i>- Superman, where...
- Who is this Superman?</i>

824
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,760
<i>You'll find out! And when you do...</i>

825
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,280
<i>Come to me, Superman! If you dare!</i>

826
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,200
<i>I defy you!</i>

827
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,840
<i>Come! Come and kneel before Zod!</i>

828
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,200
- Here? When?
- When?

829
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,520
Where have you been?

830
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,520
On a desert island?

831
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,120
I have to go back.

832
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,360
You can't go back.

833
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,840
- There's no way, now.
- I have to.

834
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,640
I've got to try, damn it!
I've got to try something. Anything!

835
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,960
It's not your fault.

836
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,680
You didn't know this was going to happen.

837
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,040
They knew.

838
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,280
I heard them.

839
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,080
I just didn't listen.

840
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,800
Hey, come on!

841
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,840
Father?

842
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,800
Mother?

843
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,240
I really wish you could hear me.

844
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,400
Because I need you.

845
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,080
See, I...

846
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,520
<i>...I...</i>

847
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,680
I failed.

848
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,200
Father!

849
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,000
You're master of all you survey.

850
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,240
And so I was yesterday.

851
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,320
And the day before.

852
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,040
Hello, there.

853
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,280
Lex Luthor.

854
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,360
You may know the name.
The greatest criminal mind on Earth.

855
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,560
I told you this was a puny planet.

856
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,440
Wait, just a moment.

857
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,600
Wait until you get to know me better,
will you, please?

858
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,720
Wait, I can give you anything you want.

859
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,800
I can give you the brass ring,
the unlimited freedom to maim...

860
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,200
...kill, destroy.

861
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:25,440
Plus, Lex Luthor's keen mind.
Lex Luthor's savvy.

862
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,320
Lex Luthor's career guidance.
Lex Luthor's School of Better...

863
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,560
We have all of this without you.

864
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,520
You cannot bargain
with what you don't have.

865
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,000
Magnificent One.

866
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,600
What I am bargaining with
is what you do not have.

867
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,280
The son of Jor-El.

868
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,520
The son of Jor-El? On this planet?

869
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,360
<i>Possibly you know him better
by his nom de voyage, or his...</i>

870
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,240
...name he travels under.

871
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,080
Superman.

872
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,000
So, this is Superman.

873
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,360
- How do you know of Jor-El?
- My Fullness...

874
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,080
<i>...as I explained to you before...</i>

875
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,880
I'm the best there is.

876
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,440
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer.

877
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,640
- Revenge!
- Revenge! Now we're cooking!

878
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,800
- He flies?
- Constantly.

879
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:24,440
<i>- He has powers as we do?
- Certainly. But...</i>

880
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,280
Magnificent One, he's just one...

881
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,800
...where you are three.

882
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,120
Or four if you count him twice.

883
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,880
We will bring him to his knees.

884
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,640
Wait!

885
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,160
First, you must find him.

886
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,320
And Lex baby is the only one
who knows where he is.

887
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,960
What... Do you want?

888
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,640
<i>Well, General...</i>

889
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,560
The world is a big place.

890
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,080
Thank goodness...

891
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,600
...my needs are small.

892
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:06,760
As it turns out, I have this affinity
for beachfront property.

893
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,000
What do you want?

894
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,600
Australia.

895
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,840
I can't understand it!

896
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,280
Where is he? He shows up every time
a cat gets stuck in a tree...

897
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,880
...and now he's decided to pull
a disappearing act?

898
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,920
- We haven't figured out his game plan.
- Game plan!

899
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,680
It's fourth down, the two-minute warning
has sounded and the ball is in our territory.

900
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,760
How brilliant do you have to be? I mean...

901
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,400
Superman's got something up his sleeve,
that's for sure.

902
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,800
- We haven't figured it out. Right?
- He'll be here!

903
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,920
If it's at all possible, he'll be here.

904
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,320
See?

905
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,200
And she knows his plays
better than anybody.

906
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,120
Better than anybody.

907
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,040
Maybe he hasn't heard about it yet.

908
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,360
Sounds like an earthquake.

909
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,000
Quick, take a picture!

910
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,520
You all right, chief?

911
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,880
Even with accumulated knowledge when'll
these dummies learn to use a doorknob?

912
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,600
Hi!

913
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,760
You should see the White House,
months of cleaning.

914
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,160
You promised me the son of Jor-El.

915
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,120
Yes, your Grace.

916
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,800
But...

917
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,320
...what I've given you
is the next best thing.

918
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,800
Hold on to that little lady...

919
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,560
...and he'll be along.

920
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,200
They have this relationship.

921
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,160
She does all his public relations
and he gives her every exclusive.

922
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,240
They're the best of friends.
Know what I mean?

923
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,920
What an undemanding male
this Superman must be.

924
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,200
You could use a tuck here and there.

925
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,640
Wait!

926
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,360
- I'm sorry!
- She lives for now.

927
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,240
Kill the rest...

928
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,640
...starting with him.

929
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,680
Wait. Wait.

930
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,360
Remember the White House?
The Oval Room?

931
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,120
We had a few laughs, right?

932
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:42,880
General...

933
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:46,160
...would you care to step outside?

934
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,760
Superman!

935
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,880
Superman, thank God.

936
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,200
I mean, get him!

937
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,240
Come to me, Son of Jor-El!

938
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,840
Kneel before Zod!

939
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,640
Watch out. You all right?

940
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,760
Wait there.

941
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,440
Son of Jor-El!

942
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,600
We were beginning to think
you were a coward!

943
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,280
I'm not a coward.

944
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,400
Let him prove it!

945
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,160
Then die as you deserve to!

946
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,640
Come on, get him!

947
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
This is going to be good!

948
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,080
Take him. He's yours.

949
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,440
Come on! Kill him!

950
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,480
<i>Superman...</i>

951
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,000
The big one's just as strong as Superman!

952
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:49,920
Hold him.

953
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,480
Home run!

954
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,880
This "super" man is nothing of the kind.

955
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,520
I've discovered his weakness.

956
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,240
He cares.

957
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,720
He actually cares for these Earth people.

958
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,960
- Like pets?
- I suppose so.

959
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,720
Sentimental idiot.

960
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,760
He's caged Non.

961
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,040
I'll draw his fire.

962
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,080
With some of my own.

963
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,160
Get out of here! The rig's going to blow!

964
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,400
Superman, help us!

965
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,000
I never thought this thing
would go the distance.

966
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,720
You people, get back.

967
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,080
Here, take the end of this.

968
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,080
No. Don't do it!

969
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,200
The people!

970
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,120
Where's you wife, sir?

971
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,400
I got her. Don't worry.

972
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,720
He's dead.

973
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,800
Superman is dead.

974
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,520
They killed Superman.

975
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,000
Let's get them!

976
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,440
Come on, let's go!

977
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,120
Forgot your change!

978
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,120
Wait a minute!

979
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,560
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

980
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,200
I can't see what's happening!

981
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,560
- My hair!
- What about mine?

982
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,200
Hold on!

983
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,480
He's alive!

984
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,320
Come back, please!

985
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,040
So...

986
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,280
...he is a coward after all.

987
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,280
Come back, Superman!

988
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,760
- Don't leave us!
- We can't handle it without you.

989
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,200
- It's not our fault.
- He chickened out.

990
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,200
Phony!

991
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,400
Superman didn't even do nothing!

992
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,600
Come on, let's go!

993
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,040
Get away from here!

994
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,720
Our victory is complete!

995
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,800
The son of Jor-El has fled.

996
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,280
Superman fled?

997
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,120
I don't believe you.

998
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:48,760
- The next time we will kill him!
- The next time?

999
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,960
The next time?

1000
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,200
What am I going to do with you people?

1001
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:58,080
I held up my end, I delivered the Blue Boy.

1002
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:00,320
What do I get from my triple threat?

1003
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:03,600
"Bow, yield, kneel," that kind of stuff
closes out a town.

1004
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:08,000
Why do you say this to me
when you know I will kill you for it?

1005
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,400
Kill me? Lex Luthor?

1006
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:15,440
Extinguish the greatest
criminaI flame of our age?

1007
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,240
- Eradicate the only man on earth with...
- Kill him!

1008
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,560
Superman's address?

1009
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,760
Come!

1010
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,280
The three of us will crush...

1011
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
...the son of our jailer.

1012
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,040
Why not increase his handicap?

1013
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,400
Since he cares so much
for these Earth creatures...

1014
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,960
...let us take his favorite.

1015
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,160
Ever heard of parachutes?

1016
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,440
Another small step for mankind.

1017
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,240
Scruffy.

1018
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,120
So morbid.

1019
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,080
A sentimental replica
of a planet long since vanished.

1020
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,920
- No style at all.
- I expect...

1021
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,560
...better manners from my guests.

1022
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,000
We must combine our strength.

1023
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:41,800
Fools!

1024
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,440
Take him!

1025
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,720
We played this game at school.
Never was very good at it.

1026
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,720
Superman, I knew that you'd...

1027
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,880
Wrong again!

1028
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:35,920
No, no!

1029
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,880
Release the General...

1030
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,920
...or we'll tear her apart.

1031
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,000
Superman, no!

1032
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,920
Superman, don't!

1033
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:45,840
All right!

1034
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,000
Did you really think
we would give up our advantage?

1035
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,440
Now...

1036
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,080
...the son of Jor-El will be my slave.

1037
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:06,120
Forever.

1038
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,880
If not,
the millions of earthlings you protect...

1039
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,480
...will pay for your defiance.

1040
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,720
Destroy this place.

1041
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:18,040
- Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- We have no more use for this one.

1042
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,200
Kill him.

1043
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:20,720
Me?

1044
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,160
You came to me with nothing,
I gave you Superman.

1045
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:28,680
Silence!

1046
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,280
<i>Well, look...</i>

1047
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,680
Watch it. Don't touch me!

1048
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,560
Guy's a clod.

1049
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,640
Promises were made, gifts exchanged.

1050
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:44,240
I got to hand it to you.
You always told the truth.

1051
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,160
A guy always knew
where he stood with you.

1052
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,960
Try to get them all
into this molecule chamber.

1053
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,320
It takes away their powers, see,
and turns them into ordinary...

1054
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,920
<i>...human beings. Now, if you could...</i>

1055
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,520
Don't go in there, it's a trap!

1056
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,080
You poisonous snake!

1057
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,200
That's a molecule chamber.

1058
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,680
It makes people like you
into people like me.

1059
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,760
You've done well.

1060
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,320
The crystal there activates the mechanism.

1061
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,520
Lex Luthor, ruler of Australia.

1062
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,520
Activate the machine!

1063
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:28,720
Thank you.

1064
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:33,400
With your permission.

1065
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,880
And now...

1066
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,880
...finally.

1067
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,960
Take my hand...

1068
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,920
...and swear eternal loyalty to Zod.

1069
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,960
He switched it!

1070
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:53,080
He did it to them!
I mean the lights were on out here...

1071
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,360
...while he was safe in there!

1072
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:59,120
You know, something?

1073
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,000
You're a real pain in the neck!

1074
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,640
Are you all right?

1075
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:18,200
I knew you'd double-cross me.
A lying, weasel like you couldn't resist.

1076
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,080
Are you kidding?
I was with you all the time.

1077
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,960
That was beautiful.

1078
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,240
Did you see the way they fell into our trap?

1079
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,480
Too late!

1080
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,480
Look.

1081
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:34,560
I got a proposition.

1082
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,880
Don't stop me
until you've heard this because...

1083
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:41,680
...I know I owe you one,
but we're in the north pole, right?

1084
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:44,120
Let's wipe the slate clean.

1085
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:47,960
<i>If you give me a ride back,
I promise to turn over a new leaf...</i>

1086
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:54,640
It looks so beautiful from up here.

1087
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:58,600
I guess I'll never get to fly
with you again.

1088
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,800
No. Anywhere you want to go.

1089
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,360
You don't have to worry.

1090
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,160
I'll never tell them who you really are.

1091
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,200
I know.

1092
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:25,720
See you later.

1093
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:58,760
Hi.

1094
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,360
How did you sleep?

1095
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:33,480
No. I didn't close my eyes all night.

1096
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:42,160
- Look...
- I understand.

1097
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:48,520
I sat up all night listening to
the voices of reason.

1098
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:52,680
You know how vile it is to hear
the first bird of the morning...

1099
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,800
...when you've been crying all night?

1100
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,720
I'm sorry.

1101
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,120
I'm sorry, too.

1102
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:03,600
I guess it's sort of like being
married to a doctor, you know.

1103
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:06,080
The doctor's awakened at night...

1104
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:09,280
...and the wife has to cope with the fact
that he's gone.

1105
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,120
I guess I'm just too selfish.

1106
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:15,000
No. You're not selfish at all.

1107
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,560
I am selfish, when it comes to you.

1108
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,240
I am selfish.

1109
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,480
I'm jealous of the whole world.

1110
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:31,560
It may not be easy for you
to hear this now, but someday you'll...

1111
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,480
Don't tell me that I'll meet somebody.

1112
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:43,040
You're kind of a tough act to follow,
you know?

1113
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,160
I'm going to be fine,
you don't have to worry about me.

1114
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,200
I like worrying about you.

1115
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,520
Would you stop?

1116
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:04,040
Don't you know that this is killing me?

1117
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:08,480
Do you know what it's like
to have you come in here every morning...

1118
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:11,040
...and not be able to talk to you?

1119
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,120
Not be able to show
I have any feelings for you?

1120
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:18,920
Not be able to tell anyone
that I know who you are.

1121
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:22,000
I don't even know what to call you.

1122
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:28,120
I don't know what to say.

1123
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:34,160
I don't know. Say that you love me.

1124
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,040
Gee, are you okay? What happened?

1125
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:28,040
- You all right?
- I just got so dizzy.

1126
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,680
That's what happens
when I don't have my orange juice.

1127
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:36,160
- I'm fine.
- Breathe.

1128
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:39,600
- I'm breathing, for heaven's sake.
- Good for you. Good.

1129
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,920
- God.
- Just drink.

1130
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:44,920
- Okay.
- Just sip it. Sip it. Sip it.

1131
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,280
I'm fine.

1132
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:51,080
What was I talking about before?

1133
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,800
If I know you,
it was probably about Superman.

1134
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,600
Him again?

1135
01:59:55,720 --> 02:00:00,440
You've got to stop being threatened
every time the guy's name's mentioned.

1136
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,400
I mean, nobody expects you to be
anything but what you are.

1137
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:04,880
I'll try to remember that.

1138
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,680
You better remember that.
I appreciate you.

1139
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,480
- You do?
- Sure.

1140
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:12,040
Especially if you get me a hamburger.

1141
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,920
<i>A hamburger. At 9:00 a. M.?</i>

1142
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:18,120
Yeah, and everything on it, okay?

1143
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:19,800
Everything on it.

1144
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:23,960
- And...
- Orange juice. Freshly squeezed.

1145
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:26,680
Isn't he a nice guy?

1146
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:30,920
Let's see what trouble I can get into today.

1147
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:36,680
What's happening in the world?

1148
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,240
Give me another plate of this garbage.

1149
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:00,400
Garbage? That's my number one special!

1150
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,720
All right!
Get me some more coffee too, will you?

1151
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:09,160
Gee, that's funny.
I've never seen garbage eat garbage before.

1152
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,680
Excuse me, sir.
I think you're sitting in my favorite seat.

1153
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:22,960
Come and get it, four-eyes.

1154
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:28,880
Now cool it!

1155
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,760
Take it easy.

1156
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:34,520
I just had this joint fixed.
It cost me a fortune.

1157
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,880
God!

1158
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:07,600
This order's to go.

1159
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:18,760
I'm terribly sorry
about all the damage, sir.

1160
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,320
I've been...

1161
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,520
...working out.

1162
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:51,440
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

1163
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:53,560
Sorry I've been away so long.

1164
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:57,080
I won't let you down again.
