1
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,960
水 形 物 语

2
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,760
要吃点什么吗？

3
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,830
太美了

4
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,260
谢谢

5
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,130
一个S是Mardi Gras 意思是狂欢节

6
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,450
坦塔罗斯：源自希腊神话，喻指能够看目标却永远达不到目标的痛苦

7
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,810
什么建议

8
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,260
我确定

9
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,200
它不是垃圾

10
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,860
我不要

11
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,960
祝你好运

12
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,630
鸡蛋

13
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,160
鸡蛋

14
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,810
音乐

15
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,100
音乐

16
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,100
音乐

17
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,330
你还好吧？

18
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,400
暗号...

19
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,900
“魂断猎鹰喙”

20
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,930
走吧

21
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,560
鲍勃!

22
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,230
近来如何

23
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,300
我在这狗屁水泥屋子里

24
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,160
像个傻子一样等了你足足一个小时

25
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,130
每次都是在这个烂餐厅接头！

26
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,500
我会改地儿的

27
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,660
但是你没有

28
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,700
告诉我们

29
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,660
"鲍勃"

30
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,400
叫我迪米特里

31
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,430
同志们

32
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,400
我不是"鲍勃"

33
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,260
这是什么?

34
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,660
迪米特里

35
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,530
解剖学笔记...

36
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,900
还有...

37
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,260
实验室结构图

38
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
项目的研究地点

39
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,960
我们从这抽身所需要的一切

40
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,960
都在这了

41
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,860
我会向上级汇报的

42
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,130
我们必须得尽快把这事搞定

43
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,960
米哈尔科夫...

44
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,130
这个生物...

45
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,000
我觉得它能够

46
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,200
与人交流

47
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:34,960
交流?

48
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,300
是的 与人交流

49
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,960
我有足够证据证明

50
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,530
它是种高智商物种

51
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,860
它会识别

52
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,530
它会识别...

53
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,060
语言...

54
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,130
能对音乐作出反应...

55
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,560
你能把这些

56
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,630
也报告给上级吗？

57
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,660
我会的

58
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,300
现在...

59
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,130
吃吧 迪米特里

60
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,800
他们把这道菜叫做...

61
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,160
海鲜...

62
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,860
及牛排

63
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,330
海陆大餐

64
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,430
煮好的龙虾放在这

65
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
嗞喇嗞喇的

66
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,430
但是有点...

67
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,900
过软了...

68
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,600
还太甜了

69
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,630
他很孤独

70
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,750
非常孤独

71
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,660
念出我的手语

72
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,960
你根本没在听

73
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,700
重复一遍

74
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,130
重复

75
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:42,500
重复

76
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,200
念出我的手语

77
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,700
如果我们

78
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,030
什么也不做

79
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
那我们也算不上人类

80
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,100
莫斯科方面不会支持你的计划

81
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,560
为什么?

82
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,400
风险太大

83
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,360
时间太紧

84
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,560
什么?！

85
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,830
我们只有两个选项 迪米特里

86
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,900
其一...

87
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,830
你想办法推迟计划

88
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,230
至少一周

89
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,730
但他们明天就要实施了

90
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,600
所以...

91
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,460
只剩下

92
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,560
第二个选择

93
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,760
以色列炸弹

94
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,030
你把它安在保险丝盒子上

95
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,730
然后会停电十分钟

96
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,930
没有监控 没有阻碍

97
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,930
然后...

98
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,760
你把这个给它注射

99
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,460
注射

100
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,830
杀了它

101
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,160
毁了它

102
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,960
你还好吗?

103
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,430
我来到这个国家

104
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,560
尽我所能的学习

105
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,760
既是一个爱国者...

106
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,100
也是科学家

107
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,460
我们还有许多可以学习的

108
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,300
我们不需要学

109
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,330
我们只要让美国人

110
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,960
没机会学

111
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,060
书名：《积极思考出奇效》

112
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,430
会下雨的

113
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,560
你受伤了 你流血了

114
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,260
请进

115
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,230
你的撤离文件...

116
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,200
他们快准备好了

117
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,730
首先 我有个问题

118
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,900
是吗? 请问吧

119
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,730
你们想来点...

120
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:30,860
黄油蛋糕吗?

121
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:32,130
好的 谢谢

122
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,300
你注射了...

123
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:40,630
那个研究对象之后

124
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,530
你怎么处理尸体的?

125
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,300
我很好奇

126
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,730
我进行了解剖

127
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:54,800
没什么价值

128
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,500
列宁曾经说过

129
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:01,760
死鱼是没有价值的

130
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:05,660
列宁

131
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,360
说过这个?

132
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:19,530
蛋糕不错！

133
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,160
你有牛奶吗?

134
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,430
也许...

135
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,530
也许...

136
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:38,360
也许是...

137
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,700
你记错了

138
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,430
等我们的回信

139
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,530
不会很久的

140
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,290
《伯南扎的牛仔》：1959年首播，是美国第一部彩色西部连续剧

141
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:10,100
撤离...

142
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,800
已经安排好了

143
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,130
老地方

144
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,960
四十八小时之后

145
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,260
四十八小时?

146
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,200
四十八小时

147
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:07,330
真是倾盆大雨啊

148
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,430
今天没有暗号吗?

149
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,030
不要 不要 同志...

150
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:26,700
不要...

151
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:28,130
不要 求你了！

152
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,860
你

153
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,230
和我

154
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,460
在一起

155
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,360
在一起

156
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:07,700
不 没有我

157
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:10,000
没有我

158
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,750
关于她的故事
If I spoke about it.

159
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,990
如果要讲的话
If I did.

160
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,000
我要怎么说呢
What would I tell you?

161
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,020
我在想
I wonder.

162
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,270
故事发生在什么时候呢？
Would I tell you about the time?

163
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,110
似乎 发生在很久以前了
It happened a long time ago- It seems...

164
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,530
那位王子当政的最后几天
In the last days of a fair Prince's reign...

165
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,640
我们还是先来讲讲那个地方吧
Or would I tell you about the place?

166
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,320
那是一座小城 靠近海岸
A small city near the coast

167
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,060
与世隔绝
but far from everything else...

168
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,710
还能给你讲点什么呢
Or, I don't know.

169
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,760
要么跟你讲讲她的故事吧
Would I tell you about her?

170
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,310
公主无法说话
The princess without voice

171
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,110
或许我该提醒你
Or perhaps I would just warn you

172
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,060
这些故事是真实的
about the truth of these facts

173
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,640
这是一个悲欢离合的故事
and the tale of love and loss

174
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,660
还有那个
and the monster

175
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,140
试图摧毁一切的恶魔
that tried to destroy it all...

176
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,170
荷达克大人
My Lord Hedak.

177
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,890
你感到烦恼
So, you are troubled.

178
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,500
说出来吧
Tell me.

179
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,880
我
I have...

180
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,190
我有罪
I have sinned.

181
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,900
我触犯了上帝
I've offended the god.

182
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,450
荷达克大人 我是个罪人
I'm deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.

183
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,290
我自有判断
Let me judge of that.

184
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,010
我对祭祀仪式 有所怀疑
I've doubted the ceremony of the sacrifice.

185
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,350
警报声把你吵醒了么
Did the sirens wake you up?

186
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,800
那个巧克力工厂 着火了
It was a fire. The chocolate factory.

187
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,710
你闻到这味了么 我的天
You smell that? Oh my...

188
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,580
烤熟的可可
Toasted cocoa.

189
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,190
塞翁失马 焉知非福
Tragedy and delight-- Hand in hand.

190
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
亲爱的
Oh dear child.

191
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,130
要是没你在这照顾我 我就会日渐消瘦了
I'd waste away if you weren't here looking after me.

192
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
众所周知 我可是很耐饿的 看这个
I am the proverbial starving. Watch this.

193
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,780
看着楼梯舞
Bojangles, the stair dance.

194
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,250
这舞蹈挺难学的
That's so hard.

195
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,170
卡格尼就做到了
Cagney did it. Different but beautiful.

196
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,160
我也想学这舞蹈
I want to do that too.

197
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,710
好呀 准备好了么
All right. Are you ready?

198
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,050
- 好了 - 来吧
- Yep. - Come on.

199
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,490
艾丽莎
Elisa.

200
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,400
下次你来交房租的时候
Next time you're going to bring the rent,

201
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,520
我想让你留下来看这部圣经主题的电影
I want you to stay and see the bible movie, huh.

202
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,480
我这...我这有两张免费电影票
I got... I got two free tickets here.

203
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,030
把你的邻居查尔斯也带上 他是个好人
You bring your neighbor Charles. He's a good boy.

204
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,170
或者你要看喜剧片? 现在没几个人看电影了
Find a movie in comedy? Nobody's coming to the theater, huh.

205
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,230
我会给你提供免费的爆米花和苏打水的
I can throw you a free popcorn and soda.

206
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,010
哦不 我的天 那里应该放两个S啊
Oh no, for God's sake! There's two "S' there.

207
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,130
快点 放两个S
Come on. Two "S". Mardi Grass. Mardi Grass.

208
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,900
艾丽莎 快来 快点来
Elisa, come on. Come here already!

209
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,990
- 你要学会按时上班啊 - 嘿 你干什么呢
- You gotta learn to be on time. - Hey, what you doing?

210
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,480
- 就这么让她插队么 蠢货 - 少管闲事
- Look her in, Dummy. - Leave her alone, woman.

211
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,620
我帮她排了队的
I was keepin' her place.

212
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,140
我会检举你们的 我会来找你和这哑巴的麻烦的
I get reported. I come after you and the mute.

213
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,840
你去啊 尤兰达
You do that, Yolanda.

214
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,330
你去啊
You do that.

215
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,700
我这脚 真是疼死我了
My feet are already killin' me.

216
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,620
我那天晚上走之前 给布鲁斯特做了面包热狗卷
I made Brewster pigs in the blanket tonight before leavin'.

217
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
我的天 他就这么吃完了
Boy, he just ate 'em up.

218
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,070
没说谢谢 吃的时候也没发出声音
No thank-yous, no yum-yums, not a peep-

219
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,970
冷峻的就像一座墓碑那样
Man is silent as the grave.

220
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,100
如果放屁声是他对我的奉承
But if farts were flattery

221
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,700
那他简直堪比文豪莎士比亚了
Honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

222
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,090
然后我回家 给他做早餐
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

223
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,740
鸡蛋 培根 还有烤面包片加黄油
Eggs, bacon and buttered toast.

224
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,600
我还要给烤面包双面都抹上黄油 艾丽莎 搞得就像他是我儿子一样
I butter the man's toast, Elisa. Both sides-As if he was a child...

225
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,070
他甚至连一声谢谢都不会说
And I don't even get a “Thank You”

226
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,850
你懂的感恩 因为你是受过教育的
You'd be grateful, because you are an educated woman.

227
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,620
但是我家的那位嘛 身上只散发出一种野性的魅力
But my Brewster, all he had gone for him was animal magnetism back in the day

228
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,420
原来还挺吸引我的
And workin' awhile.

229
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,380
我的天
What in the same hell?

230
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,550
露！
Lou!

231
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,520
你们这帮小子介不介意把垃圾都丢到桶里
You boys mind puttin' the trash in the can?

232
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,750
垃圾就应该丢到该丢的地方去
That's what it's that for.

233
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,600
真是难以置信 垃圾就应该丢到该丢的地方去
Hard to believe, uh? That's what it's that for.

234
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,670
- 好 好 抱歉 泽尔达 - 我不知道他们整天在干什么
- Alright. Alright. Sorry Zelda, sorry. - I don't know what they're doin'.

235
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,900
要我说 你们真是搞得一塌糊涂
Makin' a goddamn mess, in what I'd say.

236
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,110
- 泽尔达 别聊天了 - 是 长官
- Zelda, stop the chatting please. - Yes sir.

237
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,820
- 没有必要说那些话 - 抱歉 弗莱明先生
- There's no call for the blaspheme. - Sorry, Mr. Fleming.

238
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,910
占用各位一点时间
A moment of your time.

239
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,030
今天有一队新的研究人员和研究对象要来到我们T-4设施
Today, we are receiving a new team and asset here in T-4.

240
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,420
这位是罗伯特·霍夫斯德勒 从加尔维斯顿调过来
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, from our system facility in Galveston.

241
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,620
我不是想虚张声势 夸大其词什么的
Now, I don't want to bolster or overstate the matter but uh

242
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,940
这个可能是目前这个设施里
this may very well be the most sensitive asset

243
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,360
最重要的研究对象了
ever to be housed in this facility

244
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,790
- 旅途如何？- 还行
- How was your trip? - Fine.

245
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,290
- 安保人员在哪？- 请稍后
- Who's security here? - Just one moment please.

246
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,630
- 安保人员在哪？- 欢迎来到T-4设施 长官
Security. Who's security here? - Welcome to T-4, sir.

247
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,900
是 长官 我是弗兰明 这里的安保负责人
Yes, sir. I am Flemington, Head of Security...

248
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,880
把闲杂人赶出去
Get them out.

249
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,630
帮我把这圆柱箱推进压缩机里
Help me move the cylinder into the compressor!

250
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,190
搬过来 搬过来
Bring it here. Bring it here.

251
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,070
艾丽莎 艾丽莎 快走吧
Elisa! Elisa, come on.

252
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,730
那里是什么情况 你看到了么？
What goes on in this place? Did you see that?

253
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,120
是的 我搞了些装饰品 看起来怎么样
Yes, I'm wearing the hair piece. How's is it look like?

254
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,490
小心车
Careful of the car.

255
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,850
严格来说那不是什么装饰品 是假发
It's not a hair piece. It's a toupee.

256
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,850
假发是不会脱落的 懂了吧
It's eternal, see?

257
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,450
坦塔罗斯难求一死
Tantalus never achieved the escape of death.

258
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,560
树枝上的果实总是放在他够不着的地方
There's a fruit on the branches was just always out of his reach.

259
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,400
每次他弯腰喝水的时候溪水里的水就退了
And the water in the stream receded every time he stooped down to drink.

260
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,450
这就是为什么我们今天说这些话
And so that's why we say things today like

261
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,630
看那些诱人的馅饼
Look at those tantalizing pies.

262
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,320
谢谢 你会回来的 对吧？
Thank you, ya'll come back, y'heah?

263
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,340
是的 早餐吃馅饼 相信我吧
Yes, pies for breakfast! Just trust me on this.

264
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,040
嘿 各位 欢迎来到迪克西·道格馅饼店
Hey folks, welcome to Dixie Doug's.

265
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,810
我之前在这见过你 对吧？
- I've seen you here before, right?

266
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,390
是的 我其实已经来过好几次了
- Yes, I've been here a couple of times as a matter of fact.

267
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,810
专点莱姆派吧？
- Partial to key lime pie?

268
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,660
是的 来两份
- Oh yeah, I am. Two to go.

269
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,700
别纠结啦
Just go with it, please.

270
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,020
额 我就好这口
Uh. I-uh. It's a craving I indulge in.

271
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,070
吃这个虽然对我的身体没什么好处 我喜欢的东西都不...
It can't possibly be good for me. Nothing that I like is...

272
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,030
这是很好的馅饼 酸橙味
No, no. It's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

273
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,840
你是鼎鼎有名的迪克西·道格么？
You would happen to be the famous Dixie Doug himself, huh?

274
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,520
当然不是 馅饼是全国派送的
- Heck, no. Pies are trucked throughout the country.

275
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,870
- 他们管这叫“特许经营” 明白了吧？- 哦
- They call it uh, “franchising”, see? - Oh.

276
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,630
他们给我们提供搅拌机 挂上他们的招牌 就那个“馅饼小子” 是我们的吉祥物
They give us the spinners, the signage. That there's “Pie Boy” our mascot.

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
我一般不提这些的
I don't talk like that.

278
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,870
- 我从渥太华来的 -不会吧
- I'm from Ottawa. - No.

279
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,780
我完全买下它了
I completely bought it.

280
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,630
“这个馅饼真不错”
“That's-a-great-a-pie”

281
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,750
那个小个子男人 他是意大利人吗？
The.. The Little guy. Is he supposed to be Italian?

282
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,710
我猜是的
I guess so.

283
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,340
真聪明
That was very clever.

284
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,980
你们都回来了？
Y'all come back now, y'heah?

285
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,750
“你们都回来了”
“Y'all come back now”

286
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,530
你觉得他说这话是认真的吗？
Do you think he meant it?

287
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,660
他注意到我了 你听到了他说的那些
He had noticed me. You heard that.

288
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,940
这个馅饼真恶心
This pie is rather sordid.

289
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,120
不要吐出来 下次去的时候 我们试试其他味道
Don't spit it out. Next time we go, well try different flavor.

290
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,740
待会儿再吃
Save it for later.

291
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,330
上帝啊 换个台吧 我不想看那个台
Dear God, change that awfulness. I do not want to see that.

292
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,290
我不想看那个台
I do not want to see it.

293
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,550
这个台还行 这个台还行
That's better. That's better.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,150
哦 看贝蒂！
Oh. Look at Betty!

295
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
年轻貌美
Oh. To be young and beautiful

296
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,960
如果时光可以倒流
If I could go back,

297
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,070
回到我18岁的时候
to when I was eighteen

298
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,360
我什么都不知道 我会给自己一点建议
I didn't know anything about anything. I'd give myself a bit of advice.

299
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,110
比如说 保护好牙齿 多做点爱
I would say. Take better care of your teeth and fuck-a lot more.

300
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,530
真是好建议
That's very good advice.

301
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,400
我漂亮的宝贝
Pretty baby of mine.

302
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,230
我漂亮的宝贝
Pretty baby of mine.

303
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,550
看看这个
Will you look at this?

304
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,690
看看
Look.

305
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,950
这里有我们国家最聪明的一群家伙 而他们却在这地板上到处撒尿
Some of the best minds in our country peeing all over the floor in this here facility.

306

连天花板上都是尿渍！

308
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,380
他们怎么撒上去的？
How do they get it up there?

309
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,700
你估计 他们下面那玩意得有多大啊？
Just how big a target do they need, you figure?

310
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,280
他们已经做了充足的练习 这是肯定的
They get enough practice that's for sure.

311
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,200
我的布鲁斯特
My Brewster,

312
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,840
可没人觉得他聪明
no one ever called him a great mind,

313
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,950
但是
but...

314
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,880
就算他 他都有百分之七十的几率尿进小便池
even he... Man he just hits the can seventy percent of the time.

315
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,080
- 抱歉 先生 - 不不不 没事 你们继续打扫
- Excuse us, sir. - No, no, no. That's alright. Go ahead.

你们女士们好像聊得很开心

女士们总能聊得这么热火朝天
Girl talk no doubt.

318
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,630
不必介意我

325
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,420
不不 男士一般是便前或是便后洗手
Oh no, no. A man washes his hands before or after tending to his needs.

326
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,130
那这很能说明这个男人的特点
That tells you a lot about that man.

327
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,250
如果便前和便后都洗
If he does it both times,

328
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,510
说明他性格软弱
Points to a weakness in character.

329
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,850
女士们
Ladies

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,290
和你们俩聊天非常开心
It was very pleasant chatting with you both.

331
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,600
矮个子的人很刻薄
Short people are mean.

332
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,480
我从来没有遇到过哪个矮个子的好男人
I've never met a short man that stays nice all the way through.

333
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,300
他们都是暗箭伤人的小人
No, sir, mean little backstabbers, all of 'em.

334
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,900
也许地下缺氧还是什么的
Maybe it's the air down there, not enough oxygen or somethin.

335
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,790
救命！他在流血！
Help! He's losing blood!

336
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,600
- 救命！- 快来 快来

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,250
你觉得俄国佬闯进来了么？ 我可不这样认为
You think the Russians broke in? I don't think so.

338
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,370

And If they did, Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

339

有两声枪响 你听见了吗？
It was two shots, you hear 'em?

340
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,630
其实是三声 还有尖叫
Alright three, and that scream.

341
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,360
这里究竟发生了什么啊？
Whatever happens in this place?

342
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,060
你们两个 跟我来
You two. Come with me.

343
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,530
现在就去么 弗莱明先生？ 能让我们先吃完饭吗？
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir? Any chance we might conclude our dinner?

344
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,280
- 现在就来！- 哦
- Now! - Ugh.

345
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,930
天哪 我们遇到麻烦了 我们遇到麻烦了
Oh heavens to Betsy. We're in a pickle. We're in such a pickle.

346

只给你们20分钟
You will have exactly twenty minutes,

347
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,390
把实验室给我彻底打扫干净
to render this-this lab immaculate and so on and so forth.

348
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,610
20分钟
Twenty minutes.

349
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,010
好多血
It's a lot of blood.

350
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,710
屎尿什么的 我打扫起来没问题
I can handle piss, I can handle poop...

351
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,320
但是血？ 我怕血
But blood? Mmm. Blood is just something to me.

352
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,870
拿去 帮我擦干净
Here Hon, help me mop it up.

353
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,820
我们越快离开这里越好
The sooner we get out of here the better.

354
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,130
哦！
Oh!

355
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,140
是手指！
It's a finger!

356
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,180
两只手指！
It's two fingers!

357
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,480
好 好 把它们拿走 在这等着
Okay, okay. Put 'em away and just wait here.

358
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,960
我去叫弗莱明过来
I'm gonna get this to Fleming.

359
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,020
残肢在哪儿？
Where are these body parts?

360
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,500
残肢？
The body parts?

361
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,820
我相信你 亲爱的 但是你确定它是活的？
No, I believe you, honey. Are you sure you it was alive?

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,920
因为我曾经在马戏团看到过一只美人鱼
Because I saw a mermaid once in a carnival tent.

363
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,270
结果只是一只猴子加了条鱼尾巴而已 当时真唬住我了
And it was a monkey sewn to the tail of a fish. Looked real to me.

364
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,790
好吧 我道歉
Alright, I apologized.

365
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,640
我赶时间
I have a deadline

366
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,560
你知道吗...
You know uh...

367
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,640
玉米片这种零食原本是用来防止手淫的
Corn Flakes were invented to prevent masturbation.

368
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,960
并不奏效
It didn't work.

369
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,100
哦 艾丽丝·费伊的节目开始了...
Oh, Alice Faye just started...

370
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,840
她是个大明星 巨星
She was a huge star, huge.

371
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,930
有一天她终于忍受不了圈子里的那些屁事儿和潜规则
And one day she couldn't take the bullshit, the backstabbing anymore

372
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,590
就头也不回地离开了那个圈子
and she just walked away from everything.

373
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,660
当垃圾来看的话 还算不错 是吧？
Ta-da! It's not bad, is it? For being shit?

374
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,400
听着 你吃完 就上床睡觉
Huh, listen. You eat, you go to bed, you rest.

375
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,470
等我拿到报酬后...
And when I get paid...

376
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,240
我们去吃派！不对 不是我们吃派
We get pie! No, we don't get pie.

377
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,100
是我吃派 你吃你想吃的
I get pie. You get whatever you want.

378
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,550
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

379

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,400
- 他们现在想要绿色的果冻 - 但他们之前告诉我要红色
- They want the gelatin to be green now. - But I was told red.

385
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,830
新理念 大势所趋
New concept. That's the future, now.

386
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,690
绿色
Green.

387
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,190
对了 他们还想让这个家庭看起来更快乐点
Oh. And they want them happier- the family.

388
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,130
更快乐 更快乐？
Happier. Happier?

389
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,460
这位父亲看起来像刚发现了传教士式体位(男上女下)
The Father looks like he just discovered the missionary position

390
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,080

391

好吧...他们还要怎么高兴?
Well uh... What would they supposed to be happy about?

392
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,120
客户想要照片 我说服了他们
The client want the photographs. I sold them on this

393
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,530
- 很遗憾 它是件好作品 - 它确实是 不是吗？
- It's too bad-this is nice work. - It is nice, isn't it?

394
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,260
我觉得它是我最好的作品了
I think it's one of my best.

395
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,360
你撑得住吧？
How are you holding up?

396
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,150
- 在喝酒吗？ - 不 滴酒不沾

你是指我被你辞退之后？
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

399
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,670
我现在不想谈论这个
We're not gonna get into this now.

400
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,120
我想回来 伯尼

401
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,720

00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,960
艾丽莎！
Elisa!

404
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,890
你在那里面干什么呢？
What are you doing in there?

清洁啊
Cleaning, huh?

410
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,550
差不多十年了 长官

411
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,790
你没有兄弟姐妹吗 泽尔达？
No siblings, Zelda?

412
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,370
没有 长官...
No sir...

413
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,420
对于你们这类人来说 这并不常见 是吗?
That's not common, is it? For your people?

414
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,790
我妈妈在生完我之后
My momma died after me.

415
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,330
就去世了
After I was born.

416
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,720
你名字里的“D”是什么意思？
What does the “D” stand for?

417
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,850
是黛利拉 长官
Delilah, Sir.

418
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,640
来自于圣经

在哄他入睡之后 剪去了他的头发

421
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,290
非利士人折磨并羞辱了他

422
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,520
还把他的眼睛挖了出来

423
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,270
看来我妈妈似乎并没有仔细读圣经
I guess my momma didn't read the good book close enough

424
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,200
那你呢？

艾丽莎·埃斯波西托

426
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,620
埃斯波西托不是“孤儿”的意思吗？
Doesn't Esposito means “Orphan”?

427
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,260
两位女士都是来自帕特南的可怜孤儿
Our Lady of Sorrows Orphanage in Putnam.

428
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,360
他们在河边的水里找到了她

429
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,100
是你...找到了我的手指？

噢！谢谢

431
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,130
三个小时的手术

433
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,150
也不知道是否能愈合
Don't know if it's going to take it or not.

434
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,220
上面还沾上了点儿芥末
There was mustard on them.

435
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,130
- 用一个纸袋子装？ - 当时只有这个能用了 长官
- A paper bag？ - It was all we had, Sir.

436
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,070
鉴于她不能说话 大部分都是我来回答
I answer mostly, on account that she can't talk.

437
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,450
她不能说话？她是聋子吗？
She can't? Is she deaf?

438
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,690
是哑巴 长官
Mute, sir.

439
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,530
她说她能听到你
She said she can hear you.

440
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,620
你脖子上的那些伤疤
All those scars on your neck.

441
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,760
原来是伤到了你的声带 对吗？
That's what that it cut your voice box, right?

442
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,590
她说从她还是婴儿的时候就是哑巴了
She said since she was a baby.

443
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,320
谁会那样对待一个婴儿？
Who would do that to a baby?

444
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,660
这个世界充满了罪恶 不是吗 黛利拉？
The world is sinful. Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

445
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,890
好了 我不废话了
Well, let me say this upfront.

446
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,950
你们打扫那个实验室 然后离开
You clean that lab. You get out.

447
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,070
我们保存在那儿的那个东西 是个耻辱
The thing we keep in there, is an affront.

448
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,130
你知道什么是耻辱吗 泽尔达？
Do you know what an affront is, Zelda?

449
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,210
令人反感的东西？
Something offensive?

450
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,900
没错 告诉你 我把那个...
That's right. And I should know, I've dragged that...

451
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,110
肮脏的东西
...filthy thing

452
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,690
从南美洲的沼泽地里一路拉到这里
out of the river muck in South America all the way here

453
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,740
并且路上我们都相处地不怎么愉快
And along the way we didn't get to like each other much.

454
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,970
现在
Now.

455
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,760
你们可能会认为...那个东西看起来像人
You may think... that thing looks human

456
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,810
用两条腿站立 对吗？
Stands on two legs, right?

457
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,790
但是...神 是按照自己的模样 创造人类的
But... we're created in the Lord's image.

458
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,750
你该不会觉得上帝就是长那样吧？
You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?

459
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,690
先生 我不知道上帝长什么样
I wouldn't know, Sir. What the Lord looks like.

460
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,640
人的样子 泽尔达 上帝长得像人 像我一样
Well, human, Zelda. He looks like a human, like me.

461
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,000
或者像你
Or even you.

462
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,210
我觉得可能长得更像我一点
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

463
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,550
好 就这样吧
Well, that's all.

464
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,100
霍伊特将军 感谢您的回电
General Hoyt. Thank you for calling me back, Sir.

465
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,130
- 你好点儿了吗？- 是的 将军 好多了
- You feel better? - Oh yes, Sir. Much better.

466
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,490
多亏了止痛药
Pain pills, is all.

467
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,130
- 你被弄断了两根手指头 是这样吗？ - 没错 两根手指头
- You lost two fingers. You wasn't? - Two fingers yeah. He got two fingers.

468
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,910
但是我的大拇指 食指 中指都还健在
But I still got my thumb, my trigger and my pussy finger

469
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,760
听起来你应该没事了 - 是的 将军
Sounds to me like you'll be all right. - Yes, sir, that's right.

470
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,640
期待您日后大驾光临 将军
Looking forward to your visit, Sir.

471
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,290
项目的事还需要您来作决策
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

472
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,600
...位于朴次茅斯市中心地段
...free to locations on Downtown Portermouth.

473
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,360
坐拥未来之地
The Future is here.

474
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,070
去休息吧
Get to rest.

475
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,280
9点30来接我
Pick me up on 9:30.

476
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,540
21点30分 知道了 先生
Twenty one hundred and thirty hours. Yes, Sir.

477
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,050
...买不了吃亏买不了上当
...that's great to buy.

478
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,770
我回来了
I'm home.

479
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,120
我给你做了一个煎蛋卷
I made you an omelet!

480
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,330
- 爸爸！告诉你件事情 - 没有煎饼？
- Hey Dad! Guess what? - No pancakes?

481
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,180
我把家里的箱子翻了个底朝天 就是找不到平底锅
I've gone half through the boxes. I can't find the griddle...

482
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,880
- 我就给你做了个奶酪西兰花煎蛋饼 - 告诉你件事情
- I made you cheese and broccoli omelette, - Guess what?

483
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,220
你怎么样了？疼吗？
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

484
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,450
- 有一点 止疼药管点儿用 - 告诉你件事情
- A little bit. Pills help. - Guess what?

485
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,860
- 什么? - 我们埋了一个时间胶囊 就在新学校那
- What? - We're burying a time capsule, at the new school.

486
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,300
我想问你
I wanted to ask you.

487
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,690
我们未来真的会有喷气式背包出现吗？
Do you think we'll all have jet packs, in the future?

488
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,440
- 一定会有的 孩子 - 公交车来了
- Believe it son. - Bus is here.

489
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,260
这里是美国
This is America.

490
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,000
再见 爸爸！
Bye dad!

491
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,060
赶紧吃完蛋卷 洗完手到楼上来 亲爱的
Finish your omelet and wash your hands real good and come upstairs, Sweetie.

492
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,860
我还挺喜欢这里的
I kinda like it here.

493
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,750
孩子们喜欢草坪 华盛顿离这里也就半个小时的路程
The kids like the lawn. Plus, DC is just half an hour away, isn't it?

494
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,860
不管怎么说 这里是巴尔的摩 伊莲 没有人喜欢这里
It's still Baltimore, Elaine. No one likes Baltimore.

495
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,320
你知道我是怎么想的吗？
You know what I'm thinking?

496
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,010
我觉得 我需要一辆新车
I'm thinking. I need a new car.

497
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,850
需要一辆新车是吗？
Do you need a new car, do you?

498
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,360
凯迪拉克怎么样 先生？
How about a Cadillac, Mr.?

499
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,510
理查德
Richard.

500
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,930
噢
Oh.

501
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,220
噢
Oh

502
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,980
噢 理查德！
Oh, Richard!

503
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,530
亲爱的 亲爱的 亲爱的 你的手在流血
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. Your hand is bleeding.

504
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,980
安静 别说话
Silence. Don't talk. I want you in silence.

505
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,240
安静
Silence.

506
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,560
安静
Silence.

507
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,700
麻雀窝中睡
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

508
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,340
什么？
What?

509
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,760
麻雀窝中睡
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

510
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,160
魂断猎鹰喙
And the eagle takes the prey.

511
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,860
什么？
What?

512
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,560
鲍勃！
Bob!

513
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,470
艾丽莎！快点！快点！过来
Elisa! Hurry! Hurry! Come on.

514
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,630
快打卡 上帝啊 姑娘
Swipe it. God, girl.

515
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,720
- 你又这样 泽尔达 - 噢 你老人家歇口气吧 约兰达！
- You're doing it again, Zelda. - Oh. Give it a rest, Yolanda!

516
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,430
- 嘿 泽尔达 来一支不 - 吸烟有害健康 杜安
- Hey, Zelda, you want to smoke? - That shit's ain't good for you, Duane.

517
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,670
没错 但是一天不抽心发慌
Yeah. But it feel good.

518
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,000
那倒是真的 不是吗？
It does, doesn't it?

519
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,800
来嘛 艾丽莎 就一支
C'mon Elisa, just one.

520
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,560
来嘛 来嘛 来嘛
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon

521
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,050
别担心那些摄像头
Don't worry about that camera.

522
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,730
我们在休息时间都把它挪开了
We push them off on break time.

523
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,780
嗯哼
Uh- mm

524
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,430
这里是个视角盲点
This here's a blind spot.

525
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,990
我可能要在这里完成一些事情 请将军过来 行吗？
I may have to finish some things in here, fetch the General, will ya?

526
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,360
噢 你想我了？
Oh. You miss me, huh?

527
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,370
我带了一包水果糖
I took a candy break.

528
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,810
你怕这个啊？
This is what scares you, huh?

529
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,720
那我就用这个吧
Jeez, be used to it by now.

530
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,710
又来了！发出那种炸耳朵的声音
There you go again. Making that god- awful sound.

531
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,380
是在哭吗？叫什么？
Is that you crying, huh? Is that what it is?

532
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,460
你疼么？啊？
Are you hurting? Huh?

533
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,430
或者说你很愤怒？
Or maybe you're angry?

534
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,130
或者说你还想再咬我一口
Maybe you'd like to get another bite at me.

535
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,310
啊？来啊
Huh? Go ahead.

536
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,450
你还真敢啊
I can't tell.

537
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,520
你在求饶吗？
Are you begging?

538
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,220
对于我来说 这是我听过最难听的噪音
'Cause to me it's just the worst fucking noise I've ever heard.

539
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:19,920
艾丽莎？
Elisa?

540
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:21,900
艾丽莎！
Elisa!

541
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,360
霍伊特将军！欢迎光临！
General Hoyt! Welcome, Sir!

542
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,460
一切都准备就绪 很荣幸您能来这 将军！
Everything's ready. Glad to have you here, Sir!

543
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,320
- 见到你很高兴 小伙子 - 谢谢
- Good to see you, son. - Thank you.

544
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,630
我的老天 就是这个吗？
Good God Almighty, Is that it?

545
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,750
比我想象中要大
A lot bigger than I thought.

546
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,980
奇丑无比
Ugly as sin.

547
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,740
你知道吗 亚马逊土著把这玩意儿当神来供着
You know, the natives in the Amazon worshipped it as a God.

548
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,260
我倒是真看不出来这是个什么神
It doesn't look like much of a God now, does it?

549
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,640
嗯 他们是原始人 将军
Well, they were primitive, Sir. You know they tossed offerings

550
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,110
他们都用些花啊草啊水果什么的当供品
into the water, flowers, fruits, crap like that.

551
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,430
他们还想用弓箭阻止我们石油开采
Then they tried to stop the oil drill with bows and arrows.

552
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,840
他们的下场可不太妙
That didn't turn out too well.

553
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,290
他在流血 怎么回事？
He's bleeding. What happened?

554
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,840
怎么回事？
What happened?

555
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,040
它就是个畜生 霍夫斯德勒 不用管它
It's an animal, Hoffstetler. Just keeping it tame.

556
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,510
“氧气的渗透作用与二氧化碳的置换”
“Oxygen osmosis and dioxide exchange.”

557
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,610
- 为什么要抓来这玩意？- 这个物种 长官
- What the hell we got here, Son? - This creature, Sir

558
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,090
可以在两个独立的呼吸系统之间转换
It can alternate between two entirely separate breathing mechanisms.

559
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,310
- 弹涂鱼也能做到 - 不
- Mudskipper can do that. - No.

560
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,570
如果你想把人送进太空
Look. You want to put a man in space.

561
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,060
他必须要适应 人类不能适应的各种环境
He's gonna have to endure conditions the human body just wasn't made for.

562
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,510
在我们同苏联人的太空竞赛中 这能让我们占上风
This gives us an edge against the Soviets.

563
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,460
他在空气中能存活多久?
How long can it breathe outside the water?

564
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,570
事实上 长官 我们并不了解这东西
Reality, is, Sir. We don't know jackshit about this thing.

565
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,490
我们都知道 苏联人想研究它
Well, the Soviets want it. We know that much.

566
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,160
那些混蛋
Those cockeyed bastards.

567
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,220
他们把狗送进太空 我们可以嘲笑他们
You know, they let them send a dog up in the space and we get a good laugh.

568
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,670
但是紧接着他们 把人也送上去了
Then next thing you know, they send a human up.

569
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,120
一个卫星绕着地球飞 天知道在搞些什么阴谋诡计
A Ruskie, orbiting our planet, doing God knows what?

570
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,670
现在轮到 赫鲁晓夫笑了
Who's laughing now? Krushchev.

571
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,980
他们送狗上了太空 他开心了 接着把一个苏联混蛋送上天
That's it. We let him put a dog in space, he laughs, puts a commie in space

572
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,620
他又笑了 然后他向古巴发射了导弹
he laughs, puts missiles in Cuba.

573
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,540
我们啥也没学到
Have we learned nothing?

574
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,540
长官 我要把它放回水中
Sir. We need to get him back in the water

575
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,550
你看这些科学家 他们就像艺术家 爱上了他们的玩物
See this Scientist, they are like artists. They fall in love with their playthings.

576
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,110
这里 长官 看这里
Now, right here-you see? Along the middle?

577
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,180
这个生物有一块厚实的关节软骨组织 将主要和次要肺分开了
This creature has a thick jointed cartilage separating the primary and secondary lungs.

578
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,940
我说得对吧 鲍勃?
Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?

579
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,180
- 是的 但是我们必须要... - 光拍X光片是不够的
- Yes, but we have to... - It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

580
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,850
- 理论上是的 长官 但我们要先... - 如果我们要打败苏联人
- In principle, Sir, yes but... - If we want to get the edge on the Soviets

581
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,470
- 我们应该 解刨这个东西 - 不 不行
- we need to vivisect this thing. - No, no, no.

582
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,140
- 解剖它 从里到外研究 - 不能这样
- Take it apart. Learn how it works. - No.

583
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,250
不 不行  那不是我们的初衷
No. That would defeat the purpose

584
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,150
长官 他晕过去了 救救他吧
Sir? He's passed out. Please.

585
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,590
把它放进罐子里 给他加压
Put him in the tank. Let him pressurize.

586
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,780
霍伊特将军
General Hoyt, sir!

587
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,980
在任何情况下 您都不能杀死这个生物
You cannot, under any circumstance, kill this creature.

588
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,150
数数这些星星 小伙子 一共有五个!
Count these with me, Son. There's five of them.

589
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,910
这证明我可以 为所欲为
That means I can do whatever the hell I want.

590
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,060
如果你想聊你的研究 我会听你说完
You wanna plead your case? I'll listen to it.

591
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,920
但最后.. 是我下决定
But, end of the day, it is my damn decision.

592
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,250
把那该死的玩意剖开
Crack the damn thing open.

593
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,300
仔细研究研究 结束任务了
Lean what you can and close up shot.

594
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,740
好好休息一下 斯特里克兰
And give yourself a good pat on the back, Strickland.

595
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,690
- 就这样吧 - 谢谢 长官
- You've done it. - Thank you sir.

596
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,340
现在快点开始吧 小伙子
Now hurry up and finish this job, son.

597
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,820
马上开始 长官
Absolutely, sir.

598
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,880
救他出来? 你在想些什么?
Get him out? What are you talking?

599
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,590
不 绝对不行
No! Absolutely not!

600
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,580
因为这是犯法! 这就是原因
Because it's breaking the law! And that's what.

601
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,960
可能连谈论它 都犯法了
We're probably breaking the law, just talking about it.

602
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,610
"他很孤独!" 是么
Oh, he's alone. Oh.

603
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,490
那我们每次去中餐馆吃饭
This mean that... whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant

604
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,200
你都要解救浴缸里的每条鱼么?
you want to save every fish in the tank?

605
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,500
所以他孤单又怎么样呢? 我们都孤单
So what if he's alone? We're all alone.

606
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,170
"它是我见过最孤单的东西"
It's the loneliest thing you've ever seen

607
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,880
好吧 你自己都说了
Well you just said it, right? You just said it.

608
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,980
你说他是个“东西”他是个怪胎
You called it a thing. It's a thing. It's a freak.

609
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,790
我明白你的意思
I can understand you.

610
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,470
冷静 我的天 冷静
Calm down! God, calm down!

611
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,960
好吧 我重复说一遍
Alright. I will... I will repeat it to you.

612
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:53,830
“我是什么?”
"What I am?

613
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,880
我张开嘴巴 和他一样
I move my mouth, like him.

614
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,130
我发不出任何声音 和他一样
I make no sound, like him.

615
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,420
那又如何?
What does that make me?

616
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,020
现在我的一切 和我所经历的
All that I am, all that I've ever been

617
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,480
都把我 引向他
Brought me here to him.

618
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,660
你用的是“他” 现在改称"他" 了吗?
You see, you're saying "him". It's a "him" now.

619
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,340
这...
It's a...

620
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,210
你打到我了!
You just hit me!

621
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,930
艾丽莎 放开我
Elisa, let go of me.

622
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,160
我听着呢 你从来没打过我！
I'm looking, I'm looking. You've never... hit me!

623
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,060
"当他看向我的时候 他看着我的方式
When he looks at me, the way he looks at me.

624
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,930
他并不觉得我缺少什么
He does not know what I lack.

625
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,920
也不会觉得我是不完整的
Or how I am incomplete.

626
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:59,060
他看到的我 是真实的我
He sees me for what I am, as I am.

627
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,010
他见到我很快乐
He's happy to see me

628
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,790
每天 每次见到他 都是如此
Every time, every day.

629
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,910
现在 我要么救他
And now I can either save him...

630
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,840
要么让他死去 "
...or let him die.

631
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,730
我要走了 我必须离开了
I'm leaving. I have to... no I have to leave.

632
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,070
艾丽莎 住手! 听我说
Just Elisa, please stop! Listen to me. Just listen to me.

633
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,580
我要走了 我现在必须离开
I have to go! I'm leaving now because this...

634
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,700
艾丽莎 这对我很重要 这是我第二次机会!
Elisa, this is very important to me. This is a second chance for me!

635
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,440
对不起 但我得走
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

636
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,840
当我回来的时候 我们再也不要讨论这个了
And when I come back. We will not talk about this, ever again.

637
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,640
艾丽莎... 够了
Elisa... there's... Alright. Alright.

638
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,170
我们是什么 你和我算什么? 我们没办法!
What are we? What are you and I? What we are? We are nothing!

639
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,650
我们一点办法都没有
Nothing. We can't do nothing!

640
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,440
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

641
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,650
但这...它...
But this-this-this is just...

642
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,220
根本不是人类!
Oh god! He's not even human!

643
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,610
我的天
God.

644
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,180
什么
What?

645
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,470
吉尔斯!
Giles!

646
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,600
- 我在等你 - 我知道 对不起
- I've been waiting. - I know, sorry.

647
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,170
没关系
It's okay.

648
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,140
进去谈吗?
We going in?

649
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,640
你把画寄过来就好
You should've just mailed the art.

650
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,840
不 我想亲自给你和你的团队看
No! I wanted to show you it to you and the team and person

651
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,210
这是我的杰作
It's some of my best work.

652
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,400
已经不能更绿了！
And this green as can be!

653
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,350
这个...
It's uh...

654
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,610
现在好像不太合适 也许以后再谈吧
It's not a good time. Maybe later.

655
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,320
好吧 没问题
Oh well, sure, no problem.

656
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,510
你什么时间合适呢 伯尼?
What would be good time for you, Bernie?

657
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,500
这是你画的吗？
You painted that?

658
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,870
是啊
Yeah.

659
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,410
哇！你可真棒！
Wow! You're good!

660
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:21,260
不过没有照片那样逼真
Apparently, not as good as a photograph.

661
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,390
但也不错了 是吗？
But it's good, isn't it, huh?

662
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,500
反正我画不出来
Pfft. I couldn't paint like that.

663
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,580
来吧 我请了
Here. On me.

664
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:29,980
给我的？
For me?

665
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,690
我们这没有多少你这样的人 你看起来...
We don't get many like you in here. You seem...

666
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,230
很有教养 我喜欢跟你聊天
very educated. I like talking to you.

667
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,870
事实上...嗯...
The thing is... That's the...

668
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,470
我来这的原因是...
The only reason that I come in here is...

669
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,630
是来聊天的 而且这派味道真不错 是吗？
The conversation. And the pie is mighty fine too, isn't it?

670
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,580
嗯 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

671
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,270
没加柠檬 但是很美味
It's no key lime. But it's good.

672
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,240
是这样的 我独自一人工作
You know, I work alone. And uh...

673
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,340
我最好的朋友不怎么喜欢聊天
my best friend is not much of a conversationalist.

674
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,710
知道吗？聊天也是在这工作的一部分
You see? That's part of being on the job here.

675
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,260
比如做个调酒师
It's like being a bartender.

676
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,340
你为客人做馅饼 倾听他们的故事 慢慢了解他们
You serve people pie, you listen to their problems. Get to know them.

677
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,890
我想要更了解你
I'd like to get to know you better.

678
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,440
你在干嘛 老家伙？
- What the hell are you doing, old man?

679
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,440
噢 抱歉
Whoa. Oh- oh.

680
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,800
嘿！别坐吧台 把东西打包带走 你们不能坐这
Hey! No- no- no. Not the counter. Take out only. You can't sit there.

681
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,850
你们想要什么 就点好 然后打包带走
You want something, you order, you take it out.

682
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,650
但店里很空啊 吧台...
But it's empty... The counter is-

683
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,960
有人预订了 订了一整天 你不能在这坐
All reserved. All day. You don't sit down.

684
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,140
欢迎再来啊 听见了吗？
Y'all come back now, Y'hear?

685
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,990
你没必要这样跟他们说话
You don't need to talk to them like that.

686
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,420
你也该走了
You should go, too.

687
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,870
别再来了 这里是家庭餐厅
And don't come back. This is a family restaurant.

688
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,890
我找不到其他人聊天了
I have no one.

689
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,590
你是唯一一个能听我说话的人
And you're the only person that I can talk to.

690
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:06,930
听着
Now.

691
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,100
你想要什么都可以
Whatever this thing is

692
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,080
只要你说需要
You need it.

693
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:13,320
那么
So...

694
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,200
你只需要告诉我该怎么做就行
You just tell me what to do.

695
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,170
- “所有往事...” - “春日已逝”
- "All those things..." - "As the spring recedes..."

696
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,510
走吧
Let's go!

697
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,170
凯迪拉克帝威 世界上最好的车

You know, I can't figure it out myself. You're not much to look at.

我们照样杀了他们 不是么？
And we still kill them, don't we?

772
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:09,860
关键是 这里不是动物园
The bottom line is, this is not a petting zoo.

长官 霍伊特将军在等您的电话
Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.

833
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,810
那个两栖人对我们来说就像太空狗一样珍贵 斯特里克兰
That thing was our Space Dog, Strickland.

834
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:00,820
你知道的
You know that.

835
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,160
先生 我会把他抓回来的
Sir, I'm gettin' it back.

836
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:06,800
我没有-我不能再往坏处想了 先生
I don't-I can't be in a negative frame of mind, Sir.

837
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,140
所以你感觉很好么？
So you're feeling good?

838
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,320
我有信心 把他抓回来
Feeling strong. Getting it back

839
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:15,620
你能搞定的 必须把它抓回来 为了我 你能办到的下伙子
You can get it done. You're gonna get it done. For me, Son. For me.

840
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,160
你计划那天放他走吗？
Is that when you're planning on releasing him?

841
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,870
十号？
On the tenth?

842
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:04,410
如果降雨推迟了呢？
So what if the rains are late?

843
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,060
水道会怎么样？
What happens with the canal?

844
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:08,850
好吧
All right.

845
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,380
那是什么？
What's that?

846
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:16,560
让我看看
Let me see it.

847
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,190

Is that for me?

848
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,210
这很好 你继续保持
That's good, keep it up.

849
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,290
看起来你还什么都不知道呢
Lookin' like you don't know anything.

850
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,240
如果他们来找我的麻烦了 请上帝保佑我
Lord help me if they ask me if I do.

851
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,480
我不太会撒谎
I am not a good liar.

852
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,910
对布鲁斯特除外
Except for Brewster.

853
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,360
为了维持婚姻我撒了很多谎
Takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going.

854
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,620
所有人员请注意

你让我们惹上大麻烦了！
You got us in trouble!

861
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,430
在我看来 我们面对的一个受过高度训练的组织 先生
In my opinion, we are looking at a highly trained group, Sir.

862
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:35,670
长官 我觉得是特种部队之类的
I'm thinking, conceivably, Sir. Special Forces and so on and so forth.

863
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,220
苏军特种部队？
Red Army Special forces?

864
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,200
八九不离十
Conceivably.

865
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:42,540
一个受过高度训练 经费充足的精英组织
A highly-trained, well-financed, elite group.

866
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,810
高效率 残忍的 工作极其精准
Highly efficient, ruthless, clockwork precision.

867
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:48,050
潜入行动不到五分钟就结束了 先生
Infiltration took less than five minutes, Sir.

868
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,340
我怎么都觉得要花上十分钟才能完成行动吧
I can sure the estimate of this Strict Force of at least 10 minutes.

869
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:08,520
你一直是一个人呆着吗？
Have you always been alone?

870
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,010
你有过朋友吗？
Did you ever have someone?

871
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:18,800
你知道你发生了什么吗？你知道吗？
Do you know what happened to you? Do you?

872
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,020
因为我不知道 我不知道我身上发生了什么
'Cause I don't. I don't know what happen to me.

873
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,320
我不知道
I don't know.

874
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,410
我照镜子 唯一能认出的就是那双眼睛了
I look in the mirror, the only thing that I recognize are these eyes.

875
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,300
长在一个老男人的脸上
In this old man's face.

876
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:39,550
有时我觉得我生的太早 有时又觉得生的太晚了
And sometimes I think I was either both too early or too late for my life.

877
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:44,800
可能我们俩都是老古董吧
Maybe we're both just relics.

878
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:01,910
先生 我找到他们了
Sir? I got them.

879
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,020
泽尔达 艾丽莎 请进
Zelda, Elisa. Come in.

880
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,870
看来在事情发生之前 你们俩已经打卡下班了

如果你们知道关于一些泄露物的信息

你们有义务去报告所有的细节

884
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,890
无论这些细节多么的微不足道
No matter how small or trivial it may seem.

885
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,650
“微不足道”的意思是“不重要”
"Trivial" means "unimportant".

886
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,240
我没发现有什么反常的 没有
I didn't seem nothin' out of the ordinary. No.

你看到他进出过这个实验室吗？
Did either of you see him coming in or out of the lab?

892
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,050
他在这儿工作 不是吗？
He works there, doesn't he?

893
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,050
我说的是另一个意思
I mean in a different way.

894

做一些不寻常的事情
Doing something different.

895
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,480
你是说微不足道的那种事么 没有 先生
Something trivial? No sir.

896
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,170
我在这儿干什么？
What am I doing?

897
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,520
我居然询问你们这些家伙
Interviewing the fucking help...

The shit cleaners...

01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,100
你们两个走吧 离开这儿
You two, go ahead. Leave.

901
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:49,560
你跟我说什么？
What did you say to me?

902
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:57,540
- 她说什么？-我不知道
- What did she say? - I didn't catch it.

903
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:03,820
- 他说什么？- 她说“谢谢你”

905
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:57,370
我们要做的只有一件事了

907
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,530

No! No!

908
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:55,220
我想早点回家
I want to get home early.

909
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:59,310
最近布鲁斯特很爱生气...
Brewster has been in a bad mood lately...

910
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,590
圣主耶稣！
Holy Jesus!

911
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:06,000
你躲在女士更衣室干什么？
What are you doing standing in the shadows of the women's locker room??

912
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,100
他们可能一直在看着我 这儿应该没有摄像机
They may be watching me, and there are no cameras here/

913
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,190
理由不错嘛
For good reason.

914
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,090
你在这个时候见我们是有何贵干？
What if you caught us in an inconvenient moment?

915
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,940

917
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,690
当雨水将连接大海的水道填满的时候
When the rain fills the canal that flows to the sea.

918
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,640
如果你需要任何帮助

919
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:25,810
放了它 赶紧的
Release him. Soon.

920

它跑了 这不是他的错
He ate Pandora, it wasn't his fault.

928

他是一个野生动物

929
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,360
我们不能要求它做其他任何事情

930
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:08,500
艾莉莎 去找他 快去！

我一直在努力保持清醒
I stayed awake as long as I could

934
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,120
但毕竟我不是年轻人了
But I'm not even a young man anymore.

935
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,240
他还好么？你确定么？
Is he alright? You sure?

936
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,840
你要去哪儿？ 别 别

我不生气
I'm not angry.

940

是么？
Really?

949
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:36,920
那挺好的
That's good to hear.

950
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:39,850
你从加尔维斯顿调过来
You joined us in Galveston.

951
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,620
- 但你之前在哪里工作呢 霍夫斯德勒？- 博士
- But where were you before, Hoffstetler? - Doctor.

952
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,450
- 什么？- 请叫我
- Excuse me? - Doctor.

953
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:45,650
霍夫斯德勒博士
Hoffstetler.

954
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,040
这是规矩
Protocol.

955
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:53,780
- 我之前在威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校 - 那就对了
- Wisconsin. Madison. - That's right.

956
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,270
你放弃了终身教职 对吧？
You gave up a tenure track position. Didn't you?

957
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,120
为了我们
Gave it all up...

958
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,080
什么都不要了
For us.

959
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:06,700
那么 我想你现在已经准备好离开我们了 对吗？
I suppose you're getting ready to leave us now, then, huh?

960
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,660
如果找不到那个生物的话 是的
Only if the creature isn't found.

961
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,400
你想什么呢？ 你真以为我们能找到它？
What do you think? You think we will find it?

962
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,750
噢 你说过你们有进展了
Well, you said you had a lead.

963
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,070

01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,980
亲爱的 你在傻笑什么？
Why you smiling, hon?

965
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,410
别这副表情好嘛
Stop looking like that.

966
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,270
你俩干嘛啦？
What happened?

967
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,290
怎么可能？
Why?

968
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:26,900
他？
How?

969
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,010
他怎么做到的？
How?

970
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,940
他他他他有那东西？
Does he? Have a?

971
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:39,630
这样
Mmm.

972
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:42,330
再这样打开 就长出来了嘛
Mmm.

973
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,310
永远别以为男人很单纯
Never trust a man.

974
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,100
即使他那里光秃秃空荡荡平平无奇
Even when he looks flat down there.

975
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,570
我刚报名参加了一个人类学课程
I just signed up in anthropology.

976
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,900
我们全班都要去亚马逊雨林
We're gonna go have classes in the Amazon Jungle...

977
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,550
- 在南美洲 - 南美洲？
- in South America. - South America?

978
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,620
哦天哪 那可得大清早就出发
Oh man. You have to get off early in the morning

979
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:12,440
那地方很远的
That's a long hike.

980
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,290
- 我们要待在那儿 - 我们？
- We're gonna stay down there. - We are?

981
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,050
哦 不 你该不会也要去吧
Oh no. You're not coming along too.

982
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:20,630
尝尝这个吉利丁冻糕
This is a gelatin parfait.

983
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,610
你会爱上这个味道的
You will love it.

984
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,290
爸爸 我们能看《伯南扎的牛仔》吗？
Dad, can we watch Bonanza?

985
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:27,660
那对你们来说太暴力了 你知道我今天在想什么吗？
Bonanza is much too violent. You know what I was thinking today?

986
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:28,990
我们带着孩子
We get the kids a P-U-P-P...

987
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:23,220
怎么回事？ 这水都涌进我的电影院啦
What is going on? I've got water pouring into my theater.

988
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,710
有四个付了钱的观众 我还得给他们退票
I have four paying customers. I can't afford a refund.

989
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,140
可能是某个管道的问题 我会处理的
It's probably a pipe. I'll take care of it.

990
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:29,170
- 修不好就别住这里了 - 我会修好的
- If you don't fix it. No more renting. - I will fix it.

991
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:48,820
艾丽莎！
Elisa!

992
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,500
我的天哪！
Dear God!

993
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:52,580
艾丽莎！
Elisa!

994
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,990
我在擦干我的头发
I'm toweling my hair.

995
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:26,380
我的头发！
It's my hair!

996
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:32,040
还有 看看我的手臂 那些伤口
And... and... look at the arm. The wound.

997
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:34,170
好像从来没有过一样 太神奇了
As if it was never there. Look at them.

998
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,390
你说过 人们把他当成神一样供奉着
You said... He was worshipped like a god.

999
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,680
他是上帝吗？ 我不这么觉得 他可是吃了一只猫
Is he a God? I don't look to him as a God. He ate a cat

1000
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,570
哎 我真不知道
So I-I don't know! I don't know!

1001
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:45,260
我们得让他多留一阵子
We have to keep him around, awhile

1002
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,690
就一阵子
A little while.

1003
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,160
喂？
Hello?

1004
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:50,880
你的水 长官
Your water, Sir.

1005
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,670
- 还有 长官 霍伊特将军找你 - 不 别接通
- And, Sir, General Hoyt. - Uh-mm. Uh-mm.

1006
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,100
告诉他我不在 我会打给他 总之别接进来
Tell him I'm not in, tell him I will call him back. Don't put him through.

1007
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,410
不是来电 长官 他已经在你办公室里了
No, Sir. He's in your office.

1008
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,780
现在我们唯一关心的就是那个研究对象
At this point our only concern is the asset.

1009
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:08,910
你找到它了吗？
Do you have it?

1010
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,780
还在找 长官
Still in the wind, sir.

1011
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:12,950
那可不好
That won't do.

1012
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:15,340
嗯 我知道
Yes sir. I know.

1013
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,450
你认识我多久了 长官？
You've know me for how long, Sir?

1014
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,570
- 十三年了 釜山战役就认识了 - 是的 长官
- Thirteen years. Battle of Pusan. - Yes, sir.

1015
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:27,660
一个男人尽其一生都是有信仰 忠诚 做事高效的
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient all of his life. All of it

1016
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:30,390
还很有能力
And he is... useful.

1017
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,220
而他期望...
And he expects...

1018
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,430
他当然想要一定的回报
He has certain expectations in return.

1019
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:40,780
但是 他失败了
And then... He fails.

1020
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,770
一次 仅此一次
Once. Only once.

1021
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:43,940
那会导致什么？
What does that make?

1022
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,060
会让他变成失败者吗？
Does that make him a failure?

1023
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:53,810
当一个男人完成任务 来证明他自己 将军
When is a man done, Sir? Proving himself?

1024
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:55,870
他是一个好人
A good man.

1025
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,290
一个体面的人
A decent man.

1026
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,090
体面？
Decent?

1027
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,750
一个体面的人不会把事情搞砸
A man must have the decency not to fuck up.

1028
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:13,420
这是一种体面
That's one thing.

1029
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,110
真正的体面
That is real decent of him.

1030
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:20,250
另一种体面嘛 其实并不重要
The other kind of decency. It doesn't really matter.

1031
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,400
我们摒弃它 不是因为我们没有这种品质
We sell it. But it's an export.

1032
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,730
而是因为它对我们没用
We sell it 'cause we don't use it.

1033
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:32,440
36小时以后 这一切就结束了
36 hours from now, this entire episode will be over.

1034
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,700
你也一样会完蛋
And so will you.

1035
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:41,510
我们的世界将会出现一个破洞
Our universe will have a hole in it with your outline.

1036
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,880
你会去另一个世界
And you will have moved on to an alternate universe.

1037
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,080
一个糟透了的世界
A universe of shit.

1038
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,700
你会被淹没在那文明里
You will be lost to civilization.

1039
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,740
未诞生
And you will be unborn.

1040
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:02,270
未成形
Unmade.

1041
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:05,800
未存在
Undone.

1042
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:15,290
所以 去挣些真正的体面吧 小伙子
So, go get some real decency, Son.

1043
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:18,310
然后收拾好这堆烂摊子
And unfuck this mess.

1044
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,300
36个小时
Thirty-six hours.

1045
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:57,270
36小时
Thirty-six hours.

1046
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,200
送快递 你送快递的！
Deliver. You deliver.

1047
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,070
你就是个送快递的！
That's what you do. You deliver, right?

1048
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:02,380
对吧！
Right?!

1049
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,610
你
You'll...

1050
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,320
永远
never...

1051
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:20,500
不会知道
know...

1052
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,990
我有多么
Just how much...

1053
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:28,140
多么
I've...

1054
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:29,870
爱
loved...

1055
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,490
你
you...

1056
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,380
你 永远
You'll...

1057
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,340
不会知道
Never know...

1058
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,670
我有多么
Just how much...

1059
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:48,180
♫ 在乎你 ♫
I care... 

1060
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,080
♫ 就算我不告诉你 ♫
And if I tried

1061
01:39:53,740 --> 01:40:01,480
♫ 我也没法掩饰我对你的深情 ♫
I still couldn't hide my love for you.

1062
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,910
♫ 你得知道 ♫
You ought to know

1063
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:09,370
♫ 我只是不告诉你 ♫
For haven't I told you so

1064
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:24,750
♫ 你走了 把我的心也带走了 ♫
You went away and my heart went with you

1065
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:35,260
♫ 我为你祷告 ♫
I speak your name in my every prayer

1066
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:43,220
♫ 我该怎么向你证明  我有多么爱你 ♫
If there is some other way to prove That I love you

1067
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:47,680
我无法向你诉说
I swear I don't know how.

1068
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:51,570
你不会明白的
You'll never know

1069
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:58,790
你怎么会明白
If you don't know now

1070
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:19,620
艾丽莎
Elisa.

1071
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,470
怎么啦 宝贝？
What is it, my honey?

1072
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:51,880
情况不妙啊
This isn't good.

1073
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:56,780
我要把霍夫斯德勒博士喊来了
I'm going to call Dr. Hoffstetler

1074
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,540
你今晚就得放走它了 宝贝
You got to release him tonight, honey.

1075
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,630
我会回来帮你的
I'll come back and help you.

1076
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:28,450
他要出来了
He's coming out.

1077
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:37,080
呃
Ugh.

1078
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,850
先生 恕我直言
Sir, If you don't mind me saying.

1079
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:44,560
您看起来不太好啊
You don't look so well.

1080
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,140
闭嘴
Shut up.

1081
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,390
你闻到了吗
Can you smell that?

1082
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:54,540
是你的手指 都黑掉了
I think it's your fingers. They are black.

1083
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:03,500
哦他来了 狗屁博士
There he is, Doctor fucking shitbird.

1084
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,570
先生 你这说的太难听了
There's no call for cursing, Sir.

1085
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,070
给我滚出来 这车归我了
Get out of the car. I'm taking it.

1086
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:15,680
- 这是我的车 快他妈给我滚出去
- This is my car. - Get the fuck out.

1087
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,350
- 这可是我的车 - 你听不见我说话嘛？
- Out of my car? - Did I stutter?

1088
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:57,820
- 哎妈 幸好 斯特里克兰 - 你又讲俄语了 鲍勃
- Strickland, thank God! - You were speaking Russian, Bob.

1089
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,470
- 你叫什么名字 - 霍夫斯德勒
- What's your name? - Hoffstetler.

1090
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:15,640
哎呀 这时候就没必要说假话了
Oh no. Don't lie. You don't need to.

1091
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,680
你肚子上可是中了一枪
You took a bullet to your gut.

1092
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,100
你离死不远了
You're dead.

1093
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:22,940
我要突击队里所有人的名字 军衔和藏身位置
I need the names, ranks and locations of the entire Strike Team.

1094
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:25,150
突击队？
Strike Team?

1095
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,480
抢走我们研究对象的那伙人
The ones that took the asset.

1096
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:41,760
这个糖 虽然很便宜 但我从小就爱死它了
This candy. It's cheap candy. I love it ever since I was a kid.

1097
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,830
有些人中意那些 看上去更高级的零食
Some folks favor more sophisticated snacks

1098
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:49,320
牛轧糖和那些破玩意儿
Nougat center and all that fu-fu shit.

1099
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,210
但我不喜欢
But not me, Bob.

1100
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:53,680
我就爱吃这个
This is it for me.

1101
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,780
我觉得紧张的时候
Now. Sometimes, if I'm feeling anxious

1102
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:00,300
我就大嚼一番
I just bite right into it

1103
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:04,120
但平时我还是会慢慢的
But mostly, I take my time.

1104
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:06,380
将它一点一点吃完
I make it last.

1105
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:15,530
他们的名字 编号和位置
Names, ranks and location of the strike team.

1106

1107
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,240
没名字
No names

1108
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,950
没编号
No ranks

1109
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:31,980
他们...
They...

1110
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:34,650
早就逃之夭夭了
They just clean.

1111
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,260
知道了布鲁斯特 我会准备晚餐的
Alright Brewster. I'm gonna fix you dinner

1112
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:50,880
然后我要出去一下 去帮个朋友做点事
and then I'm going to run out for a little while and help a friend.

1113
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:54,930
- 做什么事？- 就是帮朋友啦
- Help with what? - Helping a friend.

1114
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,680
泽尔达
Zelda.

1115
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,250
门
Door.

1116
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:06,630
你他妈的连门都不能帮着开一下吗
Well, You could well help me answer the door, Brewster!

1117
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:09,180
你就坐在离门十尺的地方！
You're sittin' right there just ten feet away from it.

1118
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,830
我背疼啊 婆娘 你去就是了
My back is acting up, woman. You move.

1119
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:12,760
背疼 背疼 你就知道背疼
Your back. Your back. Always your back.

1120
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,440
斯特里克兰先生！
Mr. Strickland!

1121
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:19,640
你怎么在这？
What are you doing here?

1122
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:22,500
- 那个男人是谁？ - 它在哪？
- Who's that man, Zelda? - Where is it?

1123
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,010
- 你在说啥？- 你把它带到哪儿去了？
- What are you talking about? - Where did you take it?

1124
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:25,150
泽尔达
Zelda.

1125
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:31,990
在实验室里
The thing in the lab.

1126
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:33,990
哪儿？
Where is it?

1127
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,900
- 什么在哪里？- 给我坐下！
- Where is what? - Sit down!

1128
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:46,630
哎呀先生我不是有意的
I'm sorry, Sir.

1129
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:49,010
要是我知道 我肯定会告诉你的
If I knew anything I would surely tell you.

1130
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,210
我还没告诉你参孙的故事
That story about Samson.

1131
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:58,440
是如何结束的
I never told you how it ended.

1132
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:03,320
在非利士人狠狠折磨 还把他弄瞎了之后
After the Philistines torture him and blind him.

1133
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,780
于是他向上帝祈求力量
Samson asks God for the strength he needs

1134
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:11,860
就在最后一刻
And at the last minute, he is spared.

1135
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:13,960
上天
And the Lord...

1136
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,670
给予了他所要的力量
Gives him his strength back.

1137
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,680
最后一次
One last time.

1138
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:27,630
他抓住了神庙的柱子
And he holds the columns of the temple

1139
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:32,940
然后用他有力的胳膊把柱子推了个粉碎
with his powerful arms and crushes them

1140
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:47,570
整个庙都塌了 把非利士人也给埋了
And he brings the whole building down on the Philistines.

1141
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:58,970
他是死了 但他也把那些狗屁玩意儿全部操翻了
He dies. But he gets every single one of those motherfuckers.

1142
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:01,230
那就是他的愿望
That is his will.

1143
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,330
现在
Now.

1144
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:09,780
你现在明白这个故事的意思了么？
Do you know what that particular story means?

1145
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,870
对于我们来说 黛利拉
For us, Delilah

1146
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:15,580
它告诉我们 如果你有什么瞒着我的话
It means that if you know something you're not telling me,

1147
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:18,720
你终究会告诉我的
you're gonna tell me. Either.

1148
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,240
无论是要等到我
Either before or after...

1149
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:24,530
把你家毁掉之前
I bring this particular temple...

1150
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:28,520
还是之后
down upon our heads.

1151
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:31,790
那个哑巴把它从实验室偷走了
Gal stole that thing right out the lab!

1152
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:33,610
不管它是什么
Whatever it is.

1153
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:35,400
你去找吧
You go took it.

1154
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,270
我听我老婆
I heard my wife.

1155
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:38,420
打电话的时候讲的
Talking on the phone about it.

1156
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:46,820
非常感谢你  富勒先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller for your assistance.

1157
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:00,560
- 你做了什么? - 泽尔达!
- What have you done? - Zelda!

1158
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:03,520
我得提醒他们! 他去找她了
I got to warn her. He's going after her

1159
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:05,680
女人 你不许这样做
You will do no such thing, Woman.

1160
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:08,720
你管她做什么? 她犯法了
Why you worry about her? She broke the laws

1161
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:11,440
闭嘴  布鲁斯特! 你闭嘴!
Shut up, Brewster! You shut up!

1162
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:13,390
这么多年你一言不发
For years, you don't talk

1163
01:50:14,610 --> 01:50:16,220
你可以继续闭嘴了
and now you can't shut your mouth.

1164
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,500
去你丫的 布鲁斯特!
Damn you Brewster!

1165
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,750
你不会明白的
You wouldn't understand.

1166
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:26,450
说什么都没用 你永远明白不了的
You couldn't understand. Not if you tried your whole life

1167
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,240
- 嗨? - 吉尔斯 是你吗?
- Hello? - Giles, that you?

1168
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,540
- 是的 - 让艾丽莎接电话
- Yes. - Put Elisa on the phone.

1169
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:33,670
是泽尔达的电话
It's Zelda.

1170
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:38,150
艾丽莎 亲爱的 如果你能听见我的话  弄点声音
Elisa, honey, make a sound in the phone if you can hear

1171
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,850
好
Okay, good.

1172
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,210
他去找你了
He's coming for you.

1173
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:44,700
你现在得走了 带上那个东西
You got to go now and you go to take that thing with you.

1174
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,850
怎么了? 艾丽莎!
What? Elisa!

1175
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,540
妈的
Dammit.

1176
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:42,230
我们得下车了!
We have to go!

1177
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:45,390
你在哪?
Where are you?

1178
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:47,990
你他妈的到底在哪?!
Where the fuck are you?!

1179
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:32,560
你好啊
That's nice.

1180
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:12,690
我从不会失手
I do not fail.

1181
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:16,540
我做到了
I deliver.

1182
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,130
艾丽莎!
Elisa!

1183
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:25,290
艾丽莎!
Elisa!

1184
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:34,750
不
No.

1185
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,220
我的天
Fuck.

1186
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:28,010
你确实是个神
You are a God.

1187
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,000
关于她的故事
If I told you about it

1188
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,360
我要怎么说呢
What would I say?

1189
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,520
说他们从此以后幸福的生活在一起?
That they lived happily ever after?

1190
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:43,290
我相信是这样的
I believe it is.

1191
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,400
他们相爱
That they were in love

1192
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,020
永远相爱
That they remained in love.

1193
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:49,440
我确定这是真的
I'm sure that's true.

1194
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:54,000
当我想起她时 想起艾丽莎...
But when I think of her, Elisa...

1195
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:58,220
只有一首诗 浮现在我的脑海
The only thing that comes to mind is a poem

1196
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:02,780
那是几百年前一对情侣的甜言蜜语...
Whispered by someone in love, hundreds of years ago...

1197
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,380
“无法描述你的形状”
“Unable to perceive the shape of You"

1198
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,940
“我感觉到你围绕着我”
"I find You all around me."

1199
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:13,730
“因为你的存在 我满眼都是你的爱意”
"Your presence fills my eyes with your love"

1200
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:16,570
“它让我的心变的柔软”
"It humbles my heart"

1201
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,450
“你无处不在”
"For you are everywhere"
