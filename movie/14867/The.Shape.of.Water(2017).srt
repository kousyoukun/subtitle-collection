1
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,580
水形物语

2
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,550
若要我提及此事
If I spoke about it.

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,790
若真的要我说
If I did.

4
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,800
我又该和你说些什么呢
What would I tell you?

5
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,820
让我想想
I wonder?

6
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,070
我该告诉你故事发生的时间吗
Would I tell you about the time?

7
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,910
我感觉 这是在很久以前了
It happened a long time ago- It seems...

8
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,330
当时 一位可敬的王子统治着一切
In the last days of a fair Prince's reign...

9
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,440
或者 我该告诉你故事发生的地方吗
Or would I tell you about the place?

10
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,120
那是海岸边的一座小城市
A small city near the coast

11
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,860
与世隔绝
but far from everything else...

12
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,510
要不
Or, I don't know.

13
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,560
我跟你讲讲她吧
Would I tell you about her?

14
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,110
那位失声的公主
The princess without voice

15
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,910
还是说 我来讲讲
Or perhaps I would just warn you

16
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,860
这个故事背后的真相
about the truth of these facts

17
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,440
一个爱与失的故事
and the tale of love and loss

18
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,460
还有那只野兽
and the monster

19
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,940
那只曾试图毁灭一切的野兽
that tried to destroy it all...

20
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,970
亲爱的荷达大人
My Lord Hedak.

21
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,690
你有什么烦心事吗
So, you are troubled.

22
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,300
跟我说说吧
Tell me.

23
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,680
我已是
I have...

24
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,990
我已是有罪之身
I have sinned.

25
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,700
我触犯了神明
I've offended the god.

26
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,250
我深陷在我的罪恶中 荷达大人
I'm deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.

27
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,090
你说出来 让我做出决断
Let me judge of that.

28
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,810
我曾质疑献祭的仪式
I've doubted the ceremony of the sacrifice.

29
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
每日沉思
时间是流经过往的河流

30
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,150
是警笛把你吵醒的吗
Did the sirens wake you up?

31
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,600
是一场大火 巧克力工厂
It was a fire. The chocolate factory.

32
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,510
你闻到了吗 哦 天啊
You smell that? Oh my...

33
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,380
烤可可
Toasted cocoa.

34
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,990
悲剧与喜悦 携手扑面而来
Tragedy and delight-- Hand in hand.

35
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,580
要吃点什么吗

36
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
哦 我亲爱的孩子
Oh dear child.

37
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,930
如果没有你的照顾的话 我应该早就昏死过去了
I'd waste away if you weren't here looking after me.

38
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,400
我就是那种时时刻刻需要受到照顾的人 看看这个
I am the proverbial starving. Watch this.

39
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,580
现代踢踏舞 楼梯间的舞蹈
Bojangles, the stair dance.

40
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,050
很难跳
That's so hard.

41
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,970
卡格尼会跳 跳得不一样但是也美
Cagney did it. Different but beautiful.

42
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,650
真美

43
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,960
我也想跳
I want to do that too.

44
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,510
好啊 你准备好了吗
All right. Are you ready?

45
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,850
-是的 -来吧
- Yep. - Come on.

46
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,810
成功的回归
之
“鲁斯的故事”
和
“狂欢节”

47
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,290
伊莱莎
Elisa.

48
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,200
下次你要交房租的时候
Next time you're going to bring the rent,

49
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,320
我希望你能留下来看看这部圣经电影 怎么样
I want you to stay and see the bible movie, huh.

50
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,280
我这 我这儿有两张免费的票

带上你的邻居查尔斯一起来看 他是个好孩子
You bring your neighbor Charles. He's a good boy.

52
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,970
想看喜剧电影吗 现在都没人来影院看电影了
Find a movie in comedy? Nobody's coming to the theater, huh.

53
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,080
谢谢

54
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,030
我可以给你送免费的爆米花和饮料噢
I can throw you a free popcorn and soda.

55
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,810
哦 不 天哪 应该是“节”
Oh no, for God's sake! There's two "S' there.

56
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,930
拜托 是“节” 狂欢节 不是狂欢街
Come on. Two "S". Mardi Grass. Mardi Grass.

57
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,700
伊莱莎 快点 快来 快来
Elisa, come on. Come here already!

58
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,790
-你得准时点啊 -嘿 你在干什么
- You gotta learn to be on time. - Hey, what you doing?

59
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,280
-你不能插队啊 -你就放过她吧
- Don't cut in, Dummy. - Leave her alone, woman.

60
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,420
我给她留了位置了
I was keepin' her place.

61
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,940
我要去报告 我要去举报你和那个哑巴
I get reported. I come after you and the mute.

62
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,640
去吧 尤兰达
You do that, Yolanda.

63
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,130
有种你就去吧
You do that.

64
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,500
我的脚疼死了
My feet are already killin' me.

65
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,420
今晚走之前 我给布鲁斯特做了小热狗吃
I made Brewster pigs in the blanket tonight before leavin'.

66
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,120
他吃得干干净净的
Boy, he just ate 'em up.

67
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,870
没有一句谢谢 没有一句好吃 连看都不看一眼
No thank-yous, no yum-yums, not a peep-

68
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,770
男人就像坟墓一样沉默
Man is silent as the grave.

69
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,900
如果放个响屁算是对你奉承的话
But if farts were flattery

70
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,500
亲爱的 那他可算是莎士比亚了
Honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

71
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,890
之后我回到家 为他做早饭
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

72
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,540
鸡蛋 培根 涂好黄油的吐司
Eggs, bacon and buttered toast.

73
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,410
我为这个男人的吐司涂黄油
I butter the man's toast,

74
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,400
伊莱莎 两边都涂了 像个孩子一样照顾他
Elisa. Both sides-As if he was a child...

75
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,980
但我连句谢谢都听不到
And I don't even get a thank you

76
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,860
你肯定心存感激 因为你受过教育
You'd be grateful, because you are an educated woman.

77
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,050
但是我的布鲁斯特 他仅有的优点
But my Brewster, all he had

78
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,420
就是他当年那无法抵挡的魅力
gone for him was animal magnetism back in the day

79
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,220
我就被迷得神魂颠倒
And workin' awhile.

80
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,180
这乱糟糟的算什么事
What in the same hell?

81
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,350
卢
Lou!

82
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,320
你们就不会乖乖地把垃圾扔到垃圾桶里吗
You boys mind puttin' the trash in the can?

83
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,550
那是垃圾桶的正确用处
That's what it's that for.

84
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,400
很难相信 是吧 那就是垃圾桶的正确用途
Hard to believe, uh? That's what it's that for.

85
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,790
好吧 好吧 抱歉 泽尔达
Alright. Alright. Sorry Zelda,

86
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,470
-抱歉 -我不知道他们在干什么
-sorry. - I don't know what they're doin'.

87
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,700
整天弄得乱糟糟的 真是
Makin' a goddamn mess, in what I'd say.

88
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,910
-泽尔达 别再发牢骚了 -是的 长官

- There's no call for the blaspheme. - Sorry, Mr. Fleming.

90
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,710
耽误你们一点时间
A moment of your time.

91
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,830
今天 我们T-4实验室将迎来一支新的团队 还有我们新的研究项目
Today, we are receiving a new team and asset here in T-4.

92
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,630
这位是罗伯特·霍夫施塔特博士
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler,

93
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,220
他从我们加尔维斯顿总部远道而来
from our system facility in Galveston.

94
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,420
我不想夸夸而谈他们有多厉害 但是
Now, I don't want to bolster or overstate the matter but uh

95
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,740
我相信他们所带来的研究项目 将会是我们
this may very well be the most sensitive asset

96
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,160
这里最宝贵的财富
ever to be housed in this facility

97
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,590
-一路还算顺利吧 -还好

98
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,090
-谁是这儿的安保 -请稍等一下
- Who's security here? - Just one moment please.

99
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,430
-安保 谁是这儿的安保 -长官 欢迎来到T4实验室
-Security. Who's security here? - Welcome to T-4, sir.

是的 长官 我叫弗莱明 是这里的安保组长
Yes, sir. I am Flemington, Head of Security...

101

让他们出去
Get them out.

102
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,430
帮我把这个气缸放到压缩器里
Help me move the cylinder into the compressor!

103
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,990
把它搬过来 搬过来
Bring it here. Bring it here.

104
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,870
伊莱莎 伊莱莎 咱们走
Elisa! Elisa, come on.

105
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,530
他们到底在搞些什么 你有看到吗
What goes on in this place? Did you see that?

106
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,920
是啦 我做了接发 又怎样呢
Yes, I'm wearing the hair piece. How's is it look like?

107
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,290
小心车
Careful of the car.

108
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,650
又不是那种女性假发 这是接发
It's not a hair piece. It's a toupee.

109
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,650
永久性的 知道吗
It's eternal, see?

110
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,250
坦塔罗斯从未逃过死亡之爪
Tantalus never achieved the escape of death.

111
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,360
枝头上的果实 恰好就在他够不到的地方
There's a fruit on the branches was just always out of his reach.

112
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,180
溪流中的水源
And the water in the stream

113
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,200
每当他弯下腰要去喝时 就枯竭了
receded every time he stooped down to drink.

114
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,250
这就是为什么我们如今会说
And so that's why we say things today like

115
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,430
看看那些坦塔罗斯(诱人)的派
Look at those tantalizing pies.

116

多谢噻 你哋会再来的吧

124
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,820
啊 我呀 我想我已经快上瘾了
Uh. I-uh. It's a craving I indulge in.

125
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,870
可能对我的健康无益 有什么东西上瘾后对身体有益呢
It can't possibly be good for me. Nothing that I like is...

126
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,830
不是噢 这个派很赞的 酸橙
No, no. It's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

127
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,640
你不会就是著名的迪克西·道格本人吧
You would happen to be the famous Dixie Doug himself, huh?

128
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,320
甘是不是啦 他的派到处都有卖嘎
Heck, no. Pies are trucked throughout the country.

129
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,670
-他们叫这个 加咩啊 特许经营 -噢
-They call it uh, franchising. See? - Oh.

130
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,770
佢哋给我哋嘀搅拌机 同埋标识
They give us the spinners, the signage.

131
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,430
那个是派小子 我哋的吉祥物
That there's pie boy. Our mascot.

132
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
其实我一般不这么讲话的
I don't talk like that.

133
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,670
-我是北方人 -不是吧
- I'm from Ottawa. - No.

134
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,580
我差点就信了
I completely bought it.

135
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,500
这派贼棒
That's-a-great-a-pie

136
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,640
那个 那个小个子男人 他是意大利人吗
The.. The Little guy. Is he supposed to be Italian?

137
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,510
我想是的
I guess so.

138
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,140
很聪明的营销策略
That was very clever.

139
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,780
你哋会再来的吧
Y'all come back now, y'heah?

140
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,150
你哋会再来的
Y'all come back now

141
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,550
你觉得他说的是真的吗
Do you think he meant it?

142
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,460
你也听到啦 他注意到我了
He had noticed me. You heard that.

143
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,740
这个派太腻了
This pie is rather sordid.

144
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,920
别吐出来啊 下次我们试试别的口味吧
Don't spit it out. Next time we go, well try different flavor.

145
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,540
以后再吃
Save it for later.

146
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,130
天哪 换掉那个频道 我不想看

147
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,090
我不想看这个
I do not want to see it.

噢 年轻又美丽
Oh. To be young and beautiful

151
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,760
如果我能回去
If I could go back,

152
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,870
回到十八岁的时候
to when I was eighteen

153
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,870
那时我什么都不知道
I didn't know anything about anything.

154
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,160
我会给自己一点建议
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

155
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,610
你会说什么

156
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,910
我会说 好好照顾你的牙齿 还有 尽情做爱
I would say. Take better care of your teeth and fuck-a lot more.

157
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,330
那真是很好的建议
That's very good advice.

158
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,200
#我可爱的小宝贝#

#我可爱的小宝贝#
# Pretty baby of mine. #

160
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,350
瞧瞧啊
Will you look at this?

161
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,490
听我说
Look.

166

他们怎么弄上去的
How do they get it up there?

167
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,500
你觉得他们要多大的尿盆才不会尿出来
Just how big a target do they need, you figure?

168
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,080
他们都这么大了 肯定也有不少经验了
They get enough practice that's for sure.

169
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,000
我的布鲁斯特
My Brewster,

170
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,640
没人说过他是什么聪明人
no one ever called him a great mind,

171
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,750
但是
but...

172
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,680
就算是他啊 他也有七成的几率能尿到池里
even he... Man he just hits the can seventy percent of the time.

173
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,880
-抱歉 先生 -不 不 没事的 继续吧
- Excuse us, sir. - No, no, no. That's alright. Go ahead.

174

你们女士们好像聊得很开心呀
You ladies seem to be chatting enjoyably.

175
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,110
肯定是女生间的悄悄话
Girl talk no doubt.

176
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,430
不用管我
Don't mind me.

177
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,170
伊莱莎
Elisa...

178
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,450
听着 别碰它
Look, don't touch.

179
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,500

Oh no, no. A man washes his

185
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,220
方便前洗手还是方便后洗手
hands before or after tending to his needs.

186
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,930
能透露出他很多的信息
That tells you a lot about that man.

187
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,050
如果他方便前后都洗手的话
If he does it both times,

188
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,310
说明他这个人肯定有致命的弱点
Points to a weakness in character.

189
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,650
女士们

很高兴能和你们二位聊天

个儿矮的人都很刻薄
Short people are mean.

192

我就没见过一个一直以善意待人的小个子
I've never met a short man that stays nice all the way through.

193

No, sir, mean little backstabbers, all of 'em.

194
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,700
也许是这里的空气的原因吧 氧气不够什么的
Maybe it's the air down there, not enough oxygen or somethin.

195
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,590

You think the Russians broke in? I don't think so.

And If they did, Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

对 三声 还有那声尖叫

不能让我们吃完晚饭再说吗
Any chance we might conclude our dinner?

205

-现在 -好吧

你们只有二十分钟时间
You will have exactly twenty minutes,

208
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,190
要把实验室搞得干干净净的

209
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,410

Twenty minutes.

210

一大摊血啊
It's a lot of blood.

211

what went on in here.

212

老娘能搞定尿 能搞定屎

The sooner we get out of here the better.

216

217
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,930
噢天哪
Oh!

218
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,940
一根手指
It's a finger!

219
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,980
两根手指
It's two fingers!

220
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,280

Okay, okay. Put 'em away and just wait here.

221
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,760
我去跟弗莱明说

那些残肢在哪儿呢
Where are these body parts?

223

残肢呢
The body parts?

No, I believe you, honey. Are you sure you it was alive?

225
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,380
我很确定

226
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,720
因为我以前在马戏团见过所谓的美人鱼
Because I saw a mermaid once in a carnival tent.

227
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,580

玉米片是为了防止手淫而发明的
Corn Flakes were invented to prevent masturbation.

234
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,760
但并没成功
It didn't work.

235
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,900
哦 爱丽丝·菲耶的节目要开始了
Oh, Alice Faye just started...

236
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,640
她以前是个巨星
She was a huge star, huge.

237
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,680
直到有一天她实在受不了娱乐圈的那些花言巧语
And one day she couldn't take the bullshit,

238
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,730
那些卑鄙小人
the backstabbing anymore

239
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,390
她就索性离开娱乐圈
and she just walked away from everything.

240
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,460
看看 当做次品来看的话 也还不错吧
Ta-da! It's not bad, is it? For being shit?

241
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,010
看起来很美啊

242
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,200
听着 你就乖乖吃饭 睡觉 休息
Huh, listen. You eat, you go to bed, you rest.

243

245
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,680

259
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,260

The Father looks like he just discovered the missionary position

260
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,880

Well uh... What would they supposed to be happy about?

262
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,920
我想要像照片一样逼真的作品 我答应他们的
I want the photographs. I sold them on this

263
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,330

- It's too bad-this is nice work. - It is nice, isn't it?

你是说 我被你开除后吧
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

269
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,470
我们现在最好不要谈这个

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,040
认真做好这个
Now do this!

273
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,450
鸡蛋

274
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,760
伊莱莎
Elisa!

275
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,690
你在那儿做什么呢
What are you doing in there?

276
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,940
是在打扫吧
Cleaning, huh?

277
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,130
听着 亲爱的
Listen, honey.

278
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,330
那个撒尿不用双手握着的怪胎先生想见咱俩
Mr.I Pee with my hands on my hips wants to see us both.

279
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,200
泽尔达·迪·富勒
Zelda D. Fuller.

280
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,690
你们俩认识多久了 泽尔达
How long have you two known each other, Zelda?

281
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,350
差不多十年了吧 长官
About ten years, Sir.

282
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,590
你没有兄弟姐妹吗 泽尔达
No siblings, Zelda?

283
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,170
没有 长官
No, sir...

284
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,220
这并不常见吧 对你们黑人来说
That's not common, is it? For your people?

285
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,590
我妈妈在我之后就去世了
My momma died after me.

286
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,130
我出生以后
After I was born.

287
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,520
名字里的迪是什么意思
What does the D stand for?

288
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,650
迪莱拉 长官
Delilah, Sir.

289
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
根据圣经取的
On account of the bible.

290
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,710
迪莱拉 她背叛了参孙
Delilah. She betrayed Samson.

291
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,900
引诱他入睡 剪掉他的头发
Lull him to sleep, cut his hair.

292
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,090
非利士人折磨他 羞辱他
Philistines torture him, humiliate him-

293
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,320
把他的双眼都给烧了
Burn his eyes out.

294
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,070
看来我妈妈读书读得不够仔细啊
I guess my momma didn't read the good book close enough

295
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,000
你呢
And you?

296
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,530
伊莱莎·埃斯波西托
Elisa Esposito.

297
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,420
埃斯波西托是孤儿的意思吗
Doesn't Esposito means Orphanage?

298
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,060
我们这位来自普特南的索罗孤儿院的女士
Our Lady of Sorrows Orphanage in Putnam.

299
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,160
他们是在河边发现她的
They found her by the river in the water.

300
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,900
是你 发现了我的手指吗
It was you... that found my fingers?

301
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,510
噢 谢谢你
Oh! Thanks.

302
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,930
我在急诊室里呆了三个小时
Three hours in surgery.

303
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,570
他们重建了趾骨 这里 缝合了筋腱
They rebuilt the first phalanx, here, sutured the tendons.

304
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,950
也不知道这会不会成功
Don't know if it's going to take it or not.

305
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,020
上面还有芥末
There was mustard on them.

306
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,930
-一个纸袋 -我们当时只有那个 长官
-A paper bag. - It was all we had, Sir.

307
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,870
我回答大多数问题 是因为 她说不了话
I answer mostly, on account that she can't talk.

308
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,250
说不了话 她聋了吗
She can't? Is she deaf?

309
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,490
哑了 长官
Mute, sir.

310
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,330
她说她能听见你
She said she can hear you.

311
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,420
你脖子上的伤疤
All those scars on your neck.

312
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,560
是你的声带被割坏时留下的吗
That's what that it cut your voice box, right?

313
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,390
她说从她婴儿时期就有了
She said since she was a baby.

314
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,120
谁会对一个婴儿这么狠啊
Who would do that to a baby?

315
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,460
世界是充满罪恶的 你说呢 迪莱拉
The world is sinful. Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

316
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,690
好了 我就直说吧
Well, let me say this upfront.

317
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,750
你们打扫实验室 完工就出来
You clean that lab. You get out.

318
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,870
那里面的东西是你们惹不起的
The thing we keep in there, is an affront.

319
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,930
你知道惹不起是什么意思吧 泽尔达
Do you know what an affront is, Zelda?

320
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,010
它具有攻击性
Something offensive?

321
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,700
没错 我早该知道的 我把那个
That's right. And I should know, I've dragged that...

322
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,910
脏东西
...filthy thing

323
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,490
大老远从南美的泥沙弄回来
out of the river muck in South America all the way here

324
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,540
这一路我们俩过得都挺遭罪的
And along the way we didn't get to like each other much.

325
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,770
好吧
Now.

326
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,560
你们可能觉得 那东西看起来像人
You may think... that thing looks human

327
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,610
能双脚直立行走 是吧
Stands on two legs, right?

328
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,590
但是 我们是按造物主的样子创造出来的
But... we're created in the Lord's image.

329
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,550
你们该不会觉得造物主就长那模样吧
You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?

330
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,490
长官 我可不知道造物主长什么样
I wouldn't know, Sir. What the Lord looks like.

331
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,440
呃 人样 泽尔达 造物主长人样 像我这样
Well, human, Zelda. He looks like a human, like me.

332
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,800
或甚至像你那样
Or even you.

333
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,010
我猜可能更像我一点吧
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

334
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,350
好了 你们出去吧
Well, that's all.

335
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,900
霍伊特将军 感谢您的回电 长官
General Hoyt. Thank you for calling me back, Sir.

336
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,930
-你好一点了吗 -噢是的长官 好多了
- You feel better? - Oh yes, Sir. Much better.

337
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,290
止痛药的功劳
Pain pills, is all.

338
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,120
-断了两根手指是吗
- You lost two fingers. Was it?

339
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,930
没错 他把我两根手指咬下来了
- Two fingers yeah. He got two fingers.

340
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,710
大拇指 食指 中指都还在呢
But I still got my thumb, my trigger and my pussy finger

341
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,560
-听起来你状态挺好的 -是的 长官 没什么大问题
- Sounds to me like you'll be all right. - Yes, sir, that's right.

342
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,440
期待您的光临 长官
Looking forward to your visit, Sir.

343
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,090
关于这个东西的处置还有待商讨
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

344
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,980
鸡蛋

345
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,400
能到达朴次茅斯市中心的任何位置
...free to locations on Downtown Portermouth.

346
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,160
未来就在这里
The Future is here.

347
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,870
去休息吧
Get to rest.

348
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,080
九点半来接我
Pick me up on 9:30.

349
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,340
二十一点三十分 没问题 长官
Twenty one hundred and thirty hours. Yes, Sir.

350
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,850
你值得拥有
...that's great to buy.

351
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,570
我回来了
I'm home.

352
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,920
我给你做了煎蛋卷哦
I made you an omelet!

353
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,130
-嘿 老爸 你猜怎么着 -没有薄饼吗
- Hey Dad! Guess what? - No pancakes?

354
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,980
我已经拆了一大半这些箱子 就是找不到烤盘
I've gone half through the boxes. I can't find the griddle...

355
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,680
-我给你做了奶酪和西兰花薄饼 -你猜怎么着
I made you cheese and broccoli omelette, - Guess what?

356
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,020
感觉怎么样 还疼吗
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

357
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,250
-还有点 止痛药挺管用的 -你猜怎么着
- A little bit. Pills help. - Guess what?

358
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,660
-怎么了 -我们在新学校埋了一个时空胶囊
- What? - We're burying a time capsule, at the new school.

359
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,100
我本来想问你
I wanted to ask you.

360
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,490
我们在未来有没有可能都能拥有喷气飞行器
Do you think we'll all have jet packs, in the future?

361
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,240
-会有的 儿子 -校车来了
-Believe it son. - Bus is here.

这里可是美国
This is America.

363
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,800
爸爸再见
Bye dad!

364
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,660
把煎蛋卷吃完
Finish your omelet and wash

365
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,860
洗净净你的手手 然后上楼来 亲爱的
your hands real good and come upstairs, Sweetie.

366
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,660
我挺喜欢这里的
I kinda like it here.

367
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,470
孩子们很喜欢这里的草坪
The kids like the lawn. Plus,

368
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,550
而且华盛顿离这也就半小时的路程 你觉得呢
DC is just half an hour away, isn't it?

369
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,660
巴尔的摩就是巴尔的摩 伊莱恩 没人喜欢巴尔的摩
It's still Baltimore, Elaine. No one likes Baltimore.

370
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,120
你知道吗
You know what I'm thinking?

371
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,810
我想 我需要一辆新车了
I'm thinking. I need a new car.

你需要辆新车 是吗
Do you need a new car, do you?

373
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,160
来辆凯迪拉克怎么样呢 先生
How about a Cadillac, Mr.?

374
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,310
理查德

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,910
音乐

384
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,910
音乐

385
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,150
你还好吗

386
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,500
窗台上的麻雀窝
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

387
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,140
什么
- What?

388
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,560
窗台上的麻雀窝
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

389
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,960
老鹰把猎物抓走了
And the eagle takes the prey.

390
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,660
什么
- What?

391
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,210
暗号

392
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,710
老鹰把猎物抓走了

393
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,750
出发

394
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,360
鲍勃
Bob!

395
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,050
最近怎么样

396
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,110
我像个傻子一样 在前不着村 后不着店的地方

397
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,980
傻傻地坐在混凝土块上等了一个钟

398
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,950
我们每次都在这种破餐馆碰面

399
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,310
我们可以换个地方嘛

400
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,480
但是你没有呀

401
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,510
跟我们说说

402
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,480
鲍勃

403
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,210
迪米特里

404
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,250
好同志

405
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,210
不是鲍勃

406
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,080
那是什么

407
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,480
迪米特里

408
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,350
解剖笔记

409
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,710

410
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
实验室的分布图

411
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,110
他们就是在那研究这个东西的

412
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,780
我们所需的所有

413
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
重点都在这里了

414
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,680
我会把这些都上交到指挥部的

415
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,950
我们得加快速度了

416
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,780
米哈尔科夫

417
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,950
这个生物

418
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,810
我认为他能够

419
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,010
交流

420
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,780
交流吗

421
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,110
是的 和人类交流

422
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,780
我有理由相信

423
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,380
他很聪明

424
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,680
他能对

425
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,350
他能对

426
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,880
语言

427
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,950
音乐做出反应

428
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,380
能恳请您

429
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,450
把这个信息也传达上去吗

430
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,480
我会的

431
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,110
现在

432
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,950
吃吧 德米特里

433
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,610
他们把这叫作

434
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,450
海

435
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,680
陆

436
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,150
海陆大餐

437
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:12,250
龙虾是现煮的

438
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,810
咬下去滋滋脆

439
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,250
但是他们

440
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,710
特别软

441
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,410
还很鲜美

442
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,270
伊莱莎 快快 快点
Elisa! Hurry! Hurry! Come on.

443
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,430
快打卡 天呐 妹子
Swipe it. God, girl.

444
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,520
-你再敢来一次试试 泽尔达 -噢 少来了你 尤兰达
- You're doing it again, Zelda. - Oh. Give it a rest, Yolanda!

445
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,530
嘿 泽尔达 来一口吗
- Hey, Zelda, you want to smoke?

446
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,230
那玩意对你可不好 杜恩
- That shit's ain't good for you, Duane.

447
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,470
是啊 但是很爽
Yeah. But it feel good.

448
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,800
是啊 可不是嘛
- It does, doesn't it?

449
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,600
来吧 伊莱莎 就一口
C'mon Elisa, just one.

450
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,360
来吧 来吧 来吧
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon

451
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,850
不用担心监控摄像头
Don't worry about that camera.

452
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,530
休息时间 监控录像都是关掉的
We push them off on break time.

453
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,580
嗯哼
Uh-mm

454
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,230
这里是盲区
This here's a blind spot.

455
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,490
我要在这里做点准备工作
I may have to finish some things in here,

456
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,790
你们去接将军
fetch the General, will ya?

457
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,160
噢 想我了吗
Oh. You miss me, huh?

458
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,170
我带了方糖
I took a candy break.

459
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,610
是这个玩意儿吓到你了吧 哈
This is what scares you, huh?

460
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,520
天哪 你也该习惯了吧
Jeez, be used to it by now.

461
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,510
又来了 发出这么难听的声音
There you go again. Making that god-awful sound.

462
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,180
是你的哭声吗 哈 你就这样哭的吗
Is that you crying, huh? Is that what it is?

463
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,260
很难过吧 哈
Are you hurting? Huh?

464
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,230
还是你在生气呢
Or maybe you're angry?

465
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,930
是不是想再咬我一口
Maybe you'd like to get another bite at me.

466
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,110
哈 来呀
Huh? Go ahead.

467
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,250
我搞不懂了
I can't tell.

468
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,320
你这是在求我吗
Are you begging?

469
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,020
在我听来这是他妈最难听的声音了
'Cause to me it's just the worst fucking noise I've ever heard.

470
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,720
伊莱莎
Elisa?

471
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,700
伊莱莎
Elisa!

472
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,160
霍伊特将军 欢迎 长官
General Hoyt! Welcome, Sir!

473
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,260
一切准备就绪了 很高兴您能来 长官
Everything's ready. Glad to have you here, Sir!

474
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,120
-很高兴见到你 孩子 -谢谢您
- Good to see you, son. - Thank you.

475
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,430
老天爷哟 就是这东西吗
Good God Almighty, Is that it?

476
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,550
比我想的大多了
A lot bigger than I thought.

477
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,780
丑得不行
Ugly as sin.

478
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,540
你知道吗 亚马逊原住民把他当神来供奉
You know, the natives in the Amazon worshipped it as a God.

479
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,060
现在这个鬼样子 可不像什么神灵啊
It doesn't look like much of a God now, does it?

480
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,440
长官 你也知道啦 他们都是群野蛮人 整天往水里扔点花花果果
Well, they were primitive, Sir. You know they tossed offerings

481
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,910
就当作贡品了
into the water, flowers, fruits, crap like that.

482
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,230
还试着用自己的弓箭来阻止我们钻取石油
Then they tried to stop the oil drill with bows and arrows.

483
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
简直是螳臂挡车嘛
That didn't turn out too well.

484
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,090
他在流血 你做了什么
He's bleeding. What happened?

485
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:05,640
你做了什么
What happened?

486
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,840
它是个动物 霍夫施塔特 我只是想驯服它
- It's an animal, Hoffstetler. Just keeping it tame.

487
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,450
氧气渗透 二氧化碳转化
Oxygen osmosis and dioxide exchange.

488
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,420
-这些数据什么意思 -这个生物 长官
What the hell we got here, Son? - This creature, Sir

489
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,770
他能随意切换
It can alternate between

490
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,890
两套完全分离的呼吸系统
two entirely separate breathing mechanisms.

491
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,110
-弹涂鱼也能啊 -不
- Mudskipper can do that. - No.

492
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,370
是这样的 你想送人去太空上的话
Look. You want to put a man in space.

493
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,750
他们必须得承受
He's gonna have to endure

494
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,860
正常人类所不能承受的自然条件
conditions the human body just wasn't made for.

495
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,310
这是我们对付苏联的利器啊
This gives us an edge against the Soviets.

496
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,260
他能在空气中呼吸多久
How long can it breathe outside the water?

497
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,370
长官 现在情况就是 我们对这个鬼东西一无所知
Reality, is, Sir. We don't know jackshit about this thing.

498
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,290
我们只知道苏联也想把这东西拿到手
Well, the Soviets want it. We know that much.

499
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,960
那些斗鸡眼的杂种
Those cockeyed bastards.

500
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,950
他们让苏联人把狗送上太空
You know, they let them send

501
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,020
我们一笑而过
a dog up in the space and we get a good laugh.

502
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,470
你还没反应过来 他们已经把人送上太空了
Then next thing you know, they send a human up.

503
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,920
一个俄国佬 绕着我们地球转 鬼知道他们想干些什么
A Ruskie, orbiting our planet, doing God knows what?

504
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,470
现在谁笑得出来 赫鲁晓夫
Who's laughing now? Krushchev.

505
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,580
就是这样 我们让他送条狗上太空
That's it. We let him put a dog in space,

506
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,780
他笑 送一个共产党上太空
he laughs, puts a commie in space

507
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,420
他笑 还把导弹送到古巴
he laughs, puts missiles in Cuba.

508
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,340
我们就不能长点记性吗
Have we learned nothing?

509
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,340
长官 我们得把他放回水里了
Sir. We need to get him back in the water

510
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,520
你看这些科学家 像艺术家一样
See this Scientist, they are like artists.

511
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,350
和自己的小玩具陷入爱河了
They fall in love with their playthings.

512
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,910
来 看到这里了吗 中间这一条
Now, right here-you see? Along the middle?

513
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,220
这玩意有粗粗的关节软骨
This creature has a thick jointed

514
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,980
把他的第一个和第二个肺分开了
cartilage separating the primary and secondary lungs.

515
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,740
我解释得对吗 鲍勃
Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?

516
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,980
-对的 但是我们得把他 -它也许还能发出X射线
- Yes, but we have to... - It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

517
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,530
理论上是的 长官 但是
- In principle, Sir, yes but...

518
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,650
如果我们想用他来对付苏联
- If we want to get the edge on the Soviets

519
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,270
-我们就得活体解剖这个玩意 -不不不
- we need to vivisect this thing. - No, no, no.

520
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,940
-把它大卸八块 看看它体内到底是怎样的 -不
Take it apart. Learn how it works. - No.

521
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,050
不可以 那样就和初衷背道而驰了
- No. That would defeat the purpose

522
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,950
长官 他要晕过去了 求你们了
Sir? He's passed out. Please.

523
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,390
把他放到水箱里 让他恢复气压
Put him in the tank. Let him pressurize.

524
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,580
霍伊特将军 长官
General Hoyt, sir!

525
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,780
你无论如何 都不能杀死这个生物
You cannot, under any circumstance, kill this creature.

526
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,950
看看我肩上是什么 五颗星
Count these with me, Son. There's five of them.

527
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,710
我他妈想怎么处置它就怎么处置它
That means I can do whatever the hell I want.

528
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,860
你有什么建议想说的 我会听听
You wanna plead your case? I'll listen to it.

529
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,720
但是到头来 我还是最终裁决者
But, end of the day, it is my damn decision.

530
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,050
把那鬼东西给解剖了
Then cut and open that thing.

531
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,100
我们得把一切弄得清清楚楚的
We need clarity in this case.

532
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,540
好好犒劳一下自己 斯特里兰
And give yourself a good pat on the back, Strickland.

533
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,490
-你做到了 -感谢你 长官
- You've done it. - Thank you sir.

534
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,140
加快步伐把这件事做完 孩子
Now hurry up and finish this job, son.

535
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,620
没问题 长官
Absolutely, sir.

536
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,680
把他弄出来 你在说什么
Get him out? What are you talking?

537
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,390
不 当然不行
No! Absolutely not!

538
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,310
为什么

539
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,380
因为这违法了 所以不行
Because it's breaking the law! And that's what.

540
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,760
可能我们这样过过嘴瘾都算是违法了呢
We're probably breaking the law, just talking about it.

541
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,450
他只身一人

542
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,550
没有人能帮他

543
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,410
噢 他只身一人 噢
Oh, he's alone. Oh.

544
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,290
这么说来 我们每次去中式餐厅
This mean that... whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant

545
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,000
你都想把水箱里的鱼救出来吗
you want to save every fish in the tank?

546
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,300
他只身一人又怎么样 我们都只能靠自己
So what if he's alone? We're all alone.

547
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,480
是你见过最孤独的东西
The loneliest thing you've ever seened?

548
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:31,970
好吧 你自己都说了 你自己都说出口了
Well you just said it, right? You just said it.

549
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,780
你叫他"东西" 他只是个东西 是个怪胎
You called it a thing. It's a thing. It's a freak.

550
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,480
你把我的手语读出来

551
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,590
我能理解你
I can understand you.

552
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,780
你根本没在听我说

553
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,510
重复

554
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:41,950
重复

555
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,310
重复

556
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,270
冷静 天啊 冷静点好吗
- Calm down! God, calm down!

557
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,010
把我的手语读出来

558
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,760
好吧 我 我跟着你说
Alright. I will... I will repeat it to you.

559
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,630
我是谁
"What I am?

560
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,680
我像他一样动嘴巴
I move my mouth, like him.

561
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,930
我像他一样说不出话
I make no sound, like him.

562
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,220
那我算是什么东西呢
What does that make me?

563
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,820
我这样的人 我的身世经历
All that I am, all that I've ever been

564
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,280
让我和他相遇
Brought me here to him.

565
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,460
你看 你现在又说"他"了 现在又变成"他"了
You see, you're saying "Him". It's a "Him" Now.

566
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,140
他是
It's a...

567
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,260
噢
Ow.

568
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,010
你打我
You just hit me!

569
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,730
伊莱莎 放开我
Elisa, let go of me.

570
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,960
我在看 我在看 你从没 打过我的
I'm looking, I'm looking. You've never... hit me!

571
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,860
他看着我的时候 他看我的方式
When he looks at me, the way he looks at me.

572
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,730
他不知道我有缺陷
He does not know what I lack.

573
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,720
不知道我是不完整的
Or how I am incomplete.

574
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,860
他眼中的我 是完整的
He sees me for what I am, as I am.

575
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,810
他看到我会很高兴
He's happy to see me

576
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,590
每一次 每一天
Every time, every day.

577
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:16,710
现在 我可以选择救他
And now I can either save him...

578
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,640
或者让他死去
...or let him die.

579
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,530
我得走了 我得 我得走了
I'm leaving. I have to... no I have to leave.

580
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,870
伊莱莎 拜托 别这样了 听我说 你听我说
Just Elisa, please stop! Listen to me. Just listen to me.

581
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,380
我得走了 我现在必须走了因为
I have to go! I'm leaving now because this...

582
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,170
伊莱莎 因为这对我很重要
Elisa, this is very important to me.

583
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,500
这是我的第二次机会了
This is a second chance for me!

584
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,240
我很抱歉 我真的得走了
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

585
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,640
等我回来的时候 我们再也不要讨论这件事了
And when I come back. We will not talk about this, ever again.

586
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,440
伊莱莎 够了 够了
Elisa... there's... Alright. Alright.

587
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,970
我们算老几啊 我和你 我们算什么 我们什么都不是
What are we? What are you and I? What we are? We are nothing!

588
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,450
没用的 我们什么都做不了
Nothing. We can't do nothing!

589
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,240
抱歉
I'm sorry.

590
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,450
但这 这 这真的
But this-this-this is just...

591
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,020
噢 天啊 他连人都算不上
Oh god! He's not even human!

592
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,410
天老爷
God.

593
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:09,980
又怎么
What?

594
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,510
如果我们

595
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,850
什么都不做

596
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,410
我们也算不上是人

597
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,270
贾尔斯
Giles!

598
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,400
-我一直在等你 -我知道 抱歉
- I've been waiting. - I know, sorry.

599
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,970
没事
It's okay.

600
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:38,940
我们不进去吗
We going in?

601
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,440
你直接把作品寄给我就行
You should've just mailed the art.

602
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,640
不 我想亲自给你和你们团队看
No! I wanted to show you it to you and the team and person

603
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,010
这是我最好的作品之一
It's some of my best work.

604
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,200
这绿色好像还行
As green as it can be!

605
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,150
现在呃
It's uh...

606
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,410
现在不是好时机 要不再等等吧
It's not a good time. Maybe later.

607
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,120
噢 好啊 没问题
Oh well, sure, no problem.

608
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,310
什么时候对你来说才是好时机 伯尼
What would be good time for you, Bernie?

609
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,300
你画的吗
You painted that?

610
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,670
是啊
- Yeah.

611
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,210
哇 你太厉害了
Wow!! You're good!

612
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,060
然而并没有照片那么好
Apparently, not as good as a photograph.

613
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,190
但还是很棒 不是吗 哈
But it's good, isn't it, huh?

614
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,300
哎 我反正画不出
Pfft. I couldn't paint like that.

615
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,380
给 我请
Here. On me.

616
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:29,780
请我吗
For me?

617
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,490
我们这像你这样的客人很少 你看起来
We don't get many like you in here. You seem...

618
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,030
很有学识 我喜欢和你交谈
very educated. I like talking to you.

619
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,670
是这样 这也是
The thing is... That's the...

620
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,270
我来这里的唯一原因
The only reason that I come in here is...

621
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:45,430
来聊天 而且我们的馅饼也确实不错 对吧
- The conversation. And the pie is mighty fine too, isn't it?

622
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,380
没错 没错
- Yeah. Yeah.

623
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,070
没加酸橙 不过也很棒了
It's no key lime. But it's good.

624
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,040
你知道吗 我是独立工作者 而且
You know, I work alone. And uh...

625
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:00,140
我的好朋友并不善言谈
my best friend is not much of a conversationalist.

626
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,510
所以呀 这就是我工作的一部分
You see? That's part of being on the job here.

627
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,060
和酒保是一样的
It's like being a bartender.

628
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,300
要给顾客上馅饼
You serve people pie,

629
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,140
还要倾听他们的故事 了解他们
you listen to their problems. Get to know them.

630
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,690
我想更好地了解你
I'd like to get to know you better.

631
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,240
你他妈在干嘛 臭老头
- What the hell are you doing, old man?

632
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,240
哇喔 噢噢
Whoa. Oh-oh.

633
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,000
嘿 不不不 不能坐柜台
Hey! No-no-no. Not the counter.

634
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,600
只能打包 你们不能坐这
Take out only. You can't sit there.

635
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,650
想要什么 点了 打包带走
You want something, you order, you take it out.

636
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,450
但这里没人呀 吧台已经
But it's empty... The counter is-

637
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,760
全部预定了 预定一整天 别坐那
All reserved. All day. You don't sit down.

638
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,940
你哋会再来的吧
Y'all come back now, Y'hear?

639
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,790
你不用这样跟他们讲话的
You don't need to talk to them like that.

640
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,220
你也该走了
You should go, too.

641
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,670
别再来我家店了 这是家族企业
And don't come back. This is a family restaurant.

642
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,690
我也只身一人
I have no one.

643
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,390
你是唯一一个愿意倾听我的人了
And you're the only person that I can talk to.

644
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,730
所以呢
Now.

645
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,900
不管这个鬼东西是什么
Whatever this thing is

646
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:10,880
你需要它
You need it.

647
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,120
那
So...

648
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,000
你只要告诉我 我该做什么
You just tell me what to do.

649
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,970
-"所有的一切" -"如同春天逝去般"
- "All those things..." - "As the spring recedes..."

650
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,310
走吧
Let's go!

651
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,910
莫斯科不会支持你的计划的

652
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,380
为什么

653
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,210
太冒险了

654
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,180
太仓促了

655
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,380
什么

656
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,650
我们只有两个选择 迪米特里

657
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:57,710
第一

658
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,650
你把他们进程拖慢

659
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,050
至少一周

660
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,550
他们明天就会行动

661
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,410
那

662
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,280
就只给我

663
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,380
第二条出路了

664
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,580
以色列的截断器

665
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,850
把它放在保险丝旁

666
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:22,550
它能帮你争取五到十分钟的一片漆黑

667
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,750
不会有监控 不会有门禁

668
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,750
 接着

669
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,580
你给它注射这个

670
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,280
注射

671
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,650
杀了他

672
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,980
毁了他

673
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,780
你还好吗

674
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,250
我来到这个国家

675
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,380
来尽可能地学习

676
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,580
作为一个爱国者 但是

677
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,910
也作为一个科学家

678
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,280
它仍然具有很高的研究价值

679
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,110
我们不需要研究它

680
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,150
我们需要的是

681
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,780
 不让美国人研究它

682
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,970

691
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,240
噢 这不是绿色 朋友 是水蓝色
- Oh, it's not green, my friend, Teal.

692
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,640
水蓝色看起来跟绿色没什么区别
- Well, Teal looks green to me.

693
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,470
但它不绿色的 这是限量版噢

你说你不能说话 是全哑
When you say you're mute, are you entirely silent

745

01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:38,050
假身份 套牌车 等等 诸如此类的
Forged ID. Fake plates. And so on and so forth...

834
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,690
而且他们挪动了坡道的主监控 长官
And they moved the main video camera on the dock, Sir.

835
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,520
先不要让其他人直到这件事 上报之前我们还有24小时调查时间
Well, no one has to know. We got 24 hours before I bounce out.

836
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,520
我电话通知上面了
I called it in.

837
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:47,610
你通知了
Did you called it in?

838
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,860
事情一发生我就
The moment it happened, I...

839
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,760
斯特里兰先生 长官
Mr. Strickland, Sir.

840
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,050
又有什么事 萨利
What is it, Sally?

841
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,610
霍伊特将军在线上 长官
- Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.

842
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,610
那可是我们的太空狗啊 斯特里兰
That thing was our Space Dog, Strickland.

843
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,620
你也心知肚明吧
You know that.

844
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,960
长官 我一定把他追回来
Sir, I'm gettin' it back.

845
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:06,600
我不 我不会坐以待毙的 长官
I don't-I can't be in a negative frame of mind, Sir.

846
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,940
所以你有信心吗
So you're feeling good?

847
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,120
信心十足 务必追回
Feeling strong. Getting it back.

848
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,940
我相信你可以
You can get it done.

849
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:15,420
你也一定要可以 为了我也要做到 孩子 为了我
You're gonna get it done. For me, Son. For me.

850
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,310
禁止在此垂钓

851
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:28,050
直通大海

852
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:29,550
禁止游泳

853
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,910
警告
30英尺处运河直通大海
10月-11月

854
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:59,480
10月
星期三
10号
下雨/码头

855
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,960
你要等到那天才把他给放了吗
Is that when you're planning on releasing him?

856
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,670
十号
On the tenth?

857
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,210
万一雨季来迟了呢
So what if the rains are late?

858
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,860
河道那里会怎样呢
What happens with the canal?

859
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:07,250
会下雨的

860
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,650
好吧
All right.

861
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,180
那是什么
What's that?

862
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,360
给我看看
Let me see it.

863
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:17,990
是给我的吗
Is that for me?

864
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,280
很高兴
和你
成为朋友

865
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,010
装吧 你就继续装吧
That's good, keep it up.

866
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,090
装得跟个没事人似的
Lookin' like you don't know anything.

867
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,040
如果他们问我干了什么
Lord help me if they ask me if I do.

868
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,280
我可不怎么会撒谎
I am not a good liar.

869
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:10,710
除了对布鲁斯特
Except for Brewster.

870
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,160
谎言是维系婚姻的秘诀
Takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going.

871
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,420
全体员工
All personnel.

872
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,940
准备好出示您的身份证和门禁卡
Prepare to present your ID and entrance card.

873
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,570
安保措施已经
Security measures has been...

874
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,210
这是怎
What in the...?

875
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,730
全体员工 请注意
Attention. All personnel.

876
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,200
准备好出示您的身份证和门禁卡
Prepare to present your ID and entrance card

877
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:28,190
都是你惹的祸
You got us in trouble!

878
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,230
长官 我觉得我们的对手是一支训练有素的队伍
In my opinion, we are looking at a highly trained group, Sir.

879
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,900
我觉得很有可能
I'm thinking, conceivably,

880
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,470
是某支特种部队什么的
Sir. Special Forces and so on and so forth.

881
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,020
红军特种部队吗
Red Army Special forces?

882
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,000
非常有可能
- Conceivably.

883
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:42,340
一支训练有素 靠山强硬的精英部队
A highly-trained, well-financed, elite group.

884
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,610
身手敏捷 冷酷决绝 作战精准
Highly efficient, ruthless, clockwork precision.

885
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,850
他们潜入这里总共才花了5分钟
Infiltration took less than five minutes, Sir.

886
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,990
保守估计
My conservative estimate is that

887
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,140
也得有个十来人左右才能干得来
this is a Strict Force of at least 10 men.

888
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:08,320
你一直都是一个人吗
Have you always been alone?

889
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,810
你有跟人处过吗
Did you ever have someone?

890
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,600
你知道你的身世吗 你还记得吗
Do you know what happened to you? Do you?

891
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,820
因为 我就不知道 我都不知道我这是怎么了
'Cause I don't. I don't know what happen to me.

892
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,120
我不知道
I don't know.

893
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:24,750
我看着镜子
I look in the mirror,

894
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,210
我唯一认得的就是这双眼睛
the only thing that I recognize are these eyes.

895
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,100
在我这张老脸上
In this old man's face.

896
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:37,200
有时候我觉得
And sometimes I think I was

897
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,350
我要么生得太早了 要么有点太晚了
either born too early or too late for my life.

898
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:44,600
可能我们都快行将就木了
Maybe we're both just relics.

899
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,710
长官 她们来了
Sir? I got them.

900
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,820
泽尔达 伊莱莎 请进
Zelda, Elisa. Come in.

901
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,670
看起来好像事情发生之前 你们俩都打卡下班了
Looks like you two, punched out before the incident.

902
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:15,630
所以
So.

903
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,500
如果你们知道点什么
If you know something about what transpired here.

904
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,090
你们有义务如实上报
It's your obligation to report any detail.

905
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,690
不论线索看起来有多么微不足道
No matter how small or trivial it may seem.

906
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,450
微不足道 就是说不太重要
"Trivial" Means "Unimportant".

907
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,040
我不知道有什么反常的 没有
I didn't seem nothin' out of the ordinary. No.

908
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,490
也没有什么微不足道的事 我的脚当时很痛
Or trivial. See? My feet were hurting...

909
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:36,640
你呢
What about you?

910
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:41,210
她什么都没看见
She didn't see anything.

911
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:52,940
霍夫施塔特 霍夫施塔特博士呢
Hoffstetler. Dr. Hoffstetler.

912
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,770
你们俩有没有看见他进出过实验室
Did either of you see him coming in or out of the lab?

913
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,850
他在里面工作啊 不是吗
He works there, doesn't he?

914
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,850
我说的是另一种进出
I mean in a different way.

915
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:01,760
可能他做了些不一样的事
Doing something different.

916
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,280
微不足道的事嘛 没有 长官
Something trivial? No sir.

917
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:22,970
我在干什么
What am I doing?

918
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,320
讯问这两个傻逼帮手
Interviewing the fucking help...

919
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,650
清洁工
The shit cleaners...

920
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,340
扫厕所的
The piss wipers.

921
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,900
你们两个 走吧 走
You two, go ahead. Leave.

922
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,360
你跟我说什么
What did you say to me?

923
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:51,980
 我

924
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:52,980
 我

925
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,610
 操

926
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,050
 操

927
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:57,340
-她说什么 -我没看见
- What did she say? - I didn't catch it.

928
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:55,980
 你

929
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,610
 妈

930
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:57,350
 啊

931
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:03,620
-她说什么 -她说谢谢你
- What is she saying?! - She is saying "Thank you".

932
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,800
下一个
Next.

933
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:57,170
现在只剩一件事没做了
There's only one thing left to do.

934
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,790
自告奋勇
"Volunteer".

935
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,330
不要 不要
No! No!

936
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,020
我想早点回家
I want to get home early.

937
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:59,110
布鲁斯特最近心情不好
Brewster has been in a bad mood lately...

938
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,390
我的天呐
Holy Jesus!

939
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:04,380
你猥猥琐琐地
What are you doing standing

940
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,800
站在女更衣室的暗处干什么呢
in the shadows of the women's locker room??

941
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,900
他们可能在监视我 这里没摄像头
They may be watching me, and there are no cameras here/

942
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,990
就是为了不让人看到啊
For good reason.

943
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,890
现在风声正紧 你找我们做什么
What if you caught us in an inconvenient moment?

944
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,740
-我想知道他还好吗 -他很好
- I need to know that he is alright. - He is.

945
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,130
-你打算什么时候放了他 -很快
- When will you release him? - Soon.

946
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,490
等到雨水灌满通向大海的河道的时候
When the rain fills the canal that flows to the sea.

947
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,440
如果你们需要什么 联系我
If you need anything.

948
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,610
放了他 尽快
Release him. Soon.

949
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,560
她说什么
What did she say?

950
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,440
她说 你是个好人 霍夫施塔特博士
She said, you're a good man, Doctor Hoffstetler.

951
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,120
我叫迪米特里
My name is Dimitri.

952
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:42,870
很荣幸认识你们
Honored to meet you.

953
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,420
嘿 哑巴 有电话找你
Hey, dummy! Phone call for you.

954
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:48,550
紧急电话
It's urgent.

955
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,950
不用担心我 我很好 相信我 我很好
Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Believe me, I'm fine.

956
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:57,650
 你受伤了

957
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,380
 你在流血

958
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:01,620
他吃了潘多拉 不是他的错
He ate Pandora, it wasn't his fault.

959
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:03,130
野性使然
He's a wild creature.

960
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,160
我们也不能对他有太多的要求
We can't ask him to be anything else.

961
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:08,300
伊莱莎 去找他 去 去
Elisa, Go find him. Go. Go!

962
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:09,920
去啊
Go!

963
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,920
你真走运
You're lucky.

964
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:20,100
我尽量保持清醒
I stayed awake as long as I could

965
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,920
但我现在一把老骨头了
But I'm not even a young man anymore.

966
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,040
他还好吗 你确定吗
Is he alright? You sure?

967
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,640
你去哪 不要走
Where are you going? No, no.

968
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,550
好吧 不 别跟小猫玩
Ok. No, no. Don't play with the kitties.

969
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:37,150
别跟小猫玩
Don't play with the kitties.

970
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,320
我没生气
I'm not angry.

971
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,620
是你干的好事 没事 哦 这样不卫生
You did that. That's okay. Ooh. I don't think that's sanitary.

972
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,140
好了
Enough.

973
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:14,020
他很有意思
Interesting guy.

974
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,660

988
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,920
舍弃一切
Gave it all up...

989
01:21:59,100 --> 01:21:59,880
就为了加入我们
For us.

990
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:06,500
我想你已经准备好离开组织了 嗯
I suppose you're getting ready to leave us now, then, huh?

991
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,460
除非那个生物找不到了
Only if the creature isn't found.

992
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,200
你觉得呢 你觉得我们能找到它吗
What do you think? You think we will find it?

993
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,550
嗯 你说已经有眉目了
Well, you said you had a lead.

994
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,870

01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:42,130
嗯
Mmm.

1004
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,110
永远不要相信男人
Never trust a man.

1005
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,900
就算他看起来像个太监
Even when he looks flat down there.

1006
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,080

1009
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,550
 我有个问题想问你

研究对象

1015
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,450
在你注射了药剂之后

1016
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,350
你是怎么处理它的尸体的

1017
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,110
我有点好奇

1018
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,550
我解剖了尸体

1019
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,610
什么用都没有

1020
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,310
列宁先生曾经说过

1021
01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:01,580
上周剩的鱼 也没什么用了

1022
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,480
列宁

1023
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:07,180
说过吗

1024
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:19,350
蛋糕很好吃

1025
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:21,980
有奶吗

1026
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,250
也许

1027
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:32,350
可能

1028
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,180
是

1029
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,510
你记错了

1030
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,250
等我们电话

1031
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,350
应该不会太久

1032
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:05,370
我刚报了人类学的课
I just signed up in anthropology.

1033
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:07,700
我们要在亚马逊丛林上课了
We're gonna go have classes in the Amazon Jungle...

1034
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:09,350

1035
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,420
哦 兄弟 你明天早上得早点出发
Oh man. You have to get off early in the morning

1036
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,240
走着去可远了呢
That's a long hike.

1037
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,090
-我们要在那定居下来 -是吗
- We're gonna stay down there. - We are?

1038
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,850
哦 不 你不用来
Oh no. You're not coming along too.

1039
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:20,430
这是明胶冻糕
This is a gelatin parfait.

1040
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:22,410
你一定很喜欢
You will love it.

1041
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:24,090
爸爸 我们能看神偷拍档吗
Dad, can we watch Bonanza?

1042
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,460
神偷拍档太暴力了 你知道我今天在想什么吗
Bonanza is much too violent. You know what I was thinking today?

1043
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:28,790
我们给孩子们一个小木
We get the kids a P-U-P-P...

1044
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:49,050
你

1045
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:50,580
跟我

1046
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:52,710
一起

1047
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,020
你们搞什么 水都灌到我影院里去了
What is going on? I've got water pouring into my theater.

1048
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:25,510
我还有四个付费房客呢 我可付不起退款
I have four paying customers. I can't afford a refund.

1049
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:26,940
可能是管道问题 我去修理
It's probably a pipe. I'll take care of it.

1050
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:28,970
-修不好以后就别租了 -能修好的
If you don't fix it. No more renting. - I will fix it.

1051
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,620
伊莱莎
Elisa!

1052
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,300
天啊
Dear God!

1053
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:52,380
伊莱莎
Elisa!

1054
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:23,790
我在擦我的头发
I'm toweling my hair.

1055
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:26,180
是我的头发耶
It's my hair!

1056
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:31,840
还有 还有 看看胳膊 伤口
And... and... look at the arm. The wound.

1057
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:33,970
就像没受过伤一样 你看
As if it was never there. Look at them.

1058
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,190
你说过 他曾被尊为神
You said... He was worshipped like a god.

1059
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:40,480
他是神吗 我不觉得他是什么神 他生吃了一只猫耶
Is he a God? I don't look to him as a God. He ate a cat

1060
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:42,370
我不知道 不知道
So I-I don't know! I don't know!

1061
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,060
我们得让他再待一段时间
We have to keep him around, awhile

1062
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,490
很快
A little while.

1063
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:07,960
喂
Hello?

1064
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,910
抽身文件

1065
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:11,610
准备好了

1066
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:12,950
地点不变

1067
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,780
四十八小时内到

1068
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,080
四十八小时吗

1069
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:22,010
四十八小时

1070
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:50,680
您的水 先生
Your water, Sir.

1071
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,470
-先生 霍伊特将军找您 -别 别
- And, Sir, General Hoyt. - Uh-mm. Uh-mm.

1072
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,290
告诉他 我不在
Tell him I'm not in, tell him

1073
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,900
告诉他 我会给他打回去的 别把他的电话转给我
I will call him back. Don't put him through.

1074
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:01,210
不是的 先生 他就在您办公室
No, Sir. He's in your office.

1075
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,580
眼下我们只担心我们的研究对象
At this point our only concern is the asset.

1076
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,710
抓回来了吗
Do you have it?

1077
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,580
还没有 长官
Still in the wind, sir.

1078
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:12,750
这样可不行啊
That won't do.

1079
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,140
是的 长官 我明白
Yes sir. I know.

1080
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,250
您认识我多久了 长官
You've know me for how long, Sir?

1081
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,370
-三十年 从釜山战役就认识你了 -没错 长官
- Thirteen years. Battle of Pusan. - Yes, sir.

1082
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:27,460
我向来都守信 忠诚 办事高效 一直如此
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient all of his life. All of it

1083
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,190
而且 对国家有用
And he is... useful.

1084
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,020
他期望...
And he expects...

1085
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,230
他期待一定的回报
He has certain expectations in return.

1086
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,580
然后 他失败了
And then... He fails.

1087
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,570
一次 仅此一次
Once. Only once.

1088
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:43,740
那算什么呢
What does that make?

1089
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,860
就此否定他的所有吗
Does that make him a failure?

1090
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:53,610
什么时候才算个头呢 长官 人要证明自己
When is a man done, Sir? Proving himself?

1091
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:55,670
是个好人
A good man.

1092
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,090
是个体面的人
A decent man.

1093
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,890
体面
Decent?

1094
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,550
把事情办妥 才算体面
A man must have the decency not to fuck up.

1095
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:13,220
这是一点
That's one thing.

1096
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,910
这才算真体面
That is real decent of him.

1097
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:20,050
其他方面的体面 不重要
The other kind of decency. It doesn't really matter.

1098
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,200
我们出口商品
We sell it. But it's an export.

1099
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,530
是因为我们用不上
We sell it 'cause we don't use it.

1100
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,240
要么 在三十六小时内解决这件事
36 hours from now, this entire episode will be over.

1101
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,500
要么 就等着被卖出去吧
And so will you.

1102
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:41,310
我们这个世界呢 到时候就只剩下你的一点点印记
Our universe will have a hole in it with your outline.

1103
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:46,680
然后你会到一个平行宇宙去
And you will have moved on to an alternate universe.

1104
01:36:48,460 --> 01:36:49,880
一个乱七八糟的地方
A universe of shit.

1105
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,500
那里没有文明
You will be lost to civilization.

1106
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,540
在那里 你从未出生
And you will be unborn.

1107
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:02,070
从未受过教育
Unmade.

1108
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:05,600
彻底完蛋
Undone.

1109
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:15,090
所以 把自己弄得真正体面一点 孩子
So, go get some real decency, Son.

1110
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:18,110
收拾好这堆烂摊子
And unfuck this mess.

1111
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,100
三十六小时
Thirty-six hours.

1112
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,070
三十六小时
Thirty-six hours.

1113
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,000
说到做到 你要履行诺言
Deliver. You deliver.

1114
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,870
这就是你的工作 说到做到
That's what you do. You deliver, right?

1115
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:02,180
是吧
Right?!

1116
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:33,810
人生不如意十有八九

1117
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,450
鸡蛋

1118
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:50,180
你永远

1119
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:53,280
也不会

1120
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:56,710
知道

1121
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,410

1203
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:31,790
实验室里那东西

-什么在哪 -给我坐下

1206

01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:48,810
如果我知道的话 我一定会说的
If I knew anything I would surely tell you.

1208
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,010
参孙的故事
That story about Samson.

1209
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,240
我没告诉你结尾
I never told you how it ends.

1210
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:03,120
非利士人折磨他 把他弄瞎
After the Philistines torture him and blind him.

1211
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,580
参孙请求上帝赐他力量
Samson asks God for the strength he needs

1212
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,660
在最后一刻 他被宽恕了
And at the last minute, he is spared.

1213
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:13,760
上帝
And the Lord...

1214
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:16,470
把他的力量还给了他
Gives him his strength back.

1215
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,480
最后一次
One last time.

1216
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:27,430
他用有力的双臂
And he holds the columns of the temple

1217
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:32,740
抱住神殿的柱子 把它们压碎了
with his powerful arms and crushes them

1218
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:47,370
让整个神殿都倒塌了 压死了里边所有的非利士人
And he brings the whole building down on the Philistines.

1219
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:58,770
他死了 但是也杀死了那些混蛋
He dies. But he gets every single one of those motherfuckers.

1220
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:01,030
那是他的遗愿
That is his will.

1221
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,130
所以
Now.

1222
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,580
你现在知道我讲这个故事什么意思了吧
Do you know what that particular story means?

1223
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:12,120
迪莱拉
For us, Delilah?

1224
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:15,600
这意味着 就算你现在有事情瞒着我不说
It means that if you know something you're not telling me,

1225
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:16,820
你早晚会说的
you're gonna tell me.

1226
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:21,040
在我毁了神殿
Either before or after...

1227
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:24,330
跟你同归于尽之前
I bring this particular temple...

1228
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:28,100
或者之后
down upon our heads.

1229
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:31,100
她从实验室偷走了那东西
Gal stole that thing right out the lab!

1230
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:32,490
我不知道是什么
Whatever it is.

1231
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:34,760
你把它带走吧
You go took it.

1232
01:49:35,110 --> 01:49:36,070
我听见了
I heard my wife.

1233
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:38,220
听见我老婆在电话里说这事
Talking on the phone about it.

1234
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:46,390
非常感谢你的协助 富勒先生

I got to warn her. He's going after her

1237
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,000
我不许你这么做
You will do no such thing, Woman.

1238
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:08,330
你干嘛处处为她着想 她可触犯了法律
Why you worry about her? She broke the laws

1239
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:10,450
闭嘴 布鲁斯特 你给我闭嘴
Shut up, Brewster! You shut up!

1240
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:12,650
这么多年你都不开口
For years, you don't talk

1241
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:16,020
现在你倒闭不上嘴了
and now you can't shut your mouth.

1242
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,660
去你的 布鲁斯特
Damn you Brewster!

1243
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:22,300
你不会懂的
You wouldn't understand.

1244
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:26,250
你不会懂的 你花一辈子去理解 都不会懂的
You couldn't understand. Not if you tried your whole life

1245
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,360
-喂 -贾尔斯 是你吗

1248
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,830
伊莱莎 如果你能听见就敲敲电话

1249
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:40,230

一起

1262
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:07,510
不 没有我

1263
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:09,810
没有我

1264
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:12,490
我不会失败
I do not fail.

1265
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:15,800
我说到做到
I deliver.

1266
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,930
伊莱莎
Elisa!

1267
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:24,610
伊莱莎
Elisa!

1268
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:34,550
不
No.

1269
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:24,020
妈的
Fuck.

1270
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,430
你真是个神
You are a God.

1271
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,390
如果要我给你讲
If I told you about it

1272
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:37,160
我该说些什么呢
What would I say?

1273
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,140
他们后来幸福地生活在一起吗
That they lived happily ever after?

1274
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,720
我相信如此
I believe it is.

1275
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:44,820
他们彼此深爱
That they were in love

1276
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,820
此情长长久久
That they remained in love.

1277
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:49,030
我很确信
I'm sure that's true.

1278
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:53,980
但每当我想起伊莱莎
But when I think of her, Elisa...

1279
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,280
脑海中都会浮现一首诗
The only thing that comes to mind is a poem

1280
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:02,630
那是几百年前 由一个陷入爱恋的人喃喃而出
Whispered by someone in love, hundreds of years ago...

1281
01:58:03,650 --> 01:58:05,900
我感觉不到你的形状
"Unable to perceive the shape of You"

1282
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:09,410
你围绕着我
"I find You all around me."

1283
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:13,250
你的存在 使我眼中溢满你的爱
"Your presence fills my eyes with your love"

1284
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:16,020
使我内心柔软
"It humbles my heart"

1285
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:18,970
因为你无处不在
"For you are everywhere"
