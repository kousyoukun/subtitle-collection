{\an5}水型物语

16
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,170
If I spoke about it...

17
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,350
If I did...

18
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,960
What would I tell you...

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,740
I wonder?

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,280
Would I tell you about the time...?

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,220
It happened a long time ago, it seems...

22
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,180
In the last days of a fair prince's reign.

23
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,110
Or would I tell you about the place?

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,590
A small city near the coast...

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,150
But far from everything else.

26
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,050
Or... i don't know...

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,880
Would I tell you about her?

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,590
The princess without voice.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,440
Or perhaps I would just warn you...

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
About the truth of these facts...

31
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,850
And the tale of love and loss...

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,740
And the monster...

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,220
Who tried to destroy it all.

34
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,090
I have sinned.

35
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,030
I've offended the god.

36
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,700
I'm deep in sin, my lord Hedak.

37
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,440
Let me judge of that.

38
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,600
I've doubted the ceremony of the sacrifice.

39
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,310
I don't wanna go upstairs.

40
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,140
Why, everybody's got to go upstairs, miss Lloyd,

41
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,990
If they wants to go to bed.

42
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,300
The sirens wake you up?

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,330
It was a fire. The chocolate factory.

44
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,500
Could you smell that?

45
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,870
Oh, my. Toasted cocoa.

46
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,380
Tragedy and delight... hand in hand.

47
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,720
Oh, my dear child.

48
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,080
I would waste away if you weren't here looking after me.

49
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,140
I am the proverbial starving...

50
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,990
Oh, watch this.

51
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,730
It's bojangles. The stair dance.

52
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,840
Oh, that's so hard.

53
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,130
Cagney did it. Different but beautiful.

54
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,070
I wanna do that too.

55
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,780
All right.

56
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,340
- Are you ready? - Yup.

57
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,270
Come on.

58
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,340
Ah!

59
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,330
Say, you catch on quick.

60
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,740
Elisa!

61
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,490
Next time you come to bring the rent...

62
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,610
I want you to stay and see the bible movie, eh?

63
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,670
Okay, I have two free tickets here.

64
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,120
You bring your neighbor giles. He's a good boy.

65
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,190
Bible movie and comedy. Nobody's going to the theater, huh?

66
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,320
I-I throw in a free popcorn and soda!

67
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,100
Oh, no, burgassi, there's two s's there!

68
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,180
Come on!

69
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,530
Two s's, mardi grass! Mardi grass!

70
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,430
All personnel, be advised that sector 12.

71
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,060
Has now been cleared to level a-c

72
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,350
Elisa!

73
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,000
Come on! I'm here already.

74
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,510
You gotta learn to be on time.

75
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,060
Hey, what you doing?

76
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,550
- Don't cut in, dummy! - Leave her alone, woman.

77
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,660
I was keeping her place.

78
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,150
I get reported, I come after you and the mute.

79
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,870
You do that, yolanda.

80
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
You do that.

81
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,360
Ugh.

82
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,540
My feet are already killin' me.

83
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,990
I made brewster pigs in a blanket tonight before leavin'.

84
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
And boy, he just ate 'em up.

85
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,030
No thank you's, no yum yums. Not a peep.

86
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,810
Man is as silent as a grave.

87
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,910
But if farts were flattery,

88
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,540
Honey, he'd be shakespeare.

89
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,120
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

90
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,540
Eggs, bacon, and buttered toast.

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,580
I butter the man's toast, elisa.

92
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,610
Mm-hmm, both sides. As if he was a child.

93
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,310
And I don't even get a "thank you."

94
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,920
You'd be grateful.

95
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,870
Because you're an educated woman.

96
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,770
But my brewster? All he had going for him.

97
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,020
Was animal magnetism back in the day.

98
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,530
Hadn't worked in a while.

99
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,300
What in the sam hill?

100
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,480
Lou!

101
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,530
You boys mind putting the trash in the can?

102
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,030
That's what it's there for.

103
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,580
Hard to believe, huh? That's what it's there for.

104
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,560
All right, all right. Sorry zelda. Sorry.

105
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,190
I don't know what they're doin'.

106
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,960
Makin' a goddamn mess is what I'd say...

107
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,940
Zelda!

108
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,200
- Stop the chatter please. - Yes, sir.

109
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,460
And there's no call for the blasphemy.

110
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,170
Sorry, mr. Fleming, sir.

111
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,190
Mhmm, a moment of your time.

112
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,050
Today, we are receiving a new team and asset here in t-4.

113
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,160
This is dr. Robert hoffstetler from

114
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,800
our sister facility bolster or..

115
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,880
Now, I don't want to bolster or...

116
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,700
Overstate the matter but...

117
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,960
This may very well be the most sensitive asset.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,430
Ever to be housed in this facility.

119
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,800
- How was your trip? - Fine.

120
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,590
- Who's security here? - Just one moment, please.

121
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,060
Security! Who's security?

122
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,780
Welcome to the t-4, sir.

123
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,010
I'm fleming, head of security.

124
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
Any questions you have or concerns you can refer to me.

125
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,910
Understand? I'll be in charge from now on.

126
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,740
Get them out.

127
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,160
Help me move the cylinder into the compressor.

128
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,920
Bring it here, bring it here.

129
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,690
Bring it over here.

130
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,570
We need to pressurize it immediately.

131
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,500
Elisa, elisa!

132
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,960
Come on.

133
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,310
Lord, what goes on in this place?

134
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,960
Did you see that?

135
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,160
Yes, I'm wearing the hairpiece. How's it look?

136
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh, careful, the car.

137
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,740
It's not a hairpiece, it's a toupee. It's French.

138
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,850
It's eternal, see?

139
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,140
Tantalus never achieved the escape of death.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,810
'Cause the fruit on the branches

141
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,670
was just always out of his reach.

142
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,110
And the water in the stream receded every time.

143
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,500
Stooped down to drink.

144
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,830
And so, that's why we say things today, like...

145
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,510
Look at those tantalizing pies.

146
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,410
Thank you. You'll come back now, you hear?

147
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,450
Yes, pies for breakfast. Just trust me on this.

148
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,980
Hey, folks, welcome to dixie doug's.

149
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,570
I've seen you in here before, right?

150
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,380
Yes, I've been here a couple of times, as a matter of fact.

151
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,000
Partial to key lime pie?

152
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,790
I am, I am. Two to go.

153
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,600
Just go with it, please, please.

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Uh, I uh, it's a craving that I indulge in.

155
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,070
It can't possibly be good for me but nothing I like is.

156
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,860
No, no, it's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

157
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,230
You wouldn't happen to be the uh,

158
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,840
Famous dixie doug himself, would you?

159
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,410
Heck, no. Pies are trucked throughout the country.

160
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,310
They call it uh, "franchising", see?

161
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,060
Oh.

162
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,830
They give us the spinners, the signage.

163
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,830
That there's "pie boy", our mascot.

164
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,950
I don't talk like that. I'm from ottawa.

165
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,330
No.

166
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,290
I completely bought it.

167
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
"That's-a great-a pie."

168
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,960
The...

169
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,320
The uh, the little-little guy. Is he supposed to be italian?

170
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,960
I guess so.

171
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,640
That was very clever.

172
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,980
You'll come back now, you hear?

173
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,080
"You'll come back now."

174
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,490
Do you think he meant it?

175
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,920
He had noticed me. I mean, you s... you heard that.

176
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,190
This pie is rather sordid.

177
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,670
Don't spit it out.

178
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,360
Next time we go, we'll just try a different flavor.

179
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,630
Hmm?

180
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,950
Save it for later. For the wait.

181
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,190
The clocks point to 6 a.m. eastern standard time.

182
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,760
The skies are beginning to lighten.

183
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,180
And a cool north wind rustles across the...

184
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,620
Groups of negroes have been

185
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,340
swarming in front.

186
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,840
Oh, dear god, change that awfulness.

187
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,510
I do not want to see that.

188
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,500
I do not want to see it.

189
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,370
That's better, that's better.

190
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,290
Oh, look at betty!

191
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
Oh, to be young and beautiful.

192
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,420
If I could go back...

193
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,090
To when I was 18...

194
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,530
I didn't know anything about anything...

195
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

196
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,250
I would say,

197
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,280
Take better care of your teeth and fuck.

198
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,630
A lot more.

199
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,510
Oh, no, no, that's very good advice.

200
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,660
Will you look at this?

201
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,660
Look.

202
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,790
Some of the best minds in the country.

203
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,010
Peeing all over the floor in this here facility.

204
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,120
Mm-mm-mm.

205
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,650
There's pee freckles on the ceilin' there!

206
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,500
How'd they get it up there?

207
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Just how big a target do they need, you figure?

208
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,900
They get enough practice that's for sure.

209
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,460
My brewster...

210
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,940
No one's ever called him a great mind.

211
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,060
But...

212
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,740
Even he manages to hit the can seventy percent of the time.

213
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,870
- Excuse us, sir. - No, no, no. That's all right.

214
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,400
Go ahead.

215
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,350
You ladies seem to be chatting enjoyably.

216
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,580
Girl talk no doubt.

217
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,790
Don't mind me.

218
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,230
Elisa...

219
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,820
Look, don't touch.

220
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,720
That lovely dingus right there is an alabama howdy-do.

221
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,980
Molded grip handle.

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,050
Low-current, high-voltage electric shock cattle prod.

223
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,490
Name's strickland. Security.

224
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,270
Fleming's security.

225
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,660
Ha!

226
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,140
Oh, no, no. A man washes his hands.

227
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,340
Before or after tending to his needs.

228
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,340
It tells you a lot about a man.

229
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,480
He does it both times...

230
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,340
Points to a weakness in character.

231
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,290
Ladies.

232
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,270
It was very pleasant chatting with you both.

233
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,630
Short people are mean.

234
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,750
I never met a short man that

235
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,400
stayed nice all.

236
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,070
No, sir.

237
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,380
Mean little backstabbers, all of 'em.

238
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,120
Maybe it's the air down there.

239
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,950
Not enough oxygen or somethin'.

240
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Hmm.

241
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,270
Help! He's losing blood!

242
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,210
Help!

243
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,510
Come on, come on.

244
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,170
You think the russians broke in?

245
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,840
I don't think so. And if they did...

246
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,270
Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

247
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,190
It was two shots. D'you hear 'em?

248
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,410
All right, three.

249
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,570
And that scream.

250
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,210
Lord, whatever happens in this place.

251
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,320
You two, come with me.

252
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,620
Right now? Mr. fleming, sir?

253
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,850
Any chance we could... conclude our dinner?

254
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,710
Now.

255
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,880
Oh, heavens to betsy. We are in a pickle.

256
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,940
We are in such a pickle.

257
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,600
You will have exactly 20 minutes.

258
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,470
To render this-this lab immaculate.

259
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,170
And so on and so forth. 20 minutes.

260
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,400
It's a lot of blood. What went on in here?

261
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,190
I can handle pee.

262
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,730
I can handle poo.

263
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,430
But blood, mm.

264
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,550
Blood just does somethin' to me.

265
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,980
Here, honey... help me mop it up.

266
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,880
The sooner we get outta here, the better.

267
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,430
Is that a tater tot?

268
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,440
Oh!

269
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,120
It's a finger.

270
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,430
It's two fingers, okay.

271
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,500
Okay, okay. Put 'em away, and... just wait here.

272
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,990
I'm gonna get mr. Fleming.

273
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,330
Where are these body parts?

274
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,660
The body parts?

275
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,360
No, I believe you, honey. Are you sure it was alive?

276
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,160
Because I saw a mermaid once in a carnival tent.

277
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,620
And it was a monkey.

278
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,470
Sewn to the tail of a fish. Looked real to me!

279
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,670
All right, I apologize.

280
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,460
I have a deadline.

281
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
You know, uh...

282
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,870
Corn flakes were invented to prevent masturbation.

283
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,220
Didn't work.

284
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,910
Oh, alice faye just started.

285
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,760
She was a huge star, huge.

286
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,230
And one day, she couldn't take the

287
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,790
bullshit and the backstabbing anymore.

288
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,430
She just walked away from it all.

289
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,070
Ta-da.

290
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,420
It's not bad, is it?

291
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,980
For being shit.

292
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,570
Uh, listen, you eat, you go to bed, you rest.

293
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,550
And when i... get paid...

294
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,630
We get pie.

295
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,200
No, we don't get pie. I get pie.

296
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,970
You get whatever you want.

297
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,300
Wish me luck.

298
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,170
Green.

299
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,210
They want the gelatin to be green now.

300
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,670
- I was told red. - New concept.

301
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,850
That's the future now. Green.

302
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,250
Oh, and they want the... them happier, the family.

303
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,180
- Happier? Happier? - Mm.

304
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,130
The father looks like he just

305
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,210
discovered the missionary position.

306
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,300
Giles!

307
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,210
Well, uh, what are they supposed to be happy about?

308
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,940
The client wanted photographs. I sold them on this.

309
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,280
It's too bad. This is nice work.

310
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,110
It is nice, isn't it? I think it's one of my best.

311
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,340
How you holdin' up?

312
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,680
- You drinking? - No.

313
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,060
Not a drop. No.

314
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,340
Getting any work since you left klein & saunders?

315
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,260
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

316
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,640
We are not getting into this now.

317
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,680
I want to come back, bernie.

318
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,400
We'll see.

319
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,160
Now do this.

320
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,470
Good work.

321
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,680
Elisa!

322
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,320
What are you doing in there?

323
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,030
Cleaning, huh.

324
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,410
Listen, honey.

325
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,610
Mr. "I pee with my hands on my hips" wants to see us both.

326
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,800
Zelda d. Fuller.

327
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,110
How long have you two known each other, zelda?

328
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,100
Uh, about ten years, sir.

329
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,830
No siblings, zelda?

330
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,180
No, sir.

331
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,660
That's not common, is it? For your people?

332
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
My momma died after me.

333
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,470
After I was born.

334
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,700
What does that "d" stand for?

335
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,880
Delilah... sir.

336
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,770
On account of the bible.

337
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,000
Delilah, she betrayed samson.

338
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,460
Lulled him to sleep. Cut his hair.

339
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,100
Philistines tortured him, humiliated him.

340
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,710
Burned his eyes out.

341
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,170
Guess my momma didn't read the good book close enough.

342
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,650
And you...

343
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,700
Elisa... esposito.

344
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,780
Doesn't Esposito mean orphanage?

345
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,270
Oh, our lady of sorrows orphanage in putnam.

346
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,090
They found her by the river... in the water.

347
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,240
It was you that found my fingers.

348
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,570
Oh.

349
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,090
Thanks.

350
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,240
Three hours in surgery.

351
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,340
They rebuilt the first phalanx here.

352
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,960
Sutured the tendons.

353
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,790
Don't know if it's gonna take or not.

354
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,330
There was mustard on them.

355
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,350
- A paper bag? - It was all we had, sir.

356
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,030
I answer mostly, on account that she can't talk.

357
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,560
She can't? She deaf?

358
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,670
Mute, sir.

359
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,850
She said she can hear you.

360
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,460
Oh, those scars on your neck.

361
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,530
That's what did it. Cut your voice box, right?

362
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,500
She said since she was a baby.

363
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,250
Who would do that to a baby?

364
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,690
The world is sinful.

365
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,730
Do you say so, delilah?

366
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,070
Well, let me say this upfront.

367
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,120
You clean that lab. You get out.

368
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,100
The thing we keep in there, is an affront.

369
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,180
Do you know what an affront is, zelda?

370
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,150
Something offensive.

371
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,320
That's right. And I should know, I dragged that...

372
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,300
Filthy thing...

373
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,770
Out of the river muck in south america all the way here.

374
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,910
And along the way, we didn't get to like each other much.

375
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,900
Now... you may think...

376
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,830
That thing looks human.

377
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,430
Stands on two legs, right?

378
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
But, we're created in the lord's image.

379
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,880
You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?

380
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,870
I wouldn't know, Sir. What the Lord looks like.

381
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,870
Well, human, zelda. He looks like a human. Like me.

382
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,860
Or even you.

383
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,410
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

384
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,580
Well, that's all.

385
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,000
General hoyt. Thank you for calling me back, sir.

386
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,440
- Feeling better? - Oh, yes, sir, much better.

387
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,020
- Pain pills, is all. - You lost two fingers, was it?

388
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,220
Two fingers, yeah. He got two fingers.

389
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,020
But I still got my thumb, my trigger and my pussy finger.

390
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,930
Sounds to me like you'll be all right then.

391
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,650
Yes, sir, that's right. Looking forward to your visit, sir.

392
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,210
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

393
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,340
Some fruity pies await you.

394
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,480
Three new locations in downtown baltimore.

395
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,900
The future is here.

396
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,410
Get some rest.

397
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,410
Pick me up at nine thrity

398
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,380
twenty one hundred and thrity hours. Yes, sir.

399
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,290
Dixie dougs. That's-a great-a pie.

400
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,070
I'm home.

401
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,230
I made you an omelette.

402
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,340
- Hey, dad. Guess what? - No pancakes?

403
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,440
I've gone through half the boxes,

404
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,380
and I can't find out the griddle.

405
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,090
Guess what?

406
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,120
I made you cheese and broccoli omelette.

407
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,250
How're you feeling? Does it hurt?

408
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,610
- A little bit. Pills help. - Guess what?

409
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,300
- What? - We are burying a time capsule.

410
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,350
At the new school. I wanted to ask you.

411
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,520
Do you think we'll all have jet packs?

412
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,070
- In the future? - Believe it, son.

413
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,630
Oh, bus is here.

414
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,340
This is america.

415
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,230
- Bye, dad. - Bye, dad.

416
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,650
Finish you omelette then wash your hands real good.

417
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,260
And come upstairs, sweetie.

418
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,510
I kinda like it here. The kids like the lawn.

419
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,870
Plus, D.C. is just half an hour away, isn't it?

420
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,870
It is still Baltimore, Elaine. No one likes Baltimore.

421
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,430
You know what I'm thinkin'?

422
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,010
I'm thinkin'... i need a new car.

423
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,010
You need a new car, do you?

424
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,400
How about a cadillac, mister?

425
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,620
Richard.

426
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,970
Oh.

427
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,470
Oh.

428
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,820
Oh, richard.

429
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,870
Uh.

430
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,050
Oh. Uh.

431
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,070
Oh.

432
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,380
Swee... sweetie?

433
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,490
Sweetie, you're um...

434
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,570
Your-your hand, it's bleeding.

435
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,840
Silence, stop talking.

436
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,700
Don't talk. I want you in silence.

437
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,440
Silent. Silent.

438
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,540
Yes... yes, silence.

439
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,160
Dr. levinson. Aeronautics. Dr. levinson. Aeronautics.

440
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,510
- On the window... - what?!

441
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,340
The sparrow...!

442
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,000
Nests... on the window... sill!

443
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,970
- And the eagle takes the prey! - What?!

444
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,590
Elisa, hurry, hurry. Come on.

445
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,580
Sweet god, girl.

446
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,910
You're doing it again, zelda.

447
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,880
Oh, give it a rest, yolanda.

448
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Oh!

449
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,100
Whew!

450
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,700
Hey, zelda, want a smoke?

451
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,400
- That shit ain't good for you, duane.

452
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,060
- Yeah, but I feel good.

453
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,490
It does, doesn't it?

454
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,060
Come on, elisa, just one.

455
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,720
Come on, come on, come on.

456
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,800
Don't worry about that camera. We push him up at break time.

457
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,630
- Mmhmm. - This here's a blind spot.

458
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,450
Fleming, I have to finish some things in here.

459
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,100
Fetch mcdonald, will ya?

460
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,510
Aw, you miss me, huh?

461
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,730
I took a candy break.

462
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,380
This is what scares you, huh?

463
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,380
Gee, you should be used to it by now.

464
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,120
There you go again, makin' that god-awful sound.

465
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,660
Is that you cryin', huh? Is that what it is?

466
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,070
Are you hurtin'?

467
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,170
Or maybe...

468
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,800
You're angry?!

469
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,720
Maybe you'd like to get another bite, huh? Go ahead.

470
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,780
Huh?!

471
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,540
I can't tell!

472
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,880
I mean, are you beggin'?

473
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,480
'Cause to me, it's just the worst

474
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,380
fucking noise I've ever heard.

475
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,900
Paging captain walters.

476
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,900
Captain walters. Please pick up the courtesy phone.

477
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,480
Elisa...

478
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,660
Elisa?

479
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,540
General hoyt! Welcome, sir.

480
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,580
Everything's ready. Glad to have you, sir.

481
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,410
- Good to see you, son. - Thank you.

482
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,970
Good god almighty. Is that it?

483
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,690
Hell of a lot bigger than I thought.

484
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,230
Ugly as sin.

485
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,960
You know, the natives in the

486
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,870
amazon worship him as the god.

487
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,390
Doesn' t look like much of a God right now, does it?

488
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,310
Well, they were primitives, sir.

489
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,340
You know, they would toss offerings into the water.

490
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,260
Flowers, fruits, crap like that.

491
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,370
Then they tried to stop the oil drill with bows and arrows.

492
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,860
That didn't turn out too well.

493
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,730
He's bleeding.

494
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,010
What happened?

495
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,000
It's an animal, Hoffstetler. Just keepin' it tame.

496
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,770
What the hell have we got here, son?

497
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,700
This creature, sir...

498
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,600
It can alternate between two entirely

499
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,100
separate breath

500
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,100
- mudskipper can do that. - No.

501
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,510
Look, you want to put a man in space.

502
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,480
He's gonna have to endure conditions

503
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,300
the human body just wasn't made for.

504
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,660
This gives us an edge against the soviets.

505
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,450
How long can it breathe outside the water?

506
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,940
The reality is, sir, we don't

507
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,490
know jackshit about this thing.

508
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,590
Well, the soviets want it. We know that much.

509
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,340
Those cockeyed bastards.

510
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,090
You know, we let them send a dog up into space...

511
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,450
And we get a good laugh.

512
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,790
Then the next thing you know, they send a human up.

513
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,690
A ruskie, orbiting the planet, doing god knows what?

514
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,510
Who's laughing then? Krushchev, that's who.

515
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,650
We let him put a dog up into space...

516
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,900
And he laughs then puts a commie up in space.

517
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,630
And he laughs, and then he puts missiles into cuba.

518
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,570
Have we learned nothing?

519
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,620
Sir, we need to get him back in the water.

520
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,740
See, these scientists, they're like artists, sir.

521
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,840
They fall in love with their playthings.

522
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,200
Now, right here, see, along the middle?

523
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,830
This creature has a thick, jointed cartilage.

524
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,110
That separates the primary and secondary lungs.

525
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,760
Am I explaining this correctly, bob?

526
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,140
Yes, but we have

527
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,030
-been able to determine...

528
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,170
-it makes the x-ray.

529
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,630
In principle, sir, yes, but...

530
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,950
- there are ways of... - now, I believe, if we wanna.

531
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,720
Get the edge on the soviets, we need to vivisect this thing.

532
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,560
No, no.

533
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,140
- Take it apart, learn how it works. - No.

534
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,400
No! That would defeat the purpose!

535
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,340
Sir, he's passed out, please.

536
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,650
Put him in the tank! Let him pressurize.

537
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,840
General hoyt, sir!

538
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,190
You cannot, under any circumstance, kill this creature.

539
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,840
Count these stars with me, son.

540
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,590
There're five of 'em.

541
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,810
Means I can do whatever the hell I want.

542
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,260
Now, you wanna plead your case? I'll listen to it.

543
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,970
But at the end of the day...

544
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,140
It is my damn decision.

545
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,120
So crack the damn thing open.

546
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,630
Learn what you can and close up shop here.

547
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,670
And give yourself a good pat on the back, strickland.

548
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,730
- You've done it. - Thank you, sir.

549
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,870
Now, hurry up and finish the job, son.

550
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,470
Absolutely, sir.

551
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,080
Get him out? What are you talking about?

552
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,450
No, absolutely not.

553
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,670
Because it's breaking the law, that's why.

554
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,900
Probably breaking the law just talking about it.

555
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,640
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

556
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,620
Now, does this mean that...

557
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,370
Whenever we go to a chinese restaurant,

558
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,680
You want to save every fish in the tank?

559
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,620
So what if he's alone?

560
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,040
We're all alone.

561
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,110
"The loneliest thing you've ever seen."

562
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,880
Well, you just said it, right, you just said it.

563
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,980
You called it a "thing." it's a thing. It's a freak.

564
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,640
I can understand you.

565
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,300
Calm down.

566
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,540
God, calm d...

567
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,810
All right, I-i will repeat it to you.

568
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,800
"What am I?"

569
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,200
"I move my mouth."

570
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,940
"like him."

571
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,980
"I make no sound."

572
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,210
"like him."

573
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,570
"what does that make me?"

574
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,420
"all that I am..."

575
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,100
"all that I've ever been..."

576
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,230
"brought me here"

577
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,600
"to him."

578
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,720
See, you're saying "him." it's a "him" now.

579
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:24,800
It's a h...

580
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,020
Ah! You just hit me.

581
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,950
Elisa, let go of me.

582
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,990
I'm looking, I'm looking. You've never... hit me!

583
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,310
"When he looks at me..."

584
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,700
"the way he looks at me..."

585
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,790
"he does not know..."

586
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,900
"what I lack..."

587
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,990
"or..."

588
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,230
"how..."

589
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,940
"I am incomplete."

590
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,130
"he... sees me..."

591
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,380
"for what i... am..."

592
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,280
"as I am."

593
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,250
"he's happy."

594
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,180
"to see me."

595
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,730
"every time."

596
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,910
"everyday."

597
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,680
"now..."

598
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,360
"I can... either..."

599
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,080
"save him..."

600
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,260
"or let him die."

601
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,090
Okay.

602
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,870
I'm leaving.

603
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,680
I have to... I have to leave.

604
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,610
Just, elisa, please stop.

605
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,290
Listen to me, just listen to me.

606
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,450
I have to go.

607
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,810
I have to... I'm leaving now because this...

608
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,270
Elisa, this is very important to me.

609
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,840
This is a second chance for me.

610
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,650
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

611
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,020
Oh, god.

612
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,040
When I come back,

613
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,810
We just will not talk about this ever again.

614
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,520
Elisa, there's...

615
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,030
Oh, all right.

616
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,600
What are we? What are you and I?

617
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,380
Do you know what we are? We are nothing.

618
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,810
Nothing. We can do nothing.

619
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,540
I'm sorry.

620
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,900
But this, this, this is just...

621
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,660
Oh, god, It's not even human.

622
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,680
God.

623
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,230
What?

624
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,540
Giles!

625
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
I've been waiting.

626
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,590
- I know, sorry. - It's okay.

627
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,320
We going in?

628
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,600
You should've just mailed the art.

629
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,750
No. I want to show it to you and the team in person.

630
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,210
I think It's some of my best work.

631
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,290
And It's green as can be.

632
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,080
It's uh, It's not a good time.

633
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,790
Maybe later.

634
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,470
Oh, well, sure. No problem.

635
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,680
What would be a good time for you, Bernie?

636
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,720
You painted that?

637
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,040
Yeah.

638
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,930
Wowee.

639
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,560
You're good.

640
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,730
Well, apparently, not as good as a photograph.

641
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,520
But it is good, isn't it?

642
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,540
I couldn't paint anything like that.

643
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,690
Here... on me.

644
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,030
For me?

645
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,660
We don't get many like you in here.

646
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,510
You seem... very educated.

647
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,150
I like talkin' to you.

648
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,320
The-the thing is, that's the...

649
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,510
The only reason that I come in here is...

650
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,420
The conversation! And...

651
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,560
The pie is mighty fine too, isn't it?

652
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,770
Yeah. Yeah.

653
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,320
It's no key lime, but... It's good.

654
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,480
You know I work alone...

655
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,430
And uh...

656
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,300
My best friend's not much of a conversationalist.

657
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,290
You see, that's part of being the job here, It's like...

658
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,600
Being a bartender.

659
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,350
You serve people pie, you listen to their problems.

660
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,640
You get to know 'em.

661
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,920
I'd like to get to know you better.

662
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,480
The hell are you doing, old man?

663
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,560
Oh, o-o-oh.

664
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,420
Hey, no, no, no. Not the counter.

665
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,830
Take out only. You can't sit there.

666
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,820
You want something, you order, you take it out.

667
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,820
But It's empty... the-the counter's empty...

668
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,140
They're all reserved all day. You don't sit down.

669
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,190
Y'all come back now, y'hear?

670
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,140
You didn't need to talk to them like that.

671
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,530
You should go too.

672
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,000
And don't come back. This is a family restaurant.

673
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,300
I have no one.

674
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,250
And you are the only person that I can talk to.

675
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,230
Now...

676
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,230
Whatever this thing is...

677
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,200
You need it.

678
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,220
So...

679
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,310
You just tell me what to do.

680
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,780
All hope fades...

681
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,320
As the spring recedes. Let's go.

682
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,180
Cadillac deville. Best car ever made.

683
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,570
V8, 390 cid, clean and crisp like a fresh dollar bill.

684
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,270
- I'm just idling around. - And I'm just talking.

685
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,090
Am radio, air conditioner, power windows, power brakes,

686
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,940
Power steering, power seats...

687
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,350
All deluxe interior appointment choices.

688
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,020
143 options. Now this...

689
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,270
It's the taj-mahal on wheels.

690
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,200
Hm.

691
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,970
I'm not sure about the green.

692
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,530
No, It's not green, my friend. Teal.

693
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,720
- Well, teal looks green to me. - But it isn't, see?

694
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,750
It's a limited edition. Twelve coats of paint.

695
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,920
Polished by hand. All authentic chrome detailing.

696
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,150
Four out of five successful men in America drive a Cadillac.

697
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,660
- Is that a fact? - This here is the future.

698
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,780
And you strike me as a man who is headed there.

699
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,680
- Where? - Why, the future.

700
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,110
You're the man of the future.

701
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,930
You belong in this car.

702
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,180
Wow!

703
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,910
Sir, that is a-that is a beautiful car!

704
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,620
It's uh...

705
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,020
What can I say? You gotta feel good drivin' that, huh?

706
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,540
And what a wonderful shade of green, huh?

707
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,030
Teal.

708
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,580
Teal.

709
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,540
- Tomorrow... - Mmm?

710
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,830
- I'll make a melaleuca meatloaf. - Mm-hmm..

711
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,610
Just for you, extra raisins.

712
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,040
So at 5:00 a.m. I drive my car down the loading ramp.

713
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,190
And uh, the shifts are changing and I...

714
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,610
How much time do I have?

715
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,880
Five minutes? I'll remember, yeah,

716
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,860
Five a.m., five minutes, five-five, five-five.

717
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,670
So, y-you're gonna move the cameras, right.

718
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,470
And uh, I'm gonna be synchronizing our watches.

719
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,030
Just like they do in the movies.

720
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,820
Oh, god, I'm so proud of you.

721
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,200
God! You just-you're not afraid!

722
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,910
You are? Very?

723
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,770
Don't tell me that. I'm terrified.

724
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,140
I think this is some of my best work.

725
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,980
"Michael Parker" is a good

726
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,540
trustworthy name. It's a little butch.

727
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,320
Yes, age fifty-one.

728
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,760
Fifty four.

729
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,780
You don't have to be rude.

730
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,240
Fifty... seven.

731
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,940
I put the hair on. I can pull it off.

732
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,700
I can wear this or I ha.

733
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,640
Oh, go, go, off, off, off, off. Go, go.

734
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,230
Or I have this. Now this...

735
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,020
This I think it says, "working man."

736
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,850
But this, now this, this says...

737
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,480
This says, with the butterscotch tie...

738
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,130
This says, "casual" but still stylish.

739
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,320
So... you like this? I agree. I agree.

740
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,830
I think we're ready.

741
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,780
Mr. Strickland!

742
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,340
Sally, could you call Miss Esposito to clean up a spill?

743
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,290
You know, I can't figure it out myself.

744
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,190
You're not much to look at, but...

745
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,330
Go figure.

746
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,170
I keep thinking about you.

747
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,510
And when you say you're mute, are you entirely silent, or...

748
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,070
Do you squawk a little?

749
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,190
Some mutes squawk. Not pretty... hmm?

750
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,650
I just want you to know...

751
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,300
I don't mind those scars.

752
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,890
I don't mind that you can't speak, either.

753
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,270
When you come right down to it...

754
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,550
I like it.

755
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,680
A lot.

756
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,280
Kind of gets me going.

757
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,750
I bet I can make you squawk a little.

758
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,010
Hey, honey, you okay?

759
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,280
Hurry up, I want to be home early.

760
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,250
My feet are killing me.

761
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,470
We need to delay the procedure.

762
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,330
Knock before you enter my office.

763
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,730
This is urgent!

764
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,890
Go back out. Knock.

765
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,450
Then I'll let you in and we'll talk.

766
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,520
That's the protocol. Follow the protocol.

767
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:13,920
Come in.

768
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,770
I...

769
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,380
Could you get the door for me, please?

770
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,130
See? That's the way. Now we talk.

771
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,520
I need more time.

772
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,090
Don't let the fact that you feel like a loser now,

773
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,880
That you let your competitive tendency...

774
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:30,930
I'm not competitive!

775
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,280
I don't want an intricate, beautiful thing destroyed.

776
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:42,050
This thing dies. You learn. I leave.

777
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,200
Outta here. I settle down.

778
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,940
My family settles down. Somewhere nice. A real city.

779
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,630
This creature is intelligent.

780
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,400
Capable of language...

781
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,270
Of understanding emotions.

782
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,270
So are the soviets, the gooks.

783
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,300
And we still kill them, don't we?

784
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,950
The bottom line is, this isn't a petting zoo.

785
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,840
And I don't want to be in this

786
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,820
shithole any longhe investigation.

787
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,200
Do you?

788
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,080
Bob...

789
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,430
Do you?

790
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,440
No, I don't.

791
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,830
Hey, what are you waiting for?

792
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,070
Have you seen Elisa?

793
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,920
Come on, Zelda.

794
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,970
Did you move the camera? On the loading dock?

795
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,810
Is that where you're taking him?

796
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,060
Through the service tunnel?

797
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,700
That's very smart.

798
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,020
Who do you work for?

799
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,520
This water must be kept at five to eight percent salinity.

800
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,990
Table salt will do.

801
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:42,100
Mix one of these in his water every three days.

802
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,440
Raw protein diet is a must.

803
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,590
In five minutes, I'll meet you at the loading dock.

804
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,300
The lights will go out, so be prepared.

805
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,610
M-mr. Strickland, sir...

806
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,880
Twelve hours to the vivisection of the asset, and to...

807
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,190
I-I need your signature here, please.

808
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,370
Hold it right there.

809
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,690
Michael parker. Is that you?

810
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,500
My whole life.

811
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,220
Are you out of your mind?

812
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,230
Don't do this, Elisa.

813
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,890
Don't do this!

814
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,030
What's that... what's that vehicle?

815
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:31,430
Uh, gosh, sir, I'm not sure, It's... a laundry van?

816
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,230
B-but it's-it's not scheduled.

817
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,090
Sir!

818
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,930
- Meet me at the loading dock. - Sir!

819
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,600
- Sir, what do you need me to... - Get backup.

820
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,650
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

821
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:09,890
Oh, god, I'm not good at this.

822
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,340
Out of the vehicle, now!

823
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,520
I will not say it again.

824
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,980
- God, please don't shoot me. - Get out!

825
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,360
Oh, god, don't shoot me.

826
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,030
What are you waiting for? We're out of time.

827
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,640
Get out now!

828
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,070
We have to go. Hurry!

829
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,190
Oh, woman, we're gonna burn in hell!

830
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,690
Come on, push!

831
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,050
Push!

832
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:40,300
Push!

833
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,380
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

834
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,840
Mechanical objects and I just don't get along!

835
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:50,620
What?

836
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,240
She's waiting for you at the dock.

837
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,650
- Go! Now! - Okay, hold on.

838
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,860
Who's that man? I think he just killed someone.

839
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,680
Oh!

840
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,080
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

841
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,430
Are we ready? Are we ready?

842
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,370
He's so beautiful.

843
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,700
Did I do that?

844
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,710
I'm just not good at this.

845
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,570
Move! Move!

846
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:40,620
No...

847
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,990
No!

848
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:09,300
Salt? What are you talking about? Salt.

849
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,140
Elisa!

850
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,870
Israeli "popper."

851
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,600
Smell the magnesium?

852
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,780
The Russians hate the Jews,

853
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,740
but can't get enough of their gadgets.

854
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,020
How'd they get in here?

855
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,900
Oh, uh, forged id, painted plates,

856
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,310
and uh, so on.

857
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,000
And they moved the main video camera on the dock, sir.

858
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,980
Well, no one has to know. We got 24 hours before I bounce it up.

859
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,870
I called it in.

860
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,250
- You called it in? - The moment it happened, I-I-I...

861
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,370
Mr. Strickland, sir.

862
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:55,330
What is it, Sally?

863
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,880
Sir, General Hoyt is on the phone.

864
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,850
That thing was our space dog, Strickland.

865
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,280
- You know that. - Sir, I'm getting it back.

866
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,830
I don't... I can't be in a negative frame of mind, sir.

867
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,250
So you're feeling good?

868
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,270
Feeling strong. Getting it back.

869
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,060
You can get it done. You're gonna get it done.

870
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,900
For me, son. For me.

871
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,120
That's when you're planning on releasing him?

872
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,900
On the tenth?

873
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,240
So what if the rains are late?

874
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,970
What happens with the canal?

875
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,670
All right.

876
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,020
What's that?

877
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,280
Let me see it.

878
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,990
Is that for me?

879
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:01,600
Yeah. That's good. Keep that up.

880
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,100
Lookin' like you don't know anything.

881
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,310
Lord help me if they ask me if I do.

882
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,360
I'm not a good liar.

883
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,110
Except to Brewster.

884
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,370
It takes a lotta lies to keep a marriage goin'.

885
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:18,220
All personel. Prepare to present your identity and clearance cards.

886
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,970
Lord. What in the...

887
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,130
You've got us in a lot of troubles.

888
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:32,110
My opinion, we're looking at a highly trained group, sir.

889
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,070
I'm thinking, conceivably, sir...

890
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,570
Special forces or so on so forth.

891
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,320
Red army special forces?

892
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,370
Conceivably. I-I mean, they're highly-trained.

893
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,670
Well-financed. An elite group.

894
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,890
Highly efficient. Ruthless. Clockwork precision.

895
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,810
Infiltration took less than five minutes, sir.

896
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,840
My conservative estimate is that this was a strike force

897
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,440
of at least ten men.

898
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,580
Have you always been alone?

899
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,100
Did you ever have someone?

900
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,920
Do you know what happened to you? Do you?

901
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,110
Because I don't. I don't know what happened to me.

902
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,500
I-I don't know.

903
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,010
I look in the mirror and the only thing that I recognize.

904
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,510
Are these eyes.

905
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,440
In this old man's face.

906
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:37,960
You know, sometimes I think

907
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,850
I was either born too early or too late for my life.

908
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,580
Maybe we're both just relics.

909
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,950
Security measures have been increased to maximum levels.

910
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:53,070
Prepare to present your identity and clearance cards.

911
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,990
Sir. Got them.

912
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,550
Oh, zelda, elisa.

913
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,710
Looks like you two punched out before the incident.

914
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,990
Still...

915
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:20,620
If you know something about what transpired here...

916
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:23,720
It's your obligation... to report.

917
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,740
Any detail no matter how small or trivial it may seem.

918
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,520
Trivial means unimportant.

919
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:33,400
I didn't see nothin' out of the ordinary, no.

920
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,930
Or trivial.

921
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,730
See, my feet were hurtin'.

922
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,910
What about you?

923
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,080
She didn't see anything.

924
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,280
Hoffstetler. Dr. hoffstetler...

925
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,960
Did either of you see him coming in or out of the lab?

926
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,060
He works there... doesn't he?

927
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:02,990
I mean in a different way. Doing something different.

928
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,220
Something trivial?

929
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,440
No, sir.

930
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,360
What am I doing?

931
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,620
Interviewing the fucking help.

932
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,190
The shit cleaners.

933
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,610
The piss wipers.

934
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,050
You two, go ahead. Leave.

935
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,770
What'd you say to me?

936
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,740
What is she saying?

937
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,410
I... i didn't catch it.

938
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,250
What is she saying?!

939
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,650
She-she is saying "thank you."

940
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,110
Next.

941
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:35,720
I didn't see you last night.

942
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,700
Or the night before.

943
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,460
I'm sorry, ed, but now that I'm

944
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,960
spending all day on the office

945
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:43,670
Carol feels that I should spend my evenings with her.

946
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,970
Well, if you spend the evenings with her,

947
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,640
When will I see you?

948
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:58,160
There's only one thing left to do.

949
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,390
Volunteer.

950
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,940
No, no, no, no, no!

951
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,420
I want to get home early.

952
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:00,160
Brewster's been in a bad mood lately.

953
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,570
Holy Jesus!

954
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:05,970
What are you doing standing in the shadows.

955
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,980
Of the women's locker room?

956
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,120
They may be watching me and there are no cameras here.

957
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,180
For good reason.

958
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,090
What if you caught us at an inconvenient moment?

959
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,830
I need to know that he's all right.

960
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,240
- He is. - When will you release him?

961
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,350
Soon.

962
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,800
When the rains fills the canal that flows to the sea.

963
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,460
If you need anything.

964
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,720
Release him soon.

965
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,540
What did she say?

966
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:35,080
She said, you are a good man, Dr. Hoffstetler.

967
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,200
My name is dimitri.

968
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,080
Honored to meet you.

969
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,820
Hey, dummy, phone call for you. It's urgent.

970
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,190
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

971
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,070
Believe me, I'm fine.

972
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,030
He ate pandora. Wasn't his fault.

973
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,280
He's a wild creature.

974
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,980
We can't ask him to be anything else.

975
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,730
Elisa, go find him.

976
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,470
Go. Go!

977
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,210
Go.

978
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,140
You're lucky.

979
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,240
I stayed awake as long as I could.

980
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,120
But, you know, I'm not even young man anymore.

981
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,300
Is he all right? You sure?

982
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,290
Where you going?

983
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,770
No, no.

984
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:36,520
Okay, don't-no, no. Don't play with the kitties. No, no.

985
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:37,960
Don't play with the kitties.

986
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,560
I'm not-i'm not angry. I'm not...

987
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:56,360
You did that, but it's okay. Ooh,

988
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,670
I don't think that's sanitary.

989
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
Enough.

990
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,110
Interesting guy.

991
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:22,460
Prepare to present your identity and clearance cards.

992
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,010
You wanted to see me?

993
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,210
How's it going? The investigation?

994
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,780
Well, we have a promising lead.

995
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,690
Really?

996
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,020
That's good to hear.

997
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,350
You joined us in galveston, but.

998
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,840
Where were you before, hoffstetler?

999
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,790
Doctor.

1000
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,610
- Excuse me? - Doctor hoffstetler.

1001
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,200
Protocol.

1002
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,890
Wisconsin. Madison.

1003
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,540
Oh, that's right. You gave up a

1004
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,290
tenure track position, didn't you?

1005
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,160
Gave it all up... for us.

1006
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,990
I suppose...

1007
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,920
you are getting ready to leave us now, then, huh?

1008
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,790
Only it the creature isn't found.

1009
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,480
Well, what do you think? You think we will find it?

1010
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,880
Well, you said you had a lead.

1011
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,240
I do.

1012
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,240
Why you smiling, hon?

1013
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,640
Stop looking like that.

1014
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,390
What happened?

1015
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,540
Why?

1016
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,160
How?

1017
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,260
How?

1018
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,880
Does he... have a...?

1019
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,720
Lord!

1020
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,430
Never trust a man.

1021
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,170
Even when he looks flat down there.

1022
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,520
You rang?

1023
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,640
Oh, hi, peter, I just signed up for anthropology.

1024
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,050
We're gonna hold class in the

1025
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:09,470
amazon jungle in South America.

1026
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,040
South america? Ooh, man.

1027
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,470
You're gonna have to get up awful early in the morning.

1028
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:13,530
That's a long hike.

1029
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,380
No, peter, we're gonna stay down there.

1030
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,340
We are?

1031
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,010
Oh, no, you're not coming along too.

1032
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:21,670
This is a gelatin parfait.

1033
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,530
You're gonna love it.

1034
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,370
Dad, can we watch bonanza?

1035
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,260
Bonanza is much too violent.

1036
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,690
Do you know what I was thinking today?

1037
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,440
We get the kids a p-u-p-p-y.

1038
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,830
What is going on?!

1039
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:24,250
I've got water pouring into my theater!

1040
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,410
I have four paying customers, I can't afford a refund.

1041
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,130
It's probably a pipe. I'll take care of it.

1042
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,340
You don't fix it, no more rent room.

1043
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,440
I will fix it.

1044
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,800
Elisa!

1045
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,400
Dear god.

1046
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,720
Elisa!

1047
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,240
I'm toweling my hair!

1048
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,500
It's my hair.

1049
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,190
Oh, look at my arm.

1050
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,270
The wound! It's like it was never there. Look at that.

1051
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,670
You said that...

1052
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,360
He was worshipped like a god.

1053
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:40,860
Now, is he a god? I don't know if he's a god.

1054
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:43,830
I mean, he ate a cat, so I don't know, I don't know. But...

1055
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,550
I mean, we have to keep him around a while.

1056
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:48,650
A little while.

1057
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:09,370
Hello?

1058
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,780
Your water, sir.

1059
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,290
And sir, general hoyt...

1060
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,400
Tell him I'm not here. Tell him I'll call him back.

1061
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,360
Don't put him through.

1062
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:00,780
No, sir!

1063
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,620
H-he's in your office.

1064
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:08,640
At this point, our only concern is the asset.

1065
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:11,760
- Do you have it? - Still in the wind, sir.

1066
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,080
Well, that won't do.

1067
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:16,440
Yes, sir. I know.

1068
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,540
You've known me how long, sir?

1069
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,300
Thirteen years.

1070
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,770
- Battle of pusan. - Yes, sir.

1071
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:28,000
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient all his life.

1072
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:34,470
All of it... and he is... useful. And he expects...

1073
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,580
He has certain expectations in return.

1074
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,470
And then he fails, once.

1075
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,090
Only once. What does that make him?

1076
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,120
Does that make him a failure?

1077
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:54,800
When is a man done, sir? Proving himself?

1078
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,840
A good man.

1079
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:59,460
A decent man.

1080
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,250
Decent?

1081
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:12,710
A man has the decency not to fuck up.

1082
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,430
Now, that's one thing. That's real decent of him.

1083
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,320
But the other kind of decency...

1084
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,290
It doesn't really matter.

1085
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,420
We sell it, but it's an export.

1086
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:26,770
We sell it because we don't use it.

1087
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,730
Thirty six hours from now, this entire episode will be over.

1088
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,810
And so will you.

1089
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,600
Our universe will have a hole in it with your outline.

1090
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:48,040
An you will have moved on to an alternate universe.

1091
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,300
A universe of shit.

1092
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,880
You will be lost to civilization.

1093
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,920
And you will be unborn.

1094
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,640
Unmade.

1095
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,030
And undone.

1096
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,670
So, go get some real decency, son.

1097
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,560
And unfuck this mess.

1098
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:56,480
Thirty-six hours.

1099
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,640
Thirty-six hours. Well, shit, deliver.

1100
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,920
That's what you do. You deliver, right?

1101
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,460
Right?!

1102
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:08,900
You'll.

1103
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:21,200
Never know.

1104
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,480
Just how much

1105
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,120
I've.

1106
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:30,830
Loved

1107
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,560
elisa.

1108
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,290
What is it, honey?

1109
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:52,730
This isn't good.

1110
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:57,400
I'm gonna call dr. Hoffstetler.

1111
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,740
We gotta release him tonight, honey.

1112
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,580
I'll come back and help you.

1113
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:29,560
He's coming out.

1114
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,140
Ah, fuck.

1115
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,970
Sir, if you don't mind me saying, you...

1116
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,680
You don't look so well.

1117
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,470
Shut up.

1118
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,490
Can you smell that? I mean...

1119
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:54,290
I think it's your fingers, they're they're...

1120
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:55,730
black.

1121
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:02,260
There he is.

1122
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:04,520
Doctor fucking shit-bird.

1123
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,650
Oh, there's no call for cursing, sir.

1124
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,010
Get out of the car, I'm taking it.

1125
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:16,690
- This is my car. - Get the fuck out.

1126
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,380
Out of my car?

1127
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,610
Did I stutter?

1128
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:55,130
Strickland! Thank god!

1129
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,000
You were speaking russian.

1130
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:59,020
Bob.

1131
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,220
- What's your name? - Hoffstetler.

1132
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:16,080
No, no. Don't lie. You don't need to.

1133
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,770
You took a bullet to the gut.

1134
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,250
You're dead.

1135
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:22,110
I need the names, ranks, and

1136
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:24,170
location of the entire.

1137
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,230
Strike team?

1138
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,580
The ones who took the asset!

1139
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:41,090
This candy. It's cheap candy. B-but I love it.

1140
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:43,040
Ever since I was a kid.

1141
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:46,740
Now some folks favor more sophisticated snacks.

1142
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:50,590
Nougat center and all that fu-fu shit.

1143
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:52,470
But not me, bob.

1144
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:54,960
This is it for me.

1145
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,850
Now, sometimes if I'm feeling anxious...

1146
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:01,470
I bite right into it.

1147
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,310
But mostly...

1148
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,350
I take my time.

1149
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:07,270
I make it last.

1150
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:16,210
Names, ranks, and location of the strike team.

1151
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,160
Names! Ranks! Now!

1152
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,250
No names.

1153
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,060
No ranks.

1154
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,150
They...

1155
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,780
They just clean.

1156
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,100
All right, brewster, I'm gonna fix you dinner,

1157
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,590
And then I'm gonna run out for a

1158
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:52,010
little while and help a friend.

1159
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,830
- Help with what? - Help a friend.

1160
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,490
Zelda.

1161
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:01,360
Door.

1162
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:07,600
Well, you could help me and answer the door, brewster.

1163
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,150
You're sittin' right here just ten feet away from it!

1164
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,760
My back's achin' me, woman. Now move!

1165
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:14,060
Your back. Your back. Always your back.

1166
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,380
Mr. strickland?

1167
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:20,540
What are you doing here?

1168
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:23,500
- Who's that man, zelda? - Where is he?

1169
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,180
- What are you talking about? - Where'd you take him?

1170
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,460
- Zelda. - What are you talking about?

1171
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,510
I-I don't...

1172
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,710
The thing...

1173
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,930
In the lab.

1174
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:34,860
Where is it?

1175
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:36,900
- Listen, fella... - sit down!

1176
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,690
I'm sorry, sir, if-if-

1177
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:50,060
I knew anything, I would surely tell you.

1178
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,280
That story about samson.

1179
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,540
I never told you how it ends.

1180
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:02,590
After the philistines torture him...

1181
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,370
And blind him...

1182
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:08,920
Samson asks god for the strength he needs.

1183
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,950
And at the last minute, he's spared.

1184
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:17,620
And the lord gives him his strength back.

1185
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,940
One last time.

1186
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:25,090
And he holds...

1187
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:30,770
The columns of the temple with his powerful arms.

1188
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:33,820
And he crushes them.

1189
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:48,650
And he brings the whole building down on the philistines.

1190
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:55,710
He dies.

1191
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:00,200
But he gets every single one of those motherfuckers.

1192
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:02,390
That is his will!

1193
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:10,990
Now, do you know what that particular story means?

1194
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,440
For us, delilah?

1195
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:16,710
It means if you know something you're not telling me,

1196
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:18,220
You're gonna tell me.

1197
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:21,000
Either before...

1198
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,610
Or after...

1199
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:25,480
I bring this particular temple...

1200
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:29,640
Down upon our heads.

1201
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,410
Gal stole that thing right out the lab.

1202
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,730
Whatever it is.

1203
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,460
Mute girl took it.

1204
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:39,350
I heard my wife talkin' on the phone about it.

1205
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:47,820
Thank you very much, mr. Fuller for your assistance.

1206
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:00,460
What have you done?

1207
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:03,110
- Zelda. - I gotta warn her.

1208
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,230
He's going after her.

1209
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:06,340
You will do no such thing, woman.

1210
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:08,060
Why you worryin' about her?

1211
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:09,590
She broke the law.

1212
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,680
Shut up, brewster.

1213
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,080
You shut up!

1214
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,090
For years, you don't talk.

1215
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:17,290
Now you can't shut your mouth.

1216
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,940
Damn you, brewster.

1217
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:23,500
You wouldn't understand.

1218
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,530
Couldn't understand. Not if you tried your whole life.

1219
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,710
- Hello? - Giles, is that you?

1220
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,630
- Yes. - Okay, put elisa on the phone.

1221
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:34,320
Zelda.

1222
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,130
Elisa, honey...

1223
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,210
Make a sound in the phone if you can hear.

1224
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:41,520
Okay, good.

1225
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:43,290
He's comin' for you.

1226
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:45,440
You gotta go now and you gotta take that thing with you.

1227
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,280
What? Elisa?!

1228
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:29,540
Dammit.

1229
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,610
We have to go.

1230
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,290
Where are you?

1231
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:48,800
Where the fuck are you?!

1232
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,870
I do not fail.

1233
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:17,030
I deliver.

1234
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:23,160
Elisa!

1235
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:25,700
Elisa.

1236
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:35,910
No!

1237
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:25,260
Fuck.

1238
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,270
You are a god.

1239
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:36,750
If I told you about her...

1240
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:38,390
What would I say?

1241
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,320
That they lived happily ever after?

1242
01:57:42,110 --> 01:57:43,580
I believe they did.

1243
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,280
That they were in love?

1244
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,230
That they remained in love?

1245
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:50,160
I'm sure that's true.

1246
01:57:51,370 --> 01:57:53,360
But when I think of her...

1247
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,450
Of elisa...

1248
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:59,520
The only thing that comes to mind is a poem...

1249
01:57:59,710 --> 01:58:01,700
Whispered by someone in love...

1250
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:03,850
Hundreds of years ago...

1251
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,310
Unable to perceive the shape of You...

1252
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:10,540
"I find you all around me.

1253
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,290
"Your presence fills my eyes

1254
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:14,860
"with your love...

1255
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,340
"it humbles my heart...

1256
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:19,640
For you are everywhere."

1257
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,170
要是我同你说起

1258
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,350
如果我

1259
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,960
我该告诉你些什么呢

1260
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,740
我想

1261
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,280
我是否该告诉你那段

1262
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,220
发生在很久以前

1263
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,180
在正义统治的最后那段时日里

1264
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,110
或者和你说说这个地方

1265
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,590
一个海边的小城市

1266
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,150
远离尘嚣

1267
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,050
或者　我不知道

1268
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,880
我会和你说说她吗

1269
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,590
那个哑巴公主

1270
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,440
或者我只需要告知你

1271
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
事实的真相

1272
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,850
关于爱与失落的故事

1273
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,740
以及那

1274
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,220
想要摧毁这一切的怪物

1275
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,090
我有罪

1276
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,030
我冒犯了上帝

1277
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,700
我罪孽深重　黑德克大人

1278
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,440
说来听听

1279
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,600
我对祭祀仪式有所怀疑

1280
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,310
我不想爬楼梯

1281
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,140
劳埃德小姐　如果要睡觉

1282
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,990
就得上楼去啊

1283
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,300
被警报声吵醒了吗

1284
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,330
那是巧克力工厂失火了

1285
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,500
你能闻到吗

1286
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,870
噢　烧焦的可可味儿

1287
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,380
人生　祸福难测

1288
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,720
噢　我亲爱的孩子

1289
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,080
如果不是你照顾我　我估计会日益消瘦

1290
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,140
我这个远近闻名的饿汉

1291
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,990
看看这个

1292
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,730
在楼梯上跳的　是踢踏舞

1293
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,840
那个真难

1294
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,130
卡格尼跳过　不一样但是很美

1295
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,070
我也要这样跳

1296
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,780
好啊

1297
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,340
- 准备好了吗　- 好了

1298
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,270
来咯

1299
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,340
啊

1300
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,330
看　你学得真快

1301
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,740
埃莉莎

1302
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,490
下次你来交房租的时候

1303
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,610
留下来看圣经电影吧　好吗

1304
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,670
我这里有两张免费的票

1305
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,120
你可以带你的邻居贾尔斯来　他是个好人

1306
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,190
圣经电影和喜剧　没人会来影院看　对吧

1307
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,320
那　我额外赠送爆米花和苏打水

1308
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,100
噢　不　布尔加斯　那里是两个S

1309
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,180
能不能行

1310
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,530
狂欢节　有两个S　两个S

1311
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,430
全体人员　请注意

1312
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,060
12区已调整至a-c级别

1313
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,350
埃莉莎

1314
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,000
快点　都到我了

1315
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,510
你以后得准时到

1316
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,060
嘿　你干嘛呢

1317
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,550
- 不要插队　哑巴　- 别瞎说话

1318
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,660
我帮她占了位置

1319
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,150
要是我被通报了　我一定会来找你和那个哑巴的

1320
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,870
那你就来吧　尤兰达

1321
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
那你来吧

1322
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,360
啊

1323
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,540
我的脚要痛死了

1324
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,990
出门前　我给布鲁斯特做了香肠薄饼

1325
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
天呐　他全吃光了

1326
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,030
没说谢谢　也没说好吃　连看都没看我

1327
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,810
男人沉默起来就像一座坟墓

1328
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,910
但如果他说点奉承话

1329
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,540
那他堪比莎士比亚

1330
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,120
然后我就屁颠颠的回去给他做早餐

1331
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,540
鸡蛋　熏肉　黄油面包

1332
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,580
我连面包上的黄油都给那个男人涂好了

1333
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,610
两面都涂了　把他当亲儿子养

1334
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,310
但他连句谢谢都没有

1335
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,920
你肯定会心怀感激

1336
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,870
因为你是一个受过教育的人

1337
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,770
但是我的布鲁斯特　我为他所做的一切

1338
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,020
仅仅是异性相吸

1339
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,530
都好长时间没有工作了

1340
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,300
搞什么鬼

1341
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,480
卢

1342
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,530
你们能不能把垃圾丢进垃圾桶里

1343
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,030
垃圾桶用来干嘛的

1344
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,580
有意思　用来当摆设的

1345
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,560
好了　对不起　泽尔达

1346
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,190
我不知道他们在做什么

1347
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,960
这帮天杀的就是瞎忙活

1348
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,940
泽尔达

1349
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,200
- 别唠叨个不停　- 是　先生

1350
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,460
而且　不准在此亵渎神灵

1351
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,170
对不起　弗莱明先生

1352
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,190
宣布一个事情

1353
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,050
今天　我们t-4将迎来一支新团队和研究对象

1354
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,160
这是来自我们的兄弟实验室的

1355
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,800
罗伯特　霍夫斯特勒博士

1356
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,880
我不想强调

1357
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,700
或者夸大说辞

1358
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,960
但这可能是目前为止

1359
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,430
这座实验室里最敏感的研究了

1360
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,800
- 旅途愉快吗　- 还行

1361
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,590
- 这里的安保是谁　-请稍等

1362
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,060
安保　谁是安保

1363
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,780
先生　欢迎来到t-4

1364
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,010
我是弗莱明　安保主管

1365
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
有任何问题您都可以找我

1366
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,910
从现在开始　由我接管这里

1367
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,740
让他们都出去

1368
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,160
帮我把舱体移到压缩机上

1369
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,920
这里　这里

1370
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,690
把它放在这里

1371
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,570
我们需要立即给它加压

1372
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,500
埃莉莎　埃莉莎

1373
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,960
快来

1374
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,310
上帝　这个地方到底在干什么啊

1375
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,960
你刚刚看到了吗

1376
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,160
是的　我戴了假发　怎么样

1377
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
噢　小心　有车

1378
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,740
这是遮秃假发　法语词汇

1379
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,850
这可是永久的

1380
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,140
坦塔罗斯逃脱不了死亡的命运

1381
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,810
因为树枝上的果实

1382
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,670
他总也触及不到

1383
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,110
溪流的水位

1384
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,500
只要他弯腰就会下降

1385
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,830
现在用于比喻那些可望不可即的

1386
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,510
比如那些诱人的馅饼

1387
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,410
谢谢　一定要再次馆谷歌

1388
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,450
是的　早餐吃馅饼　相信我

1389
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,980
嘿　伙计　欢迎来到迪克西餐馆

1390
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,570
我以前在这见过你　对吗

1391
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,380
是的　事实上我是这里的常客了

1392
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,000
来点酸橙派吗

1393
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,790
是的　是的　两个打包

1394
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,600
你别管　拜托了

1395
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
呃　这味道真是好极了

1396
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,070
这可能不利于健康　但我钟意的事都是这样

1397
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,860
不　不　这是一个非常好的派　关键是酸橙

1398
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,230
你不会就是

1399
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,840
那个著名的迪克西　道格本人吧

1400
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,410
不　馅饼由卡车运输到全国各地

1401
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,310
他们称之为连锁经营

1402
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,060
噢

1403
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,830
他们给我们配卡车司机　招牌

1404
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,830
那个馅饼男孩　是我们的吉祥物

1405
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,950
我可不那样说话　我是渥太华来的

1406
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,330
不会吧

1407
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,290
我买了

1408
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
美味的馅饼(美味的小尤物)

1409
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,960
那个

1410
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,320
呃　那个小男孩　他是意大利人吗

1411
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,960
估计是的

1412
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,640
太机智了

1413
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,980
一定要再次光顾

1414
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,080
要再次光顾

1415
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,490
你觉得他是那个意思吗

1416
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,920
他在暗示我　你　你听到了

1417
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,190
这馅饼太脏了

1418
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,670
不要吐出来

1419
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,360
下次　我们试试别的口味

1420
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,630
嗯

1421
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,950
那我们等下再吃

1422
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,190
现在是东部时间上午6点

1423
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,760
天空渐亮

1424
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,180
一股凉爽的北风穿过

1425
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,620
成群的黑人

1426
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,340
聚集在

1427
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,840
噢　赶紧换台

1428
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,510
我不想看到那个

1429
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,500
不想看也不想听

1430
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,370
这个好　这个好

1431
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,290
噢　看贝蒂

1432
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
如此年轻貌美

1433
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,420
如果回到过去

1434
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,090
回到我18岁的时候

1435
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,530
那个时候的我一无所知

1436
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
如果给自己一点建议

1437
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,250
我会说

1438
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,280
珍爱牙齿　大胆做爱

1439
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,630
还有很多

1440
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,510
噢不　不　这是个很好的建议

1441
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,660
你看下这个

1442
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,660
你看

1443
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,790
这个国家最优秀的一群人

1444
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,010
上个厕所　尿到到处都是

1445
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,120
唔　唔　唔

1446
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,650
天花板上都有小便的斑点

1447
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,500
你说他们是怎么尿的

1448
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,840
他们要多大的便池才够啊

1449
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,900
他们肯定私底下在练习

1450
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,460
我们布鲁斯特

1451
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,940
没人说他很优秀

1452
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,060
但是

1453
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,740
他也能有个70%的时候尿准便池

1454
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,870
- 不好意思　先生　-不　不　没事的

1455
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,400
继续吧

1456
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,350
你们两个聊得很开心啊

1457
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,580
肯定是在聊悄悄话

1458
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,790
不用理我

1459
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,230
埃莉莎

1460
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,820
别碰那个

1461
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,720
那个可爱的小东西是来自阿拉巴马的问候

1462
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,980
模制手柄设计

1463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,050
低电流的高压电棍

1464
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,490
我是斯特里克兰　负责安保

1465
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,270
弗莱明就是安保

1466
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,660
哈

1467
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,140
不　不　男人需要洗手

1468
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,340
获得满足前或者在那之后

1469
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,340
通过这件事可以分析一个男人

1470
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,480
要是他前后都洗手

1471
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,340
说明他性格软弱

1472
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,290
女士们

1473
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,270
和你们聊天十分愉快

1474
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,630
长得矮的人都很卑鄙

1475
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,750
我从来没有遇到过

1476
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,400
各方面都很好的矮子

1477
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,070
不　先生

1478
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,380
他们都是耍阴招的卑鄙小人

1479
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,120
估计是下面空气的原因

1480
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,950
缺少氧气什么的

1481
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
嗯

1482
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,270
救命　他流血了

1483
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,210
来人啊

1484
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,510
快走　快走

1485
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,170
你觉得是苏联人闯进来了

1486
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,840
我不觉得　如果是苏联人

1487
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,270
杜安的肉饼都不会放过他们

1488
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,190
有两枪　你听到了吗

1489
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,410
好吧　三枪

1490
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,570
还有尖叫声

1491
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,210
上帝　这个地方发生了什么

1492
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,320
你们两个　跟我来

1493
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,620
现在吗　弗莱明先生

1494
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,850
能不能让我们先吃饭

1495
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,710
马上

1496
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,880
哦　老天爷　真是摊上麻烦了

1497
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,940
摊上大麻烦了

1498
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,600
给你们20分钟的时间

1499
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,470
把这里打扫干净

1500
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,170
大概就这些　20分钟

1501
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,400
这么多血　这里到底怎么了

1502
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,190
尿我都能搞定

1503
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,730
屎也不在话下

1504
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,430
但是血　额

1505
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,550
我和血八字不合

1506
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,980
这里　亲爱的　帮我把它擦干

1507
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,880
我们赶快把这里搞定吧

1508
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,430
那是薯条吗

1509
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,440
噢

1510
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,120
是手指啊

1511
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,430
我知道了　是两根手指

1512
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,500
行了行了　赶紧拿开　你在这里等着

1513
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,990
我去喊弗莱明先生

1514
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,330
那些手指在哪

1515
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,660
手指呢

1516
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,360
不　我相信你　亲爱的　你确定它还活着吗

1517
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,160
因为我曾经在嘉年华帐篷里看到过美人鱼

1518
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,620
其实那就是只猴子

1519
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,470
缝了条鱼尾巴　真骗到我了

1520
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,670
好了　我道歉

1521
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,460
我快要交稿了

1522
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
你知道吗

1523
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,870
玉米片是用于防止自慰的

1524
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,220
但并不奏效

1525
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,910
噢　艾丽丝　费伊开始了

1526
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,760
她是个超级巨星　超级

1527
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,230
有一天　她受够了

1528
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,790
娱乐圈的那些屁事和潜规则

1529
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,430
就潇洒地离开了那个圈子

1530
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,070
铛铛

1531
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,420
当个垃圾看看

1532
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,980
也还不错　是吧

1533
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,570
你吃完饭就去睡觉　休息下

1534
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,550
等我拿到报酬

1535
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,630
我们就去买馅饼

1536
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,200
不　不给你买　我自己吃

1537
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,970
你就吃你喜欢的

1538
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,300
祝我好运

1539
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,170
绿色

1540
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,210
他们想让果冻画成绿色

1541
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,670
- 之前跟我说的是红色啊　- 新想法

1542
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,850
大势所趋　用绿色吧

1543
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,250
他们还想让这一家子　看起来更高兴

1544
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,180
- 更快乐　- 嗯

1545
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,130
这位父亲看起来像

1546
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,210
解锁了传教士体位那样高兴

1547
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,300
贾尔斯

1548
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,210
他们想要哪种高兴呢

1549
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,940
客户本想要的是照片　我说服了他们

1550
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,280
很遗憾　这是一幅好作品

1551
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,110
没错　我觉得这是我最好的作品之一

1552
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,340
你现在靠什么度日

1553
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,680
- 你喝酒吗　- 不

1554
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,060
滴酒不沾　真的

1555
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,340
那你离开克莱恩　桑德斯公司之后　找到工作了吗

1556
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,260
你说我被你们辞退后

1557
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,640
我们先不谈这个

1558
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,680
我想回来　伯尼

1559
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,400
再说吧

1560
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,160
先做好手头的工作

1561
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,470
干得漂亮

1562
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,680
埃莉莎

1563
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,320
你在这儿做什么

1564
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,030
哦　打扫是吧

1565
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,410
听着　宝贝

1566
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,610
"扶腰撒尿"先生要见我们

1567
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,800
泽尔达　D　富勒

1568
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,110
泽尔达　你们认识多久了

1569
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,100
大概十年了　先生

1570
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,830
你没有兄弟姐妹吗

1571
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,180
没有　先生

1572
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,660
对于你们这种人来说倒是不常见啊

1573
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,640
我妈妈生下我后

1574
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,470
就死了

1575
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,700
那D代表什么

1576
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,880
达丽拉　先生

1577
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,770
在圣经上找到的名字

1578
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,000
达丽拉　她背叛了参孙

1579
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,460
骗他入睡　借机剃光了他的头发

1580
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,100
腓力斯人对他百般折辱

1581
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,710
剜去他的双眼

1582
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,170
我想我妈妈没能深刻理解这本好书

1583
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,650
而你

1584
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,700
埃莉莎　埃斯波西托

1585
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,780
埃斯波西托不是孤儿院的意思吗

1586
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,270
噢　来自帕特南的悲惨孤儿院啊

1587
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,090
他们在河边　确切说在水里找到了她

1588
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,240
是你找到了我的手指

1589
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,570
噢

1590
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,090
谢谢

1591
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,240
在手术室里待了三个小时

1592
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,340
他们重塑了我的第一根指骨

1593
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,960
缝合了我的肌腱

1594
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,790
不知道能不能好起来

1595
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,330
还有点芥末沾在上面

1596
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,350
- 一个纸袋子　- 当时我们只有那个来装

1597
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,030
她不能说话　所以我来回答

1598
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,560
她不能　她是聋子吗

1599
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,670
是哑巴　先生

1600
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,850
她说她可以听见

1601
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,460
噢　你脖子上的伤疤

1602
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,530
就是它们损害了你的声带　对吧

1603
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,500
她说从她小时候就有了

1604
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,250
谁会那样对一个孩子

1605
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,690
这个世界真是罪恶

1606
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,730
对吧　达丽拉

1607
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,070
好了　来说说之前的事儿

1608
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,120
你打扫了实验室然后出去了

1609
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,100
关在里面的那个东西　是个耻辱

1610
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,180
泽尔达　你知道什么是耻辱吗

1611
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,150
比较讨厌的东西

1612
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,320
没错　我把那个

1613
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,300
肮脏的东西

1614
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,770
从南美的淤泥里一路拖到这里

1615
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,910
一路上相处得并不好

1616
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,900
现在　你可能会认为

1617
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,830
那个东西像个人

1618
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,430
都是用两条腿走路是吗

1619
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
但是　我们是凭上帝的模样创造出来的

1620
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,880
你们难道认为那东西是上帝的样子吗

1621
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,870
先生　我不知道上帝长什么样

1622
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,870
泽尔达　他像一个人类　比如我这样的

1623
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,860
或者你这样

1624
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,410
我想可能会更像我一点

1625
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,580
好了　先这样吧

1626
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,000
霍伊特将军　谢谢你的回电

1627
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,440
- 好些了吗　-是的　长官　好多了

1628
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,020
- 吃了止痛药　- 你没了两根手指吗

1629
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,220
是的　两根　他咬断了我两根手指

1630
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,020
但是我的拇指　食指和中指都还在

1631
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,930
你能这样说　肯定就会没事的

1632
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,650
当然　将军　恭候您的到来

1633
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,210
那东西还得您来做决定

1634
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,340
果味馅饼期待您的光顾

1635
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,480
巴尔的摩市中心新开了三家店

1636
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,900
前途光明

1637
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,410
休息一下吧

1638
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,410
九点半来接我

1639
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,380
九点半　好的长官

1640
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,290
迪克西　道格斯　美味的馅饼

1641
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,070
我回来了

1642
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,230
给你做了一个煎蛋卷

1643
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,340
-嘿　爸爸　我告诉你-没有薄煎饼吗

1644
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,440
我找了很多个箱子

1645
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,380
但没找到平底锅

1646
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,090
我告诉你

1647
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,120
所以给你做的是奶酪和花菜蛋卷

1648
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,250
你现在怎么样　疼吗

1649
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,610
-有点　吃了药好多了-我告诉你

1650
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,300
- 什么　- 我们在新学校那儿

1651
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,350
埋了一个时间囊　我想问问你

1652
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,520
我们以后会不会都有

1653
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,070
- 飞行背囊　- 会有的

1654
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,630
噢　公交车来了

1655
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,340
这可是美国

1656
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,230
- 爸爸再见　- 爸爸再见

1657
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,650
吃完煎蛋卷后　好好洗手

1658
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,260
洗完上楼来　亲爱的

1659
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,510
我有点喜欢这儿了　孩子们特别钟意这个草坪

1660
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,870
并且　从这儿到华盛顿只有半小时的路程

1661
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,870
但这里还是巴尔的摩　伊莱恩　这地方不招人待见

1662
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,430
你知道我在想什么吗

1663
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,010
我在想　我需要一辆新车

1664
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,010
你需要一辆新车　是吗

1665
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,400
一辆凯迪拉克怎么样　长官

1666
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,620
理查德

1667
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,970
噢

1668
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,470
噢

1669
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,820
噢　理查德

1670
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,870
噢

1671
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,050
喔　噢

1672
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,070
噢

1673
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,380
宝　宝贝

1674
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,490
宝贝　你

1675
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,570
你　你的手在流血

1676
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,840
别说话

1677
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,700
别说话

1678
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,440
安静　安静

1679
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,540
啊　嗯　别说话

1680
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,160
航空学博士莱文森　航空学博士莱文森

1681
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,510
- 在窗户上　- 什么

1682
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,340
雀

1683
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,000
仍在窗上筑巢

1684
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,970
- 而鹰叼走自己的猎物　- 什么

1685
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,590
埃莉莎　快点

1686
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,580
快点　姑娘

1687
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,910
泽尔达你又这样

1688
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,880
一边儿待着去

1689
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
噢

1690
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,100
哟

1691
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,700
嘿　泽尔达　来一根不

1692
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,400
- 吸烟有害健康　杜安

1693
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,060
- 没错　但我挺健康的

1694
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,490
确实有害健康

1695
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,060
来吧　埃莉莎　就一根

1696
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,720
来来来

1697
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,800
不用担心那个摄像头　我们休息时就把它抬上去

1698
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,630
- 额　- 这是一个盲区

1699
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,450
弗莱明　我得在这儿做点事

1700
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,100
可以帮我拿一下麦当劳吗

1701
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,510
你想我了哈

1702
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,730
我带了一个小点心

1703
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,380
你害怕这个　是吧

1704
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,380
吉　从此刻起你要习惯它

1705
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,120
你又来了　发出那种讨厌的噪音

1706
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,660
是你在哭吗　啊　是不是

1707
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,070
你受伤了

1708
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,170
还是说

1709
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,800
你生气了

1710
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,720
或者你想再咬我一口　来啊

1711
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,780
哈啊

1712
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,540
你真敢啊

1713
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,880
我说　你在求我吗

1714
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,480
那见鬼的声音

1715
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,380
是我听过最烦心的噪音

1716
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,900
转接沃尔特斯上校

1717
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,900
沃尔特斯上校　内线电话

1718
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,480
埃莉莎

1719
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,660
埃莉莎

1720
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,540
- 霍伊特将军　欢迎您的到来

1721
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,580
万事俱备　你能来真是太好了

1722
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,410
- 见到你很开心　孩子　- 非常荣幸

1723
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,970
上帝保佑啊

1724
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,690
比我想得大得多啊

1725
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,230
丑陋无比

1726
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,960
你知道吗　亚马逊的野蛮人

1727
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,870
把他当神供着

1728
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,390
现在倒不像一个神了

1729
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,310
长官　他们都是些野蛮人

1730
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,340
他们会扔一些贡品进去

1731
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,260
像花啊水果啊之类的垃圾

1732
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,370
他们还试图用弓箭阻止我们钻油井

1733
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,860
真是异想天开

1734
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,730
他在流血

1735
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,010
发生了什么

1736
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,000
它就是个畜生　霍夫斯德勒　只管驯服它就行

1737
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,770
小伙子　我们抓到了怎样一个怪物啊

1738
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,700
长官　这个生物

1739
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,600
他可以轮流使用两个完全独立

1740
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,100
的呼吸系统

1741
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,100
- 泥鳅也可以做到啊　- 不不不

1742
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,510
听着　如果你想把人送入太空

1743
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,480
他必须要忍受

1744
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,300
普通人体所不能忍受的各种环境

1745
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,660
这能增加我们与苏联竞争的胜算

1746
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,450
它离了水还能呼吸多久

1747
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,940
长官　事实是我们

1748
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,490
不太了解这个东西

1749
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,590
我们都知道　苏联人很想要它

1750
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,340
那些杂种们

1751
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,090
我们任其送了一条狗进太空

1752
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,450
然后我们嘲笑他们

1753
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,790
接下来发生的事情你们也知道　他们送人进了太空

1754
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,690
卫星绕着我们的星球转　天知道他们在搞什么鬼

1755
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,510
接下来轮到谁笑了　赫鲁晓夫

1756
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,650
我们任其送狗进太空

1757
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,900
他笑着又送了一个小子进太空

1758
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,630
他又笑着在古巴投了导弹

1759
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,570
我们学到了什么

1760
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,620
长官　我们得把他放到水里

1761
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,740
看这些科学家倒像是艺术家了

1762
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,840
他们爱上了自己的玩物

1763
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,200
看这里　在中间

1764
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,830
这家伙有一个厚实的关节软骨

1765
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,110
将主肺和次肺分开了

1766
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,760
鲍勃　我说得对吗

1767
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,140
是这样　但是我们

1768
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,030
能够决定

1769
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,170
它让X光

1770
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,630
理论上是的　但是

1771
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,950
- 我们有很多方法　- 我相信如果我们想

1772
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,720
打败苏联　就得解剖这个东西

1773
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,560
不　不

1774
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,140
- 把他大卸八块　然后深入研究　- 不

1775
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,400
不　这违背了我们的初衷

1776
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,340
长官　求您了　他昏过去了

1777
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,650
把他放进罐子里加压

1778
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,840
霍伊特将军

1779
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,190
不论怎样您都不能杀他

1780
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,840
小伙子　数数这些星

1781
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,590
整整五颗星

1782
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,810
意味着我有权任意处置这怪物

1783
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,260
如果你想汇报研究成果　我会听下去

1784
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,970
但是到最后

1785
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,140
由我做决定

1786
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,120
把那个东西解剖了

1787
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,630
仔细研究然后结束它

1788
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,670
然后给你自己放个假好好休息　斯特里克兰

1789
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,730
- 你做得很棒　- 谢谢你　长官

1790
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,870
快点结束这个任务

1791
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,470
当然　长官

1792
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,080
帮他逃脱　你在说什么

1793
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,450
当然不可以

1794
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,670
这是违法的

1795
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,900
或许谈论这件事也犯法了

1796
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,640
他很孤独

1797
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,620
难道说

1798
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,370
不论何时我们走进一家中餐馆

1799
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,680
你都想把水槽里的每条鱼都救下来吗

1800
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,620
就算他很孤独又怎样

1801
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,040
人生来孤独

1802
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,110
你见过的最悲伤的东西

1803
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,880
你是这样说的　没错吧　你刚刚这样说

1804
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,980
你把它称作是一个东西　东西　是个怪物

1805
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,640
我能理解你

1806
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,300
冷静

1807
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,540
拜托　冷静

1808
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,810
好好好　我说给你听

1809
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,800
我是谁

1810
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,200
我张开嘴

1811
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,940
如他一般

1812
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,980
却无法发声

1813
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,210
如他一般

1814
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,570
什么造就了我

1815
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,420
我自身所有

1816
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,100
我所经历

1817
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,230
将我引至这里

1818
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,600
带我遇见他

1819
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,720
看　你刚刚用的是　他

1820
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:24,800
这是个

1821
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,020
啊　你刚刚打了我

1822
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,950
埃莉莎　放开我

1823
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,990
我算是看清楚了　你以前从来没有打过我

1824
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,310
当他看着我

1825
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,700
他看我的方式

1826
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,790
他不知道

1827
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,900
我的残缺

1828
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,990
或者

1829
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,230
我是多么的

1830
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,940
不完整

1831
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,130
他看着我

1832
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,380
只是因为

1833
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,280
我是我

1834
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,250
他每次

1835
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,180
每天

1836
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,730
看见我

1837
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,910
都很开心

1838
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,680
但是现在

1839
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,360
我要么

1840
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,080
救他

1841
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,260
要么看他死

1842
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,090
好吧

1843
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,870
我要走了

1844
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,680
我得走了啊

1845
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,610
埃莉莎　别这样

1846
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,290
听我说　听我说就好

1847
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,450
我现在得走了

1848
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,810
我现在必须离开　因为

1849
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,270
埃莉莎　这对我非常重要

1850
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,840
这是我再次得到的机会

1851
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,650
我很抱歉　但是我必须走了

1852
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,020
我的天啊

1853
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,040
当我回来的时候

1854
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,810
我们就别再谈这事了

1855
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,520
埃莉莎　那

1856
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,030
好吧

1857
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,600
我们是什么　你和我

1858
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,380
我们什么也不是

1859
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,810
什么也不是　我们什么也做不了

1860
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,540
对不起

1861
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,900
但这一切　这一切就是

1862
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,660
天啊　它甚至不是人

1863
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,680
天啊

1864
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,230
怎么

1865
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,540
贾尔斯

1866
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
我一直在等你

1867
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,590
- 我知道　抱歉　- 没事

1868
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,320
去里面谈

1869
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,600
其实你直接寄过来就行了

1870
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,750
不　我想亲自展示给你们看

1871
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,210
我认为这是我最好的作品之一

1872
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,290
这也改成绿色了

1873
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,080
只是　现在不是时候

1874
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,790
我们迟些再谈

1875
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,470
呃　嗯　行　没问题

1876
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,680
什么时候才是时候呢　伯尼

1877
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,720
那是你画的

1878
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,040
是

1879
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,930
哇

1880
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,560
你很棒

1881
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,730
显然　还没到达照片的逼真度

1882
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,520
但还是很棒　对吗

1883
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,540
反正我可做不到

1884
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,690
来　我请你吧

1885
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,030
请我么

1886
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,660
像你这样的客人十分少见

1887
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,510
你看上去　很有教养

1888
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,150
我喜欢和你聊天

1889
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,320
事实上　我

1890
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,510
我之所以到这来是想

1891
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,420
和我聊天　以及

1892
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,560
这个馅饼绝了　对吧

1893
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,770
对　对

1894
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,320
这不是酸橙派　但也很好吃的

1895
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,480
我没有同事

1896
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,430
呃

1897
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,300
我最好的朋友也不是健谈的人

1898
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,290
你瞧　那就是这个工作的一部分　就像

1899
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,600
酒保一样

1900
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,350
你给他们做馅饼　你也会倾听他们的烦恼

1901
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,640
你才能去了解他们

1902
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,920
我也想多了解你

1903
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,480
你想干嘛　老家伙

1904
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,560
哦　呃

1905
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,420
喂　不行　你们不能坐在吧台上

1906
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,830
你们只能打包带走　不能坐那儿

1907
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,820
你们要吃什么　就下单　然后打包带走

1908
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,820
但这没人呀　这个吧台都没坐人

1909
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,140
今天一天都被包下了　不准坐这儿

1910
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,190
再次光顾　听见了吗

1911
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,140
你没必要用那种口气跟他们说话

1912
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,530
你也走吧

1913
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,000
而且不许再来了　这里只接待亲友

1914
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,300
没人理我了

1915
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,250
你是唯一能和我聊天的人了

1916
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,230
好吧

1917
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,230
不管是啥

1918
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,200
你都要去做

1919
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,220
所以

1920
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,310
告诉我　我能帮你做什么吧

1921
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,780
所有希望都已凋零

1922
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,320
都随着春日而消逝了　走吧

1923
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,180
凯迪拉克德维尔　史上最好的汽车

1924
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,570
V8发动机　390马力　就像崭新的美元大钞一样

1925
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,270
- 我就随便看看　- 我也随便说说

1926
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,090
广播收音　配备空调　电动车窗　电子刹车

1927
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,940
电动方向盘　电动座椅调整

1928
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,350
还可更换豪华内饰

1929
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,020
有143种可供选择　你看

1930
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,270
这就是行走的泰姬陵啊

1931
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,200
嗯

1932
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,970
我不太喜欢这个绿色

1933
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,530
不　这可不是绿色　朋友　这是水鸭色

1934
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,720
- 好吧　看上去就是绿色　- 但你看　这不是绿色

1935
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,750
这可是限量款　有12层喷漆

1936
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,920
纯手工抛光　全镀铬装饰

1937
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,150
全美五分之四的成功人士都选择凯迪拉克

1938
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,660
是吗　这就是大势所趋

1939
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,780
您一看就是能掌控未来的人

1940
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,680
- 什么　- 未来啊

1941
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,110
您就是未来的主宰

1942
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,930
您才配拥有这辆车

1943
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,180
哇

1944
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,910
长官　这车真棒啊

1945
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,620
这是

1946
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,020
要我说　开着它的感觉一定棒极了

1947
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,540
这真是个好看的绿色啊

1948
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,030
是水鸭色

1949
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,580
水鸭色

1950
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,540
- 明天　- 怎么

1951
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,830
- 我做千层肉饼　- 是吗

1952
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,610
专门给你做　多加点葡萄干

1953
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,040
清晨五点　我驾车去卸货台

1954
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,190
那时候他们正在换班

1955
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,610
我有多少时间

1956
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,880
五分钟　我会记得的

1957
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,860
五点　五分钟　五分钟

1958
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,670
再对一下　你负责移动摄像头

1959
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,470
我再和你对下手表的时间

1960
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,030
就像电影里拍的那样

1961
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,820
天啊　我真为你骄傲

1962
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,200
天啊　你一点也不害怕

1963
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,910
什么　你很害怕

1964
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,770
别说了　我都快吓死了

1965
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,140
我觉得这是我最好的作品之一了

1966
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,980
迈克尔　帕克　听起来像是

1967
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,540
老实人的名字　简单粗暴

1968
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,320
对　51岁

1969
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,760
54岁

1970
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,780
你能不能别这么直接

1971
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,240
那就57岁　吧

1972
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,940
我还是戴个假发吧　我能混过去的

1973
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,700
我穿这个还是

1974
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,640
哦　去　去　去　下去

1975
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,230
或者是这件　这件

1976
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,020
穿着就像　我是个有工作的人一样

1977
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,850
但这件　这件

1978
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,480
搭配上奶油色的领带

1979
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,130
就传达出随意而时髦的感觉

1980
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,320
所以　你喜欢这件　我也同意

1981
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,830
我想我们准备好了

1982
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,780
斯特里克兰先生

1983
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:54,340
莎莉　你能打给埃斯波西托小姐来清理一下吗

1984
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,290
你说　我也搞不懂自己

1985
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,190
你又不是大美女　但

1986
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,330
伤脑筋

1987
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,170
我时时想着你

1988
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:10,510
你说你的世界是无声的　是完全说不出话

1989
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,070
还是你也能发出呻吟声呢

1990
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,190
浅浅的呻吟

1991
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,650
我只想让你知道

1992
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,300
我不介意你的疤痕

1993
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,890
我也不介意你不能说话

1994
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,270
你这样跪在我面前的样子

1995
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,550
我很喜欢

1996
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,680
很喜欢

1997
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,280
让我性奋

1998
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,750
我想我也能让你叫出声来

1999
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,010
亲爱的　你还好吗

2000
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,280
快点啦　我想早点回家

2001
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,250
我的脚痛死了

2002
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,470
我们得延迟计划了

2003
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,330
先敲门再进来

2004
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,730
我有急事

2005
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,890
出去　敲门

2006
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,450
我再让你进来说话

2007
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,520
这是礼貌　你要遵守礼节

2008
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:13,920
进来

2009
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,770
我

2010
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,380
你能给我关下门吗

2011
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:24,130
这样才对　说吧

2012
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,520
我需要更多时间

2013
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,090
别让你的挫败感

2014
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,880
还有胜负欲

2015
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:30,930
我没有胜负欲

2016
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,280
我只是不想毁掉一件复杂而美丽的事物

2017
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:42,050
这东西要是死了　你能学到知识　我也能离开

2018
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,200
离开这儿　在新的地方安身

2019
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,940
和我的家人定居在一个美丽的　真正的城市

2020
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,630
这种生物很聪明

2021
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,400
能说话

2022
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,270
能理解感情

2023
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,270
苏联人和朝鲜人不也是吗

2024
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,300
我们不也把他们灭了吗

2025
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,950
记住　这不是动物保护协会

2026
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,840
我也不想再在这个

2027
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,820
鬼地方多呆一会了

2028
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,200
你呢

2029
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,080
鲍勃

2030
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,430
你想在这呆着吗

2031
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,440
不　我不想

2032
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,830
你还在等什么

2033
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,070
你有见到埃莉莎吗

2034
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,920
快点　泽尔达

2035
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,970
是你移动了卸货台的摄像头吗

2036
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,810
你要带他去那儿吗

2037
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,060
从隧洞出去是吗

2038
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,700
真聪明

2039
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,020
是谁指使你这么做的

2040
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,520
这种水必须保持在百分之五到八的盐度

2041
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,990
用食盐就行

2042
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:42,100
每三天就往他的水里加一些这个

2043
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,440
原蛋白的食物是不可少的

2044
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,590
五分钟内　我会在卸货台和你汇合

2045
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,300
我去断电　你做好准备

2046
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,610
斯特里克兰长官

2047
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,880
还有12小时就要进行活体解剖了

2048
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,190
我　我需要您在这上面签字

2049
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,370
停车

2050
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,690
你叫　迈克尔　帕克

2051
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,500
君子行不更名

2052
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,220
你是疯了吗

2053
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,230
别这么做　埃莉莎

2054
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,890
别这么做

2055
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,030
那是　那是什么车

2056
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:31,430
呃　我也不确定　是洗衣房的车吗

2057
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,230
但　也不是在这个时候来

2058
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,090
长官

2059
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,930
- 在卸货台和我汇合　- 长官

2060
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,600
- 长官　有何吩咐　- 快去叫人

2061
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,650
先生　从车里出来

2062
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:09,890
天啊　我最不会处理这种事了

2063
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,340
快出来

2064
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,520
我不会再重复一遍

2065
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,980
- 天啊　别开枪　- 出来

2066
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,360
天啊　别开枪

2067
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,030
你还在等什么　我们没时间了

2068
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,640
快出来

2069
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,070
我们得走了　快点

2070
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,190
哦　你个蠢女人　我们会下地狱的

2071
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,690
快点　推

2072
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,050
推呀

2073
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:40,300
推啊

2074
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,380
我发誓我不是故意的

2075
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,840
我总是不会弄这些机械化的东西

2076
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:50,620
什么

2077
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,240
她在卸货台等你

2078
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,650
- 快点　去啊　- 好　我这就去

2079
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,860
那是谁　他刚好像杀了人

2080
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,680
噢

2081
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,080
噢　天啊　天啊

2082
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,430
我们准备好了吗　真准备好了吗

2083
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,370
他真美丽

2084
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,700
是我撞的吗

2085
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,710
我真不会开车

2086
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,570
快点　快点

2087
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:40,620
不

2088
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,990
不

2089
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:09,300
盐　你说什么　盐

2090
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,140
埃莉莎

2091
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,870
以色列的爆竹

2092
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,600
有闻到镁的味道吗

2093
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,780
俄罗斯人不喜欢犹太人

2094
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,740
却不得不用他们生产的玩意

2095
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,020
他们是怎么进来的

2096
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,900
呃　假身份和假牌照

2097
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,310
之类的

2098
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,000
他们还把卸货台的监控头掉了方向　先生

2099
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,980
先别传出消息　我们有一天时间来处理

2100
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,870
我已经上报了

2101
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,250
- 你上报了　- 事件一发生我就　就

2102
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,370
斯特里克兰先生

2103
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:55,330
怎么了　莎莉

2104
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,880
先生　霍伊特将军打电话来

2105
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,850
斯特里克兰　那东西就是我们的太空狗

2106
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,280
- 你知道的　- 先生　我会把它抓回来的

2107
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,830
我不　不能再有负面想法了　先生

2108
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,250
你感觉很好是吗

2109
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,270
我有信心　能把它抓回来

2110
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,060
你能做到的　你会做到的

2111
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,900
为我那么做好吧　孩子　为了我

2112
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,120
这是你计划放走他的日子吗

2113
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,900
十号

2114
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,240
万一没雨呢

2115
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,970
水道会怎么样

2116
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,670
行吧

2117
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,020
那是什么

2118
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,280
我看看

2119
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,990
那是给我的

2120
01:11:57,450 --> 01:12:01,600
不错　你就这么保持着吧

2121
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,100
装作什么也不知道

2122
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,310
万一我被问到就只能求上天保佑了

2123
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,360
我不擅长撒谎啊

2124
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,110
骗布鲁斯特我倒拿手

2125
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,370
为了维系这段婚姻我撒了很多谎

2126
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:18,220
全体注意　请出示你们的身份证和门禁卡

2127
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,970
天啊　这是

2128
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,130
看你让我们陷入什么麻烦里

2129
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:32,110
依我看　我们要对付的是一个经过高度训练的组织　先生

2130
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,070
我想到的　或许是

2131
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,570
特种部队或之类的

2132
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,320
你是说　苏联特种部队

2133
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,370
可能是　我　我是说　他们都是受过训练的

2134
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,670
也有资金支持　精英组织

2135
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,890
高效　冷酷　精确

2136
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,810
整个过程用时不到五分钟　长官

2137
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,840
我保守估计　这是个至少有十个人的

2138
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,440
突击部队

2139
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,580
你一直都是一个人吗

2140
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,100
你有过其他人吗

2141
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,920
你知道你身上发生了什么事吗　你知道吗

2142
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,110
因为我不知道　我不知道自己发生了什么

2143
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,500
我不知道

2144
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,010
我看镜子时　唯一能认出的

2145
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,510
只有这双眼睛

2146
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,440
在一张沧桑的老脸上

2147
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:37,960
有时候我会觉得

2148
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,850
自己生不逢时

2149
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,580
我们都被这乱世所遗弃了

2150
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,950
安保系统已升至最高等级

2151
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:53,070
请准备出示你的身份和门禁卡

2152
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,990
长官　找到她们了

2153
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,550
泽尔达　埃莉莎

2154
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,710
看起来你们在事发前就下班了

2155
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,990
但例行公事

2156
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:20,620
如果你们知道任何有关线索

2157
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:23,720
你们有义务向我报告

2158
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,740
哪怕看起来微不足道的细节

2159
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,520
微不足道意思是不重要的

2160
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:33,400
我没注意到任何不正常的事情

2161
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,930
或者微不足道的事情

2162
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,730
我的脚一直很痛

2163
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,910
你呢

2164
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,080
她什么也没注意到

2165
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,280
霍夫斯特勒　霍夫斯特勒博士

2166
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,960
你们有看见他出入实验室吗

2167
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,060
他在那工作　不是吗

2168
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:02,990
我意思不是工作性质的　在做些不寻常的事情

2169
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,220
微不足道的事吗

2170
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,440
没有　长官

2171
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,360
我在干嘛

2172
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,620
竟然在向你们询求帮助

2173
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:30,190
倒垃圾的

2174
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,610
扫厕所的

2175
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,050
你们走吧　出去

2176
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,770
你在对我说什么

2177
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,740
她在说什么

2178
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,410
我没看见

2179
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,250
她在说什么

2180
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,650
她说　谢谢您

2181
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,110
下一个

2182
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:35,720
你昨晚没来看我

2183
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,700
前天晚上也是

2184
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,460
我很抱歉　但既然现在

2185
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,960
我不用成天工作

2186
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:43,670
卡洛认为我需要在晚上陪她

2187
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,970
要是你在晚上陪她

2188
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:47,640
我什么时候才能见你

2189
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:58,160
看来我们只能做一件事了

2190
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,390
志愿者

2191
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,940
不不不不

2192
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,420
我想早点回家

2193
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:00,160
最近布鲁斯特脾气很差

2194
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,570
我的天

2195
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:05,970
你躲在女更衣室里

2196
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,980
干什么

2197
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,120
他们可能在监视我　这里没有摄像头

2198
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,180
不错的理由啊

2199
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,090
要是你撞到我们在换衣服呢

2200
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,830
我需要知道他是否安好

2201
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,240
- 他很好　- 什么时候放他走

2202
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:17,350
很快

2203
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,800
当通海水道被雨水灌满的时候

2204
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,460
有需要就找我

2205
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,720
尽快放他走

2206
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,540
她说什么

2207
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:35,080
她说　你是个好人　霍夫斯特勒博士

2208
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,200
我的名字是迪米特里

2209
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,080
很荣幸认识你们

2210
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,820
嘿　哑巴　有电话找你　很紧急

2211
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,190
先别管我　我没事

2212
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,070
相信我　我没事

2213
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,030
他把潘多拉吃了　不是他的错

2214
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,280
他毕竟有野性的

2215
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,980
我们不能要求太多

2216
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,730
埃莉莎　快去找他

2217
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,470
快去

2218
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,210
去吧

2219
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,140
你很幸运

2220
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,240
我一直尽力保持清醒

2221
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,120
但是　我还是老了

2222
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,300
他还好吗　你确定

2223
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,290
你去哪

2224
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,770
别

2225
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:36,520
好吧　不不　别跟猫咪玩了　别

2226
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:37,960
别跟猫咪玩

2227
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:40,560
我没生气　我没有

2228
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:56,360
这是你干的　但没关系

2229
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,670
我觉得这有点不卫生

2230
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
可以了

2231
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,110
这家伙挺有意思

2232
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:22,460
请准备出示你的身份证和门禁卡

2233
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,010
你找我

2234
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,210
调查怎么样了

2235
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,780
我已经有些眉目了

2236
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,690
是吗

2237
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,020
那真挺好

2238
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,350
你在加尔维斯顿加入我们的

2239
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:42,840
你之前在哪工作　霍夫斯特勒

2240
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,790
博士

2241
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,610
- 什么　- 霍夫斯特勒博士

2242
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,200
这是礼貌

2243
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:53,890
我在威斯康星大学麦迪逊校区

2244
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,540
对　你放弃了

2245
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,290
终身教授的职位　对吧

2246
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:01,160
为了我们　放弃了一切

2247
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,990
我猜想

2248
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,920
你现在已经打算离开我们了吧

2249
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,790
如果那个生物没有被找到的话

2250
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,480
那你怎么想　你觉得我们能找到它吗

2251
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,880
你说你已经有点眉目了

2252
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,240
我确实有

2253
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,240
亲爱的　你在笑什么

2254
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,640
别这副表情

2255
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,390
你们发生什么了

2256
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,540
怎么会发生

2257
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,160
他怎么可能

2258
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,260
怎么做到的

2259
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,880
他有吗

2260
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,720
我的天啊

2261
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,430
永远别相信男人

2262
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,170
即使他下面看上去空无一物

2263
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,520
你按的铃吗

2264
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,640
彼特　我刚报名了人类学

2265
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,050
我们要去

2266
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:09,470
南美的亚马逊丛林上课

2267
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,040
南美　我天呐

2268
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,470
那你可得起个大早了

2269
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:13,530
那地方太远了

2270
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,380
不　彼特　我们要呆在那里

2271
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,340
我们吗

2272
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,010
不　你不会不来吧

2273
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:21,670
试试吉利丁果冻

2274
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,530
你会喜欢它的

2275
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:25,370
爸爸　我们能看伯南扎的牛仔吗

2276
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,260
那部片子太暴力了

2277
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,690
你知道我今天在想什么吗

2278
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,440
我们该给孩子一只宠物狗

2279
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,830
怎么回事啊

2280
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:24,250
水都灌进我的剧院了

2281
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,410
有四个顾客都买票了　我还得退钱给人家

2282
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,130
可能是个管道问题　我会处理的

2283
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,340
你修不好就别住了

2284
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,440
我会修好的

2285
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,800
埃莉莎

2286
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,400
上帝啊

2287
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,720
埃莉莎

2288
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,240
我在擦我的头发

2289
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,500
我的头发

2290
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,190
还有我的手臂

2291
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,270
那个伤口　就像从没有过一样　看

2292
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,670
你说过

2293
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,360
他被供奉为神灵

2294
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:40,860
他是上帝吗　我不知道他是不是

2295
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:43,830
毕竟他吃过一只猫　我真不知道

2296
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,550
我们得让他多留一段时间

2297
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:48,650
只要一小段

2298
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:09,370
喂

2299
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,780
你的水　长官

2300
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,290
还有长官　霍伊特将军

2301
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,400
告诉他我不在　我一会打给他

2302
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,360
别把他接进来

2303
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:00,780
不是的　长官

2304
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,620
他已经在你的办公室了

2305
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:08,640
在这个节骨眼上　我们当务之急就是那个研究对象

2306
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:11,760
- 你找到它了吗　- 还没有　长官

2307
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,080
这不太妙啊

2308
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:16,440
是　长官　我知道

2309
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,540
你认识我多久了　长官

2310
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,300
十三年

2311
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,770
- 釜山战役　- 是的长官

2312
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:28,000
一个男人　毕生虔诚　忠心　高效

2313
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:34,470
他还很能干　并期待着

2314
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,580
他当然想着获得对等的回报

2315
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,470
然后他失败了　一次

2316
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,090
只有一次　那导致了什么

2317
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,120
这会使他成为一个失败者吗

2318
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:54,800
当这个男人完成任务　证明自己

2319
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,840
是个好人

2320
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:59,460
一个体面可敬的人

2321
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,250
体面

2322
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:12,710
一个体面的人可不会搞砸事情

2323
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,430
那是一种体面　一种真正的体面可敬

2324
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,320
但其他类型的体面

2325
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,290
就没什么用了

2326
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,420
我们摈弃它　更像是自我提升

2327
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:26,770
因为我们不需要它

2328
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,730
三十六小时后一切都结束了

2329
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,810
包括你

2330
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,600
你将从我们的世界里消失

2331
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:48,040
你会去另一个世界

2332
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,300
一个糟糕透顶的世界

2333
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,880
你会在那片文明里迷失

2334
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,920
你的痕迹会被抹除

2335
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,640
一干

2336
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,030
二净

2337
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,670
去追求些真正的体面吧　小伙子

2338
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,560
还有收拾好这个烂摊子

2339
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:56,480
三十六小时

2340
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,640
三十六小时　去送货

2341
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,920
你就干这活　送货的

2342
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,460
对吧

2343
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:08,900
你永远

2344
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:21,200
不会知道

2345
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,480
我有

2346
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,120
多么

2347
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:30,830
爱你

2348
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:32,560
埃莉莎

2349
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,290
怎么了　亲爱的

2350
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:52,730
这不太妙啊

2351
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:57,400
我去给霍夫斯特勒博士打电话

2352
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,740
亲爱的　我们今天必须放他走

2353
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,580
我会过来帮你

2354
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:29,560
他要出来了

2355
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,140
该死的

2356
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,970
长官　恕我直言

2357
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,680
你看起来不太好

2358
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:47,470
闭嘴

2359
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,490
你闻到了吗　我是说

2360
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:54,290
我觉得你的手指　它们

2361
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:55,730
变黑了

2362
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:02,260
他来了

2363
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:04,520
该死的狗屁博士

2364
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,650
没必要咒骂　长官

2365
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,010
你出去　我要用你的车

2366
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:16,690
- 这是我的车　- 快给我滚出去

2367
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,380
从我的车里

2368
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,610
我表达得不够清楚吗

2369
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:55,130
太好了　斯特里克兰

2370
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,000
你在说俄语

2371
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:59,020
鲍勃

2372
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,220
- 你的名字是什么　- 霍夫斯特勒

2373
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:16,080
不不　别撒谎　你不需要

2374
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,770
你肚子中弹了

2375
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:20,250
你马上要死了

2376
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:22,110
告诉我突击队所有人的

2377
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:24,170
姓名　军衔和地址

2378
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:26,230
突击队

2379
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,580
那些带走研究对象的人

2380
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:41,090
这种糖　很便宜　但我爱吃

2381
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:43,040
从我小时候就开始

2382
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:46,740
现在很多人偏爱那些更精细的零食

2383
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:50,590
牛扎糖　还有那些杂七杂八的

2384
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:52,470
但我不是　鲍勃

2385
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:54,960
我就爱吃这个

2386
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,850
有时当我觉得紧张的时候

2387
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:01,470
我就大嚼一通

2388
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,310
但大多数情况

2389
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,350
我会细细品尝

2390
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:07,270
直到最后一点

2391
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:16,210
突击队的姓名　军衔还有地址

2392
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,160
姓名和军衔

2393
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,250
没有姓名

2394
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,060
没有军衔

2395
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,150
他们

2396
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,780
他们身家清白（清洁工）

2397
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,100
布鲁斯特　我给你做晚饭

2398
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,590
然后我要出去一小会

2399
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:52,010
去帮朋友一个忙

2400
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,830
- 帮什么　- 就是帮忙呗

2401
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,490
泽尔达

2402
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:01,360
门

2403
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:07,600
也许你可以帮我去开下门

2404
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,150
你就坐在离门十尺的地方

2405
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,760
我的背很痛啊　女人　快让开

2406
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:14,060
你的背　你的背　永远都是你的背

2407
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,380
斯特里克兰先生

2408
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:20,540
你来这干什么

2409
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:23,500
- 这个男人是谁　泽尔达　- 他在哪

2410
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,180
- 你在说什么　- 你把他带到哪里去了

2411
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,460
- 泽尔达　- 你在说什么

2412
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,510
我不明白

2413
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,710
在实验室的

2414
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,930
那个东西

2415
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:34,860
在哪

2416
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:36,900
- 听着　老兄　- 坐　下

2417
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,690
不好意思　先生　如果

2418
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:50,060
我知道什么　我肯定会告诉你

2419
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,280
我还没告诉你

2420
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,540
参孙故事的结局

2421
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:02,590
在腓力斯人对他严刑拷打

2422
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,370
还把他弄瞎后

2423
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:08,920
参孙向上帝祈求力量

2424
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,950
在最后一刻　他变的气急败坏

2425
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:17,620
但就在那时上帝给予了他所要的力量

2426
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,940
最后一刻

2427
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:25,090
而后他用他有力的手

2428
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:30,770
抓住神庙里的大柱

2429
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:33,820
他把它们捏碎

2430
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:48,650
整座神庙都塌了　砸死了腓力斯人

2431
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:55,710
虽然他也死了

2432
01:48:55,740 --> 01:49:00,200
但他让那些杂碎都为他陪了葬

2433
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:02,390
那就是他的愿望

2434
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:10,990
你知道这个故事影射什么吗

2435
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,440
放在我们身上　达丽拉

2436
01:49:14,150 --> 01:49:16,710
它影射了　你知道些内情但却没告诉我

2437
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:18,220
你会告诉我

2438
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:21,000
无论是

2439
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,610
在我

2440
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:25,480
拆掉你家之前

2441
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:29,640
还是之后

2442
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,410
那个哑巴从实验室偷了那个东西

2443
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,730
不管那是什么

2444
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,460
是哑女把它带走了

2445
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:39,350
我之前听到我老婆在电话里说这件事

2446
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:47,820
万分感谢你　福勒先生

2447
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:00,460
你干了什么

2448
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:03,110
- 泽尔达　- 我得去提醒她

2449
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,230
他去找她了

2450
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:06,340
女人　你不许干这种事

2451
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:08,060
你管她干嘛

2452
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:09,590
她犯法了

2453
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,680
闭嘴　布鲁斯特

2454
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,080
你给我闭嘴

2455
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,090
这么多年来你都保持沉默

2456
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:17,290
现在却闭不上嘴了

2457
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,940
去你大爷的　布鲁斯特

2458
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:23,500
你永远不明白

2459
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,530
再怎么努力也不会明白的　永远

2460
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:30,710
- 喂　- 贾尔斯是你吗

2461
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,630
- 是　- 好　帮我叫埃莉莎来

2462
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:34,320
泽尔达

2463
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,130
埃莉莎　宝贝

2464
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,210
如果听见给我点声音

2465
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:41,520
好的

2466
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:43,290
他来找你了

2467
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:45,440
你现在就得带上他走

2468
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,280
什么　埃莉莎

2469
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:29,540
该死的

2470
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,610
我们必须得走了

2471
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,290
你在哪

2472
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:48,800
你他妈在哪

2473
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,870
我没有失败

2474
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:17,030
我送到了

2475
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:23,160
埃莉莎

2476
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:25,700
埃莉莎

2477
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:35,910
不

2478
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:25,260
我天

2479
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,270
你真的是神

2480
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:36,750
如果我要讲关于她的故事

2481
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:38,390
我该怎么说呢

2482
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,320
从此他们永远幸福快乐的生活在一起了

2483
01:57:42,110 --> 01:57:43,580
我相信是的

2484
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,280
他们相爱

2485
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,230
他们永远相爱

2486
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:50,160
我确信这是真的

2487
01:57:51,370 --> 01:57:53,360
但当我想到她

2488
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,450
想到埃莉莎

2489
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:59,520
我的脑海里只会出现一首诗

2490
01:57:59,710 --> 01:58:01,700
那是几百年前

2491
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:03,850
一对爱人的呢喃情话

2492
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,310
难以描绘你的形状

2493
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:10,540
你却如水　围绕着我

2494
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,290
你的存在

2495
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:14,860
使我眼中满是你的爱意

2496
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,340
柔软了我的心

2497
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:19,640
因你无处不在

2498
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,410
那是暗号

2499
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,910
鹰叼走了自己的猎物

2500
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,950
走吧

2501
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,580
鲍勃

2502
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,250
最近怎么样

2503
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,310
我像个傻子一样坐在混凝土块上

2504
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,180
等了你一个小时

2505
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,150
我们每次都在这个烂餐厅接头

2506
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,510
我会换地方的

2507
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,680
但是你没有

2508
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:05,710
告诉我们

2509
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,680
鲍勃

2510
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,410
我是迪米特里

2511
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,450
同志

2512
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,410
我不是鲍勃

2513
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,280
这是什么

2514
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,680
迪米特里

2515
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,550
解剖学笔记

2516
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:16,910
还有

2517
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
实验室的布局

2518
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,310
也就是研究这家伙的地方

2519
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,980
我们抽身所需要的一切

2520
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
都在这儿了

2521
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
我会向上头报告的

2522
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,150
我们得尽快搞定它

2523
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,980
马尔可夫

2524
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,150
我认为

2525
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,010
这个生物

2526
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,210
可能会交流

2527
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:35,980
交流

2528
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,310
是的 与我们交流

2529
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,980
我有理由相信

2530
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,580
他是智慧生物

2531
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:45,880
它能

2532
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,550
它能对

2533
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,080
语言

2534
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,150
音乐做出反应

2535
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,580
这些你也能

2536
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,650
向上级报告吗

2537
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,680
我会的

2538
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,310
现在就

2539
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,150
开吃吧 迪米特里

2540
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,820
他们把这叫做

2541
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,650
海鲜

2542
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,880
牛排

2543
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,350
海鲜牛排套餐

2544
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,450
这里的龙虾肉处理得正好

2545
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,010
滋啦滋啦的

2546
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,450
就是

2547
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:17,910
有点软

2548
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,610
有点甜

2549
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,110
莫斯科不会支持你的计划的

2550
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,580
为什么

2551
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,430
太冒险了

2552
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,380
时间太急

2553
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,580
什么

2554
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,850
迪米特里 我们只有两个选择

2555
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:58,910
一个是

2556
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,850
你想办法推迟计划

2557
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,250
至少一周

2558
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,750
但他们明天就要动手了

2559
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:07,610
那

2560
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
只能用

2561
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,580
第二个办法

2562
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,780
以色列 爆竹

2563
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:20,050
你把它装在保险盒上

2564
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,750
能断电五到十分钟

2565
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,950
监控失效 你也没有了阻碍

2566
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,940
然后

2567
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,780
将这个注射到它身上

2568
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,480
给它注射

2569
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,850
杀了它

2570
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,180
毁掉它

2571
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,980
你还好吧

2572
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,450
我来到这个国家

2573
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,580
尽我所能地学习

2574
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,780
既是因为爱国

2575
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,110
也因为我热爱科学

2576
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,480
这里还有很多东西需要我们学习

2577
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,310
我们不需要学习

2578
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,350
我们只要让美国人

2579
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,980
无处可学

2580
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:14,280
请进

2581
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:17,250
你的撤退文件

2582
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,210
快准备好了

2583
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:23,750
但首先 我有个问题问你

2584
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,910
您说

2585
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:29,750
你们要不要来点

2586
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:31,880
黄油蛋糕

2587
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,150
好啊

2588
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,310
那个东西

2589
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:41,650
你给它注射后

2590
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,550
尸体怎么处理的

2591
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:46,310
我有点好奇

2592
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,750
我对它进行了解剖

2593
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,810
没发现任何价值

2594
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,510
正如列宁说的

2595
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,780
变质之鱼 毫无价值

2596
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,680
列宁

2597
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:08,380
说过这话吗

2598
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:20,550
蛋糕不错

2599
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:23,150
你这儿有牛奶吗

2600
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,450
或许

2601
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:33,550
可能

2602
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,380
可能是

2603
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,710
你记错了吧

2604
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,450
等我们的回音

2605
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,550
不会很久的

2606
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:11,110
撤退

2607
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:12,810
已被批准

2608
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,150
四十八小时后

2609
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,980
老地方见

2610
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:20,280
四十八小时吗

2611
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,210
四十八小时

2612
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,350
雨下得真大啊

2613
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:14,410
今天不说暗号吗

2614
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,050
不要 同志 不要

2615
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:27,710
不要

2616
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,150
求你了

2617
