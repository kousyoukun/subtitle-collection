00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,235
<i>If I spoke about it...</i>

3
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,806
<i>If I did...</i>

4
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:58,073
<i>what would I tell you?</i>

5
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,443
<i>I wonder.</i>

6
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:03,946
<i>Would I tell you
about the time?</i>

7
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:06,681
<i>It happened a long time ago,
it seems...</i>

8
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:09,886
<i>in the last days
of a fair prince's reign.</i>

9
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,891
<i>Or would I tell you
about the place?</i>

10
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,526
<i>A small city near the coast...</i>

11
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,897
<i>but far from everything else.</i>

12
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,202
<i>Or, I don't know.</i>

13
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:28,706
<i>Would I tell you about her?</i>

14
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:32,243
<i>The princess without voice.</i>

15
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:36,712
<i>Or perhaps
I would just warn you</i>

16
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,683
<i>about the truth
of these facts...</i>

17
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:42,153
<i>and the tale
of love and loss...</i>

18
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:48,726
<i>and the monster who tried
to destroy it all.</i>

19
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,778
<i>My Lord Hedak.</i>

20
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,516
<i>So, you are troubled.
Tell me.</i>

21
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:52,053
<i>I've...</i>

22
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,856
<i>I have sinned.
I've offended the god.</i>

23
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:57,791
<i>I am deep in sin,
my Lord Hedak.</i>

24
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,361
<i>Let me judge of that.</i>

25
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,967
<i>I've doubted the ceremony
of the sacrifice.</i>

26
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,546
<i>I don't want to go up there.</i>

27
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:28,416
<i>Why, everybody's got
to go upstairs, Miss Lloyd,</i>

28
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:30,919
<i>if they wants to go to bed.</i>

29
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:34,156
The sirens wake you up?
There was a fire.

30
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:36,060
The chocolate factory.

31
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:39,727
Do you smell that?

32
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,563
Oh, my!

33
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:42,933
Toasted cocoa.

34
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,704
Tragedy and delight,
hand in hand.

35
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:50,505
Oh, my dear child.

36
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:53,674
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

37
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,777
I am the proverbial
starving...

38
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,113
Watch this.

39
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,751
It's Bojangles,
the stair dance.

40
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:04,852
Oh, that's so hard.
Cagney did it.

41
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,322
Different, but beautiful.

42
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,991
<i>- I wanna do that, too.
- All right!</i>

43
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:11,459
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yup.</i>

44
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:12,659
<i>Come on.</i>

45
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:15,166
<i>Ah!</i>

46
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,435
<i>Say, you catch on quick.</i>

47
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,738
<i>Look out now.
Here's your last one!</i>

48
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,039
Elisa!

49
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:00,808
Next time you come
to bring the rent...

50
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,945
I want you to stay
and see the Bible movie, huh!

51
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:05,546
I have... I have two
free tickets here.

52
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:08,282
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

53
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:09,753
Bible movie and comedy!

54
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:11,685
Nobody's coming
to the theater, huh?

55
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:15,123
I'll throw in a free
popcorn and soda!

56
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,090
Oh, no!

57
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:18,092
For God's sake,
there are two "S's" there!

58
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:22,162
Come on! Two "S."
"Mardi Grass!" "Mardi Grass!"

59
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,231
Two "S."

60
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:29,897
<i>All new personnel,
be advised that sector 12</i>

61
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,767
<i>has now been cleared
to level A safety.</i>

62
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:35,535
Elisa! Come on.
I'm here already.

63
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:36,803
You gotta learn to be on time.

64
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,473
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't cut in, dummy!

65
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,610
Leave her alone, woman.
I was keeping her place.

66
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:44,612
I get reported, I come
after you and the mute.

67
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,450
You do that, Yolanda.
You do that.

68
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:03,831
My feet are already
killing me.

69
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,899
I made Brewster
pigs in a blanket

70
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,702
tonight before leaving...

71
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,704
and boy, he just ate 'em up.

72
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:13,241
No "thank-yous",
no "yum-yums".

73
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:15,076
Not a peep.

74
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,678
Man is as silent as a grave.

75
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,114
But if farts were flattery...

76
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,951
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

77
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,319
Then I get home
and I make him breakfast.

78
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,856
Eggs, bacon,
and buttered toast.

79
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,890
I butter
the man's toast, Elisa.

80
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,558
Mmm-hmm, both sides....

81
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,961
as if he was a child.

82
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,230
And I don't even
get a thank-you.

83
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:37,332
You'd be grateful

84
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,199
because you're
an educated woman.

85
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,068
But my Brewster,
all he had going for him

86
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,270
was animal magnetism
back in the day.

87
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,640
Hasn't worked in a while.

88
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:48,375
What in the Sam Hill? No!

89
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,811
You boys mind putting
the trash in the can?

90
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,349
That's what it's there for.

91
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,917
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

92
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,552
All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!

93
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,187
I don't know
what they're doing.

94
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:01,088
Making a goddamn mess
is what I think.

95
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,592
Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.

96
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:04,759
Yes, sir.

97
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,028
There's no call
for the blasphemy.

98
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,966
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

99
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,333
A moment of your time!

100
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:15,603
Today, we are receiving
a new team

101
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:17,804
and asset here in T-4.

102
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:19,140
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler

103
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:21,242
from our sister facility
in Galveston.

104
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:25,447
Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matter

105
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,217
but this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

106
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:32,053
ever to be housed
in this facility.

107
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:53,106
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?

108
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:55,112
Just one moment, please.

109
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:59,614
Security! Who's security?

110
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:01,283
Welcome to T-4, sir.

111
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,384
Yes, sir, I am Fleming,
head of Security.

112
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,752
And if there are questions
you have or concerns...

113
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:07,054
you just come talk to me.

114
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,503
Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

115
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,670
Get them out.

116
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,755
Help me move this
cylinder into the compressor.

117
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:46,296
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

118
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:52,433
Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.

119
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:54,034
We need to pressurize it
immediately.

120
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,507
- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!

121
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:58,807
Come on!

122
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,975
Lord, what goes on
in this place?

123
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:02,043
Did you see that?

124
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,530
Yes, I'm wearing
the hairpiece.

125
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:24,465
How does it look?

126
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:27,103
Oh! Be careful of the car.

127
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:29,971
And it's not a hairpiece.

128
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:32,108
It's a toupee. It's French.

129
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,842
<i>It's eternal, see?</i>

130
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:38,279
Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death....

131
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,981
because the fruit
on the branches

132
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:42,183
was just always
out of his reach...

133
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,885
and the water
in the stream receded

134
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,687
every time he
stooped down to drink.

135
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,423
And so that's why
we say things today like...

136
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,994
"Look at those
tantalizing pies."

137
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:56,132
Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?

138
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,665
Yes, pies for breakfast.

139
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,236
Just trust me on this.

140
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,338
Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.

141
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,939
I've seen you
in here before, right?

142
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:07,241
Yes.

143
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,809
I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.

144
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:10,144
Partial to key lime pie?

145
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:13,981
I am, I am.
Two to go.

146
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:16,149
Just go with it,
please. Please.

147
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:19,621
Uh, I, uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.

148
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:22,557
Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.

149
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,259
No, no, it's a mighty
fine pie, key lime.

150
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:26,394
You wouldn't happen to be

151
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,995
the famous "Dixie Doug"
himself, would you?

152
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:29,164
Oh, heck no.

153
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,597
The pies are trucked
throughout the country.

154
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,201
- They call it "franchising," see?
- Oh.

155
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,135
They give us the spinners,
the signage.

156
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:37,072
That there's "Pie Boy,"
our mascot.

157
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:38,204
I don't talk like that.

158
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,542
I'm from Ottawa.

159
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,545
No.

160
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,480
I completely bought it.

161
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,850
"That's-a-great-a-pie."

162
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,419
The... The, uh...

163
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,291
The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?

164
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:57,424
I guess so.

165
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:59,262
Well, it's very clever.

166
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,601
Y'all come back now, you hear?

167
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:08,604
"Y'all come back now."

168
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:13,241
Do you think he meant it?

169
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,878
He had noticed me.
I mean, you... you heard that.

170
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:21,716
This pie is rather sordid.

171
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,284
But don't spit it out.

172
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,419
Next time we go,

173
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:26,254
we'll just try
a different flavor. Hmm?

174
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,625
Save it for later,
put it away.

177
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,701
<i>as a cool North wind rustles across...</i>

178
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:41,169

180
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:45,073
Oh, dear God!
Change that awfulness.

181
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,944
I do not wanna see that.

182
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,680
I do not wanna see it.

Oh, that's better,

185
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,117
Oh, look at Betty.

186
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,120
Oh, God, to be young
and beautiful.

187
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:02,557
If I could go back
to when I was 18...

188
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,991
I didn't know anything
about anything,

189
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:05,595
I'd give myself
a bit of advice.

190
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:09,831
I would say, "Take better
care of your teeth...

191
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,698
and fuck a lot more."

192
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,601
Oh no, no, that's very good advice.

00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:08,325
Will you look at this?

196
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:10,491
Look.

197
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,992
Some of the best
minds in the country

198
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:15,029
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

199
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,465
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

200
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:20,333
There's pee freckles
on the ceiling now.

201
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,038
How'd they get it up there?

202
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:26,575
Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?

203
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:30,714
They get enough practice,
that's for sure.

204
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,215
My Brewster...

205
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,417
no one's ever called him
a great mind,

206
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,822
but even he manages
to hit the can

207
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:42,059
70% of the time.

208
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:47,495
Excuse us, sir.

209
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,597
No, no, no,
that's all right.

210
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,767
Go ahead.

211
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:56,069
You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.

212
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,773
Girl talk, no doubt.

213
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,377
Don't mind me.

214
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,885
Elisa.

215
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,121
Look, don't touch.

216
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:15,488
That lovely dingus
right there

217
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,024
is an Alabama Howdy-do.

218
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:18,525
Molded grip handle...

219
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:21,428
low current, high-voltage,
electric shock cattle prod.

220
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,965
Name's Strickland, Security.

221
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,065
Fleming's security.

222
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,008
Oh, no.

223
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,677
No, a man washes his hands

224
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,746
before or after
tending to his needs.

225
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,017
It tells you a lot
about a man.

226
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,553
He does it both times...

227
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:47,824
points to a weakness
in character.

228
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,461
Ladies.

229
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:58,000
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

230
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:21,721
<i>Short people are mean.</i>

231
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:23,158
I never met a short man

232
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,092
that stayed nice
all the way through.

233
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,460
No, sir.

234
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:28,831
Mean little backstabbers,
all of them.

235
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:31,698
Maybe it's the air down there,

236
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,502
not enough oxygen
or something.

237
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:03,229
Help! He's losing blood!

238
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,297
Help!

239
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,600
Come on, come on.

240
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,573
You think
the Russians broke in?

241
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:14,007
I don't think so.

242
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:15,176
And if they did...

243
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,778
Duane's meatloaf
will kill them all, honey.

244
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,413
It was two shots.
Did you hear them?

245
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:22,749
All right, three.
And that scream.

246
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,552
Lord, what ever happens
in this place?

247
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,623
You two, come with me.

248
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:28,790
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?

249
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,791
Any chance we get
to conclude our dinner?

250
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,629
Now!

251
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,764
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

252
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,198
We are in a pickle.

253
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,235
We are in such a pickle.

254
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:51,911
You will have
exactly 20 minutes

255
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,680
to render this... this lab
immaculate, and so on and so forth.

256
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:56,719
20 minutes.

257
00:19:58,453 --> 00:20:00,890
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

258
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:03,660
I can handle pee.

259
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:06,494
I can handle poo.

260
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,595
But blood... Ugh.

261
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:11,465
Blood just does
something to me.

262
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,934
Here, hon. Help me mop it up.

263
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,139
The sooner we get outta here
the better.

264
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,888
Is that a tater tot?

265
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:34,557
Oh!

266
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:36,726
It's a finger.

267
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:39,560
There's two fingers.

268
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:40,727
Okay, okay.

269
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,630
Put them away.
And just wait here.

270
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.

271
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:20,368
Where are these body parts?

272
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,638
The body parts?

273
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,676
No, I believe you, honey.

274
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,881
But are you sure it was alive?

275
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:35,149
Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent...

276
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:38,384
and it was a monkey
sewn to the tail of a fish.

277
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:39,388
Looked real to me.

278
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:42,255
All right, I apologize.

279
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:43,959
Oh! I have a deadline.

280
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:46,192
Do you know,

281
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:49,164
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

282
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,401
Didn't work.

283
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:55,870
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

284
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,906
She was a huge star, huge.

285
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,774
And one day, she couldn't
take the bullshit

286
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:01,978
and the backstabbing anymore.

287
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:05,246
She just walked away
from it all.

288
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,346
Ta-da!

289
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:07,415
That's not bad, is it?

290
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,852
For being shit.

291
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:14,220
Listen. You eat,
you go to bed, you rest.

292
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:17,257

No, we don't get pie.
I get pie.

303
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:01,567
Green. They want the gelatin
to be green now.

304
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:03,737
- I was told red.
- New concept.

305
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:06,105
That's the future now.
Green.

306
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,409
Oh, and they want them
happier, the family.

307
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:11,312
- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.

308
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:12,178
The father looks like

309
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,479
he just discovered
the missionary position.

310
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,614
Giles.

311
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:17,383
Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?

312
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:20,220
The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.

313
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:22,255
It's too bad.
This is nice work.

314
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:25,161
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

315
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,428
How are you holding up?
You drinking?

316
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,931
No, not a drop. No.

317
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:35,201
Are you getting any work since
you left Klein and Saunders?

318
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:37,705
You mean since I was asked
to leave by you.

319
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,407
We are not
getting into this now.

320
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:42,011
I wanna come back, Bernie.

321
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:46,782
We'll see.
Now, do this.

322
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:50,717
I think we're making
great progress.

323
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:51,955
Good work.

324
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:12,929
Elisa.

325
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:15,664
What are you doing in there?

326
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:19,369
Cleaning, huh?

327
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:21,768
Listen, honey.

328
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,537
Mr. "I pee with my hands
on my hips"

329
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,107
wants to see us both.

330
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,908
<i>"Zelda D. Fuller."</i>

331
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,811
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

332
00:26:30,813 --> 00:26:32,681
About 10 years, sir.

333
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,315
No siblings, Zelda?

334
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:37,316
No, sir.

335
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:39,988
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

336
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:43,125
My mama died after me.

337
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:45,527
After I was born.

338
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:49,565
What does that "D" stand for?

339
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:53,667
Delilah, sir.

340
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:55,002
On account of the Bible.

341
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:57,303
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

342
00:26:57,305 --> 00:27:01,108
Lulled him to sleep,
cut his hair.

343
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,076
Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him...

344
00:27:04,078 --> 00:27:06,014
burned his eyes out.

345
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,050
Guess my mama didn't read
the good book close enough.

346
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:11,254
And you...

347
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,188
"Elisa Esposito."

348
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,358
Doesn't "Esposito"
mean orphan?

349
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,092
"Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam."

350
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:22,463
They found her by the river

351
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:24,000
in the water.

352
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:28,004
It was you
that found my fingers.

353
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:31,237
Oh!

354
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,639
Thanks.

355
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:34,240
Three hours in surgery.

356
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:37,544
They rebuilt
the first phalanx here...

357
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:38,946
sutured the tendons.

358
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,717
Don't know if
it's gonna take or not.

359
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:44,851
There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?

360
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:46,486
It was all we had, sir.

361
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:49,556
I answer mostly on account
that she can't talk.

362
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:51,493
She can't? She deaf?

363
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:54,063
Mute, sir.

364
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:56,365
She said she can hear you.

365
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,237
All those scars on your neck.

366
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,709
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

367
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:09,877
She said since she was a baby.

368
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:12,211
Who would do that to a baby?

369
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:14,413
The world is sinful.

370
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:16,216
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

371
00:28:16,218 --> 00:28:18,187
Well, let me say this upfront.

372
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:22,255
You clean that lab,
you get out.

373
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:25,258
The thing we keep in there
is an affront.

374
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,861
Do you know what
an affront is, Zelda?

375
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,530
Something offensive.

376
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,264
That's right,
and I should know.

377
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:35,101
I dragged that filthy thing...

378
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:37,638
out of the river muck
in South America

379
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,142
all the way here.

380
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:41,140
And along the way,

381
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:43,142
we didn't get
to like each other much.

382
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:46,746
Now...

383
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,187
you may think that thing
looks human.

384
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:54,120
Stands on two legs, right?

385
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:57,259
But we're created
in the Lord's image.

386
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:00,660
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

387
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:04,198
I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.

388
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,135
Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

389
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:10,236
Or even you.

390
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:12,441
Maybe a little more like me,
I guess.

391
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:17,145
That's all.

392
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:22,349
General Hoyt, thank you
for calling me back, sir.

393
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,618
<i>- Feeling better?</i>
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.

394
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,852
Pain pills is all.

395
00:29:25,854 --> 00:29:27,321
- Close the door.
<i>- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>

396
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:29,389
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

397
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:30,824
But I still got my thumb,

398
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:32,092
my trigger,
and my pussy finger.

399
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:33,927
<i>Sounds to me
like you'll do all right then.</i>

400
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:36,129
Yes, sir, that's right.

401
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:38,130
Looking forward
to your visit, sir.

402
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:40,734
Decisions need to be made
about the asset.

403

406
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:24,777

<i>Pumpkin, banana...</i>

408
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:27,880
Pick me up at 9:30.

409
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:29,818
2130 hours. Yes, sir.

410
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,719
<i>That's-a-great-a-pie.</i>

411
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:34,854
I'm home.

412
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:37,590
I made you an omelet.

413
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:39,626
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

414
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:41,328
I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddles.

415
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,563
- Guess what?
- I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.

416
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:44,630
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

417
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:47,100
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

418
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:48,368
What?

419
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,138
We're burying a time capsule
at the new school.

420
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,706
I wanted to ask you...

421
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:56,075
Do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?

422
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:57,544
Believe it, son.

423
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:58,680
Oh! Bus is here.

424
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:01,784
This is America.

425
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,520
Bye, Dad!

426
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:09,555
Finish your omelet,

427
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:10,990
then wash your hands
real good...

428
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:12,659
and come upstairs, sweetie.

429
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:15,695
I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

430
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:18,434
Plus DC is just half
an hour away, isn't it?

431
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:23,438
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

432
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,843
You know what I'm thinking?

433
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:32,614
I'm thinking I need a new car.

434
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:41,224
You need a new car, do you?

435
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:45,427
How about a Cadillac, mister?

436
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:47,194

437
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,230

Sweetie, your, um,
your hand is bleeding.

440
00:31:57,873 --> 00:31:59,105
Silence. Don't talk.

441
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:00,974

00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,708
Fleming, I have to
finish some things in here.

484
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,810
Fetch the general, will you?

485
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,395
Aww, you missed me, huh?

486
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,332
I took a candy break.

487
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:16,636
This is what scares you, huh?

488
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:18,318
Well, gee, you should
be used to it by now.

489
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:24,109
There you go again,
making that god-awful sound.

490
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:27,114
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

491
00:40:27,116 --> 00:40:28,217
Are you hurting?

492
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:32,083
Or maybe you're angry!

493
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:34,323
Maybe you'd like to get
another bite of me.

494
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:36,154
Go ahead.

495
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,828
I can't tell.

496
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,196
I mean, are you begging?

497
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:45,464
Because to me,

498
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:48,533
it's just the worst fucking
noise I ever heard.

499
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,196
<i>Paging Captain Walters.</i>

500
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:20,333
<i>Captain Walters, please
pick up the courtesy call.</i>

501
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,403
Elisa.

502
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:23,337
Elisa!

503
00:41:34,582 --> 00:41:36,915
General Hoyt!
Welcome, sir!

504
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,884
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.

505
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:40,719
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

506
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:43,254
Good God Almighty!
Is that it?

507
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:44,857
Hell of a lot bigger
than I thought.

508
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,391
Ugly as sin.

509
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:49,962
You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshiped it like a god.

510
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:53,031
Doesn't look like
much of a god now, does it?

511
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:54,500
Well, they're primitive, sir.

512
00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:56,502
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

513
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:58,437
Flowers, fruits,
crap like that.

514
00:41:58,439 --> 00:42:00,406
Then they tried
to stop the oil drill

515
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:01,708
with bows and arrows.

516
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,076
That didn't turn out too well.

517
00:42:03,078 --> 00:42:05,013
He's bleeding.

518
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:07,346
What happened?

519
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:09,348
It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

520
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:13,018
"Oxygen osmosis
and dioxide exchange."

521
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,587
What the hell
have we got here, son?

522
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:15,721
This creature, sir...

523
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:17,156
it can alternate between two

524
00:42:17,158 --> 00:42:19,058
entirely separate
breathing mechanisms.

525
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,393
- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.

526
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:22,995
Look.

527
00:42:22,997 --> 00:42:24,864
You want to put
a man in space.

528
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:26,433
He's gonna have
to endure conditions

529
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:28,868
the human body
just wasn't made for.

530
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,705
This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.

531
00:42:31,707 --> 00:42:33,739
How long can it breathe
outside the water?

532
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,908
The reality is, sir,

533
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,612
we don't know jack shit
about this thing.

534
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:41,880
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

535
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:43,482
Those cockeyed bastards.

536
00:42:43,484 --> 00:42:46,419
You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space,

537
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:47,487
and we get a good laugh.

538
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,788
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,

539
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,924
a Russki,

540
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:53,359
orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what.

541
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:56,395
Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.

542
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:59,265
Let him send a dog up into space,
and he laughs.

543
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:01,734
Then he puts a commie
up in space, and he laughs.

544
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:04,105
And then he puts
missiles into Cuba.

545
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:06,071
Have we learned nothing?

546
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:08,007
Sir, we need to
get him back in the water.

547
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:10,176
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.

548
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:11,844
They fall in love
with their plaything.

549
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:13,379
Now, right here, see?

550
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:14,614
Along the middle.

551
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:17,016
This creature has
a thick-jointed cartilage

552
00:43:17,018 --> 00:43:19,652
that separates the primary
and secondary lungs.

553
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:20,853
Am I explaining
this correctly, Bob?

554
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:21,953
Yes, but we have...

555
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:24,757
It makes the X-rays
inconclusive.

556
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,091
In principle, sir, yes. But...

557
00:43:26,093 --> 00:43:28,027
Now, I believe if we want to
get an edge on the Soviets

558
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:30,096
we need to vivisect
this thing.

559
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:31,062
- No, no.
- Take it apart,

560
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:32,165
- learn how it works.
- No.

561
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,169
No! That would
defeat the purpose.

562
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,372
Sir, he's passed out.
Please.

563
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:39,438
Put him in the tank.

564
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,609
Let him pressurize.

565
00:43:41,475 --> 00:43:42,944
General Hoyt, sir?

566
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:46,946
You cannot,
under any circumstance,

567
00:43:46,948 --> 00:43:48,150
kill this creature.

568
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:55,187
Count these stars
with me, son.

569
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:56,589
There are five of them.

570
00:43:56,591 --> 00:43:58,924
Means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

571
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:00,192
Now, you want
to plead your case,

572
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:01,460
I'll listen to it.

573
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:05,098
But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

574
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:53,212
So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,

575
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:55,248
and close up shop here.

576
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,650
Give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

577
00:44:57,652 --> 00:44:58,784
You've done it.

578
00:44:58,786 --> 00:44:59,919
Thank you, sir.

579
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:02,054
Now, hurry up
and finish the job, son.

580
00:45:02,056 --> 00:45:03,658
Absolutely, sir.

581
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:06,759
<i>Get him out?</i>

582
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:08,694
What are you talking about?

583
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:10,698
No. Absolutely not.

584
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,866
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

585
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:16,138
We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.

586
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:19,774
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

587
00:45:20,642 --> 00:45:22,074
Does this mean that whenever

588
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:23,375
we go to
a Chinese restaurant

589
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:26,478
you wanna save
every fish in the tank?

590
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,450
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

591
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:33,185
The loneliest thing
you've ever seen?

592
00:45:33,187 --> 00:45:35,087
Well, you just said it right there.
You just said it!

593
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:37,091
You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.

594
00:45:38,893 --> 00:45:40,062
I can understand you.

595
00:45:43,797 --> 00:45:45,734
Calm down. God, calm down.

596
00:45:46,768 --> 00:45:48,336
All right,
I will repeat it to you.

597
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,444
"What am I?

598
00:46:00,147 --> 00:46:03,184
"I move my mouth, like him.

599
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:07,587
"I make no sound, like him.

600
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,860
"What does that make me?

601
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:16,361
"All that I am...

602
00:46:16,363 --> 00:46:18,830
"all that I've ever been...

603
00:46:18,832 --> 00:46:21,567
"brought me here, to him."

604
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,605
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

605
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:27,640
You just hit me!

606
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:29,107
Elisa, let go of me.

607
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:30,342
I'm looking. I'm looking!

608
00:46:30,344 --> 00:46:32,545
You've never hit me.

609
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:41,389
"When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me...

610
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:46,293
"He does not know
what I lack...

611
00:46:47,462 --> 00:46:49,264
"or how...

612
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:52,167
"I am incomplete.

613
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,669
"He sees me...

614
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,205
"for what I am...

615
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:00,709
"as I am.

616
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:05,447
"He's happy...

617
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,384
"to see me, every time...

618
00:47:10,116 --> 00:47:11,519
"every day.

619
00:47:12,986 --> 00:47:16,423
"And now I can either...

620
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:18,627
"save him...

621
00:47:24,165 --> 00:47:25,400
or let him die."

622
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:30,236
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

623
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:33,205
Elisa, no. I have to leave.

624
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:34,607
Just... Elisa, please stop.

625
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:36,241
Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

626
00:47:36,243 --> 00:47:38,109
I have to go.

627
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:40,279
I'm leaving now
because, Elisa,

628
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:41,413
this is very important to me.

629
00:47:41,415 --> 00:47:43,015
This is a second
chance for me.

630
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:45,183
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

631
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:46,752
Oh, God.

632
00:47:46,754 --> 00:47:48,020
When I come back,
we just will not talk

633
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:49,654
about this ever again.

634
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:51,190
Elisa, there's...

635
00:47:51,192 --> 00:47:52,257
All right!

636
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,694
What are we?
What are you and I?

637
00:47:55,696 --> 00:47:57,763
Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!

638
00:47:57,765 --> 00:47:59,598
Nothing! We can do nothing!

639
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,435
I'm sorry, but this...
this is just...

640
00:48:03,437 --> 00:48:05,606
Oh, God, it's not
even human. God!

641
00:48:10,578 --> 00:48:11,880
What?

642
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,731
Giles.

643
00:48:35,136 --> 00:48:36,803
- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.

644
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:37,806
It's okay.

645
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,242
We going in?

646
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:42,908
You should have
just mailed the art.

647
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,875
No.

648
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:46,745
I want to show it to you
and the team in person.

649
00:48:46,747 --> 00:48:48,714
I think it's some
of my best work.

650
00:48:48,716 --> 00:48:51,484
And it's green as can be.

651
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:55,522
It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.

652
00:48:57,991 --> 00:48:59,757
Oh. Well, sure.

653
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:00,928
No problem.

654
00:49:02,863 --> 00:49:05,767
What would be a good time
for you, Bernie?

655
00:49:13,473 --> 00:49:15,475
You painted that?

656
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:16,775
Yeah.

657
00:49:16,777 --> 00:49:18,576
Wowee!

658
00:49:18,578 --> 00:49:19,844
You're good.

659
00:49:19,846 --> 00:49:22,313
Apparently, not as good
as a photograph.

660
00:49:23,618 --> 00:49:25,884
But it is good, isn't it?

661
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:27,886
I couldn't paint
anything like that.

662
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:30,221
Here. On me.

663
00:49:30,223 --> 00:49:31,390
For me?

664
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:32,891
Well, we don't get
many like you in here.

665
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:36,031
You seem very educated,
and I like talking to you.

666
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:40,433
The thing is that's...

667
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,902
the only reason
that I come in here is...

668
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:44,770
- The conversation.
- And?

669
00:49:44,772 --> 00:49:46,871
The pie is mighty fine,
too, isn't it?

670
00:49:46,873 --> 00:49:47,875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,446
It's no key lime,
but it's good.

672
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:57,482
You know, I work alone...

673
00:49:57,484 --> 00:50:01,920
and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

674
00:50:01,922 --> 00:50:03,621
You see, that's part
of doing the job here.

675
00:50:03,623 --> 00:50:05,723
It's like being a bartender.

676
00:50:05,725 --> 00:50:07,826
You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.

677
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,397
You get to know them.

678
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:13,866
I'd like to get
to know you better.

679
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:15,433
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

680
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:17,703
- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

681
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:18,569
Hey, no, no, no.

682
00:50:18,571 --> 00:50:20,105
Not the counter.
Takeout only.

683
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:21,373
You can't sit there.

684
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:22,975
If you want something,
you order, you take it out.

685
00:50:22,977 --> 00:50:25,411
But it's empty.
The... the counter's empty.

686
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:28,016
All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.

687
00:50:30,852 --> 00:50:33,388
Y'all come back now, you hear?

688
00:50:34,388 --> 00:50:35,988
You don't need
to talk to them like that.

689
00:50:37,357 --> 00:50:39,591
You should go, too.

690
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:42,529
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

691
00:50:53,073 --> 00:50:55,574
<i>♪ So come back to my arms ♪</i>

692
00:50:57,011 --> 00:51:00,949
<i>♪ And show me
how wrong I can be ♪</i>

693
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,049
I have no one.

694
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:06,587
And you are the only person
that I can talk to.

695
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:10,658
Now, whatever this thing is...

696
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,893
you need it.

697
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:16,027
So...

698
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:18,063
you just tell me
what to do.

699
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,272
<i>♪ So come back to my arms ♪</i>

700
00:51:27,274 --> 00:51:30,107
<i>♪ And show me ♪</i>

701
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:36,547
<i>♪ How wrong I can be ♪</i>

702
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:39,719
- "All hope fades."
- "As the spring recedes."

703
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,755
Let's go.

704
00:53:20,587 --> 00:53:23,989
<i>♪ There's a summer place ♪</i>

705
00:53:27,294 --> 00:53:31,696
<i>♪ Where it may rain or storm ♪</i>

706
00:53:31,698 --> 00:53:35,936
<i>♪ Yet I'm safe and warm ♪</i>

707
00:53:37,872 --> 00:53:40,705
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

708
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:44,743
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

709
00:53:44,745 --> 00:53:46,377
I'm just idling around.

710
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:47,812
And I'm just talking.

711
00:53:47,814 --> 00:53:49,614
AM radio, air conditioner,

712
00:53:49,616 --> 00:53:53,585
power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.

713
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:55,587
All deluxe interior
appointment choices,

714
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:57,121
143 options.

715
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:58,857
Now, this...

716
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:01,659
- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.

717
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:03,261
I'm not sure about the green.

718
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,663
It's not green,
my friend. Teal.

719
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:06,797
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

720
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:09,000
It's a limited edition,
12 coats of paint...

721
00:54:09,002 --> 00:54:10,301
polished by hand,

722
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:12,404
all authentic
chrome detailing.

723
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:14,306
Four out of five
successful men in America

724
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:15,473
drive a Cadillac.

725
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:16,607
That a fact?

726
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:17,808
This here is the future.

727
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,245
And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.

728
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:21,946
- Where?
- Why, the future.

729
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:25,152
You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

730
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:21,005
Wow!

731
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:23,410
Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!

732
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:25,944
What can I say?

733
00:55:25,946 --> 00:55:27,748
You gotta feel good
driving that, huh?

734
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:31,315
And what a wonderful
shade of green, huh?

735
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:32,884
Teal.

736
00:55:32,886 --> 00:55:34,055
Teal.

737
00:55:42,696 --> 00:55:45,096
Tomorrow, I'll make
a mean meatloaf.

738
00:55:45,098 --> 00:55:46,098
Mmm-hmm.

739
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,770
Just for you, extra raisins.

740
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:15,861
So, at 5:00 AM,
I drive my car

741
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:17,096
down the loading ramp.

742
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:19,431
And the shifts are changing,
and I have...

743
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,400
How much time do I have?

744
00:56:21,402 --> 00:56:23,000
Five minutes? I'll remember.

745
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:25,437
5:00 AM, five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.

746
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:27,940
So, you're going
to move the cameras, right?

747
00:56:27,942 --> 00:56:30,007
And I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watches

748
00:56:30,009 --> 00:56:31,909
just like they do
in the movies.

749
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:34,580
Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.

750
00:56:34,582 --> 00:56:36,917
God! You're not afraid!

751
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:40,786
You are? Very?

752
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:43,589
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

753
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:50,295
I think this is some
of my best work.

754
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,663
"Michael Parker." I think
it's a good, trustworthy name.

755
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:53,799
It's a little butch.

756
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:55,870
Yes, age 51.

757
00:56:57,103 --> 00:56:58,105
54?

758
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,843
You don't have to be rude.

759
00:57:03,176 --> 00:57:04,511
57.

760
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,645
If I put the hair on,

761
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,246
I can pull it off.
I can wear this...

762
00:57:08,248 --> 00:57:09,214
or I have...

763
00:57:09,216 --> 00:57:11,917
Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!

764
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:13,051
Or I have this.

765
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:15,353
Now this, I think it says
"working man."

766
00:57:15,355 --> 00:57:17,924
But this, now this says...

767
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,926
this says with
the butterscotch tie...

768
00:57:20,928 --> 00:57:24,629
This says "casual,
but still stylish."

769
00:57:24,631 --> 00:57:27,632
So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.

770
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,067
I think we're ready.

771
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:51,690
Mr. Strickland!

772
00:57:51,692 --> 00:57:53,424
Sally, could you call
Miss Esposito

773
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,162
to clean up a spill?

774
00:57:58,632 --> 00:58:01,732
You know,
I can't figure it out myself.

775
00:58:01,734 --> 00:58:03,303
You're not much to look at...

776
00:58:04,471 --> 00:58:05,804
but go figure.

777
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:07,873
I keep thinking about you.

778
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,875
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent...

779
00:58:10,877 --> 00:58:12,946
or do you squawk a little?

780
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:16,681
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...

781
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:18,018
Hmm?

782
00:58:20,587 --> 00:58:22,590
I just want you to know...

783
00:58:24,392 --> 00:58:26,290
I don't mind those scars.

784
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:29,127
I don't mind that
you can't speak, either.

785
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:31,565
When you come
right down to it...

786
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:34,035
I like it.

787
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:36,369
A lot.

788
00:58:37,571 --> 00:58:39,306
It kind of gets me going.

789
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,482
I bet I can make you
squawk a little.

790
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:23,584
Hey, honey. You okay?

791
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:26,784
Hurry up.
I wanna be home early.

792
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:28,321
My feet are killing me.

793
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,050
We need to delay
the procedure.

794
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,717
Knock before
you enter my office.

795
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:00,988
This is urgent!

796
01:00:01,756 --> 01:00:03,321
Go back out, knock,

797
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:04,522
then I'll let you in
and we'll talk.

798
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:07,193
That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

799
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,500
Come in.

800
01:00:14,502 --> 01:00:16,337
Would you get the door
for me, please?

801
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:24,442
See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.

802
01:00:24,444 --> 01:00:25,976
I need more time.

803
01:00:25,978 --> 01:00:27,980
Don't let the fact
that you feel like a loser

804
01:00:27,982 --> 01:00:30,248
now that you've let your
competitive tendencies...

805
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,884
I'm not competitive!
I don't want an intricate,

806
01:00:32,886 --> 01:00:34,321
beautiful thing destroyed!

807
01:00:38,658 --> 01:00:40,292
This thing dies...

808
01:00:40,294 --> 01:00:43,062
you learn, I leave,
out of here.

809
01:00:43,064 --> 01:00:45,029
I settle down.

810
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:47,833
My family settles down
somewhere nice.

811
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:49,503
<i>A real city.</i>

812
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,109
This creature
is intelligent...

813
01:00:58,111 --> 01:01:00,044
capable of language...

814
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:02,482
of understanding emotions.

815
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,415
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

816
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:08,353
And we still kill them,
don't we?

817
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:11,054
The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zoo

818
01:01:11,056 --> 01:01:13,491
and I don't wanna be
in this shit hole

819
01:01:13,493 --> 01:01:15,025
any longer than need be.

820
01:01:15,027 --> 01:01:16,529
Do you?

821
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:20,568
Bob. Do you?

822
01:01:22,435 --> 01:01:24,004
No, I don't.

823
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:47,094
Hey, what are you waiting for?

824
01:01:47,828 --> 01:01:49,694
Have you seen Elisa?

825
01:01:49,696 --> 01:01:51,364
Come on, Zelda!

826
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:07,178
Did you move
the camera on the loading dock?

827
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,813
Is that where
you're taking him?

828
01:02:08,815 --> 01:02:10,281
Through the service tunnels?

829
01:02:10,283 --> 01:02:12,185
That's very smart.

830
01:02:12,819 --> 01:02:14,752
Who do you work for?

831
01:02:33,473 --> 01:02:36,975
His water must be kept
at 5 to 8% salinity.

832
01:02:36,977 --> 01:02:38,544
Table salt will do.

833
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:42,515
Mix one of these in his water
every three days.

834
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:46,551
Raw protein diet is a must.

835
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,219
In five minutes...

836
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,754
<i>I'll meet you
at the loading dock.</i>

837
01:02:49,756 --> 01:02:51,188
<i>The lights will go out...</i>

838
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,759
<i>so be prepared.</i>

839
01:03:12,277 --> 01:03:14,045
Mr. Strickland, sir?

840
01:03:14,047 --> 01:03:16,413
Twelve hours to
the vivisection of the asset.

841
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:18,818
And I need your signature
here, please.

842
01:03:22,723 --> 01:03:25,022
<i>...this
sudden, clandestine decision</i>

843
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:26,525
<i>to station strategic weapons</i>

844
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:29,196
<i>for the first time
outside of Soviet soil...</i>

845
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,397
Hold it right there.

846
01:03:32,399 --> 01:03:34,734
<i>...an unjustified change
in the status quo...</i>

847
01:03:53,218 --> 01:03:55,319
"Michael Parker." Is that you?

848
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:56,790
My whole life.

849
01:04:14,073 --> 01:04:15,575
Are you out of your mind?

850
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:21,247
Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!

851
01:04:26,419 --> 01:04:28,719
What's that?
What's that vehicle?

852
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:32,589
Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?

853
01:04:32,591 --> 01:04:34,627
But it's not scheduled.

854
01:04:39,332 --> 01:04:40,765
<i>And finally,</i>

855
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:42,833
<i>I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev</i>

856
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:44,471
<i>to halt and eliminate...</i>

857
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,304
<i>this clandestine, reckless,</i>

858
01:04:47,306 --> 01:04:49,540
<i>and provocative threat
to world peace</i>

859
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:52,379
<i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>

860
01:04:58,484 --> 01:04:59,317
Sir?

861
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:02,120
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

862
01:05:02,122 --> 01:05:03,962
- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.

863
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:08,926
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

864
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:10,495
Oh, God. I'm not good at this.

865
01:05:10,497 --> 01:05:12,630
Out of the vehicle now.
I will not say it again.

866
01:05:12,632 --> 01:05:14,498
- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!

867
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,740
Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.

868
01:05:25,779 --> 01:05:27,948
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

869
01:05:29,616 --> 01:05:30,651
Get out now!

870
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:34,486
You have to go. Hurry!

871
01:05:34,488 --> 01:05:36,987
Oh, woman,
we're gonna burn in hell.

872
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:38,223
Come on, push.

873
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,627
Push!

874
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,627
I swear, I'm not
doing this on purpose!

875
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:45,832
Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!

876
01:05:49,868 --> 01:05:50,868
What the...

877
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,237
She's waiting for you
at the dock. Go! Now!

878
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:10,661
Who's that man? I think
he just killed someone.

879
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:14,928
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

880
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:31,812
Are we ready,
are we ready?

881
01:06:38,218 --> 01:06:39,986
He's so beautiful.

882
01:06:48,696 --> 01:06:49,697
Did I do that?

883
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:53,734
I'm just not good at this.

884
01:06:54,968 --> 01:06:56,368
Move! Move!

885
01:07:38,745 --> 01:07:40,714
Come on. No.

886
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:46,519
No!

887
01:08:07,506 --> 01:08:09,909
Salt? What are you
talking about, salt?

888
01:08:12,312 --> 01:08:13,580
Elisa!

889
01:09:04,163 --> 01:09:05,165
There.

890
01:09:22,983 --> 01:09:24,084
Israeli Popper.

891
01:09:26,252 --> 01:09:28,188
You can smell the magnesium.

892
01:09:29,621 --> 01:09:30,954
Russians hate the Jews,

893
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:33,526
but they can't get enough
of their gadgets.

894
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:36,627
How'd they get in here?

895
01:09:36,629 --> 01:09:39,563
Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.

896
01:09:39,565 --> 01:09:43,234
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.

897
01:09:43,236 --> 01:09:44,401
Well, no one has to know.

898
01:09:44,403 --> 01:09:46,137
We got 24 hours
before I bounce it up.

899
01:09:46,139 --> 01:09:48,071
No, I called it in.

900
01:09:48,073 --> 01:09:49,207
You called it in?

901
01:09:49,209 --> 01:09:50,743
The moment it happened, I...

902
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:52,979
Mr. Strickland, sir.

903
01:09:54,514 --> 01:09:55,780
What is it, Sally?

904
01:09:55,782 --> 01:09:58,450
Sir, General Hoyt
is on the phone.

905
01:09:58,452 --> 01:10:01,218
<i>That thing was
our space dog, Strickland.</i>

906
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,352
<i>You know that.</i>

907
01:10:02,354 --> 01:10:04,187
Sir, I'm getting it back.

908
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:08,124
I can't be in a negative
frame of mind, sir.

909
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:09,494
<i>So, you're feeling good?</i>

910
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,695
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

911
01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:14,632
<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i>

912
01:10:14,634 --> 01:10:17,104
<i>For me, son. For me.</i>

913
01:10:58,344 --> 01:11:01,044
That's when you're
planning on releasing him?

914
01:11:01,046 --> 01:11:02,648
On the 10th?

915
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,749
So, what if the rains
are late?

916
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:07,219
What happens with the canal?

917
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:10,056
All right.

918
01:11:14,126 --> 01:11:15,595
What's that?

919
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:19,166
Let me see it.
Is that for me?

920
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:01,742
Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.

921
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:05,743
Looking like
you don't know anything.

922
01:12:05,745 --> 01:12:09,379
Lord help me,
if they ask me if I do.

923
01:12:09,381 --> 01:12:10,748
I'm not a good liar.

924
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,049
Except to Brewster.

925
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:14,718
It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.

926
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,119
<i>All personnel,</i>

927
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:18,688
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

928
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:22,293
Lord! What in the...

929
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:24,160
<i>Attention. All personnel,</i>

930
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:27,531
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

931
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:29,667
You done got us
in a world of trouble.

932
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:30,901
My opinion,
we're looking

933
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:32,570
at a highly-trained
group, sir.

934
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:34,338
I'm thinking,
conceivably, sir,

935
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,874
like special forces
or so on and so forth.

936
01:12:36,876 --> 01:12:38,609
Red Army Special Forces?

937
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:39,810
Conceivably.

938
01:12:39,812 --> 01:12:41,244
And they're highly trained.

939
01:12:41,246 --> 01:12:44,082
They were well-financed,
an elite group.

940
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:47,051
Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.

941
01:12:47,053 --> 01:12:48,985
Infiltration took less
than five minutes, sir.

942
01:12:48,987 --> 01:12:50,855
My conservative estimate
is that this was

943
01:12:50,857 --> 01:12:52,725
a strike force
of at least 10 men.

944
01:13:05,438 --> 01:13:07,306
<i>My master sends this dress.</i>

945
01:13:08,274 --> 01:13:10,076
Have you always been alone?

946
01:13:14,714 --> 01:13:16,349
Did you ever have someone?

947
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:20,084
Do you know what
happened to you? Do you?

948
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:22,255
Because I don't. I don't know
what happened to me.

949
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:25,021
I don't know.

950
01:13:25,023 --> 01:13:27,458
I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognize

951
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,029
are these eyes...

952
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:32,098
in this old man's face.

953
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:39,436
You know, sometimes I think
I was either born too early

954
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:40,806
or too late for my life.

955
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:47,277
Maybe we're both just relics.

956
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:49,313
<i>Security
measures have been increased</i>

957
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:50,513
<i>to maximum levels.</i>

958
01:13:50,515 --> 01:13:54,153
<i>Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

959
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:59,022
<i>Attention.</i>

960
01:13:59,024 --> 01:14:01,825
<i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>

961
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:03,960
Sir, I've got them.

962
01:14:03,962 --> 01:14:06,465
Zelda, Elisa. All right.

963
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:10,437
Here we go.

964
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:13,436
Mmm-hmm.

965
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:16,272
Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.

966
01:14:16,274 --> 01:14:18,042
Still.

967
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:20,576
If you know something
about what transpired here

968
01:14:20,578 --> 01:14:23,313
it's your obligation...

969
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:24,915
to report any detail,

970
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:27,951
no matter how small
or trivial it may seem.

971
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:30,154
"Trivial" means unimportant.

972
01:14:30,156 --> 01:14:34,191
I didn't see nothing
out of the ordinary, no.

973
01:14:34,193 --> 01:14:35,625
Or trivial.

974
01:14:35,627 --> 01:14:37,395
See, my feet were hurting.

975
01:14:37,397 --> 01:14:38,564
What about you?

976
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:42,568
She didn't see anything.

977
01:14:44,403 --> 01:14:45,504
Mmm.

978
01:14:52,344 --> 01:14:54,411
Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.

979
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:57,181
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

980
01:14:57,183 --> 01:14:59,150
He works there, doesn't he?

981
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:03,489
I mean in a different way,
doing something different.

982
01:15:04,889 --> 01:15:07,026
Something trivial?

983
01:15:07,593 --> 01:15:08,929
No, sir.

984
01:15:22,774 --> 01:15:27,279
What am I doing,
interviewing the fucking help?

985
01:15:28,648 --> 01:15:30,350
The shit cleaners.

986
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,219
The piss wipers.

987
01:15:36,554 --> 01:15:38,924
You two, go ahead. Leave.

988
01:15:43,929 --> 01:15:47,399
All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.

989
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:50,603
What'd you say to me?

990
01:15:55,442 --> 01:15:56,877
What is she saying?

991
01:15:58,644 --> 01:15:59,946
I didn't catch it.

992
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:02,111
What is she saying?

993
01:16:02,113 --> 01:16:04,617
She... she is saying thank you.

994
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:16,162
Next!

995
01:16:33,612 --> 01:16:38,115
<i>I didn't see you
last night or the night before.</i>

996
01:16:38,117 --> 01:16:39,549
<i>I'm sorry, Ed,</i>

997
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,218
<i>but now that I'm spending
all day long in the office,</i>

998
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,721
<i>Carol feels that I... I should
spend my evenings with her.</i>

999
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:46,557
<i>Well, if you
spend the evenings with her,</i>

1000
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:47,792
<i>when will I?</i>

1001
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,370
<i>There's only
one thing left to do.</i>

1002
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:00,570
<i>Volunteer.</i>

1003
01:17:29,535 --> 01:17:31,237
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1004
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:57,494
I wanna get home early.

1005
01:17:57,496 --> 01:18:00,600
Brewster's been in
a bad mood lately.

1006
01:18:03,536 --> 01:18:04,535
Holy Jesus!

1007
01:18:04,537 --> 01:18:06,203
What are you doin'
standing in the shadows

1008
01:18:06,205 --> 01:18:07,538
of the women's locker room?

1009
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,473
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.

1010
01:18:09,475 --> 01:18:10,508
For good reason.

1011
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:12,375
But have you caught us
at an inconvenient moment!

1012
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:14,210
I need to know
that he's alright.

1013
01:18:14,212 --> 01:18:16,280
- He is.
- When will you release him?

1014
01:18:16,282 --> 01:18:17,481
Soon.

1015
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:20,587
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

1016
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:25,588
If you need anything...

1017
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:27,160
Release him. Soon.

1018
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:32,361
What did she say?

1019
01:18:32,363 --> 01:18:35,035
She said you're a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.

1020
01:18:38,071 --> 01:18:39,738
My name is Dimitri.

1021
01:18:43,076 --> 01:18:44,544
Honored to meet you.

1022
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:48,646
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

1023
01:18:48,648 --> 01:18:50,513
It's urgent.

1024
01:18:56,089 --> 01:18:57,623
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

1025
01:18:58,623 --> 01:18:59,626
Believe me. I'm fine.

1026
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,058
He ate Pandora.

1027
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,460
Wasn't his fault.
He's a wild creature.

1028
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:06,762
We can't ask him
to be anything else.

1029
01:19:06,764 --> 01:19:08,565
Elisa, go find him.

1030
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:10,566
Go. Go.

1031
01:19:10,568 --> 01:19:11,901
Go!

1032
01:19:13,505 --> 01:19:14,605
You're lucky.

1033
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:18,505
Ow.

1034
01:20:19,904 --> 01:20:22,306
I stayed awake
as long as I could.

1035
01:20:22,308 --> 01:20:24,277
You know,
I'm not even mad anymore.

1036
01:20:25,044 --> 01:20:26,513
Is he all right?
You sure?

1037
01:20:29,815 --> 01:20:31,147
Where you going?

1038
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:32,618
No, no.

1039
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:34,517
Okay, don't... no, no.

1040
01:20:34,519 --> 01:20:35,985
Don't... don't play
with the kitties.

1041
01:20:35,987 --> 01:20:37,087
No, no.

1042
01:20:37,089 --> 01:20:38,722
Don't play with the kitties.

1043
01:20:38,724 --> 01:20:40,492
I'm not... I'm not angry.

1044
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:46,864
Oh, my!

1045
01:20:55,241 --> 01:20:56,473
You did that. It's okay.

1046
01:20:56,475 --> 01:20:58,178
It's... ooh. I don't
think that's sanitary.

1047
01:21:02,014 --> 01:21:03,550
Enough.

1048
01:21:06,919 --> 01:21:08,787
Oh, God.

1049
01:21:14,227 --> 01:21:15,761
Interesting guy.

1050
01:21:19,297 --> 01:21:20,731
<i>All personnel
prepare to present</i>

1051
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:22,932
<i>your identity
and clearance cards.</i>

1052
01:21:22,934 --> 01:21:24,469
You wanted to see me?

1053
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:29,271
How's it going?

1054
01:21:29,273 --> 01:21:31,208
The investigation?

1055
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:32,845
Well, we have
a promising lead.

1056
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:34,814
Really?

1057
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:38,283
That's good to hear.

1058
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,250
You joined us in Galveston,

1059
01:21:41,252 --> 01:21:43,253
but where were
you before, Hoffstetler?

1060
01:21:43,255 --> 01:21:44,888
- Doctor.
- Excuse me?

1061
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:46,826
Doctor Hoffstetler.

1062
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:50,395
Protocol.

1063
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:54,231
Wisconsin. Madison.

1064
01:21:54,233 --> 01:21:55,432
Oh that's right.

1065
01:21:55,434 --> 01:21:57,968
You gave up a tenure
track position, didn't you?

1066
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:01,608
Gave it all up for us.

1067
01:22:04,175 --> 01:22:05,776
I suppose...

1068
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:09,146
you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?

1069
01:22:09,148 --> 01:22:10,882
Only if the creature
isn't found.

1070
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:15,384
Well, what do you think?

1071
01:22:15,386 --> 01:22:16,619
You think we will find it?

1072
01:22:16,621 --> 01:22:19,024
Well, you said
you had a lead.

1073
01:22:20,192 --> 01:22:21,694
I do.

1074
01:25:11,996 --> 01:25:13,465
Why you smiling, hon?

1075
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:16,969
Stop looking like that.

1076
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,040
What happened?

1077
01:25:24,776 --> 01:25:25,978
Why?

1078
01:25:27,144 --> 01:25:28,613
How?

1079
01:25:29,648 --> 01:25:30,750
How?

1080
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,952
Does he have a...?

1081
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:41,460
Mm-hmm.

1082
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:44,162
Mm-hmm.

1083
01:25:51,702 --> 01:25:53,904
Oh!

1084
01:25:53,906 --> 01:25:55,972
Never trust a man.

1085
01:25:55,974 --> 01:25:58,307
Even when he looks
flat down there.

1086
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:19,759
Hmm.

1087
01:28:00,631 --> 01:28:03,665
<i>You rang?</i>

1088
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,636
<i>Oh, hi, Maynard. I
just signed up for anthropology.</i>

1089
01:28:06,638 --> 01:28:09,905
<i>We're gonna hold class in the
Amazon jungle in South America.</i>

1090
01:28:09,907 --> 01:28:11,841
<i>South America?
Ooh, man, Dob.</i>

1091
01:28:11,843 --> 01:28:13,576
<i>You're gonna have to get up awful early
in the morning. That's a long hike.</i>

1092
01:28:13,578 --> 01:28:15,477
<i>No, Maynard, we're gonna stay down there.</i>

1093
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:18,382
<i>- We are?
- Oh, no, you're not coming along, too.</i>

1094
01:28:18,384 --> 01:28:21,953
This is a gelatin parfait.

1095
01:28:22,587 --> 01:28:23,986
You're gonna love it.

1096
01:28:23,988 --> 01:28:25,155
Dad, can we watch <i>Bonanza?</i>

1097
01:28:25,157 --> 01:28:27,557
<i>Bonanza</i> is much too violent.

1098
01:28:27,559 --> 01:28:28,825
You know what
I was thinking today?

1099
01:28:28,827 --> 01:28:31,962
We get the kids
a P-U-P-P-Y.

1100
01:30:30,948 --> 01:30:32,816
Let's go. Come on.

1101
01:30:32,818 --> 01:30:34,053
Let's get out of here.

1102
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:21,964
What is going on?!

1103
01:31:21,966 --> 01:31:24,334
I've got water
pouring into my theater!

1104
01:31:24,336 --> 01:31:27,036
I have four paying customers!
I've got to offer refunds.

1105
01:31:27,038 --> 01:31:28,405
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

1106
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:30,367
- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.

1107
01:31:47,492 --> 01:31:50,029
Elisa?

1108
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:54,033
Dear God. Elisa!

1109
01:32:23,694 --> 01:32:25,531
I'm toweling my hair!

1110
01:32:26,465 --> 01:32:28,067
It's my hair.

1111
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:30,866
Ah, just...

1112
01:32:30,868 --> 01:32:32,401
Oh! Look at my arm.

1113
01:32:32,403 --> 01:32:34,637
The wound. It's like
it was never there.

1114
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,040
Look at that.

1115
01:32:36,707 --> 01:32:38,240
Now you said that...

1116
01:32:38,242 --> 01:32:39,508
you know, he was worshiped
like a god.

1117
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:41,078
Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.

1118
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,178
I mean, he ate a cat,
so I don't... I don't know.

1119
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,780
I don't know, but, I mean,

1120
01:32:44,782 --> 01:32:46,384
we have to keep him
around awhile.

1121
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:49,254
Little while.

1122
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:09,642
Hello?

1123
01:34:50,608 --> 01:34:51,743
<i>Your water, sir.</i>

1124
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:56,579
- And sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1125
01:34:56,581 --> 01:34:57,746
Tell him I'm not here.

1126
01:34:57,748 --> 01:34:59,914
Tell him I'll call him back.
Don't put him through.

1127
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:01,217
No, sir...

1128
01:35:01,219 --> 01:35:03,087
He... he's in your office.

1129
01:35:06,257 --> 01:35:09,325
At this point,
our only concern is the asset.

1130
01:35:09,327 --> 01:35:11,764
- Do you have it?
- Still in the winds, sir.

1131
01:35:12,863 --> 01:35:14,132
Well, that won't do.

1132
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,568
Yes, sir, I know.

1133
01:35:18,737 --> 01:35:21,170
You've known me
how long, sir?

1134
01:35:21,172 --> 01:35:23,472
Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.

1135
01:35:23,474 --> 01:35:25,208
Yes, sir.

1136
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:28,277
A man is faithful,
loyal, efficient all his life.

1137
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:30,847
All of it. And he is...

1138
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:31,815
useful.

1139
01:35:31,817 --> 01:35:34,420
And he expects...

1140
01:35:36,054 --> 01:35:38,757
He has certain
expectations in return.

1141
01:35:40,692 --> 01:35:43,226
And then, he fails once.

1142
01:35:43,228 --> 01:35:45,994
Only once.
What does that make him?

1143
01:35:45,996 --> 01:35:47,632
That make him a failure?

1144
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:53,602
When is a man done, sir?

1145
01:35:53,604 --> 01:35:55,771
Proving himself?

1146
01:35:55,773 --> 01:35:57,906
A good man?

1147
01:35:57,908 --> 01:35:59,611
A decent man?

1148
01:36:03,447 --> 01:36:05,084
"Decent?"

1149
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,388
A man has the decency
not to fuck up.

1150
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:15,124
Now that's one thing.

1151
01:36:15,126 --> 01:36:17,360
That's real decent of him.

1152
01:36:17,362 --> 01:36:20,096
But the other kind of decency?

1153
01:36:20,098 --> 01:36:21,231
It doesn't really matter.

1154
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:24,333
Well sell it,
but it's an export.

1155
01:36:24,335 --> 01:36:26,738
We sell it,
because we don't use it.

1156
01:36:28,072 --> 01:36:29,938
36 hours from now...

1157
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:33,745
this entire episode
will be over.

1158
01:36:35,613 --> 01:36:36,848
And so will you.

1159
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:41,584
Our universe
will have a hole in it

1160
01:36:41,586 --> 01:36:43,686
with your outline.

1161
01:36:43,688 --> 01:36:45,989
And you will have moved on

1162
01:36:45,991 --> 01:36:48,426
to an alternate universe.

1163
01:36:49,728 --> 01:36:51,497
A universe of shit.

1164
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:56,234
You'll be lost
to civilization.

1165
01:36:58,435 --> 01:37:01,305
And you will be unborn.

1166
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,675
Unmade.

1167
01:37:05,943 --> 01:37:07,513
And undone.

1168
01:37:14,118 --> 01:37:16,721
So go get some
real decency, son.

1169
01:37:17,855 --> 01:37:19,789
And unfuck this mess.

1170
01:37:55,693 --> 01:37:57,392
36 hours.

1171
01:37:57,394 --> 01:37:59,361
36 hours. Well, shit.

1172
01:37:59,363 --> 01:38:01,164
You deliver. You deliver,
that's what you do.

1173
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:03,232
You deliver! Right? Right?!

1174
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:57,989

if you don't know now.

1202
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:20,898
Elisa...

1203
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:24,770
What is it, honey?

1204
01:41:51,461 --> 01:41:53,063
This isn't good.

1205
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:57,769
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

1206
01:41:59,903 --> 01:42:01,772
We gotta release him
tonight, honey.

1207
01:42:02,439 --> 01:42:04,075
I'll come back and help you.

1208
01:42:28,498 --> 01:42:29,833
He's coming out.

1209
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,472
Ah, fuck.

1210
01:42:42,046 --> 01:42:44,413
Sir, if you don't
mind me saying, you...

1211
01:42:44,415 --> 01:42:45,783
you don't look so well.

1212
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:47,819
Shut up.

1213
01:42:50,153 --> 01:42:52,120
Can you smell that?
I mean...

1214
01:42:52,122 --> 01:42:54,223
I think it's your fingers.
They're... they're...

1215
01:42:54,225 --> 01:42:56,694
- Mmm.
- black.

1216
01:43:01,232 --> 01:43:03,066
There he is.

1217
01:43:03,068 --> 01:43:04,732
Doctor-fucking-shirtbird.

1218
01:43:04,734 --> 01:43:06,535
Oh, there's no cause
for cursing, sir.

1219
01:43:11,309 --> 01:43:13,278
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

1220
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:15,710
This is my car.

1221
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,245
Get the fuck out.

1222
01:43:17,247 --> 01:43:18,750
Out of my car?

1223
01:43:19,416 --> 01:43:21,018
Did I stutter?

1224
01:44:53,812 --> 01:44:55,244
Strickland! Thank God!

1225
01:44:55,246 --> 01:44:57,813
You were speaking Russian...

1226
01:44:57,815 --> 01:44:58,880
Bob.

1227
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,994
What's your name?

1228
01:45:11,996 --> 01:45:14,829
- Hoffstetler.
- No, no. Don't lie.

1229
01:45:14,831 --> 01:45:16,130
You don't need to.

1230
01:45:16,132 --> 01:45:19,067
You took a bullet to the gut.

1231
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:20,302
You're dead.

1232
01:45:20,304 --> 01:45:21,904
I need the names, ranks

1233
01:45:21,906 --> 01:45:24,272
and location
of the entire strike team.

1234
01:45:24,274 --> 01:45:25,941
"Strike team?"

1235
01:45:25,943 --> 01:45:28,844
The ones who took the asset!

1236
01:45:37,654 --> 01:45:41,056
This candy.
It's cheap candy, but I love it.

1237
01:45:41,058 --> 01:45:43,859
Ever since I was a kid.

1238
01:45:43,861 --> 01:45:47,128
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks,

1239
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:50,598
nougat center
and all that foo-foo shit.

1240
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,770
But not me, Bob!

1241
01:45:53,604 --> 01:45:54,939
This is it for me.

1242
01:45:57,808 --> 01:46:00,409
Now sometimes
if I'm feeling anxious,

1243
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:01,451
I just bite right into it.

1244
01:46:02,179 --> 01:46:04,146
But mostly,

1245
01:46:04,148 --> 01:46:05,849
I take my time.

1246
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,717
I make it last.

1247
01:46:13,023 --> 01:46:14,656
Names, ranks,

1248
01:46:14,658 --> 01:46:16,659
and location
of the strike team.

1249
01:46:20,363 --> 01:46:22,597
Names! Ranks! Now!

1250
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:28,773
No names.

1251
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:31,443
No ranks.

1252
01:46:32,276 --> 01:46:33,812
They...

1253
01:46:34,545 --> 01:46:35,843
They just clean.

1254
01:46:47,056 --> 01:46:49,258
Alright, Brewster,
I'm gonna fix your dinner,

1255
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,030
and then I'm gonna run out for a
little while and help a friend.

1256
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:54,730
Help with what?

1257
01:46:54,732 --> 01:46:56,265
Help a friend.

1258
01:46:58,602 --> 01:47:00,435
Zelda...

1259
01:47:00,437 --> 01:47:01,872
the door.

1260
01:47:05,309 --> 01:47:07,942
Well, you could help me
and answer the door, Brewster.

1261
01:47:07,944 --> 01:47:10,212
You're sitting right here
just ten feet away from it!

1262
01:47:10,214 --> 01:47:12,080
My back's aching me, woman.
Now, move!

1263
01:47:12,082 --> 01:47:14,352
Your back, your back?
Always your back!

1264
01:47:17,587 --> 01:47:18,956
Mr. Strickland.

1265
01:47:19,689 --> 01:47:21,490
What are you doing here?

1266
01:47:21,492 --> 01:47:22,825
Who's that man, Zelda?

1267
01:47:22,827 --> 01:47:24,125
Where is it?

1268
01:47:24,127 --> 01:47:25,660
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

1269
01:47:25,662 --> 01:47:28,182
- What are you talking about? I... I don't...
- Zelda!

1270
01:47:29,767 --> 01:47:32,836
The thing in the lab.

1271
01:47:34,138 --> 01:47:35,070
Where is it?

1272
01:47:35,072 --> 01:47:37,208
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1273
01:47:46,617 --> 01:47:47,749
I'm sorry, sir.

1274
01:47:47,751 --> 01:47:50,187
If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1275
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:56,795
That story about Samson.

1276
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,895
I never told you how it ends.

1277
01:47:59,897 --> 01:48:04,469
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

1278
01:48:05,903 --> 01:48:09,107
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1279
01:48:10,808 --> 01:48:13,909
And at the last minute,
he is spared.

1280
01:48:13,911 --> 01:48:18,681
And the Lord gives him
his strength back...

1281
01:48:18,683 --> 01:48:20,051
one last time.

1282
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:25,223
And he holds...

1283
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:29,458
the columns of the temple...

1284
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,926
with his powerful arms.

1285
01:48:30,928 --> 01:48:33,832
And he crushes them.

1286
01:48:45,309 --> 01:48:47,008
And he brings
the whole building

1287
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:49,112
down on the Philistines.

1288
01:48:54,551 --> 01:48:56,051
He dies...

1289
01:48:56,053 --> 01:49:00,358
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1290
01:49:00,957 --> 01:49:02,326
That is his will!

1291
01:49:06,296 --> 01:49:11,068
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

1292
01:49:12,002 --> 01:49:14,503
for us, Delilah?

1293
01:49:14,505 --> 01:49:16,972
It means if you know something
you're not telling me

1294
01:49:16,974 --> 01:49:18,941
you're gonna tell me

1295
01:49:18,943 --> 01:49:23,044
either before or after

1296
01:49:23,046 --> 01:49:25,450
I bring
this particular temple...

1297
01:49:26,783 --> 01:49:30,485
down upon our heads.

1298
01:49:30,487 --> 01:49:32,920
Gal stole that
thing right out the lab,

1299
01:49:32,922 --> 01:49:34,489
whatever it is.

1300
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:36,857
Mute girl took it.

1301
01:49:36,859 --> 01:49:39,663
I heard my wife talking
on the phone about it.

1302
01:49:44,167 --> 01:49:46,468
Thank you very much,
Mr. Fuller,

1303
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:48,272
for your assistance.

1304
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:01,217
What have you done?

1305
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:02,017
Zelda.

1306
01:50:02,019 --> 01:50:03,151
I gotta warn her.

1307
01:50:03,153 --> 01:50:04,852
He's going after her.

1308
01:50:04,854 --> 01:50:07,054
You will do
no such thing, woman.

1309
01:50:07,056 --> 01:50:08,390
Why are you worrying about her?

1310
01:50:08,392 --> 01:50:09,790
She broke the law.

1311
01:50:09,792 --> 01:50:11,962
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

1312
01:50:12,662 --> 01:50:14,564
Years, you don't talk...

1313
01:50:15,933 --> 01:50:18,834
and now you can't
shut your mouth!

1314
01:50:18,836 --> 01:50:20,204
Damn you, Brewster.

1315
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,440
You wouldn't understand.

1316
01:50:24,442 --> 01:50:28,910
Couldn't understand, not if
you tried your whole life.

1317
01:50:28,912 --> 01:50:31,045
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Giles, is that you?

1318
01:50:31,047 --> 01:50:33,050
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Okay. Put Elisa on the phone.

1319
01:50:33,651 --> 01:50:34,652
It's Zelda.

1320
01:50:36,353 --> 01:50:39,387
Elisa, honey, make a sound
on the phone if you can hear.

1321
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:41,591
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1322
01:50:42,259 --> 01:50:43,792
He's coming for you.

1323
01:50:43,794 --> 01:50:46,462
<i>You gotta go now, and you gotta
take that thing with you.</i>

1324
01:50:46,464 --> 01:50:47,564
What? Elisa?

1325
01:50:56,072 --> 01:50:58,675
Hey! Watch out!
Learn how to drive!

1326
01:51:28,706 --> 01:51:30,108
Damn it.

1327
01:51:41,685 --> 01:51:43,286
We have to go.

1328
01:51:45,656 --> 01:51:47,321
Where are you?

1329
01:51:47,323 --> 01:51:48,923
Where the fuck are you?

1330
01:54:12,569 --> 01:54:14,371
I do not fail.

1331
01:54:16,005 --> 01:54:17,440
I deliver.

1332
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:23,714
Elisa!

1333
01:54:24,915 --> 01:54:26,584
Elisa.

1334
01:54:35,393 --> 01:54:36,394
No.

1335
01:55:24,575 --> 01:55:25,675
Fuck.

1336
01:55:26,876 --> 01:55:28,511
You are a god.

1337
01:56:02,912 --> 01:56:04,281
Look, man on the ground.

1338
01:56:05,114 --> 01:56:06,550
Watch him.

1339
01:56:13,389 --> 01:56:15,725
You there! Call an ambulance!

1340
01:57:35,538 --> 01:57:37,438
<i>If I told you about her,</i>

1341
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,507
<i>what would I say?</i>

1342
01:57:39,509 --> 01:57:42,444
<i>That they lived
happily ever after?</i>

1343
01:57:42,446 --> 01:57:44,980
<i>I believe they did.</i>

1344
01:57:44,982 --> 01:57:48,984
<i>That they were in love,
that they remained in love?</i>

1345
01:57:48,986 --> 01:57:50,988
<i>I'm sure that's true.</i>

1346
01:57:51,755 --> 01:57:53,824
<i>But when I think of her...</i>

1347
01:57:54,759 --> 01:57:56,959
<i>of Elisa...</i>

1348
01:57:56,961 --> 01:57:59,927
<i>the only thing that comes
to mind is a poem</i>

1349

hundreds of years ago.</i>
