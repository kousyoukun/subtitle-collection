1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
索唱

2
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,960
水 形 物 語

3
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,750
關於她的故事
If I spoke about it.

4
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,990
如果要講的話
If I did.

5
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,000
我要怎麼說呢
What would I tell you?

6
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,020
我在想
I wonder.

7
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,270
故事發生在什麼時候呢？
Would I tell you about the time?

8
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,110
似乎 發生在很久以前了
It happened a long time ago- It seems...

9
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,530
那位王子當政的最後幾天
In the last days of a fair Prince's reign...

10
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,640
我們還是先來講講那個地方吧
Or would I tell you about the place?

11
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,320
那是一座小城 靠近海岸
A small city near the coast

12
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,060
與世隔絕
but far from everything else...

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,710
還能給你講點什麼呢
Or, I don't know.

14
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,760
要麼跟你講講她的故事吧
Would I tell you about her?

15
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,310
公主無法說話
The princess without voice

16
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,110
或許我該提醒你
Or perhaps I would just warn you

17
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,060
這些故事是真實的
about the truth of these facts

18
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,640
這是一個悲歡離合的故事
and the tale of love and loss

19
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,660
還有那個
and the monster

20
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,140
試圖摧毀一切的惡魔
that tried to destroy it all...

21
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,170
荷達克大人
My Lord Hedak.

22
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,890
你感到煩惱
So, you are troubled.

23
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,500
說出來吧
Tell me.

24
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,880
我
I have...

25
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,190
我有罪
I have sinned.

26
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,900
我觸犯了上帝
I've offended the god.

27
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,450
荷達克大人 我是個罪人
I'm deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.

28
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,290
我自有判斷
Let me judge of that.

29
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,010
我對祭祀儀式 有所懷疑
I've doubted the ceremony of the sacrifice.

30
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,350
警報聲把你吵醒了麼
Did the sirens wake you up?

31
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,800
那個巧克力工廠 著火了
It was a fire. The chocolate factory.

32
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,710
你聞到這味了麼 我的天
You smell that? Oh my...

33
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,580
烤熟的可可
Toasted cocoa.

34
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,190
塞翁失馬 焉知非福
Tragedy and delight-- Hand in hand.

35
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,760
要吃點什麼嗎？

36
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
親愛的
Oh dear child.

37
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,130
要是沒你在這照顧我 我就會日漸消瘦了
I'd waste away if you weren't here looking after me.

38
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,600
眾所周知 我可是很耐餓的 看這個
I am the proverbial starving. Watch this.

39
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,780
看著樓梯舞
Bojangles, the stair dance.

40
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,250
這舞蹈挺難學的
That's so hard.

41
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,170
卡格尼就做到了
Cagney did it. Different but beautiful.

42
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,830
太美了

43
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,160
我也想學這舞蹈
I want to do that too.

44
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,710
好呀 準備好了麼
All right. Are you ready?

45
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,050
- 好了 - 來吧
- Yep. - Come on.

46
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,490
艾麗莎
Elisa.

47
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,400
下次你來交房租的時候
Next time you're going to bring the rent,

48
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,520
我想讓你留下來看這部聖經主題的電影
I want you to stay and see the bible movie, huh.

49
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,480
我這...我這有兩張免費電影票
I got... I got two free tickets here.

50
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,030
把你的鄰居查爾斯也帶上 他是個好人
You bring your neighbor Charles. He's a good boy.

51
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,170
或者你要看喜劇片? 現在沒幾個人看電影了
Find a movie in comedy? Nobody's coming to the theater, huh.

52
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,260
謝謝

53
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,230
我會給你提供免費的爆米花和蘇打水的
I can throw you a free popcorn and soda.

54
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,010
哦不 我的天 那裏應該放兩個S啊
Oh no, for God's sake! There's two "S' there.

55
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,130
一個S是Mardi Gras 意思是狂歡節

56
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,130
快點 放兩個S
Come on. Two "S". Mardi Grass. Mardi Grass.

57
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,900
艾麗莎 快來 快點來
Elisa, come on. Come here already!

58
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,990
- 你要學會按時上班啊 - 嘿 你幹什麼呢
- You gotta learn to be on time. - Hey, what you doing?

59
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,480
- 就這麼讓她插隊麼 蠢貨 - 少管閒事
- Look her in, Dummy. - Leave her alone, woman.

60
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,620
我幫她排了隊的
I was keepin' her place.

61
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,140
我會檢舉你們的 我會來找你和這啞巴的麻煩的
I get reported. I come after you and the mute.

62
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,840
你去啊 尤蘭達
You do that, Yolanda.

63
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,330
你去啊
You do that.

64
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,700
我這腳 真是疼死我了
My feet are already killin' me.

65
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,620
我那天晚上走之前 給布魯斯特做了麵包熱狗卷
I made Brewster pigs in the blanket tonight before leavin'.

66
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
我的天 他就這麼吃完了
Boy, he just ate 'em up.

67
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,070
沒說謝謝 吃的時候也沒發出聲音
No thank-yous, no yum-yums, not a peep-

68
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,970
冷峻的就像一座墓碑那樣
Man is silent as the grave.

69
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,100
如果放屁聲是他對我的奉承
But if farts were flattery

70
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,700
那他簡直堪比文豪莎士比亞了
Honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

71
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,090
然後我回家 給他做早餐
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

72
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,740
雞蛋 培根 還有烤麵包片加黃油
Eggs, bacon and buttered toast.

73
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,600
我還要給烤麵包雙面都抹上黃油 艾麗莎 搞得就像他是我兒子一樣
I butter the man's toast, Elisa. Both sides-As if he was a child...

74
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,070
他甚至連一聲謝謝都不會說
And I don't even get a 「Thank You」

75
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,850
你懂的感恩 因為你是受過教育的
You'd be grateful, because you are an educated woman.

76
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,620
但是我家的那位嘛 身上只散發出一種野性的魅力
But my Brewster, all he had gone for him was animal magnetism back in the day

77
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,420
原來還挺吸引我的
And workin' awhile.

78
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,380
我的天
What in the same hell?

79
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,550
露！
Lou!

80
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,520
你們這幫小子介不介意把垃圾都丟到桶裏
You boys mind puttin' the trash in the can?

81
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,750
垃圾就應該丟到該丟的地方去
That's what it's that for.

82
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,600
真是難以置信 垃圾就應該丟到該丟的地方去
Hard to believe, uh? That's what it's that for.

83
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,670
- 好 好 抱歉 澤爾達 - 我不知道他們整天在幹什麼
- Alright. Alright. Sorry Zelda, sorry. - I don't know what they're doin'.

84
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,900
要我說 你們真是搞得一塌糊塗
Makin' a goddamn mess, in what I'd say.

85
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,110
- 澤爾達 別聊天了 - 是 長官
- Zelda, stop the chatting please. - Yes sir.

86
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,820
- 沒有必要說那些話 - 抱歉 弗萊明先生
- There's no call for the blaspheme. - Sorry, Mr. Fleming.

87
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,910
佔用各位一點時間
A moment of your time.

88
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,030
今天有一隊新的研究人員和研究對像要來到我們T-4設施
Today, we are receiving a new team and asset here in T-4.

89
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,420
這位是羅伯特·霍夫斯德勒 從加爾維斯頓調過來
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, from our system facility in Galveston.

90
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,620
我不是想虛張聲勢 誇大其詞什麼的
Now, I don't want to bolster or overstate the matter but uh

91
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,940
這個可能是目前這個設施裏
this may very well be the most sensitive asset

92
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
最重要的研究對象了
ever to be housed in this facility

93
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,790
- 旅途如何？- 還行
- How was your trip? - Fine.

94
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,290
- 安保人員在哪？- 請稍後
- Who's security here? - Just one moment please.

95
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,630
- 安保人員在哪？- 歡迎來到T-4設施 長官
Security. Who's security here? - Welcome to T-4, sir.

96
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,900
是 長官 我是弗蘭明 這裏的安保負責人
Yes, sir. I am Flemington, Head of Security...

97
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,880
把閒雜人趕出去
Get them out.

98
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,630
幫我把這圓柱箱推進壓縮機裏
Help me move the cylinder into the compressor!

99
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,190
搬過來 搬過來
Bring it here. Bring it here.

100
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,070
艾麗莎 艾麗莎 快走吧
Elisa! Elisa, come on.

101
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,730
那裏是什麼情況 你看到了麼？
What goes on in this place? Did you see that?

102
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,120
是的 我搞了些裝飾品 看起來怎麼樣
Yes, I'm wearing the hair piece. How's is it look like?

103
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,490
小心車
Careful of the car.

104
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,850
嚴格來說那不是什麼裝飾品 是假髮
It's not a hair piece. It's a toupee.

105
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,850
假髮是不會脫落的 懂了吧
It's eternal, see?

106
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,450
坦塔羅斯：源自希臘神話，喻指能夠看目標卻永遠達不到目標的痛苦

107
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,450
坦塔羅斯難求一死
Tantalus never achieved the escape of death.

108
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,560
樹枝上的果實總是放在他夠不著的地方
There's a fruit on the branches was just always out of his reach.

109
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,400
每次他彎腰喝水的時候溪水裏的水就退了
And the water in the stream receded every time he stooped down to drink.

110
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,450
這就是為什麼我們今天說這些話
And so that's why we say things today like

111
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,630
看那些誘人的餡餅
Look at those tantalizing pies.

112
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,320
謝謝 你會回來的 對吧？
Thank you, ya'll come back, y'heah?

113
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,340
是的 早餐吃餡餅 相信我吧
Yes, pies for breakfast! Just trust me on this.

114
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
嘿 各位 歡迎來到迪克西·道格餡餅店
Hey folks, welcome to Dixie Doug's.

115
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,810
我之前在這見過你 對吧？
- I've seen you here before, right?

116
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,390
是的 我其實已經來過好幾次了
- Yes, I've been here a couple of times as a matter of fact.

117
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,810
專點萊姆派吧？
- Partial to key lime pie?

118
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,660
是的 來兩份
- Oh yeah, I am. Two to go.

119
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,700
別糾結啦
Just go with it, please.

120
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,020
額 我就好這口
Uh. I-uh. It's a craving I indulge in.

121
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,070
吃這個雖然對我的身體沒什麼好處 我喜歡的東西都不...
It can't possibly be good for me. Nothing that I like is...

122
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,030
這是很好的餡餅 酸橙味
No, no. It's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

123
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,840
你是鼎鼎有名的迪克西·道格麼？
You would happen to be the famous Dixie Doug himself, huh?

124
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,520
當然不是 餡餅是全國派送的
- Heck, no. Pies are trucked throughout the country.

125
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,870
- 他們管這叫「特許經營」 明白了吧？- 哦
- They call it uh, 「franchising」, see? - Oh.

126
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,630
他們給我們提供攪拌機 掛上他們的招牌 就那個「餡餅小子」 是我們的吉祥物
They give us the spinners, the signage. That there's 「Pie Boy」 our mascot.

127
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,200
我一般不提這些的
I don't talk like that.

128
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,870
- 我從渥太華來的 -不會吧
- I'm from Ottawa. - No.

129
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,780
我完全買下它了
I completely bought it.

130
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,630
「這個餡餅真不錯」
「That's-a-great-a-pie」

131
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,750
那個小個子男人 他是意大利人嗎？
The.. The Little guy. Is he supposed to be Italian?

132
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,710
我猜是的
I guess so.

133
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,340
真聰明
That was very clever.

134
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,980
你們都回來了？
Y'all come back now, y'heah?

135
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,750
「你們都回來了」
「Y'all come back now」

136
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,530
你覺得他說這話是認真的嗎？
Do you think he meant it?

137
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,660
他注意到我了 你聽到了他說的那些
He had noticed me. You heard that.

138
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,940
這個餡餅真噁心
This pie is rather sordid.

139
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,120
不要吐出來 下次去的時候 我們試試其他味道
Don't spit it out. Next time we go, well try different flavor.

140
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,740
待會兒再吃
Save it for later.

141
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,330
上帝啊 換個台吧 我不想看那個台
Dear God, change that awfulness. I do not want to see that.

142
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,290
我不想看那個台
I do not want to see it.

143
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,550
這個台還行 這個台還行
That's better. That's better.

144
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,150
哦 看貝蒂！
Oh. Look at Betty!

145
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,700
年輕貌美
Oh. To be young and beautiful

146
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,960
如果時光可以倒流
If I could go back,

147
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,070
回到我18歲的時候
to when I was eighteen

148
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,360
我什麼都不知道 我會給自己一點建議
I didn't know anything about anything. I'd give myself a bit of advice.

149
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,810
什麼建議

150
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,110
比如說 保護好牙齒 多做點愛
I would say. Take better care of your teeth and fuck-a lot more.

151
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,530
真是好建議
That's very good advice.

152
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,400
我漂亮的寶貝
Pretty baby of mine.

153
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,230
我漂亮的寶貝
Pretty baby of mine.

154
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,550
看看這個
Will you look at this?

155
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,690
看看
Look.

156
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,950
這裏有我們國家最聰明的一群傢伙 而他們卻在這地板上到處撒尿
Some of the best minds in our country peeing all over the floor in this here facility.

157
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,990
嗯
Mh-mh-mhm.

158
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,330
連天花板上都是尿漬！
There's pee freckles on the ceiling!

159
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,380
他們怎麼撒上去的？
How do they get it up there?

160
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,700
你估計 他們下面那玩意得有多大啊？
Just how big a target do they need, you figure?

161
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,280
他們已經做了充足的練習 這是肯定的
They get enough practice that's for sure.

162
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,200
我的布魯斯特
My Brewster,

163
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,840
可沒人覺得他聰明
no one ever called him a great mind,

164
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,950
但是
but...

165
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,880
就算他 他都有百分之七十的幾率尿進小便池
even he... Man he just hits the can seventy percent of the time.

166
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,080
- 抱歉 先生 - 不不不 沒事 你們繼續打掃
- Excuse us, sir. - No, no, no. That's alright. Go ahead.

167
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,260
你們女士們好像聊得很開心
You ladies seem to be chatting enjoyably.

168
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,310
女士們總能聊得這麼熱火朝天
Girl talk no doubt.

169
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,630
不必介意我
Don't mind me.

170
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,370
艾麗莎
Elisa...

171
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,650
不要碰它
Look, don't touch.

172
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,700
那個可愛的玩意是阿拉巴馬產的
That lovely dingus right there is an Alabama Howdy-do

173
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,690
模制握柄 低電流 高電壓 用來電擊牛的
Molded grip handle. Low-current, High-voltage electric shock cattle prod.

174
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,390
我叫斯特裏克蘭 是安保人員
Name's Strickland, Security.

175
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,460
弗萊明的手下啊
Fleming's security.

176
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:39,420
不不 男士一般是便前或是便後洗手
Oh no, no. A man washes his hands before or after tending to his needs.

177
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,130
那這很能說明這個男人的特點
That tells you a lot about that man.

178
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,250
如果便前和便後都洗
If he does it both times,

179
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,510
說明他性格軟弱
Points to a weakness in character.

180
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,850
女士們
Ladies

181
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,290
和你們倆聊天非常開心
It was very pleasant chatting with you both.

182
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,600
矮個子的人很刻薄
Short people are mean.

183
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,480
我從來沒有遇到過哪個矮個子的好男人
I've never met a short man that stays nice all the way through.

184
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,300
他們都是暗箭傷人的小人
No, sir, mean little backstabbers, all of 'em.

185
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,900
也許地下缺氧還是什麼的
Maybe it's the air down there, not enough oxygen or somethin.

186
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,790
救命！他在流血！
Help! He's losing blood!

187
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,600
- 救命！- 快來 快來
- Help! - Come on. Come on.

188
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,250
你覺得俄國佬闖進來了麼？ 我可不這樣認為
You think the Russians broke in? I don't think so.

189
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,370
如果他們真的闖進來了 杜安的手下會把他們都殺了 親愛的
And If they did, Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

190
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,280
有兩聲槍響 你聽見了嗎？
It was two shots, you hear 'em?

191
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,630
其實是三聲 還有尖叫
Alright three, and that scream.

192
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,360
這裏究竟發生了什麼啊？
Whatever happens in this place?

193
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,060
你們兩個 跟我來
You two. Come with me.

194
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,530
現在就去麼 弗萊明先生？ 能讓我們先吃完飯嗎？
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir? Any chance we might conclude our dinner?

195
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,280
- 現在就來！- 哦
- Now! - Ugh.

196
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,930
天哪 我們遇到麻煩了 我們遇到麻煩了
Oh heavens to Betsy. We're in a pickle. We're in such a pickle.

197
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,760
只給你們20分鐘
You will have exactly twenty minutes,

198
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,390
把實驗室給我徹底打掃乾淨
to render this-this lab immaculate and so on and so forth.

199
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,610
20分鐘
Twenty minutes.

200
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,010
好多血
It's a lot of blood.

201
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,710
屎尿什麼的 我打掃起來沒問題
I can handle piss, I can handle poop...

202
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,320
但是血？ 我怕血
But blood? Mmm. Blood is just something to me.

203
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,870
拿去 幫我擦乾淨
Here Hon, help me mop it up.

204
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,820
我們越快離開這裏越好
The sooner we get out of here the better.

205
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,130
哦！
Oh!

206
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,140
是手指！
It's a finger!

207
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,180
兩隻手指！
It's two fingers!

208
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,480
好 好 把它們拿走 在這等著
Okay, okay. Put 'em away and just wait here.

209
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,960
我去叫弗萊明過來
I'm gonna get this to Fleming.

210
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,020
殘肢在哪兒？
Where are these body parts?

211
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,500
殘肢？
The body parts?

212
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,820
我相信你 親愛的 但是你確定它是活的？
No, I believe you, honey. Are you sure you it was alive?

213
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,920
因為我曾經在馬戲團看到過一隻美人魚
Because I saw a mermaid once in a carnival tent.

214
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,270
結果只是一隻猴子加了條魚尾巴而已 當時真唬住我了
And it was a monkey sewn to the tail of a fish. Looked real to me.

215
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,260
我確定

216
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,790
好吧 我道歉
Alright, I apologized.

217
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,640
我趕時間
I have a deadline

218
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,560
你知道嗎...
You know uh...

219
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,640
玉米片這種零食原本是用來防止手淫的
Corn Flakes were invented to prevent masturbation.

220
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,960
並不奏效
It didn't work.

221
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,100
哦 艾麗絲·費伊的節目開始了...
Oh, Alice Faye just started...

222
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,840
她是個大明星 巨星
She was a huge star, huge.

223
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,930
有一天她終於忍受不了圈子裏的那些屁事兒和潛規則
And one day she couldn't take the bullshit, the backstabbing anymore

224
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,590
就頭也不回地離開了那個圈子
and she just walked away from everything.

225
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,660
當垃圾來看的話 還算不錯 是吧？
Ta-da! It's not bad, is it? For being shit?

226
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,200
它不是垃圾

227
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,400
聽著 你吃完 就上床睡覺
Huh, listen. You eat, you go to bed, you rest.

228
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,470
等我拿到報酬後...
And when I get paid...

229
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,240
我們去吃派！不對 不是我們吃派
We get pie! No, we don't get pie.

230
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,860
我不要

231
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,100
是我吃派 你吃你想吃的
I get pie. You get whatever you want.

232
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,550
祝我好運
Wish me luck.

233
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,960
祝你好運

234
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,090
♫ 你不知道 我有多麼 ♫

- They want the gelatin to be green now. - But I was told red.

240
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,830
新理念 大勢所趨
New concept. That's the future, now.

241
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,690
綠色

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,190

更快樂 更快樂？
Happier. Happier?

244
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,460
這位父親看起來像剛發現了傳教士式體位(男上女下)
The Father looks like he just discovered the missionary position

245
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,080
賈爾斯
Giles.

246
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,250
好吧...他們還要怎麼高興?
Well uh... What would they supposed to be happy about?

247
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,120
客戶想要照片 我說服了他們
The client want the photographs. I sold them on this

248
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,530
- 很遺憾 它是件好作品 - 它確實是 不是嗎？
- It's too bad-this is nice work. - It is nice, isn't it?

249
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,260
我覺得它是我最好的作品了
I think it's one of my best.

250
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,360
你撐得住吧？
How are you holding up?

251
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,150
- 在喝酒嗎？ - 不 滴酒不沾
- You drinking? - No, not a drop. No.

252
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,620
你離開克萊恩&桑德斯公司之後找到什麼工作了嗎？
You get any work since you left Klein & Saunders?

253
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,320
你是指我被你辭退之後？
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

254
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,670
我現在不想談論這個
We're not gonna get into this now.

255
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,120
我想回來 伯尼

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,420
對於你們這類人來說 這並不常見 是嗎?
That's not common, is it? For your people?

270
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,790
我媽媽在生完我之後
My momma died after me.

271
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,330
就去世了
After I was born.

272
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,720
你名字裏的「D」是什麼意思？
What does the 「D」 stand for?

273
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,850
是黛利拉 長官
Delilah, Sir.

274
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,640
來自於聖經
On account of the bible.

275
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,910
黛利拉 她背叛了參孫
Delilah. She betrayed Samson.

276
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,100
在哄他入睡之後 剪去了他的頭髮
Lull him to sleep, cut his hair.

277
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,290
非利士人折磨並羞辱了他
Philistines torture him, humiliate him-

278
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,520
還把他的眼睛挖了出來
Burn his eyes out.

279
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,270
看來我媽媽似乎並沒有仔細讀聖經
I guess my momma didn't read the good book close enough

280
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,200
那你呢？
And you?

281
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,730
艾麗莎·埃斯波西托
Elisa Esposito.

282
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,620
埃斯波西托不是「孤兒」的意思嗎？
Doesn't Esposito means 「Orphan」?

283
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,260
兩位女士都是來自帕特南的可憐孤兒
Our Lady of Sorrows Orphanage in Putnam.

284
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,360
他們在河邊的水裏找到了她
They found her by the river in the water.

285
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,100
是你...找到了我的手指？
It was you... that found my fingers?

286
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,710
噢！謝謝
Oh! Thanks.

287
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,130
三個小時的手術
Three hours in surgery.

288
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,770
他們重塑了第一指節 縫合了肌腱
They rebuilt the first phalanx, here, sutured the tendons.

289
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,150
也不知道是否能癒合
Don't know if it's going to take it or not.

290
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,220
上面還沾上了點兒芥末
There was mustard on them.

291
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,130
- 用一個紙袋子裝？ - 當時只有這個能用了 長官
- A paper bag？ - It was all we had, Sir.

292
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,070
鑒於她不能說話 大部分都是我來回答
I answer mostly, on account that she can't talk.

293
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,450
她不能說話？她是聾子嗎？
She can't? Is she deaf?

294
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,690
是啞巴 長官
Mute, sir.

295
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,530
她說她能聽到你
She said she can hear you.

296
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,620
你脖子上的那些傷疤
All those scars on your neck.

297
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,760
原來是傷到了你的聲帶 對嗎？
That's what that it cut your voice box, right?

298
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,590
她說從她還是嬰兒的時候就是啞巴了
She said since she was a baby.

299
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,320
誰會那樣對待一個嬰兒？
Who would do that to a baby?

300
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,660
這個世界充滿了罪惡 不是嗎 黛利拉？
The world is sinful. Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

301
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,890
好了 我不廢話了
Well, let me say this upfront.

302
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,950
你們打掃那個實驗室 然後離開
You clean that lab. You get out.

303
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,070
我們保存在那兒的那個東西 是個恥辱
The thing we keep in there, is an affront.

304
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,130
你知道什麼是恥辱嗎 澤爾達？
Do you know what an affront is, Zelda?

305
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,210
令人反感的東西？
Something offensive?

306
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,900
沒錯 告訴你 我把那個...
That's right. And I should know, I've dragged that...

307
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,110
骯髒的東西
...filthy thing

308
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,690
從南美洲的沼澤地裏一路拉到這裏
out of the river muck in South America all the way here

309
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,740
並且路上我們都相處地不怎麼愉快
And along the way we didn't get to like each other much.

310
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,970
現在
Now.

311
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,760
你們可能會認為...那個東西看起來像人
You may think... that thing looks human

312
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,810
用兩條腿站立 對嗎？
Stands on two legs, right?

313
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,790
但是...神 是按照自己的模樣 創造人類的
But... we're created in the Lord's image.

314
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,750
你該不會覺得上帝就是長那樣吧？
You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?

315
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,690
先生 我不知道上帝長什麼樣
I wouldn't know, Sir. What the Lord looks like.

316
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,640
人的樣子 澤爾達 上帝長得像人 像我一樣
Well, human, Zelda. He looks like a human, like me.

317
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,000
或者像你
Or even you.

318
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,210
我覺得可能長得更像我一點
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

319
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,550
好 就這樣吧
Well, that's all.

320
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,100
霍伊特將軍 感謝您的回電
General Hoyt. Thank you for calling me back, Sir.

321
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,130
- 你好點兒了嗎？- 是的 將軍 好多了
- You feel better? - Oh yes, Sir. Much better.

322
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,490
多虧了止痛藥
Pain pills, is all.

323
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,130
- 你被弄斷了兩根手指頭 是這樣嗎？ - 沒錯 兩根手指頭
- You lost two fingers. You wasn't? - Two fingers yeah. He got two fingers.

324
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,910
但是我的大拇指 食指 中指都還健在
But I still got my thumb, my trigger and my pussy finger

325
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,760
聽起來你應該沒事了 - 是的 將軍
Sounds to me like you'll be all right. - Yes, sir, that's right.

326
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,640
期待您日後大駕光臨 將軍
Looking forward to your visit, Sir.

327
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,290
項目的事還需要您來作決策
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

328
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,160
雞蛋

329
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,600
...位於樸次茅斯市中心地段
...free to locations on Downtown Portermouth.

330
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,360
坐擁未來之地
The Future is here.

331
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,070
去休息吧
Get to rest.

332
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,280
9點30來接我
Pick me up on 9:30.

333
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,540
21點30分 知道了 先生
Twenty one hundred and thirty hours. Yes, Sir.

334
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,050
...買不了吃虧買不了上當
...that's great to buy.

335
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,770
我回來了
I'm home.

336
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,120
我給你做了一個煎蛋卷
I made you an omelet!

337
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,330
- 爸爸！告訴你件事情 - 沒有煎餅？
- Hey Dad! Guess what? - No pancakes?

338
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,180
我把家裏的箱子翻了個底朝天 就是找不到平底鍋
I've gone half through the boxes. I can't find the griddle...

339
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
- 我就給你做了個奶酪西蘭花煎蛋餅 - 告訴你件事情
- I made you cheese and broccoli omelette, - Guess what?

340
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,220
你怎麼樣了？疼嗎？
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

341
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,450
- 有一點 止疼藥管點兒用 - 告訴你件事情
- A little bit. Pills help. - Guess what?

342
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,860
- 什麼? - 我們埋了一個時間膠囊 就在新學校那
- What? - We're burying a time capsule, at the new school.

343
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,300
我想問你
I wanted to ask you.

344
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,690
我們未來真的會有噴氣式背包出現嗎？
Do you think we'll all have jet packs, in the future?

345
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,440
- 一定會有的 孩子 - 公交車來了
- Believe it son. - Bus is here.

346
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,260
這裏是美國
This is America.

347
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,000
再見 爸爸！
Bye dad!

348
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,060
趕緊吃完蛋卷 洗完手到樓上來 親愛的
Finish your omelet and wash your hands real good and come upstairs, Sweetie.

349
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,860
我還挺喜歡這裏的
I kinda like it here.

350
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,750
孩子們喜歡草坪 華盛頓離這裏也就半個小時的路程
The kids like the lawn. Plus, DC is just half an hour away, isn't it?

351
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,860
不管怎麼說 這裏是巴爾的摩 伊蓮 沒有人喜歡這裏
It's still Baltimore, Elaine. No one likes Baltimore.

352
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,320
你知道我是怎麼想的嗎？
You know what I'm thinking?

353
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,010
我覺得 我需要一輛新車
I'm thinking. I need a new car.

354
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,850
需要一輛新車是嗎？
Do you need a new car, do you?

355
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,360
凱迪拉克怎麼樣 先生？
How about a Cadillac, Mr.?

356
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,510
理查德
Richard.

357
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,930
噢
Oh.

358
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,220
噢
Oh

359
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,980
噢 理查德！
Oh, Richard!

360
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,530
親愛的 親愛的 親愛的 你的手在流血
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. Your hand is bleeding.

361
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,980
安靜 別說話
Silence. Don't talk. I want you in silence.

362
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,240
安靜
Silence.

363
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,560
安靜
Silence.

364
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,810
音樂

365
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,100
音樂

366
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,100
音樂

367
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,330
你還好吧？

368
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,700
麻雀窩中睡
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

369
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,340
什麼？
What?

370
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,760
麻雀窩中睡
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

371
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,160
魂斷獵鷹喙
And the eagle takes the prey.

372
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:18,860
什麼？
What?

373
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,400
暗號...

374
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,900
「魂斷獵鷹喙」

375
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,930
走吧

376
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,560
鮑勃！
Bob!

377
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,560
鮑勃!

378
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,230
近來如何

379
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,300
我在這狗屁水泥屋子裏

380
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,160
像個傻子一樣等了你足足一個小時

381
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,130
每次都是在這個爛餐廳接頭！

382
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,500
我會改地兒的

383
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,660
但是你沒有

384
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,700
告訴我們

385
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,660
"鮑勃"

386
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,400
叫我迪米特裏

387
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,430
同志們

388
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,400
我不是"鮑勃"

389
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,260
這是什麼?

390
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,660
迪米特裏

391
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,530
解剖學筆記...

392
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,900
還有...

393
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,260
實驗室結構圖

394
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
項目的研究地點

395
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,960
我們從這抽身所需要的一切

396
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,960
都在這了

397
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,860
我會向上級匯報的

398
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,130
我們必須得盡快把這事搞定

399
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,960
米哈爾科夫...

400
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,130
這個生物...

401
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,000
我覺得它能夠

402
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,200
與人交流

403
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:35,960
交流?

404
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
是的 與人交流

405
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,960
我有足夠證據證明

406
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,530
它是種高智商物種

407
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,860
它會識別

408
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,530
它會識別...

409
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,060
語言...

410
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,130
能對音樂作出反應...

411
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,560
你能把這些

412
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,630
也報告給上級嗎？

413
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,660
我會的

414
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,300
現在...

415
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,130
吃吧 迪米特裏

416
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,800
他們把這道菜叫做...

417
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,160
海鮮...

418
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,860
及牛排

419
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,330
海陸大餐

420
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,430
煮好的龍蝦放在這

421
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,000
滋喇滋喇的

422
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,430
但是有點...

423
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,900
過軟了...

424
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,600
還太甜了

425
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,470
艾麗莎！快點！快點！過來
Elisa! Hurry! Hurry! Come on.

426
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,630
快打卡 上帝啊 姑娘
Swipe it. God, girl.

427
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,720
- 你又這樣 澤爾達 - 噢 你老人家歇口氣吧 約蘭達！
- You're doing it again, Zelda. - Oh. Give it a rest, Yolanda!

428
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,430
- 嘿 澤爾達 來一支不 - 吸煙有害健康 杜安
- Hey, Zelda, you want to smoke? - That shit's ain't good for you, Duane.

429
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,670
沒錯 但是一天不抽心發慌
Yeah. But it feel good.

430
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,000
那倒是真的 不是嗎？
It does, doesn't it?

431
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,800
來嘛 艾麗莎 就一支
C'mon Elisa, just one.

432
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,560
來嘛 來嘛 來嘛
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon

433
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,050
別擔心那些攝像頭
Don't worry about that camera.

434
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,730
我們在休息時間都把它挪開了
We push them off on break time.

435
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:16,780
嗯哼
Uh- mm

436
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,430
這裏是個視角盲點
This here's a blind spot.

437
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,990
我可能要在這裏完成一些事情 請將軍過來 行嗎？
I may have to finish some things in here, fetch the General, will ya?

438
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,360
噢 你想我了？
Oh. You miss me, huh?

439
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,370
我帶了一包水果糖
I took a candy break.

440
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,810
你怕這個啊？
This is what scares you, huh?

441
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,720
那我就用這個吧
Jeez, be used to it by now.

442
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,710
又來了！發出那種炸耳朵的聲音
There you go again. Making that god- awful sound.

443
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,380
是在哭嗎？叫什麼？
Is that you crying, huh? Is that what it is?

444
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,460
你疼麼？啊？
Are you hurting? Huh?

445
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,430
或者說你很憤怒？
Or maybe you're angry?

446
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,130
或者說你還想再咬我一口
Maybe you'd like to get another bite at me.

447
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,310
啊？來啊
Huh? Go ahead.

448
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,450
你還真敢啊
I can't tell.

449
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,520
你在求饒嗎？
Are you begging?

450
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,220
對於我來說 這是我聽過最難聽的噪音
'Cause to me it's just the worst fucking noise I've ever heard.

451
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:20,920
艾麗莎？
Elisa?

452
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,900
艾麗莎！
Elisa!

453
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,360
霍伊特將軍！歡迎光臨！
General Hoyt! Welcome, Sir!

454
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,460
一切都準備就緒 很榮幸您能來這 將軍！
Everything's ready. Glad to have you here, Sir!

455
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,320
- 見到你很高興 小伙子 - 謝謝
- Good to see you, son. - Thank you.

456
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,630
我的老天 就是這個嗎？
Good God Almighty, Is that it?

457
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,750
比我想像中要大
A lot bigger than I thought.

458
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,980
奇醜無比
Ugly as sin.

459
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,740
你知道嗎 亞馬遜土著把這玩意兒當神來供著
You know, the natives in the Amazon worshipped it as a God.

460
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,260
我倒是真看不出來這是個什麼神
It doesn't look like much of a God now, does it?

461
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,640
嗯 他們是原始人 將軍
Well, they were primitive, Sir. You know they tossed offerings

462
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,110
他們都用些花啊草啊水果什麼的當供品
into the water, flowers, fruits, crap like that.

463
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,430
他們還想用弓箭阻止我們石油開採
Then they tried to stop the oil drill with bows and arrows.

464
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,840
他們的下場可不太妙
That didn't turn out too well.

465
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,290
他在流血 怎麼回事？
He's bleeding. What happened?

466
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:06,840
怎麼回事？
What happened?

467
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,040
它就是個畜生 霍夫斯德勒 不用管它
It's an animal, Hoffstetler. Just keeping it tame.

468
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,510
「氧氣的滲透作用與二氧化碳的置換」
「Oxygen osmosis and dioxide exchange.」

469
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,610
- 為什麼要抓來這玩意？- 這個物種 長官
- What the hell we got here, Son? - This creature, Sir

470
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,090
可以在兩個獨立的呼吸系統之間轉換
It can alternate between two entirely separate breathing mechanisms.

471
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,310
- 彈塗魚也能做到 - 不
- Mudskipper can do that. - No.

472
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,570
如果你想把人送進太空
Look. You want to put a man in space.

473
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,060
他必須要適應 人類不能適應的各種環境
He's gonna have to endure conditions the human body just wasn't made for.

474
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,510
在我們同蘇聯人的太空競賽中 這能讓我們佔上風
This gives us an edge against the Soviets.

475
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,460
他在空氣中能存活多久?
How long can it breathe outside the water?

476
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,570
事實上 長官 我們並不瞭解這東西
Reality, is, Sir. We don't know jackshit about this thing.

477
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,490
我們都知道 蘇聯人想研究它
Well, the Soviets want it. We know that much.

478
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,160
那些混蛋
Those cockeyed bastards.

479
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,220
他們把狗送進太空 我們可以嘲笑他們
You know, they let them send a dog up in the space and we get a good laugh.

480
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,670
但是緊接著他們 把人也送上去了
Then next thing you know, they send a human up.

481
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,120
一個衛星繞著地球飛 天知道在搞些什麼陰謀詭計
A Ruskie, orbiting our planet, doing God knows what?

482
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,670
現在輪到 赫魯曉夫笑了
Who's laughing now? Krushchev.

483
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,980
他們送狗上了太空 他開心了 接著把一個蘇聯混蛋送上天
That's it. We let him put a dog in space, he laughs, puts a commie in space

484
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,620
他又笑了 然後他向古巴發射了導彈
he laughs, puts missiles in Cuba.

485
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,540
我們啥也沒學到
Have we learned nothing?

486
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,540
長官 我要把它放回水中
Sir. We need to get him back in the water

487
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,550
你看這些科學家 他們就像藝術家 愛上了他們的玩物
See this Scientist, they are like artists. They fall in love with their playthings.

488
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,110
這裏 長官 看這裏
Now, right here-you see? Along the middle?

489
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,180
這個生物有一塊厚實的關節軟骨組織 將主要和次要肺分開了
This creature has a thick jointed cartilage separating the primary and secondary lungs.

490
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,940
我說得對吧 鮑勃?
Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?

491
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,180
- 是的 但是我們必須要... - 光拍X光片是不夠的
- Yes, but we have to... - It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

492
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,850
- 理論上是的 長官 但我們要先... - 如果我們要打敗蘇聯人
- In principle, Sir, yes but... - If we want to get the edge on the Soviets

493
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,470
- 我們應該 解刨這個東西 - 不 不行
- we need to vivisect this thing. - No, no, no.

494
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,140
- 解剖它 從裏到外研究 - 不能這樣
- Take it apart. Learn how it works. - No.

495
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,250
不 不行  那不是我們的初衷
No. That would defeat the purpose

496
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,150
長官 他暈過去了 救救他吧
Sir? He's passed out. Please.

497
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,590
把它放進罐子裏 給他加壓
Put him in the tank. Let him pressurize.

498
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,780
霍伊特將軍
General Hoyt, sir!

499
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,980
在任何情況下 您都不能殺死這個生物
You cannot, under any circumstance, kill this creature.

500
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,150
數數這些星星 小伙子 一共有五個!
Count these with me, Son. There's five of them.

501
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,910
這證明我可以 為所欲為
That means I can do whatever the hell I want.

502
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,060
如果你想聊你的研究 我會聽你說完
You wanna plead your case? I'll listen to it.

503
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,920
但最後.. 是我下決定
But, end of the day, it is my damn decision.

504
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,250
把那該死的玩意剖開
Crack the damn thing open.

505
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,300
仔細研究研究 結束任務了
Lean what you can and close up shot.

506
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,740
好好休息一下 斯特裏克蘭
And give yourself a good pat on the back, Strickland.

507
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,690
- 就這樣吧 - 謝謝 長官
- You've done it. - Thank you sir.

508
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,340
現在快點開始吧 小伙子
Now hurry up and finish this job, son.

509
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,820
馬上開始 長官
Absolutely, sir.

510
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,880
救他出來? 你在想些什麼?
Get him out? What are you talking?

511
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,590
不 絕對不行
No! Absolutely not!

512
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,580
因為這是犯法! 這就是原因
Because it's breaking the law! And that's what.

513
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,960
可能連談論它 都犯法了
We're probably breaking the law, just talking about it.

514
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,630
他很孤獨

515
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,750
非常孤獨

516
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,610
"他很孤獨!" 是麼
Oh, he's alone. Oh.

517
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,490
那我們每次去中餐館吃飯
This mean that... whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant

518
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,200
你都要解救浴缸裏的每條魚麼?
you want to save every fish in the tank?

519
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,500
所以他孤單又怎麼樣呢? 我們都孤單
So what if he's alone? We're all alone.

520
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,170
"它是我見過最孤單的東西"
It's the loneliest thing you've ever seen

521
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,880
好吧 你自己都說了
Well you just said it, right? You just said it.

522
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,980
你說他是個「東西」他是個怪胎
You called it a thing. It's a thing. It's a freak.

523
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,660
念出我的手語

524
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,790
我明白你的意思
I can understand you.

525
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,960
你根本沒在聽

526
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:42,700
重複一遍

527
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,130
重複

528
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:43,500
重複

529
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,470
冷靜 我的天 冷靜
Calm down! God, calm down!

530
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,200
念出我的手語

531
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,960
好吧 我重複說一遍
Alright. I will... I will repeat it to you.

532
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:54,830
「我是什麼?」
"What I am?

533
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,880
我張開嘴巴 和他一樣
I move my mouth, like him.

534
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,130
我發不出任何聲音 和他一樣
I make no sound, like him.

535
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,420
那又如何?
What does that make me?

536
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,020
現在我的一切 和我所經歷的
All that I am, all that I've ever been

537
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,480
都把我 引向他
Brought me here to him.

538
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,660
你用的是「他」 現在改稱"他" 了嗎?
You see, you're saying "him". It's a "him" now.

539
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,340
這...
It's a...

540
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,210
你打到我了!
You just hit me!

541
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,930
艾麗莎 放開我
Elisa, let go of me.

542
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,160
我聽著呢 你從來沒打過我！
I'm looking, I'm looking. You've never... hit me!

543
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,060
"當他看向我的時候 他看著我的方式
When he looks at me, the way he looks at me.

544
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,930
他並不覺得我缺少什麼
He does not know what I lack.

545
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,920
也不會覺得我是不完整的
Or how I am incomplete.

546
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:00,060
他看到的我 是真實的我
He sees me for what I am, as I am.

547
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,010
他見到我很快樂
He's happy to see me

548
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,790
每天 每次見到他 都是如此
Every time, every day.

549
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:17,910
現在 我要麼救他
And now I can either save him...

550
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,840
要麼讓他死去 "
...or let him die.

551
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,730
我要走了 我必須離開了
I'm leaving. I have to... no I have to leave.

552
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,070
艾麗莎 住手! 聽我說
Just Elisa, please stop! Listen to me. Just listen to me.

553
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,580
我要走了 我現在必須離開
I have to go! I'm leaving now because this...

554
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,700
艾麗莎 這對我很重要 這是我第二次機會!
Elisa, this is very important to me. This is a second chance for me!

555
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,440
對不起 但我得走
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

556
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,840
當我回來的時候 我們再也不要討論這個了
And when I come back. We will not talk about this, ever again.

557
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,640
艾麗莎... 夠了
Elisa... there's... Alright. Alright.

558
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,170
我們是什麼 你和我算什麼? 我們沒辦法!
What are we? What are you and I? What we are? We are nothing!

559
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,650
我們一點辦法都沒有
Nothing. We can't do nothing!

560
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,440
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

561
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,650
但這...它...
But this-this-this is just...

562
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,220
根本不是人類!
Oh god! He's not even human!

563
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,610
我的天
God.

564
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,180
什麼
What?

565
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,700
如果我們

566
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,030
什麼也不做

567
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
那我們也算不上人類

568
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,470
吉爾斯!
Giles!

569
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,600
- 我在等你 - 我知道 對不起
- I've been waiting. - I know, sorry.

570
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,170
沒關係
It's okay.

571
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,140
進去談嗎?
We going in?

572
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,640
你把畫寄過來就好
You should've just mailed the art.

573
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,840
不 我想親自給你和你的團隊看
No! I wanted to show you it to you and the team and person

574
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,210
這是我的傑作
It's some of my best work.

575
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,400
已經不能更綠了！
And this green as can be!

576
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,350
這個...
It's uh...

577
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,610
現在好像不太合適 也許以後再談吧
It's not a good time. Maybe later.

578
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,320
好吧 沒問題
Oh well, sure, no problem.

579
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,510
你什麼時間合適呢 伯尼?
What would be good time for you, Bernie?

580
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,500
這是你畫的嗎？
You painted that?

581
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,870
是啊
Yeah.

582
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,410
哇！你可真棒！
Wow! You're good!

583
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,260
不過沒有照片那樣逼真
Apparently, not as good as a photograph.

584
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,390
但也不錯了 是嗎？
But it's good, isn't it, huh?

585
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,500
反正我畫不出來
Pfft. I couldn't paint like that.

586
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,580
來吧 我請了
Here. On me.

587
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:30,980
給我的？
For me?

588
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,690
我們這沒有多少你這樣的人 你看起來...
We don't get many like you in here. You seem...

589
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,230
很有教養 我喜歡跟你聊天
very educated. I like talking to you.

590
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,870
事實上...嗯...
The thing is... That's the...

591
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,470
我來這的原因是...
The only reason that I come in here is...

592
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,630
是來聊天的 而且這派味道真不錯 是嗎？
The conversation. And the pie is mighty fine too, isn't it?

593
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,580
嗯 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

594
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,270
沒加檸檬 但是很美味
It's no key lime. But it's good.

595
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,240
是這樣的 我獨自一人工作
You know, I work alone. And uh...

596
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,340
我最好的朋友不怎麼喜歡聊天
my best friend is not much of a conversationalist.

597
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,710
知道嗎？聊天也是在這工作的一部分
You see? That's part of being on the job here.

598
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,260
比如做個調酒師
It's like being a bartender.

599
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,340
你為客人做餡餅 傾聽他們的故事 慢慢瞭解他們
You serve people pie, you listen to their problems. Get to know them.

600
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,890
我想要更瞭解你
I'd like to get to know you better.

601
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,440
你在幹嘛 老傢伙？
- What the hell are you doing, old man?

602
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,440
噢 抱歉
Whoa. Oh- oh.

603
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,800
嘿！別坐吧檯 把東西打包帶走 你們不能坐這
Hey! No- no- no. Not the counter. Take out only. You can't sit there.

604
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,850
你們想要什麼 就點好 然後打包帶走
You want something, you order, you take it out.

605
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,650
但店裏很空啊 吧檯...
But it's empty... The counter is-

606
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,960
有人預訂了 訂了一整天 你不能在這坐
All reserved. All day. You don't sit down.

607
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,140
歡迎再來啊 聽見了嗎？
Y'all come back now, Y'hear?

608
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,990
你沒必要這樣跟他們說話
You don't need to talk to them like that.

609
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,420
你也該走了
You should go, too.

610
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,870
別再來了 這裏是家庭餐廳
And don't come back. This is a family restaurant.

611
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,890
我找不到其他人聊天了
I have no one.

612
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,590
你是唯一一個能聽我說話的人
And you're the only person that I can talk to.

613
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:07,930
聽著
Now.

614
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,100
你想要什麼都可以
Whatever this thing is

615
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,080
只要你說需要
You need it.

616
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,320
那麼
So...

617
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,200
你只需要告訴我該怎麼做就行
You just tell me what to do.

618
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,170
- 「所有往事...」 - 「春日已逝」
- "All those things..." - "As the spring recedes..."

619
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,510
走吧
Let's go!

620
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,100
莫斯科方面不會支持你的計劃

621
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,560
為什麼?

622
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,400
風險太大

623
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,360
時間太緊

624
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,560
什麼?！

625
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,830
我們只有兩個選項 迪米特裏

626
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,900
其一...

627
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,830
你想辦法推遲計劃

628
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,230
至少一周

629
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,730
但他們明天就要實施了

630
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:07,600
所以...

631
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,460
只剩下

632
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,560
第二個選擇

633
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,760
以色列炸彈

634
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:20,030
你把它安在保險絲盒子上

635
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,730
然後會停電十分鐘

636
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:27,930
沒有監控 沒有阻礙

637
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,930
然後...

638
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,760
你把這個給它注射

639
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,460
注射

640
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,830
殺了它

641
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,160
毀了它

642
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,960
你還好嗎?

643
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,430
我來到這個國家

644
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,560

645
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:58,760
既是一個愛國者...

646
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,100
也是科學家

647
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,460
我們還有許多可以學習的

648
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,300
我們不需要學

649
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,330
我們只要讓美國人

650
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,960
沒機會學

651
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,170

57歲吧
Fifty seven.

685
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,970
我帶上假髮吧 這樣是可行的
I put the hair on, I can pull it off.

686
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,000
我可以穿這件 我應該...
I can wear this. Or I have to uh...

687
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:15,070
我還有這件 這件好像在說「有工作的男人」
Or I have this. This I think this one says 「Working Man」.

688
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:24,050
還有這件 這件奶油糖色的假領帶 有點隨意又有點時髦
Now this. This says with butterscotch "tie「 it says casual but with stylish」.

689
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:28,670
你喜歡這件？我同意 我覺得我們準備好了
So, you like this? I agree. I agree. I think we're ready.

690
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:50,830
斯特裏克蘭先生
Mr. Strickland!

691
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,270
莎莉 你能叫埃斯波西托小姐來打掃一下撒掉的水嗎
Sally, could you call Mrs. Esposito to clean up this spill?

692
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,940
知道嗎 我自己想不明白 你並沒什麼好看的
You know, I can't figure it out myself. You're not much to look at.

693
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,240
但想想看 我一直在想著你
Go figure. I keep thinking about you.

694
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,680
你說你是啞巴 你是完全不能出聲
When you say you're mute, are you entirely silent

695
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,330
還是能咿呀點聲響？
Or do you squawk a little?

696
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,360
有些啞巴能出聲 不怎麼好聽
Some of you squawk. Not pretty.

697
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,890
我只是想讓你知道 我不怕傷疤
I just want you to know. I do not care about the scars.

698
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,250
我不在意那些傷疤
I don't mind those scars.

699
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,850
我也不在乎你不會講話
I don't mind that you can't speak, either.

700
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,570
你在我面前跪下的時候
When you come right down to it

701
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,590
我喜歡這樣

704
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,600
我敢肯定我會讓你叫出聲來
I bet I can make you squawk a little.

705
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:23,100
嘿 親愛的 你還好嗎？
Hey, honey, are you okay?

706

你快點收拾 我想早點回家
You hurry up. I want to be home early.

707
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,100
我的腳痛死了
My feet are killin' me.

708
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,410
我們必須延遲計劃
We need to delay the procedure.

709
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,350
進我的辦公室要敲門
Knock before you enter my office.

710
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,690
這很緊急！
This is urgent!

書名：《積極思考出奇效》

712
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,440
出去 敲門我才讓你進來 然後再談事情
Go back out. Knock. Then I'll let you in and we'll talk.

713
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,540
這是規矩 按規矩行事

幫我把門關一下好嗎？
Will you get the door for me, please?

716
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,120
看見了嗎？這就對了嘛 現在我們可以談事情了
See? That is the way. Now we talk.

717
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,320
我還需要時間
I need more time.

718
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,390
不要讓你的挫敗感
Don't let the fact that you feel like a loser now

719
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,890
- 和你的求勝心切影響到... - 我沒有求勝心切！
- that your competitive tendencies... - I'm not competitive!

720
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,100
我不想毀滅這麼複雜且美麗的生物
I don't want an intricate, beautiful thing destroyed.

721
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,890
這個東西死了之後 你學到了東西 我也會離開這裏
This thing dies. You learn. I leave. Out of here.

722
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,730
和我的家人一起 在某個安靜美麗的城市安定下來
Settle down. My family settles down. Somewhere. Nice. A real city.

723
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:59,010
這種生物非常聰明 具備語言能力
This creature is intelligent. Capable of language,

724
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,070
能理解情感
of understanding emotions.

725
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,350
蘇聯人 亞洲佬不也是這樣麼
So are the Soviets, the Gooks

726
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,120
我們照樣殺了他們 不是麼？
And we still kill them, don't we?

727
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,860
關鍵是 這裏不是動物園
The bottom line is, this is not a petting zoo.

728
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,580
而且我再也不想在這個鬼地方多呆一秒了
And I don't want to be in this shithole any longer than I need.

729
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,770
你想嗎？
Do you?

730
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,800
鮑勃！你想嗎？
Bob! Do you?

731
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,030
不 我不想
No, I don't.

732
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,890
嘿 你還在等什麼？

- Have you seen Elisa? - Come on, Zelda!

734
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,790
你是不是在攝像頭上動了手腳？在裝貨碼頭上？
Did you move the camera? On the loading dock?

735
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,880
你是要把他帶到那去嗎？帶他經過服務隧道？
Is that where you are taking him? Through the service tunnels?

736
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,430
真是聰明啊
That's very smart.

737
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,940
誰在背後指使你的？
Who do you work for?

738
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,650
水的含鹽量必須保持在5%到8%
Water must be kept at 5 to 8 percent salinity.

739
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:37,940

740

把這個加入水中 三天一次
Mixed one of these in this water. Every three days.

The lights will go out, so be prepared.

你瘋了嗎？
Are you out of your mind?

749
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,780
不要這樣做 艾麗莎！別這麼做！
Do not do this, Elisa! Don't do this!

750
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:31,420

770
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,580
我真的不擅長這個

你聞到鎂的味道了嗎？
Do you smell the magnesium?

俄國人恨死猶太人了 但還是用他們做的這些小玩意
The Russians hate the Jews, but they can't get enough of their gadgets

Prepare to present your ID and entrance card

816
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,390
你讓我們惹上大麻煩了！
You got us in trouble!

817
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:32,430
在我看來 我們面對的一個受過高度訓練的組織 先生
In my opinion, we are looking at a highly trained group, Sir.

818
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:36,670
長官 我覺得是特種部隊之類的
I'm thinking, conceivably, Sir. Special Forces and so on and so forth.

819
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,220
蘇軍特種部隊？
Red Army Special forces?

820
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,200
八九不離十
Conceivably.

821
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:43,540
一個受過高度訓練 經費充足的精英組織
A highly-trained, well-financed, elite group.

822
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:46,810
高效率 殘忍的 工作極其精準
Highly efficient, ruthless, clockwork precision.

823
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,050
潛入行動不到五分鐘就結束了 先生
Infiltration took less than five minutes, Sir.

824
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,340
我怎麼都覺得要花上十分鐘才能完成行動吧
I can sure the estimate of this Strict Force of at least 10 minutes.

825
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,520
你一直是一個人呆著嗎？
Have you always been alone?

826
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,010
你有過朋友嗎？
Did you ever have someone?

827
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,800
你知道你發生了什麼嗎？你知道嗎？
Do you know what happened to you? Do you?

828
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,020
因為我不知道 我不知道我身上發生了什麼
'Cause I don't. I don't know what happen to me.

829
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,320
我不知道
I don't know.

830
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:28,410
我照鏡子 唯一能認出的就是那雙眼睛了
I look in the mirror, the only thing that I recognize are these eyes.

831
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,300
長在一個老男人的臉上
In this old man's face.

832
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:40,550
有時我覺得我生的太早 有時又覺得生的太晚了
And sometimes I think I was either both too early or too late for my life.

833
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,800
可能我們倆都是老古董吧
Maybe we're both just relics.

834
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,910
先生 我找到他們了
Sir? I got them.

835
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,020
澤爾達 艾麗莎 請進
Zelda, Elisa. Come in.

836
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,870
看來在事情發生之前 你們倆已經打卡下班了
Looks like you two, punched out before the incident.

837
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:16,830
所以
So.

838
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,700
如果你們知道關於一些洩露物的信息
If you know something about what transpired here.

839
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,290
你們有義務去報告所有的細節
It's your obligation to report any detail.

840
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,890
無論這些細節多麼的微不足道
No matter how small or trivial it may seem.

841
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,650
「微不足道」的意思是「不重要」
"Trivial" means "unimportant".

842
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:33,240
我沒發現有什麼反常的 沒有
I didn't seem nothin' out of the ordinary. No.

843
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:36,690
微不足道的也沒有 你看 我的腳傷了
Or trivial. See? My feet were hurting...

844
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,840
那你呢？
What about you?

845
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,410
她什麼都沒看到
She didn't see anything.

846
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,140
霍夫斯德勒  霍夫斯德勒博士
Hoffstetler. Dr. Hoffstetler.

847
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:56,970
你看到他進出過這個實驗室嗎？
Did either of you see him coming in or out of the lab?

848
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,050
他在這兒工作 不是嗎？
He works there, doesn't he?

849
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,050
我說的是另一個意思
I mean in a different way.

850
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:02,960
做一些不尋常的事情
Doing something different.

851
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,480
你是說微不足道的那種事麼 沒有 先生
Something trivial? No sir.

852
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:24,170
我在這兒幹什麼？
What am I doing?

853
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,520
我居然詢問你們這些傢伙
Interviewing the fucking help...

854
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,850
洗衣服的
The shit cleaners...

855
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:32,540
掃廁所的
The piss wipers.

856
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,100
你們兩個走吧 離開這兒
You two, go ahead. Leave.

857
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:50,560
你跟我說什麼？
What did you say to me?

858
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:58,540
- 她說什麼？-我不知道
- What did she say? - I didn't catch it.

859
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:04,820
- 他說什麼？- 她說「謝謝你」
- What is she saying?! - She is saying "Thank you".

860
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,000
下一個
Next.

861
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:58,370
我們要做的只有一件事了
There's only one thing left to do.

862
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,990
「志願者」
"Volunteer".

863
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,530
不要！不要！
No! No!

864
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:56,220
我想早點回家
I want to get home early.

865
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:00,310
最近布魯斯特很愛生氣...
Brewster has been in a bad mood lately...

866
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:04,590
聖主耶穌！
Holy Jesus!

867
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:07,000
你躲在女士更衣室幹什麼？
What are you doing standing in the shadows of the women's locker room??

868
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,100
他們可能一直在看著我 這兒應該沒有攝像機
They may be watching me, and there are no cameras here/

869
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,190
理由不錯嘛
For good reason.

870
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,090
你在這個時候見我們是有何貴幹？
What if you caught us in an inconvenient moment?

871
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,940
- 我需要知道他是否安好 - 它很好
- I need to know that he is alright. - He is.

872
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,330
- 什麼時候放它走？ - 會盡快的
- When will you release him? - Soon.

873
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,690
當雨水將連接大海的水道填滿的時候
When the rain fills the canal that flows to the sea.

874
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,640
如果你需要任何幫助
If you need anything.

875
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,810
放了它 趕緊的
Release him. Soon.

876
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,760
她說什麼？
What did she say?

877
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:34,640
她說 「你是個好人」霍夫斯德勒博士
She said, you're a good man, Doctor Hoffstetler.

878
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,320
我叫德米特裏
My name is Dimitri.

879
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,070
很高興認識你
Honored to meet you.

880
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,620
嗨 啞巴！有你的電話！
Hey, dummy! Phone call for you.

881
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:49,750
很緊急
It's urgent.

882
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:59,150
不用擔心我 我很好 相信我 我沒事
Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Believe me, I'm fine.

883
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,560
你受傷了 你流血了

884
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:02,820
它跑了 這不是他的錯
He ate Pandora, it wasn't his fault.

885
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,330
他是一個野生動物
He's a wild creature.

886
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:06,360
我們不能要求它做其他任何事情
We can't ask him to be anything else.

887
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:09,500
艾莉莎 去找他 快去！
Elisa, Go find him. Go. Go!

888
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,120
快去！
Go!

889
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,120
你很幸運
You're lucky.

890
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:21,300
我一直在努力保持清醒
I stayed awake as long as I could

891
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,120
但畢竟我不是年輕人了
But I'm not even a young man anymore.

892
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,240
他還好麼？你確定麼？
Is he alright? You sure?

893
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,840
你要去哪兒？ 別 別
Where are you going? No, no.

894
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,750
好的 別別 別和小貓呆在一起
Ok. No, no. Don't play with the kitties.

895
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:38,350
別跟它們在一起玩
Don't play with the kitties.

896
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,520
我不生氣
I'm not angry.

897
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,820
你確實這麼做了 沒關係 我覺得這不衛生
You did that. That's okay. Ooh. I don't think that's sanitary.

898
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,340
可以了
Enough.

899
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,220
有趣的傢伙
Interesting guy.

900
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,860
全體人員請注意
All personnel.

901
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,380
請準備好你們的身份證和門禁卡
Prepare to present your ID and entrance card.

902
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,200
你找我？
You wanted to see me?

903
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,240
那個調查進行得怎麼樣了？
How's it going? The investigation?

904
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,940
噢 進展不錯
Well, we have a promising lead.

905
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:34,710
是麼？
Really?

906
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,920
那挺好的
That's good to hear.

907
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:40,850
你從加爾維斯頓調過來
You joined us in Galveston.

908
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,620
- 但你之前在哪裏工作呢 霍夫斯德勒？- 博士
- But where were you before, Hoffstetler? - Doctor.

909
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,450
- 什麼？- 請叫我
- Excuse me? - Doctor.

910
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:46,650
霍夫斯德勒博士
Hoffstetler.

911
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,040
這是規矩
Protocol.

912
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,780
- 我之前在威斯康星大學麥迪遜分校 - 那就對了
- Wisconsin. Madison. - That's right.

913
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,270
你放棄了終身教職 對吧？
You gave up a tenure track position. Didn't you?

914
01:21:58,170 --> 01:21:59,120
為了我們
Gave it all up...

915
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,080
什麼都不要了
For us.

916
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:07,700
那麼 我想你現在已經準備好離開我們了 對嗎？
I suppose you're getting ready to leave us now, then, huh?

917
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:10,660
如果找不到那個生物的話 是的
Only if the creature isn't found.

918
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,400
你想什麼呢？ 你真以為我們能找到它？
What do you think? You think we will find it?

919
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,750
噢 你說過你們有進展了
Well, you said you had a lead.

920
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:21,070
確實
I do.

921
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,980
親愛的 你在傻笑什麼？
Why you smiling, hon?

922
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,410
別這副表情好嘛
Stop looking like that.

923
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,270
你倆幹嘛啦？
What happened?

924
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,290
怎麼可能？
Why?

925
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:27,900
他？
How?

926
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,010
他怎麼做到的？
How?

927
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:33,940
他他他他有那東西？
Does he? Have a?

928
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:40,630
這樣
Mmm.

929
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:43,330
再這樣打開 就長出來了嘛
Mmm.

930
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,310
永遠別以為男人很單純
Never trust a man.

931
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,100
即使他那裏光禿禿空蕩蕩平平無奇
Even when he looks flat down there.

932
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,260
請進

933
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,230
你的撤離文件...

934
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,200
他們快準備好了

935
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,730
首先 我有個問題

936
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:26,900
是嗎? 請問吧

937
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:29,730
你們想來點...

938
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:31,860
黃油蛋糕嗎?

939
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:33,130
好的 謝謝

940
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,300
你注射了...

941
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:41,630
那個研究對像之後

942
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,530
你怎麼處理屍體的?

943
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,300
我很好奇

944
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,730
我進行瞭解剖

945
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:55,800
沒什麼價值

946
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,500
列寧曾經說過

947
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:02,760
死魚是沒有價值的

948
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,660
列寧

949
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,360
說過這個?

950
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:20,530
蛋糕不錯！

951
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,160
你有牛奶嗎?

952
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,430
也許...

953
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:33,530
也許...

954
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:39,360
也許是...

955
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,700
你記錯了

956
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,430
等我們的回信

957
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,530
不會很久的

958
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,570
我剛報名參加了一個人類學課程
I just signed up in anthropology.

959
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:08,900
我們全班都要去亞馬遜雨林
We're gonna go have classes in the Amazon Jungle...

960
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,550
- 在南美洲 - 南美洲？
- in South America. - South America?

961
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:12,620
哦天哪 那可得大清早就出發
Oh man. You have to get off early in the morning

962
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:13,440
那地方很遠的
That's a long hike.

963
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,290
- 我們要待在那兒 - 我們？
- We're gonna stay down there. - We are?

964
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,050
哦 不 你該不會也要去吧
Oh no. You're not coming along too.

965
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:21,630
嘗嘗這個吉利丁凍糕
This is a gelatin parfait.

966
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:23,610
你會愛上這個味道的
You will love it.

967
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,290
《伯南扎的牛仔》：1959年首播，是美國第一部彩色西部連續劇

968
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,290
爸爸 我們能看《伯南扎的牛仔》嗎？
Dad, can we watch Bonanza?

969
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,660
那對你們來說太暴力了 你知道我今天在想什麼嗎？
Bonanza is much too violent. You know what I was thinking today?

970
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:29,990
我們帶著孩子
We get the kids a P-U-P-P...

971
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:24,220
怎麼回事？ 這水都涌進我的電影院啦
What is going on? I've got water pouring into my theater.

972
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:26,710
有四個付了錢的觀眾 我還得給他們退票
I have four paying customers. I can't afford a refund.

973
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,140
可能是某個管道的問題 我會處理的
It's probably a pipe. I'll take care of it.

974
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:30,170
- 修不好就別住這裏了 - 我會修好的
- If you don't fix it. No more renting. - I will fix it.

975
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:49,820
艾麗莎！
Elisa!

976
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,500
我的天哪！
Dear God!

977
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:53,580
艾麗莎！
Elisa!

978
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:24,990
我在擦乾我的頭髮
I'm toweling my hair.

979
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:27,380
我的頭髮！
It's my hair!

980
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:33,040
還有 看看我的手臂 那些傷口
And... and... look at the arm. The wound.

981
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:35,170
好像從來沒有過一樣 太神奇了
As if it was never there. Look at them.

982
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,390
你說過 人們把他當成神一樣供奉著
You said... He was worshipped like a god.

983
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:41,680
他是上帝嗎？ 我不這麼覺得 他可是吃了一隻貓
Is he a God? I don't look to him as a God. He ate a cat

984
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:43,570
哎 我真不知道
So I-I don't know! I don't know!

985
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:46,260
我們得讓他多留一陣子
We have to keep him around, awhile

986
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:48,690
就一陣子
A little while.

987
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:09,160
喂？
Hello?

988
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:11,100
撤離...

989
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,800
已經安排好了

990
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,130
老地方

991
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,960
四十八小時之後

992
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:20,260
四十八小時?

993
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,200
四十八小時

994
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:51,880
你的水 長官
Your water, Sir.

995
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,670
- 還有 長官 霍伊特將軍找你 - 不 別接通
- And, Sir, General Hoyt. - Uh-mm. Uh-mm.

996
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:59,100
告訴他我不在 我會打給他 總之別接進來
Tell him I'm not in, tell him I will call him back. Don't put him through.

997
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:02,410
不是來電 長官 他已經在你辦公室裏了
No, Sir. He's in your office.

998
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,780
現在我們唯一關心的就是那個研究對像
At this point our only concern is the asset.

999
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:09,910
你找到它了嗎？
Do you have it?

1000
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,780
還在找 長官
Still in the wind, sir.

1001
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:13,950
那可不好
That won't do.

1002
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:16,340
嗯 我知道
Yes sir. I know.

1003
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,450
你認識我多久了 長官？
You've know me for how long, Sir?

1004
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,570
- 十三年了 釜山戰役就認識了 - 是的 長官
- Thirteen years. Battle of Pusan. - Yes, sir.

1005
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,660
一個男人盡其一生都是有信仰 忠誠 做事高效的
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient all of his life. All of it

1006
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:31,390
還很有能力
And he is... useful.

1007
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,220
而他期望...
And he expects...

1008
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,430
他當然想要一定的回報
He has certain expectations in return.

1009
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:41,780
但是 他失敗了
And then... He fails.

1010
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,770
一次 僅此一次
Once. Only once.

1011
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:44,940
那會導致什麼？
What does that make?

1012
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:47,060
會讓他變成失敗者嗎？
Does that make him a failure?

1013
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:54,810
當一個男人完成任務 來證明他自己 將軍
When is a man done, Sir? Proving himself?

1014
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:56,870
他是一個好人
A good man.

1015
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,290
一個體面的人
A decent man.

1016
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:04,090
體面？
Decent?

1017
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,750
一個體面的人不會把事情搞砸
A man must have the decency not to fuck up.

1018
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:14,420
這是一種體面
That's one thing.

1019
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,110
真正的體面
That is real decent of him.

1020
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:21,250
另一種體面嘛 其實並不重要
The other kind of decency. It doesn't really matter.

1021
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,400
我們摒棄它 不是因為我們沒有這種品質
We sell it. But it's an export.

1022
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,730
而是因為它對我們沒用
We sell it 'cause we don't use it.

1023
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:33,440
36小時以後 這一切就結束了
36 hours from now, this entire episode will be over.

1024
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,700
你也一樣會完蛋
And so will you.

1025
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:42,510
我們的世界將會出現一個破洞
Our universe will have a hole in it with your outline.

1026
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,880
你會去另一個世界
And you will have moved on to an alternate universe.

1027
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,080
一個糟透了的世界
A universe of shit.

1028
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,700
你會被淹沒在那187A30B1里
You will be lost to civilization.

1029
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:00,740
未誕生
And you will be unborn.

1030
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:03,270
未成形
Unmade.

1031
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:06,800
未存在
Undone.

1032
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:16,290
所以 去掙些真正的體面吧 小伙子
So, go get some real decency, Son.

1033
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:19,310
然後收拾好這堆爛攤子
And unfuck this mess.

1034
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,300
36個小時
Thirty-six hours.

1035
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:58,270
36小時
Thirty-six hours.

1036
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:00,200
送快遞 你送快遞的！
Deliver. You deliver.

1037
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:02,070
你就是個送快遞的！
That's what you do. You deliver, right?

1038
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,380
對吧！
Right?!

1039
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,610
你
You'll...

1040
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,320
永遠
never...

1041
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:21,500
不會知道
know...

1042
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,990
我有多麼
Just how much...

1043
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,140
多麼
I've...

1044
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,870
愛
loved...

1045
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:32,490
你
you...

1046
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,380
你 永遠
You'll...

1047
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,340
不會知道
Never know...

1048
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,670
我有多麼
Just how much...

1049
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:49,180
♫ 在乎你 ♫
I care... 

1050
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,080
♫ 就算我不告訴你 ♫
And if I tried

1051
01:39:54,740 --> 01:40:02,480
♫ 我也沒法掩飾我對你的深情 ♫
I still couldn't hide my love for you.

1052
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,910
♫ 你得知道 ♫
You ought to know

1053
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:10,370
♫ 我只是不告訴你 ♫
For haven't I told you so

1054
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:25,750
♫ 你走了 把我的心也帶走了 ♫
You went away and my heart went with you

1055
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:36,260
♫ 我為你禱告 ♫
I speak your name in my every prayer

1056
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:44,220
♫ 我該怎麼向你證明  我有多麼愛你 ♫
If there is some other way to prove That I love you

1057
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:48,680
我無法向你訴說
I swear I don't know how.

1058
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:52,570
你不會明白的
You'll never know

1059
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:59,790
你怎麼會明白
If you don't know now

1060
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:20,620
艾麗莎
Elisa.

1061
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:24,470
怎麼啦 寶貝？
What is it, my honey?

1062
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:52,880
情況不妙啊
This isn't good.

1063
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:57,780
我要把霍夫斯德勒博士喊來了
I'm going to call Dr. Hoffstetler

1064
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,540
你今晚就得放走它了 寶貝
You got to release him tonight, honey.

1065
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:03,630
我會回來幫你的
I'll come back and help you.

1066
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:29,450
他要出來了
He's coming out.

1067
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:38,080
呃
Ugh.

1068
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:43,850
先生 恕我直言
Sir, If you don't mind me saying.

1069
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:45,560
您看起來不太好啊
You don't look so well.

1070
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,140
閉嘴
Shut up.

1071
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,390
你聞到了嗎
Can you smell that?

1072
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:55,540
是你的手指 都黑掉了
I think it's your fingers. They are black.

1073
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,500
哦他來了 狗屁博士
There he is, Doctor fucking shitbird.

1074
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,570
先生 你這說的太難聽了
There's no call for cursing, Sir.

1075
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,070
給我滾出來 這車歸我了
Get out of the car. I'm taking it.

1076
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,680
- 這是我的車 快他媽給我滾出去
- This is my car. - Get the fuck out.

1077
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,350
- 這可是我的車 - 你聽不見我說話嘛？
- Out of my car? - Did I stutter?

1078
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:08,330
真是傾盆大雨啊

1079
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,430
今天沒有暗號嗎?

1080
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,030
不要 不要 同志...

1081
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,700
不要...

1082
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:29,130
不要 求你了！

1083
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:58,820
- 哎媽 幸好 斯特裏克蘭 - 你又講俄語了 鮑勃
- Strickland, thank God! - You were speaking Russian, Bob.

1084
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,470
- 你叫什麼名字 - 霍夫斯德勒
- What's your name? - Hoffstetler.

1085
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:16,640
哎呀 這時候就沒必要說假話了
Oh no. Don't lie. You don't need to.

1086
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,680
你肚子上可是中了一槍
You took a bullet to your gut.

1087
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,100
你離死不遠了
You're dead.

1088
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,940
我要突擊隊裏所有人的名字 軍銜和藏身位置
I need the names, ranks and locations of the entire Strike Team.

1089
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:26,150
突擊隊？
Strike Team?

1090
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,480
搶走我們研究對象的那夥人
The ones that took the asset.

1091
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:42,760
這個糖 雖然很便宜 但我從小就愛死它了
This candy. It's cheap candy. I love it ever since I was a kid.

1092
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,830
有些人中意那些 看上去更高級的零食
Some folks favor more sophisticated snacks

1093
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:50,320
牛軋糖和那些破玩意兒
Nougat center and all that fu-fu shit.

1094
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,210
但我不喜歡
But not me, Bob.

1095
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:54,680
我就愛吃這個
This is it for me.

1096
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,780
我覺得緊張的時候
Now. Sometimes, if I'm feeling anxious

1097
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,300
我就大嚼一番
I just bite right into it

1098
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:05,120
但平時我還是會慢慢的
But mostly, I take my time.

1099
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,380
將它一點一點吃完
I make it last.

1100
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:16,530
他們的名字 編號和位置
Names, ranks and location of the strike team.

1101
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,280
名字 編號！給我快點！
Names! Ranks! Now!

1102
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,240
沒名字
No names

1103
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,950
沒編號
No ranks

1104
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:32,980
他們...
They...

1105
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:35,650
早就逃之夭夭了
They just clean.

1106
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:49,260
知道了布魯斯特 我會準備晚餐的
Alright Brewster. I'm gonna fix you dinner

1107
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,880
然後我要出去一下 去幫個朋友做點事
and then I'm going to run out for a little while and help a friend.

1108
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:55,930
- 做什麼事？- 就是幫朋友啦
- Help with what? - Helping a friend.

1109
01:46:58,480 --> 01:46:59,680
澤爾達
Zelda.

1110
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,250
門
Door.

1111
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,630
你他媽的連門都不能幫著開一下嗎
Well, You could well help me answer the door, Brewster!

1112
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,180
你就坐在離門十尺的地方！
You're sittin' right there just ten feet away from it.

1113
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,830
我背疼啊 婆娘 你去就是了
My back is acting up, woman. You move.

1114
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,760
背疼 背疼 你就知道背疼
Your back. Your back. Always your back.

1115
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:18,440
斯特裏克蘭先生！
Mr. Strickland!

1116
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:20,640
你怎麼在這？
What are you doing here?

1117
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:23,500
- 那個男人是誰？ - 它在哪？
- Who's that man, Zelda? - Where is it?

1118
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:25,010
- 你在說啥？- 你把它帶到哪兒去了？
- What are you talking about? - Where did you take it?

1119
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,150
澤爾達
Zelda.

1120
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:32,990
在實驗室裏
The thing in the lab.

1121
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:34,990
哪兒？
Where is it?

1122
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:36,900
- 什麼在哪裏？- 給我坐下！
- Where is what? - Sit down!

1123
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,630
哎呀先生我不是有意的
I'm sorry, Sir.

1124
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:50,010
要是我知道 我肯定會告訴你的
If I knew anything I would surely tell you.

1125
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,210
我還沒告訴你參孫的故事
That story about Samson.

1126
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:59,440
是如何結束的
I never told you how it ended.

1127
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:04,320
在非利士人狠狠折磨 還把他弄瞎了之後
After the Philistines torture him and blind him.

1128
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:08,780
於是他向上帝祈求力量
Samson asks God for the strength he needs

1129
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:12,860
就在最後一刻
And at the last minute, he is spared.

1130
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,960
上天
And the Lord...

1131
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,670
給予了他所要的力量
Gives him his strength back.

1132
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,680
最後一次
One last time.

1133
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:28,630
他抓住了神廟的柱子
And he holds the columns of the temple

1134
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:33,940
然後用他有力的胳膊把柱子推了個粉碎
with his powerful arms and crushes them

1135
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:48,570
整個廟都塌了 把非利士人也給埋了
And he brings the whole building down on the Philistines.

1136
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:59,970
他是死了 但他也把那些狗屁玩意兒全部操翻了
He dies. But he gets every single one of those motherfuckers.

1137
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,230
那就是他的願望
That is his will.

1138
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:07,330
現在
Now.

1139
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,780
你現在明白這個故事的意思了麼？
Do you know what that particular story means?

1140
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,870
對於我們來說 黛利拉
For us, Delilah

1141
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:16,580
它告訴我們 如果你有什麼瞞著我的話
It means that if you know something you're not telling me,

1142
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:19,720
你終究會告訴我的
you're gonna tell me. Either.

1143
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:22,240
無論是要等到我
Either before or after...

1144
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:25,530
把你家毀掉之前
I bring this particular temple...

1145
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:29,520
還是之後
down upon our heads.

1146
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:32,790
那個啞巴把它從實驗室偷走了
Gal stole that thing right out the lab!

1147
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:34,610
不管它是什麼
Whatever it is.

1148
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:36,400
你去找吧
You go took it.

1149
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:37,270
我聽我老婆
I heard my wife.

1150
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:39,420
打電話的時候講的
Talking on the phone about it.

1151
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:47,820
非常感謝你  富勒先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller for your assistance.

1152
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,560
- 你做了什麼? - 澤爾達!
- What have you done? - Zelda!

1153
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:04,520
我得提醒他們! 他去找她了
I got to warn her. He's going after her

1154
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:06,680
女人 你不許這樣做
You will do no such thing, Woman.

1155
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:09,720
你管她做什麼? 她犯法了
Why you worry about her? She broke the laws

1156
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,440
閉嘴  布魯斯特! 你閉嘴!
Shut up, Brewster! You shut up!

1157
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:14,390
這麼多年你一言不發
For years, you don't talk

1158
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:17,220
你可以繼續閉嘴了
and now you can't shut your mouth.

1159
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,500
去你丫的 布魯斯特!
Damn you Brewster!

1160
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,750
你不會明白的
You wouldn't understand.

1161
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:27,450
說什麼都沒用 你永遠明白不了的
You couldn't understand. Not if you tried your whole life

1162
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:31,240
- 嗨? - 吉爾斯 是你嗎?
- Hello? - Giles, that you?

1163
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:33,540
- 是的 - 讓艾麗莎接電話
- Yes. - Put Elisa on the phone.

1164
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:34,670
是澤爾達的電話
It's Zelda.

1165
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:39,150
艾麗莎 親愛的 如果你能聽見我的話  弄點聲音
Elisa, honey, make a sound in the phone if you can hear

1166
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:41,850
好
Okay, good.

1167
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:43,210
他去找你了
He's coming for you.

1168
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:45,700
你現在得走了 帶上那個東西
You got to go now and you go to take that thing with you.

1169
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,850
怎麼了? 艾麗莎!
What? Elisa!

1170
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,540
媽的
Dammit.

1171
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,230
我們得下車了!
We have to go!

1172
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:46,390
你在哪?
Where are you?

1173
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:48,990
你他媽的到底在哪?!
Where the fuck are you?!

1174
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,560
你好啊
That's nice.

1175
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,860
你

1176
01:53:02,730 --> 01:53:04,230
和我

1177
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:05,460
在一起

1178
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,360
在一起

1179
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,700
不 沒有我

1180
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:11,000
沒有我

1181
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:13,690
我從不會失手
I do not fail.

1182
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:17,540
我做到了
I deliver.

1183
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,130
艾麗莎!
Elisa!

1184
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:26,290
艾麗莎!
Elisa!

1185
01:54:35,060 --> 01:54:35,750
不
No.

1186
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:25,220
我的天
Fuck.

1187
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:29,010
你確實是個神
You are a God.

1188
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:37,000
關於她的故事
If I told you about it

1189
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:38,360
我要怎麼說呢
What would I say?

1190
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:41,520
說他們從此以後幸福的生活在一起?
That they lived happily ever after?

1191
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:44,290
我相信是這樣的
I believe it is.

1192
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:46,400
他們相愛
That they were in love

1193
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,020
永遠相愛
That they remained in love.

1194
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:50,440
我確定這是真的
I'm sure that's true.

1195
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:55,000
當我想起她時 想起艾麗莎...
But when I think of her, Elisa...

1196
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:59,220
只有一首詩 浮現在我的腦海
The only thing that comes to mind is a poem

1197
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,780
那是幾百年前一對情侶的甜言蜜語...
Whispered by someone in love, hundreds of years ago...

1198
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,380
「無法描述你的形狀」
「Unable to perceive the shape of You"

1199
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:10,940
「我感覺到你圍繞著我」
"I find You all around me."

1200
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:14,730
「因為你的存在 我滿眼都是你的愛意」
"Your presence fills my eyes with your love"

1201
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,570
「它讓我的心變的柔軟」
"It humbles my heart"

1202
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,450
「你無處不在」
"For you are everywhere"
