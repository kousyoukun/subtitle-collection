1
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,754
若要我提及此事
If I spoke about it. 

2
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:53,991
若真的要我說
If I did.

3
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:57,004
我又該和你說些什麼呢
What would I tell you?

4
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:59,029
讓我想想
I wonder?

5
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:03,272
我該告訴你故事發生的時間嗎
Would I tell you about the time?

6
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,115
我感覺 這是在很久以前了
It happened a long time ago- It seems...

7
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,538
當時 一位可敬的王子統治著一切
In the last days of a fair Prince's reign...

8
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:13,643
或者 我該告訴你故事發生的地方嗎
Or would I tell you about the place?

9
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,324
那是海岸邊的一座小城市
A small city near the coast

10
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,061
與世隔絕
but far from everything else...

11
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,710
要不
Or, I don't know.

12
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,761
我跟你講講她吧
Would I tell you about her?

13
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,318
那位失聲的公主
The princess without voice

14
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,116
還是說 我來講講
Or perhaps I would just warn you

15
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,060
這個故事背後的真相
about the truth of these facts

16
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,647
一個愛與失的故事
and the tale of love and loss

17
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,662
還有那隻野獸
and the monster

18
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:49,144
那只曾試圖毀滅一切的野獸
that tried to destroy it all...

19
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,170
親愛的荷達大人
My Lord Hedak.

20
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,893
你有什麼煩心事嗎
So, you are troubled.

21
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:47,502
跟我說說吧
Tell me.

22
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:50,887
我已是
I have...

23
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,195
我已是有罪之身
I have sinned.

24
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:54,905
我觸犯了神明
I've offended the god.

25
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,451
我深陷在我的罪惡中 荷達大人
I'm deep in sin, my Lord Hedak.

26
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,296
你說出來 讓我做出決斷
Let me judge of that.

27
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,017
我曾質疑獻祭的儀式
I've doubted the ceremony of the sacrifice.

28
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,358
是警笛把你吵醒的嗎
Did the sirens wake you up?

29
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,807
是一場大火 巧克力工廠
It was a fire. The chocolate factory.

30
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,713
你聞到了嗎 哦 天啊
You smell that? Oh my...

31
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,589
烤可可
Toasted cocoa.

32
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,193
悲劇與喜悅 攜手撲面而來
Tragedy and delight-- Hand in hand.

33
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:49,605
哦 我親愛的孩子
Oh dear child.

34
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,133
如果沒有你的照顧的話 我應該早就昏死過去了
I'd waste away if you weren't here looking after me.

35
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,602
我就是那種時時刻刻需要受到照顧的人 看看這個
I am the proverbial starving. Watch this.

36
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,789
現代踢踏舞 樓梯間的舞蹈
Bojangles, the stair dance.

37
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,259
很難跳
That's so hard.

38
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,174
卡格尼會跳 跳得不一樣但是也美
Cagney did it. Different but beautiful.

39
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:08,160
我也想跳
I want to do that too.

40
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,717
好啊 你準備好了嗎
All right. Are you ready?

41
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,052
-是的 -來吧
- Yep. - Come on.

42
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,498
伊萊莎
Elisa.

43
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:00,404
下次你要交房租的時候
Next time you're going to bring the rent,

44
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,521
我希望你能留下來看看這部聖經電影 怎麼樣
I want you to stay and see the bible movie, huh.

45
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,489
我這 我這兒有兩張免費的票
I got... I got two free tickets here.

46
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,038
帶上你的鄰居查爾斯一起來看 他是個好孩子
You bring your neighbor Charles. He's a good boy.

47
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:11,174
想看喜劇電影嗎 現在都沒人來影院看電影了
Find a movie in comedy? Nobody's coming to the theater, huh.

48
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:14,232
我可以給你送免費的爆米花和飲料噢
I can throw you a free popcorn and soda.

49
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,015
哦 不 天哪 應該是「節」
Oh no, for God's sake! There's two "S' there.

50
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:21,135
拜託 是「節」 狂歡節 不是狂歡街
Come on. Two "S". Mardi Grass. Mardi Grass.

51
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:34,908
伊萊莎 快點 快來 快來
Elisa, come on. Come here already!

52
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:37,996
-你得準時點啊 -嘿 你在幹什麼
- You gotta learn to be on time. - Hey, what you doing?

53
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,485
-你不能插隊啊 -你就放過她吧
- Don't cut in, Dummy. - Leave her alone, woman.

54
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,625
我給她留了位置了
I was keepin' her place.

55
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,149
我要去報告 我要去舉報你和那個啞巴
I get reported. I come after you and the mute.

56
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,843
去吧 尤蘭達
You do that, Yolanda.

57
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:47,331
有種你就去吧
You do that.

58
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,709
我的腳疼死了
My feet are already killin' me.

59
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:06,624
今晚走之前 我給布魯斯特做了小熱狗吃
I made Brewster pigs in the blanket tonight before leavin'.

60
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,326
他吃得乾乾淨淨的
Boy, he just ate 'em up.

61
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:14,072
沒有一句謝謝 沒有一句好吃 連看都不看一眼
No thank-yous, no yum-yums, not a peep-

62
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,973
男人就像墳墓一樣沉默
Man is silent as the grave.

63
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,107
如果放個響屁算是對你奉承的話
But if farts were flattery

64
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,705
親愛的 那他可算是莎士比亞了
Honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

65
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:25,093
之後我回到家 為他做早飯
Then I get home and I make him breakfast.

66
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,749
雞蛋 培根 塗好黃油的吐司
Eggs, bacon and buttered toast.

67
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:29,611
我為這個男人的吐司塗黃油
I butter the man's toast,

68
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,608
伊萊莎 兩邊都塗了 像個孩子一樣照顧他
Elisa. Both sides-As if he was a child...

69
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,459
但我連句謝謝都聽不到
And I don't even get a thank you

70
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,070
你肯定心存感激 因為你受過教育
You'd be grateful, because you are an educated woman.

71
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,254
但是我的布魯斯特 他僅有的優點
But my Brewster, all he had

72
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:42,624
就是他當年那無法抵擋的魅力
gone for him was animal magnetism back in the day

73
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,420
我就被迷得神魂顛倒
And workin' awhile.

74
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:47,382
這亂糟糟的算什麼事
What in the same hell?

75
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:48,557
盧
Lou!

76
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,525
你們就不會乖乖地把垃圾扔到垃圾桶裡嗎
You boys mind puttin' the trash in the can?

77
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:51,752
那是垃圾桶的正確用處
That's what it's that for.

78
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,601
很難相信 是吧 那就是垃圾桶的正確用途
Hard to believe, uh? That's what it's that for.

79
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:56,999
好吧 好吧 抱歉 澤爾達
Alright. Alright. Sorry Zelda,

80
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,675
-抱歉 -我不知道他們在幹什麼
-sorry. - I don't know what they're doin'.

81
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,906
整天弄得亂糟糟的 真是
Makin' a goddamn mess, in what I'd say.

82
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:04,115
-澤爾達 別再發牢騷了 -是的 長官
- Zelda, stop the chatting please. - Yes sir.

83
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:07,825
- 不就髒了點嗎 沒必要大呼小叫的 - 抱歉 弗萊明先生
- There's no call for the blaspheme. - Sorry, Mr. Fleming.

84
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:11,915
耽誤你們一點時間
A moment of your time.

85
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,038
今天 我們T-4實驗室將迎來一支新的團隊 還有我們新的研究項目
Today, we are receiving a new team and asset here in T-4.

86
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:18,837
這位是羅伯特·霍夫施塔特博士
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler,

87
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,421
他從我們加爾維斯頓總部遠道而來
from our system facility in Galveston.

88
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:25,620
我不想誇誇而談他們有多厲害 但是
Now, I don't want to bolster or overstate the matter but uh

89
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,947
我相信他們所帶來的研究項目 將會是我們
this may very well be the most sensitive asset

90
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,364
這裡最寶貴的財富
ever to be housed in this facility

91
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,793
-一路還算順利吧 -還好
- How was your trip? - Fine.

92
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:54,293
-誰是這兒的安保 -請稍等一下
- Who's security here? - Just one moment please.

93
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:00,639
-安保 誰是這兒的安保 -長官 歡迎來到T4實驗室
-Security. Who's security here? - Welcome to T-4, sir.

94
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:04,904
是的 長官 我叫弗萊明 是這裡的安保組長
Yes, sir. I am Flemington, Head of Security...

95
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:35,881
讓他們出去
Get them out.

96
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:39,633
幫我把這個氣缸放到壓縮器裡
Help me move the cylinder into the compressor!

97
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,194
把它搬過來 搬過來
Bring it here. Bring it here.

98
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,075
伊萊莎 伊萊莎 咱們走
Elisa! Elisa, come on.

99
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,735
他們到底在搞些什麼 你有看到嗎
What goes on in this place? Did you see that?

100
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:24,127
是啦 我做了接發 又怎樣呢
Yes, I'm wearing the hair piece. How's is it look like?

101
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,496
小心車
Careful of the car.

102
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,851
又不是那種女性假髮 這是接發
It's not a hair piece. It's a toupee.

103
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:34,851
永久性的 知道嗎
It's eternal, see?

104
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:37,454
坦塔羅斯從未逃過死亡之爪
Tantalus never achieved the escape of death.

105
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:41,569
枝頭上的果實 恰好就在他夠不到的地方
There's a fruit on the branches was just always out of his reach.

106
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,381
溪流中的水源
And the water in the stream

107
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:45,407
每當他彎下腰要去喝時 就枯竭了
receded every time he stooped down to drink.

108
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:48,452
這就是為什麼我們如今會說
And so that's why we say things today like

109
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,639
看看那些坦塔羅斯(誘人)的派
Look at those tantalizing pies.

110
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,327
多謝塞 你地會再來的吧
Thank you, ya'll come back, y'heah?

Yes, pies for breakfast! Just trust me on this.

I've seen you here before, right?

114

是的 其實我已經來過這裡好幾次了
Yes, I've been here a couple of times as a matter of fact.

115

Just go with it, please.

118
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:19,020
啊 我呀 我想我已經快上癮了
Uh. I-uh. It's a craving I indulge in.

119
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:22,073
可能對我的健康無益 有什麼東西上癮後對身體有益呢
It can't possibly be good for me. Nothing that I like is...

120
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,039
不是噢 這個派很讚的 酸橙
No, no. It's a mighty fine pie, key lime.

121
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,849
你不會就是著名的迪克西·道格本人吧
You would happen to be the famous Dixie Doug himself, huh?

122
00:13:27,878 --> 00:13:30,521
甘是不是啦 他的派到處都有賣嘎
Heck, no. Pies are trucked throughout the country.

123
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,875
-他們叫這個 加咩啊 特許經營 -噢
-They call it uh, franchising. See? - Oh.

124
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,976
佢地給我地嘀攪拌機 同埋標識
They give us the spinners, the signage.

125
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:36,631
那個是派小子 我地的吉祥物
That there's pie boy. Our mascot.

126
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,203
其實我一般不這麼講話的
I don't talk like that.

127
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,876
-我是北方人 -不是吧
- I'm from Ottawa. - No.

128
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:43,787
我差點就信了
I completely bought it.

129
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:47,001
這派賊棒
That's-a-great-a-pie

130
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:47,637
那個 那個小個子男人 他是意大利人嗎
The.. The Little guy. Is he supposed to be Italian?

131
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,717
我想是的
I guess so.

132
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:58,345
很聰明的營銷策略
That was very clever.

133
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,982
你地會再來的吧
Y'all come back now, y'heah?

134
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:07,351
你地會再來的
Y'all come back now

135
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:07,751
你覺得他說的是真的嗎
Do you think he meant it?

136
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,662
你也聽到啦 他注意到我了
He had noticed me. You heard that.

137
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,940
這個派太膩了
This pie is rather sordid.

138
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:25,129
別吐出來啊 下次我們試試別的口味吧
Don't spit it out. Next time we go, well try different flavor.

139
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,741
以後再吃
Save it for later.

140
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:46,336
天哪 換掉那個頻道 我不想看
Dear God, change that awfulness. I do not want to see that.

141
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:49,294
我不想看這個
I do not want to see it.

142
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,554
這就好多了 好多了
That's better. That's better.

143
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,150
噢 看看貝蒂
Oh. Look at Betty!

144
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,701
噢 年輕又美麗
Oh. To be young and beautiful

145
00:14:59,075 --> 00:14:59,965
如果我能回去
If I could go back,

146
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,079
回到十八歲的時候
to when I was eighteen

147
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,071
那時我什麼都不知道
I didn't know anything about anything.

148
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:05,369
我會給自己一點建議
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

149
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:11,119
我會說 好好照顧你的牙齒 還有 盡情做愛
I would say. Take better care of your teeth and fuck-a lot more.

150
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:13,538
那真是很好的建議
That's very good advice.

151
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,405
#我可愛的小寶貝#
# Pretty baby of mine. #

152

#我可愛的小寶貝#
# Pretty baby of mine. #

153
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,551
瞧瞧啊
Will you look at this?

154
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,697
聽我說
Look.

155
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,999
我們國家裡最聰明的人
Some of the best minds in our country

156
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,957
在廁所都能尿得到處都是

157
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:15,992

Mh-mh-mhm.

158
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,336
連天花板上都有尿痕
There's pee freckles on the ceiling!

159

他們怎麼弄上去的
How do they get it up there?

160
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,707
你覺得他們要多大的尿盆才不會尿出來
Just how big a target do they need, you figure?

161
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,285
他們都這麼大了 肯定也有不少經驗了
They get enough practice that's for sure.

162
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,200
我的布魯斯特
My Brewster,

163
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:35,841
沒人說過他是什麼聰明人
no one ever called him a great mind,

164
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:36,955
但是
but...

165
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,889
就算是他啊 他也有七成的幾率能尿到池裡
even he... Man he just hits the can seventy percent of the time.

166
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:50,082
-抱歉 先生 -不 不 沒事的 繼續吧
- Excuse us, sir. - No, no, no. That's alright. Go ahead.

167
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,264
你們女士們好像聊得很開心呀
You ladies seem to be chatting enjoyably.

168
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,313
肯定是女生間的悄悄話
Girl talk no doubt.

169
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,631
不用管我
Don't mind me.

170
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,378
伊萊莎
Elisa...

171
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:13,654
聽著 別碰它
Look, don't touch.

172
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:16,706

弗萊明的安保人員

177
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:36,003
哦 不 不用了 一個男人
Oh no, no. A man washes his

178
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:39,422
方便前洗手還是方便後洗手
hands before or after tending to his needs.

179
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,132
能透露出他很多的信息
That tells you a lot about that man.

180
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:44,253
如果他方便前後都洗手的話
If he does it both times,

181
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,516
說明他這個人肯定有致命的弱點
Points to a weakness in character.

182
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:51,859
女士們

183
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:57,297
很高興能和你們二位聊天
It was very pleasant chatting with you both.

184
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,605
個兒矮的人都很刻薄
Short people are mean.

185
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,486
我就沒見過一個一直以善意待人的小個子
I've never met a short man that stays nice all the way through.

186
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:28,303
一個個 都是在別人背後說壞話的小混蛋
No, sir, mean little backstabbers, all of 'em.

187
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:32,908
也許是這裡的空氣的原因吧 氧氣不夠什麼的
Maybe it's the air down there, not enough oxygen or somethin.

188
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,798
來人啊 他在流血
Help! He's losing blood!

189
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,600

你覺得是俄國人闖進來了嗎 應該不是吧
You think the Russians broke in? I don't think so.

191
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,379
如果真的是他們的話 杜恩的手下應該會把他們都搞定了吧
And If they did, Duane's meatloaf will kill them all, honey.

192
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:19,288
有兩聲槍響 你聽到了嗎
It was two shots, you hear 'em?

193
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,639
對 三聲 還有那聲尖叫
Alright three, and that scream.

194
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,363
這裡到底怎麼了
Whatever happens in this place?

195
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,064
你們倆 跟我來
You two. Come with me.

196
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:28,527
現在嗎 弗萊明先生

Oh heavens to Betsy. We're in a pickle. We're in such a pickle.

200
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,767
你們只有二十分鐘時間
You will have exactly twenty minutes,

201
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,394
要把實驗室搞得乾乾淨淨的
to render this-this lab immaculate and so on and so forth.

202
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:55,615
二十分鐘
Twenty minutes.

203
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,015
一大攤血啊
It's a lot of blood.

204
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,712
老娘能搞定尿 能搞定屎
I can handle piss, I can handle poop...

205
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:10,327
但是血咧 血就很難搞定了
But blood? Mmm. Blood is just something to me.

206
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,879
親愛的 給 幫我把這兒拖乾淨
Here Hon, help me mop it up.

207

我們越早離開這兒越好
The sooner we get out of here the better.

208
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:34,138
噢天哪
Oh!

209
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,148
一根手指
It's a finger!

210
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,186
兩根手指
It's two fingers!

211
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:42,482
好 好 就把它們放到一邊 在這兒等我
Okay, okay. Put 'em away and just wait here.

212
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,969
我去跟弗萊明說
I'm gonna get this to Fleming.

213
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,027
那些殘肢在哪兒呢
Where are these body parts?

214
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,504
殘肢呢
The body parts?

215
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,825
不 我相信你 親愛的 你確定它還活著嗎
No, I believe you, honey. Are you sure you it was alive?

216
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,924
因為我以前在馬戲團見過所謂的美人魚
Because I saw a mermaid once in a carnival tent.

217
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,781
只是隻猴子
And it was a monkey sewn

218
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:39,276
綁上了魚尾 看起來挺真的
to the tail of a fish. Looked real to me.

219
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,797
好吧 我道歉
Alright, I apologized.

220

我截稿期限要到了
I have a deadline

221
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:45,568
你知道嗎
You know uh...

222
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,642
玉米片是為了防止手淫而發明的
Corn Flakes were invented to prevent masturbation.

223
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,961
但並沒成功
It didn't work.

224
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,101
哦 愛麗絲·菲耶的節目要開始了
Oh, Alice Faye just started...

225
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:58,843
她以前是個巨星
She was a huge star, huge.

226
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,886
直到有一天她實在受不了娛樂圈的那些花言巧語
And one day she couldn't take the bullshit,

227
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:01,939
那些卑鄙小人
the backstabbing anymore

228
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:04,597
她就索性離開娛樂圈
and she just walked away from everything.

229
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:08,660
看看 當做次品來看的話 也還不錯吧
Ta-da! It's not bad, is it? For being shit?

230
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:13,405
聽著 你就乖乖吃飯 睡覺 休息
Huh, listen. You eat, you go to bed, you rest.

231
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:16,477
等我拿到報酬
And when I get paid...

232
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:24,249
我們就有派吃了 不 不是我們
We get pie! No, we don't get pie.

-他們現在希望主調是綠色的 -但他們之前告訴我是紅色的
- They want the gelatin to be green now. - But I was told red.

241
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:04,832
新概念 綠色才是未來的主色調
New concept. That's the future, now.

242
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:05,697
綠色

243
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:09,191
噢 他們還想這家人看起來開心點
Oh. And they want them happier- the family.

244
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:11,130
-開心點 -開心點是什麼意思
-Happier. - Happier?

245
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:13,462
這父親已經夠開心了 他看起來像是解鎖了什麼新體位一樣
The Father looks like he just discovered the missionary position

246
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:14,081
賈爾斯
Giles.

247
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,257
好吧 那他們應該為什麼開心呢
Well uh... What would they supposed to be happy about?

248
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,120
我想要像照片一樣逼真的作品 我答應他們的
I want the photographs. I sold them on this

249
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,536
-確實可惜這幅畫了 還是很好看的 -確實很好 對吧
- It's too bad-this is nice work. - It is nice, isn't it?

250
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,266
我覺得這是我最好的作品之一
I think it's one of my best.

251
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:28,367
最近過得還不錯吧

You get any work since you left Klein & Saunders?

254
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,324
你是說 我被你開除後吧
You mean since I was asked to leave by you.

255
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:39,671
我們現在最好不要談這個
We're not gonna get into this now.

256
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:42,123
我想回來工作 伯尼

268
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,371
沒有 長官
No, sir...

269
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,422
這並不常見吧 對你們黑人來說
That's not common, is it? For your people?

270
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:42,797
我媽媽在我之後就去世了
My momma died after me.

271
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,332
我出生以後
After I was born.

272
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:49,723
名字裡的迪是什麼意思
What does the D stand for?

273
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:52,853
迪萊拉 長官
Delilah, Sir.

274
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,649
根據聖經取的
On account of the bible.

275
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,913
迪萊拉 她背叛了參孫
Delilah. She betrayed Samson.

276
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:00,101
引誘他入睡 剪掉他的頭髮
Lull him to sleep, cut his hair.

277
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,292
非利士人折磨他 羞辱他
Philistines torture him, humiliate him-

278
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,527
把他的雙眼都給燒了
Burn his eyes out.

279
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,273
看來我媽媽讀書讀得不夠仔細啊
I guess my momma didn't read the good book close enough

280
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:11,203
你呢
And you?

281
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,735
伊萊莎·埃斯波西托
Elisa Esposito.

282
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,626
埃斯波西托是孤兒的意思嗎
Doesn't Esposito means Orphanage?

283
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,263
我們這位來自普特南的索羅孤兒院的女士
Our Lady of Sorrows Orphanage in Putnam.

284
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:23,369
他們是在河邊發現她的
They found her by the river in the water.

285
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:28,102
是你 發現了我的手指嗎
It was you... that found my fingers?

286
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:31,719
噢 謝謝你
Oh! Thanks.

287
00:27:32,757 --> 00:27:34,130
我在急診室裡呆了三個小時
Three hours in surgery.

288
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,773
他們重建了趾骨 這裡 縫合了筋腱
They rebuilt the first phalanx, here, sutured the tendons.

289
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:41,150
也不知道這會不會成功
Don't know if it's going to take it or not.

290
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:43,221
上面還有芥末
There was mustard on them.

291
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:46,135
-一個紙袋 -我們當時只有那個 長官
-A paper bag. - It was all we had, Sir.

292
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:49,079
我回答大多數問題 是因為 她說不了話
I answer mostly, on account that she can't talk.

293
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:51,454
說不了話 她聾了嗎
She can't? Is she deaf?

294
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:53,692
啞了 長官
Mute, sir.

295
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,533
她說她能聽見你
She said she can hear you.

296
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,628
你脖子上的傷疤
All those scars on your neck.

297
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:06,764
是你的聲帶被割壞時留下的嗎
That's what that it cut your voice box, right?

298
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,591
她說從她嬰兒時期就有了
She said since she was a baby.

299
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,321
誰會對一個嬰兒這麼狠啊
Who would do that to a baby?

300
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:15,667
世界是充滿罪惡的 你說呢 迪萊拉
The world is sinful. Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

301
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,891
好了 我就直說吧
Well, let me say this upfront.

302
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,955
你們打掃實驗室 完工就出來
You clean that lab. You get out.

303
00:28:22,474 --> 00:28:25,077
那裡面的東西是你們惹不起的
The thing we keep in there, is an affront.

304
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:27,134
你知道惹不起是什麼意思吧 澤爾達
Do you know what an affront is, Zelda?

305
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,216
它具有攻擊性
Something offensive?

306
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:31,908
沒錯 我早該知道的 我把那個
That's right. And I should know, I've dragged that...

307
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,115
髒東西
...filthy thing

308
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,694
大老遠從南美的泥沙弄回來
out of the river muck in South America all the way here

309
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:42,741
這一路我們倆過得都挺遭罪的
And along the way we didn't get to like each other much.

310
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:45,977
好吧
Now.

311
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:50,761
你們可能覺得 那東西看起來像人
You may think... that thing looks human

312
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,816
能雙腳直立行走 是吧
Stands on two legs, right?

313
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,790
但是 我們是按造物主的樣子創造出來的
But... we're created in the Lord's image.

314
00:28:58,782 --> 00:29:00,758
你們該不會覺得造物主就長那模樣吧
You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?

315
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,694
長官 我可不知道造物主長什麼樣
I wouldn't know, Sir. What the Lord looks like.

316
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,647
呃 人樣 澤爾達 造物主長人樣 像我這樣
Well, human, Zelda. He looks like a human, like me.

317
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,000
或甚至像你那樣
Or even you.

318
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,219
我猜可能更像我一點吧
Maybe a little more like me, I guess.

319
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:16,550
好了 你們出去吧
Well, that's all.

320
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:22,102
霍伊特將軍 感謝您的回電 長官
General Hoyt. Thank you for calling me back, Sir.

321
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,135
-你好一點了嗎 -噢是的長官 好多了
- You feel better? - Oh yes, Sir. Much better.

322
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:25,492
止痛藥的功勞
Pain pills, is all.

323
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,327
-斷了兩根手指是嗎
- You lost two fingers. Was it?

324
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:29,138
沒錯 他把我兩根手指咬下來了
- Two fingers yeah. He got two fingers.

325
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,916
大拇指 食指 中指都還在呢
But I still got my thumb, my trigger and my pussy finger

326
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:35,767
-聽起來你狀態挺好的 -是的 長官 沒什麼大問題
- Sounds to me like you'll be all right. - Yes, sir, that's right.

327
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:37,646
期待您的光臨 長官
Looking forward to your visit, Sir.

328
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:40,293
關於這個東西的處置還有待商討
Decisions need to be made about the asset.

329
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,609
能到達樸次茅斯市中心的任何位置
...free to locations on Downtown Portermouth.

330
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,363
未來就在這裡
The Future is here.

331
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:24,079
去休息吧
Get to rest.

332
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:27,285
九點半來接我
Pick me up on 9:30.

333
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:29,549
二十一點三十分 沒問題 長官
Twenty one hundred and thirty hours. Yes, Sir.

334
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,051
你值得擁有
...that's great to buy.

335
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,776
我回來了
I'm home.

336
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:37,125
我給你做了煎蛋卷哦
I made you an omelet!

337
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,337
-嘿 老爸 你猜怎麼著 -沒有薄餅嗎
- Hey Dad! Guess what? - No pancakes?

338
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:41,181
我已經拆了一大半這些箱子 就是找不到烤盤
I've gone half through the boxes. I can't find the griddle...

339
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:42,885
-我給你做了奶酪和西蘭花薄餅 -你猜怎麼著
I made you cheese and broccoli omelette, - Guess what?

340
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:44,227
感覺怎麼樣 還疼嗎
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

341
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:46,457
-還有點 止痛藥挺管用的 -你猜怎麼著
- A little bit. Pills help. - Guess what?

342
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,866
-怎麼了 -我們在新學校埋了一個時空膠囊
- What? - We're burying a time capsule, at the new school.

343
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,303
我本來想問你
I wanted to ask you.

344
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,699
我們在未來有沒有可能都能擁有噴氣飛行器
Do you think we'll all have jet packs, in the future?

345
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,443
-會有的 兒子 -校車來了
-Believe it son. - Bus is here.

346
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:01,263
這裡可是美國
This is America.

347
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,006
爸爸再見
Bye dad!

348
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:09,863
把煎蛋卷吃完
Finish your omelet and wash

349
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:12,063
洗淨淨你的手手 然後上樓來 親愛的
your hands real good and come upstairs, Sweetie.

350
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:13,864
我挺喜歡這裡的
I kinda like it here.

351
00:31:14,126 --> 00:31:15,672
孩子們很喜歡這裡的草坪
The kids like the lawn. Plus,

352
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,753
而且華盛頓離這也就半小時的路程 你覺得呢
DC is just half an hour away, isn't it?

353
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,868
巴爾的摩就是巴爾的摩 伊萊恩 沒人喜歡巴爾的摩
It's still Baltimore, Elaine. No one likes Baltimore.

354
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,322
你知道嗎
You know what I'm thinking?

355
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:32,017
我想 我需要一輛新車了
I'm thinking. I need a new car.

356
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:40,856
你需要輛新車 是嗎
Do you need a new car, do you?

357
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,362
來輛凱迪拉克怎麼樣呢 先生
How about a Cadillac, Mr.?

358
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:46,510
理查德

359
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:47,939

Silence.

365
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:05,567
安靜
Silence.

366
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:09,702
窗台上的麻雀窩
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

367
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,345
什麼
- What?

368
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:15,767
窗台上的麻雀窩
The sparrow nests on the window sill.

369
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:18,168
老鷹把獵物抓走了
And the eagle takes the prey.

370
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:18,869
什麼
- What?

371
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:51,567

- You're doing it again, Zelda. - Oh. Give it a rest, Yolanda!

375

嘿 澤爾達 來一口嗎
- Hey, Zelda, you want to smoke?

376
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:03,432
那玩意對你可不好 杜恩
- That shit's ain't good for you, Duane.

377
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:04,675

C'mon. C'mon. C'mon

381

不用擔心監控攝像頭
Don't worry about that camera.

382
00:39:13,138 --> 00:39:14,732
休息時間 監控錄像都是關掉的
We push them off on break time.

383
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:16,781
嗯哼
Uh-mm

384
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:18,438
這裡是盲區
This here's a blind spot.

385
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,692
我要在這裡做點準備工作
I may have to finish some things in here,

386
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:49,994
你們去接將軍
fetch the General, will ya?

387
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:06,369
噢 想我了嗎
Oh. You miss me, huh?

388
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,375
我帶了方糖
I took a candy break.

389
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,813
是這個玩意兒嚇到你了吧 哈
This is what scares you, huh?

390
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:17,725
天哪 你也該習慣了吧
Jeez, be used to it by now.

391
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:23,716
又來了 發出這麼難聽的聲音
There you go again. Making that god-awful sound.

392
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,389
是你的哭聲嗎 哈 你就這樣哭的嗎
Is that you crying, huh? Is that what it is?

393
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:28,461
很難過吧 哈
Are you hurting? Huh?

394
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:31,439
還是你在生氣呢
Or maybe you're angry?

395
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,136
是不是想再咬我一口
Maybe you'd like to get another bite at me.

396
00:40:34,328 --> 00:40:35,311
哈 來呀
Huh? Go ahead.

397
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:40,456
我搞不懂了
I can't tell.

398
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,528
你這是在求我嗎
Are you begging?

399
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:48,224
在我聽來這是他媽最難聽的聲音了
'Cause to me it's just the worst fucking noise I've ever heard.

400
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:20,923
伊萊莎
Elisa?

401
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:22,908
伊萊莎
Elisa!

402
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,365
霍伊特將軍 歡迎 長官
General Hoyt! Welcome, Sir!

403
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:38,468
一切準備就緒了 很高興您能來 長官
Everything's ready. Glad to have you here, Sir!

404
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,329
-很高興見到你 孩子 -謝謝您
- Good to see you, son. - Thank you.

405
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,638
老天爺喲 就是這東西嗎
Good God Almighty, Is that it?

406
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,751
比我想的大多了
A lot bigger than I thought.

407
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:45,987
醜得不行
Ugly as sin.

408
00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:49,741
你知道嗎 亞馬遜原住民把他當神來供奉
You know, the natives in the Amazon worshipped it as a God.

409
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,265
現在這個鬼樣子 可不像什麼神靈啊
It doesn't look like much of a God now, does it?

410
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:55,647
長官 你也知道啦 他們都是群野蠻人 整天往水裡扔點花花果果
Well, they were primitive, Sir. You know they tossed offerings

411
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:58,114
就當作貢品了
into the water, flowers, fruits, crap like that.

412
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:01,435
還試著用自己的弓箭來阻止我們鑽取石油
Then they tried to stop the oil drill with bows and arrows.

413
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,847
簡直是螳臂擋車嘛
That didn't turn out too well.

414
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:04,292
他在流血 你做了什麼
He's bleeding. What happened?

415
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:06,848
你做了什麼
What happened?

416
00:42:07,018 --> 00:42:09,046
它是個動物 霍夫施塔特 我只是想馴服它
- It's an animal, Hoffstetler. Just keeping it tame.

417
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:11,011
氧氣滲透 二氧化碳轉化
Oxygen osmosis and dioxide exchange.

418
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:12,510
-這些數據什麼意思 -這個生物 長官
What the hell we got here, Son? - This creature, Sir

419
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:16,977
他能隨意切換
It can alternate between

420
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:19,092
兩套完全分離的呼吸系統
two entirely separate breathing mechanisms.

421
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:21,319
-彈塗魚也能啊 -不
- Mudskipper can do that. - No.

422
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:24,570
是這樣的 你想送人去太空上的話
Look. You want to put a man in space.

423
00:42:24,832 --> 00:42:25,953
他們必須得承受
He's gonna have to endure

424
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:28,062
正常人類所不能承受的自然條件
conditions the human body just wasn't made for.

425
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,516
這是我們對付蘇聯的利器啊
This gives us an edge against the Soviets.

426
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:33,463
他能在空氣中呼吸多久
How long can it breathe outside the water?

427
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,578
長官 現在情況就是 我們對這個鬼東西一無所知
Reality, is, Sir. We don't know jackshit about this thing.

428
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:41,494
我們只知道蘇聯也想把這東西拿到手
Well, the Soviets want it. We know that much.

429
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:43,168
那些鬥雞眼的雜種
Those cockeyed bastards.

430
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:45,152
他們讓蘇聯人把狗送上太空
You know, they let them send

431
00:42:45,153 --> 00:42:47,229
我們一笑而過
a dog up in the space and we get a good laugh.

432
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:49,671
你還沒反應過來 他們已經把人送上太空了
Then next thing you know, they send a human up.

433
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:53,120
一個俄國佬 繞著我們地球轉 鬼知道他們想幹些什麼
A Ruskie, orbiting our planet, doing God knows what?

434
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,678
現在誰笑得出來 赫魯曉夫
Who's laughing now? Krushchev.

435
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:58,789
就是這樣 我們讓他送條狗上太空
That's it. We let him put a dog in space,

436
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,984
他笑 送一個共產黨上太空
he laughs, puts a commie in space

437
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,627
他笑 還把導彈送到古巴
he laughs, puts missiles in Cuba.

438
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:05,543
我們就不能長點記性嗎
Have we learned nothing?

439
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:07,545
長官 我們得把他放回水裡了
Sir. We need to get him back in the water

440
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,721
你看這些科學家 像藝術家一樣
See this Scientist, they are like artists.

441
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:11,556
和自己的小玩具陷入愛河了
They fall in love with their playthings.

442
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,114
來 看到這裡了嗎 中間這一條
Now, right here-you see? Along the middle?

443
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,426
這玩意有粗粗的關節軟骨
This creature has a thick jointed

444
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,184
把他的第一個和第二個肺分開了
cartilage separating the primary and secondary lungs.

445
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:20,942
我解釋得對嗎 鮑勃
Am I explaining this correctly, Bob?

446
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:24,187
-對的 但是我們得把他 -它也許還能發出X射線
- Yes, but we have to... - It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

447
00:43:24,212 --> 00:43:25,739
理論上是的 長官 但是
- In principle, Sir, yes but...

448
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,858
如果我們想用他來對付蘇聯
- If we want to get the edge on the Soviets

449
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:30,470
-我們就得活體解剖這個玩意 -不不不
- we need to vivisect this thing. - No, no, no.

450
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:32,141
-把它大卸八塊 看看它體內到底是怎樣的 -不
Take it apart. Learn how it works. - No.

451
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,250
不可以 那樣就和初衷背道而馳了
- No. That would defeat the purpose

452
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,156
長官 他要暈過去了 求你們了
Sir? He's passed out. Please.

453
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:40,599
把他放到水箱裡 讓他恢復氣壓
Put him in the tank. Let him pressurize.

454
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,780
霍伊特將軍 長官
General Hoyt, sir!

455
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,988
你無論如何 都不能殺死這個生物
You cannot, under any circumstance, kill this creature.

456
00:43:52,854 --> 00:43:56,155
看看我肩上是什麼 五顆星
Count these with me, Son. There's five of them.

457
00:43:56,786 --> 00:43:58,910
我他媽想怎麼處置它就怎麼處置它
That means I can do whatever the hell I want.

458
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:01,069
你有什麼建議想說的 我會聽聽
You wanna plead your case? I'll listen to it.

459
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,923
但是到頭來 我還是最終裁決者
But, end of the day, it is my damn decision.

460
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:52,254
把那鬼東西給解剖了
Then cut and open that thing.

461
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,302
我們得把一切弄得清清楚楚的
We need clarity in this case.

462
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,743
好好犒勞一下自己 斯特裡蘭
And give yourself a good pat on the back, Strickland.

463
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,696
-你做到了 -感謝你 長官
- You've done it. - Thank you sir.

464
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,340
加快步伐把這件事做完 孩子
Now hurry up and finish this job, son.

465
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:02,822
沒問題 長官
Absolutely, sir.

466
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:07,889
把他弄出來 你在說什麼
Get him out? What are you talking?

467
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,595
不 當然不行
No! Absolutely not!

468
00:45:11,638 --> 00:45:13,587
因為這違法了 所以不行
Because it's breaking the law! And that's what.

469
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,962
可能我們這樣過過嘴癮都算是違法了呢
We're probably breaking the law, just talking about it.

470
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,615
噢 他隻身一人 噢
Oh, he's alone. Oh.

471
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:23,495
這麼說來 我們每次去中式餐廳
This mean that... whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant

472
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,202
你都想把水箱裡的魚救出來嗎
you want to save every fish in the tank?

473
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:29,503
他隻身一人又怎麼樣 我們都只能靠自己
So what if he's alone? We're all alone.

474
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,680
是你見過最孤獨的東西
The loneliest thing you've ever seened?

475
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:33,178
好吧 你自己都說了 你自己都說出口了
Well you just said it, right? You just said it.

476
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:36,988
你叫他"東西" 他只是個東西 是個怪胎
You called it a thing. It's a thing. It's a freak.

477
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:39,791
我能理解你
I can understand you.

478
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,477
冷靜 天啊 冷靜點好嗎
- Calm down! God, calm down!

479
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:47,966
好吧 我 我跟著你說
Alright. I will... I will repeat it to you.

480
00:45:53,976 --> 00:45:54,835
我是誰
"What I am?

481
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:02,880
我像他一樣動嘴巴
I move my mouth, like him.

482
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,136
我像他一樣說不出話
I make no sound, like him.

483
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:11,427
那我算是什麼東西呢
What does that make me?

484
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:18,023
我這樣的人 我的身世經歷
All that I am, all that I've ever been

485
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:21,482
讓我和他相遇
Brought me here to him.

486
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,666
你看 你現在又說"他"了 現在又變成"他"了
You see, you're saying "Him". It's a "Him" Now.

487
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:24,349
他是
It's a...

488
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:25,462
噢
Ow.

489
00:46:25,622 --> 00:46:27,219
你打我
You just hit me!

490
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:28,931
伊萊莎 放開我
Elisa, let go of me.

491
00:46:29,218 --> 00:46:32,163
我在看 我在看 你從沒 打過我的
I'm looking, I'm looking. You've never... hit me!

492
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,061
他看著我的時候 他看我的方式
When he looks at me, the way he looks at me.

493
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:45,932
他不知道我有缺陷
He does not know what I lack.

494
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:51,928
不知道我是不完整的
Or how I am incomplete.

495
00:46:54,069 --> 00:47:00,061
他眼中的我 是完整的
He sees me for what I am, as I am.

496
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:07,019
他看到我會很高興
He's happy to see me

497
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,799
每一次 每一天
Every time, every day.

498
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:17,910
現在 我可以選擇救他
And now I can either save him...

499
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,841
或者讓他死去
...or let him die.

500
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:32,734
我得走了 我得 我得走了
I'm leaving. I have to... no I have to leave.

501
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:36,070
伊萊莎 拜託 別這樣了 聽我說 你聽我說
Just Elisa, please stop! Listen to me. Just listen to me.

502
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:39,583
我得走了 我現在必須走了因為
I have to go! I'm leaving now because this...

503
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:41,375
伊萊莎 因為這對我很重要
Elisa, this is very important to me.

504
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:42,701
這是我的第二次機會了
This is a second chance for me!

505
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,440
我很抱歉 我真的得走了
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

506
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,843
等我回來的時候 我們再也不要討論這件事了
And when I come back. We will not talk about this, ever again.

507
00:47:49,522 --> 00:47:51,641
伊萊莎 夠了 夠了
Elisa... there's... Alright. Alright.

508
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:57,179
我們算老幾啊 我和你 我們算什麼 我們什麼都不是
What are we? What are you and I? What we are? We are nothing!

509
00:47:57,527 --> 00:47:58,659
沒用的 我們什麼都做不了
Nothing. We can't do nothing!

510
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:00,445
抱歉
I'm sorry.

511
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:02,651
但這 這 這真的
But this-this-this is just...

512
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,228
噢 天啊 他連人都算不上
Oh god! He's not even human!

513
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,610
天老爺
God.

514
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:11,181
又怎麼
What?

515
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:29,472
賈爾斯
Giles!

516
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:36,603
-我一直在等你 -我知道 抱歉
- I've been waiting. - I know, sorry.

517
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:37,175
沒事
It's okay.

518
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:40,143
我們不進去嗎
We going in?

519
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,644
你直接把作品寄給我就行
You should've just mailed the art.

520
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,842
不 我想親自給你和你們團隊看
No! I wanted to show you it to you and the team and person

521
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,215
這是我最好的作品之一
It's some of my best work.

522
00:48:49,022 --> 00:48:50,402
這綠色好像還行
As green as it can be!

523
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:52,351
現在呃
It's uh...

524
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:55,613
現在不是好時機 要不再等等吧
It's not a good time. Maybe later.

525
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:00,326
噢 好啊 沒問題
Oh well, sure, no problem.

526
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:05,516
什麼時候對你來說才是好時機 伯尼
What would be good time for you, Bernie?

527
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:14,509
你畫的嗎
You painted that?

528
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:15,871
是啊
- Yeah.

529
00:49:16,643 --> 00:49:19,414
哇 你太厲害了
Wow!! You're good!

530
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,266
然而並沒有照片那麼好
Apparently, not as good as a photograph.

531
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:25,393
但還是很棒 不是嗎 哈
But it's good, isn't it, huh?

532
00:49:25,536 --> 00:49:27,504
哎 我反正畫不出
Pfft. I couldn't paint like that.

533
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:29,586
給 我請
Here. On me.

534
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:30,980
請我嗎
For me?

535
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:33,693
我們這像你這樣的客人很少 你看起來
We don't get many like you in here. You seem...

536
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:36,232
很有學識 我喜歡和你交談
very educated. I like talking to you.

537
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:38,871
是這樣 這也是
The thing is... That's the...

538
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,470
我來這裡的唯一原因
The only reason that I come in here is...

539
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:46,633
來聊天 而且我們的餡餅也確實不錯 對吧
- The conversation. And the pie is mighty fine too, isn't it?

540
00:49:46,658 --> 00:49:47,585
沒錯 沒錯

你知道嗎 我是獨立工作者 而且
You know, I work alone. And uh...

543
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,341
我的好朋友並不善言談
my best friend is not much of a conversationalist.

544
00:50:01,992 --> 00:50:03,714
所以呀 這就是我工作的一部分
You see? That's part of being on the job here.

545
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,265
和酒保是一樣的
It's like being a bartender.

546
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,504
要給顧客上餡餅
You serve people pie,

547
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,349
還要傾聽他們的故事 瞭解他們
you listen to their problems. Get to know them.

548
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:12,892
我想更好地瞭解你
I'd like to get to know you better.

549
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:15,440
你他媽在幹嘛 臭老頭

557
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:35,991
你不用這樣跟他們講話的
You don't need to talk to them like that.

558
00:50:37,397 --> 00:50:38,428
你也該走了
You should go, too.

559
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,879

And don't come back. This is a family restaurant.

560
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,891
我也隻身一人
I have no one.

561
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:06,599
你是唯一一個願意傾聽我的人了
And you're the only person that I can talk to.

562
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:07,933
所以呢

563

你知道嗎 我自己都想不明白
You know, I can't figure it out myself.

629
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,948
你看起來並不驚艷
You're not much to look at.

630
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:07,240
然而我卻一直在想著你
Go figure. I keep thinking about you.

631
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:10,681
你說你不能說話 是全啞
When you say you're mute, are you entirely silent

632
00:58:10,826 --> 00:58:12,338

I don't want an intricate, beautiful thing destroyed.

657
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:42,895

This thing dies. You learn. I leave. Out of here.

662
01:01:03,507 --> 01:01:05,357
蘇聯佬也可以啊 外國佬什麼的
So are the Soviets, the Gooks

663
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,122
我們還不是照殺無誤
And we still kill them, don't we?

664
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:10,865
總而言之 這裡可不是什麼動物園
The bottom line is, this is not a petting zoo.

665
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:14,588
而且 這鬼地方 我不想在這裡多待一秒

你想嗎
Do you?

Did you move the camera? On the loading dock?

672
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:09,885
你想從那裡帶他走嗎 走員工通道
Is that where you are taking him? Through the service tunnels?

673
01:02:10,379 --> 01:02:11,434

鹽水濃度保持在百分之五到百分之八
Water must be kept at 5 to 8 percent salinity.

676

斯特裡蘭先生

你瘋了嗎
Are you out of your mind?

687
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,789
你不能這麼做 伊萊莎 你不能這麼做
Do not do this, Elisa! Don't do this!

我發誓我不是故意不下車的
I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose!

701
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:45,519
這個卡扣 我弄不下來
Mechanical objects and I don't get along...

702
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,350
她在坡道等你

Who's that man? I think he just killed someone!

705
01:06:12,496 --> 01:06:14,877

708
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:49,623
是我撞的嗎
Did I do that?

709
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,583
我真的太不會玩特工遊戲了
I'm just not good at this.

710
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:55,910
快 快
Move! Move!

711

712
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:09,542
鹽 你在說什麼 什麼鹽
Salt? What are you talking about, Salt?

713
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:13,193
伊萊莎
Elisa!

714
01:09:22,906 --> 01:09:23,437
以色列的截斷器
Israeli cropper.

715
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:23,779
你聞到鎂的味道了嗎
Do you smell the magnesium?

716
01:09:29,495 --> 01:09:30,776
俄羅斯人痛恨猶太人
The Russians hate the Jews,

717
01:09:30,777 --> 01:09:32,769
但是卻離不開他們的這些小玩意兒
but they can't get enough of their gadgets

718
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:36,033
他們是怎麼進來的
How did they get in?

719
01:09:36,597 --> 01:09:39,255
假身份 套牌車 等等 諸如此類的
Forged ID. Fake plates. And so on and so forth...

720
01:09:39,402 --> 01:09:41,894
而且他們挪動了坡道的主監控 長官
And they moved the main video camera on the dock, Sir.

721
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,722
先不要讓其他人直到這件事 上報之前我們還有24小時調查時間
Well, no one has to know. We got 24 hours before I bounce out.

722
01:09:46,003 --> 01:09:46,725
我電話通知上面了
I called it in.

723
01:09:47,941 --> 01:09:48,814
你通知了
Did you called it in?

724
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:51,063
事情一發生我就
The moment it happened, I...

725
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:52,967
斯特裡蘭先生 長官
Mr. Strickland, Sir.

726
01:09:54,465 --> 01:09:55,259
又有什麼事 薩利

727
01:09:55,638 --> 01:09:57,814
霍伊特將軍在線上 長官

728
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:00,810
那可是我們的太空狗啊 斯特裡蘭
That thing was our Space Dog, Strickland.

729
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:01,828
你也心知肚明吧
You know that.

730
01:10:01,882 --> 01:10:03,167
長官 我一定把他追回來
Sir, I'm gettin' it back.

731
01:10:04,217 --> 01:10:07,804
我不 我不會坐以待斃的 長官
I don't-I can't be in a negative frame of mind, Sir.

732
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,144
所以你有信心嗎
So you're feeling good?

733
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,321
信心十足 務必追回
Feeling strong. Getting it back.

734
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:13,145
我相信你可以
You can get it done.

735
01:10:13,146 --> 01:10:16,625
你也一定要可以 為了我也要做到 孩子 為了我
You're gonna get it done. For me, Son. For me.

736
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,161
你要等到那天才把他給放了嗎
Is that when you're planning on releasing him?

737
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:01,878
十號
On the tenth?

738
01:11:03,978 --> 01:11:05,414
萬一雨季來遲了呢
So what if the rains are late?

739
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:07,065
河道那裡會怎樣呢
What happens with the canal?

740
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:09,850
好吧
All right.

741
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:15,381
那是什麼
What's that?

742
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:17,561
給我看看
Let me see it.

743
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:19,196
是給我的嗎
Is that for me?

744
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:01,218
裝吧 你就繼續裝吧
That's good, keep it up.

745
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:04,295
裝得跟個沒事人似的
Lookin' like you don't know anything.

746
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:08,241
如果他們問我幹了什麼
Lord help me if they ask me if I do.

747
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:10,489
我可不怎麼會撒謊
I am not a good liar.

748
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:11,919
除了對布魯斯特
Except for Brewster.

749
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:14,366
謊言是維繫婚姻的秘訣
Takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going.

750
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:15,628
全體員工
All personnel.

751
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,144
準備好出示您的身份證和門禁卡
Prepare to present your ID and entrance card.

752
01:12:18,597 --> 01:12:19,771
安保措施已經
Security measures has been...

753
01:12:20,082 --> 01:12:21,414
這是怎
What in the...?

754
01:12:21,978 --> 01:12:23,937
全體員工 請注意
Attention. All personnel.

755
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:26,406
準備好出示您的身份證和門禁卡
Prepare to present your ID and entrance card

756
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:29,396
都是你惹的禍
You got us in trouble!

757
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:32,436
長官 我覺得我們的對手是一支訓練有素的隊伍
In my opinion, we are looking at a highly trained group, Sir.

758
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:34,105
我覺得很有可能
I'm thinking, conceivably,

759
01:12:34,106 --> 01:12:36,679
是某支特種部隊什麼的
Sir. Special Forces and so on and so forth.

760
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,225
紅軍特種部隊嗎
Red Army Special forces?

761
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:39,205
非常有可能
- Conceivably.

762
01:12:40,033 --> 01:12:43,548
一支訓練有素 靠山強硬的精英部隊
A highly-trained, well-financed, elite group.

763
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:46,811
身手敏捷 冷酷決絕 作戰精準
Highly efficient, ruthless, clockwork precision.

764
01:12:46,936 --> 01:12:49,055
他們潛入這裡總共才花了5分鐘
Infiltration took less than five minutes, Sir.

765
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,199
保守估計
My conservative estimate is that

766
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,341
也得有個十來人左右才能幹得來
this is a Strict Force of at least 10 men.

767
01:13:08,012 --> 01:13:09,527
你一直都是一個人嗎
Have you always been alone?

768
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:16,015
你有跟人處過嗎
Did you ever have someone?

769
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:19,800
你知道你的身世嗎 你還記得嗎
Do you know what happened to you? Do you?

770
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,020
因為 我就不知道 我都不知道我這是怎麼了
'Cause I don't. I don't know what happen to me.

771
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,327
我不知道
I don't know.

772
01:13:24,852 --> 01:13:25,953
我看著鏡子
I look in the mirror,

773
01:13:25,954 --> 01:13:28,418
我唯一認得的就是這雙眼睛
the only thing that I recognize are these eyes.

774
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:31,304
在我這張老臉上
In this old man's face.

775
01:13:37,138 --> 01:13:38,402
有時候我覺得
And sometimes I think I was

776
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:40,558
我要麼生得太早了 要麼有點太晚了
either born too early or too late for my life.

777
01:13:43,772 --> 01:13:45,805
可能我們都快行將就木了
Maybe we're both just relics.

778
01:14:01,824 --> 01:14:02,919
長官 她們來了
Sir? I got them.

779
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,022
澤爾達 伊萊莎 請進
Zelda, Elisa. Come in.

780
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,878
看起來好像事情發生之前 你們倆都打卡下班了
Looks like you two, punched out before the incident.

781
01:14:16,196 --> 01:14:16,838
所以
So.

782
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:20,703
如果你們知道點什麼
If you know something about what transpired here.

783
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:24,290
你們有義務如實上報
It's your obligation to report any detail.

784
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,894
不論線索看起來有多麼微不足道
No matter how small or trivial it may seem.

785
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,658
微不足道 就是說不太重要
"Trivial" Means "Unimportant".

786
01:14:30,142 --> 01:14:33,245
我不知道有什麼反常的 沒有
I didn't seem nothin' out of the ordinary. No.

787
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:36,693
也沒有什麼微不足道的事 我的腳當時很痛
Or trivial. See? My feet were hurting...

788
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:37,842
你呢
What about you?

789
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:42,414
她什麼都沒看見
She didn't see anything.

790
01:14:52,358 --> 01:14:54,147
霍夫施塔特 霍夫施塔特博士呢
Hoffstetler. Dr. Hoffstetler.

791
01:14:54,439 --> 01:14:56,970
你們倆有沒有看見他進出過實驗室
Did either of you see him coming in or out of the lab?

792
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,050
他在裡面工作啊 不是嗎
He works there, doesn't he?

793
01:14:59,154 --> 01:15:01,056
我說的是另一種進出
I mean in a different way.

794
01:15:01,318 --> 01:15:02,962
可能他做了些不一樣的事
Doing something different.

795
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,482
微不足道的事嘛 沒有 長官
Something trivial? No sir.

796
01:15:22,716 --> 01:15:24,176
我在幹什麼
What am I doing?

797
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:26,525
訊問這兩個傻逼幫手
Interviewing the fucking help...

798
01:15:28,268 --> 01:15:29,851
清潔工
The shit cleaners...

799
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:32,549
掃廁所的
The piss wipers.

800
01:15:36,325 --> 01:15:38,100
你們兩個 走吧 走
You two, go ahead. Leave.

801
01:15:49,532 --> 01:15:50,563
你跟我說什麼
What did you say to me?

802
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:58,543
-她說什麼 -我沒看見
- What did she say? - I didn't catch it.

803
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:04,822
-她說什麼 -她說謝謝你
- What is she saying?! - She is saying "Thank you".

804
01:16:15,264 --> 01:16:16,002
下一個
Next.

805
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:58,377
現在只剩一件事沒做了
There's only one thing left to do.

806
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:00,999
自告奮勇
"Volunteer".

807
01:17:29,462 --> 01:17:31,538
不要 不要
No! No!

808
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:56,220
我想早點回家
I want to get home early.

809
01:17:57,433 --> 01:18:00,319
布魯斯特最近心情不好
Brewster has been in a bad mood lately...

810
01:18:03,576 --> 01:18:04,591
我的天吶
Holy Jesus!

811
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:05,585
你猥猥瑣瑣地
What are you doing standing

812
01:18:05,586 --> 01:18:07,004
站在女更衣室的暗處幹什麼呢
in the shadows of the women's locker room??

813
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,108
他們可能在監視我 這裡沒攝像頭
They may be watching me, and there are no cameras here/

814
01:18:09,202 --> 01:18:10,194
就是為了不讓人看到啊
For good reason.

815
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:12,097
現在風聲正緊 你找我們做什麼
What if you caught us in an inconvenient moment?

816
01:18:12,122 --> 01:18:14,947
-我想知道他還好嗎 -他很好
- I need to know that he is alright. - He is.

817
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,333
-你打算什麼時候放了他 -很快
- When will you release him? - Soon.

818
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:20,694
等到雨水灌滿通向大海的河道的時候
When the rain fills the canal that flows to the sea.

819
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:24,647
如果你們需要什麼 聯繫我
If you need anything.

820
01:18:25,237 --> 01:18:26,813
放了他 盡快
Release him. Soon.

821
01:18:30,522 --> 01:18:31,768
她說什麼
What did she say?

822
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:34,644
她說 你是個好人 霍夫施塔特博士
She said, you're a good man, Doctor Hoffstetler.

823
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,324
我叫迪米特裡
My name is Dimitri.

824
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:44,076
很榮幸認識你們
Honored to meet you.

825
01:18:46,537 --> 01:18:48,624
嘿 啞巴 有電話找你
Hey, dummy! Phone call for you.

826
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:49,751
緊急電話
It's urgent.

827
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:59,154
不用擔心我 我很好 相信我 我很好
Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Believe me, I'm fine.

828
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:02,824
他吃了潘多拉 不是他的錯
He ate Pandora, it wasn't his fault.

829
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:04,334
野性使然
He's a wild creature.

830
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:06,362
我們也不能對他有太多的要求
We can't ask him to be anything else.

831
01:19:06,514 --> 01:19:09,506
伊萊莎 去找他 去 去
Elisa, Go find him. Go. Go!

832
01:19:10,357 --> 01:19:11,126
去啊
Go!

833
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,120
你真走運
You're lucky.

834
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,303
我盡量保持清醒
I stayed awake as long as I could

835
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:24,121
但我現在一把老骨頭了
But I'm not even a young man anymore.

836
01:20:24,742 --> 01:20:26,242
他還好嗎 你確定嗎
Is he alright? You sure?

837
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:31,848
你去哪 不要走
Where are you going? No, no.

838
01:20:33,466 --> 01:20:35,759
好吧 不 別跟小貓玩
Ok. No, no. Don't play with the kitties.

839
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:38,356
別跟小貓玩
Don't play with the kitties.

840
01:20:39,224 --> 01:20:40,523
我沒生氣
I'm not angry.

841
01:20:55,157 --> 01:20:57,823
是你幹的好事 沒事 哦 這樣不衛生
You did that. That's okay. Ooh. I don't think that's sanitary.

842
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:03,343
好了
Enough.

843
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,222
他很有意思
Interesting guy.

844
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:19,865
全體員工
All personnel.

845
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,382
準備好出示您的身份證和門禁卡
Prepare to present your ID and entrance card.

846
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:24,207
您想見我
You wanted to see me?

847
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:30,248
事情進展如何 事故調查
How's it going? The investigation?

848
01:21:30,533 --> 01:21:32,947
嗯 已經有眉目了
- Well, we have a promising lead.

849
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:34,716
真的嗎
Really?

850
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,922
這是好消息
That's good to hear.

851
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:40,852
你在加爾維斯敦的時候加入組織
You joined us in Galveston.

852
01:21:40,965 --> 01:21:43,623
-之前你在哪 霍夫施塔特 -博士
But where were you before, Hoffstetler? - Doctor.

853
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,455
-什麼 -霍夫施塔特
Excuse me? - Doctor.

854
01:21:45,717 --> 01:21:46,655
博士
Hoffstetler.

855
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,044
規定
Protocol.

856
01:21:52,217 --> 01:21:54,788
-威斯康星州麥迪遜市 -沒錯
- Wisconsin. Madison. - That's right.

857
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:57,276
你放棄了一個終身職位 是吧
You gave up a tenure track position. Didn't you?

858
01:21:58,177 --> 01:21:59,121
捨棄一切
Gave it all up...

859
01:22:00,304 --> 01:22:01,082
就為了加入我們
For us.

860
01:22:04,014 --> 01:22:07,704
我想你已經準備好離開組織了 嗯
I suppose you're getting ready to leave us now, then, huh?

861
01:22:09,027 --> 01:22:10,669
除非那個生物找不到了
Only if the creature isn't found.

862
01:22:14,164 --> 01:22:16,401
你覺得呢 你覺得我們能找到它嗎
What do you think? You think we will find it?

863
01:22:16,881 --> 01:22:18,753
嗯 你說已經有眉目了
Well, you said you had a lead.

864
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:21,079
我是說過
- I do.

865
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:12,981
你笑什麼 親愛的
Why you smiling, hon?

866
01:25:15,356 --> 01:25:16,419
不要這個樣子
Stop looking like that.

867
01:25:19,509 --> 01:25:20,270
怎麼了
What happened?

868
01:25:24,683 --> 01:25:25,294
怎麼了
Why?

869
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:27,908
怎麼做的
How?

870
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:30,016
怎麼做的
How?

871
01:25:31,657 --> 01:25:33,942
他有 有那個嗎
Does he? Have a?

872
01:25:40,059 --> 01:25:40,639
嗯
Mmm.

873
01:25:42,655 --> 01:25:43,337
嗯
Mmm.

874
01:25:53,604 --> 01:25:55,310
永遠不要相信男人
Never trust a man.

875
01:25:56,036 --> 01:25:58,107
就算他看起來像個太監
Even when he looks flat down there.

876
01:28:03,823 --> 01:28:06,574
我剛報了人類學的課
I just signed up in anthropology.

877
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:08,907
我們要在亞馬遜叢林上課了
We're gonna go have classes in the Amazon Jungle...

878
01:28:08,932 --> 01:28:10,559

879
01:28:10,584 --> 01:28:12,627
哦 兄弟 你明天早上得早點出發
Oh man. You have to get off early in the morning

880
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:13,441
走著去可遠了呢
That's a long hike.

881
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,294
-我們要在那定居下來 -是嗎
- We're gonna stay down there. - We are?

882
01:28:16,369 --> 01:28:18,051
哦 不 你不用來
Oh no. You're not coming along too.

883
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:21,631
這是明膠凍糕
This is a gelatin parfait.

884
01:28:22,461 --> 01:28:23,613
你一定很喜歡
You will love it.

885
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:25,296
爸爸 我們能看神偷拍檔嗎
Dad, can we watch Bonanza?

886
01:28:25,462 --> 01:28:28,667
神偷拍檔太暴力了 你知道我今天在想什麼嗎
Bonanza is much too violent. You know what I was thinking today?

887
01:28:28,692 --> 01:28:29,993
我們給孩子們一個小木
We get the kids a P-U-P-P...

888
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:24,227
你們搞什麼 水都灌到我影院裡去了
What is going on? I've got water pouring into my theater.

889
01:31:24,339 --> 01:31:26,719
我還有四個付費房客呢 我可付不起退款
I have four paying customers. I can't afford a refund.

890
01:31:26,744 --> 01:31:28,148
可能是管道問題 我去修理
It's probably a pipe. I'll take care of it.

891
01:31:28,173 --> 01:31:30,173
-修不好以後就別租了 -能修好的
If you don't fix it. No more renting. - I will fix it.

892
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:49,829
伊萊莎
Elisa!

893
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:52,504
天啊
Dear God!

894
01:31:52,865 --> 01:31:53,587
伊萊莎
Elisa!

895
01:32:23,636 --> 01:32:24,991
我在擦我的頭髮
I'm toweling my hair.

896
01:32:26,532 --> 01:32:27,382
是我的頭髮耶
It's my hair!

897
01:32:28,746 --> 01:32:33,047
還有 還有 看看胳膊 傷口
And... and... look at the arm. The wound.

898
01:32:33,234 --> 01:32:35,170
就像沒受過傷一樣 你看
As if it was never there. Look at them.

899
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:39,393
你說過 他曾被尊為神
You said... He was worshipped like a god.

900
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:41,687
他是神嗎 我不覺得他是什麼神 他生吃了一隻貓耶
Is he a God? I don't look to him as a God. He ate a cat

901
01:32:41,712 --> 01:32:43,577
我不知道 不知道
So I-I don't know! I don't know!

902
01:32:44,557 --> 01:32:46,263
我們得讓他再待一段時間
We have to keep him around, awhile

903
01:32:47,779 --> 01:32:48,692
很快
A little while.

904
01:33:08,674 --> 01:33:09,169
喂
Hello?

905
01:34:50,676 --> 01:34:51,880
您的水 先生
Your water, Sir.

906
01:34:53,246 --> 01:34:55,675
-先生 霍伊特將軍找您 -別 別
- And, Sir, General Hoyt. - Uh-mm. Uh-mm.

907
01:34:56,443 --> 01:34:57,498
告訴他 我不在
Tell him I'm not in, tell him

908
01:34:57,499 --> 01:34:59,101
告訴他 我會給他打回去的 別把他的電話轉給我
I will call him back. Don't put him through.

909
01:34:59,786 --> 01:35:02,419
不是的 先生 他就在您辦公室
No, Sir. He's in your office.

910
01:35:06,364 --> 01:35:08,784
眼下我們只擔心我們的研究對像
At this point our only concern is the asset.

911
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:09,919
抓回來了嗎
Do you have it?

912
01:35:10,186 --> 01:35:11,781
還沒有 長官
Still in the wind, sir.

913
01:35:12,822 --> 01:35:13,956
這樣可不行啊
That won't do.

914
01:35:14,976 --> 01:35:16,340
是的 長官 我明白
Yes sir. I know.

915
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,455
您認識我多久了 長官
You've know me for how long, Sir?

916
01:35:21,046 --> 01:35:24,578
-三十年 從釜山戰役就認識你了 -沒錯 長官
- Thirteen years. Battle of Pusan. - Yes, sir.

917
01:35:25,064 --> 01:35:28,667
我向來都守信 忠誠 辦事高效 一直如此
A man is faithful, loyal, efficient all of his life. All of it

918
01:35:28,794 --> 01:35:31,398
而且 對國家有用
And he is... useful.

919
01:35:31,605 --> 01:35:34,224
他期望...
And he expects...

920
01:35:35,926 --> 01:35:38,433
他期待一定的回報
He has certain expectations in return.

921
01:35:40,424 --> 01:35:41,781
然後 他失敗了
And then... He fails.

922
01:35:41,806 --> 01:35:43,773
一次 僅此一次
Once. Only once.

923
01:35:44,154 --> 01:35:44,948
那算什麼呢
What does that make?

924
01:35:45,835 --> 01:35:47,065
就此否定他的所有嗎
Does that make him a failure?

925
01:35:51,343 --> 01:35:54,811
什麼時候才算個頭呢 長官 人要證明自己
When is a man done, Sir? Proving himself?

926
01:35:55,515 --> 01:35:56,871
是個好人
A good man.

927
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:59,292
是個體面的人
A decent man.

928
01:36:03,195 --> 01:36:04,092
體面
Decent?

929
01:36:09,643 --> 01:36:12,754
把事情辦妥 才算體面
A man must have the decency not to fuck up.

930
01:36:13,411 --> 01:36:14,425
這是一點
That's one thing.

931
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:16,117
這才算真體面
That is real decent of him.

932
01:36:17,374 --> 01:36:21,254
其他方面的體面 不重要
The other kind of decency. It doesn't really matter.

933
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:24,403
我們出口商品
We sell it. But it's an export.

934
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:26,735
是因為我們用不上
We sell it 'cause we don't use it.

935
01:36:28,082 --> 01:36:33,446
要麼 在三十六小時內解決這件事
36 hours from now, this entire episode will be over.

936
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:36,702
要麼 就等著被賣出去吧
And so will you.

937
01:36:38,387 --> 01:36:42,514
我們這個世界呢 到時候就只剩下你的一點點印記
Our universe will have a hole in it with your outline.

938
01:36:43,509 --> 01:36:47,884
然後你會到一個平行宇宙去
And you will have moved on to an alternate universe.

939
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:51,083
一個亂七八糟的地方
A universe of shit.

940
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:55,702
那裡沒有文明
You will be lost to civilization.

941
01:36:58,477 --> 01:37:00,749
在那裡 你從未出生
And you will be unborn.

942
01:37:02,437 --> 01:37:03,278
從未受過教育
Unmade.

943
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:06,804
徹底完蛋
Undone.

944
01:37:13,871 --> 01:37:16,293
所以 把自己弄得真正體面一點 孩子
So, go get some real decency, Son.

945
01:37:17,777 --> 01:37:19,316
收拾好這堆爛攤子
And unfuck this mess.

946
01:37:55,247 --> 01:37:56,301
三十六小時
Thirty-six hours.

947
01:37:57,398 --> 01:37:58,273
三十六小時
Thirty-six hours.

948
01:37:59,148 --> 01:38:00,204
說到做到 你要履行諾言
Deliver. You deliver.

949
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:02,078
這就是你的工作 說到做到
That's what you do. You deliver, right?

950
01:38:02,379 --> 01:38:03,380
是吧
Right?!

951
01:39:17,205 --> 01:39:18,617
你永遠
You'll...

01:39:37,469 --> 01:39:39,342
#不會知道#
# Never know... #

960
01:39:39,898 --> 01:39:41,675

961
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:49,183
#在乎#
# I care... #

962
01:39:52,502 --> 01:39:54,089
#我努力隱藏#
# And if I tried #

963
01:39:54,744 --> 01:40:02,485
#還是藏不住對你的愛意#
# I still couldn't hide my love for you. #

964
01:40:02,881 --> 01:40:04,910
#你要知道#

965
01:40:05,157 --> 01:40:10,375
#即使我不說#
# For haven't I told you so #

966
01:40:18,906 --> 01:40:25,755
#你走之後 我的心也隨你去了#
# You went away and my heart went with you #

967
01:40:27,976 --> 01:40:36,263
#每次祈禱 我都念著你的名字#
# I speak your name in my every prayer #

968
01:40:36,956 --> 01:40:44,227
#若有其它方法證明我的愛#
# If there is some other way to prove That I love you #

969
01:40:44,597 --> 01:40:48,684
#我不知道怎樣證明#
# I swear I don't know how. #

970
01:40:50,251 --> 01:40:52,575
#如果你現在不懂#
# You'll never know #

971
01:40:52,982 --> 01:40:59,791
#你永遠不會知道#
# If you don't know now #

972
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:20,624
伊萊莎
Elisa.

973
01:41:23,145 --> 01:41:24,478
怎麼了 親愛的
What is it, my honey?

974
01:41:51,453 --> 01:41:52,889
這可不太好啊
This isn't good.

975
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:57,786
我去給霍夫施塔特博士打電話
I'm going to call Dr. Hoffstetler

976
01:41:59,845 --> 01:42:01,540
你今晚必須放他走 親愛的
You got to release him tonight, honey.

977

您看上去不是很好
You don't look so well.

982
01:42:46,503 --> 01:42:47,145
閉嘴
Shut up.

983
01:42:49,981 --> 01:42:51,393
聞到什麼味道了嗎
Can you smell that?

984
01:42:52,216 --> 01:42:55,549
我覺得是您的手指 都黑了
I think it's your fingers. They are black.

01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,570
沒必要罵人吧 長官
There's no call for cursing, Sir.

987
01:43:11,064 --> 01:43:13,077
下車 我開就行了
Get out of the car. I'm taking it.

988
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:16,684

990
01:44:53,741 --> 01:44:58,828
-斯特裡蘭 謝天謝地 -你剛說的是俄語啊 鮑勃

992
01:45:12,499 --> 01:45:16,649
不是 別撒謊了 沒必要
Oh no. Don't lie. You don't need to.

993
01:45:16,903 --> 01:45:18,688
你腹部中槍
You took a bullet to your gut.

994
01:45:18,881 --> 01:45:20,106
你死定了
You're dead.

995
01:45:20,567 --> 01:45:23,947
給我突擊隊所有人的名字 級別 還有位置
I need the names, ranks and locations of the entire Strike Team.

997
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:28,487
帶走研究對象的那支小隊
The ones that took the asset.

998
01:45:37,983 --> 01:45:42,760
這種糖 是便宜貨 我從小就喜歡
This candy. It's cheap candy. I love it ever since I was a kid.

999
01:45:43,926 --> 01:45:46,839
有些人喜歡高級點的零食
Some folks favor more sophisticated snacks

1000
01:45:46,934 --> 01:45:50,324
牛軋糖 還有木薯泥那些垃圾

1001
01:45:51,126 --> 01:45:52,213
可我不喜歡 鮑勃
But not me, Bob.

1002
01:45:53,435 --> 01:45:54,689
我就喜歡這個
This is it for me.

1003
01:45:57,609 --> 01:45:59,783
有些時候 如果我覺得焦慮
Now. Sometimes, if I'm feeling anxious

1004
01:46:00,211 --> 01:46:01,306
我就直接把糖嚼碎了
I just bite right into it

1005
01:46:01,992 --> 01:46:05,127
但一般呢 我都會慢慢來
But mostly, I take my time.

1006
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:07,387
含著吃

1010
01:46:29,845 --> 01:46:30,956
沒有級別
No ranks

1011
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:32,987
她們
They...

1012
01:46:34,385 --> 01:46:35,654
她們只是保潔
They just clean.

1013
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:49,261
好了 布魯斯特 晚飯我給你做好了
Alright Brewster. I'm gonna fix you dinner

1014
01:46:49,286 --> 01:46:50,271
然後我就走了
and then I'm going to run

1015
01:46:50,272 --> 01:46:51,889
出去一會兒 幫朋友個忙
out for a little while and help a friend.

1016
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:55,932
-幫什麼忙 -就幫個朋友
- Help with what? - Helping a friend.

1017
01:46:58,481 --> 01:46:59,687
澤爾達
Zelda.

1018
01:47:00,362 --> 01:47:01,251
有人敲門
Door.

1019
01:47:05,315 --> 01:47:07,632
你就不能幫我開個門啊 布魯斯特
Well, You could well help me answer the door, Brewster!

1020
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,184
門離你就十尺遠
You're sittin' right there just ten feet away from it.

1021
01:47:10,209 --> 01:47:11,836
我背疼呢 你這女人 別擋電視
My back is acting up, woman. You move.

1022
01:47:11,861 --> 01:47:13,767
背疼 背疼 老是拿背當借口
Your back. Your back. Always your back.

1023
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:18,441
斯特裡蘭先生
Mr. Strickland!

1024
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:20,643
你來幹什麼
What are you doing here?

1025
01:47:21,132 --> 01:47:23,505
-那男的是誰啊 澤爾達 -它在哪

- What are you talking about? - Where did you take it?

1027
01:47:25,465 --> 01:47:26,156
澤爾達
Zelda.

1028
01:47:29,632 --> 01:47:32,990
實驗室裡那東西
The thing in the lab.

1029
01:47:34,052 --> 01:47:34,997
它在哪
Where is it?

1030
01:47:35,036 --> 01:47:36,901
-什麼在哪 -給我坐下
- Where is what? - Sit down!

1031
01:47:46,273 --> 01:47:47,638
抱歉 先生
I'm sorry, Sir.

1032
01:47:48,031 --> 01:47:50,015
如果我知道的話 我一定會說的
If I knew anything I would surely tell you.

1033
01:47:54,448 --> 01:47:56,219
參孫的故事
That story about Samson.

1034
01:47:57,591 --> 01:47:59,446
我沒告訴你結尾
I never told you how it ends.

1035
01:47:59,905 --> 01:48:04,325
非利士人折磨他 把他弄瞎
After the Philistines torture him and blind him.

1036
01:48:05,727 --> 01:48:08,782
參孫請求上帝賜他力量
Samson asks God for the strength he needs

1037
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:12,867
在最後一刻 他被寬恕了
And at the last minute, he is spared.

1038
01:48:13,645 --> 01:48:14,962
上帝
And the Lord...

1039
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:17,679
把他的力量還給了他
Gives him his strength back.

1040
01:48:18,568 --> 01:48:19,685
最後一次
One last time.

1041
01:48:22,342 --> 01:48:28,637
他用有力的雙臂
And he holds the columns of the temple

1042
01:48:29,171 --> 01:48:33,941
抱住神殿的柱子 把它們壓碎了
with his powerful arms and crushes them

1043
01:48:45,174 --> 01:48:48,570
讓整個神殿都倒塌了 壓死了裡邊所有的非利士人
And he brings the whole building down on the Philistines.

1044
01:48:54,469 --> 01:48:59,970
他死了 但是也殺死了那些混蛋
He dies. But he gets every single one of those motherfuckers.

1045
01:49:00,776 --> 01:49:02,230
那是他的遺願
That is his will.

1046
01:49:06,261 --> 01:49:07,332
所以
Now.

1047
01:49:07,602 --> 01:49:10,785
你現在知道我講這個故事什麼意思了吧
Do you know what that particular story means?

1048
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:13,324
迪萊拉
For us, Delilah?

1049
01:49:14,438 --> 01:49:16,803
這意味著 就算你現在有事情瞞著我不說
It means that if you know something you're not telling me,

1050
01:49:16,828 --> 01:49:18,026
你早晚會說的
you're gonna tell me.

1051
01:49:18,717 --> 01:49:22,248
在我毀了神殿
Either before or after...

1052
01:49:22,955 --> 01:49:25,534
跟你同歸於盡之前
I bring this particular temple...

1053
01:49:26,621 --> 01:49:29,303
或者之後
down upon our heads.

1054
01:49:30,578 --> 01:49:32,309
她從實驗室偷走了那東西
Gal stole that thing right out the lab!

1055
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:33,697
我不知道是什麼
Whatever it is.

1056
01:49:34,179 --> 01:49:35,968
你把它帶走吧
You go took it.

1057
01:49:36,318 --> 01:49:37,275
我聽見了
I heard my wife.

1058
01:49:37,817 --> 01:49:39,420
聽見我老婆在電話裡說這事
Talking on the phone about it.

1059
01:49:44,106 --> 01:49:47,598
非常感謝你的協助 富勒先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller for your assistance.

1060
01:49:58,902 --> 01:50:01,568
-你幹的好事 -澤爾達
- What have you done? - Zelda!

1061
01:50:02,034 --> 01:50:04,528
我得警告她 他去找她了
I got to warn her. He's going after her

1062
01:50:04,643 --> 01:50:06,208
我不許你這麼做
You will do no such thing, Woman.

1063
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:09,533
你幹嘛處處為她著想 她可觸犯了法律
Why you worry about her? She broke the laws

1064
01:50:09,739 --> 01:50:11,651
閉嘴 布魯斯特 你給我閉嘴
Shut up, Brewster! You shut up!

1065
01:50:12,424 --> 01:50:13,852
這麼多年你都不開口
For years, you don't talk

1066
01:50:15,612 --> 01:50:17,223
現在你倒閉不上嘴了
and now you can't shut your mouth.

1067
01:50:18,729 --> 01:50:19,863
去你的 布魯斯特
Damn you Brewster!

1068
01:50:22,381 --> 01:50:23,500
你不會懂的
You wouldn't understand.

1069
01:50:24,413 --> 01:50:27,452
你不會懂的 你花一輩子去理解 都不會懂的
You couldn't understand. Not if you tried your whole life

1070
01:50:28,925 --> 01:50:30,560
-喂 -賈爾斯 是你嗎
- Hello? - Giles, that you?

1071
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,544
-是我 -讓伊萊莎接電話
- Yes. - Put Elisa on the phone.

1072
01:50:33,282 --> 01:50:34,289
是澤爾達
It's Zelda.

1073
01:50:36,248 --> 01:50:39,031
伊萊莎 如果你能聽見就敲敲電話
Elisa, honey, make a sound in the phone if you can hear

1074
01:50:40,521 --> 01:50:41,436
好 好的
Okay, good.

1075
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:43,211
他去找你了
He's coming for you.

1076
01:50:43,572 --> 01:50:45,587
你趕快逃 帶上那東西
You got to go now and you go to take that thing with you.

1077
01:50:45,978 --> 01:50:47,406
怎麼了 伊萊莎
What? Elisa!

1078
01:51:28,504 --> 01:51:29,417
他媽的
Dammit.

1079
01:51:41,503 --> 01:51:42,423
我們得走了
We have to go!

1080
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:46,314
你在哪
Where are you?

1081
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:48,449
你他媽到底在哪
Where the fuck are you?!

1082
01:52:32,426 --> 01:52:33,568
很好
That's nice.

1083
01:54:12,341 --> 01:54:13,694
我不會失敗
I do not fail.

1084
01:54:15,922 --> 01:54:17,001
我說到做到
I deliver.

1085
01:54:22,205 --> 01:54:23,131
伊萊莎
Elisa!

1086
01:54:24,653 --> 01:54:25,817
伊萊莎
Elisa!

1087
01:54:35,066 --> 01:54:35,756
不
No.

1088
01:55:24,318 --> 01:55:25,229
媽的
Fuck.

1089
01:55:26,709 --> 01:55:28,634
你真是個神
You are a God.

1090
01:57:35,441 --> 01:57:36,591
如果要我給你講
If I told you about it

1091
01:57:37,274 --> 01:57:38,361
我該說些什麼呢
What would I say?

1092
01:57:39,443 --> 01:57:41,340
他們後來幸福地生活在一起嗎
That they lived happily ever after?

1093
01:57:42,384 --> 01:57:43,927
我相信如此
I believe it is.

1094
01:57:45,077 --> 01:57:46,028
他們彼此深愛
That they were in love

1095
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,020
此情長長久久
That they remained in love.

1096
01:57:48,859 --> 01:57:50,230
我很確信
I'm sure that's true.

1097
01:57:51,774 --> 01:57:55,189
但每當我想起伊萊莎
But when I think of her, Elisa...

1098
01:57:56,964 --> 01:57:59,489
腦海中都會浮現一首詩
The only thing that comes to mind is a poem

1099
01:57:59,968 --> 01:58:03,832
那是幾百年前 由一個陷入愛戀的人喃喃而出
Whispered by someone in love, hundreds of years ago...

1100
01:58:04,855 --> 01:58:07,101
我感覺不到你的形狀
"Unable to perceive the shape of You"

1101
01:58:08,661 --> 01:58:10,614
你圍繞著我
"I find You all around me."

1102
01:58:11,535 --> 01:58:14,450
你的存在 使我眼中溢滿你的愛
"Your presence fills my eyes with your love"

1103
01:58:15,793 --> 01:58:17,226
使我內心柔軟
"It humbles my heart"

1104
01:58:18,198 --> 01:58:20,173
因為你無處不在
"For you are everywhere"
