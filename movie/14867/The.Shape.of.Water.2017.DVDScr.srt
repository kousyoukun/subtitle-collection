<i>If I spoke about it...</i>

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,380
<i>If I did...</i>

5
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,990
<i>what would I tell you...</i>

6
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,770
<i>I wonder?</i>

7
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,310
<i>Would I tell you
about the time...?</i>

8
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,250
<i>It happened a long
time ago, it seems...</i>

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,210
<i>in the last days of
a fair Prince's reign.</i>

10
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,140
<i>Or would I tell you
about the place?</i>

11
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,620
<i>A small city near the coast...</i>

12
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>but far from everything else.</i>

13
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,080
<i>Or... I don't know...</i>

14
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,910
<i>would I tell you about her?</i>

15
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,620
<i>The princess without voice.</i>

16
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,470
<i>Or perhaps
I would just warn you...</i>

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,390
<i>about the truth
of these facts...</i>

18
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,880
<i>and the tale
of love and loss...</i>

19
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,770
<i>and the monster...</i>

20
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,250
<i>who tried to destroy it all.</i>

21
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,120
<i>I have sinned.</i>

22
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,060
<i>I've offended the god.</i>

23
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,520
<i>I'm deep in sin,
my Lord Hedak.</i>

24
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,470
<i>Let me judge of that.</i>

25
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,630
<i>I've doubted the ceremony
of the sacrifice.</i>

26
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,340
<i>I don't wanna go upstairs.</i>

27
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,170
<i>Why, everybody's got to
go upstairs, Miss Lloyd,</i>

28
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,020
<i>if they wants to go to bed.</i>

29
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,330
The sirens wake you up?

30
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,360
It was a fire.
The chocolate factory.

31
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,530
Could you smell that?

32
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,900
Oh, my.
Toasted cocoa.

33
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,620
Tragedy and delight...
hand in hand.

34
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,750
Oh, my dear child.

35
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,980
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

36
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,170
I am the proverbial starving...

37
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,020
Oh, watch this.

38
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,760
It's Bojangles.
The stair dance.

39
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,870
Oh, that's so hard.

40
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,160
Cagney did it.
Different but beautiful.

41
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,100
<i>I wanna do that too.</i>

42
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,810
<i>All right.</i>

43
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,370
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yup.</i>

44
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,300
<i>Come on.</i>

45
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,370
<i>Ah!</i>

46
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,360
<i>Say, you catch on quick.</i>

Elisa!

49
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,520
Next time you come
to bring the rent...

50
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,640
I want you to stay and
see the bible movie, eh?

51
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,700
Okay, I have two
free tickets here.

52
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,150
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

53
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,220
Bible movie and comedy.
Nobody's going to the theater, huh?

54
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,350
I-I throw in a free popcorn
and soda!

55
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,130
Oh, no, Burgassi,
there's two s's there!

56
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,210
Come on!

57
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,560
Two s's, Mardi Grass!
Mardi Grass!

58

61
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,030
Come on!
I'm here already.

62
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,540
You gotta learn
to be on time.

63
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,090
Hey, what you doing?

64
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,580
- Don't cut in, dummy!
- Leave her alone, woman.

65
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,690
I was keeping her place.

66
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,180
I get reported, I come
after you and the mute.

67
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,900
You do that, Yolanda.

68
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,470
You do that.

69
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,390
Ugh.

70
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,570
My feet are already killin' me.

71
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,020
I made Brewster pigs in a
blanket tonight before leavin'.

72
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,310
And boy, he just ate 'em up.

73
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,060
No thank you's, no yum yums.
Not a peep.

74
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,840
Man is as silent as a grave.

75
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,940
But if farts were flattery,

76
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,570
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

77
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,150
Then I get home
and I make him breakfast.

78
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,570
Eggs, bacon, and buttered toast.

79
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,610
I butter the man's toast, Elisa.

80
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,640
Mm-hmm, both sides.
As if he was a child.

81
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,340
And I don't even get a "Thank you."

82
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,950
You'd be grateful

83
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,900
because you're an
educated woman.

84
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,800
But my Brewster?
All he had going for him

85
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,050
was animal magnetism
back in the day.

86
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,560
Hadn't worked in a while.

87
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,330
What in the Sam Hill?

88
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,510
Lou!

89
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,560
You boys mind putting
the trash in the can?

90
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,060
That's what it's there for.

91
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,610
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

92
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,590
All right, all right. Sorry Zelda.
Sorry.

93
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,220
I don't know what they're doin'.

94
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,990
Makin' a goddamn mess
is what I'd say...

95
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,970
Zelda!

96
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,230
- Stop the chatter please.
- Yes, Sir.

97
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,490
And there's no call
for the blasphemy.

98
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,200
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

99
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,220
Mhmm, a moment of your time.

100
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,080
Today, we are receiving a new
team and asset here in T-4.

101
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,900
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler
from our sister facility in Galveston.

102
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,910
Now, I don't want to bolster or...

103
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,730
overstate the matter but...

104
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,990
this may very well be the
most sensitive asset

105
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,460
ever to be housed
in this facility.

106
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,830
- How was your trip?
- Fine.

107
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,620
- Who's security here?
- Just one moment, please.

108
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,090
Security! Who's security?

109
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,810
Welcome to the T-4, Sir.

110
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,040
I'm Fleming, head of security.

111
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,630
Any questions you have
or concerns you can refer to me.

112
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,940
Understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

113
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,770
Get them out.

114
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,190
Help me move the cylinder
into the compressor.

115
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,950
Bring it here, bring it here.

116
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
Bring it over here.

117
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
We need to pressurize
it immediately.

118
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,530
Elisa, Elisa!

119
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,990
Come on.

120
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,340
Lord, what goes on
in this place?

121
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,990
Did you see that?

128

Yes, I'm wearing the hairpiece.
How's it look?

129
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,350
Oh, careful, the car.

130
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,770
It's not a hairpiece, it's a toupée.
It's French.

131
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,880
It's eternal, see?

132
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,170
Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death.

133
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,700
'Cause the fruit on the branches
was just always out of his reach.

134
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,140
And the water in the stream
receded every time he

135
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,530
stooped down to drink.

136
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,860
And so, that's why
we say things today, like...

137
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,540
look at those tantalizing pies.

138
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,440
Thank you.
Y’all come back now, y’hear?

139
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,480
Yes, pies for breakfast.
Just trust me on this.

140
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,010
Hey, folks, welcome to
Dixie Doug's.

141
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,600
I've seen you
in here before, right?

142
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,410
Yes, I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.

143
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,030
Partial to key lime pie?

144
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,820
I am, I am. Two to go.

145
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,630
Just go with it, please, please.

146
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,030
Uh, I uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.

147
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,100
It can't possibly be good for me
but nothing I like is.

148
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,890
No, no, it's a mighty fine pie,
key lime.

149
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,260
You wouldn't happen
to be the uh,

150
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,870
famous Dixie Doug
himself, would you?

151
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,440
Heck, no. Pies are trucked
throughout the country.

152
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,340
They call it uh,
"franchising", see?

153
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,090
Oh.

154
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,860
They give us the
spinners, the signage.

155
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,860
That there's "Pie Boy", our mascot.

156
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,980
I don't talk like that.
I'm from Ottawa.

157
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,360
No.

158
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,320
I completely bought it.

159
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,850
"That's-a great-a pie."

160
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,990
The...

161
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,350
The uh, the little-little guy.
Is he supposed to be Italian?

162
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,990
I guess so.

163
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,670
That was very clever.

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,640

167
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,040

168
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,520
Do you think he meant it?

169
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,950
He had noticed me.
I mean, you s... you heard that.

170
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,220
This pie is rather sordid.

171
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,700
Don't spit it out.

172
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,390
Next time we go,
we'll just try a different flavor.

173
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,660
Hmm?

174
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,980
Save it for later.
For the wait.

175
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,220
<i>The clocks point to 6 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time.</i>

Oh, dear God, change
that awfulness.

180
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,540
I do not want to see that.

181
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,530
I do not want to see it.

182
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,820

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,320
Oh, look at Betty!

185
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,590
Oh, to be young and beautiful.

186
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,450
If I could go back...

187
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,120
to when I was 18...

188
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,560
I didn't know anything
about anything...

189
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,190
I'd give myself a bit of advice.

190
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,280
I would say,

191
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,310
take better care
of your teeth and fuck.

192
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,660
A lot more.

193
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,540
Oh, no, no, that's
very good advice.

Will you look at this?

197
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,690
Look.

198
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,820
Some of the best
minds in the country

199
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,040
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

200
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,150
Mm-mm-mm.

201
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,680
There's pee freckles
on the ceilin' there!

202
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,530
How'd they get it up there?

203
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,870
Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?

204
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,840
They get enough practice
that’s for sure.

205
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,490
My Brewster...

206
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,970
no one's ever called
him a great mind

207
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,090
but...

208
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,770
even he manages to hit the can
seventy percent of the time.

209
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,900
- Excuse us, Sir.
- No, no, no. That's all right.

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,430
Go ahead.

211
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,380
You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.

212
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,610
Girl talk no doubt.

213
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,820
Don't mind me.

214
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,260
Elisa...

215
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,850
Look, don't touch.

216
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,750
That lovely dingus right there
is an Alabama howdy-do.

217
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,010
Molded grip handle.

218
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,080
Low-current, high-voltage
electric shock cattle prod.

219
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,520
Name's Strickland. Security.

220
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,300
Fleming's security.

221
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,690
Ha!

222
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,250
Oh, no, no. A man
washes his hands

223
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,370
before or after
tending to his needs.

224
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,370
It tells you a lot about a man.

225
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,510
He does it both times...

226
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,440
Points to a weakness in character.

227
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,320
Ladies.

228
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,300
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

229
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,660
Short people are mean.

230
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,430
I never met a short man that
stayed nice all the way through.

231
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,100
No, sir.

232
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,410
Mean little backstabbers,
all of 'em.

233
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,150
Maybe it's the air down there.

234
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,980
Not enough oxygen or somethin'.

235
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,550
Hmm.

236
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,300
Help! He's losing blood!

237
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,240
Help!

238
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,540
Come on, come on.

239
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,200
You think the Russians broke in?

240
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,870
I don't think so.
And if they did...

241
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,300
Duane’s meatloaf will
kill them all, honey.

242
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,220
It was two shots.
D'you hear 'em?

243
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,440
All right, three.

244
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,600
And that scream.

245
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,240
Lord, whatever happens
in this place.

246
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,350
You two, come with me.

247
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,650
Right now? Mr. Fleming, Sir?

248
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,880
Any chance we could...
conclude our dinner?

249
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,740
Now.

250
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,910
Oh, heavens to Betsy.
We are in a pickle.

251
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,970
We are in such a pickle.

252
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,630
You will have exactly 20 minutes

253
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,500
to render this-this lab
immaculate

254
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,200
and so on and so forth.
20 minutes.

255
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,430
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

256
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,220
I can handle pee.

257
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,760
I can handle poo.

258
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,460
But blood, mm.

259
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,580
Blood just <i>does</i> somethin' to me.

260
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,010
Here, honey...
help me mop it up.

261
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,910
The sooner we get outta
here, the better.

262
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,460
Is that a tater tot?

263
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,470
Oh!

264
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,150
It's a finger.

265
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,460
It's two fingers, okay.

266
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,530
Okay, okay. Put 'em away, and...
just wait here.

267
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm gonna get Mr. Fleming.

268
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,360
Where are these body parts?

269
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,690
The body parts?

270
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,390
No, I believe you, honey.
Are you sure it was alive?

271
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,020
Because I saw a mermaid
once in a carnival tent.

272
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,670
And it was a monkey

273
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,500
sewn to the tail of a fish.
Looked real to me!

274
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,700
All right, I apologize.

275
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,890
I have a deadline.

276
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,150
You know, uh...

277
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,900
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

278
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,250
Didn't work.

279
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,940
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

280
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,790
She was a huge star, huge.

281
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,820
And one day, she couldn't take the
bullshit and the backstabbing anymore,

282
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,460
she just walked away from it all.

283
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Ta-da.

284
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,450
It's not bad, is it?

285
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,010
For being shit.

286
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,600
Uh, listen, you eat, you
go to bed, you rest.

287
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,580
And when I...
get paid...

288
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,660
We get pie.

289
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,230
No, we don't get pie.
I get pie.

290
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,000
You get whatever you want.

291
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,330

299
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,240
They want the gelatin
to be green now.

300
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,700
- I was told red.
- New concept.

301
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,880
That's the future now. Green.

302
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,280
Oh, and they want the...
them happier-the family.

303
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,210
- Happier? Happier?
- Mm.

304

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,240
Well, uh, what are they
supposed to be happy about?

307
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,970
The client wanted photographs.
I sold them on this.

308
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,310
It's too bad. This is
nice work.

309
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,140
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

310
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,370
How you holdin' up?

311
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,710
- You drinking?
- No.

312
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,090
Not a drop. No.

313
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,030
Getting any work since
you left Klein & Saunders?

314
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,360
You mean since I was
asked to leave by you.

315
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,670
We are not getting into this now.

316
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,710
I want to come back, Bernie.

317
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,520
We'll see.

318
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,380
Now do this.

319
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,500
Good work.

320
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,710

321
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,350

322
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,060
Cleaning, huh.

323
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,440
Listen, honey.

324
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,640
Mr. "I pee with my hands on my
hips" wants to see us both.

325
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,830
Zelda D. Fuller.

326
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,140
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

327
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,130
Uh, about ten years, Sir.

328
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,860
No siblings, Zelda?

329
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,210
No, Sir.

330
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,690
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

331
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,670
My momma died after me.

332
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,500
After I was born.

333
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,730
What does that "D" stand for?

334
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,110
Delilah... Sir.

335
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,800
On account of the bible.

336
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,030
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

337
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,490
Lulled him to sleep.
Cut his hair.

338
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,520
Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him.

339
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,740
Burned his eyes out.

340
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,200
Guess my momma didn’t read
the good book close enough.

341
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,680
And you...

342
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,750
Elisa... Esposito.

343
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,810
Doesn’t Esposito mean "orphan"?

344
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,300
Oh, Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam.

345
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,120
They found her by the river...
in the water.

346
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,270
It was you
that found my fingers.

347
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,600
Oh.

348
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,120
Thanks.

349
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,270
Three hours in surgery.

350
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,370
They rebuilt the first phalanx here.

351
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,990
Sutured the tendons.

352
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,820
Don't know if it's
gonna take or not.

353
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,360
There was mustard on them.

354
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,380
- A paper bag?
- It was all we had, Sir.

355
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,060
I answer mostly, on account
that she can't talk.

356
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,590
She can't? She deaf?

357
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,700
Mute, Sir.

358
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,880
She said she can hear you.

359
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,490
Oh, those scars on your neck.

360
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,560
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

361
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,530
She said since she was a baby.

362
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,280
Who would do that to a baby?

363
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,720
The world is sinful.

364
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,760
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

365
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,100
Well, let me say this upfront.

366
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,150
You clean that lab.
You get out.

367
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,130
The thing we keep in there,
is an affront.

368
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,210
Do you know what an
affront is, Zelda?

369
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,180
Something offensive.

370
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,350
That's right. And I should know,
I dragged that...

371
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,330
filthy thing...

372
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,800
out of the river muck in South
America all the way here.

373
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,940
And along the way, we didn’t
get to like each other much.

374
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,930
Now... you may think...

375
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,860
that thing looks human.

376
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,460
Stands on two legs, right?

377
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,620
But, we're created
in the Lord's image.

378
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,910
You don’t think that’s what the
Lord looks like, do you?

379
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,900
I wouldn’t know, Sir.
What the Lord looks like.

380
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,900
Well, human, Zelda. He looks
like a human. Like me.

381
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,060
Or even you.

382
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
Maybe a little more
like me, I guess.

383
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,720
Well, that's all.

384
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,030
General Hoyt. Thank you
for calling me back, Sir.

385
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,470
<i>- Feeling better?</i>
- Oh, yes, Sir, much better.

386
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,050
- Pain pills, is all.
<i>- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>

387
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,250
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

388
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,050
But I still got my thumb,
my trigger and my pussy finger.

389
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,960
<i>Sounds to me like you'll
be all right then.</i>

390
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,680
Yes, Sir, that's right.
Looking forward to your visit, Sir.

391
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,240
Decisions need to be
made about the asset.

392
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,370
<i>Some fruity pies await you.</i>

393
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,510
<i>Three new locations in
downtown Baltimore.</i>

394
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,930
<i>The future is here.</i>

395
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,440
Get some rest.

396
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,440
Pick me up at 9:30.

397
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,410
21:30 hours. Yes, Sir.

398
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,320
<i>Dixie Dougs.
That's-a great-a pie.</i>

399
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,100
I'm home.

400
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,260
I made you an omelette.

401
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,370
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

402
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,410
I’ve gone through half the boxes,
and I can’t find the griddle.

403
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,120
Guess what?

404
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,150
I made you cheese and
broccoli omelette.

405
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,280
How're you feeling?
Does it hurt?

406
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,640
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

407
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,330
- What?
- We're burying a time capsule.

408
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,380
At the new school.
I wanted to ask you.

409
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,550
Do you think we'll
all have jet packs?

410
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,100
- In the future?
- Believe it, son.

411
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,660
Oh, bus is here.

412
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,370
This is America.

413
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,260
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

414
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,680
Finish you omelette then
wash your hands real good

415
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,290
and come upstairs, sweetie.

416
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,540
I kinda like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

417
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,900
Plus, D.C. is just half
an hour away, isn’t it?

418
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,900
It’s still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

419
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,460
You know what I'm thinkin'?

420
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm thinkin'...
I need a new car.

421
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,040
You need a new car, do you?

422
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,430
How about a Cadillac, Mister?

423
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,650
Richard.

424
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh.

425
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,500
Oh.

426
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,850
Oh, Richard.

427
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,900
Uh.

428
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,080
Oh. Uh.

429
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,100
Oh.

430
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,410
Swee... sweetie?

431
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,520
Sweetie, you're um...

432
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,600
Your-your hand, it's bleeding.

433
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,870
Silence, stop talking.

434
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,730
Don't talk. I want you in silence.

435
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,470
Silent. Silent.

436
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,570
Yes... yes, silence.

Elisa, hurry, hurry.
Come on.

462
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,610
Sweet God, girl.

463
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,940
You're doing it again, Zelda.

464
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,910
Oh, give it a rest, Yolanda.

465
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,890
Oh!

466
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,130
Whew!

467
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,730
Hey, Zelda, want a smoke?

468
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,090
- That shit ain't good for you, Duane.
- Yeah, but it feel good.

469
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,520
It does, doesn't it?

470
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,090
Come on, Elisa, just one.

471
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,750
Come on, come on, come on.

472
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,830
Don't worry 'bout that camera.
We push him up at break time.

473

- Mmhmm.
- This here's a blind spot.

Aw, you miss me, huh?

477
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,760
I took a candy break.

478
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,410
This is what scares you, huh?

479
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,410
Gee, you should be
used to it by now.

480
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,150
There you go again,
makin' that god-awful sound.

481
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,690
Is that you cryin', huh?
Is that what it is?

482
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,100
Are you hurtin'?

483
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,200
Or maybe...

484
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,830
you're angry?!

485
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,750
Maybe you'd like to get
another bite, huh? Go ahead.

486
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,810
Huh?!

487
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,570
I can't tell!

488
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,910
I mean, are you beggin'?

489
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,410
'Cause to me, it's just the worst
fucking noise I ever heard.

490
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,930
<i>Paging Captain Walters.</i>

491
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,930
<i>Captain Walters. Please
pick up the courtesy phone.</i>

492
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,510
Elisa...

493
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,690
Elisa?

494
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,570
General Hoyt! Welcome, Sir.

495
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,610
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, Sir.

496
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,440
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

497
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,000
Good God Almighty.
Is that it?

498
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,720
Hell of a lot bigger
than I thought.

499
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,260
Ugly as sin.

500
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,900
You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshipped it like a God.

501
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,420
Doesn’t look like much of
a God right now, does it?

502
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,340
Well, they were primitives, Sir.

503
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,370
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

504
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,290
Flowers, fruits, crap like that.

505
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,400
Then they tried to stop the
oil drill with bows and arrows.

506
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,890
That didn’t turn out too well.

507
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,760
He's bleeding.

508
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,040
What happened?

509
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,060
It’s an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keepin' it tame.

510
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,800
"Oxygen osmosis and
dioxide exchange."

511
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,580
What the hell
have we got here, Son?

512
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,730
This creature, Sir...

513
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,130
It can alternate between two entirely
separate breathing mechanisms.

514
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,130
- Mudskipper can do that.
- No.

515
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,540
Look, you want to
put a man in space.

516
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,510
He’s gonna have
to endure conditions

517
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,330
the human body just
wasn’t made for.

518
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,690
This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.

519
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,480
How long can it breathe
outside the water?

520
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,520
The reality is, Sir, we don't
know jackshit about this thing.

521
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,620
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

522
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,370
Those cockeyed bastards.

523
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,120
You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space...

524
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,480
And we get a good laugh.

525
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,820
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up.

526
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,720
A Ruskie, orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what?

527
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,540
Who’s laughing then?
Krushchev, that's who.

528
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,680
We let him put a dog up
into space...

529
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,930
and he laughs then puts
a commie up in space.

530
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,660
And he laughs, and then he puts
missiles into Cuba.

531
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,600
Have we learned nothing?

532
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,650
Sir, we need to get him
back in the water.

533
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,770
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, Sir.

534
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,870
They fall in love
with their playthings.

535
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,230
Now, right here, see,
along the middle?

536
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,860
This creature has a
thick, jointed cartilage

537
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,140
that separates the primary
and secondary lungs.

538
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,790
Am I explaining this
correctly, Bob?

539
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,170
Yes, but we have

540
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
- been able to determine...
- It makes the X-rays inconclusive.

541
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,660
In principle, Sir, yes, but...

542
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,980
- there are ways of...
- Now, I believe, if we wanna

543
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,750
get the edge on the Soviets,
we need to vivisect this thing.

544
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,590
No, no.

545
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,170
- Take it apart, learn how it works.
- No.

546
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,430
No! That would
defeat the purpose!

547
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,370
Sir, he's passed out, please.

548
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,680
Put him in the tank!
Let him pressurize.

549
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,870
General Hoyt, Sir!

550
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,220
You cannot, under any
circumstance, kill this creature.

551
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,870
Count these stars with me, Son.

552
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,620
There're five of 'em.

553
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,840
Means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

554
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,290
Now, you wanna plead your case?
I’ll listen to it.

555
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,000
But at the end of the day...

556
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,170
it is my damn decision.

557
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,150
So crack the damn thing open.

558
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,660
Learn what you can
and close up shop here.

559
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,700
And give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

560
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,760
- You've done it.
- Thank you, Sir.

561
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,900
Now, hurry up and
finish the job, son.

562
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,500
Absolutely, Sir.

563
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,110
Get him out?
What are you talking about?

564
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,480
No, absolutely not.

565
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,700
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

566
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,930
Probably breaking the law
just talking about it.

567
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,670
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

568
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,650
Now, does this mean that...

569
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,400
whenever we go to a
Chinese restaurant,

570
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,710
you want to save
every fish in the tank?

571
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,650
So what if he's alone?

572
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,070
We're all alone.

573
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,140
"The loneliest thing
you've ever seen."

574
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,910
Well, you just said it,
right, you just said it.

575
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,010
You called it a "thing."
It's a thing. It's a freak.

576
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,670
I can understand you.

577
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,330
Calm down.

578
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,570
God, calm d...

579
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,840
All right, I-I will repeat it to you.

580
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,830
"What am I?"

581
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,230
"I move my mouth."

582
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,970
"Like him."

583
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,010
"I make no sound."

584
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,240
"Like him."

585
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,600
"What does that make me?"

586
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,450
"All that I am..."

587
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,130
"All that I've ever been..."

588
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,260
"brought me here"

589
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,630
"to him."

590
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:23,750
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

591
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,830
It's a h...

592
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,050
Ah! You just hit me.

593
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,980
Elisa, let go of me.

594
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,020
I'm looking, I'm looking.
You've never... hit me!

595
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,340
"When he looks at me..."

596
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,730
"The way he looks at me..."

597
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,820
"He does not know..."

598
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,930
"what I lack..."

599
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,020
"or..."

600
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,260
"how..."

601
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,970
"I am incomplete."

602
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,160
"He... sees me..."

603
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,410
"for what I... am..."

604
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,310
"as I am."

605
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,280
"He's happy."

606
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,210
"To see me."

607
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,760
"Every time."

608
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,940
"Everyday."

609
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,710
"Now..."

610
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,390
"I can... either..."

611
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,110
"save him..."

612
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,290
"or let him die."

613
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,120
Okay.

614
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:29,900
I'm leaving.

615
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,710
I have to... I have to leave.

616
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,640
Just, Elisa, please stop.

617
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,320
Listen to me, just listen to me.

618
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,480
I have to go.

619
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,840
I have to... I'm leaving now
because this...

620
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,300
Elisa, this is
very important to me.

621
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,870
This is a second chance for me.

622
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,680
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

623
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,050
Oh, God.

624
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,070
When I come back,

625
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,840
we just will not talk
about this ever again.

626
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,550
Elisa, there's...

627
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,060
Oh, all right.

628
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,630
What are we?
What are you and I?

629
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,410
Do you know what we are?
We are nothing.

630
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,840
Nothing. We can do nothing.

631
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,570
I'm sorry.

632
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,930
But this, this,
this is just...

633
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,690
Oh, God, it's not even human.

634
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,710
God.

635
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,260
What?

636
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,570
Giles!

637
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,870
I've been waiting.

638
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,620
- I know, sorry.
- It's okay.

639
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,350
We going in?

640
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,630
You should’ve just
mailed the art.

641
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,780
No. I want to show it to you
and the team in person.

642
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,240
I think it's
some of my best work.

643
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,320
And it's green as can be.

644
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,110
It's uh, it's not a good time.

645
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,820
Maybe later.

646
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,500
Oh, well, sure.
No problem.

647
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,710
What would be a
good time for you, Bernie?

648
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,750
You painted that?

649
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,070
Yeah.

650
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,960
Wowee.

651
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,590
You're good.

652
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,760
Well, apparently, not as
good as a photograph.

653
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,550
But it is good, isn’t it?

654
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,570
I couldn't paint
anything like that.

655
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,720
Here... on me.

656
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,060
For me?

657
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,690
We don't get many
like you in here.

658
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,540
You seem...
very educated.

659
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,180
I like talkin' to you.

660
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,350
The-the thing is, that's the...

661
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,540
The only reason that
I come in here is...

662
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,450
The conversation! And...

663
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,590
The pie is mighty fine too, isn't it?

664
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,800
Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,400
It's no key lime, but...
it's good.

666
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,510
You know I work alone...

667
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,460
and uh...

668
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,330
my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

669
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,320
You see, that's part of
being the job here, it's like...

670
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,630
being a bartender.

671
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,380
You serve people pie,
you listen to their problems.

672
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,670
You get to know 'em.

673
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,950
I'd like to
get to know you better.

674
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,510
The hell are you doing, old man?

675
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,590
Oh, o-o-oh.

676
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,450
Hey, no, no, no.
Not the counter.

677
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,860
Take out only.
You can't sit there.

678
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,850
You want something,
you order, you take it out.

679
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:24,850
But it's empty...
the-the counter's empty...

680
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:27,170
They're all reserved all day.
You don't sit down.

681
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,220
Y'all come back now,
y'hear?

682
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,170
You didn't need to
talk to them like that.

683
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,560
You should go too.

684
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:42,030

Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

706
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:44,600
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

707
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,300
- I'm just idling around.
- And I'm just talking.

708
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,120
AM radio, air conditioner,

power steering, power seats...

710

All deluxe interior
appointment choices.

711
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,050
143 options. Now this...

712

Hm.

714
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,000
I'm not sure about the green.

715
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,560
No, it's not green, my friend.
Teal.

716
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,750
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

717
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,780
It's a limited edition.
Twelve coats of paint.

718
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,950
Polished by hand. All
authentic chrome detailing.

719
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,180
Four out of five successful men
in America drive a Cadillac.

720
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,690
- Is that a fact?
- This here is the future.

721

And you strike me as a man

Teal.

00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,610
Teal.

747
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,570
- Tomorrow...
- Mmm?

00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,860

down the loading ramp.

756
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,220
And uh, the shifts are
changing and I...

757
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,640
How much time do I have?

758

I'll remember, yeah,

759
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,890
Five a.m., five minutes,
five-five, five-five.

760
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,700
So, y-you're gonna
move the cameras, right.

761
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,500
And uh, I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watches.

762
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,060
Just like they do in the movies.

763
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,850
Oh, God, I'm so proud of you.

764
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,230
God! You just-you're not afraid!

765
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,940
You are? Very?

766
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,800
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

767
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,170
I think this is
some of my best work.

768
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,010
"Michael Parker" is a good

769
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,570
trustworthy name.
It's a little butch.

770
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,350
Yes, age fifty-one.

771
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,790
Fifty four.

772
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,810
You don't have to be rude.

773
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,270
Fifty... seven.

774
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,970
I put the hair on.
I can pull it off.

775
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,730
I can wear this
or a hat.

776
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,670
Oh, Thor, go, go,
off, off, off, off. Go, go.

777
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,260
Or I have this.
Now this...

778
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,050
This I think it says, "Working Man."

779
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,880
But this, now this,
this says...

780
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,510
This says, with the
butterscotch tie...

781
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,160
This says, "Casual"
but still stylish.

782
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,350
So... you like this?
I agree. I agree.

783
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,860
I think we're ready.

784
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,810
Mr. Strickland!

785
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,370
Sally, could you call Miss Esposito
to clean up a spill?

786
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,320
You know, I can't
figure it out myself.

787
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,220
You're not much to look at, but...

788
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,360
Go figure.

789
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,200
I keep thinking about you.

790
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,540
And when you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent, or...

791
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,100
do you squawk a little?

792
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:17,220
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty... hmm?

793
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,680
I just want you to know...

794
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,330
I don't mind those scars.

795
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:28,920
I don't mind that you
can't speak, either.

796
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,300
When you come
right down to it...

797
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,580
I like it.

798
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,710
A lot.

799
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,310
Kind of gets me going.

800
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:48,780
I bet I can make you
squawk a little.

801
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,040
Hey, honey, you okay?

802
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,310
Hurry up,
I want to be home early.

803
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,280
My feet are killing me.

804
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:56,500
We need to delay the procedure.

805
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,360
Knock before
you enter my office.

806
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,760
This is urgent!

807
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,920
Go back out. Knock.

808
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,480
Then I'll let you in
and we'll talk.

809
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,550
That’s the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

810
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:13,950
Come in.

811
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,800
I...

812
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,410
Could you get the
door for me, please?

813
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,160
See? That's the way.
Now we talk.

814
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,550
I need more time.

815
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,120
Don't let the fact that
you feel like a loser now,

816
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,910
that you let your
competitive tendency...

817
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,960
I'm not competitive!

818
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,310
I don't want an intricate,
beautiful thing destroyed.

819
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,080
This thing dies.
You learn. I leave.

820
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,230
Outta here. I settle down.

821
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,970
My family settles down.
Somewhere nice. A real city.

822
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,660
This creature is intelligent.

823
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,430
Capable of language...

824
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,300
of understanding emotions.

825
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,300
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

826
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,330
And we still kill them, don't we?

827
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,980
The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zoo.

828
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:14,850
And I don't want to be in this
shithole any longer than need be.

829
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,230
Do you?

830
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,110
Bob...

831
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,460
Do you?

832
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,470
No, I don't.

833
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,860
Hey, what are you waiting for?

834
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,100
Have you seen Elisa?

835
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,950
Come on, Zelda.

836
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,000
Did you move the camera?
On the loading dock?

837
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,090
Is that where you're taking him?
Through the service tunnels?

838
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,730
That's very smart.

839
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,050
Who do you work for?

840
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,550
This water must be kept at
five to eight percent salinity.

841
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:38,020
Table salt will do.

842
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,130
Mix one of these in his water
every three days.

843
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,470
Raw protein diet is a must.

844
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:49,620
In five minutes, I'll meet you
at the loading dock.

845
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,330
The lights will go out,
so be prepared.

846
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,640
M-Mr. Strickland, sir...

847
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,910
Twelve hours to the
vivisection of the asset, and to...

848
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,220
I-I need your signature
here, please.

849
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,970
<i>this sudden clandestine decision</i>

850
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,150
<i>to station strategic
weapons for the first time</i>

851
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,980
<i>outside of Soviet soil...</i>

852
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,400
Hold it right there.

853
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,970
<i>and unjustified change
in the status quo...</i>

854
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,540
<i>which cannot be accepted
by this country,</i>

855
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,720
Michael Parker. Is that you?

856
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,530
My whole life.

857
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,250
Are you out of your mind?

858
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,260
Don't do this, Elisa.

859
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,920
Don't do this!

860
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:28,060
What's that...
What's that vehicle?

861
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,460
Uh, gosh, sir, I'm not sure, it's...
A laundry van?

862
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,260
B-But it's-it's not scheduled.

863
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:42,390
<i>and finally, I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev</i>

864
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,590
<i>to halt and eliminate</i>

865
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,070
<i>this clandestine, reckless</i>

866
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,050
<i>and provocative
threat to world peace</i>

867
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,180
<i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>

868
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,120
Sir!

869
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:00,960
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

870
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,630
- Sir, what do you need me to...
- Get backup.

871
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,920
- Step out of the vehicle, sir.
- Oh, God, I'm not good at this.

872
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,370
Out of the vehicle, now!

873
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,550
I will not say it again.

874
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,010
- God, please don't shoot me.
- Get out!

875
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,390
Oh, God, don't shoot me.

876
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,060
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time.

877
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:30,670
Get out now!

878
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:34,100
We have to go. Hurry!

879
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,220
Oh, woman, we're
gonna burn in hell!

880
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,720
Come on, push!

881
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,080
Push!

882
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,330
Push!

883
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,410
I swear I'm not doing
this on purpose.

884
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,870
Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!

885
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,650
What?

886
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,270
She's waiting for you
at the dock.

887
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,680
- Go! Now!
- Okay, I will.

888
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:10,890
Who's that man?
I think he just killed someone.

889
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,710
Oh!

890
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,110
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

891
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,460
Are we ready? Are we ready?

892
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,400
He's so beautiful.

893
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,390
Huh?!

894
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,730
Oh! Uh!

895
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,730
Did I do that?

896
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,740
I'm just not good at this.

897
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:55,600
Move! Move!

898
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,650
No...

899
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,020
No!

900
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,330
Salt? What are you talking
about? Salt.

901
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,170
Elisa!

902
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:23,900
Israeli "Popper."

903
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,630
Smell the magnesium.

904
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,810
The Russians hate the Jews,

905
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,770
but can’t get enough
of their gadgets.

906
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,050
How'd they get in here?

907
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,340
Oh, uh, forged ID, painted plates,
and uh, so on and so forth.

908
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,030
and they moved the main video
camera on the dock, sir.

909
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,010
Well, no one has to know.
We got 24 hours

910
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,900
- before I bounce it up.
- I called it in.

911
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:50,280
- You called it in?
- The moment it happened, I-I-I...

912
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,400
Mr. Strickland, Sir.

913
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,360
What is it, Sally?

914
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,910
Sir, General Hoyt
is on the phone.

915
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,880
<i>That thing was our
space dog, Strickland.</i>

916
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,310
<i>- You know that.</i>
- Sir, I'm getting it back.

917
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:07,860
I don't... I can't be in a
negative frame of mind, Sir.

918
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,280
<i>So you're feeling good?</i>

919
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,300
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

920
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,090
<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i>

921
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,930
<i>For me, Son.
For me.</i>

922
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,160
♪ Oh, Shenandoah, ♪

923
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:50,470
♪ I long to hear you ♪

924
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,130
♪ Away ♪

925
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,340
That's when you're
planning on releasing him?

926
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:01,930
On the tenth?

927
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,270
So what if the rains are late?

928
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,000
What happens with the canal?

929
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,700
All right.

930
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,050
What's that?

931
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,310
Let me see it.

932
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,020
Is that for me?

933
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,630
Yeah. That's good.
Keep that up.

934
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,130
Lookin' like
you don't know anything.

935
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,340
Lord help me
if they ask me if I do.

936
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,390
I'm not a good liar.

937
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,140
Except to Brewster.

938
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,400
It takes a lotta lies
to keep a marriage goin'.

939
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,250
<i>All personnel: Prepare to present
your identity and clearance cards.</i>

940
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:21,000
Lord. What in the...

941
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:29,160
We done got this.
No word about the trouble.

942
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,140
My opinion, we're looking at
a highly trained group, Sir.

943
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,100
I'm thinking, conceivably, Sir...

944
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:36,600
Special Forces or
so on so forth.

945
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,350
Red Army Special Forces?

946
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,400
Conceivably. I-I mean,
they're highly-trained.

947
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,700
Well-financed. An elite group.

948
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,920
Highly efficient. Ruthless.
Clockwork precision.

949
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,840
Infiltration took less
than five minutes, Sir.

950
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,870
My conservative estimate is
that this was a strike force

951
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,470
of at least ten men.

952
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,610
Have you always been alone?

953
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:16,130
Did you ever have someone?

954
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:19,950
Do you know what happened to you?
Do you?

955
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:22,140
Because I don't. I don't
know what happened to me.

956
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,530
I-I don't know.

957
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:27,040
I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognize

958
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,540
are these eyes.

959
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,470
In this old man's face.

960
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,990
You know, sometimes I think

961
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,880
I was either born too early
or too late for my life.

962
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:45,610
Maybe we're both just relics.

963
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,980
<i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>

964
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,100
<i>Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

965
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,020
Sir. Got them.

966
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,580
Oh, Zelda, Elisa.

967
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,090
Mm-hmm.

968
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,740
Looks like you two punched
out before the incident.

969
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,020
Still...

970
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,650
If you know something about
what transpired here...

971
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,750
it's your obligation...
to report

972
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:26,770
any detail no matter how
small or trivial it may seem.

973
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:29,550
Trivial means unimportant.

974
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,430
I didn't see nothin'
out of the ordinary, no.

975
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,960
Or trivial.

976
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,760
See, my feet were hurtin'.

977
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,940
What about you?

978
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,110
She didn't see anything.

979
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,050
Hmm.

980
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,310
Hoffstetler. Dr. Hoffstetler...

981
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,990
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

982
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,090
He works there...
doesn't he?

983
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:03,020
I mean in a different way.
Doing something different.

984
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:06,250
Something trivial?

985
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,470
No, Sir.

986
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,390
What am I doing?

987
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,650
Interviewing the fucking help.

988
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,220
The shit cleaners.

989
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,640
The piss wipers.

990
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,080
You two, go ahead. Leave.

991
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,800
What'd you say to me?

992
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,770
What is she saying?

993
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,440
I... I didn't catch it.

994
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,280
What is she saying?!

995
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,680
She-She is saying "Thank you."

996
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,140
Next.

997
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,750
<i>I didn't see you last night.</i>

998
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,730
<i>Or the night before.</i>

999
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:40,990
<i>I'm sorry, Ed, but now that I'm
spending all day at the office</i>

1000
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,700
<i>Carol feels that I should
spend my evenings with her.</i>

1001
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,000
<i>Well, if you spend the
evenings with her,</i>

1002
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,670
<i>when will I see you?</i>

1003
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,190
<i>There's only one
thing left to do.</i>

1004
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,420
<i>Volunteer.</i>

1005
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,970
No, no, no, no, no!

1006
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,450
I want to get home early.

1007
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,190
Brewster's been in a
<i>bad</i> mood lately.

1008
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,600
Holy Jesus!

1009
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,000
What are you doing
standing in the shadows

1010
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,010
of the women's locker room?

1011
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,150
They may be watching me
and there are no cameras here.

1012
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,210
For good reason.

1013
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,120
What if you caught us
at an inconvenient moment?

1014
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,860
I need to know that
he's all right.

1015
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:16,270
- He is.
- When will you release him?

1016
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,380
Soon.

1017
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:20,830
When the rains fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

1018
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,490
If you need anything.

1019
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,750
Release him soon.

1020
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:31,570
What did she say?

1021
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:35,110
She said, you’re a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.

1022
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,230
My name is Dimitri.

1023
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,110
Honored to meet you.

1024
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,850
Hey, Dummy, phone call for you.
It's urgent.

1025
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,220
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

1026
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,100
Believe me, I'm fine.

1027
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:03,060
He ate Pandora.
Wasn't his fault.

1028
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,310
He's a wild creature.

1029
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,010
We can't ask him
to be anything else.

1030
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,760
Elisa, go find him.

1031
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,500
Go. Go!

1032
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:11,240
Go.

1033
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,170
You're lucky.

1034
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,590
Ow.

1035
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:21,270
I stayed awake
as long as I could.

1036
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:24,150
But, you know,
I'm not even mad anymore.

1037
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,330
Is he all right? You sure?

1038
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,320
Where you going?

1039
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:31,800
No, no.

1040
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,550
Okay, don't-no, no. Don't play
with the kitties. No, no.

1041
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,990
Don't play with the kitties.

1042
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,590
I'm not-I'm not angry.
I'm not...

1043
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,440
Huh! Oh, my!

1044
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:57,700
You did that, but it's okay.
Ooh, I don't think that's sanitary.

1045
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,390
Enough.

1046
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:15,140
Interesting guy.

1047
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,490
<i>All personnel: Prepare to present

1048
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:24,040
You wanted to see me?

1049
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:30,240
How's it going?
The investigation?

1050
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:32,810
Well, we have a promising lead.

1051
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,720
Really?

1052
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:38,050
That's good to hear.

1053
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,380
You joined us in Galveston, but

1054
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,870
where were you before, Hoffstetler?

1055
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,820
Doctor.

1056
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:46,640
- Excuse me?
- Doctor Hoffstetler.

1057
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:50,230
Protocol.

1058
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,920
Wisconsin. Madison.

1059
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:57,320
Oh, that's right. You gave up a
tenure track position, didn't you?

1060
01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:01,190
Gave it all up... for us.

1061
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,020
I suppose...

1062
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,950
you’ll be getting ready to
leave us now, then, huh?

1063
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,820
Only it the creature isn't found.

1064
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,510
Well, what do you think?
You think we will find it?

1065
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,910
Well, you said you had a lead.

1066
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:21,270
I do.

I've got water pouring
into my theater!

1111

I have four paying customers,
I can't afford a refund.

01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:29,760

1121
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,220
Oh, look at my arm.

never there. Look at that.

1123
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,700
You said that...

1124
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,390
he was worshipped like a god.

1125
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,890
Now, is he a god? I don’t
know if he's a god.

1126
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,860
I mean, he ate a cat, so
I don’t know, I don't know. But...

1127
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,580
I mean, we have to keep
him around a while.

1128
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,680
A little while.

1129
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,400
Hello?

1130
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,810
Your water, Sir.

1131
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:54,320
And Sir, General Hoyt...

1132
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,850
Mnh-mnh! Mnh-mnh!

1133
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,430
Tell him I'm not here.
Tell him I'll call him back.

1134
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,390
Don't put him through.

1135
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,810
No, Sir!

1136
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:02,650
H-He's in your office.

1137
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,670
At this point, our only
concern is the asset.

1138
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:11,790
- Do you have it?
- Still in the wind, Sir.

1139
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,110
Well, that won't do.

1140
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,470
Yes, Sir. I know.

1141
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,570
You've known me how long, Sir?

1142
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:22,330
Thirteen years.

1143
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:24,800
- Battle of Pusan.
- Yes, Sir.

1144
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,030
A man is faithful, loyal,
efficient all his life.

1145
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:34,500
All of it... and he is... useful.
And he expects...

1146
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:38,610
He has certain
expectations in return.

1147
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,500
And then he fails, once.

1148
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:45,120
Only once.
What does that make him?

1149
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:47,150
Does that make him a failure?

1150
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,830
When is a man done, Sir?
Proving himself?

1151
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:56,870
A good man.

1152
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,490
A decent man.

1153
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:04,280
Decent?

1154
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:12,740
A man has the decency
not to fuck up.

1155
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,460
Now, that's one thing.
That's real decent of him.

1156
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,400
But the other kind of decency...

1157
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,320
it doesn't really matter.

1158
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:24,450
We sell it, but it's an export.

1159
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,800
We sell it because
we don't use it.

1160
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:33,760
Thirty six hours from now,
this entire episode will be over.

1161
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,840
And so will you.

1162
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:42,630
Our universe will have a hole in it
with your outline.

1163
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:48,070
An you will have moved on
to an alternate universe.

1164
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,330
A universe of shit.

1165
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,910
You will be lost to civilization.

1166
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,950
And you will be unborn.

1167
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,670
Unmade.

1168
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,060
And undone.

1169
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:16,700
So, go get some
real decency, Son.

1170
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,590
And unfuck this mess.

1171
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,510
Thirty-six hours.

1172
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,670
Thirty-six hours.
Well, shit, deliver.

1173
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:01,950
That's what you do.
You deliver, right?

1174
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:03,490

Elisa.

1204
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:24,320
What is it, honey?

1205
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:52,760
This isn't good.

1206
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,430
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

1207
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,770
We gotta release him
tonight, honey.

1208
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:03,610
I'll come back and help you.

1209
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:29,590
He's coming out.

1210
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:37,170
Ah, fuck.

1211
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,190
Ah!

1212
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:44,000
Sir, if you don't
mind me saying, you...

1213
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,710
you don't look so well.

1214
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:47,500
Shut up.

1215
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:51,520
Can you smell that? I mean...

1216
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,320
I think it's your fingers, they're
they're...

1217
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:55,760
- black.
- Mmm.

1218
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,290
There he is.

1219
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,550
Doctor fucking shit-bird.

1220
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:06,680
Oh, there's no call
for cursing, Sir.

1221
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:13,040
Get out of the car,
I'm taking it.

1222
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,720
- This is my car.
- Get the fuck out.

1223
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:18,410
Out of my car?

1224
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,640
Did I stutter?

1225
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:44,560
Nyet.

1226
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,070
Nyet. Nyet!

1227
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,160
Strickland! Thank God!

1228
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,030
You were speaking Russian.

1229
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,050
Bob.

1230
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:12,250
- What's your name?
- Hoffstetler.

1231
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:16,110
No, no. Don't lie.
You don't need to.

1232
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:18,800
You took
a bullet to the gut.

1233
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:20,280
You're dead.

1234
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:24,200
I need the names, ranks, and
location of the entire strike team.

1235
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:26,260
Strike team?

1236
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:28,610
The ones who took the asset!

1237
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:41,120
This candy. It's cheap candy.
B-But I love it.

1238
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,070
Ever since I was a kid.

1239
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,770
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks.

1240
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,620
Nougat center and all that
fu-fu shit.

1241
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,500
But not me, Bob.

1242
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:54,990
This is it for me.

1243
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:59,880
Now, sometimes if I'm
feeling anxious...

1244
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,500
I bite right into it.

1245
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,340
But mostly...

1246
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,380
I take my time.

1247
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:07,300
I make it last.

1248
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,240
Names, ranks, and location
of the strike team.

1249
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,190
Names! Ranks! Now!

1250
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,280
No names.

1251
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:31,090
No ranks.

1252
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,180
They...

1253
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:35,810
they just clean.

1254
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:49,130
All right, Brewster,
I'm gonna fix you dinner,

1255
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:52,040
and then I'm gonna run out
for a little while and help a friend.

1256
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:55,860
- Help with what?
- Help a friend.

1257
01:46:58,330 --> 01:46:59,520
Zelda.

1258
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,390
Door.

1259
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,630
Well, you could help me and
answer the door, Brewster.

1260
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:10,180
You're sittin' right here
just ten feet away from it!

1261
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:11,790
My back's achin' me, woman.
Now move!

1262
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,090
Your back. Your back.
Always your back.

1263
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,410
Mr. Strickland?

1264
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,570
What are you doing here?

1265
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:23,530
- Who's that man, Zelda?
- Where is he?

1266
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,210
- What are you talking about?
- Where'd you take him?

1267
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,490
- Zelda.
- What are you talking about?

1268
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:27,540
I-I don't...

1269
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:30,740
The thing...

1270
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,960
in the lab.

1271
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,890
Where is it?

1272
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,930
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1273
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,720
I'm sorry, Sir, if-if-

1274
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:50,090
I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1275
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,310
That story about Samson.

1276
01:47:57,330 --> 01:47:59,570
I never told you how it ends.

1277
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:02,620
After the Philistines torture him...

1278
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:04,400
and blind him...

1279
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:08,950
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1280
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,980
And at the last minute,
he's spared.

1281
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:17,650
And the Lord gives him
his strength back.

1282
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,970
One last time.

1283
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:25,120
And he holds...

1284
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:30,800
the columns of the temple
with his powerful arms

1285
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:33,850
and he crushes them.

1286
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,590
Ah!

1287
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:48,680
And he brings the whole building
down on the Philistines.

1288
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,740
He dies.

1289
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:00,230
But he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1290
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,420
That is his will!

1291
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:11,020
Now, do you know what that
particular story means?

1292
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:13,470
For us, Delilah?

1293
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,740
It means if you know something
you're not telling me,

1294
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,250
you're gonna tell me.

1295
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:21,030
Either before...

1296
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,640
or after...

1297
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:25,510
I bring this particular temple...

1298
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:29,670
down upon our heads.

1299
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:32,440
Gal stole that thing
right out the lab.

1300
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:33,760
Whatever it is.

1301
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,490
Mute girl took it.

1302
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:39,380
I heard my wife
talkin' on the phone about it.

1303
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:47,850
Thank you very much, Mr. Fuller
for your assistance.

1304
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:00,490
What have you done?

1305
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,140
- Zelda.
- I gotta warn her.

1306
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:04,260
He's going after her.

1307
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,370
You will do no
such thing, woman.

1308
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:08,090
Why you worryin' about her?

1309
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,620
She broke the law.

1310
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,710
Shut up, Brewster.

1311
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:12,110
You shut up!

1312
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,120
For years, you don't talk.

1313
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,320
Now you can't shut your mouth.

1314
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:19,970
Damn you, Brewster.

1315
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:23,530
You wouldn't understand.

1316
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:27,560
Couldn't understand. Not if you
tried your whole life.

1317
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:30,740
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Giles, is that you?

1318
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,660
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay, put Elisa on the phone.

1319
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,350
Zelda.

1320
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:37,160
<i>Elisa, honey...</i>

1321
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,240
Make a sound in the phone
if you can hear.

1322
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:41,550
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1323
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,320
He's comin' for you.

1324
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,470
<i>You gotta go now and you gotta
take that thing with you.</i>

1325
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:47,310
What? Elisa?!

1326
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:29,570
Dammit.

1327
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,640
We have to go.

1328
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,320
Where are you?

1329
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:48,830
Where the fuck are you?!

1330
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:13,900
I do not fail.

1331
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:17,060
I deliver.

1332
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:23,190
Elisa!

1333
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:25,730
Elisa.

1334
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:35,940
No!

1335
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:25,290
Fuck.

1336
01:55:26,430 --> 01:55:28,300
You are a God.

1337
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:36,780
<i>If I told you about her...</i>

1338
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:38,420
<i>What would I say?</i>

1339
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:41,350
<i>That they lived
happily ever after?</i>

1340
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:43,610
<i>I believe they did.</i>

1341
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:46,310
<i>That they were in love?</i>

1342
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:48,260
<i>That they remained in love?</i>

1343
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:50,190
<i>I'm sure that's true.</i>

1344
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,390
<i>But when I think of her...</i>

1345
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:55,480
<i>of Elisa...</i>

1346
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:59,550
<i>The only thing that comes
to mind is a poem...</i>

1347
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,730
<i>Whispered by someone in love...</i>

1348
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,880
<i>hundreds of years ago...</i>

1349
01:58:04,570 --> 01:58:07,340
<i>"Unable to perceive
the shape of You...</i>

1350
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:10,570
<i>"I find You all around me.</i>

1351
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:13,320
<i>"Your presence fills my eyes</i>

1352
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:14,890
<i>"with Your love...</i>

1353
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:17,370
<i>"It humbles my heart...</i>

1354
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:19,670
<i>For You are everywhere."</i>
