1
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,566
Give me your hand!

2
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,400
Give me your hand.

3
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:22,557
- I thought you said no more aches or pains.
- It's this darned corset. It binds.

4
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:26,137
No three-way stretch? How very un-chic.

5
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:30,512
You know the police department doctors.
No sense of style.

6
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,850
Anyway, tomorrow will be the day.

7
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,653
What's tomorrow?

8
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,269
The corset comes off tomorrow.

9
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,397
I'll be able to scratch myself tomorrow.

10
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:46,318
I'll throw this miserable thing
out the window. I'll be a free man.

11
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,277
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

12
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:52,616
- More than you think.
- Really?

13
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,579
Do you know that
from personal experience or...

14
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:56,992
Please.

15
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:01,130
- What happens after tomorrow?
- What do you mean?

16
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:05,166
What are you going to do
once you've quit the police force?

17
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,755
- You sound so disapproving, Midge.
- No. It's your life.

18
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:12,255
You were the bright, young lawyer
who decided...

19
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,018
...he was going to be
chief of police someday.

20
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:17,515
- I had to quit.
- Why?

21
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:21,471
Because of this fear of heights I have,
this acrophobia.

22
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:24,351
I wake up at night seeing that man fall
from the roof...

23
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,897
...and I try to reach out to him and...

24
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:30,687
- It wasn't your fault.
- That's what everybody tells me.

25
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:34,814
- Johnny, the doctors explained to you...
- I know, I know.

26
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,859
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.

27
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,284
What a moment to find out I had it.

28
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:46,910
You've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame. So why quit?

29
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,707
You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?

30
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:53,746
- Where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia?

31
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,126
Suppose I'm sitting in this chair,
behind a desk.

32
00:06:57,344 --> 00:06:59,834
A pencil falls from the desk
down to the floor...

33
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:03,298
...and I reach down to pick it up,
bingo, my acrophobia's back.

34
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,891
What'll you do?

35
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:11,104
I'm not gonna do anything for a while.

36
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:15,352
Don't forget, I'm a man
of independent means, as the saying goes.

37
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,900
Fairly independent.

38
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:20,399
Why don't you go away for a while?

39
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:24,021
You mean, to forget?
Midge, don't be so motherly.

40
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,359
I'm not gonna crack up.

41
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:31,318
- Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
- I'm having one right now.

42
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:35,497
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...

43
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,792
What's this doohickey?

44
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,671
It's a brassiere.

45
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,840
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.

46
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,167
I've never run across one like that.

47
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,216
It's brand-new. Revolutionary uplift.

48
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:58,640
No shoulder straps, no back straps,
but does everything a brassiere should do.

49
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,513
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.

50
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,057
It does?

51
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:06,433
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula designed it.

52
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:09,021
He worked it out in his spare time.

53
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,728
Kind of a hobby.

54
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:14,942
A do-it-yourself type of thing.

55
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:19,066
How's your love life, Midge?

56
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,400
That's following a train of thought.

57
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:23,657
Well?

58
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:25,986
Normal.

59
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,538
Aren't you ever gonna get married?

60
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,625
You know there's only one man
in the world for me, Johnny-O.

61
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,913
You mean me.
We were engaged once, weren't we?

62
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,501
- Three whole weeks.
- Good old college days.

63
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:44,425
But you were the one that called off
the engagement, you remember?

64
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:47,513
I'm still available. Available Ferguson.

65
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:52,344
Midge, do you remember a fellow
in college by the name of Gavin Elster?

66
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,140
- Gavin Elster?
- Yes, funny name.

67
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,521
You'd think I would? No.

68
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:03,182
I got a call from Gavin today.
He dropped out of sight during the war.

69
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,112
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.

70
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,648
- It's a Mission number.
- That's Skid Row, isn't it?

71
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,319
Could be.

72
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,241
He's probably on the bum and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.

73
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:19,540
Well, I'm on the bum. I'll buy him
a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.

74
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:22,827
Not tonight. How about you and me
going out for a beer?

75
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,627
Sorry, old man. Work.

76
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:26,787
Then, I think I'll go home.

77
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:33,378
Midge, what'd you mean,
there's no losing it?

78
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:34,881
What?

79
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,512
The acrophobia.

80
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:39,924
I asked my doctor.

81
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:44,560
He said that only another emotional shock
could do it and probably wouldn't.

82
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:47,598
You're not gonna go diving off
another rooftop to find out?

83
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,013
- I think I can lick it.
- How?

84
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,768
I have a theory.

85
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:56,312
I think if I can get used to heights
just a little bit at a time...

86
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:00,109
...just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?

87
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,605
I'll show you what I mean. Here.

88
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,742
I'll show you what I mean.

89
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:08,951
- We'll start with this.
- That?

90
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:12,039
What do you want me to start with,
the Golden Gate Bridge?

91
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,034
Watch this. Here we go.

92
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,456
There.

93
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,796
Now, I look up, I look down.

94
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:27,254
- You're kidding. Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.

95
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,429
- Here.
- That's a girl.

96
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:33,637
I'll use that. Put it right there.

97
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,301
All right, here's the first step.

98
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,687
Okay, now step number two.

99
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,647
Step number two coming up.

100
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,404
There we are.

101
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,697
See? I look up, I look down, I look up...

102
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,867
I'm going right out to buy myself
a nice tall stepladder.

103
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,952
- Take it easy now.
- All right, now here we go.

104
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,955
No problem.

105
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,205
Why, this is a cinch.
I look up, I look down.

106
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,080
I look up, I look down.

107
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:46,024
How did you get in
the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

108
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,360
I married into it.

109
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,069
Very interesting business.

110
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,536
To be honest, I find it dull.

111
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,912
You don't have to do it for a living.

112
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,573
No, but one assumes responsibilities.

113
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,208
My wife's family is all gone.

114
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,993
Someone has to look after her interests.

115
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:08,873
Her father's partner runs the company yard
in the East. Baltimore.

116
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:14,007
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.

117
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:18,465
- I've always liked it here.
- How long have you been back?

118
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,053
Almost a year.

119
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,429
You like it?

120
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:23,894
San Francisco's changed.

121
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:28,763
The things that spell San Francisco
to me are disappearing fast.

122
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:33,433
Like all these.

123
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:36,026
I should have liked to have lived here then.

124
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:38,736
Color, excitement, power.

125
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,398
Freedom.

126
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:44,160
Shouldn't you be sitting down?

127
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:45,905
No, I'm all right.

128
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,451
I was sorry to read about that thing
in the paper. And you've quit the force.

129
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:55,333
- Is it a permanent physical disability?
- No, no.

130
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,959
It just means I can't climb stairs
that are too steep or go to high places...

131
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,506
...like the bar at the Top of the Mark.

132
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:05,298
There are plenty of street-level bars
in this town.

133
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,261
Would you like a drink now?

134
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,472
No, I don't think so.

135
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,971
It's a little early in the day for me.

136
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,770
I guess that covers everything, doesn't it?

137
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,642
I never married,
I don't see much of the old college gang.

138
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,434
I'm a retired detective
and you're in the shipbuilding business.

139
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,238
What's on your mind, Gavin?

140
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:34,194
I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you'd quit detective work...

141
00:13:34,703 --> 00:13:38,949
...but I wondered whether you'd go back
on the job as a special favor to me.

142
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,325
I want you to follow my wife.

143
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,370
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.

144
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:47,871
- Well, then...
- I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

145
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,622
- From whom?
- Someone dead.

146
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:58,217
Scottie, do you believe
that someone out of the past...

147
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:03,432
...someone dead, can enter
and take possession of a living being?

148
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,840
No.

149
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:10,348
If I told you I believe this has happened
to my wife, what would you say?

150
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:14,812
I'd say take her to the nearest psychiatrist
or psychologist...

151
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:18,982
...or neurologist or...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.

152
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,695
I'd have him check on you, too.

153
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:26,150
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

154
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,867
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.

155
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:30,403
Okay.

156
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:34,623
I didn't mean to be that rough.

157
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,326
No, it sounds idiotic, I know.

158
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,878
And you're still the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?

159
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,172
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?

160
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,332
No.

161
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,963
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.

162
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,963
She'll be talking to me about something.

163
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,631
Suddenly the words fade into silence.

164
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:00,602
A cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

165
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:05,730
She's somewhere else, away from me,
someone I don't know.

166
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,142
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.

167
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:12,437
Then, with a long sigh, she's back.

168
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,656
Looks at me brightly.
Doesn't even know she's been away.

169
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,866
Can't tell me where or when.

170
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,080
How often does this happen?

171
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:25,370
More and more in the past few weeks.

172
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,459
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.

173
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,079
I followed her one day...

174
00:15:32,171 --> 00:15:35,920
...watched her coming out
of the apartment, someone I didn't know.

175
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:38,798
She even walked a different way.

176
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:41,386
Got into her car and...

177
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,798
...drove out to Golden Gate Park,
five miles.

178
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:47,761
Sat by the lake...

179
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:51,350
...staring across the water at the pillars
that stand on the far shore.

180
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,762
You know, Portals of the Past.

181
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,852
Sat there a long time without moving.

182
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,808
I had to leave, get back to the office.

183
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:03,527
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

184
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,736
She said she'd driven
to Golden Gate Park...

185
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,946
...and sat by the lake, that's all.

186
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,025
Well?

187
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:15,780
The speedometer on her car showed
that she'd driven 94 miles.

188
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,165
Where did she go?

189
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,460
I've got to know where she goes
and what she does...

190
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,289
...before I get involved with doctors.

191
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,998
- Have you discussed this with the doctors?
- Yes, but carefully.

192
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:32,297
I want to know more
before committing her to that kind of care.

193
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,798
I'll get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you.

194
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,760
- They're dependable, good boys.
- I want you.

195
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,259
Look, this isn't my line.

196
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:44,468
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust.

197
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:46,602
I'm in a panic about this.

198
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,806
I'm supposed to be retired. I don't want
to get mixed up in this darn thing.

199
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,938
Look, we're going to an opening
at the opera tonight.

200
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,397
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.

201
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,111
Ernie's.

202
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,410
Say, will you tell me something?
That lady sitting there.

203
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:32,947
Who's the woman in the painting?

204
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:37,659
<i>That's Carlotta. You'll find it
in the catalog. Portrait of Carlotta.</i>

205
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:39,828
- May I have this?
- Yes.

206
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:38,545
Yes?

207
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:46,143
Is there something I can do for you?

208
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:48,601
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Yes.

209
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:51,815
Would you tell me who has the room
on the second floor...

210
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,857
...in the corner, that corner?

211
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm afraid we couldn't give out information
of that sort.

212
00:29:57,947 --> 00:30:01,197
Our clients are entitled to their privacy,
you know.

213
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,904
And I do believe it's against the law.

214
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:08,617
Of course, I don't think any of them
would mind really, but still I...

215
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,413
Has she done something wrong?

216
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,743
Please answer my question.

217
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:18,246
- I can't imagine that sweet girl...
- What's her name?

218
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:22,542
- Miss Valdés. Spanish, you know.
- Carlotta Valdés?

219
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:24,336
Yeah, that's it.

220
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:26,917
Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign, but sweet.

221
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,590
How long has she had the room?

222
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,882
It must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.

223
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,218
Does she sleep here ever?

224
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,595
No, she just comes to sit
two or three times a week.

225
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:42,144
I don't ask questions, you know,
as long as they're well-behaved.

226
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,433
When she comes down,
don't say I've been here.

227
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,852
But she hasn't been here today.

228
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,396
I just saw her come in five minutes ago.

229
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,321
No, she hasn't been here at all.
I would have seen her.

230
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:58,945
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.

231
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:01,867
And there.

232
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:05,206
You see? Her key is on the rack.

233
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:08,626
- Would you please go up and look?
- To her room?

234
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:11,452
- That's right.
- Yes, of course, if you ask.

235
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,498
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.

236
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:35,101
Mr. Detective?

237
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:40,816
Would you like to come and look?

238
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,544
- Her car's gone.
- What car?

239
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:44,152
Midge...

240
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:48,620
...who do you know that's an authority
on San Francisco history?

241
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,243
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.

242
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,707
None of this:
"Hello, you look wonderful" stuff.

243
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:56,333
Just, "Do you know an authority
on San Francisco..."

244
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:58,581
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

245
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:01,498
Well, who do you? You know everybody.

246
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,425
Professor Saunders over in Berkeley.

247
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,512
No, I don't mean that kind of history.

248
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:10,511
I mean the small stuff,
people you never heard of.

249
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:16,302
You mean the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

250
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,773
Juicy stories, like who shot who
in the Embarcadero...

251
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:22,431
...in August, 1879.
- Yeah, that's right.

252
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,313
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?

253
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:27,399
Pop Leibel.
He owns the Argosy Book Shop.

254
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:29,442
What do you want to know?

255
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:33,577
I want to know who shot who
in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

256
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,329
Wait a minute. You're not
a detective anymore. What's going on?

257
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:40,573
- You know him well?
- Who?

258
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,660
- Pop Leibel.
- Sure.

259
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:45,577
Come on. I want you to introduce me.

260
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:48,464
- Get your hat.
- I don't need a hat.

261
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,173
Johnny, what's it all about?

262
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:59,049
Wait a minute.

263
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,222
Yes, I remember.

264
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:10,351
Carlotta.

265
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,023
The beautiful Carlotta.

266
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,609
The sad Carlotta.

267
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:19,028
What does an old house
on the corner of Eddy and Gough...

268
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:20,941
...have to do with Carlotta Valdés?

269
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:25,409
It was hers.
It was built for her many years ago.

270
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:27,409
- By whom?
- By...

271
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,793
No. The name I do not remember.

272
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,921
A rich man. A powerful man.

273
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:41,339
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

274
00:34:41,424 --> 00:34:43,381
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.

275
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:46,877
It is not an unusual story.

276
00:34:48,305 --> 00:34:51,839
She came from somewhere small,
to the south of the city.

277
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:56,299
Some say from a mission settlement.

278
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:59,178
Young, yes. Very young.

279
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:05,724
And she was found dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man...

280
00:35:06,777 --> 00:35:08,437
...and he took her...

281
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:13,483
...and built for her the great house
in the Western Addition.

282
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:16,446
And...

283
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,700
...there was a child.

284
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:23,455
Yes, that's it. The child. The child.

285
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:29,168
I cannot tell you
exactly how much time passed...

286
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,994
...or how much happiness there was...

287
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,629
...but then he threw her away.

288
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,883
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.

289
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,503
So, he kept the child and threw her away.

290
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:48,058
You know, a man could do that
in those days.

291
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:50,968
They had the power and the freedom.

292
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:54,975
And she became the sad Carlotta.

293
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,476
Alone in the great house...

294
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:01,109
...walking the streets alone...

295
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:05,698
...her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

296
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:11,111
And, the mad Carlotta...

297
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:15,414
...stopping people in the streets to ask:

298
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,160
"Where is my child?

299
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,334
"Have you seen my child?"

300
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:25,043
- Poor thing.
- And she died.

301
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:27,508
- She died.
- How?

302
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,384
By her own hand.

303
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:35,922
There are many such stories.

304
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:38,473
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

305
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:40,931
- I appreciate it. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

306
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:44,597
Wait a minute! Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.

307
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:54,858
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?

308
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:58,938
- For bringing you here. Come on, tell.
- There's nothing to tell.

309
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:03,031
- You'll tell or be back in that corset.
- Come on. I'll take you home.

310
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,123
There we are.

311
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:18,001
- You haven't told me everything.
- I've told you enough.

312
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:21,541
- Who's the guy and who's the wife?
- Out. I've got things to do.

313
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:25,169
I know. The one that phoned.
Your old college chum, Elster.

314
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,461
Midge, out, please.

315
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:30,137
The idea is the beautiful, mad Carlotta
has returned from the dead...

316
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:32,550
...and taken possession of Elster's wife.

317
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:35,512
Johnny, really. Come on.

318
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:38,808
I'm not telling you what I think,
I'm telling you what he thinks.

319
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:41,471
- What do you think?
- Well, I...

320
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:44,144
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?

321
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,770
Not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

322
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:53,065
Yes. I guess you'd consider
that she would be...

323
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:56,405
I think I'll go take a look
at that portrait. Good-bye.

324
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:58,869
- Midge...
- Good-bye!

325
00:38:29,814 --> 00:38:32,435
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.

326
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,434
- That's Carlotta Valdés.
- Yes.

327
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:37,017
There are things you didn't tell me.

328
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:40,855
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.

329
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:45,899
You notice the way she does her hair?
There's something else.

330
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:51,163
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces
of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.

331
00:38:51,249 --> 00:38:52,956
She inherited them.

332
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,788
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.

333
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,247
Until now.

334
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,628
Now when she's alone,
she takes them out and looks at them...

335
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,379
...handles them gently, curiously...

336
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,051
...puts them on and stares at herself
in the mirror...

337
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:13,004
...and then goes into that other world,
is someone else again.

338
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:17,722
Carlotta Valdés was what,
your wife's grandmother?

339
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:19,937
Great-grandmother.

340
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,513
The child who was taken from her...

341
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:27,184
...whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to
her death, was Madeleine's grandmother.

342
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:31,311
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdés home.

343
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,989
I think that explains it.

344
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:39,403
Anyone could become obsessed
with the past with a background like that.

345
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:42,702
She never heard of Carlotta Valdés.

346
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,201
She knows nothing of a grave out
at the Mission Dolores?

347
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:48,450
Or that old house on Eddy Street?

348
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:52,128
The portrait at
the Palace of the Legion of...

349
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:55,460
- Nothing.
- When she goes to these places...

350
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,506
She's no longer my wife.

351
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,929
How do you know
all these things she doesn't?

352
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:05,257
Her mother told me most of them
before she died.

353
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:07,265
I dug out the rest for myself here.

354
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:10,600
- Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
- Natural fear.

355
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:14,473
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

356
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:16,976
Her blood is in Madeleine.

357
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,446
Boy, I need this.

358
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:54,818
Madeleine.

359
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:57,612
Madeleine!

360
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:00,371
Yes?

361
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,414
No, it's all right.

362
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:07,081
Yeah, I'll call you back.

363
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:08,711
Yes.

364
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:14,585
You all right?

365
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:21,016
You'll want this.

366
00:45:56,547 --> 00:46:00,045
You'd better come over here
by the fire where it's warm.

367
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,755
What am I doing here?

368
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:09,675
What happened?

369
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:15,134
Well, you fell into San Francisco Bay.

370
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:20,848
And I tried to dry your hair as best I could.

371
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:24,642
Your things are in the kitchen.
They'll be dry in a few minutes.

372
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:27,020
Come on over by the fire.

373
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:37,361
I'll get you some cushions.

374
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:42,237
There you are.

375
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,795
Would you like to have some coffee?

376
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,961
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink?

377
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:05,643
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?

378
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,268
That's right.

379
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:11,187
- Thank you.
- You don't remember?

380
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,686
No, I...

381
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:18,150
Do you remember where you were?

382
00:47:20,447 --> 00:47:23,364
Yes. Of course I remember that.

383
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:29,528
But then I must have had a dizzy spell
and fainted.

384
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:31,246
Where were you?

385
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:35,449
At Old Fort Point. Out at the Presidio.

386
00:47:37,335 --> 00:47:39,908
Of course I remember. I often go there.

387
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,997
Why? Why do you go there?

388
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:45,882
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there.

389
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,801
Especially at sunset.

390
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:53,012
Thank you for the fire.

391
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:54,971
Where were you before?

392
00:47:55,433 --> 00:47:57,675
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.

393
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:01,145
Wandering about.

394
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:04,355
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?

395
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:09,269
Downtown, shopping.

396
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:14,020
Here, you'd better have some coffee.

397
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:16,107
I think it's still warm.

398
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:20,781
You're terribly direct in your questions.

399
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,408
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

400
00:48:24,832 --> 00:48:27,239
You're not. You're merely direct.

401
00:48:30,962 --> 00:48:34,128
And what were you doing there,
at Old Fort Point?

402
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,172
Just wandering about.

403
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:39,881
- You like it, too?
- Yes.

404
00:48:41,262 --> 00:48:43,468
And where had you been just before?

405
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:47,469
I'd been to the Palace of the Legion
of Honor, the art gallery.

406
00:48:48,183 --> 00:48:50,888
Yes, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?

407
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:55,095
I've never been inside,
but it looks so lovely driving past.

408
00:49:01,444 --> 00:49:04,279
It's lucky for me,
you were wandering about.

409
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:05,942
Thank you.

410
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,982
I've been a terrible bother to you.

411
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:09,699
No, you haven't.

412
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:14,538
When you...

413
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,034
There were some pins in my hair.

414
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:24,127
The pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get 'em for you.

415
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:26,004
And my purse, please.

416
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,293
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

417
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,796
You shouldn't have brought me here.

418
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,055
I didn't know where you lived.

419
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:46,307
You could have looked in my car.
But you didn't know my car, did you?

420
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:49,357
I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

421
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:52,643
But I didn't think you wanted
to be taken home that way.

422
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:54,188
No, you're right.

423
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:57,728
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.

424
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:02,356
Thank you. But I don't know you
and you don't know me.

425
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:06,029
- My name is Madeleine Elster.
- My name's John Ferguson.

426
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:09,987
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?

427
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,333
John, mostly.

428
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:15,787
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.

429
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,372
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.

430
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:20,789
Gee whiz, I wouldn't like that.

431
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:25,757
After what happened this afternoon,
I should think you'd call me Scottie.

432
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:27,422
Maybe even John.

433
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,424
I prefer John.

434
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:35,971
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

435
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:39,230
I wander about.

436
00:50:39,314 --> 00:50:42,563
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?

437
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,527
- One shouldn't live alone.
- Some people prefer it.

438
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:51,233
No, it's wrong.

439
00:50:54,535 --> 00:50:56,112
I'm married, you know.

440
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:04,661
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?

441
00:51:05,585 --> 00:51:06,617
What?

442
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:09,666
Falling into San Francisco Bay.

443
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,837
No, it's never happened before.

444
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:19,168
I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats,
when I was a little girl.

445
00:51:19,596 --> 00:51:24,057
I even fell into the river once
trying to leap from one stone to another.

446
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:27,429
But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay.

447
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,478
Have you ever before?

448
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:33,268
No, it's the first time for me, too.

449
00:51:35,943 --> 00:51:38,149
I'll get you some more coffee.

450
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:55,666
<i>- Hello?
- What happened? She's not home yet.</i>

451
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,499
She's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.

452
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:02,494
<i>- What happened?
- She went into the Bay.</i>

453
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:07,880
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Did she hurt herself?</i>

454
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:10,673
No, she'll be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

455
00:52:10,763 --> 00:52:13,336
But she doesn't know. Do you understand?

456
00:52:13,556 --> 00:52:15,845
She doesn't know what happened.

457
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:21,267
<i>Scottie, Madeleine is 26.</i>

458
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:25,600
<i>Carlotta Valdés committed suicide
when she was 26.</i>

459
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:29,267
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

460
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,796
Well now, Johnny-O. Was it a ghost?

461
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,345
Was it fun?

462
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:35,501
That letter for me?

463
00:55:41,223 --> 00:55:42,965
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:47,680
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.

465
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,302
Well, I suddenly felt such a fool.

466
00:55:50,396 --> 00:55:52,721
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

467
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:55,388
Yes, I'm fine. No aftereffects.

468
00:55:57,485 --> 00:55:59,810
As I remember now,
the water was cold, wasn't it?

469
00:55:59,904 --> 00:56:03,070
- It sure was.
- What a terrible thing for me to do.

470
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:05,281
You were so kind.

471
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,076
It's a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

472
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:13,157
- You've nothing to apologize for.
- Yes, I do.

473
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:15,952
The whole thing must have been
so embarrassing for you.

474
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,998
Not at all. I enjoyed...

475
00:56:19,879 --> 00:56:21,372
...talking to you.

476
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,665
I enjoyed talking to you.

477
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,463
I'll get my mail.

478
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,430
- Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

479
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:43,053
I couldn't mail it. I didn't know
your address, but I had a landmark.

480
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:45,934
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

481
00:56:46,024 --> 00:56:49,227
That's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

482
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:55,735
- I hope we will too.
- What?

483
00:56:56,491 --> 00:56:58,732
- Meet again sometime.
- We have.

484
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:03,525
Good-bye.

485
00:57:19,676 --> 00:57:21,466
Where are you going?

486
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:23,125
I don't know.

487
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,714
- Shopping?
- No.

488
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,089
Anywhere in particular?

489
00:57:28,475 --> 00:57:30,633
I just thought that I'd wander.

490
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:33,927
That's what I was going to do.

491
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,226
That's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?

492
00:57:39,525 --> 00:57:42,194
Don't you think it's a waste
for the two of us...

493
00:57:42,277 --> 00:57:44,068
To wander separately?

494
00:57:44,613 --> 00:57:46,651
But only one is a wanderer.

495
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:49,111
Two together are always
going somewhere.

496
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,820
I don't think that's necessarily true.

497
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:55,945
- You left your door open.
- Be right back.

498
00:58:39,823 --> 00:58:40,938
How old?

499
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:43,404
Some 2,000 years or more.

500
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:46,573
- The oldest living things.
- Yes.

501
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:50,362
- You've never been here before?
- No.

502
00:58:50,957 --> 00:58:52,617
What are you thinking?

503
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:55,824
Of all the people who've been born
and have died...

504
00:58:55,919 --> 00:58:57,663
...while the trees went on living.

505
00:58:57,755 --> 00:59:01,965
<i>Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living."</i>

506
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:04,590
- I don't like them.
- Why?

507
00:59:05,552 --> 00:59:07,130
Knowing I have to die.

508
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,981
Here's a cross section of one
of the old trees that's been cut down.

509
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,380
Somewhere in here I was born...

510
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,505
...and there I died.

511
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,761
It was only a moment for you.

512
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,265
You took no notice.

513
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:16,854
Madeleine.

514
01:01:04,856 --> 01:01:07,061
Madeleine, where are you now?

515
01:01:08,192 --> 01:01:10,065
- Here with you.
- Where?

516
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:14,278
- The tall trees...
- Have you been here before?

517
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:16,031
- Yes.
- When?

518
01:01:18,116 --> 01:01:19,824
When were you born?

519
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,284
- Long ago.
- Where?

520
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,786
When? Tell me.

521
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:26,824
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!

522
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:30,034
- Where do you go? What takes you away?
- I can't tell you.

523
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:33,080
When you jumped into the Bay,
you didn't know where you were.

524
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,337
- I didn't jump. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?

525
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:40,171
- I can't tell you.
- What was inside that told you to jump?

526
01:01:40,634 --> 01:01:42,093
- Please.
- What?

527
01:01:42,302 --> 01:01:44,093
Please, don't ask me.

528
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:47,839
Take me away from here.

529
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:50,515
Shall I take you home?

530
01:01:52,436 --> 01:01:54,345
Somewhere in the light.

531
01:01:55,021 --> 01:01:58,472
Promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.

532
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:34,795
Why did you run?

533
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,295
I'm responsible for you now.

534
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:40,723
The Chinese say
that once you've saved a person's life...

535
01:02:40,807 --> 01:02:44,057
...you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.

536
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:45,894
I have to know.

537
01:02:47,021 --> 01:02:49,262
There's so little that I know.

538
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:57,861
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor...

539
01:02:59,782 --> 01:03:04,193
...that once was mirrored, and fragments
of that mirror still hang there...

540
01:03:04,577 --> 01:03:07,909
...and when I come to the end
of the corridor...

541
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:10,369
...there's nothing but darkness.

542
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:14,876
And I know that
when I walk into the darkness...

543
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:18,830
...that I'll die.

544
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:24,706
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.

545
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,967
- Except once.
- Yesterday?

546
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:32,843
And you didn't know what happened
till you found yourself with me.

547
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:34,765
You didn't know where you were.

548
01:03:34,851 --> 01:03:38,598
But the small scenes, the fragments
of the mirror, you remember those.

549
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:40,644
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?

550
01:03:40,731 --> 01:03:42,687
There's a room...

551
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:45,314
...and I sit there alone.

552
01:03:45,568 --> 01:03:47,690
- Always alone.
- What else?

553
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:50,610
- A grave.
- Where?

554
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:55,446
I don't know. It's an open grave and...

555
01:03:56,907 --> 01:03:59,943
...I stand by the gravestone
looking down into it.

556
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:02,652
- It's my grave.
- How do you know?

557
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:06,445
- I know.
- But is there a name on the gravestone?

558
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,286
No.

559
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:12,582
No, it's new and clean and waiting.

560
01:04:14,379 --> 01:04:15,707
What else?

561
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:18,503
This part is a dream, I think.

562
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:24,754
There's a tower and a bell,
and a garden below.

563
01:04:25,722 --> 01:04:27,761
It seems to be in Spain...

564
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,175
...a village in Spain.

565
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:33,098
It clicks off and it's gone.

566
01:04:33,186 --> 01:04:35,059
Well, a portrait?

567
01:04:35,688 --> 01:04:37,764
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.

568
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,893
If I could just find the key, the beginning...

569
01:04:41,192 --> 01:04:42,935
...and put it together, I...

570
01:04:43,027 --> 01:04:44,900
And so explain it away?

571
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:48,894
There is a way to explain it, you see.

572
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,533
If I'm mad, then that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

573
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:57,449
Madeleine!

574
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,204
Scottie!

575
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,210
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.

576
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:11,291
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.

577
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:13,375
Scottie, don't let me go.

578
01:05:13,885 --> 01:05:16,423
I'm here. I've got you.

579
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:18,798
I'm so afraid.

580
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:30,516
Don't leave me.

581
01:05:31,191 --> 01:05:33,313
- Stay with me.
- All the time.

582
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,167
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi.

583
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:06,212
- Did you get my message?
- I did, indeed.

584
01:06:07,303 --> 01:06:09,094
I'll get you a drink.

585
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:10,383
Okay.

586
01:06:10,806 --> 01:06:14,424
Since when do you go around
slipping notes under men's doors?

587
01:06:14,768 --> 01:06:17,388
Since I stopped being able to get them
on the phone.

588
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:21,178
For a man who has nothing to do,
you're certainly a busy little bee.

589
01:06:21,272 --> 01:06:23,099
Where do you go these days?

590
01:06:23,607 --> 01:06:24,888
Just wandering.

591
01:06:26,527 --> 01:06:28,519
- Where?
- Round about.

592
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,607
What was this desperate urge to see me?

593
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,702
All I said in my note was:
"Where are you?"

594
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:42,361
Doesn't sound very desperate to me.

595
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,988
I detected a little undercurrent.

596
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:50,076
I just thought that if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner...

597
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:52,708
...you'd be so grateful
you'd take me to a movie.

598
01:06:52,797 --> 01:06:56,166
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?

599
01:06:57,968 --> 01:06:59,296
This and that.

600
01:07:00,053 --> 01:07:01,879
What I've been doing?

601
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:04,056
If you want to.

602
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:06,933
We won't talk about anything
you don't want to.

603
01:07:07,142 --> 01:07:08,471
Naturally.

604
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,513
What have you been doing?

605
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:15,936
Wandering.

606
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:21,397
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

607
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,979
I've been having a wonderful time.

608
01:07:24,114 --> 01:07:27,779
- I've gone back to my first love: painting.
- Good for you.

609
01:07:27,992 --> 01:07:31,408
I always said you were wasting your time
in the underwear department.

610
01:07:31,495 --> 01:07:34,911
It's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.

611
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:37,115
What is it? A still life?

612
01:07:37,584 --> 01:07:39,706
No, not exactly.

613
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:42,419
You want to see?

614
01:07:43,713 --> 01:07:46,120
I thought I might give it to you.

615
01:08:01,435 --> 01:08:03,309
It's not funny, Midge.

616
01:08:06,606 --> 01:08:08,266
I just thought...

617
01:08:12,194 --> 01:08:14,602
Let's make that movie some other night.

618
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:30,205
Marjorie Wood, you fool!

619
01:08:31,459 --> 01:08:32,622
Idiot!

620
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,093
Stupid! Stupid!

621
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:24,417
Madeleine! What's the matter?

622
01:09:24,502 --> 01:09:28,085
I should have phoned,
but I wanted to see you, be with you.

623
01:09:28,213 --> 01:09:30,918
- Why? What's happened?
- I had the dream.

624
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:34,417
- The dream came back again.
- It's gonna be all right.

625
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,261
It'll be all right. I'll get you some brandy.

626
01:09:38,847 --> 01:09:40,471
Drink this down.

627
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:42,842
Just like medicine.

628
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,013
There now.

629
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:49,769
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.

630
01:09:51,316 --> 01:09:52,939
Now, can you tell me?

631
01:09:54,193 --> 01:09:58,060
It was the tower again,
and the bell and the old Spanish village.

632
01:09:58,154 --> 01:10:01,238
- Yes?
- Clear, so very clear for the first time.

633
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:02,736
Tell me.

634
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:06,197
It was a village square
and a green with trees...

635
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,369
...and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.

636
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:12,956
Across the green,
there was a big, gray wooden house...

637
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:16,041
...with a porch and a balcony
above a small garden...

638
01:10:16,127 --> 01:10:19,827
...and next to it a livery stable
with old carriages lined up inside.

639
01:10:19,922 --> 01:10:21,084
Go on.

640
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:24,540
At the end of the green,
there was a whitewashed stone house...

641
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:26,791
...with a lovely pepper tree at the corner.

642
01:10:26,885 --> 01:10:29,969
And an old wooden hotel
from the old California days?

643
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:34,598
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings,
with hanging oil lamps?

644
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:37,800
- Yes.
- It's all there.

645
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:40,306
It's no dream.

646
01:10:42,523 --> 01:10:45,274
You've been there before. You've seen it.

647
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:48,147
No, never.

648
01:10:48,236 --> 01:10:52,067
A hundred miles south of San Francisco,
there's an old Spanish mission...

649
01:10:52,156 --> 01:10:55,026
...San Juan Bautista it's called
and it's been preserved...

650
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,820
...exactly as it was 100 years ago
as a museum.

651
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:00,531
Think hard, darling. Think hard.

652
01:11:01,455 --> 01:11:05,118
- You've been there before. You've seen it.
- I've never been there.

653
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,663
- What is it? I've never been there.
- Think hard.

654
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:10,372
Go on about your dream.
What frightened you?

655
01:11:10,796 --> 01:11:13,879
I stood alone on the green
searching for something...

656
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:17,460
...and then I started to walk to the church...

657
01:11:18,635 --> 01:11:22,502
...but then the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark...

658
01:11:23,097 --> 01:11:27,308
...being pulled into the darkness,
and I fought to wake up.

659
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,931
You're going to be all right now.

660
01:11:31,187 --> 01:11:33,642
You've given me
something to work on now.

661
01:11:33,731 --> 01:11:36,019
I'll take you to that mission this afternoon.

662
01:11:36,107 --> 01:11:38,812
When you see it,
you'll remember when you saw it before.

663
01:11:38,902 --> 01:11:42,104
It'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it, I promise you.

664
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:44,232
All right?

665
01:11:46,365 --> 01:11:50,065
- Come on, now. I'll take you home.
- No. I'll be all right.

666
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:53,284
You'll come back here around noon.

667
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:15,558
Madeleine, where are you now?

668
01:13:17,688 --> 01:13:20,143
- Here with you.
- And it's all real!

669
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:22,938
It's not merely as it was 100 years ago...

670
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:27,403
...or a year ago or six months ago or
whenever it was you were here to see it.

671
01:13:27,488 --> 01:13:30,358
Now, Madeleine,
think of when you were here.

672
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:35,196
There were not so many carriages then.

673
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,152
There were horses in the stalls...

674
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,531
...a bay, two black and a gray.

675
01:13:44,794 --> 01:13:46,916
It was our favorite place...

676
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:51,162
...but we were forbidden to play here.

677
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:54,756
And Sister Teresa would scold us.

678
01:13:59,013 --> 01:14:01,848
Look at this. Here's your gray horse.

679
01:14:04,017 --> 01:14:08,228
Have a little trouble getting in and out
of the stall without being pushed.

680
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:11,147
You see? There's an answer
for everything.

681
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:18,065
Madeleine, try.

682
01:14:23,533 --> 01:14:24,907
Try for me.

683
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:48,218
- I love you, Madeleine.
- I love you, too.

684
01:14:48,636 --> 01:14:51,340
- Too late. Too late.
- No. We're together.

685
01:14:51,514 --> 01:14:54,348
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.

686
01:14:54,474 --> 01:14:56,799
No. There's nothing you must do.

687
01:14:57,435 --> 01:14:59,593
There's nothing you must do.

688
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:04,600
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

689
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,938
No. It's too late.

690
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,490
It's not fair. It's too late.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

691
01:15:29,586 --> 01:15:32,254
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's what counts.

692
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:34,663
- Please let me go!
- Listen to me.

693
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:43,342
- You believe I love you?
- Yes.

694
01:15:45,265 --> 01:15:47,470
And if you lose me, then you'll know...

695
01:15:47,558 --> 01:15:50,227
...I loved you and wanted
to go on loving you.

696
01:15:50,477 --> 01:15:51,935
I won't lose you.

697
01:15:54,564 --> 01:15:57,481
- Let me go into the church, alone.
- But why?

698
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:20,907
Madeleine!

699
01:18:44,741 --> 01:18:49,865
Mr. Elster, suspecting all was not well
with his wife's mental state...

700
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:55,158
...took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson...

701
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,242
...lest any harm befall her.

702
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:59,951
And you've heard
that Mr. Elster was prepared...

703
01:19:00,046 --> 01:19:02,536
...to take his wife to an institution...

704
01:19:02,673 --> 01:19:07,133
...where her mental health would've been
in the hands of qualified specialists.

705
01:19:07,927 --> 01:19:11,461
Mr. Ferguson, being an ex-detective,
would have seemed...

706
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:15,047
...the proper choice for the role
of watchdog and protector.

707
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:18,350
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

708
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:22,267
However, I think you'll agree that no blame
can be attached to the husband.

709
01:19:22,354 --> 01:19:24,927
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care...

710
01:19:25,024 --> 01:19:28,807
...was due only to the need
for information as to her behavior...

711
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:31,516
...which he expected to get
from Mr. Ferguson.

712
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:34,316
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife.

713
01:19:34,406 --> 01:19:37,442
He could not have anticipated
that Mr. Ferguson's weakness...

714
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:39,277
...his fear of heights...

715
01:19:39,493 --> 01:19:42,328
...would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

716
01:19:42,412 --> 01:19:44,204
As to Mr. Ferguson...

717
01:19:45,123 --> 01:19:47,614
...you have heard his former superior...

718
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:51,534
...Detective Captain Hansen,
from that great city to the north...

719
01:19:51,629 --> 01:19:54,415
...testify as to his character and ability.

720
01:19:54,672 --> 01:19:57,080
Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic.

721
01:19:57,341 --> 01:20:00,377
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances...

722
01:20:00,469 --> 01:20:04,880
...Mr. Ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death...

723
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:08,388
...Captain Hansen dismissed
as an "unfortunate incident."

724
01:20:10,393 --> 01:20:12,884
Of course, Mr. Ferguson
is to be congratulated...

725
01:20:12,978 --> 01:20:15,551
...on having once saved the woman's life...

726
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:20,149
...when, in a previous fit of aberration,
she threw herself into the Bay.

727
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:24,436
It is a pity that,
knowing her suicidal tendencies...

728
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:28,358
...he did not make a greater effort
the second time.

729
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:35,281
But we are not here to pass judgment
on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.

730
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:37,080
He did nothing...

731
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:41,115
...and the law has little to say
on the subject of things left undone.

732
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:46,369
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall...

733
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,711
...have any bearing on your verdict.

734
01:20:50,509 --> 01:20:53,959
He did not remain at the scene
of the death. He left.

735
01:20:54,679 --> 01:20:58,261
He claims he suffered a mental blackout
and knew nothing more...

736
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:03,056
...until he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco hours later.

737
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:05,683
You may accept that, or not.

738
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:11,478
Or you may believe that, having once again
allowed someone to die...

739
01:21:12,193 --> 01:21:15,608
...he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness...

740
01:21:15,696 --> 01:21:17,189
...and ran away.

741
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,360
That has nothing to do with your verdict.

742
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:26,029
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

743
01:21:28,038 --> 01:21:32,616
From the evidence of the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her death...

744
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:36,576
...from the manner of her death and
the postmortem examination of the body...

745
01:21:36,671 --> 01:21:38,709
...showing the actual cause of her death...

746
01:21:38,797 --> 01:21:41,667
...you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict.

747
01:21:41,758 --> 01:21:44,213
Gentlemen, you may retire if you wish.

748
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:48,929
Hold it, Mr. Jones.

749
01:22:10,823 --> 01:22:13,361
- We've reached a verdict.
- Thank you.

750
01:22:16,786 --> 01:22:19,905
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide...

751
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:21,954
"...while of unsound mind."

752
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:25,749
Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.

753
01:22:32,007 --> 01:22:34,960
- Scottie, let's go.
- Mind if I speak to him for a minute?

754
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,296
Go ahead.

755
01:22:42,932 --> 01:22:45,220
Sorry, Scottie. That was rough.

756
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:48,091
He had no right to speak to you like that.

757
01:22:48,186 --> 01:22:51,934
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.

758
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:55,101
No, there's nothing you have to say to me.

759
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:57,932
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.

760
01:22:58,069 --> 01:22:59,729
I can't stay here.

761
01:23:00,237 --> 01:23:03,191
I'm going to wind up her affairs,
and mine...

762
01:23:03,699 --> 01:23:05,690
...get away as far as I can.

763
01:23:06,451 --> 01:23:08,075
Europe, perhaps.

764
01:23:08,786 --> 01:23:11,323
And I probably never will come back.

765
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:13,949
Good-bye, Scottie.

766
01:23:15,542 --> 01:23:18,707
If there's anything I can do for you
before I go...

767
01:23:20,421 --> 01:23:22,792
There's no way for them to understand.

768
01:23:24,007 --> 01:23:26,544
You and I know who killed Madeleine.

769
01:23:34,265 --> 01:23:36,387
Come on, Scottie. Let's get out of here.

770
01:25:44,702 --> 01:25:48,070
It's Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus.

771
01:25:49,706 --> 01:25:52,826
I had a long talk with that lady
in Musical Therapy...

772
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,573
...and she says
that Mozart's the boy for you...

773
01:25:55,669 --> 01:25:58,290
...the broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

774
01:26:00,798 --> 01:26:02,755
It's what the lady said.

775
01:26:06,136 --> 01:26:09,255
It's wonderful how
they have it all taped now, John.

776
01:26:09,346 --> 01:26:13,759
They have music for dipsomaniacs,
and music for melancholiacs...

777
01:26:13,892 --> 01:26:16,098
...and music for hypochondriacs.

778
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:20,720
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files mixed up.

779
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,780
I brought a lot of other things,
and you can see what you like.

780
01:26:35,117 --> 01:26:37,193
It shuts off automatically.

781
01:26:45,626 --> 01:26:47,368
Johnny, please try.

782
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,330
Try, Johnny.

783
01:26:49,796 --> 01:26:52,547
You're not lost. Mother is here.

784
01:26:57,219 --> 01:26:58,298
Time?

785
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:04,096
I'll be in again, John.

786
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:07,013
You want me to shut that off?

787
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,526
You don't even know I'm here, do you?

788
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:37,750
But I'm here.

789
01:27:52,596 --> 01:27:54,921
Nurse, could I see the doctor
for a moment?

790
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:57,759
Doctor, Miss Wood.

791
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,552
Won't you go in, please?

792
01:28:02,396 --> 01:28:03,938
Yes, Miss Wood?

793
01:28:04,314 --> 01:28:08,228
Doctor, how long is it going to take you
to pull him out of this?

794
01:28:08,442 --> 01:28:11,608
It's hard to say. At least six months.
Perhaps a year.

795
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:13,735
It really could depend on him.

796
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,897
- He won't talk.
- No.

797
01:28:16,616 --> 01:28:19,236
He's suffering from acute melancholia...

798
01:28:19,326 --> 01:28:21,283
...together with a guilt complex.

799
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:23,824
He blames himself
for what happened to the woman.

800
01:28:23,913 --> 01:28:26,534
We know little of what went on before.

801
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:30,368
I can give you one thing:
He was in love with her.

802
01:28:31,377 --> 01:28:33,998
That does complicate the problem,
doesn't it?

803
01:28:34,588 --> 01:28:37,754
I can give you another complication:
He still is.

804
01:28:38,758 --> 01:28:40,418
And you want to know something?

805
01:28:40,509 --> 01:28:43,463
I don't think Mozart's going to help at all.

806
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:16,626
- Where'd you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?

807
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:20,039
I bought it from a man who used to live
in this building.

808
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:23,416
Mr. Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him when he moved away.

809
01:30:24,342 --> 01:30:26,382
You knew him and his wife!

810
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:28,551
The poor thing. I didn't know her.

811
01:30:28,638 --> 01:30:31,804
- Is it true that she really...
- I'm sorry.

812
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,739
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

813
01:31:21,889 --> 01:31:23,631
Give me a scotch and soda.

814
01:34:02,808 --> 01:34:06,473
- What is it?
- Could I ask you a couple of questions?

815
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:09,771
- What for? Who are you?
- My name is John Ferguson.

816
01:34:09,981 --> 01:34:12,103
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll?

817
01:34:13,025 --> 01:34:15,942
- There are some things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?

818
01:34:16,027 --> 01:34:18,648
No. I happened to see you
when you came in, so I...

819
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:20,731
Yeah, I thought so. A pickup.

820
01:34:20,948 --> 01:34:24,696
You've got a nerve, following me
into the hotel and up to my room.

821
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:28,533
- Now, you beat it.
- Please. I just want to talk to you.

822
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,531
I'm gonna yell in a minute.

823
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:33,457
I'm not gonna hurt you. Honest.
I promise.

824
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:36,579
Please. Just let me talk to you.

825
01:34:37,462 --> 01:34:39,120
- What about?
- You.

826
01:34:39,504 --> 01:34:42,256
- Why?
- Because you remind me of somebody.

827
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:45,834
I heard that one before, too.

828
01:34:46,593 --> 01:34:49,262
I remind you of someone
you were madly in love with...

829
01:34:49,346 --> 01:34:51,468
...but then she ditched you
for another guy...

830
01:34:51,556 --> 01:34:54,307
...and you've been carrying a torch
ever since.

831
01:34:54,433 --> 01:34:57,054
Then you saw me and something clicked.

832
01:34:58,561 --> 01:35:00,221
You're not far wrong.

833
01:35:00,313 --> 01:35:03,681
- It's not gonna work, so go.
- Please, let me come in.

834
01:35:04,859 --> 01:35:09,151
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.

835
01:35:11,864 --> 01:35:14,533
Well, I warn you, I can yell awful loud.

836
01:35:14,783 --> 01:35:16,443
You won't have to.

837
01:35:17,702 --> 01:35:23,157
You don't look much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?

838
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:25,449
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.

839
01:35:25,541 --> 01:35:27,997
- Who you are.
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.

840
01:35:28,086 --> 01:35:32,129
- How do you happen to be living here?
- It's a place to live, that's all.

841
01:35:32,296 --> 01:35:35,381
- But you haven't lived here long?
- Yeah, about three years.

842
01:35:35,466 --> 01:35:38,170
- Where did you live before?
- Salina, Kansas!

843
01:35:39,803 --> 01:35:42,293
Listen, what is this? What do you want?

844
01:35:42,930 --> 01:35:46,050
- I just want to know who you are.
- Well, I told you.

845
01:35:48,184 --> 01:35:51,221
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.

846
01:35:51,437 --> 01:35:53,595
I work at Magnin's and I live here.

847
01:35:55,982 --> 01:35:58,059
My gosh, do I have to prove it?

848
01:36:03,739 --> 01:36:06,739
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.

849
01:36:07,367 --> 01:36:10,699
"Judy Barton, number Z296794.

850
01:36:10,828 --> 01:36:13,994
"425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas."

851
01:36:17,583 --> 01:36:21,117
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.

852
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:25,536
A California license issued May 25, 1954.

853
01:36:27,341 --> 01:36:30,424
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?

854
01:36:32,178 --> 01:36:35,629
Whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

855
01:36:40,017 --> 01:36:42,638
You have got it bad, haven't you?

856
01:36:45,397 --> 01:36:47,436
Do I really look like her?

857
01:36:52,444 --> 01:36:54,567
She's dead, isn't she?

858
01:36:59,242 --> 01:37:02,408
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry I yelled at you.

859
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:11,907
Yes, that's me with my mother.

860
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:15,039
And that's my father.

861
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:19,664
He's dead. My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy...

862
01:37:19,758 --> 01:37:23,292
...so I decided I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

863
01:37:24,387 --> 01:37:26,462
I've been here three years.

864
01:37:27,055 --> 01:37:28,253
Honest.

865
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:40,768
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Why?

866
01:37:41,525 --> 01:37:45,357
- I feel I owe you something after all this.
- You don't owe me anything.

867
01:37:45,445 --> 01:37:48,445
- Then will you? For me?
- Dinner and what else?

868
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:52,773
- Just dinner.
- 'Cause I remind you of her?

869
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,696
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.

870
01:38:00,415 --> 01:38:02,490
I've been on blind dates before.

871
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:06,077
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.

872
01:38:07,838 --> 01:38:08,751
Okay.

873
01:38:09,047 --> 01:38:11,752
I'll get my car. I'll be back in half an hour.

874
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:15,090
- Give me time to change and get fixed up.
- An hour?

875
01:38:16,678 --> 01:38:17,709
Okay.

876
01:40:12,395 --> 01:40:13,973
<i>Dearest Scottie:</i>

877
01:40:14,773 --> 01:40:16,515
<i>And so you found me.</i>

878
01:40:16,983 --> 01:40:19,652
<i>This is the moment
that I dreaded and hoped for...</i>

879
01:40:19,734 --> 01:40:23,234
<i>...wondering what I would say and do
if I ever saw you again.</i>

880
01:40:23,654 --> 01:40:26,323
<i>I wanted so to see you again, just once.</i>

881
01:40:26,699 --> 01:40:29,403
<i>Now I'll go,
and you can give up your search.</i>

882
01:40:29,742 --> 01:40:34,071
<i>I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself for.</i>

883
01:40:34,205 --> 01:40:35,747
<i>You were the victim.</i>

884
01:40:35,832 --> 01:40:40,456
<i>I was the tool and you the victim
of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.</i>

885
01:40:40,793 --> 01:40:45,288
<i>He chose me to play the part because
I looked like her. He dressed me like her.</i>

886
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:49,585
<i>He was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to town.</i>

887
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:52,546
<i>He chose you to be the witness
to a suicide.</i>

888
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:56,174
<i>The Carlotta story was part real,
part invented...</i>

889
01:40:56,264 --> 01:40:59,762
<i>...to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.</i>

890
01:41:00,392 --> 01:41:04,721
<i>He knew of your illness. He knew
you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.</i>

891
01:41:05,063 --> 01:41:07,897
<i>He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.</i>

892
01:41:09,233 --> 01:41:11,723
<i>I made the mistake. I fell in love.</i>

893
01:41:12,276 --> 01:41:14,483
<i>That wasn't part of the plan.</i>

894
01:41:15,363 --> 01:41:18,981
<i>I'm still in love with you,
and I want you so to love me.</i>

895
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,982
<i>If I had the nerve, I'd stay and lie...</i>

896
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,531
<i>...hoping that I could
make you love me again...</i>

897
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,446
<i>...as I am, for myself...</i>

898
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:31,199
<i>...and so forget the other
and forget the past. But...</i>

899
01:41:32,877 --> 01:41:35,877
<i>...I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.</i>

900
01:43:52,322 --> 01:43:54,029
Here. I'll do it.

901
01:43:55,866 --> 01:43:58,949
- There you are.
- Thanks again. Good night.

902
01:43:59,077 --> 01:44:00,950
Can I see you tomorrow?

903
01:44:01,662 --> 01:44:05,113
- Tomorrow night? Well...
- No, I mean tomorrow morning.

904
01:44:08,084 --> 01:44:10,409
But I have to go to work. I've got a job.

905
01:44:10,502 --> 01:44:14,500
- Don't go to your job.
- What'll I live on? My oil wells in Texas?

906
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,045
Let me take care of you, Judy.

907
01:44:18,926 --> 01:44:21,298
Thanks very much, but no, thanks.

908
01:44:22,596 --> 01:44:25,928
- No, Judy, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

909
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:28,761
I've been understanding since I was 17.

910
01:44:29,517 --> 01:44:31,309
- And the next step is?
- No.

911
01:44:32,103 --> 01:44:34,179
No? Then what?

912
01:44:34,646 --> 01:44:36,271
We could just...

913
01:44:36,774 --> 01:44:38,813
...see a lot of each other...

914
01:44:39,609 --> 01:44:40,640
Why?

915
01:44:41,987 --> 01:44:43,943
'Cause I remind you of her?

916
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:51,573
It's not very complimentary.

917
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:54,953
And nothing else?

918
01:44:57,082 --> 01:44:58,077
No.

919
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,865
That's not very complimentary either.

920
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,830
I just want to be with you
as much as I can.

921
01:45:16,681 --> 01:45:17,878
Well...

922
01:45:18,891 --> 01:45:22,591
...I guess I could phone the store
in the morning...

923
01:45:24,562 --> 01:45:26,518
...and make some excuse.

924
01:46:33,117 --> 01:46:34,610
There you are.

925
01:46:36,328 --> 01:46:37,952
I like that one.

926
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:39,954
- Like that?
- Yes.

927
01:46:40,664 --> 01:46:43,072
- That's very nice.
- It's beautiful.

928
01:46:44,959 --> 01:46:46,418
There we are.

929
01:46:46,502 --> 01:46:49,456
We'll get this,
then we'll buy you those clothes.

930
01:46:49,547 --> 01:46:51,704
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.

931
01:46:51,798 --> 01:46:54,882
- Nothing but the best. How much?
- That'll be 50 cents.

932
01:46:54,967 --> 01:46:56,924
- Thank you.
- You don't have to.

933
01:46:57,011 --> 01:46:58,339
I want to.

934
01:47:21,322 --> 01:47:25,105
- No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
- But you said gray, sir.

935
01:47:25,367 --> 01:47:28,201
I just want an ordinary, simple gray suit.

936
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:31,951
- But I like that one, Scottie.
- No, it's not right.

937
01:47:32,914 --> 01:47:35,749
The gentleman seems to know
what he wants.

938
01:47:36,542 --> 01:47:38,535
All right. We'll find it.

939
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:49,050
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to buy you a suit.

940
01:47:50,303 --> 01:47:52,794
But I love the second one she wore.

941
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:57,256
- And this one, it's beautiful.
- They're none of them right.

942
01:47:57,768 --> 01:48:01,183
I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.

943
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:03,595
Let me see. We may still have that model.

944
01:48:03,689 --> 01:48:05,018
Thank you.

945
01:48:07,192 --> 01:48:09,943
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.

946
01:48:10,027 --> 01:48:13,193
- You want me to dress like her.
- I just want you to look nice.

947
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,862
- I know what suit would look well on you.
- No, I won't do it!

948
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:21,408
Judy.

949
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:25,700
It can't make a difference to you.
I just want to see...

950
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:28,992
I don't want any clothes.
I want to get out of here.

951
01:48:29,126 --> 01:48:31,533
- Do this for me.
- Here we are.

952
01:48:32,545 --> 01:48:34,538
- Yes, that's it.
- I thought so.

953
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,627
- I don't like it.
- We'll take it.

954
01:48:37,966 --> 01:48:39,212
Will the thing fit?

955
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:42,799
It might need some slight alterations,
but it's madam's size.

956
01:48:43,804 --> 01:48:46,425
We'll have it for you to try on in a moment.

957
01:48:46,557 --> 01:48:49,511
- How long will the alterations take?
- Well...

958
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,969
- May we have it by tonight?
- If it's absolutely necessary.

959
01:48:53,103 --> 01:48:56,519
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look
at a dinner dress...

960
01:48:56,648 --> 01:49:00,810
...short, black, with long sleeves
and a kind of square neck.

961
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:02,941
- Scottie!
- My!

962
01:49:03,778 --> 01:49:07,443
You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.

963
01:49:15,746 --> 01:49:18,865
- That's it. Do you have them in brown?
- Yes, we have.

964
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:20,037
Fine.

965
01:49:28,174 --> 01:49:31,755
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

966
01:49:32,594 --> 01:49:36,092
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

967
01:49:36,304 --> 01:49:37,763
I don't know.

968
01:49:38,223 --> 01:49:40,511
No good, I guess. I don't know.

969
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:47,353
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

970
01:49:48,732 --> 01:49:50,391
You can, you know.

971
01:49:52,692 --> 01:49:54,732
No. You wouldn't let me.

972
01:49:57,196 --> 01:49:59,948
And I don't want to go.

973
01:50:01,074 --> 01:50:03,612
Judy, I tell you this.

974
01:50:03,785 --> 01:50:07,367
These past few days are
the first happy days I've had in a year.

975
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:09,663
I know because...

976
01:50:10,916 --> 01:50:13,038
Because I remind you of her.

977
01:50:14,878 --> 01:50:17,035
And not even that very much.

978
01:50:17,379 --> 01:50:18,411
No.

979
01:50:19,298 --> 01:50:22,416
No, Judy. It's you, too.

980
01:50:23,217 --> 01:50:25,542
There's something in you that...

981
01:50:30,097 --> 01:50:33,098
- You don't even want to touch me.
- Yes, I do.

982
01:50:35,477 --> 01:50:38,810
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?

983
01:50:40,397 --> 01:50:44,062
When we first started out, it was so good.
We had fun.

984
01:50:46,527 --> 01:50:49,232
And then you started in on the clothes.

985
01:50:50,906 --> 01:50:53,657
I'll wear the darned clothes
if you want me to...

986
01:50:53,742 --> 01:50:56,825
...if you'll just like me.

987
01:51:02,707 --> 01:51:04,580
The color of your hair.

988
01:51:10,631 --> 01:51:13,250
Judy, please. It can't matter to you.

989
01:51:24,183 --> 01:51:26,673
If I let you change me, will that do it?

990
01:51:27,227 --> 01:51:29,350
If I do what you tell me...

991
01:51:31,272 --> 01:51:32,766
...will you love me?

992
01:51:32,981 --> 01:51:34,012
Yes.

993
01:51:35,816 --> 01:51:37,441
- Yes.
- All right.

994
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:43,193
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.

995
01:51:52,455 --> 01:51:54,780
Come on. We'll sit by the fire.

996
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:17,756
I'm afraid it's going to take several hours.

997
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:21,978
The young lady thought you'd like to go
home. She'll join you when she's finished.

998
01:52:22,062 --> 01:52:25,430
No. Tell her I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.

999
01:52:26,107 --> 01:52:29,440
- You're sure about the color of the hair?
- Yes, it's an easy color.

1000
01:52:29,527 --> 01:52:31,898
- All the rest of...
- Yes, we know what you want.

1001
01:52:31,987 --> 01:52:33,315
Thank you.

1002
01:54:17,363 --> 01:54:18,477
Well?

1003
01:54:18,572 --> 01:54:22,236
It should be back from your face
and pinned at the neck. I told her that.

1004
01:54:22,325 --> 01:54:23,357
I told you that.

1005
01:54:24,368 --> 01:54:27,570
We tried it. It just didn't seem to suit me.

1006
01:54:33,584 --> 01:54:35,078
Please, Judy.

1007
01:57:40,775 --> 01:57:43,526
- Where shall we go for dinner?
- Anywhere you like.

1008
01:57:43,611 --> 01:57:46,944
- Ernie's?
- You have a thing about Ernie's, don't you?

1009
01:57:47,948 --> 01:57:49,986
After all, it's our place.

1010
01:57:53,786 --> 01:57:55,742
Hello, my love. Like me?

1011
01:57:58,039 --> 01:58:00,790
- Is that the best you can do?
- Come here.

1012
01:58:01,125 --> 01:58:02,619
No. You'll muss me.

1013
01:58:03,168 --> 01:58:05,540
That's what I had in mind. Come here.

1014
01:58:06,254 --> 01:58:08,376
It's too late. I got my face on.

1015
01:58:08,923 --> 01:58:10,465
I'm suddenly hungry.

1016
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:14,710
- Would you rather go somewhere else?
- No. Ernie's is fine.

1017
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:21,175
I'm gonna have one
of those big, beautiful steaks.

1018
01:58:21,891 --> 01:58:24,975
Let me see. To start I think I'll...

1019
01:58:26,854 --> 01:58:28,811
Help me with this, will you?

1020
01:58:31,775 --> 01:58:33,103
I have it.

1021
01:58:34,318 --> 01:58:37,235
- How do you work this thing?
- Can't you see?

1022
01:58:38,363 --> 01:58:42,063
- Now, there you are.
- Thank you. I'm just about ready.

1023
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:45,238
All I've gotta do is find my lipstick.

1024
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:48,075
Where did I put it? I had it a minute ago.

1025
01:59:01,382 --> 01:59:04,252
I wonder if it's here. Here it is.

1026
01:59:06,343 --> 01:59:07,802
There, I'm ready.

1027
01:59:10,389 --> 01:59:12,511
But first, muss me a little?

1028
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:18,847
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?

1029
01:59:21,898 --> 01:59:25,231
How would you like to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

1030
01:59:25,901 --> 01:59:29,815
- Maybe we could drive down the peninsula.
- All right. If you'd like.

1031
01:59:48,086 --> 01:59:49,912
We're going awfully far.

1032
01:59:50,004 --> 01:59:53,253
I just feel like driving.
Are you terribly hungry?

1033
01:59:54,174 --> 01:59:55,917
No, it's all right.

1034
02:00:16,316 --> 02:00:18,060
Where are you going?

1035
02:00:22,655 --> 02:00:24,942
One final thing I have to do...

1036
02:00:27,492 --> 02:00:29,816
...and then I'll be free of the past.

1037
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:52,292
Scottie, why are we here?

1038
02:00:52,678 --> 02:00:54,089
I told you.

1039
02:00:56,432 --> 02:00:58,590
I have to go back into the past once more.

1040
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:02,134
Just once more, for the last time.

1041
02:01:03,187 --> 02:01:04,681
Why? Why here?

1042
02:01:05,439 --> 02:01:07,477
Madeleine died here, Judy.

1043
02:01:09,567 --> 02:01:13,018
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait...
- No, I need you.

1044
02:01:13,278 --> 02:01:14,309
Why?

1045
02:01:15,322 --> 02:01:18,026
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.

1046
02:01:18,782 --> 02:01:21,487
And when it's done, we'll both be free.

1047
02:01:22,244 --> 02:01:25,612
- I'm scared.
- I have to tell you about Madeleine now.

1048
02:01:26,706 --> 02:01:28,081
Right there.

1049
02:01:29,291 --> 02:01:31,864
We stood there,
and I kissed her for the last time.

1050
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,795
She said, "If you lose me,
you'll know that I love you...

1051
02:01:34,879 --> 02:01:36,670
"...and wanted to keep loving you."

1052
02:01:36,756 --> 02:01:40,040
And I said, "I won't lose you." But I did.

1053
02:01:41,634 --> 02:01:43,212
And then she turned...

1054
02:01:45,096 --> 02:01:47,053
...and ran into the church.

1055
02:02:00,024 --> 02:02:02,645
When I followed her, it was too late.

1056
02:02:07,155 --> 02:02:08,898
I don't want to go in there!

1057
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:10,484
It was too late.

1058
02:02:18,413 --> 02:02:22,197
I couldn't find her,
and then I heard footsteps on the stairs.

1059
02:02:22,793 --> 02:02:24,831
She was running up the tower.

1060
02:02:24,919 --> 02:02:26,294
Right here.

1061
02:02:27,046 --> 02:02:29,370
See? She was running up the stairs...

1062
02:02:29,672 --> 02:02:32,508
...and through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.

1063
02:02:32,591 --> 02:02:35,628
I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.

1064
02:02:35,761 --> 02:02:38,465
I tried, but I couldn't get to the top.

1065
02:02:38,597 --> 02:02:40,885
One doesn't often get a second chance.

1066
02:02:40,973 --> 02:02:43,179
I want to stop being haunted.

1067
02:02:43,768 --> 02:02:47,384
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.

1068
02:02:47,479 --> 02:02:48,938
Take me away!

1069
02:02:49,230 --> 02:02:52,894
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

1070
02:02:52,983 --> 02:02:54,940
- No!
- Go up the stairs.

1071
02:02:57,695 --> 02:02:59,687
Go up the stairs, Judy...

1072
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:02,858
...and I'll follow.

1073
02:04:02,622 --> 02:04:05,705
This was as far as I could get,
but you went on.

1074
02:04:07,168 --> 02:04:08,412
Remember?

1075
02:04:09,378 --> 02:04:12,461
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.

1076
02:04:13,214 --> 02:04:15,087
I remembered the necklace.

1077
02:04:15,174 --> 02:04:17,843
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.

1078
02:04:17,926 --> 02:04:19,717
You can't! You're afraid!

1079
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:23,885
We'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.

1080
02:04:23,973 --> 02:04:25,087
Please!

1081
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:28,059
You knew that day
that I couldn't follow you.

1082
02:04:28,225 --> 02:04:31,096
- Who was up there? Elster and his wife?
- Yes.

1083
02:04:31,186 --> 02:04:34,520
And she was the one who died.
The real wife, not you.

1084
02:04:34,856 --> 02:04:37,263
You were the counterfeit, weren't you?

1085
02:04:37,358 --> 02:04:40,228
- Was she dead or alive...
- Dead! He'd broken her neck.

1086
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:43,402
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

1087
02:04:43,488 --> 02:04:47,070
When you got up there, he pushed her off,
but it was you who screamed.

1088
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:51,285
- Why did you scream?
- I wanted to stop it. I ran up to stop it...

1089
02:04:51,412 --> 02:04:55,739
Stop it? Why did you scream,
since you tricked me so well up to then?

1090
02:04:55,998 --> 02:04:59,995
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?

1091
02:05:00,168 --> 02:05:03,501
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.

1092
02:05:03,588 --> 02:05:08,083
Not only the clothes and the hair,
but the looks, the manner and the words...

1093
02:05:08,258 --> 02:05:10,166
...and those beautiful phony trances.

1094
02:05:10,259 --> 02:05:12,336
And you jumped into the Bay, didn't you?

1095
02:05:12,428 --> 02:05:15,263
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you?

1096
02:05:15,347 --> 02:05:16,971
- Aren't you?
- Yes!

1097
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:21,802
Then what did he do? Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?

1098
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:25,061
Did he tell you exactly what to do,
what to say?

1099
02:05:25,147 --> 02:05:28,016
You were a very apt pupil, too,
weren't you?

1100
02:05:29,442 --> 02:05:31,979
Why did you pick on me? Why me?

1101
02:05:32,068 --> 02:05:33,563
Your accident!

1102
02:05:34,028 --> 02:05:35,523
The accident!

1103
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:38,278
I was the setup, wasn't I?

1104
02:05:38,365 --> 02:05:40,607
I was a made-to-order witness.

1105
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:49,618
I made it.

1106
02:05:51,459 --> 02:05:54,128
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?

1107
02:05:56,713 --> 02:05:59,583
We're going up and look
at the scene of the crime.

1108
02:05:59,674 --> 02:06:01,168
Come on, Judy.

1109
02:06:13,393 --> 02:06:15,386
This is where it happened.

1110
02:06:17,605 --> 02:06:20,310
The two of you hid there
and waited for it to clear...

1111
02:06:20,398 --> 02:06:23,850
...then you sneaked down
and drove into town, is that it?

1112
02:06:24,068 --> 02:06:26,641
And then? You were his girl?

1113
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:29,363
What happened to you?

1114
02:06:29,948 --> 02:06:31,739
Did he ditch you?

1115
02:06:33,367 --> 02:06:35,194
With all of his wife's money...

1116
02:06:35,286 --> 02:06:39,199
...and all that freedom and power,
and he ditched you. What a shame.

1117
02:06:39,373 --> 02:06:42,077
But he knew he was safe.
He knew you couldn't talk.

1118
02:06:42,166 --> 02:06:44,787
- Did he give you anything?
- Some money.

1119
02:06:45,169 --> 02:06:48,085
And the necklace, Carlotta's necklace.

1120
02:06:49,214 --> 02:06:51,787
There was where you made
your mistake, Judy.

1121
02:06:51,883 --> 02:06:54,456
You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.

1122
02:06:59,096 --> 02:07:01,633
You shouldn't have been that sentimental.

1123
02:07:05,643 --> 02:07:07,683
I loved you so, Madeleine.

1124
02:07:12,023 --> 02:07:13,896
I was safe when you found me.

1125
02:07:13,983 --> 02:07:16,106
There was nothing that you could prove.

1126
02:07:16,193 --> 02:07:20,060
But when I saw you again,
I couldn't run away. I loved you so.

1127
02:07:20,822 --> 02:07:22,944
I walked into danger
and let you change me...

1128
02:07:23,032 --> 02:07:25,404
...because I loved you and I wanted you.

1129
02:07:28,161 --> 02:07:30,403
Scottie, please. You loved me.

1130
02:07:31,122 --> 02:07:33,827
- Keep me safe. Please!
- It's too late.

1131
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:36,620
It's too late. There's no bringing her back.

1132
02:07:36,751 --> 02:07:37,914
Please.

1133
02:07:50,346 --> 02:07:51,887
I heard voices.

1134
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:57,392
God have mercy.
