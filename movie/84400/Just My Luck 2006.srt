Dancing on the kitchen tiles

1493
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,162
It's all about you

1494
01:41:26,329 --> 01:41:27,413
Yeah

1495
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:32,334
And I would answer all your wishes

1496
01:41:32,502 --> 01:41:35,087
If you asked me to

1497
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:39,800
But if you deny me one of your kisses

1498
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:42,595
Don't know what I’d do

1499
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:46,265
So hold me close and say three words

1500
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:49,810
Like you used to do

1501
01:41:49,978 --> 01:41:53,522
Dancing on the kitchen tiles

1502
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:57,193
Yes, you make my life worthwhile

1503
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:03,199
So I told you with a smile

1504
01:42:03,366 --> 01:42:04,909
It's all about you

1505
01:42:05,076 --> 01:42:08,537
-It's all about you
-It's about you

1506
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:12,291
It's all about you, baby

1507
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:15,878
-It's all about you
-It's about you

1508
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:19,882
It's all about you

1509
01:42:20,091 --> 01:42:27,181
It's all about you
