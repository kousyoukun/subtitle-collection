1
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,615
I'm going in.

2
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:29,770
Oh!

3
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,009
<i>There is</i>

4
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,529
<i>an impossibly fine line</i>

5
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:16,152
<i>between sanity and madness.</i>

6
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:18,430
<i>And it's not always
possible to know</i>

7
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,261
which side
of that line we
are standing on.

8
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,781
The violence
between disparate sides

9
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,232
is not endemic
to this culture.

10
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,131
it is endemic
to all cultures.

11
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,445
We are again

12
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,722
tribes.

13
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,863
But defining

14
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:39,934
our tribe
is not as simple

15
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,902
as the black people
born under the sun,

16
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:43,731
or the white people
born under the moon.

17
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,597
Our division is,

18
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:48,702
wrong others

19
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:52,292
against right self.

20
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,708
And this division
does not rest

21
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,676
simply on
an unfamiliarity

22
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,747
with a tribe
other than our own.

23
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:01,197
It's deeper
than that.

24
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:02,232
Sir?

25
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:03,648
Yes?

26
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,996
It's the 21st century,
Dr. Mackles.

27
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:08,480
With my phone,
I can learn about

28
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,068
any culture
on the planet.

29
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,794
I'm a Google search away
from knowing

30
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,865
everything about
a belief system
in 20 minutes.

31
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:16,557
Let me ask you a question.

32
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:21,493
What if that
belief system
you Googled

33
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:24,289
was so antithetical
to your own,

34
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,568
that would seem,
for lack of a better word,

35
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:28,845
insane?

36
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,400
Like what?

37
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,194
Well, like, uh,

38
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:34,230
take medicine.

39
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,166
Here,
medicine is

40
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,858
all pharmaceutical compounds

41
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,619
created
in laboratories,

42
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:47,001
sold by faceless corporations
to millions.

43
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,073
In other parts
of the world,

44
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,491
medicine
is a plant.

45
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,736
A bit of bark,
a root,

46
00:05:58,634 --> 00:05:59,600
or a mineral.

47
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,121
Or a combination
of all of them.

48
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:04,605
Administered
to one man

49
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,159
by another man

50
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:11,440
who is believed
to channel powers

51
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,064
that you could not
begin to comprehend.

52
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:20,345
This medical knowledge
is based on ancient beliefs.

53
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,866
The tenets of which
in this country,

54
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,454
it would just make
your blood run cold.

55
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,874
Metaphysical
beliefs in healing
and humanity.

56
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,083
That would seem, um,

57
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,498
insane to you,

58
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,363
no matter how hard
you tried to understand them.

59
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,917
But it is
the very belief
in such things

60
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,540
that gives
this medicine
it's power.

61
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,163
Looks like we're
out of time.

62
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,373
So, we'll take this
up again
next week.

63
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,377
Thank you.

64
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:58,832
Mr. Hobbs.

65
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,111
I want you
to do something
for me.

66
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:04,907
A little extra credit,
if you will.

67
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,289
I want you to take
that phone
in your pocket

68
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:11,983
and find me
a culture that is so
inverse to your own

69
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,986
that the idea
of it taking root
here, in this city,

70
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,057
would scare
the bejesus
out of you.

71
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:18,955
Yes, sir.

72
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:52,955
Get the fuck
in there!

73
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,129
Don't fucking move.

74
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,236
No! Wait!

75
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,409
- Hey!
Stop!

76
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,480
What are you doing
in there?

77
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,550
I'm Detective Boyd.

78
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,620
Get away from me!

79
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,276
- Calm down, it's okay.
I don't wanna go.

80
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,381
Please?

81
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:07,245
No. What's he
doing with her?
That's mine!

82
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:08,833
Shut the fuck up!

83
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,213
You can't take her!

84
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,352
I'm Detective Boyd.

85
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:13,044
- She's mine!
Don't talk to her!

86
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,150
Come on, give me you hand.

87
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,289
What are you
doing with her?

88
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:19,360
Keep your hands up!

89
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,158
Look, I'm gonna get you
outta here. Come on.

90
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,401
- Maria?
- Hey, where are you going?

91
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,782
- Maria?
- Where you going?

92
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,369
You can't take her!

93
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,545
Hey, man.

94
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,615
Get on your fucking--She stays with me, pal.

95
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:33,892
Get down on your feet now.

96
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,687
I didn't do
anything wrong, man.

97
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,620
- Yeah?
- She came willingly
with me.

98
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,139
I told you, get on
your fucking feet!

99
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,520
Nah! You go
to hell, bitch.

100
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,108
You first.

101
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,957
No, no, no, no!

102
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,585
We need him alive!

103
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:33,727
Medics are on the way.

104
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:05,957
Then go to hell!

105
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,476
You first.

106
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,958
Mr. Farner.

107
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,718
Mr. Randoku.
It is an honor, sir.

108
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:47,240
A man like you,
who is so powerful.

109
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,726
Tell me, why do you
want to do this?

110
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,521
Who is interviewing who?

111
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:53,729
I am interviewing
you, sir.

112
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,664
I do not do business
with anyone,

113
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,804
I do not know
everything about.

114
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:02,186
Neither do I.

115
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,291
Mr. Randoku,
I'm a man who
explores options

116
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,328
of power,
as you say.

117
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,571
It is elusive.

118
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:10,263
You are a man
who harvests power,

119
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,472
and bottles it even.

120
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:15,924
You're also a man
with a lot of eyes
on you right now.

121
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,684
I have a plane
that can take you
anywhere you like.

122
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:25,071
Appreciate
the kind words, sir.

123
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,556
I do not
need your help.

124
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,110
You... need me.

125
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,738
Let me know
when you are ready.

126
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:47,714
Think of the souls
you could've harvested
there, Mr. Randoku.

127
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,930
Detective Boyd,
did you feel
any sense of vindication

128
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,276
when you fired
at the suspect?

129
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,417
Other than it was
him or me? No.

130
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,835
Did the death of your
own daughter in any way

131
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:08,148
affect your decision
to fire on Mr. Preston?

132
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,185
No.

133
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,913
Let's be honest, Ms. Cannon.

134
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,260
Mr. Preston was clearly
leaning forward

135
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,468
at the time
of the shooting,

136
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:18,952
reaching for a gun.

137
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:21,679
Any more questions?

138
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:38,489
<i>You okay?</i>

139
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,080
Yeah.

140
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,739
That's not convincing.

141
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,950
No, I'm okay.

142
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:57,818
I had another bad dream.

143
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,581
Do you want
to talk about it?

144
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:05,792
No. Not really.

145
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,239
<i>Hello?</i>

146
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,275
Yes, it' s me.

147
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,174
Let's move forward.

148
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,798
I'll wire
what we agreed upon.

149
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:00,311
Go, go, go, go, go!

150
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,806
You got it!

151
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,667
All right,
you go first.

152
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,220
I'm just kidding. Yeah.

153
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:49,429
What's going on?

154
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,640
You might have fooled
the review board,

155
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,194
but don't you think
you can fool me.

156
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,264
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:57,955
Now, you get your ass

158
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,027
over to the shrink
and see if you can fool her.

159
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,580
I think I'm having
a hard time hearing you

160
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,203
'cause all I can hear
are the voices.

161
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,204
You know?

162
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:08,207
Fuckers... You having fun?

163
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,208
Yeah, loads.

164
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,777
<i>I was thinking maybe
you should take a vacation.</i>

165
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:27,881
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

166
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm just curious.
Where would you send me?

167
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,022
Anywhere but here.

168
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,093
And do what?

169
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,095
I don't know. Fish.

170
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:36,856
Go out on
- a charter boat.
- Fish?

171
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,927
Drop a line
in the water.

172
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:40,239
Maria, that sounds
fucking horrible.

173
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,965
Well, you need it.

174
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,525
Between you and I
- and just us.
- Yeah?

175
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,871
Was he really
going for his gun?

176
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,255
Maria, let me ask
you a question.

177
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,980
Do you think anybody
misses Ted Bundy?

178
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,430
That's not an answer.

179
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,605
No. It is,
if you're listening.

180
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:03,434
Fuck that.

181
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,884
You want me to get that?

182
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,817
- Yeah, you get that.
- This is 130 reporting.

183
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,590
What do we got, Jimmy?

184
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,248
A floater.
Caucasian female.

185
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,146
She's been dead,
maybe 6 hours.

186
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:31,393
Oh, fuck.

187
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:33,775
Any ID?

188
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:34,948
No. Nothing.

189
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,778
Age?

190
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,297
Maybe 14, 15.

191
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:43,854
Somebody did
a real number on her.

192
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,307
Her hands, genitals
have been removed.

193
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,756
You mean,
crabs got to her?

194
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,484
You don't lose the parts
she's missing to wildlife.

195
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,694
She was cut
before she was dumped.

196
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,638
If it wasn't a scalpel,
it was something
just as sharp.

197
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:13,021
Eyes, eyelids.

198
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,194
Yeah.

199
00:22:14,194 --> 00:22:16,231
Left hand, missing.

200
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:17,853
Gone.

201
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,269
You think that's what
killed her, Bill?

202
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:23,169
No. Death was
a courtesy of this.

203
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:27,138
Throat cut. Bled out.

204
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,968
Her veins are
full of river silt.

205
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,627
The only DNA we found
was that of hers.

206
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:35,181
And these marks.

207
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,666
Look at these.

208
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,219
It's like
some kind of rope.

209
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:41,256
Hung by her feet.

210
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:43,016
Like a side of beef.

211
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,330
Goddamn.

212
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,510
This isn't
getting any better.

213
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,133
I'll know more later.
All right.

214
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,342
Thanks, doc.
Can you send it
upstairs for me?

215
00:22:58,342 --> 00:22:59,930
Yeah.
Thank you.

216
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,451
- You okay?
- Hmm?

217
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,142
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

218
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:08,904
Just give me a second.

219
00:23:38,762 --> 00:23:41,247
All right, gang related or...

220
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,180
No, no, no, no.
This ain't gang related.

221
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,284
No?

222
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:46,045
It's more methodical.
Somebody with a purpose.

223
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:48,599
Yeah. With a purpose, right?

224
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,463
Come on, Boyd.
You don't know that yet.

225
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:52,914
What if he's right?

226
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,985
About what?

227
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,470
You have other cases
with so much better leads.

228
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,024
Now just do your job.
Get the hell out of here.

229
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:01,612
Captain?
- Yeah?

230
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:03,442
You didn't see
what she looked like.

231
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,828
What are you thinking?

232
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,866
I'm thinking
another good cop
became a bureaucrat.

233
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:15,523
Well, how about
I buy you a drink?

234
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,662
Sounds great.

235
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,940
Ooh!

236
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,287
Yo! That's a brick!

237
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,289
Oh, come on, dude!
Hit me! I'm open! I'm open!

238
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,359
Air ball!

239
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:27,051
Shoot it! Shoot it!

240
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,052
I think that's a foul!

241
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,298
Oh, you suck, bro.

242
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:34,403
Hey, pass it to me.

243
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:36,475
Yes! Yes!

244
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,855
He did it!

245
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,104
Why didn't you
let me play?

246
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,002
You know Jamie shoots
nothing but bricks.

247
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,073
It's time to go,
little bro.

248
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,143
Wait. Where am I going?

249
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,147
Well, you're
going home.

250
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:55,804
But I wanna
play with you.

251
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,599
You're going home.
It's getting late.

252
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,601
Mom's gonna be worried.
You know, you got homework.

253
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,500
But you never did
your homework.

254
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,949
I'm not
as smart as you.

255
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:04,364
You got a brain.
You can use it.

256
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:05,504
You need
to go study.

257
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,333
Come on.

258
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:15,583
Dunk it up your ass.

259
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,591
Whoo!

260
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:44,163
No, let me go!

261
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:46,096
Let me out of here!

262
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:48,857
This kid is great.

263
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:50,341
That is fucking,
it's true and he--

264
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:53,344
He continuously just
does not run the ball.

265
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,520
You know, you don't
have to be dealing

266
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,177
with something
like this, after...

267
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:00,420
After what?
What do you mean?

268
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,698
You know, Lucas.

269
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,909
Oh, Christ.

270
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,600
Are you talking
about my daughter?

271
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,740
Well, yeah. And...

272
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,605
Maria, I'm dealing with it
the best way I know how.

273
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,676
I'm just saying,
if it were me,

274
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:15,884
I'd be gone in a heartbeat.

275
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:17,817
Well, it ain't you.
And I'm not you.

276
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:19,647
Come on now.

277
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:23,305
I'm no shrink.

278
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,309
That's for fucking sure,
you aren't a shrink.

279
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:32,625
What?

280
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:36,940
- I'm just gonna be your friend.
- Thank you.

281
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,355
Okay.

282
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:39,977
Be great.
You know what friends do?

283
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,082
They order shots.

284
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,256
Why don't you
- buy me a shot?
- Okay.

285
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:44,982
Get us
- a couple of shots.
- Okay.

286
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:46,708
Okay? Come on. Fine.

287
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,616
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

288
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,928
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

289
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,794
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

290
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,557
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

291
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:17,359
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

292
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:21,674
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

293
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:25,505
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

294
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,889
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

295
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:33,513
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

296
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,448
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

297
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:40,797
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

298
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,940
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

299
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,322
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

300
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,934
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

301
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:26,419
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

302
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:30,769
He was called in
missing about one a.m.

303
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,909
Some kids found him here.

304
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:36,084
Wife said,
he goes out fishing,
but never out past 10:00.

305
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,741
My guess is that
he came upon something

306
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:39,087
he wasn't supposed to see.

307
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,537
Yeah.
Anything else?

308
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:41,987
Oh, yeah.
There's more.

309
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:43,436
You're gonna
wanna see this.

310
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:53,619
<i>Mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

311
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,586
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

312
00:29:56,484 --> 00:29:57,657
What do we got, Nick?

313
00:29:57,657 --> 00:30:00,005
Hispanic male,
about 10 years old.

314
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,628
Looks exactly like
what we saw
at the river yesterday.

315
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:03,663
Shit.

316
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:43,842
Nick, make sure
I get a picture
of that, please.

317
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,877
Okay.

318
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:51,815
<i>The old man
would've died anyway</i>

319
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,748
from his throat
being cut,

320
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,475
if he'd had a heart left
to pump the blood out.

321
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,890
What?

322
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,927
His heart had been
sliced out clean,

323
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,343
and there was no blood
in his throat.

324
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:05,484
So whoever did this,
it was awfully quick.

325
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,382
I mean, when you say
quick, like, how quick?

326
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:09,453
I mean, like his heart
might've still been beating.

327
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,938
But what about
the heart? Did you find it?

328
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,146
No.

329
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:13,664
No?
- No. Didn't find it.

330
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,737
What about the boy?

331
00:31:17,737 --> 00:31:19,774
Well, the boy
was like the first girl.

332
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:21,534
- Yeah?
- Mutilated.

333
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:24,952
Parts cut off. Missing.

334
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:29,025
One thing. Whatever
this guy is using,

335
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:30,302
is sharp as hell.

336
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:31,855
Okay.

337
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:33,615
Want a little snoot?

338
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:34,927
Got some
good whiskey here.

339
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,204
Yeah, I'll take
a little snoot.

340
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,275
And there's
another, uh...

341
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,726
another thing interesting.

342
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:41,969
Yeah?

343
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,557
Remember those things
you brought from the altar?

344
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:45,765
Yes, sir.

345
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,975
Well...

346
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:51,840
Cheers.

347
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:56,776
This one...

348
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:00,988
It's finely
powdered gold.

349
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,369
What do you
mean, gold?

350
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,578
Like Fort Knox Gold.

351
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,166
No shit.

352
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:09,513
And these...

353
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:13,586
These are some
- herbs you brought.
- Yeah?

354
00:32:13,586 --> 00:32:15,657
I've been able
to ID one of 'em.

355
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,246
And it's, uh,

356
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:19,834
something called rooibos.

357
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,181
What's that?

358
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:23,976
Well, there's been
some research on it.

359
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,565
It's from Africa.
It's a red tea.

360
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,670
Mmm. It ain't
that kinda tea though.

361
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:31,294
Thanks, Bill.

362
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,502
Not like you drink.

363
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,007
Shit. Excuse me.

364
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,733
Do you know where
Dr. Mackles' office is?

365
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:58,252
- That way.
- It's back this way?

366
00:32:58,252 --> 00:32:59,253
- Yeah.
- Gosh.

367
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:17,685
Come in.

368
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:23,932
May I help you?

369
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:25,003
Well, I hope so.

370
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:27,695
Are you Dr. Mackles?

371
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,179
Yes.

372
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:30,939
I'm homicide
detective Lucas Boyd.

373
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:33,597
Do you mind if I sit?

374
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:39,810
So, you teach
African studies,
is that right?

375
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,433
Yes.

376
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,573
Are you
from Africa?

377
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,438
Yes. Lesotho.

378
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,268
Where is that at?

379
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,822
It's a small country
in the heart of South Africa.

380
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:52,858
Oh.

381
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:56,689
Is my being African
important?

382
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:58,346
Well, again,
I hope so.

383
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,452
Do you, uh, know
what rooibos is?

384
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,663
Yes. It's tea.

385
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,182
Just tea?

386
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:10,738
Well, it's sometimes
used medicinally.

387
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:11,808
Mmm-hmm.

388
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:20,989
Um, smell this,
and tell me what
it is, will you?

389
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:39,077
Where did you get this?

390
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,150
Why? What is it?

391
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:50,398
Dr. Mackles.
What is it?

392
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,885
It's... herbs.

393
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,889
Mmm-hmm.
Just any kind of herbs?

394
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:02,997
Well, I would say
yohimbe bark

395
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:08,106
and, uh, some other
fermented tree roots.

396
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,590
Hmm.

397
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,936
Where'd you get it?

398
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:13,111
I found it
at a crime scene.

399
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,499
What kind of crime?

400
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,676
Well, I'm a homicide
detective, sir.

401
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,584
Can you tell me
what these writings are?

402
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:46,040
You could easily
google this, Detective.

403
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,076
I know. I know.
And I actually did.

404
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:49,181
It didn't
make sense to me.

405
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,253
But then I did Google

406
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:55,291
leading scholars
in African culture,
and your name came up,

407
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,775
as the best
and brightest.

408
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,916
So, here I am.

409
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:07,682
I'm sorry.
I cannot help you.

410
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:14,965
Well, I appreciate
your time, sir.

411
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,018
I'm just looking
for someone.

412
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:10,124
A ghost.

413
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:14,439
I need to put a name
to this face.

414
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:18,788
I've seen him around.

415
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:19,892
Great.

416
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:23,275
He's my main suspect
in some strange killings.

417
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:26,554
We found an altar.

418
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:28,349
Blood.

419
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,833
I don't really know
what it means.

420
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,425
He's a Sangoma.

421
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:38,601
Sangoma?

422
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:40,982
Touched by God.

423
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:42,812
A witch doctor.

424
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:44,917
He works for clients.

425
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:47,851
What kind of clients?

426
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:51,372
Rich and powerful ones.

427
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,170
May I give you
a word of advice?

428
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:57,999
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,036
Be careful.

430
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,694
He could be
coming for you.

431
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:14,809
Thank you.

432
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:18,917
Is everything okay?

433
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:46,979
Dr. Mackles,
I need your help.

434
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:50,258
God dam it,
two kids are dead.

435
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,053
They were
butchered like hogs.

436
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:55,125
You know what these
writings are, don't you?

437
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,990
Now, please,

438
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,027
take another look.

439
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,652
I cannot help you.

440
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,896
Can't or won't?

441
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,216
You're scared,
aren't you?

442
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:51,596
Watch your step, doctor.

443
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:07,784
Oh.

444
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:15,274
What is it, doctor?

445
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:18,726
It's Swahili.

446
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:20,832
Zulu.

447
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,040
Hmm.

448
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,835
It identifies territory.

449
00:40:24,698 --> 00:40:26,113
Identifies how?

450
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:29,012
Uh, centers
of power, or...

451
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,740
ways to get access
to that power.

452
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:36,641
Do me a favor. Can you
read that right there?

453
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:40,507
Well, roughly.

454
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:49,481
Uh, "Here
I take the power.

455
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,104
"Here I become the power."

456
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,074
Your man is a Sangoma.

457
00:40:57,178 --> 00:40:59,387
A medicine man.

458
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:01,562
In your culture, you would
call him a witch doctor.

459
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,153
The way he's killing,
that makes sense.

460
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:11,503
You ever hear the term
<i>"Muti,"</i> Detective?

461
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:12,987
No.

462
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:17,060
It's Zulu.
It means medicine.

463
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,062
But, Muti has
a dark side.

464
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,035
So, are you saying
that he is using
the body parts for medicine?

465
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:28,106
Exactly.

466
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:29,279
- Right.
- Well,

467
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,040
you know, pharmaceutical companies

468
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,871
use stem cells from aborted
fetuses to create vaccines.

469
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:35,976
Right.

470
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,495
Well, this is just
a primitive version

471
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,979
of that concept.

472
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:40,359
I'm listening.

473
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:42,051
Well, in
a metaphysical sense,

474
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:45,917
<i>it can be tied to
what can be referred to</i>

475
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,022
<i>as "the warrior tradition."</i>

476
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,991
<i>Put simply, it's a ritual
performed to order.</i>

477
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,682
<i>To make one a warrior,</i>

478
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:55,927
<i>or to provide power
to that warrior.</i>

479
00:41:55,927 --> 00:42:00,000
<i>Sangomas have been
practicing</i> Muti <i>for centuries.</i>

480
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:09,078
<i>Businessmen,
politicians, salesmen, you,</i>

481
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,458
<i>anyone.</i>

482
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:15,015
<i>People who pay for</i> Muti
<i>are seeking</i>

483
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:16,775
<i>personal success,</i>

484
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:17,880
<i>power,</i>

485
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,571
<i>protection.</i>

486
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:24,818
<i>They believe that</i> Muti
<i>strengthens their
personal force,</i>

487
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:26,302
<i>gives them an edge.</i>

488
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:33,896
In <i>Muti,</i>
specific body parts

489
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:35,345
have a distinct effect.

490
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,554
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,384
Genitals,

492
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:44,734
they bring virility,
good luck.

493
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:48,220
Especially if
- they're virgin.
- Right.

494
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,189
The eyes, farsightedness,

495
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,639
clarity of vision.

496
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:54,226
The brain,

497
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:56,953
knowledge,
political power.

498
00:42:56,953 --> 00:42:58,196
Mmm-hmm.

499
00:42:58,196 --> 00:43:01,095
The Sangoma takes
whatever they need

500
00:43:01,095 --> 00:43:02,269
for a specific outcome.

501
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,654
- Jesus Christ.
- But, there's more.

502
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:14,384
A Sangoman must
take the flesh

503
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,559
while the victim
is still alive...

504
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:17,629
Right.

505
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,874
In order to get
the power they seek...

506
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:22,082
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:24,118
...they must awaken
the gods to bestow it.

508
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:27,052
Which means...

509
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:29,883
the screams
of the victim...

510
00:43:29,883 --> 00:43:31,263
Right.

511
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:32,299
...are critical.

512
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,061
The more intense
the scream,

513
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:39,168
the more powerful
the <i>Muti.</i>

514
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:45,761
Then the body parts
are mixed with
the victim's blood,

515
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,074
herbs, clay, gold,

516
00:43:49,074 --> 00:43:50,420
all of which is believed

517
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,423
to attract and hold power.

518
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:59,637
That elixir is drunk
by the client
or the Sangoma,

519
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:04,158
in order to get
the power they seek.

520
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:08,749
They believe
that it turns them
into a warrior.

521
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:09,992
Makes them a warrior.

522
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:11,614
And an undefeatable one.

523
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,755
Sounds unbelievable
to me.

524
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:18,241
Right. To you, Detective.

525
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:22,521
To him,
it's simply business.
And very real.

526
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,523
Very real.

527
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:28,907
Whatever he's
about to do,

528
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,911
it feels he needs
power to do it.

529
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:33,912
Mmm-hmm.

530
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:36,294
And understand this.

531
00:44:37,882 --> 00:44:38,952
These first two,

532
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:41,748
they were just
him getting ready.

533
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:44,371
He did them for himself.

534
00:44:46,994 --> 00:44:47,995
<i>Capisce?</i>

535
00:44:52,241 --> 00:44:53,898
Do you really
believe in this?

536
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:58,385
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

537
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:03,217
This is just
too sick.

538
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,119
I mean, Maria,
it's sick enough
to be real, you know.

539
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,362
I just wish I could see
this motherfucker's face.

540
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:15,574
All I see right now
is a monster.

541
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,566
I want one that's beautiful.
One with pretty eyes.

542
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:47,158
One filled with
life and promise.

543
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,367
Oh, I want her to have
a great deal of intelligence.

544
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:54,544
And so much more
to live for.

545
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:34,999
Welcome.

546
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:39,348
What can I
- get for you?
- Tequila.

547
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:42,661
Neat, or on the rocks?

548
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:43,870
Neat. Okay.

549
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:49,323
Are you
new in town?

550
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,601
Yes.

551
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,741
Vacation?

552
00:46:53,741 --> 00:46:55,398
- No, work.
- Mmm.

553
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:57,504
That's a really
cool accent.

554
00:46:58,539 --> 00:46:59,575
I like it.
Where is it from?

555
00:47:00,507 --> 00:47:02,474
I've been
so many places.

556
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:03,613
It is hard to say.

557
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:13,451
May I be honest?

558
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:14,486
Oh, sure.

559
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,800
I like your eyes.

560
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,939
Thank you.

561
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:22,287
They are lovely.
Stop it.

562
00:47:25,773 --> 00:47:26,982
I mean it.

563
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:27,983
I really like them.

564
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:29,570
Thank you.

565
00:47:30,295 --> 00:47:31,296
I really mean it, too.

566
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:35,818
Hey.

567
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,858
I could use
eyes like that.

568
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,449
My name is Randoku.

569
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:52,214
What is your name?

570
00:47:53,387 --> 00:47:54,388
Randoku.

571
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:56,287
I like that.

572
00:47:58,703 --> 00:47:59,704
I'm Terry.

573
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,778
Tell me all
about yourself, Terry.

574
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:20,828
This is just
a summer job for me.

575
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,521
- You are in school?
- Yeah.

576
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:25,178
Yeah. I'm pre-med
at the university.

577
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,870
So, you are smart.

578
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,907
I guess.

579
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,117
This matches the van
that was reported stolen
two weeks ago.

580
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:34,118
Clear here?

581
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:36,810
Yeah,
it's clear here.

582
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:41,470
Mmm, you wouldn't really
know it from meeting me
in this place,

583
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,507
but, I'm in the top
one percent of my class.

584
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,233
I like that.

585
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:47,855
Let's see
if Terry knows anything.

586
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,073
Hey, Terry.
- Hey.

587
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:02,732
Either of you
wouldn't happen to know
anything about that van...

588
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:23,684
<i>No, no. I get it.</i>

589
00:49:23,684 --> 00:49:26,239
It's a witch doctor
from Africa...

590
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:27,619
Yeah,
- that's right.
- And I should

591
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,345
believe this
because what?

592
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:32,038
According to Dr. Mackles,
he's servicing a client.

593
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:34,833
Hmm.

594
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:38,078
You believe
in this shit?

595
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,942
You know what,
I wanna go back to work.

596
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:41,530
Hey, Boyd. Sit down.

597
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,152
Boyd!

598
00:49:43,152 --> 00:49:44,395
I think he's
onto something.

599
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:46,224
Yeah, like what?

600
00:49:46,224 --> 00:49:47,985
Captain, we have
two officers down.

601
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:50,401
Get Boyd.

602
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:23,606
Is your name Terry?

603
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:27,093
Ma'am?

604
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:29,854
Hey, it's okay.

605
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:33,340
I need to ask you
a few questions, okay,

606
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,136
and if you can
help me out with that,

607
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:37,655
then maybe
we can find this guy.

608
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:39,174
Are you gonna
help me out? Yeah?

609
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:41,107
- Sure.
- Yeah? All right.

610
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:43,074
So, tell me, what,
what did he look like?

611
00:50:43,902 --> 00:50:45,559
Was he big,
tall, or what?

612
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:46,871
- He was big.
- Yeah?

613
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:48,355
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:50,978
When you say big,
like, over six feet,
or what?

615
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,842
- I think so.
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,396
Black? White?
Where?

617
00:50:55,673 --> 00:50:57,226
- He was a black guy.
- He was.

618
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,022
He was kind of handsome.

619
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:01,748
Yeah.

620
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:06,097
And, he was covered
with scarification
on his face.

621
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,409
He had scarring
on his face?

622
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:11,482
Did you get a name
by any chance? Yeah?

623
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:13,380
What was his name?

624
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,037
Terry, what was his name?

625
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,556
Randoku.

626
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:18,592
- Randoku?
- Randoku.

627
00:51:18,592 --> 00:51:19,697
Okay.

628
00:51:19,697 --> 00:51:21,423
All right, come on.
Let me get you up.

629
00:51:21,423 --> 00:51:23,252
Come on.
Let me help you.

630
00:51:24,978 --> 00:51:25,979
Maria.

631
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:33,814
We got a name. Randoku.

632
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:35,299
Go on, let's sort
that out. Come on.

633
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,166
Jimmy, anything?

634
00:51:41,408 --> 00:51:43,824
Yeah.
Lots of anythings.

635
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:47,587
- Yeah?
- Got a thumb, forefinger,
ring finger.

636
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:48,933
Okay.

637
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:50,590
Good thing your boy
likes tequila.

638
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,939
You're saying he's
about 6, 6'3", 6'4" maybe?6'4", I would say, yeah.

639
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:57,390
Jimmy, give me a name
on these prints.

640
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,012
These weird, uh,
scars on his face.

641
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:00,807
Scars on his face.
Thank you.
Thank you. Boyd.

642
00:52:00,807 --> 00:52:02,567
This lady said she just seen
a black guy coming in and out

643
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:03,948
of that unfinished
apartment building.

644
00:52:03,948 --> 00:52:05,674
Hadn't seen him around
until a few days ago.

645
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:07,469
Said he has
scars on his face.

646
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:08,780
That's our guy.
Come on, let's go.

647
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,092
Hey, Keith.

648
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:12,198
Watch the front.
Let's go. Come on.

649
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:13,958
Come on.
Gotta go! Gotta go!

650
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:35,117
I want everybody on two.

651
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:36,774
And let's communicate.

652
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:37,878
Roger that.

653
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:39,708
Bobby,
- you stay here.
- Copy that.

654
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:32,752
He's been here.

655
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:50,459
Fuck.

656
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:03,438
There he goes!

657
00:55:03,438 --> 00:55:05,232
Shit! He's coming back
on the third floor.

658
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:06,363
Freeze!
Claussen get the fuck down!

659
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:10,643
Officer down.
Officer down!

660
00:56:10,643 --> 00:56:11,851
Son of a bitch!

661
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:13,197
<i>Backup. Hang in with me now.</i>

662
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:15,510
Fuck!
We got officers down.
Go, go, go!

663
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,063
<i>Officer down. He's injured.</i>

664
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:25,796
Maria, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

665
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:31,905
Maria, let's go.

666
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:35,461
Yo, let's go.

667
00:56:38,878 --> 00:56:40,120
Jesus Christ.

668
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:43,089
Okay, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

669
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:44,401
Hey, give me
your fucking jacket!

670
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:49,578
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go!

671
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:06,664
I'm hoping
you see something
I wouldn't.

672
00:57:07,596 --> 00:57:08,563
I'll try.

673
00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:14,845
After you.

674
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,056
So why'd you
come here
to America?

675
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,748
New start, I guess.

676
00:57:21,748 --> 00:57:24,648
Yeah? You got
any family?

677
00:57:24,648 --> 00:57:27,374
No. My brothers
and sisters are
still back in Africa.

678
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,655
Take a look
at this.

679
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,106
My father
worked in medicine.

680
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:37,902
He worked
with the tribes.

681
00:57:39,283 --> 00:57:40,595
My mother worked
with him.

682
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:42,804
Mmm.

683
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,289
Well,
for what it's worth,

684
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:46,911
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this shit.

685
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:48,395
No, you're not.

686
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:50,605
You're right. I'm not.

687
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,367
You know,
in certain cultures,

688
00:57:54,367 --> 00:57:57,474
I could have your head
or another body part.

689
00:57:58,336 --> 00:57:59,855
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

690
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:01,788
As an apology
to make me feel better.

691
00:58:01,788 --> 00:58:02,927
Mmm.

692
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:06,897
Greece, Asia,
certain African tribes.

693
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:09,416
If a certain member
of a tribe offended
another member

694
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:12,454
by delving too deeply
into his personal affairs,

695
00:58:12,454 --> 00:58:14,801
the chief could have
that person killed

696
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:17,424
and the body part
delivered as a gift.

697
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:18,460
Hmm.

698
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:21,532
A way of saying,
problem solved.

699
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:26,088
Well, thank God
that ain't legal
in this country.

700
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:28,090
I'd be mailing out
body parts
all day long.

701
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,333
Let me know
if you need anything.

702
00:59:23,801 --> 00:59:24,768
Nothing.

703
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:27,253
Sorry, Detective.

704
00:59:32,914 --> 00:59:33,880
You're still here?

705
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:36,849
This fucker killed
two of my men.

706
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:38,816
You're okay?

707
00:59:41,923 --> 00:59:45,133
Ten children in Tanzania
kidnapped and killed
for body parts.

708
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:48,585
A dozen children
in Spain.

709
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,966
Thousand of children are
missing all across Europe.

710
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:52,899
And you ask me
how I'm doing?

711
00:59:52,899 --> 00:59:53,969
You can't
let it get to you.

712
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:56,593
That's what I keep
telling myself.

713
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:00,251
But how hard does your heart
have to get in order to live?

714
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:03,220
Maybe you
should go home.

715
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:05,291
Be with your family.

716
01:00:06,223 --> 01:00:07,293
My family, yeah.

717
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:09,606
You're right.

718
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:14,611
I think
there comes a day
in everyone's life where

719
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,716
they realize
they don't really
matter much.

720
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:20,030
Whatever their goals are

721
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,445
really don't
amount to shit.

722
01:00:24,793 --> 01:00:26,381
And that is
a very sad day.

723
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:29,177
Oh, thank you.

724
01:00:39,463 --> 01:00:41,189
You're a fucking
piece of work, Lucas.

725
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:45,849
<i>You're a fucking...</i> LUCAS: <i>We're not doing this.</i>

726
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:47,851
<i>We're not doing this again?
We're not doing this again?</i>

727
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:48,921
<i>You know what
you're not gonna do it?</i>

728
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:50,819
You fell asleep again!

729
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:52,476
You're gonna go
sleep again, yeah?

730
01:00:52,476 --> 01:00:55,203
Yeah, like you did before?

731
01:00:55,203 --> 01:00:56,653
<i>Come on,
what do you want me to say?</i>

732
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,895
<i>You fucking
piece of... LUCAS: Come on.</i>

733
01:00:57,895 --> 01:00:59,966
- Son of a bitch!
Come on, come on.

734
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:15,913
I need some
of your brew.

735
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:18,433
Come on in.

736
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,687
What's going on?
You doing okay?

737
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:32,447
Yeah.

738
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:38,695
I take it you never saw
that shrink, did you?

739
01:01:40,835 --> 01:01:41,801
Mmm.

740
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:44,735
There was something
that I wanted to show you,

741
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:47,565
I found in Randoku's apartment
the other day.

742
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:50,223
Look at this. It's, uh,
it's Farner Ltd.

743
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:53,882
It's a multibillion dollar, multinational,
mega corporation.

744
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:55,953
- Good one.
- Have you ever heard of...

745
01:01:55,953 --> 01:01:58,369
Farner company.
I know that asshole.

746
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:01,787
Donates a lot of money.

747
01:02:01,787 --> 01:02:03,305
I don't know.
I guess the question
is though

748
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:05,169
is what they're
talking about here
is that

749
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:06,895
there's a big vote Tuesday.

750
01:02:06,895 --> 01:02:08,586
How important
do you think
this is to him?

751
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:12,729
Hold.

752
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:15,214
It's Lucas.

753
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:21,323
They have something
in forensics.
We'll be right down. Thanks.

754
01:02:21,323 --> 01:02:23,463
I got this
from the bar.

755
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:25,534
But there were
no matches
in US database,

756
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,744
so, I checked Interpol,
and I got this.

757
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,953
When I superimpose them,

758
01:02:30,712 --> 01:02:33,611
I give you one
M'Gushu Randoku.

759
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:36,822
Born in South Africa,
Zulu heritage.

760
01:02:36,822 --> 01:02:39,445
Says he was
in Rome recently.

761
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:41,412
What about
his port of entry?
Where was it?

762
01:02:41,412 --> 01:02:42,724
Uh...

763
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:46,107
Came into New Orleans
a week ago.

764
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:47,418
Anything else?

765
01:02:47,418 --> 01:02:50,042
Well, yeah.
Old M'Gushu here?

766
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:51,595
Been dead for six years.

767
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:54,218
Here's his

768
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:56,876
death certificate signed
by a Sudanese General.

769
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:58,429
That doesn't
mean he's dead.

770
01:02:58,429 --> 01:03:02,709
It might just mean
he has friends in high places
who can help him disappear.

771
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:04,884
He ain't dead. Not yet.

772
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:10,062
Hey, Lucas.

773
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:12,340
Yeah?

774
01:03:12,996 --> 01:03:14,860
How's Kersch?

775
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,723
She's fighting
for her life, Claussen.

776
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,278
Check this out.

777
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:21,280
This was
in Randoku's place.

778
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:26,112
- Shit.
- Not sure
what it's about.

779
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:27,527
You know what, I'll look
- into it, thanks.
- All right.

780
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:28,943
You got it.

781
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:56,971
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

782
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:58,765
Yes.
Can I help you?

783
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:01,527
<i>This is Detective Lucas Boyd.
I'm calling from America.</i>

784
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:06,325
I need to speak to a uh,
I think it's
Inspector, uh, Mario Lavazzi?

785
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:08,741
I'm sorry, but he's
left for the day, Detective.

786
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:10,950
Okay, well,
you don't understand.
This is an emergency.

787
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,263
I'm investigating a murder
of two children.

788
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:15,368
Now, I'd love
if you could get him
on the cell phone or his home.

789
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:17,370
I don't give a fuck
where he is.
Just call him.

790
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,579
<i>Okay, okay.</i> Scusi.
<i>I find him.</i>

791
01:04:23,411 --> 01:04:25,068
<i>Si?</i> Inspector Lavazzi?

792
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:27,380
<i>Yes.</i> LUCAS:
<i>I'm Detective Lucas Boyd.</i>

793
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,589
<i>I'm investigating a murder
of two children.</i>

794
01:04:30,728 --> 01:04:33,110
Um, one of the suspects
that we're looking for

795
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,872
is a man by the name of
M'Gushu Randoku.

796
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:39,841
<i>He's killed two children
here in America.</i>

797
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:43,120
The interesting thing
is we found your card
at his apartment.

798
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,708
Is there
a reason for that?

799
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,193
He was kidnapping young women
all throughout Europe.

800
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:48,885
<i>Whoa, what'd you say?</i>

801
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:54,891
He was kidnapping young women
all throughout Europe, Detective.

802
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,445
I almost caught him
here in Rome a few weeks ago.

803
01:04:57,445 --> 01:04:59,757
But the son of a bitch
got away.

804
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:01,311
Okay, well, is there anything
you can help me with?

805
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:02,829
Because he's doing
the same thing here.

806
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:04,003
I know who he works for.

807
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:05,487
<i>Who?</i>

808
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:07,558
I can't prove it.
I know it as a cop.

809
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,011
Yeah, okay, well,
just talk to me
like a cop then.

810
01:05:12,011 --> 01:05:14,876
We found some CCTV footage
of Randoku meeting

811
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:16,533
with a South African businessman.

812
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,501
I later found out
his identity.

813
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,572
His name is Shelby Farner.

814
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:24,334
<i>F-A-R-N-E-R.</i>

815
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,129
<i>Farner.</i>

816
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:27,164
I appreciate it.

817
01:05:28,027 --> 01:05:30,029
Thank you.

818
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,102
<i>Prego,</i> Detective. <i>Prego.</i>

819
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:01,958
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm Detective Boyd.

820
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,269
Is Shelby Farner around?

821
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:04,339
Yes, he is.

822
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:06,341
Go get him for me, please.
- All right.
- Okay.

823
01:06:21,908 --> 01:06:23,945
Mr. Farner?
- Yes.

824
01:06:23,945 --> 01:06:25,809
Detective Boyd.
Do you mind if
we have a word?

825
01:06:26,499 --> 01:06:27,811
Certainly. Uh...

826
01:06:27,811 --> 01:06:29,537
- Come with me.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

827
01:06:31,815 --> 01:06:35,784
- What are you doing?
- You touch another
fucking kid in my city,

828
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:37,683
and I'm gonna fucking
put a bullet in your head.

829
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:40,513
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna put
a fucking bullet in your head.

830
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:43,171
You hear me?

831
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:46,002
Obviously,
you don't know
who you're talking to.

832
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:50,316
You want
somebody strong?

833
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:52,146
You want somebody strong,
you come get me.

834
01:06:52,905 --> 01:06:53,906
I'm right here.

835
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:56,357
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something.

836
01:06:56,357 --> 01:06:58,497
After I get
your fucking partner,

837
01:06:58,497 --> 01:07:00,602
I'm coming after you.
And you know
what I'm gonna do?

838
01:07:00,602 --> 01:07:02,604
I'm gonna fucking
eat your liver.

839
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:00,283
Exactly, yeah.

840
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:07,255
All right, ladies.
Time to get ready.

841
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,602
Get on your numbers.
Warm up.

842
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:11,432
Ladies on the sideline,
warm up.

843
01:08:18,611 --> 01:08:19,612
Set!

844
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:35,525
Whoo!

845
01:08:36,629 --> 01:08:38,597
- Good job, good job!
- Thank you.

846
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:40,323
Whoo!

847
01:08:40,323 --> 01:08:41,669
Good job. High five!

848
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:44,775
Good job.
Awesome.

849
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:00,722
Hello.

850
01:09:02,517 --> 01:09:04,726
I just got threatened
by Mr. Randoku.

851
01:09:06,072 --> 01:09:07,867
I'm sorry to hear that,
Dr. Mackles.

852
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,421
I'm not sorry.

853
01:09:10,801 --> 01:09:12,734
Fuck him.

854
01:09:12,734 --> 01:09:14,564
<i>Pick me up.</i> I'll be right there, yeah.

855
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:19,810
I hear you're quite
the student athlete.

856
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,260
I try my best, sir.

857
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,951
Do you know that I have
a foundation

858
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:26,403
Really?that offers scholarships
for girls like you?

859
01:09:26,403 --> 01:09:27,853
Well, do you
enjoy competition?

860
01:09:27,853 --> 01:09:29,579
- Oh, yeah.
- Always?

861
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:32,202
Yeah, I mean,

862
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:35,171
our coach tells us
that winning isn't everything,

863
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,863
but that giving it your best
is what it's all about.

864
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,038
What's the point of
putting in all that work

865
01:09:41,038 --> 01:09:43,489
if you're not
trying to win?

866
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:45,905
Ah, Katie,
you are just delightful.

867
01:09:45,905 --> 01:09:48,908
I'll bet you're
a straight A student.

868
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:51,290
- Yes, sir. Straight A's.
- Delightful.

869
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,776
And your favorite
subject is...

870
01:09:54,776 --> 01:09:56,778
A tie between
math and science.

871
01:09:58,504 --> 01:10:00,610
But I love music, too.

872
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:04,165
And math is obviously
a big part of music, so...

873
01:10:04,165 --> 01:10:05,270
Obviously.

874
01:10:07,272 --> 01:10:09,584
So, how do you know
my parents?

875
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:10,999
Oh, we've known
each other for ages.

876
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,209
So weird.

877
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,038
They never
mentioned you before.

878
01:10:15,038 --> 01:10:16,902
Well, I find
that difficult to believe.

879
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:18,593
- They really haven't.
- Oh, come on!

880
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:19,732
Really.

881
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:25,428
Ah, Katie.
I can't tell you how
perfect you are.

882
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,223
Thank you!

883
01:10:29,846 --> 01:10:30,847
Let's get Katie ready.

884
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:34,816
Ready for what?

885
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:35,955
Oh...

886
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:39,235
It's a surprise.

887
01:11:03,328 --> 01:11:04,881
<i>Her name's Katie.</i>

888
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:06,123
How are they
dealing with it?

889
01:11:06,123 --> 01:11:07,642
Well, usual.
Fed playbook.

890
01:11:08,643 --> 01:11:10,058
- No calls.
- Mm-hmm.

891
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:11,163
No ransom demand.

892
01:11:12,544 --> 01:11:13,959
I need to tell them
about Randoku.

893
01:11:13,959 --> 01:11:16,306
Yeah. Well,
when you do,

894
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:17,756
just take them
into the other room,
all right?

895
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,278
It's him.

896
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:23,762
Yeah, I know.

897
01:11:26,627 --> 01:11:28,594
Can I make
- a suggestion?
- Sure, yeah.

898
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,289
If he is working
for Farner... Mm-hmm.

899
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,464
...they're gonna want
to do the ceremony
at a very safe place.

900
01:11:38,121 --> 01:11:42,298
So I would look
for properties
owned by Farner.

901
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,474
Especially
warehouse-type
near water.

902
01:11:46,474 --> 01:11:47,475
Mmm.

903
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,761
Give me some good news, Claussen.

904
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:00,350
Farner Industries owns
a lot of property in town.

905
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,834
They got one warehouse
by the river.

906
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:03,249
I'm sending you
the address now.

907
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:05,182
Got it. Thanks.

908
01:12:27,204 --> 01:12:28,344
You gotta stay here.

909
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,345
Okay.

910
01:13:12,974 --> 01:13:15,425
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

911
01:13:16,288 --> 01:13:19,049
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

912
01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:22,674
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

913
01:13:24,469 --> 01:13:27,403
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

914
01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:30,509
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

915
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:35,031
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

916
01:13:36,826 --> 01:13:38,828
<i>Humu kuwa tani.</i>

917
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:43,073
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

918
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,627
Please stop!

919
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:46,491
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

920
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:51,012
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

921
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:52,151
No.

922
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,879
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

923
01:13:57,294 --> 01:13:59,918
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

924
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:02,610
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

925
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,025
Drop the fucking knife!

926
01:14:04,854 --> 01:14:06,165
Do it now!

927
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:10,031
Do it now
or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

928
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:14,104
Good.

929
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:16,452
Now put your hands
behind your head.

930
01:14:18,074 --> 01:14:19,351
No!

931
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:20,939
Give up!

932
01:14:52,798 --> 01:14:54,766
I warned you.

933
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:30,249
No.

934
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,810
No.

935
01:15:40,743 --> 01:15:42,503
Please, no.

936
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,022
No.

937
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:02,454
No.

938
01:16:36,799 --> 01:16:38,076
Who's there?

939
01:16:38,076 --> 01:16:39,111
Detective Boyd.

940
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:53,436
One white male
found dead on site.

941
01:16:53,436 --> 01:16:54,575
Shelby Farner.

942
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:00,477
No trace of Randoku.

943
01:17:15,285 --> 01:17:16,666
<i>Detective Boyd.</i>

944
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,357
This is Inspector Lavazzi.

945
01:17:18,357 --> 01:17:19,980
<i>Inspector Lavazzi.</i>

946
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,016
I found something
that might be helpful.

947
01:17:22,016 --> 01:17:23,224
What?

948
01:17:23,224 --> 01:17:25,261
<i>Randoku was here
in Rome</i>

949
01:17:25,261 --> 01:17:27,988
<i>attending a lecture
from someone from your city.</i>

950
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:31,992
A college professor
by the name of Mackles.

951
01:17:33,338 --> 01:17:36,203
All of this happened
nine months ago.

952
01:17:36,203 --> 01:17:38,964
<i>They also met several times
- after the lecture.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

953
01:17:38,964 --> 01:17:40,000
Right.

954
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,761
Maybe this can
help you somehow.

955
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,660
I appreciate the call.

956
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:18,245
Aw, man.

957
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:20,488
God damn it.

958
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:26,460
All right.

959
01:18:29,152 --> 01:18:31,189
Detective?
- Mmm, yeah.

960
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:33,536
Detective?
Are you okay?

961
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:37,782
She was my partner.

962
01:18:37,782 --> 01:18:39,611
It's all right.
She's been transferred.

963
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:43,063
What did you say?

964
01:18:43,063 --> 01:18:44,789
It's okay.
She's okay.

965
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:47,515
I had her moved
- downstairs.
- No, no. What do you mean?

966
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:50,208
It's okay.
I had her moved
downstairs, Detective.

967
01:18:53,349 --> 01:18:54,626
Oh, Jesus.

968
01:18:54,626 --> 01:18:56,248
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

969
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:59,320
- Oh, thank you.
- You know, every once
in a while, there's a miracle.

970
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:03,773
I guess so. Yeah.

971
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:06,742
You know, a friend
of hers came by last night
and stayed for about an hour.

972
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:07,984
And then I saw him leave.

973
01:19:11,401 --> 01:19:12,851
What do you mean?
What did he look like?

974
01:19:12,851 --> 01:19:15,474
Um, he was a tall,
greying black man.

975
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:17,062
Probably about 70s.

976
01:19:17,062 --> 01:19:18,581
With very kind eyes.

977
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:21,791
I think he prayed over her,
and then I saw him leave.

978
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:24,725
What did he say?

979
01:19:24,725 --> 01:19:26,900
He just said
she was going
to be all right.

980
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,316
And then he said a word
I didn't understand.

981
01:19:29,316 --> 01:19:30,524
Yeah, what was that?

982
01:19:30,524 --> 01:19:31,559
<i>Muti?</i>

983
01:19:33,389 --> 01:19:34,631
- I don't know.
- Thank you for
saving her, Doctor.

984
01:19:34,631 --> 01:19:36,841
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

985
01:19:36,841 --> 01:19:37,842
You bet.

986
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:08,182
<i>Hello, you've reached
Dr. Mackles office.</i>

987
01:20:08,182 --> 01:20:11,323
<i>Dr. Mackles is on extended
leave until further notice.</i>

988
01:20:11,323 --> 01:20:12,531
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

989
01:20:15,327 --> 01:20:16,328
Well played.

990
01:20:59,475 --> 01:21:01,235
You're a fucking
piece of work, Lucas.

991
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:05,826
<i>You're fucking...</i> LUCAS: <i>We're not doing this.</i>

992
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:07,932
<i>We're not doing this again?
We're not doing this again?</i>

993
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:10,969
You know what
you're not gonna do it?
You fell asleep again!

994
01:21:10,969 --> 01:21:16,561
You know our daughter
has fucking seizures,
and you fell asleep!

995
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:17,631
<i>What do I want?</i>

996
01:21:18,839 --> 01:21:19,875
<i>Fucking piece of...</i> LUCAS: <i>Come on.</i>

997
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,738
- Son of a bitch!
Come on, come on.

998
01:21:31,645 --> 01:21:32,749
I'm sorry.

999
01:21:32,749 --> 01:21:34,475
That's right,
- I'm fucking done!
- Go upstairs!

1000
01:21:37,168 --> 01:21:41,241
<i>She was
the only thing in this
whole sick fucking world</i>

1001
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:44,830
<i>that was any good
and you took her away from me!</i>

1002
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:56,601
Deelie.

1003
01:21:58,223 --> 01:21:59,293
Deelie!

1004
01:22:02,124 --> 01:22:03,090
Deelie!

1005
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,577
I'm really sorry
for what I did.
