1
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,590
上
Now.

2
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,640
出什么事了？不要！不要！
What's happening? Please! No! No!

3
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,410
不要！求你了！别开枪！
No! Please! No!

4
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,230
他不是墨索里尼！
That's not Mussolini.

5
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,170
不,不,他已经不在这里了！
No, no. Il Duce is not here anymore.

6
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,210
他今早跟上校一起走了。他现在不在这里
He left this morning with colonel. He's not here now.

7
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,500
我对天发誓！
I swear to God.

8
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,970
小姐,你最好穿上衣服
Look, signorina, you better put some clothes on.

9
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,710
几分钟后游击队马上就来镇上了...
This village is gonna be full of partisans in a minute...

10
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,820
...他们会来收集情报什么的
...and they'll be looking for information or something.

11
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,680
敬富兰克林.罗斯福
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

12
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,780
温斯顿.丘吉尔
Winston Spenser Churchill.

13
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,930
早上好,少校！将军正在等你
Good morning, major. The general's expecting you.

14
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,430
谢谢！
Thank you.

15
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,960
莱特少校
Now then, Major Wright.

16
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,730
- 我跟你说说我的主意吧  - 我能拒绝吗？
- Let me tell you what I got in mind.   - Suppose I said no?

17
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,440
我没听错吧,少校？
Did I hear you right, major?

18
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,400
少来吧,山姆
Come on, Sam.

19
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,910
我带两打人去执行过两次任务
I've taken two dozen men on two missions.

20
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,210
活着回来的没几个
Except for a couple of them, they're all dead.

21
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,180
是的,要不他们现在也早被绞死了
Yes, and most of them would have been hung by now anyway.

22
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,720
有些人现在应该活着的
A few of them would still be alive.

23
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,920
先生,你要敢违抗拒军令,就得上军事法庭
Mister, you refuse an order, you face court-martial.

24
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,930
如果军事法庭判你有罪,你就得在监狱等着战争结束吧
Court-martial finds you guilty and you'll finish the war in a military prison.

25
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,060
欧洲战场上的大半军官...
Half the officers in the European theater...

26
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,700
...都觉得你早该进监狱了
...think you belong there anyway.

27
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,130
是,也许他们是对的
Well, maybe they're right.

28
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,940
这张素描不错,将军！你画的？
That's a nice sketch, general. Your work?

29
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,130
- 是的  - 真漂亮,将军！
- Well, yes.   - That's a beautiful sketch, general.

30
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,910
这是上周我在一份德国秘密文件上看到的
It's my rendering of a secret German document I saw last week.

31
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,640
- 你知道画的是什么吗？ - V2火箭吗？
- Do you know what it is?   - V2 rocket?

32
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,310
比V2火箭还要厉害的东西
A much more powerful version than that.

33
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,850
当德国人让这玩意上天的时候...
When the Germans make that baby operational...

34
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,920
...纽约、华盛顿、莫斯科都在它的射程内
...it can reach New York, Washington, Moscow.

35
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,620
这是A4导弹！
It's an A4 missile.

36
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,890
德国人30年代中期就开始研究这种武器
The Germans were working on something like this in the mid-'30s.

37
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,930
如果他们在这次大战中及时研制成功的话,...
If they made it operational in time for this war...

38
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,630
...他们也许已经赢得了这场战争的胜利
...they probably would have won it already.

39
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,330
哦,我会把素描给盟军参谋们看
Well, I'll pass that along to the Allied General Staff.

40
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,310
假如有枚满载毒气的导弹在华盛顿引爆...
Supposing I'd painted a picture of a missile landing in Washington...

41
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,940
...结果会是一幅怎样的画面？
...and what the results would be if it were crammed full of poison gas?

42
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,320
- 德国人不会使用毒气的,先生  - 希特勒已经狗急跳墙
- The Germans will never use gas, sir.   - Hitler's desperate.

43
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,320
他会找到速战速决的方法
He's gotta find a means of achieving a quick victory.

44
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,890
牵制美军和英军...
One that'll knock the Americans and the British out...

45
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,260
...然后乘机将苏军击退
...and give him a chance to wipe out the Russians.

46
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,830
我不跟你解释盟军的宏伟策略了...
I'm not gonna explain Allied grand strategy to you...

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,330
除非在法国一个修道院里...
...except that there are three dozen canisters...

48
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,340
...有36罐正处于试验阶段的致命神经毒气
...of an experimental but deadly nerve gas in a monastery in France.

49
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,740
我们得在德军将其放入导弹前...
We want them taken out...

50
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,640
...把它们给引爆
...before they can be launched by those new rockets.

51
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,110
现在就得采取行动.
Now.

52
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,180
- 出动空军吧  - 不行
- Use the Air Force.   - No, we can't.

53
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,440
他们在占领区抓了六名科学家...
There are six scientists, top experts in chemical warfare...

54
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,640
...都是化学武器的顶级专家
...brought in from the occupied countries.

55
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,720
我们得想办法把他们救出来
We want them rescued from that monastery.

56
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,550
你去把他们从法国救出来！
You'll bring them out of France.

57
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,720
不,你找错人了,将军
No, you got the wrong man, general.

58
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,490
你知道的,我从没有执行过救援任务
You know, I'm not on any rescue mission.

59
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,190
你去找找国际红十字会的电话吧
Get the phone number of the International Red Cross.

60
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,770
现在,先生,你再去一次福布斯路的军人监狱
Right now, mister, you're on your way to Forbes Road military prison again.

61
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,530
我的意见是：你再招募另一打脏鬼
My idea is that you start finding another Dirty Dozen.

62
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,270
当然,这也许不是你的想法
Of course, that may not be your idea at all.

63
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,240
- 那么,我觉得..  - 就这么定了,少校
- Well, I was thinking...   - Nothing further at this time, major.

64
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,010
遵命,长官
Yes, sir.

65
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,680
此人叫约瑟夫.史坦,少校
Got Joseph Stern here, major.

66
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,740
判处绞刑
Death by hanging.

67
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,020
你的履历很有趣,史坦
Interesting record, Stern.

68
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,560
简洁明了,不过很有趣
I mean, brief, but interesting.

69
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,160
就你那点事情,少校,我足以胜任
For what you want done, major, I qualify.

70
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,660
哦,那是理所当然
Oh, there's no doubt about that.

71
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,770
来看看,出生在德国,1935年来到美国
Let's see, born in Germany, came to the United States in 1935.

72
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,060
1937年回到欧洲,西班牙
In '37 went back to Europe. Spain.

73
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,600
17岁时你就跟王党们并肩战斗了？
Fought on the Loyalist side when you were only 17 years old?

74
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,610
我当时谎报了年龄
I lied about my age.

75
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,370
在美国三次持枪抢劫,但没定罪
Three armed robberies back in the United States. No convictions.

76
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,570
触犯联邦法律,持枪逃窜
A federal rap, gun running.

77
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,480
这点你得承认吧
And you beat that one too.

78
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,080
是,我逃跑时很走运
Yeah, I've been running in luck.

79
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,450
是啊,你得好运到头了,最终被捕归案
Yeah, well, your luck ran out. They finally nailed you.

80
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,760
你在酒吧喝酒时还杀了两个英国人
Drunk in a bar and killed an Englishman.

81
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,190
你想因此被绞死？
You want to hang for that?

82
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,760
- 不想  - 那好吧
- No.   - All right.

83
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,060
让我们瞧瞧,你会说德语,会使用武器
Let's see, you speak German, you handle a weapon.

84
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,630
问题是,我们是团队行动
You know, my problem is I gotta put a team together.

85
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,400
根据你的履历,你向来是独来独往
And according to this, you never played on any team except your own.

86
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,470
听着,少校,你谈论的可不是打棒球
Look, major, this isn't a baseball game you're talking about.

87
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
你谈的可是场战争
You're talking about war.

88
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,970
你想去柏林再平安回来
You want to go all the way to Berlin and back.

89
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,210
如果这是逃避绞刑的唯一办法...
If it's the only way I can beat the noose...

90
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,610
...我就跟你去
...I'll follow you.

91
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,150
顺便说一下...
Just for the record...

92
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,850
...我当时在酒吧没有喝醉
...I wasn't drunk in that bar.

93
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,810
- 打开吧  - 好了,瑞典小子
- All right, open up.   - Okay, Swede.

94
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,950
把桶提出来
Bring out the bucket.

95
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,630
埃里克.沃伦,绞刑犯
Eric Wallen, death by hanging.

96
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,460
现在就准备绞死我吗？
They going to hang me now?

97
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,900
不,还没到时候
No, no, no, not now.

98
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,040
也许等会,但现在不用
Maybe later, but not now.

99
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,040
- 你被关禁闭多久？ - 我记不清了
- How long you been in solitary?   - I'm not sure.

100
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,370
他已经被关了25天,少校
He's been in solitary 25 days, major.

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,180
哦,那他们为何要关你禁闭,瑞典小子？
And what did they send you to solitary for, Swede?

102
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,550
他们想杀了我
They tried to kill me.

103
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,350
他拒绝接受常规白喉疫苗接种,少校
He refused a routine diphtheria inoculation, major.

104
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,620
医生要求他接种...
The doctor ordered it...

105
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,560
...结果他把医生和另三个狱警都打伤送医院了
...and he put the doctor and three MPs in the hospital.

106
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,350
干得不赖嘛
That's an impressive performance.

107
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,090
来看看,你因为杀了两个英国人而来此地
Let's see, you killed two British citizens to get here in the first place.

108
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,900
他们也想杀你吗？
They try to kill you too?

109
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,000
他们想抢我的钱
They tried to take my money.

110
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,570
哦,这是他们最糟糕的想法
Oh, that's the last bad idea they ever had.

111
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,610
根据法医的报告...
According to the medical examiner's report...

112
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,870
...你赤手空拳就把他们的头给打碎了？
...you crushed their heads with your bare hands?

113
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,440
我现在觉得很抱歉
I'm sorry about that now.

114
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,180
你不想从这禁闭室出去吗,瑞典小子？
How'd you like to get out of solitary, Swede?

115
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,620
- 我要被绞死了,长官  - 有可能
- They're going to hang me, sir.   - Probably.

116
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,490
但也可能不用
But maybe not.

117
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,960
想不想在死前掐死几个德国人？
Would you like one last crack at the Germans first?

118
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,360
能告诉我你的姓名吗,长官？
Could you tell me your name, sir?

119
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,190
莱特少校。记住了,大兵？
Major Wright. And you remember that, soldier!

120
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,100
因为从现在起...
Because from here on in...

121
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,970
...我就是你生命中至关重要的人
...I don't think there's anyone else who will be all that important to you.

122
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,080
今晚我们开会有几个原因
I brought you together tonight for a number of reasons.

123
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,380
其中之一是观看英国情报部门...
One of them is to view some secret footage...

124
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,750
...在德国的内线获得的...
...made available to British Intelligence...

125
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,790
...秘密胶片
...by sources inside Germany.

126
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,030
请关灯
Lights, please.

127
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,900
这部影片是在纳粹实验部门管理的...
The locale of this film is a small hospital...

128
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,800
...一个小医院里拍摄的
...maintained by SS experimental units near Schierling.

129
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,840
据悉,不到两个月前希特勒...
Our information is that this film was shown to Adolf Hitler...

130
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,110
...和他的部长阿尔伯特.施佩尔...
...and his production genius, Reichsminister Albert Speer...

131
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,680
...观看了此片
...less than two months ago.

132
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,020
她吸入了少量的神经性毒气...
She is being given a small dosage of a new nerve gas...

133
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,320
...此毒气是法国纳粹占领区的科学家研制的
...developed by scientists working in France under SS control.

134
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,510
现在毒气量在加大
More gas is pumped into the room.

135
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,410
她的肺部因吸入毒气而衰竭
By now, her lungs are collapsed by the gas.

136
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,890
心跳开始减弱
Her heart has slowed.

137
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,290
脑部陷于瘫痪
Her brain is paralyzed.

138
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,020
她死了
And she's dead.

139
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,990
请开灯
Lights, please.

140
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,230
山姆,你觉得在德军开始使用此武器前...
Sam, how much time do you think we have...

141
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,900
...我们还有多少时间？
...before the Germans start using this stuff?

142
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,870
没多少时间了
Not much.

143
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,520
英国情报部门已经确认...
British Intelligence is convinced...

144
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,480
...德军马上将用V2火箭把此种毒气...
...that canisters of this gas can shortly be delivered...

145
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,650
...发射到英国的群岛上去...
...to every part of the British Isles by V2 rocket...

146
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,360
...这样德军就不会牺牲一兵一卒了
...without the loss of a single German life.

147
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,790
先生们,你们想想
Think about it, gentlemen.

148
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,400
你全是为了我好吗,将军？
All that for my benefit, general?

149
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,670
你不是开玩笑吧
You have to be kidding.

150
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,970
有效果吗？
Did it work?

151
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,410
差不多
More or less.

152
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,480
你知道,我不是美军的忠实拥护者...
You know, I'm not that fond of the Army...

153
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,240
...但是看过纳粹的实验片后...
...but after watching those Nazi training films...

154
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,350
...我对那帮畜生越发恨之入骨
...I realize I hate those bastards even more.

155
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,350
圣米歇尔的圣佛朗西斯修道院
The Abbey of St. Francis of St. Michel.

156
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,150
毒气就在那里
That's where it's at.

157
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,160
这是圣器室,这是纳粹总部
The sacristy, SS quarters.

158
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,130
科学家就被关在老修道院的宿舍里...
The scientists are being held in the old monk's quarters...

159
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,460
...毒气弹就在地窖里
...and the canisters are in the wine cellar.

160
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,430
这是你的任务,少校
Your orders, major.

161
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,400
你将带12个被判死刑...
You will take 12 general prisoners...

162
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,630
...或长期徒刑的犯人去执行任务
...convicted and sentenced to death or to long terms of imprisonment.

163
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,040
你要训练这些犯人使之具备相应的能力...
You will train and qualify the prisoners...

164
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,340
...再将他们秘密送到法国
...and deliver them secretly behind the lines.

165
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,250
你们要毁掉预定目标...
You will attack and destroy your assigned target...

166
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,940
...拯救六个被押科学家
...and you will free the six captive scientists.

167
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,450
如果这些囚犯触任何军规...
Any breach of security, any failure of discipline...

168
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,320
...都将被送回监狱...
...and the prisoners go right back where they came from...

169
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,430
...并且立即执行判决
...for summary execution of sentence.

170
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,590
埃内斯托.费里奇,20年苦役
Ferruci, Ernesto. Twenty years hard labor.

171
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,740
得给他好好上一课
Might add a little class to the act.

172
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,110
好了,起立
Okay, Pops, on your feet.

173
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,370
放松点,费里奇,抱歉打扰你服刑了
All right, at ease, Ferruci. Sorry to disturb your labors.

174
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,110
没关系,少校,我还有20年刑期
No problem, major. I got 20 years to finish it.

175
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,770
是嘛...
Well, if you...

176
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,680
- 你多大了？ - 44岁
- How old are you?   - Forty-four.

177
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,850
- 再说一次？ - 48岁
- Come again?   - Forty-eight?

178
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,490
堪萨斯警察局说...
Well, the Kansas City police department...

179
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,560
...你已经52了
...got you listed here for 52.

180
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,720
哦,我觉得年龄大一点参军的话...
Oh, I thought the Army might be good for my...

181
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,260
...会比较安全
...my security in my old age.

182
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,260
于是我向征兵的长官撒了谎
So I lied to the recruiting officer.

183
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,900
那是什么？是我写的诗
Yeah, what's that? I write poetry.

184
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,060
你写诗？是的
Do you? Yes.

185
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,470
那蓝色小小的...
At that little tent of blue

186
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,510
囚犯们称之为天空的地方
Which prisoners call the sky

187
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,650
这首狱中诗写得不错
That's a good piece of jailhouse poetry.

188
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,340
- 谢谢你,少校！ - 谢谢你,少校？
- Thank you, major.   - Thank you, major.

189
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,320
确实是首不错的狱中诗,是50年前...
It was a great piece of jailhouse poetry when Oscar Wilde wrote it...

190
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,620
...奥斯卡.王尔德在雷丁监狱写的
...fifty years ago in Reading Jail.

191
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,020
奥斯卡.王尔德？
Oscar Wilde?

192
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,790
难怪听起来耳熟呢
I thought it sounded kind of familiar.

193
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,290
你就靠作假来生活吧？
You really had it made, didn't you, Ernesto?

194
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,490
做假石油配给券、假食物配给券、假英镑...
With your phony gas coupons, food stamps...

195
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,640
...你一个人都可以搞一个黑市了
...counterfeit British pounds. You're a one-man black market.

196
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,170
有时候人会不顾一切的,少校
Sometimes a man gets desperate, major.

197
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,100
我遇到了一个英国女孩
I met this English girl.

198
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,470
她比我年轻25岁
She was 25 years younger than myself.

199
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,110
- 我昏头了  - 还好她不是双胞胎
- I lost my head.   - It's a good thing she wasn't twins.

200
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,650
否则我们早就战败了
We would've lost the war.

201
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,010
我不明白,费里奇
I don't know, Ferruci.

202
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,810
你是个反叛人物,小偷
You're a con man and a thief.

203
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,580
但这个任务可比坐20年牢危险多了
But where I'm going, they don't just give you 20 years.

204
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,920
你会死得很难看的
They turn you upside down and let your guts roll out.

205
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,090
我觉得你年龄大了,不适合这个任务
No. I think you're a little too old for this project.

206
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,500
我不老,我身材保持得不错
I'm not too old, major. I'm in good shape.

207
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,100
也许我可以教导你手下的新人
Maybe I can help you with some of the young kids.

208
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,070
老实说吧,少校
Honest to God, major.

209
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,000
我可不想死在铁窗里
I don't want to die behind these walls.

210
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,240
好吧,那你听着
Okay, now, you listen.

211
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,610
你若在法国再违反军规就死定了,明白吗？
You foul up one time and you die in France. You understand?

212
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,310
我不知道具体需要什么
Now, I don't know what I'm gonna need.

213
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,510
法国配给券、食物券...
French ration books, food stamps...

214
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,920
...德国身份证、工作签证、现金
...German identification cards, occupation passports, currency.

215
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,220
我要的东西都很急,而且要做得很好
But whatever I need, I need fast. And I need it perfect.

216
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,550
我明白了,长官
You got it, sir.

217
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,460
你可千万别想骗过我这个行骗老手
Never con a con man, Pops.

218
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,160
这是罗兰德.韦博和大卫.韦博
This is Webber, Ronald and David.

219
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,070
都被判30年徒刑
Thirty years imprisonment. Each.

220
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,970
我觉得该跟你俩一起谈谈了
Well, I thought I'd talk to you two boys together.

221
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,550
- 既然你们是同伙  - 我总是很照顾大卫
- Since you're partners in everything.   - I always try to look after Davie.

222
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,910
哦,那你就是老大,你可把小兄弟给害惨了
Oh, you're the one. Well, look what happened to little brother Davie.

223
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,580
你害他坐30年牢,还说在照顾他
You got him 30 years and you're still taking care of Davie.

224
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,210
- 罗兰德劝过我金盆洗手  - 显然他的说服力不够
- Ronnie's tried to talk me out of things.   - Obviously not enough, right?

225
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,620
你们本来是赛车手,看看你们沦落成什么了？
You start off as race car drivers, and you wind up as what?

226
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,560
窃车贼和杀人犯
Auto thieves and killers.

227
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,220
我问你们
Let me ask you something.

228
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,300
做这些勾当能赢得金杯吗？
Do they give gold cups for that kind of dumb?

229
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,300
好了,放松点。你们最好的成绩是哪年取得的？
All right, relax. What's the last good year, boys?

230
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,400
39年,少校
'39, major.

231
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,910
我们离开农场,驾着玛莎拉蒂3.2型去参加印地车赛
We left the farm, went up to the Indy with a 3.2 Maserati.

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,480
当时我们差不多快赢了
Man, we almost took it all.

233
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,150
后来怎么回事？没油了？
And then what happened? You run out of gas?

234
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,810
不是
Not exactly.

235
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,050
第二年我们的农场破产了,少校
We lost the farm the next year, major.

236
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,850
坏事连连,我们一无所有
One thing after another, everything went down the drain.

237
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,820
我问你们
Let me ask you something.

238
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,460
你们两个都会说德语吗？
You boys, you sprechen Sie Deutsch?

239
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,150
你是说德语？
You mean German?

240
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,460
多年前我父亲离家出走后,我就几乎没听人说过了
I hardly heard it since Daddy pulled up stakes and took off years ago.

241
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,400
好吧,你们长得像德国人
All right, you look German.

242
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,000
穿上军装...
Put a uniform on you...

243
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,660
...闭上嘴,会有怎样的效果？
...keep your mouths shut and then what happens?

244
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,900
人们肯定会以为你们来自非洲军团
People gonna think you stepped out of the Afrika Korps.

245
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,010
因此你才选上我们,少校？
Is that why you're picking us, major?

246
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,150
我选上你们是因为你们是赛车手
I'm picking you because you're drivers.

247
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,880
偷懒的话我可不放过你们
One slowdown and I'll run right over you.

248
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,510
- 是,长官  - 是,长官
- Yes, sir.   - Yes, sir.

249
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,490
你现在进入的是重犯区,少校
You are now entering maximum security, major.

250
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,590
我知道了...
I see. One....

251
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,620
方提纳的狱室与其他重犯隔了三个房间？
You keep three empty cells between Fontenac and the others?

252
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,060
是的,少校,这是为了防止行刑前...
Right, major. The idea is to prevent the others...

253
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,700
...有人接近他
...from getting to him before we hang him.

254
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,130
我这次挑的人可真不错呐,嗯哼？
Well, I really picked some beauties this time, huh?

255
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,170
少校心里应该有数
I'm sure the major nows what he's doing.

256
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,280
但愿如此,中士
I hope you're right, sergeant.

257
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,250
西蒙斯！
Simmons!

258
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,400
你敢轻举妄动我就打爆你的头
You move an eyelash and I'll blow your head off.

259
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,320
你可以把他从名单上划掉了,少校
You can scratch him off the list, major.

260
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,510
我们会以越狱罪把他除名
And we'll hang him for escape.

261
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
别碰他一根汗毛
Don't touch him.

262
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,800
他是个绝佳的人选
He's perfect.

263
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,100
对！
Yeah!

264
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,200
刺！
Lunge!

265
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,140
刺！
Lunge!

266
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,480
左闪！
Left parry!

267
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,650
右闪！左闪！
Right parry! Left parry!

268
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,250
你就这点能耐吗,马丁内兹？
Best you got, Martinez?

269
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,190
- 刺！ - 来啊
- Lunge!   - Come on.

270
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,830
- 左闪！ - 来啊
- Left parry!   - Come on.

271
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,120
- 快来  - 右闪！
- Let's do it.   - Right parry!

272
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,230
- 刺中你了  - 刺！
- I got you.   - Lunge.

273
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,790
右闪
Right parry.

274
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,940
- 来吧  - 大声点
- Come on.   - I can't hear you.

275
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,560
快刺
Now lunge.

276
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,070
好了,归队,归队
All right, recover. Recover.

277
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,970
我很惊讶
I'm surprised.

278
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,010
你们大多数都是死囚吧？
I mean, most of you are in here for capital offenses, right?

279
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,710
但你们看上去就像群没杀过人的傻子
It looks like the only thing you've ever killed is time.

280
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,860
上刺刀。德军出现时你们怎么办？
Put that on. So, what are you gonna do when the Krauts show up?

281
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,790
把法庭判决书念给他们听？
Read them your trial transcripts?

282
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,790
你,瑞典小子
You, Swede.

283
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,690
接着
Catch.

284
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,790
拿住,它又不会咬你
Hold onto it, it won't bite.

285
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,560
我是你的敌人
I'm the enemy.

286
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,700
你跟我单挑
It's you and me.

287
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,270
来吧,刺我
Go ahead, lunge.

288
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,770
少校,我会杀了你的
Major, I'll kill you.

289
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,380
史上有两次大的战争
There have been two great wars.

290
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,340
瑞典两次都幸免于战
Sweden has managed to stay out of both.

291
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,810
逃过了一战和二战的硝烟,原因是什么
World War I and World War ll. I wonder why.

292
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,680
因为你们是热爱和平、聪明过人的民族？
Is it because you're a peace-loving, intelligent people?

293
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,480
- 还是因为你们是懦夫？ - 少校,别这样
- Or is it because you're cowards?   - Major, don't.

294
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,130
- 别激怒我  - 我是在激怒你,瑞典小子...
- Don't push me.   - I'm pushing you, Swede...

295
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,320
...因为我想知道你究竟是什么种？
...because I want to find out where you're coming from, all right?

296
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,560
你到底是战士...
Now, are you a soldier...

297
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,060
- ...还是孬种？ - 瑞典小子,杀了他
- ... or are you a coward?   - Kill him, Swede.

298
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,070
- 上啊,瑞典小子  - 刺死他
- Come on, Swede.   - Stick him, Swede.

299
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,570
- 把他干掉  - 杀了他
- Put him away, Swede.   - Get him, Swede.

300
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,000
少校,别说了！
Major, cut it out!

301
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,870
我们都想知道
They want to know.

302
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,170
你是男子汉还是懦夫？刺吧
Are you a man or a gutless punk? Lunge.

303
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,990
要是德军把刀插到你的后脑上...
What happens when the Kraut comes along...

304
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,420
...你会怎样？
...and shoves this steel through to the back of your head?

305
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,660
这部分训练到此为止
That's enough for this session.

306
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,580
好了,到了,列队
Okay, okay, let's go. Line up.

307
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,650
- 快点  - 好了
- Move it.   - All right.

308
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,150
大家都下车
Everybody out of the trucks.

309
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,520
快点下来！
Fall in. Move it!

310
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,600
列好队后...
And when you're ready...

311
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,290
...报数
...count off.

312
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,360
- 1  - 2
- One.   - Two.

313
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,120
- 3  - 4
- Three.  - Four.

314
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,600
- 5  - 6
- Five.   - Six.

315
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,790
- 7  - 8
- Seven.   - Eight.

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,030
- 9  - 10
- Nine.   - Ten.

317
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,300
- 11  - 12
- Eleven.   - Twelve.

318
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,500
- 13  - 你们只有12个人...
- Thirteen.   - There'll be only 12 of you...

319
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,800
...能去执行任务
...going on the mission.

320
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,600
所以你们得记住
So be on your toes.

321
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,110
有一个人要回到监狱去
One will go back to prison.

322
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,240
实战训练课程...
The infiltration under the live ammunition course...

323
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,410
...通常保留到训练的最后一周
...is usually reserved for the last week of training.

324
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,520
但我们这个训练...
But the first week and the last week...

325
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,320
...只有一周时间
...are one and the same around here.

326
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,990
此外,我希望用真枪实弹快速决定人选
And besides, I want a fast rundown on you people under fire.

327
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,120
场地那端有挺.30口径的机关枪...
The 30-caliber machine gun at the other end of the field...

328
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,570
...将会从距地面36英寸高的地方扫射
...is locked in to fire at 36 inches above the ground.

329
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,070
相当于3英尺
That's three feet.

330
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,900
仔细听着
Listen carefully.

331
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,240
把你们的头埋低
Keep your heads down.

332
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,180
把屁股紧贴在地面
And you keep your butts close to the ground.

333
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,840
这样就很容易通过了
Then you should get through it easily.

334
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,950
如果你们惊慌失措...
But if you panic...

335
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,490
...就别想参加这个任务了
...then this mission is all over for you.

336
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,450
好了,趴下
All right, hit the ground.

337
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,850
一次两人！
Two at a time!

338
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,250
我受不了了
I can't do this.

339
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,990
- 我不行了  - 坚持住,哈利特
- I gotta do something.   - You keep going, Hallet.

340
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,850
- 否则我们都死定了  - 不行
- Or he'll get us all.   - No.

341
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,920
哈利特,坚持住
Hallet, keep going.

342
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,530
趴下！你要干什么？
Stay down! What are you doing?

343
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,820
哈利特
Hallet.

344
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,760
停火！
Cease fire!

345
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,070
妈的
Goddamn it.

346
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,670
他死了
He's dead.

347
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,110
现在正好12人了,少校
Now it's an even dozen, major.

348
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,310
我们的替补队员没了
You just used up your spare.

349
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,550
继续趴下前进
Get back on your bellies.

350
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,920
你们才走了一半路程
You're only halfway there.

351
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,490
继续开火
Commence fire.

352
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,310
慢点,兄弟
Take it slow, little brother.

353
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,050
少校不可能将卡车停在这里
It ain't like the major to leave trucks sitting here.

354
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,210
我跟你说,昨晚也是这样的
I'm telling you, it was the same last night.

355
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,440
你两兄弟失眠了？
You boys couldn't sleep, huh?

356
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,880
我们准备逃走
We're going out.

357
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,570
你们要把我送回监狱绞死？
You're gonna send me back to hang?

358
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,650
你跟我们一起逃跑吧
Not unless you want to come along with us.

359
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,980
是,瑞典小子,我们还留了个位置给你
Yeah, sure, Swede, we got room for one more.

360
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,810
你们别忘了...
Don't forget...

361
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,890
...只要我们中的一人犯错...
...if one of us fouls up...

362
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,990
...我们都得回监狱
...we all get it in the neck.

363
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,960
瑞典小子,你该想想自己的前途
Swede, you gotta think about yourself.

364
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,990
我正是为自己的前途考虑
That's just what I'm doing.

365
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,560
你们回营房去
You go back to the bunks.

366
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,720
你不是疯了吧,瑞典小子
You didn't have to get mad, Swede.

367
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,420
照我说的做...
Like I said...

368
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,290
...你们两兄弟快给我滚回营房去
...you boys go back to the bunks.

369
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,290
快点
Now.

370
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,080
天哪,瑞典小子,你发起火来可真够受的
Gee, Swede, I never want to be around when you lose your temper.

371
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,620
恭喜你们
Congratulations.

372
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,420
你们撑到了生存训练课了
You got as far as survival school.

373
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,650
这些弹药筒里...
These shells...

374
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,860
...装着两盎司的神经性毒气
...contain two ounces of nerve gas.

375
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,330
这种致命毒气无色无味,传播迅速
It's odorless, fast and deadly.

376
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,030
我们的任务是破坏一座修道院...
Our mission is to destroy a monastery...

377
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,230
...那里面可能布满了这样的毒气罐
...that may be crammed to the roof with canisters of this stuff.

378
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,540
你之前没说过这些,少校
You didn't tell us about this,major.

379
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,910
现在要预先给你们上一堂课...
Now, you've been given preliminary instructions...

380
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,170
...介绍如何使用防毒面具
...as regards the use of the gas mask.

381
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,050
毒气弹爆炸后,你们要在三秒内戴上防毒面具...
When that weapon is fired, you get that mask on in three seconds flat...

382
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,690
...否则小命难保
...or we'll be burying some of you.

383
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,080
准备,引爆！
Ready, fire!

384
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,130
- 把他带到室外去！ - 让他吸点新鲜空气！
- Get him in the air!   - Get him breathing again!

385
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,140
把他放下来
Put him down.

386
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
加油,挺住！
Come on, come on, you'll make it!

387
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,080
他根本不知道怎么用面具
He didn't know what the hell to do with that mask.

388
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,520
现在你们其他人都知道了
But now the rest of you do.

389
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,850
你用不着杀死费里奇来教我们,少校
You didn't have to kill Ferruci to make your point, major.

390
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,460
好了,我骗你们的。里面装的气体...
Oh, well, all right, so I lied. The gas in those shells...

391
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,030
...只会使人暂时...
...aside from rendering the victim temporarily unconscious...

392
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,760
...丧失知觉
...has no lasting effect.

393
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,140
欢迎归队,费里奇
You can rejoin your buddies, Ferruci.

394
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,880
欢迎参加二次世界大战
Welcome to World War ll.

395
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,480
欢迎回来,马克
Welcome back, Mark.

396
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,180
- 伦敦情况怎样？ - 这个月有点冷
- How was London?   - A little chilly this month.

397
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,160
见到你真好,保罗
Good to see you again, Paul.

398
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,960
把降落伞处理掉,然后我们就走
Let's get rid of this, then we're on our way.

399
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,300
一切都按计划进行,保罗
Everything is going according to our plans, Paul.

400
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,570
我们挑了一队美国人,他们正在受训
A selected group of Americans is already in training.

401
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,040
你见到弗莱蒙了吗？
Have you seen Flamands again?

402
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,370
是,他们都很愿意去...
Yes, and they are eager to go...

403
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,780
...不过有个问题
...with one exception.

404
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,910
现在出了个大问题
But there are terrible problems now.

405
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,350
- 你什么意思？ - 站住！
- What are you talking about?   - Halt!

406
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,870
停火
Hold fire.

407
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,500
他就是跟你们主管联络的那个人？
Is this the man you saw talking with your distinguished project director?

408
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,570
是的,上校,就是他
Yes, colonel, I'm sure of it.

409
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,540
卡尔
Carl.

410
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,770
我要加强修道院的保护措施
I want increased protection for the abbey.

411
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,750
加强这个省的空中安全管制...
I want increased vigilance over all air traffic in this province...

412
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,750
...要特别注意单独飞行的飞机
...especially single aircraft.

413
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,390
通知党卫军
Notify the Sicherheitsdienst.

414
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,780
是,长官
Yes, sir.

415
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,450
现在他们看起来有点军人的样子了
Well, now. They're beginning to look like soldiers.

416
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,290
如果你不介意,我可不想转达你的话
If you don't mind, I won't tell them you said that, general.

417
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,800
当然,我可不想伤害他们的感情
Yeah, sure. I wouldn't want to hurt their feelings.

418
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,400
我下周送他们跳伞学校去...
I'm sending them to jump school next week and...

419
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,970
别提跳伞学校了,少校
Forget jump school, major.

420
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,770
我就是为此事来的
That's the principal reason I'm here.

421
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,740
我们不用空降到法国占领区了
There isn't gonna be any dramatic parachuting into occupied France.

422
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,580
你什么意思？他们已经...
What are you saying? These men have...

423
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,270
空降到法国的英国特工已经被纳粹逮捕...
The British agent who jumped into France was captured...

424
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,480
...并且枪毙了...
...and executed by the SS...

425
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,250
...同时遇害的还有跟他会面的法国抵抗运动领导人
...along with the French Resistance leader who met him.

426
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,290
我们内部有奸细
There's been a leak somewhere.

427
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,980
你的意思是要中止计划？
You mean the mission is cancelled?

428
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,290
不,计划照常进行
No, the mission is not cancelled.

429
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,920
但是德军在监控着圣米歇尔地区的每架飞机
But the Germans are monitoring every flight into the St. Michel area.

430
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,160
并且增加了保卫修道院的纳粹兵力
And they've increased a detachment of SS at the abbey.

431
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,500
他们察觉到了什么,我们还不清楚
They know something. We just don't know how much.

432
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,610
所以,你们要从海路去
So you'll go by sea.

433
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,140
今天晚些时候你们会收到详细的指示
You'll get the exact coordinates later today.

434
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,650
跟你们接头带你们进入修道院的...
And the code name of the French Resistance leader...

435
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,080
...法国抵抗运动领导人的代码是“玛丽”
...who'll meet you and get you into the monastery is "Marie. "

436
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,250
- 玛丽？ - 是的
- Marie?   - That's right.

437
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,880
她父亲是地下组织的领袖,被纳粹杀害了
Her father was the leader that the SS blew away.

438
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,720
我们已经尽最大努力了
That's the best we can do.

439
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,560
你想送他们回监狱绞死吗？
You want to send them back to hang?

440
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,240
快点,查科
Come on, Chacon.

441
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,230
- 不错！ - 快点,查科
- All right!   - Come on, Chacon.

442
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,670
- 快上啊  - 不错
- Go, come on.   - Yeah.

443
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,240
- 快点  - 不错
- Go, go, go.   - Yeah.

444
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,380
- 上去啊  - 再快点
- Go, go, go.   - Move over. Move over.

445
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,280
我在新奥尔良有个女人
I got a gal in New Orleans

446
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,580
她有16个孩子和一罐豆子
Sixteen kids and a can of beans

447
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,950
她5英尺7英尺高,还有双绿眼睛
Five-feet-seven and eyes of green

448
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,350
但她又丑陋又自私
But she's ugly and she's mean

449
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,580
- 大声点  - 1,2...
- Sound off   - One, two

450
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,730
- 再来一次  - 3,4...
- Hit it again   - Three, four

451
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,160
- 大声报数  - 1,2,3,4...
- Cadence count   - One, two, three, four

452
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,260
1,2,3,4...
One, two, three, four

453
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,660
我在新奥尔良有个女人
I got a gal in New Orleans

454
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,360
她有16个孩子和一罐豆子
Sixteen kids and a can of beans

455
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,940
她5英尺7英尺高,还有双绿眼睛
Five-feet-seven and eyes of green

456
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,170
这是我们的目标
The target area.

457
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,650
圣米歇尔的圣弗朗西斯修道院
The Abbey of St. Francis of St. Michel.

458
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,440
那应该是个很圣神的地方
A very holy place, I would imagine.

459
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,880
对,是个圣神的地方,凯利
Yes, it was a holy place, Kelly.

460
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,490
修道士们被派往其他同宗派的修道院去了
The monks have been sent to another monastery of the same order.

461
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,090
这座修道院在纳粹党卫军的...
This monastery is in the hands of the SS Totenkopf...

462
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,990
...“骷髅师”的掌控之中
...the Death's Head Division.

463
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,630
抵抗组织为我们查明了主要的三个区域
The Resistance has pinpointed three main areas for us.

464
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,790
用于通讯的无线电室...
The radio room to knock out communications...

465
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,960
...藏匿毒气罐的地窖...
...the wine cellars with the gas canisters...

466
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,610
...机关枪都在阳台上
...and the machine gun post on the balcony.

467
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,710
修道院的拜访者...
The traveling members of the order...

468
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,370
...仍然可以使用小礼拜堂
...are still permitted to use the chapel.

469
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,480
你就从这入手,费里奇
And that's where you come into it, Ferruci.

470
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,550
是。你需要我做什么,少校？
Yeah? What do you need, major?

471
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,210
我们需要纳粹圣米歇尔地区指挥官...
These are identification cards...

472
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,880
...签署的身份证
...issued by the SS commandant of the St. Michel area.

473
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,020
克雷格上校
A Colonel Krieger.

474
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,490
我需要两个对修道会授权...
I want two of these for the brothers of the order...

475
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,820
...进行为期两周访问的身份证
...authorizing them to travel for two weeks.

476
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,860
- 能重操旧业真是好  - 那就好
- It's sure nice to be working again.   - Oh, that's nice.

477
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,590
记得做我的身份证...
And make sure the documents identify me...

478
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,130
...还有莫瑞斯的
...and Maurice here.

479
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,530
少校,你是说你和我要溜进修道院？
Are you saying, major, that you and I are gonna go into that monastery?

480
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,040
是那么回事
Eventually.

481
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,970
修道院的地窖里有36罐毒气
There are 36 canisters in the cellar of the monastery.

482
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,610
我们要把它们炸了...
We're gonna blow them up...

483
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,050
...然后救出被关押的六位科学家
...and get out the six scientists they're holding as prisoners.

484
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,050
我们去救6个科学家？你之前说的是...
We're going in there to bring back six scientists? You told us we were...

485
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,710
- ...去那里杀德国兵的  - 放松点,史坦,会有机会的
- ... gonna get a shot at the Germans.   - Relax, Stern, that'll happen.

486
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,120
我还有个好消息告诉你们...
And I got news for you...

487
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,350
...德军也会好好瞄准我们的
...they're gonna get a good shot at us too.

488
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,000
马丁内兹,跟你在伦敦炸毁的保险箱比...
Martinez, that safe you blew up in London, a piece of cake...

489
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,070
...炸掉修道院的毒气罐易如反掌
...compared to knocking out those canisters at the monastery.

490
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,000
这项工作真是史无前例
I never did a job like this.

491
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,970
不过我应该能胜任
But maybe I can do this one.

492
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,270
哦,如果你能...
Oh, well, if you do...

493
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,670
...顺利完成任务...
...and everything goes right...

494
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,280
...你就不用在监狱里...
...then you're gonna beat the Army...

495
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,750
...蹲上50年了,你觉得如何？
...out of 50 years in military prison. How's that?

496
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,940
- 炸药怎么办？ - 炸药...
- What about the juice?   - The juice.

497
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,520
- 将由法国方面提供  - 我有个问题,少校
- The French will supply the explosives.    - Let me ask you something, major.

498
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,720
你要我们炸掉毒气罐
You say we're going to blow up the canisters of poison gas.

499
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,260
爆炸不会引起毒气扩散吗？
Won't the explosions spread the gas?

500
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,160
最佳方案是,我们使用燃烧弹...
Well, the best thinking is, that if we use incendiaries...

501
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,500
...毒气罐就在修道院地窖...
...and the canisters are in a tightly enclosed area...

502
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,610
...这个密闭的空间内爆炸...
...as they are in the cellar of the abbey...

503
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,470
...毒气处于惰性状态,就能被火焰消耗
...the gas, in its present inactive state, will be consumed by the flames.

504
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,610
如果最佳方案出错了呢？
Suppose the best thinking is wrong?

505
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,370
那么...
Then...

506
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,010
...我们都别想再弹钢琴了
...none of us will ever get to play the violin again.

507
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,520
好的,谢谢你们听我说话
Well, I thank you for your attention.

508
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,720
好了
All right.

509
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,030
你觉得呢,中士？
What do you think, sergeant?

510
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,240
我觉得他们会把你活埋在法国,少校
I think they're gonna bury you in France, major.

511
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,670
他们全都这样想
They think the same thing.

512
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
都下车,快
Everybody out. Move it.

513
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,640
大家快点,快下车
Let's go, let's go. Move it, guys.

514
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,080
听从少校指挥
You heard the major.

515
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,860
- 搞什么鬼？ - 这里不是跳伞学校
- What the hell is this?   - Don't look like a jump school to me.

516
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,650
不,好像是个港口
No, this is some kind of port.

517
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,160
也许是南安普顿
Southampton maybe.

518
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,120
或许我们能在这大干一场
Maybe we're gonna get our shots here.

519
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,930
快看哪
Look at that.

520
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,960
真不赖啊
Oh, that's nice.

521
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,870
嗨,中士,她有妹妹吗？
Hey, sarge, she got a sister?

522
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,830
好了,进去吧,快点
All right, inside. Move.

523
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,840
快点
Move it.

524
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,810
- 来吧,老波  - 别叫我老波
- Come on, move it, Pops.   - Don't call me Pops.

525
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,710
老波,别发火
Now, Pops, don't get overexcited.

526
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,180
他们来了
Well, here they are.

527
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,580
一群帅小伙
Good-looking men.

528
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,520
大洋彼岸的致命诱惑！
It's a transatlantic invasion!

529
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,220
- 你好,宝贝  - 她真是美艳绝伦
- Hello, dear.   - She's gotta be dreaming.

530
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,360
- 过来,坐我旁边  - 我好像是上了天堂
- Come here, sit next to me.   - Think I died and went to heaven.

531
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,820
我要那个魁梧的大个子
I'll have the big tall fellow.

532
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,490
真贪心
Greedy.

533
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,470
好了,这是玛莎
All right, this is Martha.

534
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,230
玛莎是这些漂亮女孩的..
Martha's the head mistress of this...

535
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,970
...妈妈桑
...very exclusive girl school.

536
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,120
玛莎说你们跟突击队一样...
Martha says you're part of a very elite unit...

537
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,020
...都是精英战士
...just like our commandos.

538
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,290
是的,没错
Yeah. That's us.

539
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,400
我们是精英战士
An elite unit.

540
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
万里挑一的
One in a million.

541
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,770
我喜欢慢舞曲
I like the slow dance numbers.

542
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,710
我喜欢快点的,但晚会是为你们开的
I prefer the fast ones, Yank, but it's your party.

543
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,350
噢,别着急,美国大兵,我是你的了
Wu,Easy does it, Yank, I'm on your side.

544
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,060
他是个强奸犯,杀死过一个陆军妇女队成员
He's a rapist and he murdered a WAC.

545
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,470
- 他应该在这里吗？ - 你们都该在这里
- You think he belongs here?   - You all belong here.

546
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,800
帮我个忙
But do me a favor.

547
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,640
帮我盯着他
Keep an eye on him anyway.

548
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,470
没问题
Consider it done.

549
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,880
- 有香烟吗？ - 有,我还有口香糖
- Got any cigs?   - Yeah, chewing gum too.

550
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,320
终于找到他们喜欢做的事情了
Finally found something they like to do.

551
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,720
若是让高层知道了怎么办,少校？
What do you think will happen when the brass finds out, major?

552
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,950
我才不管他们
Forget about the brass.

553
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,860
这些人都要去送死了
I'm getting these guys killed.

554
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,000
至少我该让他们...
The least I can do...

555
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,400
...沾上点好运
...is let them get lucky.

556
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,570
法国海岸涨潮了
The sea is full On the French coast

557
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,310
月光摇曳,瞬息即灭
The light Gleams and is gone

558
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,410
欢饮来到法国,我是玛丽.维兰尼
Welcome to France. I am Marie Verlaine.

559
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,310
我是莱特少校
I'm Major Wright.

560
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,420
我们继续行军吧
Maybe we ought to keep moving.

561
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,400
这边
This way.

562
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,750
你父亲的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your father.

563
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,010
- 他是被出卖的？ - 是的
- Was he betrayed?   - Of course.

564
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,210
之后我就没回过家
I haven't been home since.

565
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,290
进攻修道院前我们就呆在一个安全的农场
But there's a farm where we'll be safe until we hit the monastery.

566
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,190
你跟那些科学家联系上了？
You been in touch with the scientists?

567
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,450
项目主管,乔治.弗莱蒙等着见你们...
The project director, George Flamands, is waiting to see you...

568
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,720
...不过我的先跟你说一下
...but there's something you should know.

569
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,990
两周前,纳粹司令官克雷格上校觉得...
Two weeks ago, the SS Commandant Colonel Krieger...

570
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,230
...那些科学家需要一点动力...
...decided the scientists at the abbey needed better motivation...

571
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,630
...才能把工作做好
...for their work.

572
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,900
- 什么意思？ - 其中三个科学家都已结婚
- What are you talking about?   - Three of the scientists are married.

573
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,870
纳粹把他们的妻子接来了
He rounded up their wives.

574
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,600
她们不是被关在集中营吗？
Are they in a concentration camp?

575
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,410
正相反,她们就在修道院里...
On the contrary, they are at the monastery.

576
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,950
是第三帝国“尊贵的客人”
The "honored guests" of the Third Reich.

577
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,050
我不能把他们妻子接走
I didn't come to pick up husbands and wives.

578
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,520
我知道你的任务,少校
I know why you're here, major.

579
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,950
你是来炸毁修道院,消灭那里的德军
To blow up the monastery and kill the Germans working there.

580
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,420
我赞同你们的任务
I approve of that motive.

581
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,640
我们为何不能走陆路到农场？
Why can't we stay on the land until we reach this farm?

582
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,910
克雷格在每个岗哨都增加了一倍的兵力...
Krieger has doubled the security at every checkpoint...

583
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,020
...将常规军编入了纳粹党卫军
...adding regular troops to the SS.

584
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,820
德军一直都控制着水路...
The Germans are so used to controlling the river...

585
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,930
...所以他们在此比较大意
...that they've gotten careless.

586
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,090
好了,玛丽,我们上吧
All right, Marie. Let's go for it.

587
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,130
好了,你们去把无线电发报机给拿下了
All right, I'm counting on you to take out the radio.

588
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,970
趴下！
Get down!

589
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,920
斯图文特去哪了？
Where's Sturdivant?

590
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,620
他死了
He's dead.

591
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
史坦,去发报机那里
Stern, get on the radio.

592
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,120
熟悉一下此船的代号...
Familiarize yourself with the vessel's call letters...

593
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,290
...但不要发送无线电信号
...but don't attempt any transmission.

594
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,500
明白
You got it.

595
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,570
我们清理一下船只
Let's get this craft cleaned up.

596
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,010
坐一等舱,把船开到河口
We're going up the estuary. First class.

597
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,050
然后与抵抗组织联系
And make contact with the Resistance.

598
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,430
- 晚上好,玛丽  - 晚上好,弗朗索瓦
- Good evening, Marie.   - Good evening, Francois.

599
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,760
他们到了,我们接上了
They are here now. We made it.

600
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,090
- 太好了  - 是
- Very good.   - Yes.

601
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,760
嗨,这里就像我离开的那个家
Hey, this is just like home. The one I ran away from.

602
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,760
少校,为何不能喝这些法国美酒？
Major, how come we can't drink some of this fine French wine?

603
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:39,030
因为我不想有群醉鬼手下
Because I don't want a dozen winos on my hands, that's why.

604
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,140
都听好了
Now listen.

605
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,600
你们一直在这里呆到晚上九点半
You're all gonna stay down here until 21：30 hours.

606
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,110
抵抗组织会为你们放哨...
The Resistance people are gonna post guards...

607
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,080
- ..你们都呆在这里  - 那些法国姑娘呢,少校？
- ... but you all stay out of sight.   - Where are the French girls, major?

608
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,240
- 她们在英国把我们服伺的不错  - 是呀
- They did us a fine job in England.   - Yeah.

609
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,220
我只想让你们知道在为何而战
Well, I just wanted you to know what you were fighting for.

610
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,820
- 方提纳！ - 少校？
- Fontenac!   - Major?

611
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,430
我们待会去修道院
We're going to the monastery.

612
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,390
玛丽安排我们跟项目主管见面
Marie's arranged a meeting with the director of the project.

613
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,620
乔治.弗莱蒙
George Flamands.

614
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,050
- 怎么了？ - 不知道,上校
- What happened?   - We're not sure, colonel.

615
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,160
这条船昨天下午5点在SSM地区...
The boat was last in communication at Salles-sur-Mer...

616
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,850
...跟我们失去了联系
...about 5 p. m. yesterday evening.

617
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:41,300
我们派它去巡视河口和水路,一直到晚上7点
It was to patrol the estuary and the approaches until 1900 hours.

618
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,200
2分钟前我们在河口发现了船,但上面空无一人
It was found with no signs of life at the estuary about 20 minutes ago.

619
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,800
- 船员呢？ - 都不见了
- What about the crew?   - Gone.

620
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,370
前后甲板上都布满弹孔
There are many bullet holes on the forward and afterdecks.

621
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,480
通知第七军总部
Notify Army Group 7 headquarters.

622
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,940
是,长官。说是突击队袭击吗,上校？
Yes, sir. A commando attack, colonel?

623
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,020
不,这没有原由？
No. For what purpose?

624
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,620
袭击船只是有原因的
The boat was taken for a purpose.

625
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,120
当他们到达目的后...
And when that purpose was accomplished...

626
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,590
...就弃船了
...the boat was abandoned.

627
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,420
幸好我们及时发现
We're lucky we found it this fast.

628
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,730
- 船上储备的弹药呢？ - 用完了或是被偷了
- What about the reserve ammunition?   - Expended or perhaps stolen.

629
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,460
我们认为可能是当地抵抗组织干的
We thought perhaps the local Resistance.

630
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,800
当地抵抗组织可不会抽“幸运”牌香烟
The local Resistance doesn't smoke Lucky Strikes.

631
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,920
- 少校？ - 请进
- Major?   - Come in.

632
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,780
抱歉打搅你了...
I'm sorry to disturb you...

633
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,650
...不过我要跟几个今天进城的人碰头
...but I'm going to see some of the men who went into the city today.

634
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,090
好的
All right.

635
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,390
你去圣米歇尔打探情况
You go to St. Michel, find out what's happening.

636
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,930
- 然后我告知我的人  - 好的
- In the meantime, I'll brief my men.   - Good.

637
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,360
玛丽...
Marie...

638
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:53,470
...你离开法国和亲人会不会很痛苦？
...is it gonna be difficult to leave France and your family?

639
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,770
我很小的时候母亲就死了...
My mother died when I was a child...

640
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,930
...我的兄弟死在战争爆发的第一天
...and my brother was killed in the first days of the war.

641
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,110
现在我父亲也走了...
Now that my father is gone...

642
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,680
...我唯一的亲人就是抵抗组织
...the only family I have is the Resistance.

643
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,650
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

644
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,980
你知道战争是很残酷的吧,玛丽？
You really must know what war is all about, right, Marie?

645
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,980
真漂亮
Beautiful.

646
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,180
是的,不过你要小心点
Yes, but take a good look.

647
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,180
别忘了你现在是个修道士,好吧？
Now, remember, you're a monk, okay?

648
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,420
你已经发誓要虔诚、平和
You've taken vows of piety and nonviolence.

649
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,760
你要装好,否则我们就完了
You fake it good, or we're dead.

650
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,140
早上好,神父
Morning, holy Fathers.

651
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,640
- 你们来自尼姆？ - 是,我们修道会的新家
- I see you've come from Nimes.   - Yes, the new home of our order.

652
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,450
但我们希望能在这里做祷告
But we have a great desire to pray here, if we may.

653
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,250
当然,我们不会与上帝为敌
Oh, of course,are we the enemies of God?

654
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,690
你们从南希来？
Did you come by Nancy?

655
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,800
不是,我们从沙龙来
No, by way of Chalon.

656
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,130
那样不但快,而且沿途的景色也更美
It's much faster, and the scenery is much more pleasant.

657
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,660
我也这样觉得
My impression exactly.

658
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,140
谢谢你们,神父
Thank you, holy Father.

659
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,210
你刚才表现不错
You did a good job with the sentry.

660
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,040
谢谢。我以前当过祭童
Thank you. I was an altar boy.

661
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,700
我早该猜到
Of course. I should have guessed.

662
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,590
那个项目主管不会不来了吧？
Suppose your project director doesn't show up?

663
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,100
不会,他会来的
No, he'll be here.

664
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,100
听着,我们离开时...
Look, when we leave...

665
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,670
...你告诉纳粹中士我们想再来
...you tell the SS sergeant we want to return again.

666
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,500
就在今晚
Tonight.

667
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,770
我就对他说要进行晚间祷告
Could be evening prayer.

668
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,410
这对修道士非常重要
Very important for monks.

669
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,310
很好
Perfect.

670
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,020
下午好,修士们
Good afternoon, brothers.

671
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,060
我猜你们一定是走了很远的路吧？
I think you have come a very long way.

672
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,090
为了寻找上帝
In search of God.

673
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,820
我们都得经历这样的旅程
That's a journey we all must make.

674
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,800
弗莱蒙先生,我们今晚就把你们救出去
Monsieur Flamands, we're taking you out of here tonight.

675
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,440
好极了
Good.

676
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,270
我开始整理笔记...
I'll start collecting my notes...

677
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,700
...并告知小组其他成员
...and advising the other members of my group.

678
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,040
当然,副主管皮埃尔.克劳德除外
Except, of course, for my assistant director, Pierre Claudel.

679
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,610
- 为何不告诉他？ - 他是个法国纳粹
- And why not him?   - He's a French Nazi.

680
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,650
是维希人和“火十字团”的混血儿
Part of Vichy, part of the Croix de Feu.

681
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,180
也许是他害死了当地的抵抗运动领袖...
He may have caused the death of Paul Verlaine...

682
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,880
...保罗.维兰尼
...the local Resistance leader.

683
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,350
少校
Major.

684
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,590
- 那人可能会泄露我们的行动  - 他还蒙在鼓里
- That man could blow this thing open.   - He doesn't know.

685
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,420
如果他知道的话早就检举我们了
If he knew more, he would have denounced us already.

686
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,060
计划如下...
The plan.

687
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,750
我们午夜后过来
We come here after midnight.

688
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,660
炸毁目标...
We blow up our target...

689
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,700
...20分钟内把你们救出去
...and get you out in less than 20 minutes.

690
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,100
应该可行
That's possible.

691
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,100
但你们要在炸毁目标前把我们救出修道院
But you must get us out of the monastery before you blow it up.

692
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,470
- 我们会的  - 你们有足够的时间...
- We'll do that.   - You'll have plenty of time...

693
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,070
...跟你们得妻子告别
...to make sure your wives are safe and kiss them goodbye.

694
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,940
- 你在说什么？ - 弗莱蒙先生
- What are you talking about?   - Monsieur Flamands.

695
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,810
我们来的时候不知道你们家人也在
We didn't know about your families when we landed.

696
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,580
这是军事撤退
This is a military evacuation.

697
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,450
我们现在的问题是飞机位置不够
We've got a problem. We just don't have any room.

698
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,350
那怎么行
Then it's impossible.

699
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,290
难道你不知道纳粹之所以把我妻子...
Don't you realize what would happen to my wife...

700
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,690
...和其他人扣为人质...
...and other hostages...

701
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,230
...就是想以此来要挟我们？
...the Nazis could think of to threaten us with?

702
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,330
否则我们怎么会为他们做事？
Why else do you think we worked for them?

703
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,660
或许是因为你对纯科学研究感兴趣
Perhaps because of your interest in pure science.

704
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,110
我家人会挂念我的
I will be missed at my desk.

705
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:32,740
我再强调一次,如果不带上我妻子,我哪儿也不去
Make no mistake, I'm going nowhere without my wife.

706
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,780
我们也会准备好的
We will be ready in any case.

707
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,690
皮埃尔
Pierre.

708
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,430
没想到你也信奉上帝,乔治
I had no idea there was a religious streak in you, George.

709
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,300
克雷格上校要跟你通话
Colonel Krieger is on the phone.

710
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,940
谢谢
Thank you.

711
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,970
好了
All right.

712
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,870
现在,抵抗组织会开两辆车到修道院后门
Now the Resistance will have two trucks in back of the abbey.

713
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,340
要不要带他们的家眷去观光？
How about a tour bus and a guide for these husbands and wives?

714
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,810
少校,把他们都救出来太疯狂了
Major, it is crazy to go bring them out.

715
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,540
要是飞机无法起飞怎么办？
Suppose the plane won't take off?

716
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,120
放心,肯定能飞起来的
Oh, it will take off.

717
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,050
而且,飞机也不够大
Besides, the flight's not that long.

718
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,590
必要情况下,我们可以丢弃一些备用燃料
And if we have to, we'll jettison some of the reserve fuel.

719
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,420
少校,你说过此地区领空的德机占全法国德机的一半
Major,You said half the German air force in France is in this area.

720
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,530
你能带我们这些人一起逃出去吗？
You gonna outrun them with these people?

721
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,820
是的,必要时只能如此。你想想...
Yes, if I have to. Look...

722
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,400
...这些科学家不肯抛弃他们的妻子...
...the scientists won't leave without their wives...

723
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,540
...而我的任务就是带他们逃离这里
...and it's my job to get them out of here.

724
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,170
不,少校
No, major.

725
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,310
你的任务是炸毁修道院...
Your job is to knock out that monastery...

726
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,810
...让那些科学家不再为德军..
...and to keep scientists from showing the Germans...

727
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,070
...制造更多的毒气
...to make more effective poison gas.

728
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,010
你什么意思？
What the hell are you talking about?

729
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,010
让他们自己选择,少校
Give them a choice, major.

730
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,050
就像军队让我们选择一样
The same choice the Army gave us.

731
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,280
要么走,要么留
You go or you stay.

732
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,950
如果这些人不识趣,我们就干掉他们
Now if these people don't buy it, we'll stop them.

733
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,250
让他们不光没法再制造毒气...
Not only from making more gas...

734
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,790
...也没法再在其他地方建立实验室...
...but also from setting up another laboratory...

735
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,520
...代替我们炸掉的这个
...to replace the one that we're about to blow up.

736
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,930
你这是想把他们都杀了？
Are you talking about murdering them？

737
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,070
现在是战争时期,少校
We are in a war, major.

738
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,970
他们有选择的机会
They have a choice.

739
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,210
你想把我们这些人给抛下吗？
You wanna leave it up to these boys here?

740
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,820
- 要投票决定吗？ - 也许方提纳说得对,少校
- To vote on this?   - Maybe Fontenac's right, major.

741
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,960
让他们选择吧。纳粹需要的只是他们的智慧
Let them have a choice. They're the brains the Nazis need.

742
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,650
不,他说的不对！
No, he's wrong!

743
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,620
我不会把他们抛弃在那里
And I'm not leaving here without them.

744
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,600
- 玛丽,怎么了？ - 得有人去开卡车
- Yes, Marie, what is it?   - Someone men must go get the trucks.

745
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,930
其他人必须回家
Others must get back to their families.

746
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,900
纳粹党卫军在圣米歇尔挨家挨户搜查
The SS is conducting house-to-house searches in St. Michel.

747
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,910
这样看,他们肯定已经找到了巡逻船
Well, the Germans must have discovered the patrol boat.

748
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,600
或者发现船失踪了
Or they know it's missing.

749
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,870
不过德军的其他行动可能对我们有利
But they have other duties which may help us.

750
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,480
今晚本地区的新指挥官会到来
The new army general has arrived to command the region.

751
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,180
他们会在别墅为他举行欢迎仪式
There is a reception tonight for him at the villa.

752
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,590
德军高级将领都会参加吧？
And the reception will tie up the top brass, huh?

753
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,320
很好,终于找到突破口了
All right. We finally got a break.

754
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,190
如果他们款待将军的话...
If they're entertaining the general...

755
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,760
...修道院今晚的防卫也许会比较松懈
...maybe security won't be as tough at the abbey tonight. Maybe.

756
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,110
克劳德已经来了一会了
Claudel was here a moment ago.

757
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,080
- 他说我们该穿好衣服了  - 好的
- He says we have to get dressed.   - That's right.

758
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,690
新指挥官今晚想见我们
The new German commandant wants to see us tonight.

759
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,380
我们都要参加他的晚宴
We are to be his guests at dinner.

760
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,690
你不是说美军会救我们出去
You said the Americans are coming to take us out.

761
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,630
我知道,但我联系不上行动负责人
I know, but I can't contact the American officer leading the attack.

762
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,930
我不知道他会有怎样的反应
I don't know what his reaction would be if I did.

763
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,200
尤其是我全盘托出的话
Especially if I told him everything.

764
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,970
你没告诉他我们的事？
Did you tell him about us?

765
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,610
他们知道我们的妻子也在这里
He knows that there are wives.

766
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,610
其他就一无所知
He doesn't know more than that.

767
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,370
那你和我必须跟克劳德走
Then you and I must go with Claudel.

768
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,720
那个可恶的纳粹
That damn Nazi.

769
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,120
- 亲一下,爸爸  - 来吧,儿子
- A kiss, Papa.   - But of course, my son.

770
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,080
妈妈说你们要出去
Mother says you're going out.

771
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,490
是的,我们要去圣米歇尔几个小时
Yes, we have to go into St. Michel for a few hours.

772
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,260
就你妈和我去,对不起
Just your mother and I. Sorry.

773
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,370
你要我们今晚准备好的
You said we had to be ready tonight.

774
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,060
是的,孩子
That's right, my son.

775
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,930
我们要跟你分开一会儿
And you may have to go somewhere without us for a while.

776
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,070
- 就一会儿  - 你是说像去上学一样
- Just a while.   - You mean like the school?

777
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,940
是的,像去上学
Yes, like the school.

778
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,340
无论发生什么事,你都要跟你的朋友和杜弗伦博士在一起
No matter what happens, you stay with your friends and Dr. Dufresne.

779
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,710
- 明白了吗？ - 我们现在都是军人了？
- Is that clear?   - We're all soldiers now?

780
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,650
哪有那么小的军人
So young to be a soldier.

781
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,820
我的人会带你们进入修道院的地窖
My people will get you into the wine cellar of the abbey.

782
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,960
我们今晚十点离开。祝好运,少校
We leave at 10 tonight. Good luck, major.

783
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:16,460
好的,我待会布置行动计划,马丁内兹
All right, I'll lay out that plan later. Martinez.

784
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:21,630
我不小心听到你们谈话了
I couldn't help overhearing some of the conversation.

785
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,600
如果带上我会麻烦的话...
If there is a problem in taking me...

786
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,940
...我可以往南逃到西班牙
...I can head south, and then try for Spain.

787
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,080
玛丽,我会带你离开的
Marie, I'll get you out of here.

788
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,280
你想怎样,少校？
What do you want, major?

789
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,680
你想试探我们..
You trying to find out...

790
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,290
...看关键时刻谁会站在你那边？
...who's on your side if there's a showdown?

791
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,650
我可以告诉你,不会有人站在你那边
I can tell you. No one.

792
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,430
- 你呢,史坦？ - 我是来杀德国佬的
- What about you, Stern?   - I came here to kill Germans.

793
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:52,000
好了,我查过你的背景...
Okay. You know, I did a little checking into your record...

794
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,200
- 你干嘛多管闲事,少校  - ...在你受训的时候
- You should mind your own business,Major.   - ... while you were training.

795
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:56,840
你抢的三间银行都是...
Those three banks you robbed...

796
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,770
...泛德银行的支行
...all branches of Trans-German Nord.

797
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,540
那是纽约最大的德国银行
The largest German-owned trading bank in New York.

798
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,440
也许我并不知道
Maybe I didn't know that.

799
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,110
或许吧
Maybe not.

800
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,910
还有你走私的枪支
Or those guns you were arrested for smuggling.

801
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,420
我军都还没装备...
All wound up in countries...

802
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,490
...那些枪就留到抗德和抗日的...
...fighting against the Germans and the Japanese...

803
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,390
...国家去了
...even before we got into it.

804
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,390
- 我告诉过你...  - 你没有
- I told you....   - No.

805
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,230
你一个字都没跟我说过,不过我告诉你
You haven't told me a damn thing, but I'm telling you.

806
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,990
你心里想的那些...
Whatever you got up there...

807
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,500
...会把你给毁了的
...it's tearing you apart.

808
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,040
那又有什么区别？
What difference does it make?

809
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:30,330
再过几小时我们全都会送命
We're all going to be dead in a few hours.

810
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,440
史坦不是我的真名
Stern isn't my real name.

811
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,340
是带我离开德国的...
It's the name of the family...

812
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,820
...那家人的姓
...I was smuggled out of Germany to live with.

813
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,650
你的真名很重要吗？
Well, is your real name important?

814
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,020
不重要
No.

815
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:51,150
我家族人大多都死了
Most of the people who had it are probably already dead.

816
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,020
本来我们家族人丁兴旺,少校
There were literally dozens of us, major.

817
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,690
现在或许就剩我一个了
Maybe I'm the last one.

818
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:58,800
所以,那六个为纳粹做事的科学家的死活...
So those six scientists working for the Nazis...

819
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,500
...你根本就不在乎
...whether they live or die, you don't give a damn.

820
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,270
你说得没错,少校
You got it, major.

821
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,940
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

822
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,840
我也是
So am I.

823
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,570
卡尔.霍夫勒中尉
Lieutenant Karl Hoeffler.

824
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,610
他负责指挥巡逻船,上校
He commanded the patrol boat, colonel.

825
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,710
有没找到其他水手的尸体？
Any other sailors' bodies recovered yet?

826
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,810
没有。但我们知道攻击的发生地点...
No,Sir。but we know the area where the attack must have taken place...

827
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,750
...我们会继续搜寻的
...and we will continue searching.

828
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:49,720
他是为元首捐躯的
He died for his Fuhrer.

829
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,220
我们关押了多少抵抗组织的成员？
How many Resistance members do we have in detention?

830
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,620
6个,上校
Six, colonel.

831
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,590
把他们都绞死
Hang them.

832
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,660
这是帝国警察领袖希姆莱的命令
Orders of Reichsleiter Himmler.

833
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,530
发布一个报复的告示
Post a notice of retaliation.

834
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,830
告诉他们,这些人...
State that they are being executed in reprisal...

835
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,730
...要为死去的德国水手偿命
...for the murder of German sailors.

836
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,740
告诉大家,如果有人揭发真凶,我就会赦免...
State that I may spare the six if those who actually committed the murders...

837
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,640
...这六个人
...are identified.

838
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,450
玛丽和游击队员今晚跟我们在修道院北边碰头
Marie and the partisans will meet us at the north end of the monastery.

839
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,090
马丁内兹,你跟史坦取出毒气罐...
Martinez, you and Stern take out the canisters. Holt...

840
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,550
...霍特,你解决岗哨的士兵...
...you wipe out the gun tower, then get inside...

841
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,450
...溜进去炸掉它
...and blow the place to hell.

842
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,790
应该没问题
Maybe I can do this one.

843
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,020
巴勒斯和查科...
Ballews and Chacon will go and support you...

844
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,760
...从阳台上方协助你
...from the upper balconies.

845
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:39,890
你们有2分钟时间去消灭修道院的德军
You got 20 minutes to secure the monastery.

846
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,250
嗨,老波,方提纳在哪里？
Hey, Pops. Where's Fontenac?

847
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,160
他说他要去当守卫
He said he was gonna pull guard duty.

848
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:41,960
那个混蛋骗子,快！
That lying bastard. Come on!

849
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:56,510
动一下我就把你的喉咙割了
You move and I'll cut your throat out.

850
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,810
去叫少校
Get the major.

851
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,850
先让我把这个人渣解决了
After I get rid of this pig.

852
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,250
不行！
No!

853
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,710
你没权处置他,少校才有权
You don't make that decision. The major does.

854
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,320
我待会再回来
I'll be right back.

855
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,360
你真是不同凡响,莫瑞斯
Oh, you're beautiful, Maurice.

856
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,870
真是上帝的杰作
You're a real work of art.

857
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,410
究竟怎么回事？
What the hell happened?

858
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,440
我能帮什么忙吗？
Is there anything I can do to help?

859
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,240
把他们赶出去
Get them out of here.

860
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:05,010
你不知道他们的底细,是吧？
You don't know who these men are, do you?

861
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,170
我当然知道
Of course I do.

862
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,750
他们是经过挑选的士兵,对吧？
They're a picked unit, right?

863
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,890
精英队伍,千里迢迢...
Elite troops come all the way...

864
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,490
- ...从美国来拯救法国  - 不,不是的
- ... from America to save France.   - No, no.

865
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:17,560
我实话告诉你吧,几周前...
Suppose I told you that a few weeks ago...

866
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,490
...这些人都还呆在牢里
...these men were in a military prison.

867
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,930
- 大多数都是绞刑犯  - 你说什么？
- Most of them sentenced to hang.   - What are you talking about?

868
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,690
这是真的,玛丽
It's true, Marie.

869
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,270
他们被挑出来执行任务,并非因为他们是“精英”
These men were picked for this mission, not because they're "elite. "

870
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,340
而是因为他们的死活不重要
Because they're expendable.

871
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,940
不是因为他们是美军的骄傲
Not because the United States Army is proud of them, no.

872
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,310
他们都是窃贼或杀人犯
They're thieves and killers.

873
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,210
那你又是什么？
Then what are you?

874
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,210
嗯...
Well...

875
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,410
...我是负责挑选...
...I'm the officer who picks them...

876
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,110
...训练...
...trains them...

877
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,780
...带他们执行任务的军官...
...leads them into action, and more often than not...

878
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,790
...通常他们都无法生还
...most of them are killed doing the job.

879
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,820
玛丽
Marie.

880
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:55,360
我不能处决方提纳,即使我也很想
I can't kill Fontenac now even if I wanted to.

881
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,470
我需要带他去修道院
I need him to get back into the monastery.

882
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,730
展开行动
To launch the attack.

883
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,370
但对于这次任务而言,玛丽...
But for this mission, Marie...

884
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,480
...你更重要
...you're even more important.

885
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,670
你准备好了就叫我
Call me when you're ready.

886
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,790
任务结束后...
When it's over...

887
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,290
...我要亲手杀了方提纳
...I kill Fontenac myself.

888
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,250
爸爸妈妈怎么还没回来？
Shouldn't my father and mother be back now?

889
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:10,660
你得耐心点,费德里克
You must be patient, Fredric.

890
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,000
冷静一点
Try to be calm.

891
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,610
冲进去后,我来负责通讯室
When we get inside, I'll take care of the Communications Room.

892
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,450
你们去到建筑后面...
You go to the rear of the building...

893
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,850
...确保马丁内兹和其他人把炸药带进来
...and make sure that Martinez and the others get in with the explosives.

894
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,190
都听你的,少校
Whatever you say, major.

895
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,070
现在很晚了,神父
It's late, Fathers.

896
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,070
还不算太晚,中士
It is not too late, I hope, sergeant.

897
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,770
上帝应该还没入睡
I'm sure God is still awake.

898
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,990
快上,史坦
Go, Stern.

899
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:06,010
英国的飞机90分钟后会到
The plane from England will touch down in 90 minutes.

900
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,480
我们午夜就能回去了吧？
I guess we'll be on our way home by midnight, right?

901
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,310
对
You got it.

902
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,880
我很好奇,一个避世索居的修道士...
I was curious as to how a monk...

903
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:17,710
...为何竟会认得纳粹中士的徽章
...living in isolation recognizes the insignia of an SS sergeant.

904
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,990
你要溜出去散步吗,莫瑞斯？
Thinking of taking a little stroll, Maurice?

905
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,920
我可以把你弄到西班牙去
I can get us into Spain.

906
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,490
要一起去吗？
Want to come along?

907
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,730
敢踏出大门一步我就打爆你的头
Go through that door and I'll blow you to hell.

908
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,840
好吧,我们走
All right, come on.

909
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:44,120
凯利,我们进去吧
Come on, Kelly, let's get inside.

910
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:12,050
不
No!

911
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,910
老波？
Pops?

912
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,250
瑞典小子,去帮老波
Swede, help Pops.

913
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,510
怎么了？
What happened?

914
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,390
化学物质触发了燃烧弹,它们爆炸了
The chemicals must've affected the incendiaries. They exploded.

915
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,030
- 科学家的妻子们呢？ - 在地窖的另一头
- Where are the wives?   - On the other side of the cellars.

916
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,760
马丁内兹,你到楼上去把守
Martinez, you go upstairs and make sure nothing's moving.

917
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:39,230
凯利,史坦,你们跟我走
Kelly, Stern. You come with me.

918
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:06,320
- 走吧  - 什么...？这些孩子是谁的？
- Let's go.   - What...? Who are these children?

919
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,090
这礼拜学校休学,他们就过来这里了
They were brought here when their schools closed this week.

920
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:12,260
说是额外关照,但实质是把他们当做人质
Supposedly as a bonus, but of course they are hostages.

921
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,300
德军马上就要来了
The whole damn German army will be here in a minute.

922
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,410
我们怎么带上他们？
What are we gonna do with them?

923
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,680
走吧
Let's go.

924
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,340
新来的德军指挥官邀请了弗莱蒙夫妇去他别墅了
The new German commander invited Flamands and his wife to his villa.

925
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:31,040
不能等弗莱蒙夫妇了
We have to leave without Flamands.

926
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:35,410
不行,他是最了解Z-17的人
You can't. He knows more about Z-17 than the rest of us put together.

927
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,280
如果纳粹抓住他...
If the Nazis have him...

928
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:40,820
...他们可以在数周内重建你们摧毁的实验室
...they can put back everything you have destroyed in a matter of weeks.

929
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:43,290
我们没法把所有人都带走,少校
We can't get the whole group out of here, major.

930
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,520
我们把科学家带走,其他都留下
Let's take the scientists and leave the others.

931
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:50,190
你疯了吗？他们今晚处决了六个圣米歇尔的人质...
Are you crazy? They just executed six hostages in St. Michel tonight...

932
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:53,600
...就是因为你们杀死了那些水手,而抵抗组织里...
...because you killed those sailors and no one in the whole Resistance...

933
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,290
...有没人肯举报你们
...would give you up to the Nazis.

934
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,460
你怎么不告诉我他们劫持了人质？
Why didn't you tell me they'd taken hostages?

935
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,610
那有什么区别？
What could it change?

936
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:02,640
如果我们抛下他们的妻子和孩子...
But the wives and children will go to the concentration camps...

937
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,710
- ...他们都会被关进集中营  - 你说得对
- ... if we leave them behind.   - You're right.

938
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,910
我们要把他们都带走
We're getting them all out.

939
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,750
把他们带上卡车,一起去乘飞机
Now get these people to the trucks and onto the plane.

940
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,890
史坦,你跟我一起去别墅
Stern, you and I are going to the villa.

941
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,990
如果我们一小时内没有回来就起飞
If we're not back within the hour, take off.

942
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,700
这是命令
Now, that's an order.

943
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,260
这身制服倒是不错
That uniform's not a bad fit.

944
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,000
我用铁十字遮住了弹孔
Well, I used the Iron Cross to cover one of the bullet holes.

945
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,460
第四排,左边第三个
Fourth row, third from the left.

946
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:04,330
给他几分钟改时间,带他离开
Give him a couple of minutes, get him out of here.

947
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,230
明白
You got it.

948
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:33,630
- 怎么回事？ - 少校,党卫军刚才报告说...
- Yes, what is it?   - Colonel, Sicherheitsdienst just...

949
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,770
...1分钟前发现一架菲斯勒168型战机...
...passed on information that a Fieseler 168 was spotted over...

950
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,770
...刚飞过他们的空域并准备降落
...Charlene-Sur-Mer about 10 minutes ago and preparing to land.

951
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,460
反间谍部门告诉我们...
Counterintelligence informs us...

952
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,330
...现在那个区域并无合法飞机
...there are no authorized flights in that area at this time.

953
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:47,070
你知道坐标吗？
Do you know the coordinates?

954
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,880
- 在地图上标出来  - 他看见两辆卡车...
- Mark them on the map.   - He saw two trucks leave...

955
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:53,350
...15分钟前开往苏瓦松路,上校
...and take the Soissons Road less than 15 minutes ago, colonel.

956
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,780
好的,地图给我
All right, give me the map.

957
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:02,820
他们碰头的地点大概就在这里
The rendezvous will be in this general area then.

958
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,960
但他们应该还没到
But they can't have gotten there yet.

959
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:12,360
命令在苏瓦松路上设置路障,拦住任何交通工具和行人
I want a blocking force of vehicles and men at the Soissons Road. Here.

960
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,440
把他们引到北圣米歇尔的党卫军控制区
Pull them from the SS pool area in North St. Michel.

961
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,040
是,长官
Yes, sir.

962
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:21,230
把这些卡车给我拦住
I want those damn trucks stopped.

963
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,800
你不知道我妻子还在这里...
Don't you realize my wife is still in there...

964
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,960
...而且里面还有十几个德国军官？
...and there are more than a dozen German officers in the building?

965
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:01,600
你的其他家人和同事都在离开法国的路上
The rest of your family and colleagues are on their way out of France.

966
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:07,980
好啊,下午还是修道士,晚上就变成德国军官了
Well, a monk in the afternoon, and a captain in the German army at night.

967
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,910
变化真大嘛
What a transformation.

968
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,850
你开枪的话马上就会没命的
You shoot and you're dead in seconds.

969
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:14,890
这跟你无关,皮埃尔,你是法国人...
This has nothing to do with you, Pierre. You are a Frenchman...

970
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,430
我是法国人,我忠于马歇尔、贝当和法国政府...
Yes, I'm a Frenchman and I'm loyal to Marshal Petain and the French state...

971
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,860
...而不像一些叛国贼...
...not some degenerate traitor who...

972
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:51,270
别开枪！停火！
Hold it! Hold it!

973
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,210
打开
Open it.

974
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,560
打开！
Open up!

975
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,640
我们去机场！
Let's get on to the airfield!

976
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:50,460
怎么回事？
What's this coming?

977
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:03,370
慢点
Hold it.

978
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,280
究竟怎么回事？
What the hell is this?

979
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:13,550
我是霍中士,莱特少校的手下。人差不多都到齐了
I'm Sergeant Holt for Major Wright. We have the cargo, or most of it.

980
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,920
- 你们的少校呢？ - 他随后就到
- Where's your major?   - He'll be along.

981
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:17,530
恐怕难了
Oh, I doubt it.

982
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:21,860
- 他死在圣米歇尔了  - 他什么意思？
- He's in St. Michel. Dead.   - What's he talking about?

983
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:24,430
莱特少校跟另一个人去圣米歇尔...
Major Wright and one of our men went to St. Michel...

984
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,800
...去救项目主管和他妻子
...to bring out the project director and his wife

985
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,960
他派两辆卡车到苏瓦松路...
He sent two trucks along the Soissons Road...

986
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:32,570
...因为他猜测党卫军会发现你们在那里出现
...because he thought the SS would have a report that you'd be in the area.

987
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:35,770
他让我们从小道沿着河口走
He sent the rest of us along a side road that ran along the estuary.

988
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:40,310
我要等我爸爸妈妈来
I want to wait for my mother and father.

989
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,610
- 到飞机里等,孩子  - 我跟孩子一起等
- Wait for them in the plane, kid.   - The kid can wait with me.

990
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:47,720
- 没事的  - 我想还是别问...
- It's all right.   - I suppose I'm better off not asking...

991
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,720
...这些女人和孩子是哪里来的
...where the women and children came from.

992
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,420
- 我们该起飞了  - 少校和卡车还没到之前...
- We're already due out of here.   - We're not gonna leave...

993
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,160
...我们不会离开的,凯利！
...until the major and the trucks arrive. Kelly!

994
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:58,270
架起机关枪,严守所有道路
Set up the 30-caliber. I want you to guard all the approaches.

995
01:29:58,430 --> 01:29:59,730
他们来不了了,中士
They're not coming, sergeant.

996
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,340
他么死在苏瓦松路上或者圣米歇尔了
They're dead on the Soissons Road or St. Michel.

997
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:04,700
- 方提纳说的对  - 把枪架好,凯利！
- Fontenac's right.   - Set up that gun, Kelly!

998
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:08,110
你会浪费掉我们活着离开的最后机会
You're blowing our last chance to get out of here alive.

999
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:21,550
- 谢谢你们进来接我们  - 见到你真高兴,少校。我们走吧？
- Nice of you to drop in.   - Good to see you, major. Can we go?

1000
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,690
不,我派了四个人开两辆卡车把纳粹引开...
No. I've sent four men and two trucks out to decoy the SS away...

1001
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:27,060
...他们还没回来
...from the others, and they're unaccounted-for.

1002
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,060
妈妈
Mama.

1003
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,470
看来他们来不了了
Doesn't look like they're gonna make it.

1004
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,160
- 起飞！ - 妈妈
- Move out!   - Mama.

1005
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,340
费德里克！
Fredric!

1006
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,550
费德里克！
Fredric!

1007
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:19,080
我没法跟你们一起回家了,长官
I guess I won't be going home with you, sir.

1008
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,350
追上他们！
After them!

1009
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:01,180
你带领的是什么队伍,少校？
What sort of unit is it that you command, major?

1010
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:04,790
最高机密,孩子,他们都是精英
Top secret, boys. Elite troops.

1011
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:11,960
你一定以他们为荣
You must be proud of them.

1012
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:15,060
我非常自豪
You'll never know how proud.
