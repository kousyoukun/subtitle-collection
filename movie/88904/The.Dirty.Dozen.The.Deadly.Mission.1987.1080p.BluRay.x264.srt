2
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:30,699
Now.

3
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:20,745
What's happening?
Please! No! No!

4
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,543
No! Please! No!

5
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:39,339
That's not Mussolini.

6
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:43,267
No, no. ll Duce is not here anymore.

7
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,309
He left this morning with colonel.
He's not here now.

8
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:48,606
I swear to God.

9
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:52,104
Look, signorina, you better
put some clothes on.

10
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,819
This village is gonna
be full of partisans in a minute...

11
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:57,946
...and they'll be looking
for information or something.

12
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,810
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

13
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:34,905
Winston Spencer Churchill.

14
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,027
Good morning, major.
The general's expecting you.

15
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:18,526
Thank you.

16
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,070
Now then, Major Wright.

17
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,864
-Let me tell you what l got in mind.
-Suppose I said no?

18
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,536
Did I hear you right, major?

19
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,542
Come on, Sam.

20
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,036
I've taken two dozen men
on two missions.

21
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:35,337
Except for a couple
of them, they're all dead.

22
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,295
Yes, and most of them would
have been hung by now anyway.

23
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:40,841
A few of them would still be alive.

24
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:44,057
Mister, you refuse an order,
you face court-martial.

25
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:48,056
Court-martial finds you guilty and
you'll finish the war in a military prison.

26
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,187
Half the officers
in the European theatre...

27
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:52,815
...think you belong there anyway.

28
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:55,225
Well, maybe they're right.

29
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:00,064
That's a nice sketch, general.
Your work?

30
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,241
-Well, yes.
-That's a beautiful sketch, general.

31
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,028
It's my rendering of a secret
German document I saw last week.

32
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:09,743
-Do you know what it is?
-V2 rocket?

33
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,407
A much more powerful
version than that.

34
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,958
When the Germans make
that baby operational...

35
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,047
...it can reach New York,
Washington, Moscow.

36
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,758
It's an A4 missile.

37
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:23,011
The Germans were working on
something like this in the mid-'30s.

38
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,050
If they made it operational
in time for this war...

39
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,762
...they probably would
have won it already.

40
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:33,434
Well, I'll pass that along
to the Allied General Staff.

41
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:39,437
Supposing I'd painted a picture
of a missile landing in Washington...

42
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:44,073
...and what the results would be
if it were crammed full of poison gas?

43
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:47,445
-The Germans will never use gas, sir.
-Hitler's desperate.

44
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,456
He's gotta find a means
of achieving a quick victory.

45
00:05:51,624 --> 00:05:53,996
One that'll knock the Americans
and the British out...

46
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:56,375
...and give him a chance
to wipe out the Russians.

47
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,953
I'm not gonna explain
Allied grand strategy to you...

48
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:02,465
...except that there are
three dozen canisters...

49
00:06:02,635 --> 00:06:06,467
...of an experimental but deadly
nerve gas in a monastery in France.

50
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,837
We want them taken out...

51
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:10,767
...before they can be launched
by those new rockets.

52
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,215
Now.

53
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,304
-Use the Air Force.
-No, we can't.

54
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:18,555
There are six scientists,
top experts in chemical warfare...

55
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,774
...brought in from
the occupied countries.

56
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,818
We want them rescued
from that monastery.

57
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,649
You'll bring them out of France.

58
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,816
No, you got the wrong man, general.

59
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:29,614
You know, I'm not
on any rescue mission.

60
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,325
Get the phone number
of the International Red Cross.

61
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:36,875
Right now, mister, you're on your way
to Forbes Road military prison again.

62
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:41,670
My idea is that you start
finding another Dirty Dozen.

63
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:45,381
Of course, that may not
be your idea at all.

64
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,339
-Well, I was thinking--
-Nothing further at this time, major.

65
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:50,138
Yes, sir.

66
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,788
Got Joseph Stern here, major.

67
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,867
Death by hanging.

68
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,132
lnteresting record, Stern.

69
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:30,671
I mean, brief, but interesting.

70
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,254
For what you want done,
major, I qualify.

71
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,758
Oh, there's no doubt about that.

72
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,885
Let's see, born in Germany,
came to the United States in 1935.

73
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:43,184
ln '37 went back to Europe. Spain.

74
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,728
Fought on the Loyalist side when you
were only 17 years old?

75
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,731
I lied about my age.

76
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:52,489
Three armed robberies back in
the United States. No convictions.

77
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,699
A federal rap, gun running.

78
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,578
And you beat that one too.

79
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,206
Yeah, I've been running in luck.

80
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:01,577
Yeah, well, your luck ran out.
They finally nailed you.

81
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,873
Drunk in a bar
and killed an Englishman.

82
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:07,296
You want to hang for that?

83
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,878
-No.
-All right.

84
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,174
Let's see, you speak
German, you handle a weapon.

85
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,753
You know, my problem
is I gotta put a team together.

86
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:17,514
And according to this, you never
played on any team except your own.

87
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,599
Look, major, this isn't a baseball
game you're talking about.

88
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,183
You're talking about war.

89
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,109
You want to go
all the way to Berlin and back.

90
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:29,319
lf it's the only way I can
beat the noose...

91
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,730
...I'll follow you.

92
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,276
Just for the record...

93
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:37,944
...I wasn't drunk in that bar.

94
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,933
-All right, open up.
-Okay, Swede.

95
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,061
Bring out the bucket.

96
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,746
Eric Wallen, death by hanging.

97
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,573
They going to hang me now?

98
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:23,994
No, no, no, not now.

99
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,168
Maybe later, but not now.

100
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:30,172
-How long you been in solitary?
-I'm not sure.

101
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,498
He's been in solitary 25 days, major.

102
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,298
And what did they
send you to solitary for, Swede?

103
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:38,677
They tried to kill me.

104
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:42,467
He refused a routine
diphtheria inoculation, major.

105
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:43,722
The doctor ordered it...

106
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:46,682
...and he put the doctor
and three MPs in the hospital.

107
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:48,480
That's an impressive performance.

108
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,192
Let's see, you killed two British
citizens to get here in the first place.

109
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:55,029
They try to kill you too?

110
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:58,106
They tried to take my money.

111
00:09:58,284 --> 00:10:01,700
Oh, that's the last bad idea
they ever had.

112
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,700
According to the medical
examiner's report...

113
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:07,993
...you crushed their heads
with your bare hands?

114
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,538
I'm sorry about that now.

115
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:13,286
How'd you like to get
out of solitary, Swede?

116
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:15,707
-They're going to hang me, sir.
-Probably.

117
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:17,592
But maybe not.

118
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:20,045
Would you like one last crack
at the Germans first?

119
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,471
Could you tell me your name, sir?

120
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,304
Major Wright. And you
remember that, soldier!

121
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:27,220
Because from here on in...

122
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:31,061
...I don't think there's anyone else
who will be all that important to you.

123
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:48,195
I brought you together tonight
for a number of reasons.

124
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,498
One of them is to view
some secret footage...

125
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:52,875
...made available
to British lntelligence...

126
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:55,916
...by sources inside Germany.

127
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:58,125
Lights, please.

128
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,013
The locale of this film
is a small hospital...

129
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:07,930
...maintained by SS experimental
units near Schierling.

130
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:11,934
Our information is that this film
was shown to Adolf Hitler...

131
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,226
...and his production genius,
Reichsminister Albert Speer...

132
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,777
...less than two months ago.

133
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:25,113
She is being given a small dosage
of a new nerve gas...

134
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:29,449
...developed by scientists working
in France under SS control.

135
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:43,627
More gas is pumped into the room.

136
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:50,511
By now, her lungs
are collapsed by the gas.

137
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:53,974
Her heart has slowed.

138
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,400
Her brain is paralyzed.

139
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,142
And she's dead.

140
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,117
Lights, please.

141
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:15,323
Sam, how much time
do you think we have...

142
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,993
...before the Germans
start using this stuff?

143
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,998
Not much.

144
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,629
British Intelligence is convinced...

145
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,588
...that canisters of this gas
can shortly be delivered...

146
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:29,760
...to every part of the British lsles
by V2 rocket...

147
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:34,472
...without the loss
of a single German life.

148
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,888
Think about it, gentlemen.

149
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,524
All that for my benefit, general?

150
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,774
You have to be kidding.

151
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:50,072
Did it work?

152
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,525
More or less.

153
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,578
You know, I'm not
that fond of the Army...

154
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:56,369
...but after watching
those Nazi training films...

155
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,460
...I realize I hate
those bastards even more.

156
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:03,463
The Abbey of St. Francis
of St. Michel.

157
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,257
That's where it's at.

158
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,261
The sacristy, SS quarters.

159
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,216
The scientists are being held
in the old monk's quarters...

160
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,549
...and the canisters
are in the wine cellar.

161
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,560
Your orders, major.

162
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,520
You will take 12 general prisoners...

163
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:23,728
... convicted and sentenced to death
or to long terms of imprisonment.

164
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,145
You will train and qualify
the prisoners...

165
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,445
...and deliver them secretly
behind the lines.

166
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,367
You will attack and destroy
your assigned target...

167
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:34,073
...and you will free
the six captive scientists.

168
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,580
Any breach of security,
any failure of discipline...

169
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,419
...and the prisoners go right back
where they came from...

170
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,540
... for summary execution
of sentence.

171
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,708
Ferruci, Ernesto.
Twenty years hard labour.

172
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,841
Might add a little class to the act.

173
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:57,220
Okay, Pops, on your feet.

174
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,474
All right, at ease, Ferruci.
Sorry to disturb your labours.

175
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:03,221
No problem, major.
I got 20 years to finish it.

176
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,894
Well, if you--

177
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,776
-How old are you?
-Forty-four.

178
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,938
-Come again?
-Forty-eight?

179
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:11,608
Well, the Kansas City
police department...

180
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,657
...got you listed here for 52.

181
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,824
Oh, l thought the Army
might be good for...

182
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:18,372
...my security in my old age.

183
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,367
So I lied to the recruiting officer.

184
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:22,997
-Yeah, what's that?
-I write poetry.

185
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:25,162
-Do you?
-Yes.

186
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:29,588
At that little tent of blue

187
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,627
Which prisoners call the sky

188
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:34,761
That's a good piece
of jailhouse poetry.

189
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,469
-Thank you, major.
-Thank you, major.

190
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:41,426
lt was a great piece of jailhouse
poetry when Oscar Wilde wrote it...

191
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:43,727
...fifty years ago in Reading Jail.

192
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,143
Oscar Wilde?

193
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,890
I thought it sounded kind of familiar.

194
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:50,399
You really had it made,
didn't you, Ernesto?

195
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,608
With your phoney gas coupons,
food stamps...

196
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:56,737
...counterfeit British pounds.
You're a one-man black market.

197
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,283
Sometimes a man
gets desperate, major.

198
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,199
I met this English girl.

199
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:04,577
She was 25 years
younger than myself.

200
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:08,211
-I lost my head.
-It's a good thing she wasn't twins.

201
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:09,756
We would've lost the war.

202
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,132
I don't know, Ferruci.

203
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,922
You're a con man and a thief.

204
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:17,669
But where I'm going,
they don't just give you 20 years.

205
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:21,015
They turn you upside down
and let your guts roll out.

206
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:24,182
No. I think you're a little
too old for this project.

207
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,596
l'm not too old, major.
l'm in good shape.

208
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:29,181
Maybe I can help you with
some of the young kids.

209
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,186
Honest to God, major.

210
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:34,113
I don't want to die
behind these walls.

211
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,359
Okay, now, you listen.

212
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,700
You foul up one time and you
die in France. You understand?

213
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,412
Now, I don't know
what I'm gonna need.

214
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,617
French ration books, food stamps...

215
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:50,039
...German identification cards,
occupation passports, currency.

216
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:53,333
But whatever I need, I need fast.
And I need it perfect.

217
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:54,671
You got it, sir.

218
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,551
Never con a con man, Pops.

219
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:03,260
This is Webber, Ronald and David.

220
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:06,186
Thirty years imprisonment. Each.

221
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:10,059
Well, I thought I'd talk
to you two boys together.

222
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,649
-Since you're partners in everything.
-I always try to look after Davie.

223
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,023
Oh, you're the one. Well, look what
happened to little brother Davie.

224
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,698
You got him 30 years
and you're still taking care of Davie.

225
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:24,320
-Ronnie's tried to talk me out of things.
-Obviously not enough, right?

226
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:27,747
You start off as race car drivers,
and you wind up as what?

227
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,661
Auto thieves and killers.

228
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,330
Let me ask you something.

229
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:35,417
Do they give gold cups
for that kind of dumb?

230
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:39,424
All right, relax.
What's the last good year, boys?

231
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,506
'39, major.

232
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:47,017
We left the farm, went up to the Indy
with a 3.2 Maserati.

233
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,597
Man, we almost took it all.

234
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,264
And then what happened?
You run out of gas?

235
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:52,936
Not exactly.

236
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,148
We lost the farm
the next year, major.

237
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:57,941
One thing after another,
everything went down the drain.

238
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,940
Let me ask you something.

239
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,574
You boys,
you sprechen Sie Deutsch?

240
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:04,279
You mean German?

241
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:07,573
I hardly heard it since Daddy pulled
up stakes and took off years ago.

242
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,492
All right, you look German.

243
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,125
Put a uniform on you...

244
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:13,784
...keep your mouths
shut and then what happens?

245
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:16,999
People gonna think you
stepped out of the Afrika Korps.

246
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,126
Is that why you're picking us, major?

247
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:21,258
I'm picking you
because you're drivers.

248
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:23,966
One slowdown
and I'll run right over you.

249
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,634
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:32,601
You are now entering
maximum security, major.

251
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:34,682
I see. One....

252
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:37,736
You keep three empty cells
between Fontenac and the others?

253
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,145
Right, major. The idea
is to prevent the others...

254
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:42,813
...from getting to him
before we hang him.

255
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,233
Well, I really picked some
beauties this time, huh?

256
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,284
I'm sure the major
knows what he's doing.

257
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,363
I hope you're right, sergeant.

258
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,330
Simmons!

259
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,518
You move an eyelash
and I'll blow your head off.

260
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,414
You can scratch him
off the list, major.

261
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,623
And we'll hang him for escape.

262
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,246
Don't touch him.

263
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:44,879
He's perfect.

264
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:54,222
Yeah!

265
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,313
Lunge!

266
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,227
Lunge!

267
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:04,562
Left parry!

268
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,733
Right parry! Left parry!

269
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,365
Best you got, Martinez?

270
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:14,279
-Lunge!
-Come on.

271
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,915
-Left parry!
-Come on.

272
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,241
-Let's do it.
-Right parry!

273
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,328
-I got you.
-Lunge.

274
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,916
Right parry.

275
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,047
-Come on.
-I can't hear you.

276
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:26,707
Now lunge.

277
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:30,170
All right, recover. Recover.

278
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:32,090
I'm surprised.

279
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:36,100
I mean, most of you are in here
for capital offences, right?

280
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,807
It looks like the only thing
you've ever killed is time.

281
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,934
Put that on. So, what are you gonna
do when the Krauts show up?

282
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,898
Read them your trial transcripts?

283
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,896
You, Swede.

284
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,774
Catch.

285
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,907
Hold onto it, it won't bite.

286
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,661
I'm the enemy.

287
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,781
It's you and me.

288
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,368
Go ahead, lunge.

289
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,871
Major, I'll kill you.

290
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,455
There have been two great wars.

291
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,459
Sweden has managed
to stay out of both.

292
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,920
World War I and World War II.
I wonder why.

293
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:14,796
Is it because you're a peace-loving,
intelligent people?

294
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:17,595
-Or is it because you're cowards?
-Major, don't.

295
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:20,224
-Don't push me.
-I'm pushing you, Swede...

296
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:23,432
...because I want to find out
where you're coming from, all right?

297
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,647
Now, are you a soldier...

298
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:28,143
-...or are you a coward?
-Kill him, Swede.

299
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:30,147
-Come on, Swede.
-Stick him, Swede.

300
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:32,648
-Put him away, Swede.
-Get him, Swede.

301
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:34,105
Major, cut it out!

302
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,993
They want to know.

303
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:39,281
Are you a man or a gutless punk?
Lunge.

304
00:20:45,171 --> 00:20:47,080
What happens when
the Kraut comes along...

305
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:50,506
...and shoves this steel through
to the back of your head?

306
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,757
That's enough for this session.

307
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:16,698
Okay, okay, let's go. Line up.

308
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:18,743
-Move it.
-All right.

309
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:21,237
Everybody out of the trucks.

310
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,617
Fall in. Move it!

311
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:28,704
And when you're ready...

312
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,375
...count off.

313
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,458
-One.
-Two.

314
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,212
-Three.
-Four.

315
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:35,714
-Five.
-Six.

316
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:36,966
-Seven.
-Eight.

317
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:38,170
-Nine.
-Ten.

318
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:39,379
-Eleven.
-Twelve.

319
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:41,597
-Thirteen.
-There'll be only 12 of you...

320
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:42,883
...going on the mission.

321
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,721
So be on your toes.

322
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:47,221
One will go back to prison.

323
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:51,350
The infiltration under
the live ammunition course...

324
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:54,528
...is usually reserved
for the last week of training.

325
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,606
But the first week
and the last week...

326
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,407
...are one and the same
around here.

327
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:03,072
And besides, I want a fast
rundown on you people under fire.

328
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:07,245
The 30-caliber machine gun
at the other end of the field...

329
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:10,668
...is locked in to fire at 36
inches above the ground.

330
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:12,167
That's three feet.

331
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,000
Listen carefully.

332
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:16,333
Keep your heads down.

333
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:19,253
And you keep your butts
close to the ground.

334
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,921
Then you should
get through it easily.

335
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:25,055
But if you panic...

336
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:27,595
...then this mission
is all over for you.

337
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,563
All right, hit the ground.

338
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:33,935
Two at a time!

339
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:58,332
I can't do this.

340
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:03,097
-I gotta do something.
-You keep going, Hallet.

341
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:04,973
-Or he'll get us all.
-No.

342
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,015
Hallet, keep going.

343
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,644
Stay down! What are you doing?

344
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,932
Hallet.

345
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:14,849
Cease fire!

346
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:24,152
Goddamn it.

347
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,786
He's dead.

348
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,199
Now it's an even dozen, major.

349
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,415
You just used up your spare.

350
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,671
Get back on your bellies.

351
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,998
You're only halfway there.

352
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:44,590
Commence fire.

353
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:01,400
Take it slow, little brother.

354
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:06,155
It ain't like the major
to leave trucks sitting here.

355
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:08,319
I'm telling you,
it was the same last night.

356
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,549
You boys couldn't sleep, huh?

357
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,968
We're going out.

358
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:34,682
You're gonna
send me back to hang?

359
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,729
Not unless you want
to come along with us.

360
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:39,057
Yeah, sure, Swede,
we got room for one more.

361
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,894
Don't forget...

362
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,979
...if one of us fouls up...

363
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,072
...we all get it in the neck.

364
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:50,071
Swede, you gotta
think about yourself.

365
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:53,080
That's just what I'm doing.

366
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:56,662
You go back to the bunks.

367
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:21,814
You didn't have to get mad, Swede.

368
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:23,527
Like I said...

369
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:26,399
...you boys go back to the bunks.

370
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:28,400
Now.

371
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:40,162
Gee, Swede, I never want to be
around when you lose your temper.

372
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,715
Congratulations.

373
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,511
You got as far as survival school.

374
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,761
These shells...

375
00:25:58,229 --> 00:25:59,972
...contain two ounces of nerve gas.

376
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:02,436
It's odourless, fast and deadly.

377
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:05,142
Our mission
is to destroy a monastery...

378
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,317
...that may be crammed to the roof
with canisters of this stuff.

379
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,659
You didn't tell us about this.

380
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,985
Now, you've been given
preliminary instructions...

381
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:17,285
...as regards the use of the gas mask.

382
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:22,165
When that weapon is fired, you get
that mask on in three seconds flat...

383
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,791
...or we'll be burying some of you.

384
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,167
Ready, fire!

385
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:17,212
Get him in the air!
Get him breathing again!

386
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:20,220
Put him down.

387
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,808
Come on, come on, you'll make it!

388
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:29,189
He didn't know what the hell
to do with that mask.

389
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,605
But now the rest of you do.

390
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,940
You didn't have to kill Ferruci
to make your point, major.

391
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:39,568
Oh, well, all right, so I lied.
The gas in those shells...

392
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:44,113
...aside from rendering the victim
temporarily unconscious...

393
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,865
...has no lasting effect.

394
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:50,248
You can rejoin your buddies,
Ferruci.

395
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:58,962
Welcome to World War II.

396
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:39,587
Welcome back, Mark.

397
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,301
-How was London?
-A little chilly this month.

398
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:44,265
Good to see you again, Paul.

399
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:48,052
Let's get rid of this,
then we're on our way.

400
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,402
Everything is going
according to our plans, Paul.

401
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,654
A selected group of Americans
is already in training.

402
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:00,152
Have you seen Flamands again?

403
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:02,483
Yes, and they are eager to go...

404
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,858
...with one exception.

405
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:07,986
But there are terrible problems now.

406
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,454
-What are you talking about?
-Halt!

407
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,982
Hold fire.

408
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,580
Is this the man you saw talking with
your distinguished project director?

409
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,676
Yes, colonel, I'm sure of it.

410
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,632
Carl.

411
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,889
I want increased protection
for the abbey.

412
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,842
I want increased vigilance over
all air traffic in this province...

413
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,855
...especially single aircraft.

414
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,482
Notify the Sicherheitsdienst.

415
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,895
Yes, sir.

416
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,564
Well, now. They're beginning
to look like soldiers.

417
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,402
If you don't mind, I won't
tell them you said that, general.

418
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,894
Yeah, sure. I wouldn't
want to hurt their feelings.

419
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm sending them to jump school
next week and--

420
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,068
Forget jump school, major.

421
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,860
That's the principal reason I'm here.

422
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,821
There isn't gonna be any dramatic
parachuting into occupied France.

423
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,659
What are you saying?
These men have--

424
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,372
The British agent who jumped
into France was captured...

425
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,585
...and executed by the SS...

426
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,329
...along with the French Resistance
leader who met him.

427
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,378
There's been a leak somewhere.

428
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,094
You mean the mission is cancelled?

429
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,385
No, the mission is not cancelled.

430
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:35,017
But the Germans are monitoring
every flight into the St. Michel area.

431
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:39,266
And they've increased
a detachment of SS at the abbey.

432
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,606
They know something.
We just don't know how much.

433
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,690
So you'll go by sea.

434
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,235
You'll get the exact
coordinates later today.

435
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,732
And the code name
of the French Resistance leader...

436
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,159
...who'll meet you and get you
into the monastery is '' Marie.''

437
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,322
-Marie?
-That's right.

438
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,997
Her father was the leader
that the SS blew away.

439
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,828
That's the best we can do.

440
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,669
You want to send them
back to hang?

441
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,335
Come on, Chacon.

442
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,344
-All right!
-Come on, Chacon.

443
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,758
-Go, come on.
-Yeah.

444
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,339
-Go, go, go.
-Yeah.

445
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,467
-Go, go, go.
-Move over. Move over.

446
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,346
I got a gal in New Orleans

447
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,682
Sixteen kids and a can of beans

448
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,018
Five-feet-seven and eyes of green

449
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,437
But she's ugly and she's mean

450
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,690
-Sound off
-One, two

451
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,823
-Hit it again
-Three, four

452
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,243
-Cadence count
-One, two, three, four

453
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,371
One, two, three, four

454
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,747
I got a gal in New Orleans

455
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,456
Sixteen kids and a can of beans

456
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,036
Five-feet-seven and eyes of green

457
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,263
The target area.

458
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,720
The Abbey of St. Francis
of St. Michel.

459
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,552
A very holy place,
I would imagine.

460
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,969
Yes, it was a holy place, Kelly.

461
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,562
The monks have been sent to another
monastery of the same order.

462
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,184
This monastery is in the hands
of the SS Totenk opf...

463
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,069
...the Death's Head Division.

464
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,731
The Resistance has pinpointed
three main areas for us.

465
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,901
The radio room to knock out
communications...

466
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:19,070
...the wine cellars
with the gas canisters...

467
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:21,702
...and the machine gun post
on the balcony.

468
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,789
The travelling members of the order...

469
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,450
...are still permitted
to use the chapel.

470
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,586
And that's where you come into it,
Ferruci.

471
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,629
Yeah? What do you need, major?

472
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,293
These are identification cards...

473
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,967
...issued by the SS commandant
of the St. Michel area.

474
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,095
A Colonel Krieger.

475
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:40,590
I want two of these
for the brothers of the order...

476
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:42,926
...authorizing them to travel
for two weeks.

477
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:45,938
-It's sure nice to be working again.
-Oh, that's nice.

478
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,679
And make sure
the documents identify me...

479
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,233
...and Maurice here.

480
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:54,611
Are you saying, major, that you and I
are gonna go into that monastery?

481
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:56,110
Eventually.

482
00:33:56,616 --> 00:34:00,068
There are 36 canisters
in the cellar of the monastery.

483
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:01,704
We're gonna blow them up...

484
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:05,122
...and get out the six scientists
they're holding as prisoners.

485
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:09,123
We're going in there to bring back
six scientists? You told us we were...

486
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:12,795
-...gonna get a shot at the Germans.
-Relax, Stern, that'll happen.

487
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:14,211
And I got news for you...

488
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:16,460
...they're gonna get
a good shot at us too.

489
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:20,088
Martinez, that safe you blew up
in London, a piece of cake...

490
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:23,135
...compared to knocking out
those canisters at the monastery.

491
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:26,097
I never did a job like this.

492
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:28,062
But maybe I can do this one.

493
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:30,354
Oh, well, if you do...

494
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:32,767
...and everything goes right...

495
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:35,353
...then you're gonna beat the Army...

496
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,818
...out of 50 years in military prison.
How's that?

497
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,030
-What about the juice?
-The juice.

498
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:43,617
-The French will supply the explosives.
-Let me ask you something, major.

499
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:48,829
You say we're going to blow up
the canisters of poison gas.

500
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,326
Won't the explosions
spread the gas?

501
00:34:51,796 --> 00:34:56,256
Well, the best thinking is,
that if we use incendiaries...

502
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:59,584
...and the canisters are
in a tightly enclosed area...

503
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,671
...as they are
in the cellar of the abbey...

504
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:05,548
...the gas, in its present inactive state,
will be consumed by the flames.

505
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,683
Suppose the best thinking is wrong?

506
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:09,478
Then...

507
00:35:10,314 --> 00:35:13,101
...none of us will ever get
to play the violin again.

508
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,604
Well, I thank you for your attention.

509
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:25,827
All right.

510
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,119
What do you think, sergeant?

511
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:32,335
I think they're gonna bury you
in France, major.

512
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:34,744
They think the same thing.

513
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,952
Everybody out. Move it.

514
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:14,750
Let's go, let's go. Move it, guys.

515
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,161
You heard the major.

516
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:22,920
-What the hell is this?
-Don't look like a jump school to me.

517
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,754
No, this is some kind of port.

518
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,257
Southampton maybe.

519
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,222
Maybe we're gonna get
our shots here.

520
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,012
Look at that.

521
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:35,056
Oh, that's nice.

522
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,937
Hey, sarge, she got a sister?

523
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,934
All right, inside. Move.

524
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:42,941
Move it.

525
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:46,908
-Come on, move it, Pops.
-Don't call me Pops.

526
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:49,781
Now, Pops, don't get overexcited.

527
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,279
Well, here they are.

528
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:53,654
Good-looking men.

529
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:56,620
It's a transatlantic invasion!

530
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,287
-Hello, dear.
-She's gotta be dreaming.

531
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:03,465
-Come here, sit next to me.
-Think I died and went to heaven.

532
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:08,919
I'll have the big tall fellow.

533
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:10,592
Greedy.

534
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,554
All right, this is Martha.

535
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:17,301
Martha's the head mistress of this...

536
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:19,058
...very exclusive girl school.

537
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:32,196
Martha says you're part
of a very elite unit...

538
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,114
...just like our commandos.

539
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,365
Yeah. That's us.

540
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,498
An elite unit.

541
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:40,495
One in a million.

542
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:49,841
I like the slow dance numbers.

543
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:53,797
I prefer the fast ones, Yank,
but it's your party.

544
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,445
Easy does it, Yank, I'm on your side.

545
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,155
He's a rapist
and he murdered a WAC.

546
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:17,531
-You think he belongs here?
-You all belong here.

547
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,872
But do me a favour.

548
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,707
Keep an eye on him anyway.

549
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,537
Consider it done.

550
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:29,962
-Got any cigs?
-Yeah, chewing gum too.

551
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:39,384
Finally found something
they like to do.

552
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:42,812
What do you think will happen
when the brass finds out, major?

553
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:45,058
Forget about the brass.

554
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:46,942
I'm getting these guys killed.

555
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,068
The least I can do...

556
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:51,480
...is let them get lucky.

557
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:33,671
The sea is full
On the French coast

558
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:37,379
The light
Gleams and is gone

559
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:41,507
Welcome to France.
I am Marie Verlaine.

560
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:43,390
I'm Major Wright.

561
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,516
Maybe we ought to keep moving.

562
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:04,488
This way.

563
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,838
I'm sorry about your father.

564
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,082
-Was he betrayed?
-Of course.

565
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:19,298
I haven't been home since.

566
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,383
But there's a farm where we'll be safe
until we hit the monastery.

567
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:25,264
You been in touch
with the scientists?

568
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:28,553
The project director, George
Flamands, is waiting to see you...

569
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:30,804
...but there's something
you should know.

570
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,065
Two weeks ago, the SS Commandant
Colonel Krieger...

571
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:38,314
...decided the scientists at the abbey
needed better motivation...

572
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:39,733
...for their work.

573
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:42,990
-What are you talking about?
-Three of the scientists are married.

574
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,950
He rounded up their wives.

575
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,697
Are they in a concentration camp?

576
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,492
On the contrary,
they are at the monastery.

577
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:52,038
The 'honoured guests'
of the Third Reich.

578
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,119
I didn't come
to pick up husbands and wives.

579
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,584
I know why you're here, major.

580
00:41:56,756 --> 00:42:00,041
To blow up the monastery
and kill the Germans working there.

581
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,506
I approve of that motive.

582
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,741
Why can't we stay on the land
until we reach this farm?

583
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:26,992
Krieger has doubled the security
at every checkpoint...

584
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:30,115
...adding regular troops to the SS.

585
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,910
The Germans are so used
to controlling the river...

586
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,992
...that they've gotten careless.

587
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,169
All right, Marie. Let's go for it.

588
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:11,203
All right, I'm counting on you
to take out the radio.

589
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,039
Get down!

590
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:20,995
Where's Sturdivant?

591
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,702
He's dead.

592
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:27,537
Stern, get on the radio.

593
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:30,204
Familiarize yourself
with the vessel's call letters...

594
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:32,375
...but don't attempt any transmission.

595
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:34,591
You got it.

596
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:37,630
Let's get this craft cleaned up.

597
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:41,092
We're going up the estuary.
First class.

598
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,142
And make contact
with the Resistance.

599
00:45:55,157 --> 00:45:57,482
-Good evening, Marie.
-Good evening, François.

600
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,818
They are here now. We made it.

601
00:45:59,995 --> 00:46:02,154
-Very good.
-Yes.

602
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:31,849
Hey, this is just like home.
The one I ran away from.

603
00:46:32,027 --> 00:46:35,859
Major, how come we can't drink
some of this fine French wine?

604
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,115
Because I don't want a dozen winos
on my hands, that's why.

605
00:46:39,284 --> 00:46:41,193
Now listen.

606
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:44,703
You're all gonna stay down here
until 21 30 hours.

607
00:46:44,873 --> 00:46:47,198
The Resistance people
are gonna post guards...

608
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:51,159
-...but you all stay out of sight.
-Where are the French girls, major?

609
00:46:51,337 --> 00:46:54,338
-They did us a fine job in England.
-Yeah.

610
00:46:55,091 --> 00:46:58,294
Well, I just wanted you to know
what you were fighting for.

611
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:00,878
-Fontenac!
-Major?

612
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,513
We're going to the monastery.

613
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:06,471
Marie's arranged a meeting
with the director of the project.

614
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:08,720
George Flamands.

615
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,118
-What happened?
-We're not sure, colonel.

616
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:34,247
The boat was last in communication
at Salles-sur-Mer...

617
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,912
...about 5 p.m. yesterday evening.

618
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:41,385
lt was to patrol the estuary
and the approaches until 1 900 hours.

619
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:45,254
lt was found with no signs of life
at the estuary about 20 minutes ago.

620
00:47:45,432 --> 00:47:46,891
-What about the crew?
-Gone.

621
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:50,428
There are many bullet holes
on the forward and afterdecks.

622
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:52,561
Notify Army Group 7
headquarters.

623
00:47:52,731 --> 00:47:56,017
Yes, sir.
A commando attack, colonel?

624
00:47:56,193 --> 00:47:59,110
No. For what purpose?

625
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,697
The boat was taken for a purpose.

626
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:06,195
And when that purpose
was accomplished...

627
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,658
...the boat was abandoned.

628
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,498
We're lucky we found it this fast.

629
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:15,795
-What about the reserve ammunition?
-Expended or perhaps stolen.

630
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:18,536
We thought perhaps
the local Resistance.

631
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:29,880
The local Resistance
doesn't smoke Lucky Strikes.

632
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:34,971
-Major?
-Come in.

633
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,848
I'm sorry to disturb you...

634
00:48:39,027 --> 00:48:42,727
...but I'm going to see some of the men
who went into the city today.

635
00:48:42,906 --> 00:48:44,151
All right.

636
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,482
You go to St. Michel,
find out what's happening.

637
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,984
-In the meantime, I'll brief my men.
-Good.

638
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:50,442
Marie...

639
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:53,539
...is it gonna be difficult
to leave France and your family?

640
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,831
My mother died when I was a child...

641
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:59,003
...and my brother was killed
in the first days of the war.

642
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:03,165
Now that my father is gone...

643
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:05,750
...the only family I have
is the Resistance.

644
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:07,720
I'm sorry.

645
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:11,055
You really must know what war
is all about, right, Marie?

646
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:39,036
Beautiful.

647
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,247
Yes, but take a good look.

648
00:49:41,422 --> 00:49:43,248
Now, remember,
you're a monk, okay?

649
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,508
You've taken vows
of piety and non-violence.

650
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:49,839
You fake it good, or we're dead.

651
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:07,228
Morning, holy Fathers.

652
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,743
-I see you've come from Nimes.
-Yes, the new home of our order.

653
00:50:14,913 --> 00:50:17,534
But we have a great desire
to pray here, if we may.

654
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:20,329
Oh, of course,
are we the enemies of God?

655
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,747
Did you come by Nancy?

656
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,879
No, by way of Châlon.

657
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:29,215
It's much faster, and the scenery
is much more pleasant.

658
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:32,762
My impression exactly.

659
00:50:37,977 --> 00:50:40,219
Thank you, holy Father.

660
00:51:09,383 --> 00:51:11,292
You did a good job with the sentry.

661
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,128
Thank you. I was an altar boy.

662
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:15,795
Of course. I should have guessed.

663
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,646
Suppose your project director
doesn't show up?

664
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,151
No, he'll be here.

665
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,151
Look, when we leave...

666
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,734
...you tell the SS sergeant
we want to return again.

667
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:40,572
Tonight.

668
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,824
Could be evening prayer.

669
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,494
Very important for monks.

670
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,376
Perfect.

671
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:01,090
Good afternoon, brothers.

672
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:03,141
I think you have come
a very long way.

673
00:52:03,311 --> 00:52:05,185
In search of God.

674
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,893
That's a journey we all must make.

675
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:10,853
Monsieur Flamands, we're taking you
out of here tonight.

676
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,521
Good.

677
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:14,355
I'll start collecting my notes...

678
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,772
...and advising the other members
of my group.

679
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:20,116
Except, of course, for my
assistant director, Pierre Claudel.

680
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,695
-And why not him?
-He's a French Nazi.

681
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:24,699
Part of Vichy,
part of the Croix de Feu.

682
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,247
He may have caused
the death of Paul Verlaine...

683
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:28,960
...the local Resistance leader.

684
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,410
Major.

685
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,667
-That man could blow this thing open.
-He doesn't know.

686
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:36,511
If he knew more,
he would have denounced us already.

687
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,131
The plan.

688
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:39,846
We come here after midnight.

689
00:52:40,014 --> 00:52:41,722
We blow up our target...

690
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:43,765
...and get you out
in less than 20 minutes.

691
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:45,180
That's possible.

692
00:52:45,353 --> 00:52:48,188
But you must get us out of
the monastery before you blow it up.

693
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:50,562
-We'll do that.
-You'll have plenty of time...

694
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:54,145
...to make sure your wives are safe
and kiss them goodbye.

695
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,027
-What are you talking about?
-Monsieur Flamands.

696
00:52:57,198 --> 00:52:59,902
We didn't know about your families
when we landed.

697
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:02,649
This is a military evacuation.

698
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:05,533
We've got a problem.
We just don't have any room.

699
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:07,414
Then it's impossible.

700
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,370
Don't you realize what would happen
to my wife...

701
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:11,742
...and other hostages...

702
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,293
...the Nazis could think of
to threaten us with?

703
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:16,422
Why else do you think
we worked for them?

704
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:19,758
Perhaps because of your interest
in pure science.

705
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:27,180
I will be missed at my desk.

706
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:32,813
Make no mistake, I'm going nowhere
without my wife.

707
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:35,850
We will be ready in any case.

708
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:45,817
Pierre.

709
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:49,496
I had no idea there was
a religious streak in you, George.

710
00:53:53,503 --> 00:53:55,377
Colonel Krieger is on the phone.

711
00:53:56,548 --> 00:53:58,006
Thank you.

712
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,026
All right.

713
00:54:28,204 --> 00:54:30,956
Now the Resistance will have
two trucks in back of the abbey.

714
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:34,415
How about a tour bus and a guide
for these husbands and wives?

715
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:36,874
Major, it is crazy
to go bring them out.

716
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:38,623
Suppose the plane won't take off?

717
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:40,168
Oh, it will take off.

718
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:42,132
Besides, the flight's not that long.

719
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:45,670
And if we have to, we'll jettison
some of the reserve fuel.

720
00:54:45,846 --> 00:54:49,511
You said half the German air force
in France is in this area.

721
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:51,593
You gonna outrun them
with these people?

722
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:53,892
Yes, if I have to. Look...

723
00:54:54,063 --> 00:54:56,470
...the scientists won't leave
without their wives...

724
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:58,606
...and it's my job
to get them out of here.

725
00:54:58,776 --> 00:55:00,234
No, major.

726
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:04,363
Your job is to knock out
that monastery...

727
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:06,856
...and to keep scientists
from showing the Germans...

728
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:09,157
...how to make
more effective poison gas.

729
00:55:09,328 --> 00:55:11,071
What the hell are you talking about?

730
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:13,073
Give them a choice, major.

731
00:55:13,248 --> 00:55:15,122
The same choice the Army gave us.

732
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,368
You go or you stay.

733
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:20,042
Now if these people don't buy it,
we'll stop them.

734
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:22,336
Not only from making more gas...

735
00:55:22,507 --> 00:55:24,879
...but also from setting up
another laboratory...

736
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:27,589
...to replace the one
that we're about to blow up.

737
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,012
You're talking
about murdering them.

738
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,141
We are in a war, major.

739
00:55:39,065 --> 00:55:41,058
They have a choice.

740
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:44,275
You wanna leave it up
to these boys here?

741
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:47,897
-To vote on this?
-Maybe Fontenac's right, major.

742
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:51,028
Let them have a choice.
They're the brains the Nazis need.

743
00:55:51,494 --> 00:55:53,736
No, he's wrong!

744
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:55,705
And I'm not leaving here
without them.

745
00:56:01,337 --> 00:56:04,671
-Yes, Marie, what is it?
-Some men must go get the trucks.

746
00:56:04,841 --> 00:56:06,999
Others must get back
to their families.

747
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:09,963
The SS is conducting house-to-house
searches in St. Michel.

748
00:56:10,138 --> 00:56:12,973
Well, the Germans must have
discovered the patrol boat.

749
00:56:13,141 --> 00:56:14,683
Or they know it's missing.

750
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:16,927
But they have other duties
which may help us.

751
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:20,554
The new army general has arrived
to command the region.

752
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:23,269
There is a reception tonight
for him at the villa.

753
00:56:23,442 --> 00:56:25,649
And the reception will tie up
the top brass, huh?

754
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:29,402
All right. We finally got a break.

755
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:31,281
If they're entertaining the general...

756
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:34,819
...maybe security won't be as tough
at the abbey tonight. Maybe.

757
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:55,176
Claudel was here a moment ago.

758
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:58,136
-He says we have to get dressed.
-That's right.

759
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,766
The new German commandant
wants to see us tonight.

760
00:57:00,938 --> 00:57:02,480
We are to be his guests at dinner.

761
00:57:02,648 --> 00:57:04,771
You said the Americans
are coming to take us out.

762
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:08,690
I know, but I can't contact the
American officer leading the attack.

763
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:11,982
I don't know what his reaction
would be if I did.

764
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:14,280
Especially if I told him everything.

765
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:17,024
Did you tell him about us?

766
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,659
He knows that there are wives.

767
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:21,658
He doesn't know more than that.

768
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:24,454
Then you and I
must go with Claudel.

769
00:57:25,378 --> 00:57:26,789
That damn Nazi.

770
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:32,167
-A kiss, Papa.
-But of course, my son.

771
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:35,178
Mother says you're going out.

772
00:57:35,346 --> 00:57:38,550
Yes, we have to go into St. Michel
for a few hours.

773
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:40,349
Just your mother and I. Sorry.

774
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:42,427
You said we had to be ready tonight.

775
00:57:42,604 --> 00:57:44,146
That's right, my son.

776
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:47,018
And you may have to go somewhere
without us for a while.

777
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:49,149
-Just a while.
-You mean like the school?

778
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,026
Yes, like the school.

779
00:57:51,195 --> 00:57:54,399
No matter what happens, you stay
with your friends and Dr. Dufresne.

780
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:57,782
-Is that clear?
-We're all soldiers now?

781
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,695
So young to be a soldier.

782
00:58:08,337 --> 00:58:10,875
My people will get you
into the wine cellar of the abbey.

783
00:58:11,048 --> 00:58:13,041
We leave at 10 tonight.
Good luck, major.

784
00:58:13,217 --> 00:58:16,551
All right, I'll lay out that plan later.
Martinez.

785
00:58:18,055 --> 00:58:21,720
I couldn't help overhearing
some of the conversation.

786
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:23,684
If there is a problem in taking me...

787
00:58:23,853 --> 00:58:27,019
...I can head south,
and then try for Spain.

788
00:58:27,189 --> 00:58:29,146
Marie, I'll get you out of here.

789
00:58:36,115 --> 00:58:37,360
What do you want, major?

790
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:38,731
You trying to find out...

791
00:58:38,909 --> 00:58:41,365
...who's on your side
if there's a showdown?

792
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:43,743
I can tell you. No one.

793
00:58:45,207 --> 00:58:48,492
-What about you, Stern?
-I came here to kill Germans.

794
00:58:48,752 --> 00:58:52,086
Okay. You know, I did a little checking
into your record...

795
00:58:52,255 --> 00:58:55,256
-...while you were training.
-You should mind your own business.

796
00:58:55,425 --> 00:58:56,919
Those three banks you robbed...

797
00:58:57,094 --> 00:58:59,845
...all branches
of Trans-German Nord.

798
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:03,596
The largest German-owned
trading bank in New York.

799
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:05,510
Maybe I didn't know that.

800
00:59:05,685 --> 00:59:07,180
Maybe not.

801
00:59:07,354 --> 00:59:09,975
Or those guns you were arrested
for smuggling.

802
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:11,476
All wound up in countries...

803
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,567
...fighting against the Germans
and the Japanese...

804
00:59:14,736 --> 00:59:16,444
...even before we got into it.

805
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:18,440
-I told you....
-No.

806
00:59:18,615 --> 00:59:22,280
You haven't told me a damn thing,
but I'm telling you.

807
00:59:22,452 --> 00:59:24,076
Whatever you got up there...

808
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:25,574
...it's tearing you apart.

809
00:59:25,747 --> 00:59:27,122
What difference does it make?

810
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,410
We're all going to be dead
in a few hours.

811
00:59:35,465 --> 00:59:37,504
Stern isn't my real name.

812
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:39,419
It's the name of the family...

813
00:59:39,594 --> 00:59:41,882
...I was smuggled out of Germany
to live with.

814
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:44,717
Well, is your real name important?

815
00:59:45,641 --> 00:59:47,100
No.

816
00:59:47,268 --> 00:59:51,218
Most of the people who had it
are probably already dead.

817
00:59:51,606 --> 00:59:54,097
There were literally
dozens of us, major.

818
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:55,769
Maybe I'm the last one.

819
00:59:55,943 --> 00:59:58,861
So those six scientists
working for the Nazis...

820
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,567
...whether they live or die,
you don't give a damn.

821
01:00:02,992 --> 01:00:05,317
You got it, major.

822
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,990
I'm sorry.

823
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:11,909
So am I.

824
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:36,649
Lieutenant Karl Hoeffler.

825
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:38,690
He commanded
the patrol boat, colonel.

826
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,770
Any other sailors' bodies
recovered yet?

827
01:00:40,946 --> 01:00:43,863
No, but we know the area where
the attack must have taken place...

828
01:00:44,032 --> 01:00:46,819
...and we will continue searching.

829
01:00:47,536 --> 01:00:49,777
He died for his Fűhrer.

830
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,289
How many Resistance members
do we have in detention?

831
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:55,704
Six, colonel.

832
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,669
Hang them.

833
01:00:58,046 --> 01:01:00,715
Orders of Reichsleiter Himmler.

834
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:04,591
Post a notice of retaliation.

835
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,884
State that they are being
executed in reprisal...

836
01:01:07,055 --> 01:01:08,798
...for the murder of German sailors.

837
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:13,807
State that I may spare the six if those
who actually committed the murders...

838
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:15,722
...are identified.

839
01:01:19,234 --> 01:01:22,519
Marie and the partisans will meet us
at the north end of the monastery.

840
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:25,151
Martinez, you and Stern
take out the canisters. Holt...

841
01:01:25,323 --> 01:01:27,612
...you wipe out the gun tower,
then get inside...

842
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,527
...and blow the place to hell.

843
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:31,861
Maybe I can do this one.

844
01:01:32,038 --> 01:01:34,077
Ballews and Chacon
will go and support you...

845
01:01:34,248 --> 01:01:35,826
...from the upper balconies.

846
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,950
You got 20 minutes
to secure the monastery.

847
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:36,303
Hey, Pops. Where's Fontenac?

848
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:38,220
He said he was gonna
pull guard duty.

849
01:02:38,395 --> 01:02:42,013
That lying bastard. Come on!

850
01:02:52,826 --> 01:02:56,574
You move
and I'll cut your throat out.

851
01:02:57,163 --> 01:02:58,871
Get the major.

852
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:01,908
After I get rid of this pig.

853
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:03,330
No!

854
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,793
You don't make that decision.
The major does.

855
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:10,374
I'll be right back.

856
01:03:14,222 --> 01:03:16,428
Oh, you're beautiful, Maurice.

857
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:18,924
You're a real work of art.

858
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:32,488
What the hell happened?

859
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:01,509
Is there anything I can do to help?

860
01:04:01,685 --> 01:04:03,310
Get them out of here.

861
01:04:03,479 --> 01:04:05,056
You don't know who these men are,
do you?

862
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:07,223
Of course I do.

863
01:04:07,399 --> 01:04:09,807
They're a picked unit, right?

864
01:04:09,985 --> 01:04:11,942
Elite troops come all the way...

865
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:14,568
-...from America to save France.
-No, no.

866
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,610
Suppose I told you
that a few weeks ago...

867
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:19,576
...these men
were in a military prison.

868
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:22,995
-Most of them sentenced to hang.
-What are you talking about?

869
01:04:23,165 --> 01:04:24,742
It's true, Marie.

870
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:28,332
These men were picked for this
mission, not because they're ''elite.''

871
01:04:28,503 --> 01:04:30,412
Because they're expendable.

872
01:04:30,589 --> 01:04:34,004
Not because the United States Army
is proud of them, no.

873
01:04:34,175 --> 01:04:36,382
They're thieves and killers.

874
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:38,261
Then what are you?

875
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:40,256
Well...

876
01:04:40,432 --> 01:04:42,471
...I'm the officer who picks them...

877
01:04:42,642 --> 01:04:44,184
...trains them...

878
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:47,851
...leads them into action,
and more often than not...

879
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:49,849
...most of them are killed
doing the job.

880
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,894
Marie.

881
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:55,445
I can't kill Fontenac now
even if I wanted to.

882
01:04:55,613 --> 01:04:57,522
I need him to get back
into the monastery.

883
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:59,775
To launch the attack.

884
01:05:00,868 --> 01:05:03,442
But for this mission, Marie...

885
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:05,530
...you're even more important.

886
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,742
Call me when you're ready.

887
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:20,841
When it's over...

888
01:05:21,013 --> 01:05:24,347
...I kill Fontenac myself.

889
01:07:05,324 --> 01:07:08,325
Shouldn't my father and mother
be back now?

890
01:07:08,494 --> 01:07:10,736
You must be patient, Fredric.

891
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:13,071
Try to be calm.

892
01:08:00,962 --> 01:08:03,667
When we get inside, I'll take care
of the Communications Room.

893
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,500
You go to the rear of the building...

894
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:08,925
...and make sure that Martinez and
the others get in with the explosives.

895
01:08:09,095 --> 01:08:11,254
Whatever you say, major.

896
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,127
It's late, Fathers.

897
01:08:54,307 --> 01:08:57,142
It is not too late, I hope, sergeant.

898
01:08:57,309 --> 01:08:59,847
I'm sure God is still awake.

899
01:09:08,654 --> 01:09:10,029
Go, Stern.

900
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,075
The plane from England
will touch down in 90 minutes.

901
01:10:06,252 --> 01:10:08,541
I guess we'll be on our way home
by midnight, right?

902
01:10:08,713 --> 01:10:10,373
You got it.

903
01:10:10,548 --> 01:10:12,920
I was curious as to how a monk...

904
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:17,754
...living in isolation recognizes
the insignia of an SS sergeant.

905
01:12:00,365 --> 01:12:04,030
Thinking of taking a little stroll,
Maurice?

906
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:07,991
I can get us into Spain.

907
01:12:08,331 --> 01:12:09,529
Want to come along?

908
01:12:10,249 --> 01:12:13,784
Go through that door
and I'll blow you to hell.

909
01:12:21,302 --> 01:12:22,880
All right, come on.

910
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:44,163
Come on, Kelly, let's get inside.

911
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,089
No!

912
01:16:19,453 --> 01:16:20,947
Pops?

913
01:16:21,121 --> 01:16:23,280
Swede, help Pops.

914
01:16:26,502 --> 01:16:27,581
What happened?

915
01:16:27,753 --> 01:16:30,458
The chemicals must've affected
the incendiaries. They exploded.

916
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:33,086
-Where are the wives?
-On the other side of the cellars.

917
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:36,793
Martinez, you go upstairs
and make sure nothing's moving.

918
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:39,296
Kelly, Stern. You come with me.

919
01:17:03,663 --> 01:17:06,368
Let's go.
What--? Who are these children?

920
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:09,162
They were brought here
when their schools closed this week.

921
01:17:09,336 --> 01:17:12,336
Supposedly as a bonus,
but of course they are hostages.

922
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:15,340
The whole damn German army
will be here in a minute.

923
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,465
What are we gonna do with them?

924
01:17:27,103 --> 01:17:28,728
Let's go.

925
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:29,410
The new German commander invited
Flamands and his wife to his villa.

926
01:18:29,581 --> 01:18:31,075
We have to leave without Flamands.

927
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:35,461
You can't. He knows more about Z-1 7
than the rest of us put together.

928
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:37,337
If the Nazis have him...

929
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:40,875
...they can put back everything you
have destroyed in a matter of weeks.

930
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:43,340
We can't get the whole group
out of here, major.

931
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:45,588
Let's take the scientists
and leave the others.

932
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:50,260
Are you crazy? They just executed
six hostages in St. Michel tonight...

933
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:53,638
...because you killed those sailors
and no one in the whole Resistance...

934
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,356
...would give you up to the Nazis.

935
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:57,516
Why didn't you tell me
they'd taken hostages?

936
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:59,649
What could it change?

937
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:02,690
But the wives and children
will go to the concentration camps...

938
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,773
-...if we leave them behind.
-You're right.

939
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:07,942
We're getting them all out.

940
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,788
Now get these people to the trucks
and onto the plane.

941
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,948
Stern, you and I
are going to the villa.

942
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:16,042
If we're not back within the hour,
take off.

943
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,753
Now, that's an order.

944
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:31,322
That uniform's not a bad fit.

945
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:35,028
Well, I used the lron Cross
to cover one of the bullet holes.

946
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:01,517
Fourth row, third from the left.

947
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:04,394
Give him a couple of minutes,
get him out of here.

948
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:06,275
You got it.

949
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,677
-Yes, what is it?
-Colonel, Sicherheitsdienst just...

950
01:21:33,846 --> 01:21:36,800
...passed on information that
a Fieseler 1 68 was spotted over...

951
01:21:36,974 --> 01:21:39,809
...Charlėne-Sur-Mer about
10 minutes ago and preparing to land.

952
01:21:39,977 --> 01:21:41,519
Counterintelligence informs us...

953
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:44,392
...there are no authorized flights
in that area at this time.

954
01:21:44,565 --> 01:21:47,103
Do you know the coordinates?

955
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:49,934
-Mark them on the map.
-He saw two trucks leave...

956
01:21:50,112 --> 01:21:53,398
...and take the Soissons Road
less than 15 minutes ago, colonel.

957
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:56,824
All right, give me the map.

958
01:21:58,203 --> 01:22:02,865
The rendezvous will be
in this general area then.

959
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:06,001
But they can't have gotten there yet.

960
01:22:07,671 --> 01:22:12,416
I want a blocking force of vehicles
and men at the Soissons Road. Here.

961
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:16,460
Pull them from the SS pool area
in North St. Michel.

962
01:22:16,638 --> 01:22:18,097
Yes, sir.

963
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:21,301
I want those damn trucks stopped.

964
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:54,849
Don't you realize
my wife is still in there...

965
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:58,028
...and there are more than a dozen
German officers in the building?

966
01:23:58,196 --> 01:24:01,648
The rest of your family and colleagues
are on their way out of France.

967
01:24:01,825 --> 01:24:08,029
Well, a monk in the afternoon, and a
captain in the German army at night.

968
01:24:08,331 --> 01:24:09,956
What a transformation.

969
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,916
You shoot
and you're dead in seconds.

970
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:14,920
This has nothing to do with you,
Pierre. You are a Frenchman--

971
01:24:15,088 --> 01:24:18,457
Yes, I'm a Frenchman and I'm loyal to
Marshal Pėtain and the French state...

972
01:24:18,633 --> 01:24:20,922
...not some degenerate traitor who--

973
01:27:49,132 --> 01:27:51,290
Hold it! Hold it!

974
01:27:54,596 --> 01:27:56,256
Open it.

975
01:28:18,953 --> 01:28:20,613
Open up!

976
01:28:37,179 --> 01:28:39,670
Let's get on to the airfield!

977
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:50,519
What's this coming?

978
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:03,413
Hold it.

979
01:29:08,836 --> 01:29:10,330
What the hell is this?

980
01:29:10,504 --> 01:29:13,588
I'm Sergeant Holt for Major Wright.
We have the cargo, or most of it.

981
01:29:13,757 --> 01:29:15,963
-Where's your major?
-He'll be along.

982
01:29:16,134 --> 01:29:17,545
Oh, I doubt it.

983
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,883
-He's in St. Michel. Dead.
-What's he talking about?

984
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:24,465
Major Wright and one of our men
went to St. Michel...

985
01:29:24,643 --> 01:29:26,849
...to bring out
the project director and his wife.

986
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,013
He sent two trucks
along the Soissons Road...

987
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:32,605
...because he thought the SS would
have a report that you'd be in the area.

988
01:29:32,776 --> 01:29:35,812
He sent the rest of us along
a side road that ran along the estuary.

989
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,363
I want to wait
for my mother and father.

990
01:29:40,951 --> 01:29:44,651
-Wait for them in the plane, kid.
-The kid can wait with me.

991
01:29:44,829 --> 01:29:47,747
-It's all right.
-I suppose I'm better off not asking...

992
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,743
...where the women
and children came from.

993
01:29:49,918 --> 01:29:52,456
-We're already due out of here.
-We're not gonna leave...

994
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:55,202
...until the major
and the trucks arrive. Kelly!

995
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:58,299
Set up the 30-caliber. I want you
to guard all the approaches.

996
01:29:58,468 --> 01:29:59,748
They're not coming, sergeant.

997
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:02,383
They're dead on the Soissons Road
or St. Michel.

998
01:30:02,555 --> 01:30:04,761
-Fontenac's right.
-Set up that gun, Kelly!

999
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:08,136
You're blowing our last chance
to get out of here alive.

1000
01:30:18,905 --> 01:30:21,609
-Nice of you to drop in.
-Good to see you, major. Can we go?

1001
01:30:21,782 --> 01:30:24,736
No. I've sent four men and two trucks
out to decoy the SS away...

1002
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:27,117
...from the others,
and they're unaccounted-for.

1003
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,115
Mama.

1004
01:30:34,795 --> 01:30:36,503
Doesn't look like
they're gonna make it.

1005
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:39,210
-Move out!
-Mama.

1006
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:42,384
Fredric!

1007
01:30:45,222 --> 01:30:46,597
Fredric!

1008
01:31:15,836 --> 01:31:19,121
I guess I won't be going home
with you, sir.

1009
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:02,375
After them!

1010
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:01,226
What sort of unit is it
that you command, major?

1011
01:33:01,398 --> 01:33:04,814
Top secret, boys. Elite troops.

1012
01:33:10,574 --> 01:33:11,984
You must be proud of them.

1013
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:15,108
You'll never know how proud.
