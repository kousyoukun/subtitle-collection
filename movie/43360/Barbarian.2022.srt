1
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,709
八，八，三，一。
Eight, eight, three, one.

2
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,803
八，八，三，一。
Eight, eight, three, one.

3
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:22,776
好的。
Okay.

4
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,380
八，八，三，一。
Eight, eight, three, one.

5
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,683
来吧。八，八，三，一。
Come on. Eight, eight, three, one.

6
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,953
Motherfuck。好的。
Motherfuck. Okay.

7
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,759
消失。
Go away.

8
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,333
八，三，三，一。
Eight, three, three, one.

9
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,501
好的。
Okay.

10
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,404
八，三，三，一。
Eight, three, three, one.

11
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,074
哦，你在开玩笑吧。
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

12
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,709
哦。来吧。
Oh. Come on.

13
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,953
你好，我是大韦恩物业管理公司的邦妮·赞恩。
Hi, you've reached Bonnie Zane with Greater Wayne Property Management.

14
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,197
我现在不能接电话。
I can't come to the phone right now.

15
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,621
你他妈开什么玩笑。
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

16
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,016
请留言，我会马上给你回电话。
But please leave a message, and I'll call you right back.

17
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,994
你好。我是苔丝·马歇尔。
Hi. This is Tess Marshall.

18
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,498
我在城里。我在巴巴里的房子里。
I'm in town. I'm at the house on Barbary.

19
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:22,169
我在门廊上，下着倾盆大雨，箱子里却没有钥匙。
And I'm on the porch, and it's pouring rain, and there is no key in the lockbox.

20
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,973
所以拜托，你能回我这个号码吗?
So, please, could you just call me back on this number?

21
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,875
谢谢你！
Thank you.

22
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,678
该死的。
God damn it.

23
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,264
是吗?
Yeah?

24
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,269
不好意思，你是谁?
I'm sorry, who are you?

25
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,372
什么?你是谁?
What? Who are you?

26
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,409
这是巴巴里476号，对吧?
This is 476 Barbary, right?

27
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,645
是的,没有。是的,是的。我想是的。
Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah. I think so.

28
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,547
你不知道?
You don't know?

29
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,450
不。我不住在这里。我租了这个地方。
No. I don't live here. I'm renting this place.

30
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,951
现在是大半夜的。
It's the middle of the night.

31
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,029
我脑子里没有地址。
I don't have it in the top of my head, the address.

32
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,755
不，我是租的。
No, I'm renting this place.

33
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,923
什么?
What?

34
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,325
我…我租了这个地方。
I... I'm renting this place.

35
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,994
我…一个月前我在爱彼迎上订的。
I... I booked it on Airbnb like a month ago.

36
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,763
我在HomeAway订的。
I booked it on HomeAway.

37
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,097
你他妈的在开玩笑。
You're fucking kidding.

38
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,466
等待,等待。
Wait, wait.

39
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,801
等等，你确定没找错地方吗?
Wait, are you sure you have the right place?

40
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:01,935
是的,我……
Yeah, I...

41
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,940
我的邮件上写着巴巴里476号。在这里,对吗?
Yeah, my email says 476 Barbary. That's here, right?

42
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,810
我的密码能破译保险箱。
And my code works for the lockbox.

43
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,278
我应该在这里的。
I'm supposed to be in here.

44
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,682
你打给谁了吗?
Did you try and call someone?

45
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,550
是的。没有人回答。
Yeah. No one answered.

46
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,653
你确定你选对了日期吗?
And you're sure you have the right date?

47
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,622
看。
Look.

48
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,128
是的。我是说，它看起来是对的。
Yeah. I mean, it looks right.

49
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,098
他妈的。这是难以置信的。
Fuck. This is unbelievable.

50
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,435
我该怎么做?
What am I supposed to do?

51
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,808
我不知道。我不知道。
I don't know. I don't know.

52
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,843
你为什么不……你为什么不进来?
Why don't you... Why don't you come inside?

53
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,344
我们会给这些白痴打电话。
And we'll call these idiots.

54
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,677
你介意我…是吗?
Uh, would you mind if I... Yeah?

55
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,813
我要上厕所。
I need to use the bathroom.

56
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,515
是的,是的,是的。当然可以。
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

57
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,017
就在走廊尽头，左手边。
It's just down the hall, to your left.

58
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,053
好的。我马上回来。
Okay. I'll be right back.

59
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,663
你介意把你的预订确认书调出来，让我看看吗?
Would you mind pulling up your reservation confirmation, just so I can see it?

60
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,033
万一我是什么怪人，谁闯进来睡觉的?
In case I'm some kinda weirdo, who's broken in here to sleep?

61
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,806
是的,是的。不,它很好。
Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine.

62
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:46,974
让我找找我的手机。
Let me just find my phone.

63
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:46,834
这里。
Here.

64
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,301
耶稣。
Jesus.

65
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,403
我很抱歉。我不知道你回来了。
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were back.

66
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:53,306
我只是在拿手机。对不起。
I was just getting my phone. Sorry.

67
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,642
这里是……事情是这样的。
Here's... Here's the thing.

68
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,977
正确的。
Right.

69
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,480
是的。在我看来是对的。
Yep. That looks right to me.

70
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
太好了。
Great.

71
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,488
也许我在"家园之家"的电话号码和你打的不一样?
Maybe I have a different number through HomeAway than the one that you called?

72
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,357
这就是我得到的。
This is what I got.

73
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,663
303 - 5……5……303 - 509…是的,那……这是同一个。
303-5... 5... 303-509... Yeah, that... That's the same one.

74
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,668
是的。
Yeah.

75
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,070
听着，我不知道这是什么规矩。
Listen, I don't know what the protocol is for this.

76
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,639
我也不。
Me neither.

77
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,713
嗯…我想我还是找别的地方吧。
Um... I guess I'll just find somewhere else.

78
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,014
我的意思是……是的。
I mean... Yep.

79
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,983
看来我要这么做了。
Guess I'm gonna do that.

80
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,385
我不打扰你睡觉了。
Uh, I'll let you get back to sleep.

81
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,653
我感觉很糟糕。
I feel bad.

82
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,189
这显然不是你的错。
It's clearly not your fault.

83
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,391
你打算怎么办?
What are you gonna do?

84
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,860
开车到处转，找个酒店?
Just go drive around, looking for a hotel?

85
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,229
我有手机。打几个电话。
I have my phone. Make some calls.

86
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,530
在你的车吗?
In your car?

87
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,701
是啊，我觉得这不是个好主意。
Yeah, I don't think that's such a good idea.

88
00:08:53,834 --> 00:09:00,173
我的意思是，我不知道你有没有看清楚这个社区，但它不是…我觉得这么晚了你不应该一个人坐在外面。
I mean, I don't know if you got a great look at this neighborhood, but it's not... I don't think you should be sitting out there by yourself this late.

89
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,842
我是说，我不会那么做。
I mean, I wouldn't do that.

90
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:09,482
听着，很明显，你想怎么做就怎么做，但如果你想待在这里，这里很干燥，门上有锁，我完全不介意。
Look, obviously, do whatever you want, but if you wanna hang out in here, where it's dry, and there's a lock on the door, I'm totally fine with that.

91
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,963
这是Wi-Fi信息…谢谢。如果你需要的话。
Uh, here's the Wi-Fi info... Thanks. If you need it.

92
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,699
哦，对了，我叫凯斯。
Oh, by the way, I'm Keith.

93
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,333
苔丝。
Tess.

94
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,202
苔丝。这名字真好听。
Tess. That's a pretty name.

95
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,072
谢谢。
Thanks.

96
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,573
你要什么吗?
Do you want anything?

97
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,542
我想厨房里有茶。
I think there's some tea in the kitchen.

98
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,377
嗯…想要一些茶吗?
Um... Want some tea?

99
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,212
我很好。谢谢你！好吧。
I'm okay. Thank you. Okay.

100
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,183
嗯…哦,狗屎,是的。有……有人把一瓶酒落在这里了。
Um... Oh, shit, yeah. There's... Somebody left out a bottle of wine here.

101
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,119
上面还有丝带，就像乔迁之喜一样。
With a ribbon on it, like a housewarming thing.

102
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,055
这里还有一些坚果。
And there's some nuts here, too.

103
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,890
我只是说。
I'm just saying.

104
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,023
我很好。
I'm okay.

105
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,325
是的。是的。好的,很酷。
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool.

106
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,762
嗯，我要喝点茶。
Um, I'm gonna have some tea.

107
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,596
我给你泡一杯。
I'll just make you a cup.

108
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:04,371
你好。嗨，我在想，你们还有空房吗?
Hi. Hi, I was just wondering, do you have any rooms available?

109
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,273
是的。今晚，没错。
Yeah. For tonight, that's right.

110
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,176
真的吗?
Really?

111
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,111
好的,谢谢。
Okay, thanks.

112
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,281
嗯…大便。
Uh... Shit.

113
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,916
你知道我刚意识到什么吗?
You know what I just realized?

114
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,226
顺便说一下，水正在升温。
The water is heating up, by the way.

115
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,410
你知道我刚意识到什么吗?
You know what I just realized?

116
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,553
那是什么?城里有个大会。
What's that? There's a convention in town.

117
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:21,722
什么?
What?

118
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,957
是啊，好像有什么重大的医疗问题。
Yeah, there's, like, some huge medical thing.

119
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,291
我觉得你今晚订不到房间了。
I don't think you're gonna be able to get a room tonight.

120
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,766
我真不敢相信。
I can't believe this.

121
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,005
好的。这是我的建议。
All right. Here's what I propose.

122
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,639
你为什么不住在这里呢?
Why don't you just crash here?

123
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:44,788
哦,不。我不…我不认为那是…不,不,不。你睡卧室，我睡外面的沙发。
Oh, no. I don't... I don't think that's... No, no, no. You take the bedroom, and I'll sleep out here on the couch.

124
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,492
明天，我们就给这些白痴打电话。
And then tomorrow, we'll call these idiots.

125
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,615
把我们的钱拿回来。我们俩都可以免费入住。
Get our money back. Free stay for both of us.

126
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,485
真不敢相信。
Really can't believe this.

127
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,122
我是说，我不知道还能做什么。
I mean, I don't know what else there is to do.

128
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,330
我可以睡沙发。不,不,不。
I can take the couch. No, no, no.

129
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:08,836
随便你怎么称呼我，但我不可能睡在卧室而一个年轻女士却睡在沙发上。
Call me what you want, but there's no way I'm sleeping in the bedroom while a young lady is sleeping on the couch.

130
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,209
都怪我的教养，但这没得商量。
Blame it on my upbringing, but it's not up for discussion.

131
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:17,477
无意冒犯，但我对干净的床单有个癖好。
Well, no offense, but I kinda have a thing about clean sheets.

132
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,974
你真的没必要这么做。
You really didn't have to do that.

133
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,867
根本没必要讨论。
Not even up for discussion.

134
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,601
再说了，我有雨衣，而你没有。
Besides, I have a raincoat and you don't.

135
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,679
不，不，我来吧。哦。不,不,不。
No, no, I got it. Oh. No, no, no.

136
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,948
你确定吗?你确定吗?我可以……是的。
You sure? You sure? I can... Yeah.

137
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,239
好吧。
Okay.

138
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,808
你把这个落在卧室了。
You left this in the bedroom.

139
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,810
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

140
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,711
谢谢。好眼睛。
Thanks. Good eyes.

141
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:25,846
我去洗一下。
I'm gonna go wash up.

142
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,380
是的。把这当自己的家。
Yeah. Knock yourself out.

143
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,333
哦,嘿。
Uh, hey.

144
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,335
衣服还在洗呢。
Uh, the laundry's still in the wash.

145
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:57,077
嗯…但我想，嗯，我很清醒，所以…所以我,嗯…现在要有点了。
Um... But I thought, well, I'm wide awake, so... So I, um... It's gonna be a bit now.

146
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,013
我想喝点这瓶酒。
I thought I'm gonna have some of this here wine.

147
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:06,719
但我不想在你洗完澡之前打开因为我注意到你没喝茶。
But I didn't wanna open it before you got out of the shower because I noticed you didn't drink your tea.

148
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,156
顺便说一句，我完全理解。
And, well, I totally get that, by the way.

149
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,326
我是说，你不了解我，现在的情况真的很奇怪。
I mean, you don't know me, and this is a fucking really weird situation.

150
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,462
这是完全有道理的。
It makes total sense.

151
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:19,566
但我觉得你可能想喝点这个。
Um, but I thought that you might want some of this.

152
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:25,805
但如果我在你不在的时候打开它，那…那他妈的,我很抱歉。我漫步。
But if I opened it while you weren't here, that... that... Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm rambling.

153
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:26,940
耶稣基督。
Jesus Christ.

154
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:32,069
嗯…我以为你没看到我打开就不会想要了。
Um... I thought you wouldn't want any if you didn't see me open it.

155
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,513
所以,我等待着。
So, I waited.

156
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,952
我很好，你去吧。
I'm good, but you go ahead.

157
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,954
你确定吗?是的。
You sure? Yeah.

158
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,956
好的。嗯…
Okay. Um...

159
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:55,368
嗯,这是……要我说，在铺好被褥之前，你有一个小时的时间换衣服。
Um, it's... I'd say you have about an hour and change till the bedding's done.

160
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,438
你能做到吗?
You gonna make it?

161
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,741
我到处找干净的，但找不到。
I looked around for some clean ones, but I couldn't find any.

162
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,376
你要在沙发上做什么?
What are you gonna do on the couch?

163
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,813
哦，我会没事的。是的。我睡过更糟的。
Oh, I'll be fine. Yeah. I've slept on worse.

164
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,155
对于这一切我真的很抱歉。
I'm really sorry about all this.

165
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,523
你在开玩笑吗?
What, are you kidding?

166
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,926
这不是你的错。你和我一样心烦意乱。
It's not your fault. You're just as put out as me.

167
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,136
要我再给你沏杯茶吗?
Do you want me to make you another cup of tea?

168
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,038
不。
No.

169
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,539
这次你可以看了。
You can watch this time.

170
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,740
我很好。
I'm okay.

171
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,043
所以,嗯…
So, um...

172
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,047
什么风把你吹来了?
What brings you to town?

173
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,349
工作面试。噢,是吗?
Job interview. Oh, yeah?

174
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,516
是明天吗?
Is it tomorrow?

175
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,752
是的。
Yeah.

176
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,221
如果你不介意我问的话，这份工作是做什么的?
What's the job about, if you don't mind me asking?

177
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,190
是的。没关系。
Yeah. It's okay.

178
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:55,395
这是一个纪录片导演的研究职位。
Um, it's a research position for a documentary filmmaker.

179
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,630
真的吗?谁是导演?
Really? Who's the filmmaker?

180
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,766
她叫凯瑟琳·詹姆斯。
Her name is Catherine James.

181
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,901
凯瑟琳詹姆斯吗?
Catherine James?

182
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,803
我不认识她。
I don't know her.

183
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,438
她做过什么我见过的事吗?
Has she done anything I'd seen?

184
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:10,343
她去年拍了一部关于爵士乐的电影，叫《蓝色轻松》。
Uh, she made a movie about jazz last year, called Blue Easy.

185
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,979
哦，我看到了。
Oh, I saw that.

186
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,280
你看过Blue Easy吗?
You saw Blue Easy?

187
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,747
我觉得很棒。
I thought it was great.

188
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,851
你在开玩笑吧?没人看过那部电影。
Are you kidding? No one's seen that movie.

189
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,887
临时铜管乐队的事?
About the makeshift brass band?

190
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,457
还有孩子们在屋顶上，玩Coltrane的歌的那场戏?
And there's that scene with the kids on the rooftop, playing the Coltrane stuff?

191
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,026
是的,这很好。
Yeah, it's great.

192
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,427
真不敢相信你看到了。
I can't believe you saw that.

193
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,628
我觉得太棒了。
I thought it was awesome.

194
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,563
她的新电影要讲什么?
What's her new film gonna be about?

195
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,233
是关于这个地方的。底特律。
Oh, it's gonna be about this place. Detroit.

196
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,534
像底特律的音乐吗?
Like Detroit music?

197
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:42,775
哦，好吧，它将是关于过去十年来这里的艺术家们，他们在这里建立了集体和创意社区……嗯，边缘…
Oh, well, it's gonna be about the artists that have come here in the last ten years and set up collectives and creative communities on the... Well, the edge of...

198
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,611
那里的房子基本上是免费的。
Where the houses are basically free.

199
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,613
这是很酷。
That's pretty cool.

200
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,506
你知道该去面试谁吗?
Do you know who you should interview for that?

201
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,016
谁?
Who?

202
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,684
我。
Me.

203
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,686
这是为什么呢?
Why is that?

204
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,789
因为我是驯狮人的创始人之一。
Because I'm actually one of the founders of the Lion Tamers.

205
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,926
你在开玩笑吧。不。
You're kidding. No.

206
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,997
我是说，我不是那种人，但我是他们中的一员。
I mean, I'm not, like, the guy, but I'm one of the guys, yeah.

207
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,131
这是疯狂的。
That's insane.

208
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,966
它是疯狂的。
It is insane.

209
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,668
你在爱彼迎上做什么?
What are you doing in an Airbnb?

210
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,921
你们不是有一整条街之类的吗?
Don't you guys, like, have a whole block or something?

211
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,971
不,是的。不,我们做的。
No, yeah. No, we do.

212
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,174
但我们在找一个新的地方。
But we're looking for a new space.

213
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:18,478
我在这里待了一周，基本上就是在这一带扫荡。
So, I'm here for a week, basically just scouring this side of town.

214
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,148
寻找我们的下一个小窝。
Looking for our next little nest.

215
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,882
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

216
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,420
这不是我以前听过的陈词滥调。
It's not a cliche I've heard before.

217
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,422
哦,来吧。这太老套了。
Oh, come on. It's such a cliche.

218
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,225
那个认为爱和控制是一回事的人。
The guy who thinks love and control are the same thing.

219
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:38,131
而那个让自己变成，我不知道，某种宠物什么的女孩呢?
And the girl who lets herself become, I don't know, some kind of pet or something?

220
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,744
哦,我的上帝。这太老套了，太无聊了，我不敢相信这发生在我身上。
Oh, my God. It's so cliche and it's so boring, and I can't believe it's happening to me.

221
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,103
现在还在发生吗?
Is it still happening?

222
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,372
我是说，看看你。
I mean, look at you.

223
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,074
你的新工作已经安排好了。
You already got your new job lined up.

224
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,442
嗯。工作面试。
Mmm. Job interview.

225
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,378
我还没有得到那份工作。我不是自由的。
I don't have the job yet. I'm not home free.

226
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:59,719
看。总有一些人会在我们身上投射某种为他们服务的动力。
Look. There's always gonna be people that project some kind of dynamic onto us that serves them.

227
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,689
我们要不要合作由我们自己决定。
It's up to us if we wanna play ball or not.

228
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,125
这是我的教训吗?
Is that my lesson?

229
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,194
我不知道。我不知道。
I don't know. I don't know.

230
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,097
我只是不能再回去了。
I just need to stop going back.

231
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,200
我一直往回走。
I keep going back.

232
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,401
也许就是这样。
Maybe that's it.

233
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:19,906
或者我的经验是，只要你允许，男人就会欺负你。
Or maybe my lesson is that guys will walk all over you as long as you let them.

234
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,674
是的。这是我的教训。
Yeah. That's my lesson.

235
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,543
我不同意那种说法。
I take issue with that statement.

236
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,278
哦,是的。那是因为你是男的。
Oh, yeah. That's 'cause you're a guy.

237
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,280
我是说，世界对你来说不一样了。
I mean, the world's different for you.

238
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,717
男人一生都在制造混乱。
Guys get to blast their way through life making messes.

239
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,485
女孩们要小心。
Girls have to be careful.

240
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,587
详细说明。好的。今晚。
Elaborate. Okay. Take tonight.

241
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,226
如果我是最先登记入住的人，而你却在深夜出现……怎么，你不让我进去吗?
If I had been the one that checked in first and you showed up late at night... What, you wouldn't have let me in?

242
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,960
没有地狱。我不会让你进来的。
Hell no. I wouldn't have let you in.

243
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,729
你觉得我疯了吗?
Do you think I'm crazy?

244
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,342
但如果我蠢到让你进来，你会毫不犹豫的。
But if I was dumb enough to let you in, you wouldn't even think twice.

245
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,500
你会大摇大摆地走进来。
You would just march on in.

246
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,068
嘿，你就这么大摇大摆进来了。
Hey, you just marched on in.

247
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,202
是的，因为我必须这么做。
Yeah, because I had to.

248
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,871
这很可怕。
And it was scary.

249
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,906
怎么，我看起来像什么怪物吗?
What, do I look like some kind of monster?

250
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,308
不是我的观点。
Not my point.

251
00:17:55,442 --> 00:18:02,149
我明白了。我明白了。我的意思是……外面有很多坏人。这糟透了。
I get it. I get it. I mean... There's a lot of bad dudes out there. And it sucks.

252
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:07,038
听着，你是要被困在别人为你挑选的该死的有毒的生活中吗?
Look, are you gonna stay locked into some fucked-up toxic dynamic that somebody else picked for you?

253
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,288
还是你要继续生活?
Or are you gonna move on?

254
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,290
也许可以找别人。
Maybe find someone else.

255
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,261
即使这意味着你可能会再次被挖出你的心脏。
Even if that means that you may get your heart ripped outta your chest all over again.

256
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,032
嗯。为什么总是女孩们被这种事折磨得心力交瘁?
Hmm. Why is it always the girls who get their hearts ripped out in these things?

257
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,237
女孩可以撷取。相信我。
Girls can rip. Trust me.

258
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,839
好了，现在它都翻出来了…正确的。
Okay, so now that it's inside out... Right.

259
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,184
对吧?这是第一步。是吗?
Right? That's the first step. Yeah?

260
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,509
然后，现在你有点深入了。不。
Then, now you kind of go deep. No.

261
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,178
你潜水。
You dive in.

262
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,688
现在,这……相信我。这是最好的方法。
Now, this... Trust me. This is the best way to do it.

263
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,357
不，你在耍我。这不是你该做的。
No, you're fucking with me. This is not how you do it.

264
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,261
-你就该这么做。-这是最好的办法。
- This is how you do it. - This is the best way.

265
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,285
它从来不会结块。它变得非常光滑。
It never bunches up. It gets completely smooth.

266
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,979
等你躺在一张完全平整的羽绒被里，你会感谢我的。
You'll thank me later when you're lying under a perfectly even duvet, here.

267
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,198
所以,如果,但是……看起来很愚蠢。
So, if, but... Looks so dumb.

268
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,656
所以,这里……对吧?
So, here... Right?

269
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,925
这就是我需要你帮助的地方。
Here is where I kinda need your help a little bit.

270
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,303
既然你来了…哦,我的上帝。
Now that you're here... Oh, my God.

271
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,537
你必须做我的助理。正确的。
You have to be my assistant. Right.

272
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,897
如果你不介意的话，拿上羽绒被…好吧。
If you wouldn't mind, grabbing the duvet... Okay.

273
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,101
你给我两条边，我的边在哪里。是的,当然。
And you kinda give me the two edges where my edges are... Yeah, sure.

274
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,912
在两者相遇的地方。好的，谢谢。
Where the two meet. All right, thank you.

275
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,214
好的。你明白了吗?非常感谢。
Okay. You got it? Thank you very much.

276
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:02,309
所以，退后，因为现在它变得有点…一个小…我的上帝。
So, back up 'cause now it gets a little bit... A little... My God.

277
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,178
这东西有点咄咄逼人。哦,我的上帝。
A little aggressive with the thing. Oh, my God.

278
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:10,317
但这样你才能把羽绒被放进去。
But that is how you get the duvet in.

279
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,220
那么优雅。这就是你要做的。
So graceful. That's how you do it.

280
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,855
你通常都是这样上气不接下气的吗?
Are you usually this outta breath afterwards?

281
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,459
最后……请抓住那个边缘。嗯。
The final... Grab that edge there, please. Mmm-hmm.

282
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,329
好,…是的,是的。
Okay, and... Yeah, yeah.

283
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,030
哇。
Wow.

284
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,435
好的。好吧，你正式就位了。
Okay. Well, you are officially situated.

285
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,503
是的。我想那差不多了。
Yeah. I think that about does it.

286
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,474
是的。
Yeah.

287
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,980
好的，谢谢你今晚的款待。
Okay, thank you for tonight.

288
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,383
很抱歉在大喜的日子之前让你睡不着。
Sorry for keeping you up before the big day.

289
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,354
哦,不。它是乐趣。我…我喜欢它。
Oh, no. It was fun. I... I liked it.

290
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,155
是的。我也是。
Yeah. Me, too.

291
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,797
好吧，有个沙发需要…是的。是的。
Okay, there's a couch that needs to be... Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,367
在这里加档，所以…我很抱歉。
Put in gear here, so... I'm so sorry.

293
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,201
哦,不要。不要。
Oh, don't be. Don't be.

294
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,703
我什么都能睡。
I can sleep on anything.

295
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,705
晚安,苔丝。
Good night, Tess.

296
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,839
晚安,基思。
Good night, Keith.

297
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,398
基思?
Keith?

298
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,914
基思?
Keith?

299
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,927
帮助我。
Help me.

300
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,137
不。不。
No. No.

301
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,174
基思?
Keith?

302
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,483
他妈的!
The fuck!

303
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,650
哦，我很抱歉。
Oh, I'm so sorry.

304
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,985
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

305
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:03,189
呃,我…嗯…我的门开着。
Uh, I... Um... My door was open.

306
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:09,195
我没有打开它，我…你……我不知道你醒了没有，你一直在制造噪音，然后…我在制造噪音?
And I didn't open it, and I... You... And I didn't know if you were up, and you were, like, making noises and... I was making noise?

307
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,831
我很……我很抱歉。
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

308
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:15,334
我要…我不打扰你睡觉了。
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna let you go to sleep.

309
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,103
你吓死我了。
You scared the shit out of me.

310
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,672
你打开我的门了吗?
Did you open my door?

311
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,072
不!
No!

312
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,543
是的。
Yeah.

313
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,351
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

314
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,574
大便。
Shit.

315
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,377
基思?
Keith?

316
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,224
苔丝?
Tess?

317
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,293
哦。
Oh.

318
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,962
你好,凯瑟琳!这就跟你问声好！
Hi, Catherine! Hi!

319
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,397
见到你真高兴!我也很高兴见到你。
So nice to meet you! Nice to meet you, too.

320
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,975
谢谢你大老远赶过来。
Thanks for making the trip all the way out here.

321
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,000
是的。
Yeah.

322
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,515
那你来城里的时候住哪?
So, where are you staying while you're in town?

323
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,151
Airbnb哦。哦,那很好。的下落吗?
Oh, an Airbnb. Oh, that's nice. Whereabouts?

324
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,954
在布莱特摩尔。
Uh, it's in Brightmoor.

325
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,189
你知道在哪里吗?
You know where that is?

326
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,991
什么?
What?

327
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,626
是的。你知道吗?
Yeah. You know it?

328
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,494
你在开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

329
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:33,766
嗯,我的意思是……看起来有点粗糙，但是…不，你不应该在那里。
Well, I mean... It seems a little rough, but... No, you shouldn't be there.

330
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,970
你是什么意思?这不是……在Brightmoor租Airbnb ?
What do you mean? That's not... An Airbnb in Brightmoor?

331
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:46,411
是的，我是说，就像…这是一个可爱的小房子，但是…是啊，我想这附近有点…苔丝。
Yeah, I mean, like... It's a cute little house, but... Yeah, I suppose the neighborhood is a little... Tess.

332
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:50,983
我试着找过别的地方，但城里有个大会什么的?
Well, I did try and find somewhere else, but there's, like, a convention in town or something?

333
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:56,188
我有个室友，所以…这有点复杂。
And I have a roommate, so... It's a little complicated.

334
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:57,857
我猜。
I guess.

335
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,959
好吧，小心点，好吗?
Okay, well, just be careful, okay?

336
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,929
认真对待。我会的。
Seriously. I will.

337
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,296
我…我是艰难的。
I'm... I'm tough.

338
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,833
很好。嗯…很高兴认识你。
Good. Well... It was really nice to meet you.

339
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,035
是啊!不,我很兴奋。
Yeah! No, I'm excited.

340
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,408
我明天打给你，好吗?这会很棒的。
I'm gonna call you tomorrow, okay? This is gonna be great.

341
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,768
嘿!
Hey!

342
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:18,938
嘿,小女孩!
Hey, little girl!

343
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,643
嘿!
Hey!

344
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,280
来这里!
Come here!

345
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:32,885
嘿,小女孩!
Hey, little girl!

346
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,486
从那房子里出来!
Come out that house!

347
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,587
走开!
Go away!

348
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,957
从那房子里出来!
Come out that house!

349
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,364
是的!
Yes!

350
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,834
我不知道…我不能再见他了。
I don't know what... I can't see him anymore.

351
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,001
他离开了吗?
He left?

352
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:51,704
我不知道!
I don't know!

353
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,505
你能派个人来吗?
Can you just send someone, please?

354
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:56,175
我们现在没有空房。
We don't have any available units at the moment.

355
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,311
什么?所以没人要来吗?太太,冷静下来。
What? So nobody's coming? Ma'am, calm down.

356
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:02,481
就像我说的，我们没有任何可用的单位…
As I said, we don't have any available units at this...

357
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:21,993
大便。
Shit.

358
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,478
他妈的。
Fuck.

359
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:10,669
不。
Nope.

360
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,178
基思!
Keith!

361
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,480
基思!
Keith!

362
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,516
基思!
Keith!

363
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,886
什么他妈的!
What the fuck!

364
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,055
我…我被困在这里了。
I'm... I'm stuck down here.

365
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,956
你有钥匙吗?
Uh, do you have the key?

366
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:46,425
就在这里，但我打不开!
It's here, but I can't open this!

367
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,559
好吧。
All right.

368
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,162
在这里。
Right here.

369
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,565
好吧，你拉我推。好吧。
Okay, you pull and I push. Okay.

370
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,801
一个,两个,三个。
One, two, three.

371
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,305
好吧。
Okay.

372
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,207
你还好吗?我们现在就得走!
Are you okay? We need to go now!

373
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,118
你在说什么?你为什么在地下室?
What are you talking about? Why were you in the basement?

374
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:05,053
我被锁在地下室，然后有了一个隐藏区域!
I got locked in the basement, and then there was this hidden area!

375
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,178
有一个房间!
There was this room!

376
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:08,046
有个密室?
There's a hidden room?

377
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,915
这里发生了不好的事情!
There is something bad going on here!

378
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,683
苔丝!苔丝!放松点!放松。
Tess! Tess! Relax! Relax.

379
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,252
你没事了，你很安全。
You're okay, you're safe.

380
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,385
你很安全，好吗?
You're safe, all right?

381
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,721
你是安全的。好吧。
You're safe. Okay.

382
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,689
我不…我不这么认为。
I don't... I don't think I am.

383
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:22,694
下面是什么?你看到了什么?好吧……我在地下室。
What's down there? What did you see? Okay... I was in the basement.

384
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:24,463
然后我发现了一条隐藏的通道。
And then I found this hidden passageway.

385
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:28,100
有个房间，就像…像一个地牢。
And there was this room, and it was like a... Like a dungeon.

386
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,136
像一个地牢?里面是什么?
Like a dungeon? What was in there?

387
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,138
有一张床……好吧。
There was a bed... Okay.

388
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,274
还有一个照相机和一个水桶。
And a camera, and a bucket.

389
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:42,047
好的。呃，那么，有一张床和一个…什么，一个桶和一个照相机吗?是的。
All right. Uh, so, there's a bed and a... What, a bucket and a camera? Yeah.

390
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,101
我去看看。不，不，不，求你不要!
I'm just gonna go look. No, no, no, please don't!

391
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,693
墙上好像有个手印。
There was, like, a handprint on the wall.

392
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:46,918
苔丝，冷静，冷静。
Tess, calm down, calm down.

393
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:48,887
你在说什么，好吗?
You're not making any sense, okay?

394
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,291
楼下有个房间，里面有床和桶吗?
So, there's a room downstairs with a bed and a bucket in it?

395
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,127
这是一个地下室。里面都是垃圾，好吗?
It's a basement. It's filled with junk, okay?

396
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,495
听起来没那么奇怪。
It doesn't sound that weird.

397
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,097
如果你想去看，随你便，但我要去!
If you wanna go and look, suit yourself but I'm going!

398
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:00,932
现在好些了吗?是的。
Right now? Yes.

399
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,070
好了，苔丝，不不不。停止,停止,停止!
All right, Tess, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop!

400
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,238
只是停止,停止!
Just stop, stop!

401
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:07,539
动!就停止!
Move! Just stop!

402
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:08,953
能给我点时间吗?
Can you give me a moment, please?

403
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,942
能给我点时间吗?二十秒?
Can you just give me a moment? Twenty seconds?

404
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,746
好吧，如果我看起来不像是把你看到的事当回事，我很抱歉。
Okay, I'm sorry if I don't seem like I'm taking whatever it is that you saw seriously.

405
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,415
我只是…我没看到。
I just... I didn't see it.

406
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,251
好吧?
Okay?

407
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:24,156
我不能因为楼下有个房间有床有桶就惊慌失措地跑掉!
And I can't just be running off in a panic because there's a room downstairs with a bed and a bucket!

408
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,161
苔丝?不,苔丝!苔丝，等等，对不起!
Tess? No, Tess! Tess, wait, I'm sorry!

409
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,663
我只是…我只是想看看。
I just... I just want to see it.

410
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,708
如果你不想的话，你可以不跟我去。
You don't even have to come with me if you don't want to.

411
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,876
我不会再下去了。
I'm not going back down there.

412
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,901
这很好。
That's fine.

413
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,403
这很好。
That's fine.

414
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:45,277
你能…你能在上面等着吗以防我也被锁在里面?
Can you just... Can you just wait up here in case I get locked inside, too?

415
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,981
你能吗?
Can you?

416
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:53,519
我将等待。
I'll wait.

417
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:59,225
就30秒，好吗?就在这里等。
Just 30 seconds, okay? Just wait here.

418
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,357
你看到了吗?
Do you see it?

419
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,326
是的。
Yeah.

420
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,094
好吧，现在上来吧。
Okay, well, come back up now.

421
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,501
基思?
Keith?

422
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,712
基思?
Keith?

423
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:18,870
基思!
Keith!

424
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,499
基思?
Keith?

425
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,371
基思?
Keith?

426
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,344
基思?
Keith?

427
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,881
苔丝!
Tess!

428
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,484
基思!
Keith!

429
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,221
的帮助!
Help!

430
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,857
上来吧，基思!
Come up here, Keith!

431
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,493
帮帮我!
Help me!

432
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,063
拜托!
Please!

433
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,042
拜托!
Please!

434
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,476
基思!
Keith!

435
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,238
嘿!
Hey!

436
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,586
基思!
Keith!

437
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,059
回答我,基思!
Answer me, Keith!

438
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,645
苔丝……基思!基思!基思!
Tess... Keith! Keith! Keith!

439
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,183
你为什么到这儿来?
Why did you come down here?

440
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,785
下面还有别人。不,为什么?
Someone else is down here. No, why?

441
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:03,622
你为什么到这儿来?有人……下面还有别人。
Why did you come down here? There's someone... Someone else is down here.

442
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:04,755
什么?
What?

443
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,491
有人咬了我。
Someone bit me.

444
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,395
好的。好的。我们得走了。
Okay. Okay. We need to go.

445
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,664
我们得离开这里!不，不要靠近那里。
We need to get out of here! No, don't go near there.

446
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:15,200
他们就在那里!不，那是出去的路!
That's where they were! No, that's the way out!

447
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,502
从这边回来。不，求你了，别说了!
Come back this way. No, please, stop it!

448
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:18,770
这边走!停止它!
Come this way! Stop it!

449
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,281
我们必须走这条路!放开我!
We have to come this way! Let go off me!

450
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:22,016
我们必须走这条路!这就是出路!
We have to come this way! That's the way out!

451
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,408
别人的了……请停止!
Someone's down... Please stop!

452
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,845
我不会回去的!我不会…
I'm not going back there! I'm not going...

453

458
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,881
嘿,AJ。大卫·斯特恩和梅丽莎·赫伯特找你。
Hey, AJ. I have David Stern and Melissa Herberts for you.

459
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:51,996
爱死它了。
Love it.

460
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:54,565
伙计们，你们和AJ连线。
Guys, you're on with AJ.

461
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,134
-哟，怎么了?——嗨,AJ。
- Yo, what's up? - Hi, AJ.

462
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,838
嘿,AJ。我们得谈谈刚刚发生的事。
Hey, AJ. Uh, we need to discuss something that's just come through.

463
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,372
酷。有什么事吗?
Cool. What's up?

464
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:06,277
这是一个有点尴尬的对话，但有一个令人不安的进展。
So this is a bit of an awkward conversation, but there's been a troubling development.

465
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,681
好吧,什么?
Okay, what?

466
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:16,054
显然，梅根·马多克斯通过她的律师联系了电视台她对你提出了非常严重的指控。
Apparently, Megan Maddox has contacted the network through her lawyer and she's made a very serious accusation against you.

467
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,557
真的吗?她怎么说的?
Really? What'd she say?

468
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:26,798
她声称在拍摄试播集时你对她进行性侵犯，如果你被牵扯进来她就不想继续下去了。
She's claimed that you were sexually aggressive during the filming of the pilot, and she no longer wants to move forward if you're involved.

469
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,368
她……什么?
She... What?

470
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,304
电视台非常重视这件事。
The network is taking this very seriously.

471
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:35,006
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

472
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,318
也就是说，现在他们要开始调查了。
That means that at this time, they're gonna start an investigation.

473
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,144
等等,等等,等等。飞行员呢?
Wait, wait, wait. What about the pilot?

474
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,312
等一等。等一下。这是疯狂的。
Hold on. Wait a minute. This is crazy.

475
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:43,148
我们不接了吗?
So, are we not picked up anymore?

476
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:48,186
就像我说的，他们会进行调查，然后决定如何进行。
Well, like I said, they're going to conduct an investigation, and then decide how to proceed.

477
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,888
一个调查吗?
An investigation?

478
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:54,501
AJ，说实话，我认为这一切最有可能的结果是，即使这部剧继续下去……是吗?
AJ, I think, honestly, the most likely outcome of all of this is that even if the show does go forward... Yeah?

479
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,627
你不太可能被牵扯进来。
It's very unlikely that you will be involved.

480
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:57,829
不。
No.

481
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,530
我解雇了?
I'm fired?

482
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:02,033
我认为，基本上，这是最有可能的结果。
I think, essentially, that's the most likely outcome.

483
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:05,203
他妈的,婊子。
That fuckin' bitch.

484
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,637
哦,我的上帝。哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

485
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,115
等一下，伙计们。等等,等等,等等。
Wait a minute, you guys. Wait, wait, wait.

486
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,742
这完全是小题大做。
This is totally blown out of proportion.

487
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:14,780
好吧，我觉得有必要说一声你不太愿意谈这个电话的细节。
Okay, I think it's important to say that it's not in your best interest to go into details on this call.

488
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:16,381
你他妈什么意思，梅丽莎?
The fuck does that mean, Melissa?

489
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:20,218
好吧，AJ，我觉得你需要冷静下来，伙计。你可以放松一下。
Okay, AJ, I think you just need to calm down, honestly, buddy. You can just relax.

490
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,387
这不可能是真的。就这样，我出局了?
This can't be real. Just like that, I'm out?

491
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,122
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you fucking kidding?

492
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,291
我是第一个爱上它的人!
I was the first to be attached to that!

493
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:27,926
她追上了我!
She came on after me!

494
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,394
好吧,我……我推荐她。
Okay, I... I recommended her.

495
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,372
AJ，说实话，我觉得你需要冷静下来。
AJ, I think, honestly, you just need to calm down.

496
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,874
大卫，我觉得我们应该告诉他另一件事。
David, I think we should tell him the other thing.

497
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:36,267
不，我觉得他现在需要冷静一下……其他什么?其他什么?
No, I think right now he just needs to cool down... What other? What other?

498
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,241
这不重要，AJ。你只需要放松。
It's not important, AJ. You just have to relax.

499
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:41,439
不，不，不，去他妈的。其他什么?还有什么?
No, no, no, fuck that. What other? What else?

500
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,642
明天的《好莱坞报道》会有一篇关于这件事的报道。
There is gonna be a story tomorrow in the Hollywood Reporter about this.

501
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,878
关于什么?关于我的吗?
About what? About me?

502
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:48,079
你在开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

503
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,816
这些指控非常严重。
The allegations are very serious.

504
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,384
哟……她说我做了什么?
Yo... What's she saying I did?

505
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,887
她是说我强奸了她吗?
Is she saying I raped her or something?

506
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,398
AJ，你冷静一下，好吗?
AJ, why don't you just calm down, okay?

507
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,457
不。她到底在说什么?
No. What the fuck is she saying?

508
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,260
是的。她说你强奸了她。
Yes. She's saying that you raped her.

509
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,967
AJ，你在吗?
AJ, are you there?

510
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,036
我再打给你。
I gotta call you back.

511
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:34,826
假设这一年的收入是年底的收入。
So, let's assume that the income we have for the year is what we're gonna have at year's end.

512
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,427
没有新的资金流入。
No new money coming in.

513
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:37,896
我觉得这么说很安全。
I think that's pretty safe to say.

514
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,998
你预计你的法律费用是多少?
What do you anticipate your legal expenses to be?

515
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,835
我和我的律师谈过了，我们现在面对的是两个不同的案子。
So, I talked it over with my lawyer, and, um, we're looking at two separate cases here.

516
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:50,108
还有对指控的辩护，顺便说一句，这100%都不是真的。
There's the defense against the charge, which is 100% not true, by the way.

517
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:55,146
有了这个，还有诽谤罪的反诉，我百分之百会赢。
So, there's that, and then there's the countersuit for defamation, which I'm 100% gonna win.

518
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,282
我要毁了这婊子。
I'm gonna ruin this fuckin' bitch.

519
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,118
多少钱?
How much?

520
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,921
他们说大概每个人要七万左右。
They said it's probably gonna be, like, around 70,000 each.

521
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,689
所以,140000。
So, 140,000.

522
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,126
这对我有什么影响?
What does that do to me?

523
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:14,932
按照你现在的消费速度，你的收入将为零……三个月。
Well, with your current rate of spending, that's gonna put you at zero in... Three months.

524
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,534
哦,操我。
Oh, fuck me.

525
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,303
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

526
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:24,447
你从你在密歇根的房产中获得了一些收入…但你在这里的抵押贷款要了你的命。
You've got some small income from your Michigan properties... But it's your mortgage here that's killing you.

527
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,845
你是说我得把房子卖了吗?
Are you saying I have to sell my house?

528
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,024
我是说你得做一些艰难的选择。
I'm saying you're gonna have to make some tough choices.

529
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,325
我可以卖掉密歇根的房产。
I could sell the Michigan properties.

530
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,589
有些是赚钱的，对吧?
Some of those make money, right?

531
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,719
是的，但有些人没有。你可以把它们卖了。
Yeah, but some don't. You could sell those.

532
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,956
给自己争取点时间。但不会超过几个月。
Buy yourself some time. But no more than a couple of months.

533
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:39,690
这些都不是真正的热门地产。
Those aren't exactly hot properties.

534
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:41,359
我真他妈不敢相信。
I can't fuckin' believe this.

535
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:43,494
这是坚果。
This is nuts.

536
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,797
听着，AJ，我得告诉你。
Listen, AJ, I gotta tell ya.

537
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:48,666
什么?
What?

538
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,119
这周末，我会把文件还给你。
At the end of this week, I'm gonna give you your files back.

539
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:52,636
酷。那是什么意思?
Cool. What's that mean?

540
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:57,275
我建议你选择另类财富管理。
I'm going to suggest that you find alternate wealth management.

541
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,113
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

542
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:03,514
你也要甩了我?
You're dropping me, too?

543
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,928
哦,操我。
Oh, fuck me.

544
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,698
他妈的。
Fuck.

545
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,468
AJ Gilbride找Robert。
It's AJ Gilbride for Robert.

546
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,904
Gilbride。谢谢你！
Gilbride. Thank you.

547
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,308
罗伯特,你好啊。
Robert, hey.

548
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:32,643
你看到那篇文章了吗?
You see the article?

549
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,713
哦,是。是的,疯狂的。
Oh, it's out. Yeah, insane.

550
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:40,285
感觉我就像坐在场边，看着事情失去控制。
Feel like I'm sittin' on the sideline, just watching this thing spiral out of control.

551
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,662
罗伯特,坚持下去。等等,等等,等等。
Robert, hang on. Wait, wait, wait.

552
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:42,997
我把免提开了。
I'm just gonna put you on speaker.

553
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,255
坐进租来的车里。等一等。
Getting in a rental. Hold on.

554
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,061
你听到我吗?
You hear me?

555
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:51,629
我听到你。
I hear you.

556
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:58,936
我只是想说，如果我能和她谈谈，我也许能把这事扼杀在摇篮里。
Uh, I was just saying, if I could just have, like, a conversation with her, I could probably nip this whole thing in the bud.

557
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,438
绝对不是。
Absolutely not.

558
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:03,141
你在任何情况下都不能联系她。
Under no circumstances are you to contact her.

559
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:08,379
如果我打电话给她，说…听我的。
If I just call her and just be like... Listen to me.

560
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:13,551
在这个时候，你给她打电话除了给你带来更多麻烦外，不会有任何结果。
There's zero chance, at this point, that you calling her is gonna bring about anything but more problems for you.

561
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,220
你听到了吗?嗯。嗯。
Do you hear me? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

562
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:18,489
从现在起任何沟通都要通过我们…等待,我很抱歉。
Any communication goes through us from now on... Wait, I'm sorry.

563
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,334
你说你要租房子是什么意思?租金多少?
What do you mean you're getting into the rental? What rental?

564
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:23,194
我在底特律。我租了一辆车。
Uh, I'm in Detroit. I rented a car.

565
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:25,296
你在密歇根州的底特律?
You're in Detroit, Michigan?

566
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:29,000
是的。什么?
Yeah. What?

567
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,136
AJ，你不能离开这个州。
AJ, you aren't supposed to leave the state.

568
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,504
为什么不呢?我没有被捕。
Why not? I'm not under arrest.

569
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:34,805
我被允许旅行。
I'm allowed to travel.

570
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:35,973
这是不可取的。
This is not advisable.

571
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:39,244
你真的需要待在这里以防事态发展。
You really need to be here in case there are developments.

572
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:40,511
“发展?”
"Developments?"

573
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,982
你觉得他们会逮捕我吗?
You think they're gonna arrest me?

574
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,118
我认为这是一个非常明显的可能性。
I think that is a very distinct possibility.

575
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:51,622
我觉得现在飞到另一个州不太好看。
I think that flying off to another state is not a good look right now.

576
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:59,964
罗伯特，我不知道该怎么说，但是，除非你打算无偿帮我，否则我得先凑点钱了。
Well, Robert, I don't know how to say this, but, um, unless you plan on taking me on pro bono, uh, I'm gonna have to scrape up some money.

577
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,200
你知道，我不是在潜逃。
You know, I'm not here on the lam.

578
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,335
我不是来度假的。
I'm not here on vacation.

579
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:07,872
我是来清算的。
I'm here to do some fucking liquidating.

580
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,153
我能为您效劳吗?
May I help you?

581
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:23,997
是的，我是老板。我是来取钥匙的。
Yeah, I'm an owner. I'm here to pick up a set of keys.

582
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,022
的名字吗?
Name?

583
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,658
AJ Gilbride。
AJ Gilbride.

584
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,660
哦,是的。邦妮说你会来的
Oh, yeah. Bonnie said you'd be coming.

585
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:30,828
嗯…
Um...

586
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:35,900
476巴巴里。
476 Barbary.

587
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:05,796
他妈的。
Fuck.

588
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,087
他妈的?
The fuck?

589
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,931
这他妈的是什么?
Fucking shit is this?

590
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,943
他妈的,伙计?
The fuck, dude?

591
00:51:58,649 --> 00:51:59,650
喂?
Hello?

592
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,396
大韦恩物业管理公司。
Greater Wayne Property Management.

593
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,420
嘿。是的,是的。
Hey. Yeah, yeah.

594
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:04,789
邦妮,AJ。
Bonnie, it's AJ.

595
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:05,923
AJ吗?
AJ?

596
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:11,462
Gilbride从…哦,AJ。你好。正确的。嗯…现在有人住在这里吗?
Gilbride from... Oh, AJ. Hi. Right. Um... Is someone staying here at the moment?

597
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:12,663
我不这么想。
I don't think so.

598
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,165
哦,有人来了。
Well, someone's here.

599
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:18,269
有个手提箱，衣服，还有东西。
There's a suitcase, and clothes, and shit.

600
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,738
是的,没有。人们呆在这里。
Yeah, no. People are staying here.

601
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:25,476
我不…我的意思是……我们已经有几周没租出去了。
I don't... I mean... We haven't rented it out in a couple of weeks.

602
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,946
知道最后一批房客什么时候退房吗?
Well, do we know when the last tenants checked out?

603
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:35,162
我有擅自占用的人吗?这个…你是说自从上一批房客之后就没人来看过这里了吗?
Do I have squatters? This... I mean, are you saying that no one's come by to look at this place since the last tenants?

604
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,488
没有女佣之类的吗?
Like, no maid or anything?

605
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:40,991
在下一批房客到来之前，女佣们来收拾房子。
The maids come to prep the houses before the arrival of the next tenants.

606
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,160
没有新房客，没有佣人服务。
No new renters, no maid service.

607
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:45,134
这是坚果。如果有人把这地方搞砸了呢?
That's nuts. What if somebody trashed the place?

608
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,464
如何……我怎么知道?
How... How would I know?

609
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,933
这地方被毁了吗?
Is the place trashed?

610
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,501
不,邦妮。这地方没有被毁。
No, Bonnie. The place isn't trashed.

611
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:54,339
这不是重点。重点是…这是什么制度?这是他妈的白痴。
That's not the point. The point is it's... What kind of system is that? It's fucking idiotic.

612
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:55,882
我也不知道你为什么这么冷静。
I also don't know why you're so calm.

613
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:56,974
祝您有愉快的一天。
Have a nice day.

614
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,043
到底是谁住在我家里?
So, who the fuck is staying in my house?

615
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:00,845
喂?
Hello?

616
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,518
伙计。
Dude.

617
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,222
AJ，我听不到。
AJ, I can't hear you.

618
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,491
听起来就像你在赛车里。
It sounds like you're in a racecar.

619
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:14,992
我正在洗脸。
I'm washing my face.

620
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,126
什么?
What?

621
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:18,062
我正在洗脸。
I'm washing my face.

622
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,030
你能别说了吗?
Well, could you stop, please?

623
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,266
快乐吗?
Happy?

624
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,468
我当然不高兴了。
Of course I'm not happy.

625
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:25,503
我不知道该怎么跟别人说。
I don't know what to tell people.

626
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:26,871
你想让我们说什么?
What do you want us to say?

627
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:28,239
我不知道，妈妈。
I don't know, Mom.

628
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,040
就说她是个撒谎的婊子。
Just say she's a lying fuckin' bitch.

629
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:32,377
哦,不说话…别这么说。
Oh, don't talk... Don't talk like that.

630
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,011
什么?她是。
What? She is.

631
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,046
这不是好。
That's not nice.

632
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,748
“不错,”真的吗?
"Nice," really?

633
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:41,386
毁掉我的事业和声誉也不是“好事”。
Ruining my career and reputation isn't "nice," either.

634
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,555
我想我完全有权利叫她“婊子”。
I think I'm well within my rights to call her a "fuckin' bitch."

635
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,023
我知道,亲爱的。
I know, sweetie.

636
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,759
我知道你不会做那些事。
I know you wouldn't do those things.

637
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,328
你什么时候回家?
When are you coming back home?

638
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,430
到底特律只要四个小时的飞机。
It's only a four-hour flight to Detroit.

639
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,299
你父亲和我想见你。
You father and I want to see you.

640
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,234
真的吗?爸爸要见我?
Really? Dad wants to see me?

641
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,504
他这么说的吗?
Did he say that?

642
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:04,809
你知道他是什么样的人。他只是……他心烦意乱。
Oh, you know how he is. He's just... He's upset.

643
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:07,211
妈，我得走了。我接到一个重要的工作电话。
Mom, I gotta go. I'm getting an important work call.

644
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:08,979
好吧,宝贝。我爱……
Okay, baby. I love...

645
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,384
了什么,同性恋?
What up, faggot?

646
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:14,719
猜猜谁回来了。
Guess who's back in town.

647
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:17,197
我们能不能，好好谈谈?
Could we just, like, real-talk for a moment, though?

648
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,499
我们可以real-talk吗?他妈的,是的,伙计。
Could we real-talk? Fuck, yeah, dude.

649
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:23,227
好吧，你俩到底发生了什么事?
Okay, like, just, what the fuck actually did happen with you guys?

650
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:25,563
不,伙计。我是说，很明显，你是我儿子。
No, dude. I'm saying, like, you're my boy, obviously.

651
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,216
你说什么我都相信。
I'm gonna believe whatever you tell me.

652
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,766
对的,正确的。我得听你说出来。
Right, right. I gotta hear you say it.

653
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,711
不，我知道，我知道。我感觉你。因为我看了那个网站。
No, I know, I know. I feel you. 'Cause I read the website.

654
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:35,506
我知道网上怎么说，但是，男人对男人，真实的谈话，到底发生了什么?
I know what the fuckin' Internet says, but, like, man-to-man, real-talk, what the fuck actually happened?

655
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,960
哥们，我跟你说实话，好吗?
Dude, I'll be real with you, okay?

656
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,953
这是我唯一的要求。唷，唷，让我…这是我唯一的要求。让我跟你说实话吧。
That's all I'm asking for. Yo, yo, let me be... That's the only thing I'm asking. Let me be real with you.

657
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,780
我们受骗的。我们做了操。好吧?正确的。
We fucked. We did fuck. Okay? Right.

658
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:45,082
她只是被说服了，仅此而已。就是这样。
She just took some convincing, is all. That's it.

659
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,793
好吧，但这他妈是什么意思?
Okay, but what the fuck does that mean, though?

660
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,786
我是说，她是不是…她拒绝了吗?
Like, I mean, was she like... Did she say no?

661

别担心,好吗?
Don't worry, okay?

935
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,446
很快就会有他妈的警察蜂拥而至。
There are gonna be fucking cops swarmin' this place real fuckin' soon.

936
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,471
相信我,男人。
Trust me, man.

937
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:36,379
你想要什么?你还要点别的吗?
What do you want? You want somethin' else?

938
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,217
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're sayin'.

939
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,386
你在说什么?你想要什么?
What are you saying? What do you want?

940
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,055
这是垃圾。
Well, this is trash.

941
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,456
我不知道你想要什么
I don't know what you want.

942
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:49,825
伙计，你知道吗?
Man, you know what?

943
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,328
好的。这是怎么回事?
Okay. How's that?

944
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:55,631
是的。就在这里，好吗?
Yeah. This right here, okay?

945
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,004
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're saying.

946
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:01,370
我的手机呢?
Where's my goddamn phone?

947
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,559
你……你得把这个打开。
You're... You're gonna have to get this open.

948
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,552
女士。
Ma'am.

949
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:18,130
如果你没有钥匙，你就不能住在这里。
If you don't have keys, you don't live here.

950
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:19,955
我们不进去了。但是把它分解一下。
We're not goin' in. But just break it down.

951
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:21,166
有人被困在里面了。
There's someone trapped in there.

952
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,625
来吧!嘿,嘿。
Come on! Hey, hey.

953
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,960
你在干什么?离开那里。得到下面。
What are you doin'? Get away from there. Get down here.

954
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:27,062
你能…你能听到我在说什么吗?
Can you... Can you hear what I'm saying?

955
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:28,464
这是犯罪现场。
This is a crime scene.

956
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:32,768
她已经杀了一个人了，下面可能正在有人被谋杀。
She has killed a man already, and there could be someone down there getting murdered right now.

957
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,737
女士，这栋楼里没人。
Ma'am, there's no one in this building.

958
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:36,572
没人会被谋杀。
No one's being murdered.

959
01:24:36,705 --> 01:24:39,442
到目前为止我看到的唯一的犯罪就是你打破了这扇窗户。
And the only crime that I've seen so far is you breaking this window.

960
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:42,111
我该说什么才能让你听我的?
What am I supposed to say to get you to listen to me?

961
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,046
-说真的，搞什么鬼?——嘿,马特?
- Seriously, what the fuck? - Hey, Matt?

962
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,714
米德兰有人开枪。
We got shots fired on Midland.

963
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:50,419
等待,等待。等待。
Wait, wait. Wait.

964
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:52,855
你们这些混蛋要走了吗?嘿!
Are you motherfuckers leaving? Hey!

965
01:24:52,988 --> 01:24:54,523
我受够你了。
I've had enough of you.

966
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:57,257
你该庆幸我们没把你带到城里让你在监狱里睡一觉。
You're lucky we don't bring you downtown to sleep this off in jail.

967
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:58,427
睡了吗?
Sleep this off?

968
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:00,321
你他妈开什么玩笑?乔伊,让我们移动。
Are you fucking kidding me? Joey, let's move.

969
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:02,898
Wh……你要去哪里?
Wh... Where are you going?

970
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:05,368
在那里……你要去哪里?
Where... Where are you going?

971
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:12,675
来吧,请…求你了，求你了，别走!只是…来吧!我需要你的帮助，拜托了!
Come on, please... Please, please, don't go! Just... Come on! I need your help, please!

972
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,477
嘿!
Hey!

973
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:16,445
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

974
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:27,483
你怎么了?
What is wrong with you?

975
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,521
你他妈有毛病吗?
The fuck is wrong with you?

976
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:35,157
嘿!
Hey!

977
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:37,192
我在跟你说话呢，你个混蛋!
Hey, I'm talking to you, you fuck!

978
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:44,667
嘿。嘿，嘿，嘿，好吧。
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, okay.

979
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:02,084
不。不，不，不，等等!等等!
No. No, no, no, wait! Wait!

980
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,373
来吧。
Come on.

981
01:28:50,593 --> 01:28:51,660
你好……
Hello...

982
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,135
哦,他妈的。哦,我的上帝。
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

983
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:01,837
哦,他妈的。我很抱歉。
Oh, fuck. I'm so sorry.

984
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,706
嘿。嘿,你能……好的。
Hey. Hey, can you... Okay.

985
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:06,509
好的。我很抱歉。
Okay. I'm so sorry.

986
01:29:06,642 --> 01:29:08,644
来吧。我们得把你弄出去。来吧。
Come on. We gotta get you outta here. Come on.

987
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:11,313
对不起，对不起，对不起!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

988
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,120
好吧,来吧。
Okay, come on.

989
01:29:20,122 --> 01:29:21,990
看来你的车坏了。
Looks like your car is fucked.

990
01:29:22,124 --> 01:29:23,392
她不在那里。什么?
She's not there. What?

991
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:25,594
她走了!
She's gone!

992
01:29:25,728 --> 01:29:27,506
她走了是什么意思?她他妈的在哪儿?
What do you mean she's gone? Where the fuck is she?

993
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,031
我不知道。
I don't know.

994
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:31,066
什么?我们该怎么办?
What? What are we gonna do?

995
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,402
你……你没有车?
Do you... You don't have a car?

996
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:34,946
是的，就在这里，但钥匙在隧道里。
Yeah, it's right here, but the keys are in the tunnel.

997
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,672
我才不要回到那破东西里去!
I'm not goin' back in that shit!

998
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:38,907
好的。我知道。我知道该去哪里。
Okay. I know. I know where to go.

999
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:42,545
在那里……好的。哦,他妈的。
Where... Okay. Oh, fuck.

1000
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:46,415
好的。
Okay.

1001
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:50,252
你还好吗?
How you holdin' up?

1002
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,620
我很好。
I'm okay.

1003
01:29:51,754 --> 01:29:54,022
好的。我想我们快成功了。
Okay. I think we're almost there.

1004
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:55,190
好的。
Okay.

1005
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:02,097
等等，这是什么地方?
Wait, what is this place?

1006
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,366
他一定在这附近。谁?
He's gotta be here somewhere. Who?

1007
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,701
嘿!
Hey!

1008
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:09,538
到这里来。
Come here.

1009
01:30:09,672 --> 01:30:11,406
来吧,男人。
Come on, man.

1010
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,509
到这里来。好的。
Come here. Okay.

1011
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:15,010
在这里。好的。
Right here. Okay.

1012
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:20,415
那么，发生了什么?
So, what happened there?

1013
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:25,153
你有干净的布或绷带或其他东西吗?
Do you have any clean cloth or bandages or anything?

1014
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:26,755
这里可不怎么干净。
Ain't much clean in here.

1015
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:29,992
真不敢相信她居然让你走到这一步。
I can't believe she let you get this far.

1016
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,461
她是什么东西?
What the fuck is she?

1017
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,963
她只是个住在那房子里的疯女人。
She's just a crazy lady livin' in that house.

1018
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:36,832
从什么时候开始?
Since when?

1019
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:39,468
她在那里住了40多年了。
She's been living there some 40 years now.

1020
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:40,602
她出生在那里。
She was born there.

1021
01:30:40,703 --> 01:30:41,743
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1022
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,405
那房子是我的。没有人住在那里。
I own that house. Nobody lives there.

1023
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:47,342
兄弟，报纸也许是你的，但那是她爸爸的房子。
Boy, you might own that paper, but that's her daddy's house.

1024
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:50,579
他从未离开过那里，她也从未离开过那里。
And he ain't never left there, and she never left there neither.

1025
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:52,314
他以前常带女人去那里。
He used to bring women down there.

1026
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,249
然后他开始和他们生孩子。
And then he started making babies with 'em.

1027
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:55,651
还有带着孩子的孩子。
And babies with the babies.

1028
01:30:55,784 --> 01:31:00,222
你复制一个副本，复制一个副本，最后得到这样的东西。
And you make a copy of a copy of a copy, and you end up with something like that.

1029
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:04,292
她狠狠揍了你一顿。
She got you real good.

1030
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:08,931
我这么做。
I did that.

1031
01:31:10,098 --> 01:31:11,233
这是个意外。
It was an accident.

1032
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,803
没关系。我们得找人帮你。
Doesn't matter. We gotta get you help.

1033
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:17,172
怎么才能帮到她?
Which way to get her help, huh?

1034
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,576
你们就坐在这等着。
Y'all need to just sit right here and wait.

1035
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:22,511
我…我不能那么做。这是我的错。
I... I can't do that. This is my fault.

1036
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:23,979
是谁的错并不重要。
It don't matter whose fault it is.

1037
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:25,614
它!我伤害了别人!
It does! I hurt somebody!

1038
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:29,217
这很重要。
That matters.

1039
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:33,722
我不知道我是不是坏人。
I don't know if I'm a bad person.

1040
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,891
但我可能是。
But I might be.

1041
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,960
我可能是个坏人。
I might be a bad person.

1042
01:31:39,628 --> 01:31:42,464
或许我…我是个好人，只是做了件坏事。
Or maybe I'm... I'm a good person who just did a bad thing.

1043
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,335
我不能……我无法改变我的所作所为。
I can't... I can't change what I've done.

1044
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:51,473
我可以试着修好它。
I can just try and fix it.

1045
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:54,376
这就是我要做的。
And that's what I'm gonna do.

1046
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,845
我会修好它的。
I'm gonna fix it.

1047
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:59,982
如果你出去把自己害死，对谁都没好处。
You ain't gonna do nobody no help if you go out there and get yourself killed.

1048
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:03,285
现在，在这里，我们很安全。
Now, right here, we're safe.

1049
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,065
她会挺过今晚的。
And she's gonna make it through the night.

1050
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:10,036
到了早上，我们再考虑带她进城的事。
Come morning time, then we can worry about takin' her to town.

1051
01:32:11,426 --> 01:32:13,061
你怎么知道她进不来?
How do you know she can't get in here?

1052
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:18,098
大便。我在这地方住了15年了，她从来没来过这个混蛋。
Shit. I've been livin' in this place more than 15 years, and she ain't never came in this motherfucker.

1053
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:32,246
狗屎!哦,狗屎!
Shit! Oh, shit!

1054
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,690
他妈的,他妈的,他妈的!
Shit, shit, shit!

1055
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,965
过不去那该死的铁丝网。
Can't get over the fuckin' barbed wire.

1056
01:33:02,044 --> 01:33:04,012
等待我!他妈的来吧!
Wait for me! Fucking come on!

1057
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,198
你的枪!
Your gun!

1058
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:25,033
哦。
Oh.

1059
01:33:29,004 --> 01:33:30,004
他妈的!
Fuck!

1060
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:33,909
没有地方可去。
There's nowhere to go.

1061
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,242
你他妈无处可去!
There's nowhere to fucking go!

1062
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,948
她想要我们，她会抓到我们的。
She wants us, she's gonna get us.

1063
01:33:40,082 --> 01:33:41,349
她不会罢休的。
She's never gonna stop.

1064
01:33:47,723 --> 01:33:48,791
我可以离开。
I can get away.

1065
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,978
但你得让她慢下来。
But you're gonna have to slow her down.

1066
01:33:52,761 --> 01:33:53,962
嘿!不 
Hey! Don't.

1067
01:33:54,096 --> 01:33:56,164
快来抱你的孩子!
Come get your baby!

1068
01:35:06,969 --> 01:35:08,536
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

1069
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:10,906
哦,我的上帝。哦,我的上帝。你还好吗?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1070
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:13,241
我很抱歉。我别无选择，你知道吗?

01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:17,045
她要杀了我们两个，然后…我没有时间思考。
She was gonna kill us both, and... I had no time to think.

1072

我他妈的惊慌失措。

我没有……我甚至都没有放手。你开始滑倒了。
I didn't... I didn't even let go. You started to slip.

01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:24,719
我无能为力。
There was nothin' I could do.

1075
01:35:24,853 --> 01:35:26,154
你懂的，对吧?好的。
You get it, right? Okay.

1076
01:35:26,288 --> 01:35:27,888
你……你会没事的。我明白了。
You're... You're gonna be okay. I gotcha.

1077
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:29,724
我拯救你。是的,你没事。
I'm saving you. Yeah, you're okay.

1078
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:17,039
爸-爸。
Ba-ba.

1079
01:36:23,578 --> 01:36:24,612
我不能。
I can't.

1080
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:32,988
我不能回去。
I can't go back.

1081
01:36:33,555 --> 01:36:34,589
Ba!

1082
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:36,058
我不能回去。
I can't go back.

1083
01:36:54,776 --> 01:36:56,311
婴儿。
Baby.
