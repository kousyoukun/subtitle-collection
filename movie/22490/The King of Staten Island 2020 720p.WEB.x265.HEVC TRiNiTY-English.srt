I'm waking, baking *

00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,173
* Drinking, contemplating *

16
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,175
* Ain't no such thing as Satan *

00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,736
Sorry. I'm sorry.

Get back!

-(coughing)
-(chatter continues over TV)

46
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,033
I love this movie.

47
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,203
They-they shot this
on Staten Island.

48
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,271
(alarm bell continues over TV)

49
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,872
-(gunshot)
-Whew! -Oh!

50
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,174
-Oh!
-Ooh, God!

51
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,175
-Awesome.
-Hell yeah.

52
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,510
-Ew!
-(groans)

53
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,777
OSCAR:
That's my shit.

54
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,413
This movie makes no sense.

55
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,416
Why-why would the government
make a purge legal?

56
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,919
-Clearly to let them blow off
some steam. Hello. -Yeah.

57
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,122
-That's why you go to the spa.
-Yeah. Or the therapist.

58
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,225
-Or get your nails done.
-SCOTT: Or...

59
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,360
Or murder some folks. Hmm?

60
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,229
I mean, come on, guys.
I-I brought Tara over

61
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,096
so that we could
get out of this basement.

62
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,598
Let's go out.
Let's go dancing.

63
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,734
-I love dancing.
-Let's do something.

64
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,968
We don't go out.

65
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,437
We don't dance.

66
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,239
-The Purge is not enough
for you? -KELSEY: No.

67
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,240
Does anybody else like dancing?

68
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,307
-I like it.
-TARA: Yes, me!

69
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,308
-You do?
-I love dancing.

70
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,543
Yes.

71
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,944
He loves--
He's a really good dancer.

72
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,646
What's your favorite move?

73
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,282
It's kind of like a shake.

74
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,816
-A shake? That's...
-I don't know.

75
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,386
I just do whatever
the m-music tells me to do.

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,455
There's nothing but douchebags
at these clubs.

77
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,122
-I love it here, man. It's safe.
-Oh, but, come on.

78
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,791
God, you just sit here all day,

79
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,793
-and then smoke weed
and jerk each other off. -Yeah.

80
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,127
That sounds amazing.

81
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,996
I've never been jerked off
by any of my friends.

82
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,231
Me, either.

83
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,566
I like your tattoos.

84
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,900
-I knew you would, right?
-Those are-- (gasps)

85
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,302
-Oh, my God. That...
-No, don't talk to him.

86
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,337
-He has, he has chlamydia.
-I had.

87
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,406
-Oh, my God.
-Had chlamydia.

88
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,507
-It's curable.
-And you introduced me to

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,741
the girl that gave me chlamydia,

90
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,009
so you basically
gave me chlamydia.

91
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,444
You assisted the chlamydia.

92
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,612
He doesn't have insurance.

93
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,746
-He can't get the meds.
-TARA: It's fine.

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,114
I act-- I actually did
some of those.

95
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,215
TARA:
You did?

96
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,584
You know I got to rep
the island.

97
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,118
-RICHIE: Hey. -Staten Island.
-TARA: Wow, Staten.

98
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,288
-S.I., you know.
-Yeah.

99
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,656
-Looks so good.
-Thank you.

100
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,458
-TARA: You have a bunch
of tattoos also. -Yeah.

101
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,093
-What is that date?
-Oh. -OSCAR: Ooh.

102
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,095
Uh, that's, uh, the date
my Dad died.

103
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,831
Oh, my God, your dad died?
I'm so sorry.

104
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,133
Don't be. It's fine.
It's totally cool.

105
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,435
-So, what happened?
-OSCAR: Ooh!

106
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,603
-KELSEY: Okay, you don't
need to ask. -No.

107
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,371
-No, no, no, no.
-Don't ask that.

108
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,372
It's kind of inappropriate.

109
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,673
Uh, he was a, he was a fireman.

110
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,675
So, he died in a fire.

111
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,811
Oh, my God.

112
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,314
-Yeah, we knew.
-Yeah, we knew.

113
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,881
-We don't like to talk about it.
-We knew.

114
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,483
OSCAR:
That's why we don't bring it up.

115
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,319
-Apologize to Scott.
-It's the right thing to do.

116
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,321
-You should say sorry.
-Apologize or get out.

117
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,055
It's not okay.

118
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,692
Scott, um, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

119
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,362
-that I asked about your tattoo.
-KELSEY: Yeah.

120
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,131
(laughter)

121
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,334
(laughs):
What?

122
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,535
KELSEY:
He doesn't care. It's fine.

123
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,769
-RICHIE: He doesn't care.
-Look at him.

124
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,538
-He's laughing so much.
-SCOTT: I don't care.

125
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,473
We talk about his dead dad
all the time.

126
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,908
(laughter)

127
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,977
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

128
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,178
Not your dad.

129
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,713
-(laughter)
-KELSEY: That's my favorite one.

130
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,315
Oh, my God, that's so funny.

131
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,850
We've made so many jokes
about it.

132
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,084
SCOTT (laughing):
Oh, my God, I don't even...

133
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,153
-I don't even miss him at all.
-TARA: So funny.

134
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,187
KELSEY:
Yeah.

135
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,122
(laughter dies down)

136
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,162
(panting) Oh!

137
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,330
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's pretty good.

138
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,398
Keep-keep doing that!
Keep doing that!

139
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,766
-Are-are you, are you happy?
-(moans)

140
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,768
Yes, yes, it's fucking great!
Keep going!

141
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,002
(moaning)

142
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,404
No, wait, d-d-- don't stop!

143
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,172
(moaning)

144
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,908
(panting)

145
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,110
Did you, um, did you,
did you come?

146
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,279
(laughs):
Well, yes.

147
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,381
Were you there?

148
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,182
(laughs):
Yeah, I did.

149
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,584
-Like, six times.
-Cool.

150
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,218
-Awesome.
-It was great.

151
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,920
-Did you?
-No, no, no.

152
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,423
But it's okay. I-I had fun.

153
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,791
I had fun back there.

154
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,359
(laughs):
Yeah.

155
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,761
You know, I feel bad
that you never do.

156
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,262
No, I-I do all the time.

157
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,699
I just-- you know, I don't put
on a Broadway show like you do.

158
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,100
You know, I'm-I'm more quiet.

159
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,935
I'm more like Charlie Chaplin
when I come.

160
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,404
-Like a silent movie.
-Silent movie.

161
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,439
(laughs)

162
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,941
Um, do you think
it's the antidepressants?

163
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,543
Oh, yeah, for sure.

164
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,111
Yeah. If I didn't have
the antidepressants,

165
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,546
I'd come in, like,
eight seconds.

166
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,747
And then you wouldn't come.

167
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,382
And then you'd be depressed.

168
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,851
And then you would
have to take antidepressants.

169
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,988
-I don't know, can I say
something? I, um... -Yeah.

170
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,992
I just still don't understand
why this is such a big secret.

171
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,995
You know why it's a big secret.
'Cause it's special.

172
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,498
It's-it's, like, our thing,
you know?

173
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:08,135
It-it wouldn't be special
if everybody knew about it.

174
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,572
Yeah, but I don't
just want to do this.

175
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,774
Yeah, I totally get that.
So, should we stop?

176
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,108
No, I...

177
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,279
I don't know, like, this--
like, what is this?

178
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,848
-And I don't know why...
-This?

179
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,850
-This is... -I want to do
what normal people do.

180
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,452
Yeah, I know.
I just, you know, I--

181
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,986
It-it might be weird, you know.

182
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,955
We've known each other
for, like, ever.

183
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,156
Since fourth grade.

184
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,858
It would be like incest.

185
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,025
(laughs):
No, it wouldn't.

186
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,494
No, it's like, yeah,
w-we're best pals,

187
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,696
and I wouldn't want to, like,
jeopardize our friendship

188
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,666
or something like that
over something--

189
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,269
not silly, but, you know,
it's just-- it's a big risk.

190
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,204
But we've already
done the deed.

191
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,440
-I mean, what else is there?
-"Done the deed"?

192
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,509
-(laughs): I don't know.
-But, you know, it's just,

193
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,211
-you deserve somebody
way better than me. -What?

194
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,280
(chuckles):
You're a good guy.

195
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,115
-You're a good guy. I like you.
-Uh...

196
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,517
Well, I-- Based on what?

197
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,119
I mean, I like you, too.
It's just like...

198
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,988
(sighs)

199
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,190
All right, can I just tell you--
can I tell you something?

200
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,025
But can you, like,
not tell anybody?

201
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,328
Well, people probably know,
but, like... (sighs)

202
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,397
There's, like,
something wrong with me.

203
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,800
-Like, mentally, like...
-What?

204
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,903
Like, I'm not okay up there.

205
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,005
You know? Like...

206
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,340
I-I get all mad,
acting, like, crazy,

207
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,644
and I, and I make really insane,
impulsive decisions.

208
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,345
And I get...

209
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,517
I'm d-- I'm scared o-of myself,
and I don't...

210
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,519
I don't want to,
like, scare you or me

211
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,153
or, like, hurt anyone, you know?

212
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,322
So, I think
it would just be best

213
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,059
and really responsible of me
if I just backed off, you know?

214
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,664
I don't want you to f-feel
like that about yourself.

215
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,499
Oh, no, it's...

216
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,101
I just, I just don't want
to offend you, you know?

217
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:51,204
You're... you're the best.
I think you're the greatest.

218
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,874
I know you think I'm great.
I'm awesome.

219
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,011
I feel bad that you don't
think you're great.

220
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,815
(alarm beeping)

221
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,020
(sighs)

222
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,929
(exhales)

223
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,443
Hey, honey.

224
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,113
I made you an omelet.

225
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,417
What are you gonna wear to
your sister's graduation party?

226
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,221
I was thinking, what about
one of your dad's suits?

227
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,556
I don't know.

228
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,392
I-I don't think I'm really
a suit guy, you know?

229
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,828
Plus-plus, all those suits
are out of style, so...

230
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,831
You know, I thought
they were back in style.

231
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,768
And... can you not smoke pot
before the party?

232
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,103
Why?

233
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,138
Because it smells.
You smell bad.

234
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,140
And no vaping because
they're gonna think it's pot.

235
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,308
The uncle is a cop.

236
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,810
We don't need
that kind of trouble.

237
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,344
Fuck that guy.

238
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,279
I hate this family.

239
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,782
They're so rich and snooty.

240
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,651
They've been really nice
to Claire.

241
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,352
Hey, Mom. You got me
the plastic containers.

242
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,454
I just need the cardboard boxes
I can throw away.

243
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,657
But they're so good
for storing things.

244
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,491
Yeah, but I don't have
any storage.

245
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,427
-My closet's, like,
two feet wide. -(Margie groans)

246
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,530
Hey, Claire, do you even want me
at your graduation party?

247
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,333
Do I want you to go?
I don't care.

248
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,136
Just-- It's weird
if you don't go.

249
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,638
That wasn't exactly
a warm invitation.

250
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,505
Yeah, well, it's not the part
I'm looking forward to most.

251
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,141
But I want you to be there.

252
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,109
-MARGIE: She wants you to go.
-SCOTT: No, she doesn't.

253
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,978
-She just said it. -CLAIRE:
No, I don't want him to go.

254
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,513
He has to go.

255
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,016
Just don't sit on the couch
in the corner the whole time.

256
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,517
-It's weird. -SCOTT:
No, I don't see the problem

257
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:45,853
with sitting
in the corner, okay?

258
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,788
There's some people
that go to the party and dance,

259
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,657
and there's some people
that sit in the corner.

260
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,658
I'm the corner guy.

261
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,060
Accept your brother.

262
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,295
Also, don't try
to fuck Layla, okay?

263
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,964
She told you
she's not interested.

264
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,465
What are you talking about?

265
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,133
I never tried
to hook up with her.

266
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,870
She's always trying to fuck me,
and I-I have to avoid it

267
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,674
at all costs,
out of respect for you.

268
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,142
I just thought she looked
really good in those pants.

269
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,144
-Jesus. -Thought that was
a nice thing to say.

270
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,681
-Just don't. -I didn't know
I would get MeToo'd for it.

271
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,515
Dad's suits are vacuum-sealed
in the garage.

272
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,417
-Yeah?
-Just pick yourself a nice one.

273
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,986
You have to look nice.

274
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,221
We're celebrating
your sister's achievements.

275
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,556
You're gonna miss her
when she's gone.

276
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,393
Yeah. Celebrate me.

277
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,752
(sniffing)

278
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,562
(exhales, clears throat)

279
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,199
Wow, this, uh...
this all happened so fast.

280
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,335
I-I can't believe
you're graduating already.

281
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,707
I'm gonna really miss you.

282
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,214
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
Round two.

283
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,449
-Fight!
-(buttons clicking)

284
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,551
SCOTT:
Yo, where'd you get this?

285
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,619
This shit does not taste
very good.

286
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:29,322
What are you talking about?
This shit's fire, dawg.

287
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,224
Do you guys even really
get high anymore?

288
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,659
I-I don't really think
I get high anymore.

289
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,062
I think I just
kind of am myself.

290
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,930
I haven't been high
in a while, man.

291
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,465
But I still do it.

292
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,500
I like the lifestyle.

293
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,902
RICHIE:
I'm mad high.

294
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,670
OSCAR:
Yo, tell Scotty about

295
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,172
how you're being catfished.

296
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,239
-Who?
-You!

297
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,407
RICHIE:
How you're being catfished, bro.

298
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,475
Tell him the truth.

299
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,576
You got a girlfriend?
What's up?

300
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,677
-No.
-IGOR: Yeah.

301
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,145
-(chuckles): That's awesome.
-Yes.

302
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,613
-(Richie chuckles)
-Her name is Carla.

303
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,849
-We talk on the phone.
-RICHIE: Nah, dude.

304
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,585
Like, this girl, like,
slid into his DMs, and, like,

305
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,453
I don't know, she, like,
asked him out or whatever.

306
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,989
-But hundred percent a trick,
dude. -OSCAR: She...

307
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,623
-She's bad, but that's
not yours. -SCOTT: Why?

308
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,125
RICHIE:
And she's, like, so hot, dude.

309
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,127
Yo, she, like,
hangs out on yachts.

310
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,328
-Like, yo.
-Oh, come on.

311
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,797
-No, no, like, no.
-Dude...

312
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,964
Like, it's not real, like...

313
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,432
Bro, they're just
being jealous, bro.

314
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,801
They're just jealous
'cause you're getting that--

315
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,202
Oh, yeah, that's a catfish.

316
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,104
Oh, you getting catfished
like a motherfucker!

317
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,338
-Oh, my God!
-RICHIE: Right, dude?

318
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,973
-Bro...
-SCOTT: What does she...

319
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,342
Straight up, I'm-a send myself
this one, honestly.

320
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,045
Honestly, dude,
she's fucking fake.

321
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,814
She thinks I'm hot.

322
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,049
How? You guys never even
seen each other.

323
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,483
How come you guys
don't FaceTime?

324
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,385
Tell Scotty
why you don't FaceTime.

325
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,855
Her phone camera's broken, but
she sent me all these photos.

326
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,556
-RICHIE: Yeah. -OSCAR:
Bro, these are Google Images.

327
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,158
-RICHIE: Exactly, dude. -SCOTT:
Shit, you don't know that.

328
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,827
Maybe-maybe this girl is,
uh, is into Igor.

329
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,229
Well, you know,
he's-he's, you know, cute.

330
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,798
OSCAR: Yo, like, you don't even
know how to talk to girls.

331
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,399
What do you even
talk to her about?

332
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,534
(knocking on glass)

333
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,502
-OSCAR: Igor.
-IGOR: Mm-hmm.

334
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,239
Go get that shit, bro.
What are you doing?

335
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,241
Yo, he is the worst assistant.

336
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,542
SCOTT: He's clearly
going through a lot.

337
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,544
How much for, like, six Xanax?

338
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:58,745
Six.

339
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,547
What do we have?
What do we have?

340
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,050
-Who needs six Xanax?
-IGOR: I got one, two...

341
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,484
I got three right here, I think.

342
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,552
One, two...

343
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,754
Is this a... Yeah.

344
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,556
-How you doing?
-I'm all right.

345
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,025
Yo, you're Jimmy Bags' brother,
right?

346
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,661
-Yes, bro.
-(chuckles)

347
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,898
Tell your brother he's a bitch.

348
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,067
-You understand that?
-Yeah. I do.

349
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,402
-Say it back to me.
-He's a bitch. He's a bitch.

350
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,671
And now, you know what?

351
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,506
I got four,
but you're paying for six.

352
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,241
Nah, come on.
That's my fucking brother, bro.

353
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,776
-Like, what are you...
-Nah. Nah, dude.

354
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,011
I hate your brother.

355
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,846
And now you look like
a little version of him,

356
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,447
and I want to punch you
in the face.

357
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,250
So, instead of doing that,
just give me 60.

358
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,551
I only got 40.

359
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,220
Then go home, do chores,
and come back.

360
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,554
-I don't give a fuck.
-I-I can't.

361
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,091
I stole it from my mom's purse,
but she only had 40.

362
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,459
Well, then, give me your shoes.

363
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,061
No, bro, I can't.

364
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,462
OSCAR: Just give me your shoes
and we'll call it a day.

365
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,932
-Hey, what size are you?
-(scoffs) Like, a nine.

366
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,266
Those'll fit you.

367
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,634
-Igor, you can have those.
-IGOR: I'll take 'em.

368
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,869
OSCAR:
Look at that, Igor got a gift.

369
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,637
-He's not a fucking nine.
-Fuck you!

370
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,239
You don't make fun of my friend!

371
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,507
He-he can't get on
fucking roller coasters,

372
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,841
-he's that small.
-Shut the fuck up! -Whoa!

373
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,143
-We make fun of him!
-How is he gonna wear them?

374
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,711
-You don't make fun of him!
-He's our friend.

375
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,279
He rides roller coasters
all the time.

376
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,048
We make fun of him, not you.

377
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,549
He's, like, a size five,
bro, like...

378
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,717
Yo! Stop!

379
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,719
Get the fuck away
from my window.

380
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,721
You guys are a bunch
of fucking pussies.

381
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,324
Mom, he's saying he's gonna wear
these cargo shorts to the party.

382
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, no.

383
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,660
What? I told you
to wear Dad's suit.

384
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,662
I don't want to wear
Dad's old suit, okay?

385
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,797
-I have my own personal style,
and I... -Get the fuck off me!

386
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,067
-Don't do that! -I-I don't
want to wear a suit, okay?

387
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,802
-(arguing continues) -I think,
I think I'm gonna throw up.

388
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,838
I think I have the flu.

389
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,007
Oh, oh, okay. Just-just breathe
through your nose.

390
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,642
(breathing through nose)
One second.

391
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,144
Oh, shut up.
Mom, he looks like

392
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,979
he fucking sells crack
under a bridge.

393
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,348
I know the guy who sells crack
under the bridge, okay?

394
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,449
And he looks awesome.

395
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,751
Just put on the suit,
Scott, please.

396
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,953
No! It's not fair!

397
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,420
She thinks she's, like,
princess of the world...

398
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,588
Okay, well, then just please

399
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,756
be respectful for
two fucking seconds!

400
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,757
...because she graduated
high school.

401
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,759
Everybody graduates high school!

402
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,061
-CLAIRE: Shut up!
-Scott!

403
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,695
-* Oh, she's a jolly
good fellow * -Oh.

404
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,696
-Mom, please...
-(singing continues)

405
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,265
Just put on the suit.

406
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,266
Be respectful.

407
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,633
I'll be home in an hour.

408
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,535
Fine!

409
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,770
CLAIRE:
Thank you.

410
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,505
(sighs)

411
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,107
How are you feeling?

412
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,946
I'm sorry.

413
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,049
I tried to warn you,
but you were on the phone.

414
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:19,052
Thanks for letting me
use your phone.

415
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,654
My family has problems, too.

416
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,990
CLAIRE:
I love this house.

417
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,391
SCOTT:
If you have money,

418
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,127
why would you ever
live in Staten Island?

419
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,264
(girls laughing)

420
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,234
(Margie chuckles)

421
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,469
-CLAIRE: Oh, God. Yeah.
-JOANNE: So good.

422
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,871
JOANNE'S MOTHER:
We are so proud

423
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,540
of our daughter Joanne--

424
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,476
and Claire, who's been at
our house so much over the years

425
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,312
you feel like
our second daughter.

426
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,149
Thank you, Margie, for lending
her to us all these years.

427
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:54,554
You guys have worked so hard,
and we are so, so proud of you.

428
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,657
(quietly): Jesus Christ, dial
it back, you fucking fruits.

429
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,658
JOANNE'S FATHER:
Joanne,

430
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,194
you are a very special girl.

431
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,863
You made our dreams
come true, too.

432
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:04,931
You're my sweet angel.

433
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,899
No, she's not.

434
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,668
It's such an honor
to be your parents.

435
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,071
You've taught us as much as
we've taught you. Claire...

436
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,939
JOANNE'S MOTHER:
You've been through so much,

437
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,274
and you've done so well,

438
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,443
so much better than any of us
could have handled it.

439
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,445
Your dad Stan would be
so proud of you.

440
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,080
He's looking down at you
right now.

441
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,281
Yes, he is.

442
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,715
No, he's not.

443
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,851
A toast to Joanne and Claire.

444
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,952
-JOANNE'S FATHER: So proud.
-(scattered cheers)

445
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,288
Congratulations!

446
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,522
-(Lizzo's "Juice" playing)
-GIRLS: * Please don't *

447
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,857
* Make me have to take
your bitch *

448
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,459
* How I roll, if I'm shining *

449
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,861
* Everybody gonna shine... *

450
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,530
-What's up, Todd?
-What's up, Scott?

451
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,299
You going to college,
too, someday?

452
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,134
I'd like to, yeah.
I'd go study law.

453
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:42,635
Oh, yeah?
That's awesome, man.

454
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,637
That sounds really cool.
Do you have any weed?

455
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,273
-I do.
-Could I have some?

456
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,608
-Definitely. I'll go grab it.
-Cool. Thanks, Todd.

457
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,378
Fucking home run, Todd.

458
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,482
It makes me sad
to think of my little sister

459
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,150
sitting in
that sad little house,

460
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,152
-waiting for her son
to be perfect. -(mutters)

461
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,788
(chuckles):
I'm not.

462
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,223
Then you're wasting all of this.

463
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,058
All of it's getting wasted.

464
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,559
-You're a mess.
-You're wasted.

465
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,328
Mom would be so disappoin-- Mom
would be disappointed in you.

466
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,729
You're the one
who's always wasted.

467
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,798
You're wasting. It's like
leaving food on the table.

468
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,400
(both laugh)

469
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,801
Come on.

470
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,836
-Let me take you out.
-It's so hard to meet people.

471
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,438
-I'm totally open.
-No, it's-- I mean, God...

472
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,839
You're not open at all.

473
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,341
-It's really hard to meet
people. -You're a liar.

474
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,775
You're not open.
"Hard to meet people"?

475
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,344
-I'm in the E.R. All I see
is, like... -You meet--

476
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,246
-You meet a hundred people
a night. -People who were shot--

477
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,614
Yeah, they're shot.

478
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,782
They're-they're, uh,
they're criminals.

479
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,151
-Stop limiting yourself.
-Who am I gonna meet?

480
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,152
Stop limiting yourself.

481
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,586
-But I'm at the hospital.
-Yeah.

482
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,887
-They're not all criminals.
-You meet people at work.

483
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,456
-That's what it's...
-Some of them are victims.

484
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,191
Doll...

485
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,927
You know, we could put you on
two shifts a week,

486
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,530
-just-just, just to try it.
-I don't need a job.

487
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,132
I, uh, I got a contact
at a tattoo shop.

488
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,833
I'm-I'm hoping for
an apprenticeship, so...

489
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,535
Then you're gonna need
some money.

490
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,271
Yeah, some of these guys
walk away with 80 bucks in tips.

491
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,673
Scott, your cousin's offering
you a job. Consider it, okay?

492
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,775
If you're good at it,
you can become a waiter.

493
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,710
Why are you offering me
a job anyway?

494
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:01,181
Because I told your father
I'd always look out for you.

495
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,150
How?
He died suddenly in a fire.

496
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,717
Uh, did you ask his ghost?

497
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,287
That's not witty, Scott.

498
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,289
Your dark sense of humor
doesn't work for me.

499
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,523
I find it funny.

500
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,426
It's your sister's big day.
Be a gentleman.

501
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,630
Okay, we lost a few guys
in an ICE raid.

502
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,832
Ah, shit. Sorry.

503
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,701
Maybe you should work
and go to college.

504
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,837
-College is bullshit!
-Oh.

505
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,873
You know who went to Harvard?
The Unabomber.

506
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,876
You know who went to Temple?
Bill Cosby.

507
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,345
You know who else who went
to Temple? Ted Bundy.

508
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,515
You know who went to Hofstra?
Bernie Madoff.

509
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,984
You know who went to Wharton?
Donald Trump.

510
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,286
It's all a scam.

511
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,989
Okay, well, maybe
I shouldn't go, then.

512
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,525
Oh, no, you'll have
the time of your life.

513
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,860
CLAIRE:
Hey, Scott.

514
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,530
Sit down.

515
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,764
Okay.

516
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,166
I got you this.

517
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,779
So, what-what is, uh,
what is, what is this?

518
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,148
It's paintbrushes
and some paint.

519
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,119
Well, I know you're into art,
so I thought you could

520
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,887
expand your horizons
while I'm gone.

521
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,790
You got a gift receipt for this?

522
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,092
-You okay?
-Fine-- Yeah.

523
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,294
Wh-What do you mean?
Yeah, I'm...

524
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,729
You gonna be okay
without me here?

525
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,565
What, you don't think I can
survive here without you?

526
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,367
Okay, just don't be
a dick, okay?

527
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,203
Like, be nice to Mom, okay?
Don't give her a hard time.

528
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,539
-She deserves a break.
-I always give her a-a break.

529
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,774
What are you-- When's--
When am I gonna get my break?

530
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,042
Like...

531
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,444
What are you talking about?

532
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,746
All anyone ever does
is worry about you.

533
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,814
I was ignored my entire
childhood 'cause of you.

534
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,484
Oh, yeah, I forgot that
my childhood was so dandy.

535
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,985
Okay, you don't get
to act crazy your whole life

536
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,119
just 'cause Dad died, okay?

537
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,655
At least you got to know him.

538
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,257
Well, you're lucky you didn't
get to know him, okay?

539
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,624
'Cause that's why
you're almost normal.

540
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,593
If you got to know him,
you would've known that he was,

541
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,562
like, the fucking
coolest guy ever,

542
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,564
and that would've
ruined the rest of your life.

543
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,566
Okay, like,
but what are you gonna do?

544
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,435
Are you gonna get a job or
are you gonna leave the house?

545
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,670
I don't know.

546
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,273
I-I'm gonna open
that tattoo restaurant.

547
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,840
No, like, for real.

548
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,309
I am being real.

549
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,810
It's a great--
It's never been done before.

550
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,345
I looked it up.
I googled it.

551
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,113
It's never been done,
not even as a joke.

552
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,416
Because no one wants
to go to a restaurant

553
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,618
and watch people get tattooed
while they eat.

554
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,653
-It's gross.
-It's the best idea ever.

555
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,122
Ruby Tattoosdays,
where everyone's welcome.

556
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,957
-Chicken and tattoos.
-That's not a business!

557
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,759
You know, you got to get
your shit together.

558
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,160
Time is passing by very quickly.

559
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,096
That's why I smoke weed
all the time, okay?

560
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,197
It slows it all down.

561
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,933
(sighs):
Fucking God.

562
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,802
See, I'm worried about you.

563
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,537
Well, why now?
You never gave a shit.

564
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,539
You, like, literally never
cared until this second.

565
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,873
Like, wh-what, what gives?

566
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,642
You never looked out
for me once.

567
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:43,710
You're my older brother.

568
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,144
You're supposed
to look out for me.

569
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,779
You're-you're just guilty
'cause you're leaving?

570
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,348
Now, all of a sudden,
you're afraid I'm gonna die?

571
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,717
I was gonna die anyway,
whether you stay or not.

572
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,885
-Are you gonna hurt yourself?
-Probably.

573
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,454
Yeah, I'm probably
gonna hurt myself.

574
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,188
I don't know how, but yeah.

575
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,960
If anybody could do it, it's me.

576
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,730
This is why I don't talk to you,
'cause the one thing I know is

577
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,299
you're not gonna listen
to my advice, so...

578
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,534
SCOTT:
Yeah, well, why would I?

579
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,801
Like, you don't even
give a shit.

580
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:09,869
You're-you're leaving.

581
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,237
You're not even
part of the family.

582
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,139
I'm the only fucking
normal person in this family.

583
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,041
Jesus. You know--

584
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,510
Every second I'm away from you,
I'm worrying about you.

585
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,011
That's what you do to people.

586
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,513
You should be worried.

587
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,816
Okay, don't fucking
ruin college for me, okay?

588
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,817
Go!

589
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,519
Fine.

590
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,388
Hey, you should bring that
chipper personality to college.

591
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,156
Guys will love it.

592
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,092
(over TV):
Hello.

593
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,093
(gags)

594
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,397
(groaning)

595
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,167
-Okay, let's see my to-do list.
-(Scott chuckles)

596
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,103
Yo, we're finished
packing the car.

597
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,272
You want to come out
and say goodbye or...?

598
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,408
Oh, well, yeah,
this is almost over.

599
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,710
No, like, we're leaving.

600
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,412
-Oh. She's leaving? -Like,
to go to college, you know?

601
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,046
-Oh, oh, my bad.
-Yeah, four years, so...

602
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,882
-Oh, all right.
-Let's go.

603
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,184
Nope, like-- Go. Come on.

604
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,353
Uh, don't worry about me, okay?

605
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,422
This is really hard right now.
(laughs)

606
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,691
-You don't seem fine.
-(sobs)

607
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm so proud of you.

608
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:10,096
(sobs)

609
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,264
I love you.

610
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,265
Uh, okay.

611
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,934
(laughs)

612
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,604
You're the light of my life.

613
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,238
CLAIRE:
Oh. (sniffling)

614
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,239
Okay. (laughs)

615
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,908
(Claire sighs)

616
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,044
Thanks for helping us
pack the car.

617
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,312
SCOTT:
I'm sorry.

618
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,615
I didn't realize
you guys were done already.

619
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,551
Be nice to Mom.

620
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,086
And please respond to my texts.

621
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,822
I will. Don't worry about it.

622
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:39,392
And, um... I-I'll come
visit you at some point.

623
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,293
(smacks lips)

624
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:42,829
Okay. All right.

625
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,230
-Yeah.
-(sighs)

626
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,998
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

627
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,099
(sniffles)

628
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,869
-MARGIE: Fly.
-(laughs)

629
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,972
(whimpers)

630
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,807
(car door closes)

631
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,142
(engine starts)

632
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,446
(over stereo):
* Keep on hoping we'll eat *

633
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,448
-* Cake by the ocean *
-(Claire whoops)

634
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,583
-* Talk to me, baby... *
-(music fades)

635
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,494
SCOTT (quietly):
Hey.

636
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,663
(chuckles softly)
Hey.

637
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,798
Uh...

638
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,601
I was thinking of finally
seeing that Game of Thrones.

639
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,603
Should I binge it?

640
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,171
Oh, it's a,
it's a pretty violent show.

641
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,006
You sure you could watch that?

642
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,476
I work in an emergency room.

643
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,710
Right, yeah.

644
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,212
So, you could probably handle
a good pillage.

645
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,380
Yeah.

646
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,216
Okay, well, maybe
I'll start watching it.

647
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,851
-Yeah.
-You watch it with me?

648
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:42,989
Um, well, I actually just kind
of finished it, so I-I don't--

649
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,492
It's really fresh in my mind,
so I-I would probably...

650
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,959
-Okay.
-I can watch some of them.

651
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,629
Uh, I don't think I can watch
all of them again, but...

652
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,363
-Well...
-I'll see you later, then.

653
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,365
All right.

654
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,367
Uh, are you okay?

655
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:58,337
Or... (grunts)

656
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,539
Oh. Yeah?

657
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:00,540
-Come on.
-(sniffles)

658
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,241
Uh, it's, it-it's...

659
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,843
It's okay. It's--

660
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,078
I-I'm here. Uh, I'm here.

661
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,314
Don't-don't worry about it.

662
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,448
-She's, you know...
-(sobs)

663
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,584
Well, she's only, like,
45 minutes away,

664
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,621
and she'll-she'll probably
call in, like, five minutes.

665
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,389
-(sniffles)
-But, hey.

666
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,726
You still got me, right?

667
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,729
Yeah.

668
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,034
Oh, shit.

669
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,902
-(laughing)
-Hey, hey!

670
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,940
OSCAR: See, you got to
hold it like this.

671
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,675
TARA:
Let's see. Oh.

672
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,144
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh!

673
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,680
Hey, hey, wait. Hey, hey, guys.

674
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,682
Look, look.

675
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,916
You can't be here, man.

676
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,618
-Y-You got to go.
-KELSEY: Why?

677
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,920
GUARD: It's private property,
that's why.

678
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,256
It's an abandoned orphanage.
Why can't we be here?

679
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:51,558
RICHIE:
Who gives a shit, man?

680
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:52,859
What are you doing here?

681
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,426
You fucking protecting
the ghosts of dead orphans?

682
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:57,429
Look, fat Kanye,
shut your damn mouth.

683
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,966
I'll be back in five minutes
for you assholes.

684
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,234
If you're still here,
I'm calling the cops, period.

685
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,537
You better get the cops, man,
'cause you're a fake cop.

686
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,305
-You need the real ones.
-GUARD: Motherfuckers.

687
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,407
-Fuck all of y'all.
-IGOR: I feel bad.

688
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,876
We-we were a little too mean.

689
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,477
-SCOTT: Yeah.
-He's nice.

690
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:12,912
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

691
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:17,449
See, that guy-- that is what is
wrong with Staten Island.

692
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:20,486
We don't get any cool people
from any of the other boroughs.

693
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,854
No one comes here.

694
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,090
We're stuck with the
fucking pricks that live here.

695
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,758
You're talking about us.

696
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:27,126
Right in front of us.

697
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,127
KELSEY:
Yeah, kinda.

698
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,796
I mean, no one comes here.

699
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,598
There's no flow of people.
That guy's, like, 200.

700
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,999
We've known him
since we were six.

701
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,901
Why can't we be cool
like Brooklyn?

702
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,836
There's no reason we shouldn't
be cool like Brooklyn.

703
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,338
We got amazing views.
It's close to the city.

704
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,641
It's cheap. Nice people.
It makes no sense.

705
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,110
We're, like, the only place
that New Jersey looks down on.

706
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,979
-You could see the garbage dump
from space. -(Tara laughs)

707
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,748
This place is
never gonna change.

708
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,982
No, it happened to
the Meatpacking District,

709
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,183
the Village.

710
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,119
Brooklyn used to be
a fucking shithole.

711
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,253
We are next.

712
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,554
I'm gonna take
my civil service test.

713
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,757
I'm gonna work in the city,
in city planning.

714
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,926
You watch, this place is gonna
be like fucking Williamsburg

715
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,428
-in ten years. -RICHIE: No, all
right? No. Nobody wants that.

716
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,697
Why do you want to work in
the city and do city planning?

717
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:05,698
That sounds so boring.

718
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,199
I feel like Brooklyn is better.

719
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,801
I dated a guy
that lived in Brooklyn.

720
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:09,936
He was a mixologist.

721
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,538
He made ice cubes out of milk.

722
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,707
-He was so classy.
-OSCAR: Shut up!

723
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,643
I love Staten Island.

724
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:17,877
It's amazing.

725
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,712
And people are gonna
see it soon, trust me.

726
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,313
SCOTT:
Well, if you love it so much,

727
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,849
why don't you let me
tattoo it on you?

728
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,851
No, I'm not gonna let you
tattoo me again.

729
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:25,852
Fine.

730
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,988
Well, I need somebody to tattoo.

731
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,556
I'm, I-I'm running out of...

732
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,891
Come on, Rich.
What about you, man?

733
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,026
-Don't even look at me, dude.
-Why?

734
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,895
Your work is mad inconsistent.

735
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,329
Obama ain't right.

736
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,698
SCOTT:
I got the eyes wrong, okay?

737
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,966
RICHIE:
He's not right.

738
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,068
All right, man,
this has hurt me, all right?

739
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,670
I don't have
any black friends anymore.

740
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,638
I can't go to
a barber shop no more.

741
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,474
You got Obama wrong.
Ain't nothing worse than that.

742
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,743
What about you, Igor?
You want a dragon or something?

743
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,244
Oh, I love your tattoos.

744
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,479
My brother?

745
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,914
It's a spitting image.

746
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,315
-SCOTT: Yeah. It's one of
the best. -It's my favorite.

747
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,717
No, no, no, no.
This is my favorite.

748
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,085
Oh, you killed that.

749
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,419
-Yeah, I really worked hard
on the eyes. -Just...

750
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,655
He's so cute.
I love his butthole.

751
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,523
It reminds me that I have
a belly button.

752
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,492
-So, I'm good.
-Yeah, I got to go.

753
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,528
(chuckles): Watching you beg
to give tattoos is too sad.

754
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:11,931
(laughs):
And that's freaking me out.

755
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,565
-(tattoo gun buzzing)
-SCOTT: We're almost done.

756
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,834
-(Igor groans)
-Almost.

757
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,769
(panting sharply)

758
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,504
(seabirds squawking in distance)

759
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,872
All right.

760
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,540
-You're all done.
-That looks really good.

761
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,175
Yeah, I mean, I wish

762
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,011
you'd let me do
something cooler, but yeah.

763
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,779
Oh, fuck no.
That hurts so bad.

764
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:29,181
-Another dumb tattoo. -SCOTT:
Yeah, but I-I like the pain.

765
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,517
The-the pain is the whole point
of getting tattoos.

766
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,052
Don't you just love
when you're getting tattooed,

767
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,854
and it hits the bone
and pinches a nerve,

768
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,022
and you're like...
(pained groan)

769
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,857
I'm not a fan of the pain.

770
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,358
You shouldn't let him
do it to you, all right?

771
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,559
He's inconsistent.

772
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,561
OSCAR:
I think that tattoo's dumb.

773
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,463
Y'all should've told me
when you saw the design.

774
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,664
It says, "Unfollow me."

775
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,199
You don't even have
that many followers.

776
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,435
Carla follows me.

777
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,037
-Bro, she's imaginary.
-OSCAR: Carla not real.

778
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,371
Carla's not real, dude.

779
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,406
RICHIE: How many times
do we have to say this?

780
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,242
-SCOTT: She's not real.
-(insect buzzing)

781
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,710
I hate bugs, dawg.

782
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:58,878
I'm a gangster!

783
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,246
SCOTT:
No, that's a bee, bro!

784
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,448
OSCAR:
There's a kid down there.

785
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,983
-Yo, kid!
-(chuckles): Oh, yo.

786
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,952
-Yo, kid, what's up?
-Oh, shit, there is a kid.

787
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,619
What are you doing?

788
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,388
You hanging out on the beach?
Come here, come here.

789
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,623
Don't-don't be shy.
No stranger danger here.

790
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:12,892
I'm not gonna touch you.

791
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,260
-What's up, pal?
-What are you doing?

792
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,494
I'm looking for my friend.

793
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,896
(mocking):
"Looking for my friend."

794
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,465
-(Richie laughs)
-You want to be friends with us?

795
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,734
We're the good guys, right?

796
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:22,935
-You can hang out with us, pal.
-Come on.

797
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,937
Let me get some of that.
Put it right there.

798
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,272
-(fists bump)
-(imitates explosion)

799
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,640
-Ho! (laughs)
-You gang.

800
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:29,976
Part of the gang.

801
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,443
SCOTT:
Gang.

802
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,611
What's that?

803
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:33,846
Uh, it's a tattoo gun.

804
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,281
I was giving the homeys tattoos.

805
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,483
-I want a tattoo.
-(laughter)

806
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,518
-You're a tough guy?
-SCOTT: Really?

807
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,821
-Sure, young guy.
You want a tattoo? -Yeah.

808
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,123
Dude, kid wants a tattoo.
That's my guy right there.

809
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,324
Bro, you-you can't
give him a tattoo.

810
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,759
-He's a little kid.
-Yeah, there we go.

811
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,660
-You want a tattoo? -Bro,
I got to practice on something.

812
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,096
-Yeah.
-He seems old enough.

813
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,798
-OSCAR: You a tough guy?
-Yeah.

814
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:52,999
-You a badass.
-(laughter)

815
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,466
Come on,
show those muscles, kid.

816
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,168
-Come on. Both arms, both arms.
-RICHIE: Yeah, there you go.

817
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,170
-Put 'em up. -SCOTT: You got
tickets to the gun show?

818
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,939
-There it is. There it is.
-All right. -There we go.

819
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,440
-What's your name?
-Harold.

820
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,708
I'm-a call you Harry.

821
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,276
Don't. It's Harold.

822
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,045
-Oh.
-RICHIE (chuckles): Okay.

823
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,980
-Hell yeah.
-I like this kid.

824
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,715
I need him in my life.

825
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,117
He has structure.

826
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,318
(lighter clicks)

827
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,053
Guys, I don't think
that's a good idea.

828
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,889
I mean... we don't listen
to anything you say.

829
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,325
-Yeah. -Yeah, I mean, why do
you even try to give us advice?

830
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,460
SCOTT: So, what do you want
a tattoo of?

831
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,461
The Punisher.

832
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,163
-The Punisher?
-RICHIE: Okay.

833
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,798
-That's tough, man.
-SCOTT: All right.

834
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:28,300
He could've said anything.
He said The Punisher.

835
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,336
Oh, yeah, I could do that.
Is that it?

836
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,570
Yeah, that's him.

837
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,806
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

838
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,742
Do I have your legal permission
to do this?

839
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,477
-Yes.
-That's good enough for me.

840
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,079
-How about you guys?
-OSCAR: Holds up in court.

841
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,247
You guys heard it. All right.

842
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,849
Yo, he can't get consent.
He's ten.

843
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:46,185
Now, hold still, okay?
'Cause it is permanent.

844
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,021
Yo, guys. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

845
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,722
-Put your game face on.
-SCOTT: Don't worry, dude.

846
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,325
This will just be on you
for the rest of your life.

847
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,261
-(tattoo gun buzzing)
-There you go.

848
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,929
-Look at you, tough guy.
-RICHIE: There you go.

849
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,098
-(screams) I don't want
to do it! -Uh...

850
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,566
-I don't wanna!
-Well, I got to finish it.

851
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,101
-Now there's just a line.
-OSCAR: Calm down, man.

852
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,903
-You're gonna look stupid. Sit
back down. Relax. -Calm down.

853
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,437
-Sit down. Do it.
-Relax.

854
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,906
-RICHIE: Whoa! Hey!
-Hey! -Hey!

855
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,740
-Hey, run! Run, kid!
-Hey!

856
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,776
Run, little man! Run!

857
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,611
Run!

858
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,246
Goddamn it.

859
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,948
I fucking believed
in that kid, man.

860
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:19,551
He seemed so tough at first,
uh, but then immediately wasn't.

861
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,420
That's why I don't fuck
with millennials, dude.

862
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,723
Again, we are the millennials.

863
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,725
He keeps saying that, but
I don't know what that means.

864
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,761
I regret my friendship
with you guys.

865
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,598
(heavy knocking)

866
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,209
Yeah, hello.
My name's Raymond Bishop.

867
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,411
This is my son, Harold.
Say hello, Harold.

868
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,745
I'm sorry.

869
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:48,915
What's going on?

870
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,582
Well, it seems your son
was down in the woods

871
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,885
giving out free tattoos, and
my son was one of his victims.

872
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,887
What?
Well, I-I don't understand.

873
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,489
How do you know it was my son?
How'd you get this address?

874
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:59,825
I have my ways.
Believe me, I have my ways.

875
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,027
Are you a cop?

876
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,728
No, I'm a fireman, okay?
I work for a living.

877
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,996
Look at this.
Do you believe this?

878
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,797
You see that there?
See that line?

879
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,666
I don't know if you
burn these off or what,

880
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,935
but we're taking care of this

881
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,302
and you're paying for it,
you understand me?

882
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,638
-I don't know what this is.
-Scott! Oh.

883
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,306
I am-- I'm so sorry.

884
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,908
I-I-I...

885
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,977
There's an aesthetic laser
at the hospital where I work,

886
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,946
and it can completely remove it.

887
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,313
Uh, I get a discount.

888
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:22,781
I'm-I'm gonna pay
for the whole thing.

889
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,616
I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm-- I feel terrible.

890
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,617
You should feel terrible!

891
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,953
Look at that!

892
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,955
-What's up? Oh, fuck.
-Ah, there he is.

893
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,323
-You get your ass out here!
-Hey, he said he was 18.

894
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,926
He looks like he's four,
you fucking moron! Sorry.

895
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,928
-He consented!
-He's lying.

896
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,696
-Harold, come on!
-RAY: Course he's lying!

897
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,999
You can't have consent!
He's nine years old!

898
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,633
Dad, let's go.
You're embarrassing me.

899
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:42,701
We're not going anywhere, okay?

900
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,802
He's just a little kid!

901
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,004
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

902
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,605
Uh, he was roaming around
in the woods.

903
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,174
He wanted a tattoo.
W-Where were you?

904
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,942
I was at fucking work!

905
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,177
-Fuck you! -Hey!
-Come out here!

906
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,511
If I was you,
I'd shut your fucking mouth,

907
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,712
because I can
call the cops right now

908
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:54,913
and have your ass
thrown in jail.

909
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,715
-For what? -For sticking
needles in a kid's arm,

910
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:57,950
you fucking dope!

911
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,952
Did you even raise him?
Did you even raise him?

912
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,021
You know, there's no reason
to call the cops.

913
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,057
I can handle this and I can
also handle disciplining him.

914
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:07,193
Well, clearly you can't or you
wouldn't have a middle-aged son

915
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:10,396
still living at home, tattooing
minors against their will!

916
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,164
I asked him to do it.

917
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,966
-It's not his fault.
-That's right. That's my man.

918
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,235
Go wait in the car.
Harold, go on.

919
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,469
-(sighs) -And don't raise
your voice at me, either.

920
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,837
Later, Harold.

921
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,806
Don't say goodbye to my kid.
Look both ways.

922
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,574
-Look both ways!
-Go to your room.

923
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,010
-I am!
-Watch your mouth.

924
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,412
For your information,
I am not a middle-aged man.

925
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,081
I'm a 24-year-old man,
and I'm going to my room

926
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:30,849
'cause I fucking want to.

927
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:34,220
What kind of fucking animal are
you raising in this house, huh?

928
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,587
I'm bringing you the bill.

929
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,056
I don't care what it costs,
all right?

930
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,391
-I mean, what the fuck is going
on around here? -All right.

931
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,027
Just give me a day
to arrange the laser.

932
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,661
All right.
You know, you know something?

933
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,030
I-Is his father home?
Where's his dad?

934
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,664
I-I don't, I don't want
to fucking yell at you.

935
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,733
He's deceased.

936
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,669
Oh.

937
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,204
Well, uh...
(clears throat)

938
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,905
I'm, uh, sorry for your loss.

939
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,274
I'm sure if he was still around,

940
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,675
he would agree with
the fact that,

941
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,211
you know, you should
still pay for it.

942
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,150
(woman humming a tune)

943
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,020
Comically huge mustache.

944
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,022
Is this what he looked like?

945
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,223
That's exactly
what he looked like.

946
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,292
-You're scared of me. (laughs)
-Yeah.

947
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,693
Yo, he-he--
And that's not funny.

948
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,428
He burst into the door,
started screaming,

949
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,430
and his mustache was
flapping all over the place.

950
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,432
-(laughs): Flapping.
-He looked the Monopoly Man.

951
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,601
It was terrifying.

952
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,536
-(mocking): "Look both ways!
-(laughing)

953
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,438
Look both ways!"

954
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,240
-Fucking maniac.
-But I will say,

955
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:31,643
probably not a good idea to
tattoo children in the woods.

956
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,479
-Yeah, probably. -You know,
you could get in trouble.

957
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,147
-Yeah, you could.
-Why did you do that?

958
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,282
-I don't know.
-(chuckles)

959
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,616
I thought I would
get away with it.

960
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,218
Plus, I thought he was, like,
at least 15, you know?

961
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,752
-Oh, really? -I got--
Yeah, I got my first tattoo...

962
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,222
-How old was he?
-Nine.

963
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,723
(chuckles):
You thought he was 15?

964
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,592
-Yeah, I'm fucking... -Maybe
you've been smoking too much.

965
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:47,926
I think I'm just stupid.

966
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,296
-(laughing)
-Uh...

967
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:51,630
No, you should see
my mom, though.

968
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,632
-It's so weird
since my sister left. -Yeah.

969
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,334
She's just crying
all the time and, like,

970
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,303
-she's trying to talk to me
and hang out with me. -Mm.

971
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,071
The other day, she asked me
to go to Nordstrom Rack.

972
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,939
-I almost slit my throat.
-(laughs)

973
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:01,973
Did you go?

974
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,609
No. I pretended to be asleep.

975
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,444
Oh, come on, she--
Maybe she needs company.

976
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,313
She's lonely
without your sister.

977
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,082
Yeah, she's-she's,
she's gonna be lonely.

978
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,351
I mean, you should've seen her
at my sister's send-off party.

979
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,486
It was, it was really weird.

980
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,124
There was a party?
(laughs)

981
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,191
Yeah.

982
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:20,759
Why wasn't I invited?

983
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,994
To a high school
graduation party?

984
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,030
Well, who was there?

985
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,032
(sighs):
It was, you know, it was just

986
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,935
family and... shit.

987
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,870
What, you don't want me
to be around your family?

988
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,472
I've known them since I was ten.

989
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,873
Well, yeah, I just--

990
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,675
I didn't think it was something
you would want to go to.

991
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,843
I'm-I'm sorry.

992
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,845
Come on, that's fucked up.

993
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,780
Why? Why is that fucked up?

994
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,717
Because we're, you know,
doing something here.

995
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,153
We're-- Are-are we
doing something here?

996
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,487
I don't know,
we're starting a thing.

997
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,222
I mean, we're having sex
and we're hanging out a lot.

998
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,224
-I mean, it's...
-I thought it was just, like,

999
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,294
more, you know,
casual than that.

1000
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,628
You know?

1001
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:03,369
Well, you don't want me to go
to any, like, life events?

1002
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:06,238
Life-- What's a life event?

1003
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:08,374
What does that,
what does that even mean?

1004
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,677
You know what? It's fine.

1005
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,811
-What?
-No, it's fine.

1006
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,979
Come back.

1007
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,714
I'm sor-- Wait.

1008
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,716
-(Kelsey groans)
-Wai...

1009
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,318
-You know what? You're right.
-What?

1010
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,019
What are you talking about?
I'm never right.

1011
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,888
No, you're right.
We shouldn't do this anymore.

1012
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,756
I don't want
to fucking do this anymore.

1013
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,358
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

1014
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,194
It was all a mistake.
It was a mistake.

1015
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,695
But it's fine.
We're on the same page.

1016
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,230
We'll go back
to what it was before.

1017
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,232
I'll treat you like I do
Oscar and Richie.

1018
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,500
I-It's not even that.

1019
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,001
It's just, like,
I-I don't know what I want yet.

1020
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,336
Like, I'm trying
to figure my shit out.

1021
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,238
And you should. Please do.
Figure your shit out.

1022
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,072
But we're not gonna
have sex anymore, okay?

1023
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,641
I got to go.

1024
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,745
I should've invited you
to the party!

1025
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,680
I didn't know
it was a life event!

1026
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,217
Oh. Oh.

1027
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,552
I-I already arranged to, uh,
pay directly at the hospital.

1028
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,721
But if you want a check,
just give me two minutes, okay?

1029
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,723
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm-- I-I want to pay.

1030
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,691
I'm gonna pay for it.
I'm gonna pay for it.

1031
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,926
No, no, no.
I'm gonna pay for it.

1032
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,461
And I'm, and I'm also
gonna talk to Scott

1033
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,863
because that was totally
out of line, totally nuts.

1034
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,565
Yeah, I-I understand that.

1035
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,801
But, uh, look, I just wanted
to apologize, okay?

1036
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,438
I-I got a little
out of control before, uh...

1037
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:15,741
You know, I just, I let
my anger get the best of me.

1038
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,076
Broke my stupid resolution.
(sighs)

1039
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,911
God knows it's what
messed up my marriage,

1040
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,947
and I-I just really wanted
to apologize, okay?

1041
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,449
I mean, I was upset,

1042
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,717
but I-I shouldn't have
conveyed it that way.

1043
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,918
There's no need to apologize.

1044
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,654
My kid's being a fucking
lunatic. It's not cool.

1045
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,323
Oh, I... I overreacted.
He's fine.

1046
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:33,292
No, it's the tip of the iceberg.

1047
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,295
Ah, you know, lot of kids
do stuff like this.

1048
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,929
Mm, kids don't do
stuff like this.

1049
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,231
He did the second-worst thing

1050
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,899
you could do
to a kid in the woods.

1051
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,001
(laughs)

1052
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:46,838
Well, either way, I shouldn't
have behaved the way I behaved.

1053
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,607
So, I'm truly sorry.

1054
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,277
Apology accepted.
It's nice.

1055
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,144
Don't get many of those
around here.

1056
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:54,980
-Thanks.
-Oh, hey, this might seem

1057
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,982
a little crazy, but, uh...

1058
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,518
can I take you out
for a cup of coffee?

1059
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:03,021
MARGIE:
So, Scott did this.

1060
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,257
RAY:
Oh. Is that a cocker spaniel?

1061
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,926
No. No, that's my daughter.

1062
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,027
-That's Claire.
-Oh.

1063
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,296
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can...

1064
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,497
-Yeah, I just thought...
-No, it's okay.

1065
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,864
-I thought those were ears.
-Um, it's okay.

1066
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,266
-That's her hair. Okay, yep.
-I know. I hear that.

1067
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,503
Scott got his first tattoo
when he was 16.

1068
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,371
-Oh, okay.
-It was of Kermit the Frog.

1069
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:21,307
Oh. (laughs)

1070
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,842
-That's kind of cute.
-Yeah, yeah.

1071
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,445
Kermit smoking a joint, so...

1072
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,280
Kermit smoking a joint?

1073
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,548
Geez, I don't remember
that episode

1074
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:30,716
on Sesame Street, huh?

1075
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,150
(laughs)

1076
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,852
That's kind of funny.
He's a funny kid, then, huh?

1077
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,387
-Oh, he's so funny.
-Yeah?

1078
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,155
-He's so funny. -You think
he's gonna stick it out?

1079
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,157
Uh, well, that I don't know.

1080
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,026
I mean, I sent him
to art school, but he quit.

1081
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,129
-He-he couldn't really focus
'cause... -Oh.

1082
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,733
He also has ADD, so he...

1083
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,636
Anyway, he's a tattoo artist
with ADD.

1084
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,903
(chuckles)
Well, you know what?

1085
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,372
All the guys
down at the firehouse,

1086
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,073
they all have tattoos
and stuff, you know.

1087
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,175
Personally, I never got one,
though, you know.

1088
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,910
You know, not that I have
anything against them.

1089
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:01,279
I just, I just always felt
I was too pasty.

1090
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,317
-So, the firehouse, huh?
-Yeah.

1091
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,718
The old firehouse.

1092
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,254
-Mm-hmm, the old firehouse.
-Yeah.

1093
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,056
So, you're a ladder or engine?

1094
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,058
Ladder.

1095
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,826
Knew it.

1096
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,062
You got firefighters
in your family?

1097
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,897
Yeah, my husband.

1098
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,499
-Oh, geez. Sorry.
-Yeah.

1099
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,833
Forgot.

1100
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,772
Hey, uh, I hope this isn't
too forward, but do you mind

1101
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,208
if-if I ask what happened
to your husband?

1102
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,110
Oh, it was a hotel fire.

1103
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,779
The roof collapsed.

1104
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,581
He went in to save somebody.

1105
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,685
They told him it wasn't safe,
but, you know, he was like that.

1106
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,288
-Wait, Stan Carlin
was your husband? -Mm-hmm.

1107
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,556
-Paramount Hotel fire?
-Yeah, yeah.

1108
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,857
Did you know him?

1109
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,426
-You, you-- Or you heard...
-No, no, no, I...

1110
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,894
Hung out with him or...?

1111
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,362
No, I j--
I just heard about him.

1112
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,697
-Oh.
-He was a real brave guy.

1113
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,098
-Yeah.
-He was kind of a,

1114
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,900
kind of a legend,
to be honest with you.

1115
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,636
-(chuckles)
-Yeah. Yeah.

1116
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,372
And Scott was only seven
when it happened, so...

1117
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,708
-Oh, that's tough.
-A lot of consequences.

1118
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,043
-Yeah, that's a tough
situation, but... -Yeah.

1119
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,979
But I-I got to tell you,
you did a great job, you know?

1120
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:09,314
-See, I mean, I...
-(chuckles)

1121
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,082
I know we had a little bit
of a difference there,

1122
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,651
-but, I mean, he's a good kid.
-Uh-huh.

1123
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,653
And I got to tell you, if-if
the worst he's doing is-is,

1124
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,555
you know, a couple
unlawful tattoos,

1125
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,557
-you-you did a hell of a job.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

1126
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,159
Yeah, I don't think that's
the worst he's doing, though.

1127
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,928
-Oh.
-(both laugh)

1128
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,430
-Yeah.
-Well, I don't know.

1129
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,632
You know, uh, that's
how kids are, you know?

1130
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,168
Everybody gets it
at a different time.

1131
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,803
Anyways, what are you, uh--

1132
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,439
I-I'm just sitting here,
doing all the talking here.

1133
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,441
What do you, what do you do?

1134
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,908
I'm a nurse.

1135
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,410
I'm a school nurse.
(clears throat)

1136
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,679
I'm also an ER nurse.

1137
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,914
-You work in the ER?
-Mm-hmm.

1138
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,084
Jesus Christ, Margie,
we probably met each other.

1139
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,118
Could be.

1140
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,520
So, how you doing?

1141
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:50,255
I'm...

1142
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,290
very tired.

1143
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,792
Really?
Well, you don't look tired.

1144
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:54,993
(Margie laughs)

1145
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,428
No, seriously, you look great.

1146
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,664
-Really?
-Yeah.

1147
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:01,967
I just don't, like-- I mean,
are you flirting with me or...?

1148
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,335
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1149
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,804
Yeah, a lot. This is,
this is what it looks like.

1150
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,806
It is really subtle.
I couldn't--

1151
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,140
(laughing):
I can't tell what's going on.

1152
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,509
This is how it looks.
I'm very subtle.

1153
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:11,577
All right.

1154
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,144
-I'm rusty. You're subtle.
-Okay.

1155
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,279
-Yeah, yeah.
-Nice to meet you.

1156
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,515
(both laugh)

1157
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,617
JOE: I see you out there, man.
You're doing great.

1158
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,118
Keep-- Just keep doing
what you're doing.

1159
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,520
Have a good time, you know?

1160
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,022
The more fun you have,
the more fun the customers have.

1161
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,557
All right, thanks.

1162
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,726
("Can't Understand"
by Johnny Amoroso playing)

1163
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,995
Hey, busboy,
why is table 12 still dirty?

1164
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,497
Oh, 'cause they were talking.

1165
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,565
I didn't think I should
interrupt them, but...

1166
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,200
Interrupt them.
Get them out of here.

1167
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,468
-All right.
-Do your job.

1168
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:38,737
-Sorry. Whoa.
-Take it easy there, brother.

1169
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,072
-My bad. -Jesus.
-Thank you.

1170
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,209
Uh, hi. Uh, are you done
enjoying your meal?

1171
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,211
There is food in my mouth,
and I am chewing.

1172
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:47,879
Do you think that I'm finished?

1173
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,515
I'm just holding this
for my health?

1174
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:50,982
-Get me some water.
-Sorry.

1175
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,051
-Hey, come here. Come here.
Can we order? -Uh, yeah.

1176
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,586
-I'll go get your waiter.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

1177
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,987
We don't have time for that.
We're in a hurry.

1178
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,022
WOMAN:
I'm starving.

1179
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,423
MAN:
Okay. Can I go?

1180
00:40:58,557 --> 00:40:59,858
WOMAN: Usually, the woman
goes first, but go ahead.

1181
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:00,959
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, yeah?

1182
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,193
-How about I'm paying?
-All right.

1183
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,196
Can I have a chicken parm
with meat sauce?

1184
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,698
No marinara.

1185
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,267
Thin. Thin chicken parm.

1186
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,702
Why aren't you writing it down?

1187
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,605
Yeah, I-I can't actually
because, uh, I'm not a waiter.

1188
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,174
I'm just a busboy, so
they don't even give me a pen.

1189
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,176
Memorize it. Yeah.

1190
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,778
Seafood pasta.
That's what I want.

1191
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,780
No clams, okay?
Double up on the shrimp.

1192
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,215
That's how I always get it.
We come here all the time.

1193
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,552
I'm not gonna remember
a word you guys just said.

1194
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,019
It's not rocket science.
Just go.

1195
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,454
-Get our shit.
-Oh, I'm-- All right.

1196

I'm starving.

* Send me the addy,
I'm hunting 'em down *

1198

* Send me the addy, I'm
hunting 'em down *

1199
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,561
* Grrt, grrt... *

1200
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,462
There a dance party
or something?

1201
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,364
-It's fight night.
-JOE: All right, fight night!

1202
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,866
Tournament of champions!

1203
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,367
Fighting for tips.

1204
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,602
Who's going?
Who's going first?

1205
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,804
-I, Zoots.
-Zoots.

1206
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,139
-Everyone fights for their tips.
-The tips that we earn?

1207
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:51,643
Y-Yeah, but you have
to fight for them now.

1208
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:53,444
Who wants some?! Huh?!

1209
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,246
-Huh? -Who got it?!
-It's you, bro.

1210
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,082
-No way. No, no way.
-Put the gloves on.

1211
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,884
Get in there. Get in there.
Hit him.

1212
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,719
-Hey, yo.
-SCOTT: Hey.

1213
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,721
I don't want-- Please, I don--
I-I don't want to do this.

1214
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,422
-Let's just not do this.
-You don't want to do this?

1215
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,924
-What do you mean? -No, well,
'cause we're friends, right?

1216
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,726
Yeah, no, for the next
15 seconds,

1217
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,160
this friendship is over, son.

1218
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,395
-Understand that?
-What?

1219
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,563
-Hmm?
-What?

1220
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,064
Got to understand,
fighting is serious.

1221
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,499
-I don't like it.
-It's sacred.

1222
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:16,167
It's how I tribute
my Lord and Savior.

1223
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:17,603
-What?
-It's the way I tribute

1224
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:18,704
my Lord and Savior, Jesus.

1225
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:19,905
I don't think
Jesus would want you

1226
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,039
to kick my ass right now.

1227
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,273
He would want me
to have these tips.

1228
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:23,308
-That's what he means.
-You can have the tips.

1229
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,309
I don't even want 'em.

1230
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,443
-What is this?
-I don't know.

1231
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:26,678
What's this shit?

1232
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:28,046
I've seen Creed a f--
a couple times.

1233
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,748
-What'd you do?
-I seen Creed a couple times.

1234
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,583
-Oh. -Are we about to do
the Cotton Eye Joe?

1235
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:32,651
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1236
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,185
-Come on, son.
-Okay.

1237
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,386
-Yeah. Okay. -Come on, son.
Oh, that's right.

1238
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,655
You gonna come this way?
Come this way, boy.

1239
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,023
-Okay. -Come on.
Go ahead, take your shot, boy.

1240
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,324
-Go ahead, take your shot, boy.
-MAN: For real?

1241
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,492
-Uh-huh, yeah. Come on!
-MAN: Ooh!

1242
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:44,029
ZOOTS:
Now we are friends,

1243
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,864
-goddamn it!
-(groans): Oh, geez.

1244
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:49,000
-Take that shit. Yeah!
-(groaning)

1245
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,871
We friends now, nigga, 'cause
that's what friends are for.

1246
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,106
Out this bitch.

1247
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,942

1248
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,644
* Zoots done did it again, uh *

1249
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,545
* Said Zoots done
did it again, ah... *

1250
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,748
I think we have a winner.

1251
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,383
-(quietly): Come here.
-Mm-hmm.

1252
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,584
Mm.

1253
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,187
Mm. Let me just...

1254
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,889
-Just want to get
this sweater off. -Okay.

1255
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,858
And I want to turn off
this light.

1256
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:14,793
Let me turn it off.

1257
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,494
-Okay.
-Okay.

1258
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:17,829
(both grunt)

1259
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:20,899
Just one-one second.

1260
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,368
Let me, let me, let me
turn off this light.

1261
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,137
Got a lot of lamps, huh?

1262
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,739
It's like a store or something.

1263
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:28,907
-(chuckles)
-Come here.

1264
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,077
-(Margie laughing)
-Mm.

00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,628
Come sit down.

1289
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,197
I need to talk to you
about something.

1290
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,632
What's up?

1291
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,967
Someone die?

1292
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,969
No, no, nobody's dead.

1293
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,038
Thank God.

1294
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,474
I'm seeing somebody.

1295
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,943
What does that mean?

1296
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,311
Uh, uh, I'm seeing a man.

1297
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:43,548
Well, I-I've been dating
someone for a little while now.

1298
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,116
You're dating someone?

1299
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,885
That-That's awesome.

1300
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,821
Like, w-why are you dating him
secretly, you little slut?

1301
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:51,222
W-Why didn't you tell me?

1302
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,624
Is he, like,
really, really old or...

1303
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,993
or is he really, really young?

1304
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,427
Is it one of my friends?
Is it Igor?

1305
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:59,230
No, no, no. I just, I...
(laughs)

1306
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,934
I just didn't want to bother you
unless it was really serious.

1307
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,469
Bother? You're my mom.

1308
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:05,837
I hope you're getting
banged out real good.

1309
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:06,838
Who's the lucky guy?

1310
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:09,140
Uh, it's, um...

1311
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,010
It's Ray.

1312
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:14,079
Who's Ray?

1313
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,081
Remember the kid you tattooed?

1314
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,648
His father.

1315
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:20,118
-That fucking prick?
-Yeah, I know.

1316
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:23,021
He's a really nice man,
and he's really good to me.

1317
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,957
-And he's a fireman.
-He's a fireman?!

1318
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,025
That's fucked up.

1319
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:28,659
-Why?
-W-What do you mean, why?

1320
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:31,797
I mean, uh, you haven't dated
anyone in 17 years since Dad,

1321
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,364
and the first guy you date
is a fireman?

1322
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:34,800
You don't think
that's a little fucking weird?

1323
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,002
I got nothing against firemen.

1324
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:38,770
Neither do I, but
the-the guy doesn't like me,

1325
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,506
and he has the same job as Dad,
like... (stammers)

1326
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,275
I'm fucked up as it is, Mom.
Like, I have Crohn's, okay?

1327
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,044
There's something wrong
up here. Huh.

1328
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,813
I can't find my watch!

1329
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,214
What are you trying
to do to me here?!

1330
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:50,381
Haven't I been through enough?!

1331
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:51,716
Wait, what did I,
what did I do wrong?

1332
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,051
W-What did I do wrong?
What did I do?

1333
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,053
What-- I'm sorry.
Like, what did I do?

1334
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:56,855
(stammers) I'm not,
I'm not doing it to you.

1335
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,990
I just-- I-I don't want to be
alone the rest of my life.

1336
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,558
I don't want you
to be alone, either.

1337
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,493
That would suck, but, like,
come on. This is, like--

1338
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:04,830
This is pretty obvious this is
not a good choice, right?

1339
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:06,664
(sighs)

1340
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:09,000
I would like us to have dinner.

1341
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,169
I-- This is
very, very important to me.

1342
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,603
I am in a serious
relationship...

1343
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,672
-You're in a serious rela...
-...with a very nice man.

1344
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,474
With that guy?! Come on!

1345
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,076
Y-You don't love him, do you?

1346
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,845
You're not say-- You're not,
like, saying that, right?

1347
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:21,880
I-I-- Well, we don't use
that word yet.

1348
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:24,515
But if he said it to me,
I-I would say it back.

1349
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:27,218
Oh, my God! Jesus!

1350
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,087
Do you not learn?!

1351
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,489
Look what happened last time!

1352
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,924
-You want to do that again?
-Okay. All right?

1353
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:34,025
How about this?

1354
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,861
How about we come by
the restaurant

1355
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:37,428
and we have dinner
when you're working

1356
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:39,097
and you just come by
and you just say hi?

1357
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,266
Just say hi a couple times.
How about that?

1358
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,600
How about that?

1359
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,070
How about--
Why don't you ask him?

1360
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:46,171
Huh?

1361
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,705
Why don't you just build

1362
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,407
another shrine to Ray
while you're at it?

1363
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,743
Right across from Dad's
so they can be fucking pals!

1364
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,580
Yeah, I like that better.

1365
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:56,848
But I'm actually
finding you funny

1366
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,116
'cause you're really funny.

1367
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,250
-(Margie laughs)
-(jazz music playing)

1368
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:00,718
Look at this guy.

1369
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,354
-Having the time of his life.
-ZOOTS: Mm-hmm.

1370
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,890
Acting like he owns the place.

1371
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,959
I know that guy.
Eggplant parmesan.

1372
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:09,727
(chuckles):
Oh. I'll be.

1373
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:12,030
Your moms is a bit of a baddie.

1374
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,531
She look postcoital.

1375
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,433
-What's "postcoital"?
-It's like post-fucking,

1376
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,268
but it's your mom,
so I want to be nice.

1377
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:19,737
But, uh, (chuckles)
oh, it's definitely happening.

1378
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,773
(exhales slowly)

1379
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,411
Postcoital.

1380
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:27,812
-(laughing)
-If you ever come to see me,

1381
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,280
if you ever come
see me, that's--

1382
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,715
-It'll happen that night,
I guarantee it. -Yeah, I know.

1383
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,150
Oh, here he is.

1384
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:33,418
-Hey.
-Hey.

1385
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,585
-How you doing?
-Good. How are you?

1386
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:35,987
Good to see you again. Yeah.

1387
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:38,256
Uh, I'm-I'm really sorry
for branding your kid.

1388
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,658
Oh, no, no, no.
It's-it's fine. It's fine.

1389
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,793
Cost 350, but I didn't make
your mom pay for it.

1390
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:44,295
(Ray laughs)

1391
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:46,431
But, uh, hey, no harm, no foul.

1392
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,767
You know? 'Cause, uh,
if that didn't happen, I, uh...

1393
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,436
wouldn't have met
this lovely lady.

1394
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,271
Oh, well, happy to help.

1395
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:54,672
Things work out.

1396
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:55,907
Yeah.

1397
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,309
Thank God I did
what I did, then.

1398
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,678
Uh, would you guys like
to start with still

1399
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:01,846
or, uh, sparkling water?

1400
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,481
-Oh, let's go sparkling.
-Uh, spar-- Yeah.

1401
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,749
-(stammers, laughs)
-Yeah? You like sparkling?

1402
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,984
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1403
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:07,185
Yeah. Oh, can we get
some more bread, too?

1404
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,286
-Usually go still.
-You know?

1405
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,754
Last time I came here,
it came out hot.

1406
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,522
-Yeah.
-It was-- oh, it was perfect.

1407
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,857
It's like my mom made it.
(chuckles)

1408
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:13,858
Sure.

1409
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,293
Sparkling and hot bread.

1410
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:16,995
All right. Thanks, buddy.

1411
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,968
Oh, you just can't spit
on that like that, man.

1412
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,470
You got to be crafty.
You can't just go out at, like--

1413
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:26,837
You got to,
you got to maneuver.

1414
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,140
Lick on it or put a boogie
in it or something.

1415
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,309
You think I can fit
this whole thing in my ass?

1416
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:33,311
If, uh, you really
put your mind to it, bro.

1417
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:39,484
Hey, I saw him spit
in the bread.

1418
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,322
All right, scorching hot bread.

1419
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:45,957
-RAY: Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

1420
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,792
Your mom's in the john.
Have a seat.

1421
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,328
Oh, don't worry, you're not
gonna get in trouble.

1422
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,862
Just for a minute.

1423
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:53,431
All right.

1424
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:59,237
So... how, uh, how you liking
the job here?

1425
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,872
Uh, it eats ass.

1426
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,243
You know, I remember I--
Back in the day,

1427
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:07,145
I used to work at that, uh,
you know that pizza parlor

1428
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,613
-down there on Main Street?
-Mm.

1429
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,515
You remember the one? Yeah.
I-I used to work down there.

1430
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:13,218
I loved it.
You know, making the pizzas.

1431
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,885
Girls would come in, you know.

1432
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,222
It's like they just
had to talk to me.

1433
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:18,223
Yeah.

1434
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:19,757
Well, that's awesome.

1435
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,994
I'm glad you got laid a lot
at your pizza place.

1436
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,265
All right. (sighs)
Listen, Scott.

1437
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:30,068
I-I know this is weird, okay?

1438
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,703
You and your mom were alone
together for a long time.

1439
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:35,173
You got set in your ways,
you know?

1440
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,208
You got used to things.

1441
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:38,676
But I don't know,
I just feel like

1442
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,511
your mother deserves
more right now.

1443
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,514
And I'm serious, I really think
that I can make her happy,

1444
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,716
and she makes me happy.

1445
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,286
So, I mean, that-that's
a good thing, right?

1446
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,688
Yeah. Yeah, I think
it's a great thing.

1447
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,624
I... I want my mom to be happy
more than anything, so...

1448
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,193
Good. I do, too.

1449
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,462
So, uh, what's your sport?

1450
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,564
-Uh, I like basketball.
-Oh, yeah?

1451
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,565
-Mm-hmm.
-What position?

1452
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:01,799
Uh, I played small forward.

1453
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,068
-Small forward.
-Yeah.

1454
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:04,702
All right. I'm kind of
a baseball guy myself.

1455
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,037
-Oh, yeah?
-You like, uh...

1456
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,305
I'm an old man.
I like that stuff.

1457
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:08,706
I got season tickets
to the Yankees.

1458
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,408
-No way. Really? That's cool.
-Yeah.

1459
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,642
I think it's
Staten Island's year.

1460
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:13,578
Oh, Staten Island Yankees.

1461
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,946
-Minor League.
-Oh, absolutely.

1462
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,449
I'm not gonna go pay to see
those overpaid crybabies.

1463
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,551
They try harder
at the Minor League level.

1464
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,287
Plus, I'm a Red Sox fan.
I'm never setting foot

1465
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,888
-in that stadium.
-Well, I-I should get back

1466
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,723
to work, uh,
before I get yelled at.

1467
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,957
-Okay. Go ahead.
-So, yeah.

1468
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:28,426
-Absolutely. All right.
-All right, man.

1469
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,428
Uh, enjoy the hot bread.

1470
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,429
-MARGIE: Hey.
-Okay, cool.

1471
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,463
Hey.

1472
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:34,065
What are you fellas
talking about?

1473
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,900
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh, I was just asking Scott

1474
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,103
if he wanted to go
to a Yankee game sometime.

1475
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,105
Oh, what did Scott say?

1476
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,842
S-Scott... Scott said yeah.

1477
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,644
SCOTT: All right,
who's fighting tonight?!

1478
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,413
I want to fight somebody!

1479
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,847
Oh, I'm sorry, Pepe.

1480
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,916
Don't take this personally.

-MAN: Oh!

1482
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,654
What happened?

1483
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,689
That was just a jab.

1484
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,158
Oh, it's okay, Pepe.

1485
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,659
-It's all right.
-You s-- You sure?

1486
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:02,893
(groans) Yeah.

1487
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:05,196
I-I mean, I never done that
before, so...

1488
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,298
I feel bad for you.

all the time.

1526
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,923
Oh, thanks for sharing.

1527
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,293
Next time, just say,
"I don't want a hot dog."

1528
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:43,994
All right, I'm just trying
to spread awareness.

1529
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:46,096
(crowd cheering)

1530
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:47,598
RAY:
There we go. There we go.

1531
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,368
-Nice hit. Nice hit.
-Looking good, guys.

1532
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,936
Way to hustle.

1533
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,137
STADIUM ANNOUNCER:
Number 26...

1534
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,573
Hey, uh...

1535
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,875
you ever think about
putting on the jacket?

1536
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,878
-(scoffs) No.
-What are you laughing about?

1537
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,249
'Cause it's
a stupid question, Ray.

1538
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:07,585
-What do you mean, stupid?
-It's fucking stupid.

1539
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,787
Would you ask the kids of that
teacher who blew up in space

1540
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,188
if they want to be an astronaut?

1541
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:13,658
Whoa, I don't think that lady
had any kids, though.

1542
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,060
Yeah, I'm sure she didn't
'cause she died in space.

1543
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,330
It's hard to have kids
when you're dead in space.

1544
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:22,667
Look, I-I could tell you
how I feel about firemen,

1545
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,502
but I-I don't think you guys
want to hear my opinion.

1546
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,437
-No, no, no, please tell us.
-RAY: No, no. No, no, no.

1547
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:28,439
-No. I want to hear it.
-You don't got to do this, man.

1548
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:29,807
-Come on.
-All right, no.

1549
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,309
-Yeah. Okay, how about this?
-Come on, you don't...

1550
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,143
Uh, if you're a fireman,
just don't have kids

1551
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:34,579
or a family at all, okay?

1552
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,414
So that way, you don't
fucking crush them

1553
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,149
when you don't come home
that one time, you know?

1554
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:40,618
And-and you're just so selfish.

1555
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,253
You just hang out
with your boys all day

1556
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:43,688
like it's a fucking frat house.

1557
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,990
Half the time, you're not even
putting out fires.

1558
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:49,093
You're just jerking off,
watching Scarface, okay?

1559
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,095
-All right, take it easy, man.
-No, I'm just saying.

1560
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,997
And it's wrong to tell a kid
that you're gonna be there

1561
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,399
for him for his whole
entire life.

1562
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:57,302
Yeah, but you miss graduation,
your birthdays, okay?

1563
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:58,869
Uh, my d-- my prom dances.

1564
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:01,672
That's a very mean thing
to do to children.

1565
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:02,873
And, uh, if you have a family,

1566
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,174
-y-you're an asshole.
-No, listen, no.

1567
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:05,476
Take it easy, take it easy.

1568
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,478
-Well, that's one way
to look at it. -Yeah.

1569
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:08,813
Tell that to my dad.

1570
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:15,286
Oh, but you can't,
'cause he's dead.

1571
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,488
-Anybody got a good response
to that? -(bat cracks)

1572
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:20,124
-(crowd cheering)
-Yeah!

1573
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,226
Again!

1574
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,328
Whoo!

1575
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:26,464
What a game.
What a game.

1576
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,666
So, what, I shouldn't have kids?

1577
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,535
No, you... you should have kids.

1578
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:31,836
I'm gonna have kids.

1579
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,371
You know, maybe
you should take a cue

1580
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,573
from your shirt, you know?
Smile.

1581
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,409
Lighten up.

1582
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:40,311
(chuckles)
That's actually kind of funny.

1583
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:41,912
Guy's all right.
Why can't you be more like him?

1584
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:43,348
He's all right.

1585
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:45,683
Why can't you not
embarrass me like this?

1586
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,418
I'm sorry.

1587
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:50,054
I'm sorry I embarrassed you
in front of your friends.

1588
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:51,689
(laughs)

1589
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,660
(quietly): And just-just
stick to your guns.

1590
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,061
All right? It'll be fine.

1591
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:58,228
Hey. Hey!

1592
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,263
Come on in.

1593
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:00,998
Come have breakfast with us.

1594
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,734
I made pancakes, and I made
the sausage that you like,

1595
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:04,769
an omelet.

1596
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,036
Come, come, come, come sit.

1597
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,205
RAY:
Man, these eggs are spectacular.

1598
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:10,341
With the onions and the peppers.

1599
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:13,243
I love it. I love it.
(sniffs)

1600
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:17,281
Did, uh, did he
sp-spend the night?

1601
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:18,916
MARGIE:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1602
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,418
He slept here.

1603
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:21,452
In this house.

1604
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:23,287
I'm an adult. I can do that.

1605
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,255
(chuckles)

1606
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,692
I-I need to talk to you
about something.

1607
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,093
Okay.

1608
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,895
I was thinking that it's time

1609
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,863
to think about
getting your own apartment.

1610
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:34,465
What?

1611
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:36,300
W-Why would you say that?

1612
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:38,068
Well...

1613
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:41,572
You are so awesome.

1614
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:45,576
And I think I've been there
for you too much.

1615
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,546
'Cause sometimes in life,
the thing that's motivating

1616
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,048
is when people don't have
that safety net.

1617
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,917
Right, right,
but I need that safety net

1618
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,318
'cause I don't have
my shit together.

1619
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:56,153
So, like, uh,
w-why are you doing this?

1620
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,555
Is this 'cause of him?

1621
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,157
No.

1622
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,960
It's just you're
24 years old now.

1623
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,764
24. I mean, Phelps had
a fistful of gold medals by 24.

1624
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,766
Why are you talking?

1625
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,235
I'm just giving you
some perspective, that's all.

1626
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,671
You know, Wayne Gretzky had,
like, 96 goals when he was 24.

1627
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,773
W-What?

1628
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,975
RAY: Roger Staubach
graduated West Point,

1629
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,245
won a Heisman Trophy,
fought in the Vietnam War,

1630
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,648
and then joined the Cowboys
by the time he was 24.

1631
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:26,851
I don't know who that is,
so, s-so who-who gives a fuck?

1632
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:29,153
I think that maybe
you're-you're ready

1633
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,155
and you just don't even know it.

1634
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:33,591
So, you're kicking me out?

1635
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:34,992
No, no.

1636
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,428
I just want you to get
your own apartment by summer.

1637
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,464
Right, so you're kicking me
out of the house.

1638
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,466
That's nine months from now.

1639
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,501
I mean, you-you could have
a baby in nine months.

1640
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:44,835
It's a long time.

1641
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,771
Are you moving in?
Are you trying to push me out?

1642
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,973
What, like, what did I do?
I-I thought we were cool.

1643
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:50,975
Scott, Scott, let's all
be adults here. Come on.

1644
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,511
Your mother has worked
very hard for a very long time.

1645
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,179
And I'm gonna retire
in a couple years,

1646
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:59,049
so things are gonna change
around here, but in a good way.

1647
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:01,486
I mean, w-we think you--
that you can do great things.

1648
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,953
Yeah, I know I'm gonna do
great things.

1649
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,523
But, like, I don't need you
to tell me that, like...

1650
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:06,857
This is-- What's going on?

1651
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:08,959
This is-- I-I...

1652
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,495
I don't like this.

1653
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:12,497
So, be that as it may,
(chuckles)

1654
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,499
until you leave--
which is gonna be good for you

1655
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:15,733
and it's gonna be motivating--

1656
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:17,234
you're gonna have to
pull your weight

1657
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,736
a little more around here.

1658
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,906
And one thing that we thought
would help you contribute--

1659
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,374
would be easy,
wouldn't be hard to do--

1660
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:27,745
is to help Ray bring his kids
back and forth to school

1661
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,748
when he can't do it
because of work.

1662
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,817
Like now.

1663
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,251
Like today.

1664
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,886
(chuckles)

1665
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,222
You're joking, right?

1666
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:41,058
You want me to take
your kid to school?

1667
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,093
The kid that I tattooed?

1668
00:57:43,227 --> 00:57:46,430
I got two kids.
The other one's seven.

1669
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,232
You're gonna make me
babysit your kids?

1670
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:51,101
Do-- I'm on-- I do drugs.

1671
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,871
Well, looks like you're walking.

1672
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,873
And thank you.

1673
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:58,876
I'm not cool with
any of this, okay?

1674
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:00,778
And-and where do you
expect me to live?

1675
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,279
And w-with what money?
(stammers)

1676
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,114
You know I'm a fucking bum,
right?

1677
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,350
Yo, this is fucked up!
Seriously.

1678
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,487
Especially after last night,
all that bonding boy bullshit.

1679
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,523
You're full of shit, man.

1680
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:14,458
You're a fucking liar.

1681
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,294
I'm gonna go walk your kids.

1682
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,697
No, I'm not fucking
letting you take 'em.

1683
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,932
Fuck you.
Who the fuck are you?

1684
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,634
SCOTT: Yeah, I-I agree
with you completely.

1685
00:58:23,768 --> 00:58:25,302
Why-- 'cause that--
It was Ray's idea.

1686
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:26,871
I don't think I should be
taking them, either.

1687
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,038
I agree with you.

1688
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,042
Are you a weirdo?

1689
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,443
Oh, the weirdest.

1690
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:35,045
Nobody's weirder than me.

1691
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,447
See, a weirdo wouldn't say that.

1692
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:39,416
A weirdo would deny it.

1693
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,753
So, do I have to take 'em or...?

1694
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,155
(exhales sharply)

1695
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,223
Yes.

1696
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,392
God, no.

1697
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,227
I mean, (scoffs)
Ray was supposed to do it.

1698
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,629
I can't fucking do it.

1699
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:53,263
Their schools start
half an hour apart

1700
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:54,799
on the other side of town.

1701
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:56,601
(Gina sighs)

1702
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:02,673
So, your mom is banging my ex?

1703
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:04,809
Yeah, I'm not thrilled
about it, either.

1704
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:07,477
Yeah, well, you shouldn't be.

1705
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:09,647
-(sighs)
-Harold. Kelly.

1706
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,181
Come here. Come here.

1707
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:14,184
There's something,
something kind of fun.

1708
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:15,620
Come here. Come here.

1709
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:17,421
-Oh, hey, man.
-(clears throat)

1710
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,591
So, this is Harold,
and this is Kelly.

1711
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:23,160
And, uh, this is...

1712
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,763
Scott.

1713
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,932
Scott. He's gonna be
taking care of you.

1714
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,134
-Okay? It...
-Nice to meet you, Scott.

1715
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,336
Hi, Harold.
It's nice to meet you.

1716
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,104
For the very first time.

1717
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,940
GINA:
If he does anything weird,

1718
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,274
you tell me.

1719
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,310
Even if he tells you
not to tell me, you tell me.

1720
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:44,348
I'm pretty sure he's not weird,
but I could be wrong.

1721
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,449
'Kay?

1722
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,617
-Love you.
-Okay.

1723
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:47,685
-Love you, Mom.
-Seriously.

1724
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,119
Love you, Mom. Bye.

1725
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,320
Pay attention.

1726
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:52,690
Got it.

1727
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,825
GINA:
Hold both their hands!

1728
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,030
Thank you.

1729
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,466
Look both ways. Look both ways!

1730
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,534
(quietly):
Tell her to stop.

1731
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:07,037
God!

1732
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,173
So, w-what do you like
to do, Harold?

1733
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,541
I like superheroes.

1734
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:13,410
Well, so does everybody.

1735
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,245
No, I make up my own.

1736
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,081
Oh, yeah? What kind?

1737
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:18,582
Ice Flash.

1738
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,851
What does he do?

1739
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:25,222
He freezes stuff
and shoots ice at people.

1740
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,192
Oh, well, that's not gonna work.

1741
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:29,459
Why not?

1742
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:31,361
I could just use a hair dryer
and ruin him.

1743
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:33,030
(stammers)
Keep thinking, though.

1744
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:35,032
What do you got?
What do you like to do?

1745
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:37,067
-I like to sing.
-You do?

1746
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:39,069
Could-could you sing for me?

1747
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:40,537
Sure.

1748
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:44,341
* Oh, what a beautiful morning *

1749
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,342
Yes.

1750
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,345
* Oh, what a beautiful day *

1751
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,346
All right.

1752
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:53,884
* I've got a wonderful feeling *

1753
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:57,521
* Everything's going my way. *

1754
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,223
That shit was dope.
High five.

1755
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:00,490
She's a good singer.

1756
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,727
I don't agree with
the sentiment of the song,

1757
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,428
but it was really great.

1758
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:07,597
Anyway, have a great day
at school.

1759
01:01:07,732 --> 01:01:10,200
Uh... I hope it's not shitty,

1760
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,137
and, um, yeah, give your,
uh, sister a kiss goodbye.

1761
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,773
-We don't do that.
-Just do it.

1762
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,611
-See? Wasn't that nice?
-(school bell ringing)

1763
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:23,613
Now, if she dies tomorrow,
you'll remember that,

1764
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:24,982
that you kissed her goodbye.

1765
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,650
Have a good day at school.

1766
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,286
-Later, man.
-Pay attention.

1767
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,722
-Why would I die?
-I don't know.

1768
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,290
You never know
what's gonna happen.

1769
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,059
Think you're immortal?

1770
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:39,764
This. It's this one.

1771
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,766
Okay. All right.

1772
01:01:41,899 --> 01:01:43,600
(kids chattering)

1773
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:45,836
Well, have a good day, okay?

1774
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,471
-KELLY: Okay.
-I'll see you soon, I guess.

1775
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:49,639
-Can-can I help you?
-Oh, hi.

1776
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,008
I'm-I'm Ray's friend.

1777
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,377
I was just here
to bring her here.

1778
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,181
-You-you know Ray?
-I know Ray a little bit.

1779
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,583
He's kind of, like,
banging my mom. (chuckles)

1780
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,151
-(chuckles)
-So, yeah, I'm just, you know,

1781
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:02,186
just dropping her off.

1782
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,188
Did you sign in at the office?

1783
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,290
No. I didn't even know
you had an office.

1784
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:08,325
Okay, um...

1785
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,860
Kelly? You okay?

1786
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,295
Yeah.

1787
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:12,662
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1788
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:14,264
You know you can tell me.

1789
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,133
I'm okay.

1790
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,534
Do you know him?

1791
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,635
Yeah, kind of.

1792
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,704
He's a new friend.

1793
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,773
Okay.

1794
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:24,842
Oh, I trained her in the car.
She's not gonna break.

1795
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,176
-(chuckles nervously)
-I'm just kidding.

1796
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,845
It's, uh...
I'm not gonna hurt her.

1797
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:29,613
Um, but have a great day.
I just...

1798
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,216
No, uh, actually, could you,
uh, set up the paints?

1799
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,650
-No.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1800
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:35,019
-Uh, and just wash
these brushes. -No.

1801
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,286
-Thank you so much.
-No. No.

1802
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,388
-Thank you!
-No.

1803
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,524
(hard rock music playing)

1804
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,763
(tattoo gun buzzing)

1805
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,575
Did-did you happen
to get a chance

1806
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,145
-to take a look at the, uh...
-Yeah, I looked at your book.

1807
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,314
I mean, I drew like that, too,
when I was 14.

1808
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,884
From what I saw, you don't
really have the basics,

1809
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,819
so you got to figure that out.

1810
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,254
Well, yeah, that's why I'm here.

1811
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:12,589
I mean, I was hoping
I can learn from you.

1812
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,025
Right, well, um,
you'd be my apprentice.

1813
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,526
Uh, you'll be a slave
to the shop.

1814
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,229
-Hey, man. As long as I get
to tattoo people, right? -No.

1815
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:21,866
Never. Until I say.

1816
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,334
Uh, you'll be sterilizing
needles, washing my car,

1817
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,535
taking the trash out.

1818
01:03:25,669 --> 01:03:27,237
I mean, you're basically
our bitch.

1819
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:29,039
So, how much will I be,
like, making here?

1820
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:31,008
-Dick.
-Dick.

1821
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,509
Okay, well...

1822
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,912
It's a long line of people
who want this job, man.

1823
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:37,381
How do I, like, pay my rent?

1824
01:03:37,514 --> 01:03:41,451
(exhales sharply) That one
right there is not my problem.

1825
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:42,953
It's your first day,
you're already complaining.

1826
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:44,088
It's kind of weird, huh?

1827
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:45,890
Yeah, let's not do this.

1828
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:48,025
You should take a walk.

1829
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,627
-Pussy.
-All right.

1830
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,629
Well, could I ask you
a question?

1831
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,064
If I did work here?

1832
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:55,365
Why is he still here?

1833
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,201
Let's say some idiot
walks in, right?

1834
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,203
And he wants to get a tattoo
of a Confederate flag

1835
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,604
wrapped around the Grim Reaper.

1836
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:02,372
You could tell that guy
to go fuck himself, right?

1837
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:04,141
'Cause that's a ridiculous
tattoo to ask for.

1838
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:06,743
SHOP OWNER: It's not my place
to judge people, man.

1839
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,245
I don't do that.

1840
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:10,480
Well, what if another guy
walked in and he wanted to get

1841
01:04:10,614 --> 01:04:12,116
a tattoo of his dead friend
James on his chest, right?

1842
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:13,884
But you know James,
and you don't want

1843
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:15,886
to give him the tattoo,
'cause you know James

1844
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,154
and he's an asshole
and that the world's

1845
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:18,388
better off without him.

1846
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:19,756
-What do you do then?
-You have a death wish?

1847
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:20,857
No, I don't have a death wish.

1848
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,792
But that lady
on the motorcycle does.

1849
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:24,261
She's not even wearing
any underwear.

1850
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:25,930
-She's gonna burn her pussy.
-Do you want to do this?

1851
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,231
You really want
to fucking do this?

1852
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,398
I don't want to do
anything with you.

1853
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,433
I just want to know
who killed James.

1854
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:30,600
Was it the Confederate flag man?

1855
01:04:30,734 --> 01:04:32,269
Was it the motorcycle lady?

1856
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:35,339
I got to be honest, Kelsey, you
look exactly like your picture.

1857
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,975
You're kind of thicker,
more robust.

1858
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,476
(laughs):
Oh, thank you.

1859
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,744
-Yeah.
-It's a compliment.

1860
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,780
You look a little bit like
Antonio Banderas,

1861
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:45,082
if I squint really hard.

1862
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,350
Oh, please squint
all night long.

1863
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:47,817
-(laughs)
-That's great.

1864
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,419
-Chelsea, you are-- I mean,
Kelsey, I'm sorry. -(laughs)

1865
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:50,754
-Th-That's all right.
It's only... -Yeah, you know.

1866
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,788
What's your name again?

1867
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:52,789
-I forgot already.
-Um, it's Jake.

1868
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:53,790
Sorry about that.

1869
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:54,992
So, uh, w-what do you do?

1870
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,626
KELSEY: Oh, I'm studying
to work in the city.

1871
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,928
-JAKE: Oh.
-Um, I want to make

1872
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,664
Staten Island, like,
a great place again.

1873
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:03,467
Staten Island's already cool.
What are you talking about?

1874
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,102
Yeah, it is. (chuckles)

1875
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,937
-Yeah. Yeah, it is. -You're the
first person here to say that.

1876
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,605
JAKE:
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1877
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:09,773
It's the best place on Earth.

1878
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,608
Well, at least
on the East Coast, I think.

1879
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,776
Excuse me.

1880
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,012
Oh, hey.

1881
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,013
-Hey.
-Hi.

1882
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:18,148
-Hello.
-Hey.

1883
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,351
-Hey.
-Hey.

1884
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,488
Uh, would you guys like,
uh, still or sparkling water?

1885
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:27,191
Um, you pick.

1886
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:28,725
Uh, I'm more of a sparkling guy,

1887
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:29,859
-so sparkling.
-Sparkling it is.

1888
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:31,328
But I do like tequila,
so if I could

1889
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,197
get just a Patrón, you know,
with a rock.

1890
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,199
-That cool with you?
-That's fine. Yeah, that's fine.

1891
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:36,733
-Yeah? Cool. Yeah,
I prefer a tequila. -Cool.

1892
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:38,668
Tequila and rock. You guys
want, like, warm bread or...

1893
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:41,305
uh, olive oil?

1894
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,007
JAKE:
Warm bread.

1895
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,741
Oh.

1896
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,978
-Bro, did you scare off another
customer? -(Scott sighs)

1897
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:49,646
What's wrong with you?

1898
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,348
I'm so sorry about that.

1899
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,850
He has, like, nepotism,
you know?

1900
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:55,185
Is that a disease?

1901
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,354
Yeah, it's a bad one.

1902
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:58,922
I brought that guy here
to make you jealous.

1903
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,024
You could give a fuck.

1904
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,758
T-To make me jea...

1905
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,927
-You don't seem jealous
or upset at all. -I do care.

1906
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:05,362
Of course I care.

1907
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,763
I chose the hottest guy
on Tinder.

1908
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,165
Look at me. Look at me.

1909
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,299
Look at my tits.

1910
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:10,700
There is literally
the Eiffel Tower--

1911
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,036
it's holding them up in here.

1912
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:13,337
You look great. I'm...

1913
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,404
Thank you.

1914
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:15,705
Please don't cry here.
Please.

1915
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,274
You look awful.

1916
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,908
What? What do you mean?
What are you...

1917
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:22,046
Your skin looks see-through and
the circles around your eyes

1918
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:24,281
are so dark you look like
an anorexic panda.

1919
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:26,250
I-- Well, I-I know.

1920
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:27,851
-I know I do.
-I don't know.

1921
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,220
You always look sick and pale
like you have a disease

1922
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,356
but you don't know it yet,
but you literally look like

1923
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,058
if I touched you,
you'd just turn to dust.

1924
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:35,592
I'm sorry.
I-I'm not doing very well.

1925
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,761
-(sighs)
-I-I'm not, you know-- I...

1926
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,629
Well, what do I tell your date?

1927
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,431
I don't know.
Tell him to fuck off.

1928
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:44,268
I met him ten minutes ago.
He's a DJ.

1929
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,905
(sighs)

1930
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,577
HAROLD: Why do you not think
ice is a good superpower?

1931
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,812
It's amazing. I mean...

1932
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,915
Ice Flash can do anything
with his ice.

1933
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:00,584
And it's indestructible

1934
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,119
'cause it's superhero ice.

1935
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:05,555
He can make giant shields
that reflect anything.

1936
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:09,226
He can make giant ice tanks,

1937
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,062
giant ice planes and giant jets,

1938
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:14,331
helicopters that shoot
giant missiles.

1939
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:17,301
I mean, think of
all the possibilities.

1940
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:19,303
SCOTT:
That's actually kind of cool.

1941
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:20,970
-HAROLD: Thanks.
-You came up with that?

1942
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:22,739
Yeah.

1943
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,841
You're getting, like,
really good at this.

1944
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,076
Thanks.

1945
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,011
What color is his shield?

1946
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:30,180
It's, well, the color of ice.

1947
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:32,316
Well, what's the color of ice?
Is it, like, see-through?

1948
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:35,119
Like, light blue ice
or is it like...?

1949
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,187
It's blue ice 'cause it's...

1950
01:07:37,321 --> 01:07:40,090
-it's, like, superhero ice,
and it's cool. -Right.

1951
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:42,092
OSCAR:
You remember that kid Ronnie?

1952
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:44,261
His uncle owns the pharmacy.

1953
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,663
He gave me the key.
We're gonna load up on oxys.

1954
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,132
So, we're robbers now.
That's our future.

1955
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:50,700
Nah. Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We're gonna do this one time.

1956
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,802
Get the money
to seed our dreams.

1957
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,338
Get that venture capital.

1958
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,873
Open that tattoo restaurant
you wanted.

1959
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,775
It's not that big a deal.
Jay-Z did it.

1960
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,844
He sold crack
to fund his rap career.

1961
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:02,879
Aren't most of Jay-Z's friends,
like, dead or in jail?

1962
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,515
Yeah, but we're Jay-Z
in this situation.

1963
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:07,517
We're not Jay-Z's friends.

1964
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,986
We can't all be Jay-Z.

1965
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,522
There can't be four Jay-Zs.
That doesn't make any sense.

1966
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:13,890
You guys know I'd do anything
for you, right?

1967
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:14,958
OSCAR:
Thank you.

1968
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,493
-Appreciate you.
-Just not this. I'm out.

1969
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:17,894
OSCAR:
What are you talking about?

1970
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,563
-RICHIE: What?
-This is crazy.

1971
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,565
Hey, we need you, all right?
You're the lookout.

1972
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,167
Literally anybody
can be the lookout.

1973
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,901
-I don't need to be a part of
this. -No, no, no, no, no, no.

1974
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,703
We need you.
You're our best friend.

1975
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,037
-We trust you.
-Wha--

1976
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:29,906
Well, best friends
don't make other best friends

1977
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,641
do stupid illegal shit.

1978
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,643
You make me do stupid shit
for you all the time.

1979
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,379
-Like what?
-Uh, I don't know.

1980
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:36,646
What about the time
when you thought

1981
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,881
-you had testicular cancer?
-Here we go.

1982
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:39,249
-Knew this was gonna come up.
-All right?

1983
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:41,985
And then I drive over
and you make me touch your nuts.

1984
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,321
I would've done it for you, bro.

1985
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,323
You're like, "Hey, yo, there's
something wrong with my ass."

1986
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,024
-I'd be like, "Yo, bend over."
-Come on.

1987
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,926
After everything
we've done for you?

1988
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,261
IGOR:
What do you do for me?

1989
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:52,862
I let you tattoo my whole body.

1990
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:54,331
So what?
You love my tattoos.

1991
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,032
You use me
as a human sketchbook.

1992
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,734
I-I-I-I don't, really.

1993
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,003
I don't.
Not as much as I say I do.

1994
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,339
I'm out of here. My bad.

1995
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:04,674
You know what?

1996
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,942
You're a real bitch!

1997
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,444
-You're a bitch!
-IGOR: Shh.

1998
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,513
OSCAR:
Yo, don't shush me.

1999
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,047
-RAY: Oh. -MARGIE: My God,
look how excited she is.

2000
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,283
-RAY: I'm assuming that's her.
-I started running too early!

2001
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:14,884
-(laughs)
-(squeals)

2002
01:09:15,018 --> 01:09:16,853
(Margie and Claire laughing)

2003
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,055
Hey! Oh.

2004
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,557
Oh, oh, oh, you're so skinny.

2005
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,791
-Have you been eating?
-Yeah.

2006
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:23,059
-Hi.
-Hey.

2007
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:25,195
How are you?

2008
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:26,463
This is Ray.

2009
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:27,731
-Hey. How you doing?
-CLAIRE: Oh.

2010
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:29,132
-Nice to finally meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

2011
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:30,467
Yeah, I feel like
I already know you.

2012
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,968
Your mom talks about you
all the time.

2013
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,870
-Oh, God. (laughs)
-Oh.

2014
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,939
No, only good stuff,
only good stuff.

2015
01:09:36,072 --> 01:09:38,575
Should we go eat? I am so sick
of eating off a tray.

2016
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,210
-You hungry?
-Yeah, I could eat.

2017
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,279
-Could always eat.
-Uh-huh.

2018
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:43,480
RAY:
Beautiful school.

2019
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:45,815
"Yeah, I could eat.
I could always eat."

2020
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,116
Fucking asshole.

2021
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:48,918
RAY:
Look at those two angels, huh?

2022
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:50,454
-SCOTT: Yeah, I know them.
-Yeah. -(women exclaiming)

2023
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:52,489
-Mm-hmm. -You walk them to
school, don't you? -(chuckles)

2024
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:53,890
-Yeah, I know who they are.
-CLAIRE: Oh, my God.

2025
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,626
-She's so cute.
-Look. Look at those curls.

2026
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,295
We took them to see
Stomp Off-Broadway.

2027
01:09:58,428 --> 01:09:59,796
-They went crazy!
-JOANNE: Oh, my God.

2028
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:00,930
I love Stomp.

2029
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:02,666
What's Stomp? What is that?

2030
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:03,833
It's the greatest musical
of all time.

2031
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,101
JOANNE: Yeah, it's, like,
that show where

2032
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:06,936
people play the drums
on, like, garbage cans

2033
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,805
and, like, tap with broomsticks.

2034
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,139
-Stuff around the house.
-Yeah.

2035
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:11,608
-(drums on table)
-Like, you just see a toaster,

2036
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,076
we make an English muffin.

2037
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,745
-They-they see a whole song.
It's incredible. -(laughter)

2038
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,681
I know a homeless guy
that plays trash can lids

2039
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:19,683
on the subway, for a dollar.

2040
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,519
And then he took a shit
on the platform.

2041
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,621
Oh. Well, you know.

2042
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:27,090
I don't know if he's gonna get
a Tony for that, but...

2043
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,158
Maybe if they keep practicing
and get an adult diaper,

2044
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:31,961
they can, uh, get
to Broadway someday.

2045
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,797
(laughter)

2046
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,131
-JOANNE: Yeah.
-(Margie chuckles)

2047
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:37,200
So, are you guys really serious?

2048
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:38,835
Uh-oh.

2049
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:41,471
-(Claire chuckles)
-Well, actually,

2050
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:46,476
I'm going up to Boston to meet
his parents at Thanksgiving.

2051
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,778
-Oh. -SCOTT: What?
You're going to Boston to--

2052
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:50,680
for Thanksgiving? To wha--

2053
01:10:50,814 --> 01:10:52,015
Well, where-where am I gonna go?

2054
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,483
-Ah, you'll come. You can come.
-CLAIRE: Yeah, me, too.

2055
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:55,552
-We can all go. -Yeah, we'd
love to have you up there. -Oh.

2056
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,487
You think you're gonna get
married again? (chuckles)

2057
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:59,523
Oh, boy,
look what I got us into.

2058
01:10:59,656 --> 01:11:01,057
-Claire.
-(Claire chuckles)

2059
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,392
RAY:
Well, you know what? I'll...

2060
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:04,561
I'll, uh, I'll answer that,
you know?

2061
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,796
A couple of months ago,
I would've said no, but...

2062
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,732
Uh, can we go?

2063
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:09,733
MARGIE:
Scott.

2064
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,734
Don't be rude.

2065
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:11,968
Me? I'm not being rude.

2066
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,403
He's talking the entire time.

2067
01:11:13,537 --> 01:11:14,538
Wha-- He's the one being rude.

2068
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:15,772
RAY:
Was just making conversation.

2069
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,273
MARGIE: Okay, so what
did you want to say?

2070
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:19,142
-Cut this shit. -Tell us now.
-SCOTT: All I wanted to say

2071
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,744
was I think
it's time to go, okay?

2072
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,379
I had a great time.
This is wonderful.

2073
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:23,580
I think we all bonded.

2074
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,815
It's time to leave now,
all right?

2075
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,484
Well, we're going
to a party later,

2076
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,052
if you want to come with us.

2077
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:30,454
You just can't embarrass me.

2078
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,188
Sure, whatever. Let's just
get the fuck out of here.

2079
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:36,760
He's in a good mood.

2080
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:39,763
Try doing it your entire life.

2081
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:40,997
("Uproar" by Lil Wayne
featuring Swizz Beatz playing)

2082
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,566
-We're gonna have a good night.
-Oh, yeah.

2083
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:44,434
No, we're not.
I hate college parties.

2084
01:11:44,568 --> 01:11:46,269
You've never been
to a college party.

2085
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:47,837
Come on, just enjoy it.

2086
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,574
-Relax. Go with it, okay?
-Yes, relax.

2087
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:53,076
* Five, four, three, two,
I let one go, bow *

2088
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:55,178
* Get the fuck, though,
I don't bluff, bro *

2089
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,614
* Aiming at your head
like a buffalo *

2090
01:11:57,747 --> 01:12:00,717
* What the fuck, though?
Where the love go... *

2091
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,918
What's your major?

2092
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:05,054
It's, uh, uh,
evolutionary sociology

2093
01:12:05,188 --> 01:12:07,591
with-with a splash of bio.

2094
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:09,793
Oh. I-I didn't know
you could do that.

2095
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:12,061
Yeah, you can do whatever the
fuck you want. It's college.

2096
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:14,398
* I don't huff, though,
yellow diamonds up close *

2097
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:15,699
* Catch a sunstroke *

2098
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,702
* At your front door
with a gun stowed *

2099
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,404
* Put the green in the bag
like a lawn mower *

2100
01:12:20,537 --> 01:12:22,572
* Hair trigger pulled back
like a cornrow *

2101
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:25,074
* What the fuck, bro?
Where the love go? *

2102
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,810
I like your tattoos.

2103
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:28,311
I'm an actress,
so, like, I don't think

2104
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:29,779
I can get that many tattoos,
because, like,

2105
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:32,148
what if I get cast as, like,
an angelic role?

2106
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,584
Like, I'm kind of, like,
a young Winona Ryder.

2107
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:37,554
So, like, I could play those
parts, and, like, also, like,

2108
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,088
back when Shakespeare was
writing plays, like...

2109
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:40,624
* Five, four, three, two,
I let one go *

2110
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:43,159
* Bow, get the fuck, though,
I don't bluff, bro *

2111
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,128
* Aiming at your head
like a buffalo *

2112
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:47,263
-What do you think?
-What is that?

2113
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,066
It's a butthole.

2114
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,601
-Get it?
-Oh, my God.

2115
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,170
* What the fuck, though?
Where the love go? *

2116
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,605
* Oh! *

2117
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:57,340
-Uh-huh. -So, we're talking
about how the one percent

2118
01:12:57,474 --> 01:12:59,409
keeps, like, getting bigger
and bigger and bigger,

2119
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:02,679
and the wealth inequality
is just out of control,

2120
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:06,349
and we can't continue
with capitalism this way.

2121
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:08,752
Yeah, I'm s--
I'm sick of the rat race.

2122
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,754
Yeah, no, exactly.

2123
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,321
Like, what happened
to the American dream?

2124
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:15,191
I know. It's like
an American nightmare now.

2125
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:16,926
-(laughs): Oh, my--
Yeah, exa... -Right?

2126
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:20,296
* What the fuck, though?
Where the love go? *

2127
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:22,432
* Five, four, three, two,
I let one go, bow *

2128
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,267
-Bring it-- Oh, shit!
-Oh! Oh, shit!

2129
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,535
Oh, shit!

2130
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:28,171
(shouting frantically)

2131
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:29,439
That was fucking fun.

2132
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:31,207
(laughs):
I know. It was so fun.

2133
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,809
Yeah, like, I feel like,

2134
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,978
I feel like I kind of fit in
for once, you know?

2135
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:37,046
And not everybody hated me
for the first time.

2136
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,682
You should come here.

2137
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,884
Yeah? You think I can
get into a place like this?

2138
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,719
I mean, you'd need a good GPA.

2139
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:44,220
Yeah, well, I don't have
a good one of those.

2140
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,689
I-I didn't even
graduate high school.

2141
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:47,123
Don't you have to graduate
high school to go to college?

2142
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,958
Yeah, but it's not, like,
too late to do that.

2143
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,661
All right, even so, you know,
I-I'm a little too old.

2144
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:53,296
I'd look like a narc, you know?

2145
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,798
I would look creepy
in the corner.

2146
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,966
-Everybody'd be like, "What's
that guy doing here?" -(scoffs)

2147
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,202
Everybody here is so old.

2148
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:00,837
All right, well, I'm fucking
stupid, Claire, okay?

2149
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,305
Is that what you want me to say?

2150
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,641
I can't pay attention.
I can't sit still, okay?

2151
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,242
I'm stupid.
I'm a dumb idiot.

2152
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,377
I would have to work ten times
harder than those people.

2153
01:14:08,512 --> 01:14:09,913
And everybody would
fucking make fun of me,

2154
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:12,516
and I'm not ready to deal with
that again, all right? So, no.

2155
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:13,517
So, that's it?

2156
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,752
Huh?

2157
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,186
That's how long
you're gonna think about

2158
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,588
going to college for?

2159
01:14:18,722 --> 01:14:20,189
I mean, that was, like,
a 40-second walk.

2160
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:21,825
Uh, that's a lot of
consideration, don't you think?

2161
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,426
Okay.

2162
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,529
-It's your journey.
-Indeed.

2163
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:28,164
Now, let's get down
to brass tacks, all right?

2164
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,599
W-What are we gonna do
about Ray?

2165
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,501
-What do you mean?
-Don't act stupid.

2166
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:34,771
I mean, h-how are we gonna,
you know,

2167
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,439
get Mom to break up with him?

2168
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,074
I think he seems fine.

2169
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,209
-You think he's fine?
-What do you want?

2170
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:42,378
It's Mom's choice to make.
We don't need to get involved.

2171
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:44,447
Yeah, I know, but we should
still protect her.

2172
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:45,649
She can't just be with

2173
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:47,584
the first guy
she's been with since Dad.

2174
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,418
She got to, like,
peruse some dick.

2175
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,290
Mom doesn't need to peruse dick.

2176
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,359
-You know she needs to.
-I think she seems happy.

2177
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,062
You want her to have sex
with a ton of people?

2178
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,297
No, but, yeah, kind of.

2179
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,766
-I mean...
-That's gross.

2180
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,101
Well, if you knew something
was bad before it even started,

2181
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,203
wouldn't you stop it
if you had the chance?

2182
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,405
It's like that whole
baby Hitler thing, you know?

2183
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:12,041
If you had the chance to kill
baby Hitler before it grew up,

2184
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,342
wouldn't you do it?

2185
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:15,078
Wouldn't you strangle it
until its eyes popped out?

2186
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,880
So, Ray's baby Hitler?

2187
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,782
Yeah. In this situation,
he is, yeah.

2188
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:20,049
He's baby Hitler.

2189
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,285
So, do you want to help me
kill baby Hitler?

2190
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:25,088
Okay, you're right, Scott.
You're right.

2191
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:27,624
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Claire!

2192
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,559
Claire!

2193
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:36,165
(music playing faintly
over headphones)

2194
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,466
Tell you,
Claire really seems like

2195
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:39,769
she's enjoying school, you know?

2196
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,270
Yeah.

2197
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:44,440
She's just blossoming.

2198
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:46,009
Yeah.

2199
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:48,277
Girl just seems like
she could take on the world.

2200
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:49,545
-(chuckles)
-I'll tell you,

2201
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,448
whatever you did with her,
you did it right.

2202
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:54,784
Dump some of that on Scott,
you know?

2203
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:01,490
What do you think about
his tattoo restaurant idea?

2204
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,593
I think it's terrible.

2205
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:05,929
Getting a tattoo is like, uh--
it's a medical procedure.

2206
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,631
You don't want to go
to the hospital

2207
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:09,766
and order supper, you know?

2208
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:14,604
I just love that he has big
dreams, but he's just so lost.

2209
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:16,439
I mean, no matter how much I try

2210
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,842
to fill him with good energy,
he just...

2211
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,344
he's got no self-esteem.

2212
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:24,447
He's really going nowhere.

2213
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,650
RAY:
Don't be so hard on yourself.

2214
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:28,151
Scientists have been
doing studies.

2215
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,186
They say a lot
of this stuff is genetic.

2216
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,321
You know, you inherit it
from your grandparents.

2217
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:33,723
So blame them.

2218
01:16:40,864 --> 01:16:42,098
* When *

2219
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,737
* When *

2220
01:16:47,871 --> 01:16:49,505
OSCAR:
Let's go.

2221
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,642
* When... *

2222
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:54,510
RICHIE:
Right. If anybody sees us

2223
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:58,514
or you hear sirens or anything
bad, you text me, "You up?"

2224
01:16:58,648 --> 01:16:59,916
Could I just text you
something else?

2225
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:02,151
That sounds like I'm trying
to bang you, kind of.

2226
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,220
-Just do it.
-Fine.

2227
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,155
-Fine.
-Let's go.

2228
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:07,724
-Let's roll.
-Hold on.

2229
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,425
All right, let's go.

2230
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,526
SCOTT:
Good luck, homey.

2231
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,295
Love you, Scott.

2232
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,335
SCOTT:
Oh, shit.

2233
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,570
This is real.

2234
01:17:21,705 --> 01:17:24,007
(alarm beeping steadily)

2235
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,341
* When *

2236
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,045
(keypad beeping)

2237
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:30,880
(alarm beeps,
steady beeping stops)

2238
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:42,926
Yes! All right.

2239
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:49,232
(video game sound effects
playing quietly)

2240
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,340
You're dead.

2241
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:01,878
MAN:
What's going on?!

2242
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,112
RICHIE:
What the fuck?

2243
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:04,714
-Who are you?!
-You're not supposed to be here.

2244
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:06,382
What are you talking about?!
It's my store!

2245
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,383
WOMAN:
Who are you talking to?

2246
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,452
-Who is that?!
-Go back inside.

2247
01:18:09,585 --> 01:18:11,254
-Go back inside! -What? Don't
tell me to go back inside!

2248
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:12,455
MAN:
I'm handling this!

2249
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:15,124
SCOTT:
Yes. No. Yes.

2250
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:17,493
No. Yes. Yes. No.

2251
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:18,795
Get the fuck out of my store!

2252
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:20,129
-I just don't want
to hurt you, okay? -Get out!

2253
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:21,330
-I just... -You're not
doing this again, okay?!

2254
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:23,099
-This is the third time!
-Enough of you guys!

2255
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:24,400
-Third time this year!
-RICHIE: Shit! Shit!

2256
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,169
-WOMAN: Get out!
-What the hell?

2257
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:28,504
-Get off me!
-MAN: Not today!

2258
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,607
Not today!
Today is Alan Moskowitz's day!

2259
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:37,246
SCOTT:
Well, who's the pretty lady?

2260
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,983
Hello, Angelina Jolie.

2261
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:41,250
(chuckles)

2262
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:43,352
(door rattling)

2263
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:44,954
-Yo, it's locked!
-Where are the keys?

2264
01:18:45,088 --> 01:18:46,455
We left the keys on the counter.

2265
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:47,757
Why'd you lock the door?

2266
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:50,193
Because I didn't want anybody
to come in, man.

2267
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,261
MAN: You're not
gonna do this to me again!

2268
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:53,596
Not in my store!

2269
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,298
-We've never been here before!
-Shit!

2270
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:56,665
(gasping)

2271
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,101
I'm standing my ground!

2272
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,003
-(gunshot)
-(panicked shout)

2273
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:04,607
Fuck.

2274
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,043
Shit!

2275
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:08,477
(groans)

2276
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:10,980
-"You up? You up? You up?"
-(text messages swooshing)

2277
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:12,281
-What's happening?
-Be quiet. Be quiet.

2278
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:13,649
-Be quiet. Be quiet.
-(phone chimes)

2279
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,520
(phone chimes twice)

2280
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:18,955
"Want to fuck? Want to fuck?
Want to fuck? Want to fuck?"

2281
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,723
(grunting):
"Do you want to fuck?

2282
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:22,725
Do you want to fuck?
Do you want to fuck?"

2283
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:25,494
(phone chiming repeatedly)

2284
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:26,562
(panicked shout)

2285
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:27,696
Okay, right, Igor.

2286
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:29,098
-Answer the phone, Igor.
-(line ringing)

2287
01:19:29,232 --> 01:19:30,399
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

2288
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:31,667
(panting)

2289
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33,402
(ringtone playing
The Office theme song)

2290
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,204
(whispering):
No. No. No. No. No.

2291
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:36,205
Scott.

2292
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:38,441
(ringtone continues)

2293
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:41,610
(screams)

2294
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:43,246
(ringtone playing
"Push It" by Salt-N-Pepa)

2295
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:44,547
OSCAR:
Shut off your ringers!

2296
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,682
-Goddamn it.
-(ringtone continues)

2297
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,922
-(line beeps)
-Hey, Oscar, it's, uh, Scott.

2298
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:56,025
I was just, uh, wondering
if, uh, you know,

2299
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,760
you're almost done
with that thing.

2300
01:19:57,894 --> 01:19:59,528
We need those keys.

2301
01:20:05,201 --> 01:20:06,402
(panicked shouts)

2302
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:16,212
Fuck that!

2303
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,347
Holy shit!

2304
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,417
(grunting)

2305
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,052
Come on, Igor!
Come on! Come on!

2306
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:26,422
(sirens wailing)

2307
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:29,058
Um, the robbers are inside!

2308
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,693
Hands in the air!

2309
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,195
The lady inside's got a gun.

2310
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:34,230
OFFICER:
Get down on the ground!

2311
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:35,698
OFFICER 2:
Do not move!

2312
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,401
(siren approaching)

2313
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:40,403
Why would you rob a pharmacy?

2314
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:41,905
SCOTT: I wasn't
robbing a pharmacy, okay?

2315
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:43,772
I was the lookout,
for your information.

2316
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:45,608
The lookout is also
committing a crime.

2317
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:46,910
Are you fucking crazy?

2318
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:48,277
Look, it's all
Ray's fault, okay?

2319
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:49,778
He's trying to kick me out.

2320
01:20:49,913 --> 01:20:51,915
So I panicked
and made a bad decision, okay?

2321
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:52,982
I'm only human!

2322
01:20:53,116 --> 01:20:54,817
A bad decision?
That's a felony.

2323
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,219
Yeah, so?

2324
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,454
I didn't even, I didn't even
go inside, all right?

2325
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,123
Uh, it's not--
(stutters) I'm untouchable.

2326
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:01,790
I didn't do anything, all right?

2327
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:02,959
Uh, i-it's Ray, okay?

2328
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:04,493
He-- I-I know
he's up to something.

2329
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:06,896
-He's trying to erase Dad.
-Can you just let Mom be happy?

2330
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,364
She is happy.

2331
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:10,299
Well, she will be, you know,
once I get rid of that guy.

2332
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:12,568
He's hiding shit, okay?
He's hiding shit.

2333
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,937
He's a weasel.
I-I'm onto him.

2334
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,471
This is why
I didn't want to leave,

2335
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,406
'cause now all your crazy's
focused on Mom.

2336
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,908
I'm not doing
anything crazy, okay?

2337
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,944
Doing nothing would be crazy.
I'm doing something, okay?

2338
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:22,245
I'm taking action!

2339
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,747
Leave Mom alone.
Stop acting like you.

2340
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,949
What's that mean?!

2341
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,583
You ruined my Halloween party.

2342
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,985
You know, you know what?
You know what?

2343
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:31,254
Go enjoy your party.
I-I got this.

2344
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:34,123
You don't got this.
Don't do anything.

2345
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:35,258
I got this.

2346
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,792
Don't do anything!

2347
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,445
Hey, Scott. What's up?

2348
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,814
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

2349
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:01,217
I, uh... I just came by
to say hi to the kids.

2350
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,351
Are-are they around?

2351
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:03,519
Oh.

2352
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:04,887
Well, they're not here.

2353
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:06,889
They went to their grandma's.

2354
01:22:07,023 --> 01:22:08,357
Oh.

2355
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:10,659
Well, what do you got
going on over there?

2356
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,661
I'm trying to open
this bottle of wine,

2357
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,663
but I think I mangled the cork.

2358
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:16,065
(grunts)

2359
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:17,900
Oh, well, I could help.
You want me to help?

2360
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:19,668
Yes. Yes.

2361
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:21,170
Please.

2362
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:24,540
-Yeah!
-Yes.

2363
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,043
So, uh, do you have a friend
coming over or something?

2364
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,245
Oh, no. (chuckles)

2365
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,880
No, I just need some mommy time.

2366
01:22:32,015 --> 01:22:35,884
Sometimes, mommies need to drink
when the kids are away.

2367
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:37,253
Oh, well, could I hang?

2368
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,222
I-I could use some mommy time.

2369
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:42,158
Sure, but are you
old enough to drink?

2370
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,826
Yeah, I'm old enough.
I just-- I'd rather smoke.

2371
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,228
Do you mind if I smoke in here?

2372
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:46,695
Oh, no. No.

2373
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,431
-(grunts)
-Let's crack some windows.

2374
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:50,899
-It's Tuesday.
-Really?

2375
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:52,935
'Cause Ray hates
when I smoke weed.

2376
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:55,338
Mm. Well, I hate Ray.

2377
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,040
Awesome.

2378
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:06,649
-Mm.
-You know...

2379
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:09,885
You have the sweetest,

2380
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:12,221
most adorable kids
I've ever met in my life.

2381
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:13,922
Like, I can't believe
they came out of Ray.

2382
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,758
I know.

2383
01:23:15,891 --> 01:23:17,060
And you know what?

2384
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,861
You know what
the thing is about Ray?

2385
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,098
I never say a bad word
about him in front of the kids,

2386
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:26,935
which is very difficult
because he's a cunt.

2387
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,437
Yeah, I-I can imagine.

2388
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:32,408
Well, I'm not one of your kids,
so have at it.

2389
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,943
Let it all out.
Tell me everything.

2390
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:37,280
Do you know he is fighting to

2391
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:40,483
actively not have custody
of his kids?

2392
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:41,884
-You can do that?
-Yeah.

2393
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,586
-That's insane.
-I know.

2394
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,088
Who wouldn't want
to hang with your kids?

2395
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,423
Who wouldn't want to hang out
with those kids?

2396
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:49,825
What monster wouldn't want
to hang out with those kids?

2397
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,294
Every second!

2398
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:52,561
Your daughter sang
the other day.

2399
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,097
What did she sing?

2400
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,099
Something from, like,
Oklahoma! or something,

2401
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:58,000
and-and I hate that shit,
and I fucking loved it.

2402
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,436
-(chuckles)
-She's such a little angel.

2403
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:02,805
-Mm. -I-I thought
she was a robot for, like,

2404
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:04,807
the first couple days
I was hanging out with her.

2405
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,609
I know. She's so perfect.

2406
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:08,244
What a fucking putz.

2407
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,678
Yeah, so he only
wants to see them

2408
01:24:09,812 --> 01:24:12,315
on Wednesday night for dinner
and Sunday.

2409
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:14,683
-(scoffs) You can't just
pick and choose. -And, uh...

2410
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:15,951
No, you can't.

2411
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:17,286
What are your kids,
the NFL package?

2412
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,088
-Wait, you're only-- Yeah.
-Yeah.

2413
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:20,989
But why would you want
your kids, really,

2414
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:25,861
if you don't have an apartment
and you sleep at the firehouse?

2415
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,863
-(scoffs, chuckles)
-I mean, you...

2416
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,198
Unbelievable. (chuckles)

2417
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:30,833
What kind of a grown man

2418
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:33,202
can't afford his own apartment
in Staten Island?

2419
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:34,837
Fucking loser.

2420
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,773
He lost all our money gambling.

2421
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:43,011
He is homeless, he's penniless,
and he's a deadbeat dad.

2422
01:24:43,146 --> 01:24:45,047
What is your mom doing with him?

2423
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:47,516
You know, my mom hasn't
gotten laid in 17 years,

2424
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,152
so I think her bar
is pretty low.

2425
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:52,020
Really? Yeah.

2426
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:54,022
He's good in bed,
I hate to say it.

2427
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:55,224
All right.

2428
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:57,493
Well, I didn't really
need to know that.

2429
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:58,527
Yeah.

2430
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:01,063
He's got a beautiful cock.

2431
01:25:01,197 --> 01:25:04,567
I mean, it's the--
it's his only attribute.

2432
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,802
That big thick cock
kept me in it

2433
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,472
for eight years longer
than I should have stayed.

2434
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,039
It's a fact.

2435
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:12,708
I knew I smelled you.

2436
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:14,310
-The fuck, Scott?
-SCOTT: What?

2437
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,212
Huh? What, are you
spying on me now?

2438
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:17,646
-You Magnum, P.I.?
-What?

2439
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,014
Telling your mom
that I'm homeless?

2440
01:25:19,148 --> 01:25:21,016
You think it's funny
to tell her that I'm a loser?

2441
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,585
What are you talking--
No. What?

2442
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:24,320
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

2443
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,189
You've been speak--
You talking to my ex-wife?

2444
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:27,923
Uh, yeah. She's actually
a really nice person.

2445
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,592
-Oh, is she?
Why don't you marry her? -Yeah.

2446
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,260
Why don't you marry her
and see what the fuck happens?

2447
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:33,061
Hey, I'm just trying to protect
my mom from you, okay?

2448
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:34,330
You're a fucking psychopath.

2449
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:35,564
-Oh, I'm a psychopath?
-Yeah.

2450
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:36,732
I've been nothing
but nice to you!

2451
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,167
I tried giving you direction.

2452
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:39,702
You're too busy
smoking your fucking weed.

2453
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,404
And all you've been doing
is trying to destroy

2454
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:42,771
everything that I have
with Margie.

2455
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:44,373
Because you're
a fucking loser, dude!

2456
01:25:44,507 --> 01:25:45,908
You're a, you're a
degenerate gambler

2457
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,076
in your-your mid-50s,
who bets on the Jets.

2458
01:25:48,211 --> 01:25:49,878
Uh, who-- Have you not learned
anything about betting?

2459
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:51,614
-The Jets are gonna come back!
-No, they're not!

2460
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,182
They got three
number one fucking picks!

2461
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:54,950
They're never gonna come back!
They're never gonna come back!

2462
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,585
I'm trying to give
your mother a good life!

2463
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,721
I-- No, you're not, okay?
You're a piece of shit, dude.

2464
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:00,756
You're a fucking drug addict!
I'm a piece of shit?

2465
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:02,625
Yeah, you're a piece of shit!
I'm a fucking loser?

2466
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,092
You're the biggest loser
I ever met in my fucking life!

2467
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:05,194
-Oh, really? You should know.
-Yeah! Yeah!

2468
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:06,395
You surround yourself with them.

2469
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:07,630
-Oh, yeah? Why don't you
try me? -Oh, really?

2470
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:08,964
Why don't you try me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

2471
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,333
This ain't gonna go
how you think it's gonna go.

2472
01:26:10,466 --> 01:26:11,900
So why don't you get the fuck
out of my-- Really?

2473
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,206
-Fucking asshole.
-Throw a fucking punch at me?

2474
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,407
-Oh, yeah.
-Huh? You gonna cool off?

2475
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:19,775
-Come here, cocksucker.
-You gonna cool off?

2476
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:21,076
-I'll fucking cool you off.
-(grunts)

2477
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,212
-Yeah, I'll fucking
cool you off! -(both yell)

2478
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:28,884
Hey, you cool off now?

2479
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,553
You're in there
'cause of your own actions!

2480
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:31,820
Are you kidding me?!

2481
01:26:31,954 --> 01:26:33,656
I'm gonna tell my mom
you tried to drown me.

2482
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:34,757
In an aboveground pool?

2483
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,091
You're, like,
fucking eight feet tall.

2484
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:37,960
You're lucky my dad isn't here.
He would kick your ass.

2485
01:26:38,093 --> 01:26:40,563
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what,
I knew your dad. Okay?

2486
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,831
-Yeah? -Yeah, I crossed paths
with him a number of times.

2487
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:46,269
And you know what? He was even
a bigger asshole than you are!

2488
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:48,771
All right, that's it, that's it.

2489
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:50,072
It's over. It's over.

2490
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,474
(grunts) Huh? Huh?

2491
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:53,141
-You like that? You like that?
-Ow.

2492
01:26:53,276 --> 01:26:55,077
(both grunting)

2493
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,583
(muttering)

2494
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:03,352
-Jesus.
-Fucking asshole.

2495
01:27:03,486 --> 01:27:05,521
-Come on, tap out! Tap out!
-(grunting)

2496
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:07,155
-Fuck you! No!
-Get me out! Let me out!

2497
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,324
-No! No!
-Let me out!

2498
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:09,625
-MARGIE: Oh, my God!
-Get me out!

2499
01:27:09,758 --> 01:27:11,927
What's the matter with you?!

2500
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,262
He's a psycho.

2501
01:27:13,396 --> 01:27:14,597
RAY:
No.

2502
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,499
-We're just talking.
-About what?

2503
01:27:16,632 --> 01:27:18,667
-About him telling you lies
about me. -He's an animal.

2504
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:20,102
He picked me up
and he threw me in the pool.

2505
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,505
-All right? He has to go.
-No, I need you to go. Now.

2506
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:24,273
What? Why-why me?
He-he's the one who started it.

2507
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:25,708
Yeah, that's right.
Get the hell out of here.

2508
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:27,543
And get a job and a life
while you're at it.

2509
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:28,777
Your freeloading days are over.

2510
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:29,845
You, too. Get going.

2511
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:32,014
Wait, what did I do?

2512
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:34,483
You put your hands on my son!

2513
01:27:34,617 --> 01:27:35,684
You're not respecting my family!

2514
01:27:35,818 --> 01:27:36,685
You're an animal!

2515
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:38,186
Look, okay, just listen.

2516
01:27:38,321 --> 01:27:40,188
-Just calm down.
-I don't have to calm down!

2517
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:41,624
What are--
You're attacking my son!

2518
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,392
And you're, and you're
making up lies!

2519
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,227
You made-- You tricked me into
thinking you're a good guy.

2520
01:27:45,361 --> 01:27:46,429
You're not a good guy.

2521
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:47,896
-Right. Mm-hmm.
-You're a fucking small guy.

2522
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:49,898
Margie, Margie, just let me
explain this to you.

2523
01:27:50,032 --> 01:27:52,034
-Just let me talk to you, okay?
-You are not in control of me.

2524
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,402
Okay, okay, listen, all right?

2525
01:27:53,536 --> 01:27:54,903
Okay, you don't have
all the information you need.

2526
01:27:55,037 --> 01:27:56,204
All right? Scott is acting out

2527
01:27:56,339 --> 01:27:57,873
'cause he's afraid
to move on with his life.

2528
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:59,408
It's no different than
when the Boston Red Sox

2529
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:00,709
finally won
a World Series, okay?

2530
01:28:00,843 --> 01:28:02,144
-Oh, my God. -They had,
they had to get to a point

2531
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,346
-where-where they believed,
okay? -Just shut up.

2532
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:04,780
-All-all...
-Shut the fuck up.

2533
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:07,015
All I did was just ask him
a question, and he flipped out.

2534
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:08,551
So I put him in the water,
which is soft.

2535
01:28:08,684 --> 01:28:09,718
I diffused the situation.

2536
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:11,153
It was what-what
m-my training's all about.

2537
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,488
I-I wa-- I was totally
diffusing the situation.

2538
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,522
Do you ever shut up?

2539
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:14,723
Do you ever just
shut the fuck up?

2540
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:16,325
You just talk and you talk
and you talk,

2541
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:17,560
and you don't know
what you're saying.

2542
01:28:17,693 --> 01:28:18,994
It makes no sense.

2543
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,929
It's like you picked up
all these little pieces

2544
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:22,931
of information from all over.

2545
01:28:23,065 --> 01:28:24,867
They don't make any sense.
They're fragments.

2546
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,869
No sense. Nonsense.

2547
01:28:31,006 --> 01:28:32,408
I-I'm not talking.

2548
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,444
I've had it up to here.
I'm done.

2549
01:28:35,578 --> 01:28:38,013
Both of you,
get your shit out of here.

2550
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:43,819
Margie.

2551
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:46,455
(sighs):
Oh, fuck.

2552
01:28:46,589 --> 01:28:47,456
Well... (sighs)

2553
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,792
Well, where do we go now?

2554
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:52,194
What are you asking me for?

2555
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:55,330
You created this whole mess,
you fucking schmuck.

2556
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:03,506
(grunting)

2557
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:26,895
(phone buzzes)

2558
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,599
Hey, man.

2559
01:29:32,435 --> 01:29:34,002
(sighs)

2560
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:35,438
Are you mad at me?

2561
01:29:35,571 --> 01:29:37,239
Me? No, of course not.

2562
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,941
Are-are you mad at me?

2563
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:40,142
I mean,

2564
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:41,309
-no, but...
-Are they--

2565
01:29:41,444 --> 01:29:43,111
Are they asking questions
about me?

2566
01:29:43,245 --> 01:29:45,080
I'm not gonna snitch
on you, man.

2567
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,416
But at the same time, like,
what am I gonna say to them?

2568
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,885
You were the lookout
that didn't look out.

2569
01:29:51,286 --> 01:29:53,789
Um, well, I've been
meaning to ask you.

2570
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:58,861
Um... you know, since you're in
here, uh, well, I was wondering

2571
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:02,197
if you wouldn't mind me staying
at your house for a little bit.

2572
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,033
You came up here to ask me that?

2573
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,401
-I also came to see you.
-You came--

2574
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:07,936
No, you didn't come to see me.
You came to ask me that.

2575
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,071
And, no, you can't stay
at my house.

2576
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:10,372
I'm sor-- I have
nowhere to go, bro.

2577
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:11,840
-My house is frightening, dude.
-My mom kicked, my mom

2578
01:30:11,974 --> 01:30:13,341
-kicked me out. -The fuck
are you doing with your life?

2579
01:30:13,476 --> 01:30:14,977
Drive all the way down here
just to ask me

2580
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,211
if you can stay at my house.

2581
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:17,613
-No, I-I...
-No, you don't love me.

2582
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:18,647
I do love you.

2583
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:19,815
I'm sorry.
I-I-- You're right.

2584
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:21,116
I shouldn't have asked.
I'm sorry.

2585
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,118
And you know what?
I need you to do me a favor.

2586
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,487
Anything, bro. Just ask.

2587
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:27,556
You got to feed my cat,
all right?

2588
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,625
For the next
three to five months.

2589
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,026
Is there anything else
I could do?

2590
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,695
'Cause I'm-I'm kind of
allergic to cats.

2591
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,331
You better look out
for Sprinkles,

2592
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:39,001
because I'm looking out
for you, all right?

2593
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,135
You got it.

2594
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,970
And, listen, man.

2595
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:44,006
I need you to spend time
with Sprinkles.

2596
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:45,908
I don't want you just

2597
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:47,910
going in there,
feeding him and running out.

2598
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:49,411
You got to go in there,
scratch his belly.

2599
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:53,381
You tell him I miss him
and I'll see him soon.

2600
01:30:53,516 --> 01:30:54,750
Right.

2601
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:57,152
Um, how, uh, how are the boys?

2602
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:58,721
How's Igor and Richie
doing in there?

2603
01:30:58,854 --> 01:31:01,323
I'll tell you right now.
I haven't seen Richie.

2604
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,324
Igor?

2605
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,092
Bro, look to your right.

2606
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:05,160
That's Carla.

2607
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:06,361
Carla.

2608
01:31:06,495 --> 01:31:08,396
SCOTT (whispering):
Holy shit! Get the--

2609
01:31:08,531 --> 01:31:09,932
Bro, she's fucking real.

2610
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:11,066
She's fucking real.

2611
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,100
She's fucking real.
Holy shit.

2612
01:31:12,234 --> 01:31:15,237
Yo. She's hot, man.

2613
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,375
SCOTT: He was telling the truth
the entire time.

2614
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:22,778
-Good for him, man.
-I know.

2615
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:25,013
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

2616
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:28,016
-(crickets chirping)
-(snoring)

2617
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:31,554
(door opens, closes)

2618
01:31:32,755 --> 01:31:33,956
MAN:
Hey, you.

2619
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:35,423
What the hell
are you doing there?

2620
01:31:35,558 --> 01:31:37,459
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was my house.

2621
01:31:37,593 --> 01:31:40,529
Get out of my backyard!

2622
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:42,531
Get the hell out of here!

2623
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,541
I'm really glad we did that.

2624
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:54,276
It was really nice.

2625
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:55,578
-Me, too.
-(chuckles)

2626
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:57,379
That was awesome.

2627
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,481
Yeah. I missed you.

2628
01:31:59,615 --> 01:32:01,383
-Oh, yeah? I missed you, too.
-(chuckles)

2629
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:02,718
Just like, uh, old times.

2630
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,252
I miss all my friends, you know.

2631
01:32:04,386 --> 01:32:07,790
-(chuckles)
-Mr. Shark, Mr. Weird Skeleton.

2632
01:32:07,923 --> 01:32:09,625
-Well, they missed you, too.
-(laughs)

2633
01:32:09,758 --> 01:32:11,426
They missed you, too.

2634
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:15,964
Hey, I, uh...
I'm in a bit of a situation.

2635
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:18,667
You think I could stay here
for a few days?

2636
01:32:18,801 --> 01:32:20,669
What are you talking about?

2637
01:32:20,803 --> 01:32:21,937
Well, it's silly.

2638
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:23,471
Me and Ray got into
this big fight,

2639
01:32:23,606 --> 01:32:26,642
and then my mom caught us, and
she just started yelling at us.

2640
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:29,612
And she threw us out, so--
She kind of lost her mind.

2641
01:32:31,413 --> 01:32:33,248
Is that why you're here
right now?

2642
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,250
No.

2643
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,653
Did you just fuck me
for shelter?

2644
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,154
No, I didn't fuck you
for shelter.

2645
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,856
Uh, I-I-I didn't do anything.

2646
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:43,659
What? I didn't-- I just--
I just need a place to stay.

2647
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:45,661
(sighs):
Oh, God.

2648
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:49,031
Dude, dude, how many times
we got to do this?

2649
01:32:49,164 --> 01:32:50,432
What do you mean?
I-I just want to...

2650
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,000
(sighs) I just need--
It's just for a couple weeks.

2651
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:53,168
It's not that big of a deal.

2652
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:55,871
A few weeks?
You just said a few days.

2653
01:32:56,004 --> 01:32:57,372
-Uh, or a couple months. It's...
-Months?

2654
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:59,107
(stammers)
I'm figuring my stuff out.

2655
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:00,308
I don't know the future.

2656
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:02,978
Oh, my God, you...

2657
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:04,713
There you go.

2658
01:33:04,847 --> 01:33:07,816
-What the-- Hey.
-I'm not going to let myself

2659
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:09,785
be upset by you, but
I'm gonna tell you something.

2660
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,887
You make me feel so crazy.

2661
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,789
I'm not gonna let myself
be crazy now,

2662
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,557
but you make me feel crazy!

2663
01:33:15,691 --> 01:33:17,025
You are so crazy that you make

2664
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:19,527
everyone around you
feel fucking crazy.

2665
01:33:19,662 --> 01:33:21,529
The people meet you,
and they're normal people,

2666
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:23,531
and then they hang out with you,
and then they're fucking

2667
01:33:23,666 --> 01:33:24,833
Jack Nicholson in The Shining
or something.

2668
01:33:24,967 --> 01:33:27,135
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2669
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:30,038
I got to stay Zen.
I got to meditate.

2670
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:32,975
I'm meditating right now,
and you got to go.

2671
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:35,010
-What? What?
-Yeah, here's your shit.

2672
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:36,078
Okay.

2673
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:37,512
Staying calm.

2674
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:39,314
You got to leave.
It's time to go.

2675
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:40,716
Well...

2676
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:41,850
Get out.

2677
01:33:41,984 --> 01:33:43,551
Well, I don't have
anywhere to go.

2678
01:33:43,686 --> 01:33:45,888
It's not my problem anymore.

2679
01:33:46,021 --> 01:33:47,890
Thank you for the sex.

2680
01:33:48,023 --> 01:33:51,159
It was wonderful
until you started talking.

2681
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:52,427
You got to go.

2682
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,596
Could I sleep
in your brother's room?

2683
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:55,731
No.

2684
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:57,532
But he has bunk beds.

2685
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:59,367
He's 14 years old.

2686
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:01,503
(TV playing quietly)

2687
01:34:03,538 --> 01:34:05,573
Hey, yo, Dougie,
can I crash in your room?

2688
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:07,209
That's not happening, bro.

2689
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:09,177
(sighs):
Jesus Christ.

2690
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:20,756
(sighs):
Fuck.

2691
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,959
Hey, do you know
where Ray Bishop is?

2692
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:59,895
He's in the back.
Come with me.

2693
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,897
How about next time
you put your mask on

2694
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,265
before we get off the rig?

2695
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:05,167
I mean, I'm standing at
that front door for a minute

2696
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,668
-waiting for you. What the hell?
-I told him to.

2697
01:35:06,802 --> 01:35:07,803
Always with
the backhanded compliment.

2698
01:35:07,936 --> 01:35:09,071
Why can't you just, you know,

2699
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,672
at least say
the nice thing and then...

2700
01:35:10,806 --> 01:35:12,574
-Listen, you should be happy
with any compliment. -Okay.

2701
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,742
-It's constructive criticism.
-It's...

2702
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:14,943
-It just-- It's always bad.
-Go ahead.

2703
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:16,745
I would respond better
to encouragement.

2704
01:35:16,879 --> 01:35:17,980
I'm just...

2705
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:19,647
I encourage you
to shut the fuck up.

2706
01:35:19,782 --> 01:35:20,648
(laughter)

2707
01:35:20,783 --> 01:35:21,850
He's soft. He can't take it.

2708
01:35:21,984 --> 01:35:23,318
-You're right.
-He's an emotional eater.

2709
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,187
RAY: Well, that's the problem
with this generation, man.

2710
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,388
They can't take criticism.

2711
01:35:26,521 --> 01:35:27,990
-They get, they get
all-all upset. -I know.

2712
01:35:28,123 --> 01:35:30,092
SAVAGE: Hey, I'm not
a whole generation, all right?

2713
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:32,094
I'm just, I'm just a man.
A man with feelings.

2714
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,628
-Oh, my God.
-Aw! -Aw!

2715
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:35,430
-Now you're making me look bad.
-(lively chatter)

2716
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,265
-You're a man? -Now you're
making me look bad. Stop.

2717
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,667
(laughter, chatter continues)

2718
01:35:39,802 --> 01:35:41,103
Ray.

2719
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:42,104
Hey, Ray.

2720
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,039
(chatter stops)

2721
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:45,974
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2722
01:35:46,108 --> 01:35:48,210
What are you doing here?

2723
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:50,645
Look, uh, I-I don't have
anywhere else to go, all right?

2724
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:52,347
I'm out of options, so...

2725
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,715
Why would I care?

2726
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:55,283
I'm sorry. Like, uh-uh...

2727
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:57,285
Go sleep under a tree.
I don't care.

2728
01:35:57,419 --> 01:36:00,688
Do you have any idea
what you took from me? Do you?

2729
01:36:00,823 --> 01:36:03,625
Huh? You do a 60-minute
interview with my ex-wife

2730
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,460
to find out
what kind of guy I am?

2731
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,029
What do you think
she was gonna say?

2732
01:36:07,162 --> 01:36:08,964
-I don't know. I...
-By the way,

2733
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,833
I'm not a gambler, okay?
I day-trade.

2734
01:36:10,966 --> 01:36:12,400
I don't know the difference.

2735
01:36:12,534 --> 01:36:14,469
You should've found out
before you shot your mouth off.

2736
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:16,204
I know you smoke a lot of weed,
but you're not dumb.

2737
01:36:16,338 --> 01:36:17,472
You knew what the fuck
you were doing.

2738
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,541
You went to the person
that hates me the most

2739
01:36:19,674 --> 01:36:21,143
to get the worst review
you could possibly get.

2740
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:22,710
Why didn't you come down here
and ask these guys

2741
01:36:22,845 --> 01:36:23,778
what they thought of me?

2742
01:36:23,912 --> 01:36:25,713
Did you ever think
of doing that?

2743
01:36:25,848 --> 01:36:27,916
(sighs) I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

2744
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:29,417
-Uh, I shouldn't have done...
-You're not sorry

2745
01:36:29,551 --> 01:36:30,652
or you wouldn't have done it.
So now what?

2746
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,087
Now you don't have
a place to stay?

2747
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,889
So now you come down here
with your little puppy dog look

2748
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:35,723
on your face,
and I'm supposed to feel bad?

2749
01:36:35,858 --> 01:36:37,259
Look, all I know is,

2750
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:39,727
if you're not nice to me, then
my mom will hate you forever

2751
01:36:39,862 --> 01:36:41,496
and she'll never forgive you.

2752
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:42,998
Really?
You're gonna play that card?

2753
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:46,001
It's a, it's a pretty good card.

2754
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,170
It's all I got.

2755
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:49,938
(crickets chirping)

2756
01:36:50,072 --> 01:36:52,074
(men snoring)

2757
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:02,750
(sighs)

2758
01:37:02,885 --> 01:37:04,853
(whispering):
Ray.

2759
01:37:04,987 --> 01:37:07,122
Hey, Ray.

2760
01:37:07,255 --> 01:37:09,024
(singsongy):
Raymond.

2761
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,558
(whispering):
Ray!

2762
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:13,528
What?

2763
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:14,629
Hey, I can't sleep.

2764
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:16,098
I-I never go to sleep
this early.

2765
01:37:16,231 --> 01:37:18,733
Oh. Well, you know
what you should do?

2766
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:20,402
You should shut the fuck up.

2767
01:37:20,535 --> 01:37:22,237
Go to sleep.

2768
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:23,638
Thanks.

2769
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:25,073
Can't go to sleep.

2770
01:37:25,207 --> 01:37:27,075
Why don't you
dip your weed in NyQuil,

2771
01:37:27,209 --> 01:37:29,011
you fucking drug addict?

2772
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:33,015
(alarm ringing
and blaring loudly)

2773
01:37:40,088 --> 01:37:41,789
Hey, w-what do I do?

2774
01:37:41,924 --> 01:37:44,392
Do what you always do.
Sit there and do nothing.

2775
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,270
(truck engine starts)

2776
01:37:55,403 --> 01:37:57,405
(truck doors closing)

2777
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,742
(birds chirping)

2778
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:04,212
(yawns, coughs)

2779
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:17,525
Hey. Where do you go
to the bathroom around here?

2780
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:19,161
Well, number one, down there.

2781
01:38:19,294 --> 01:38:20,996
Number two, Dunkin' Donuts
across the street.

2782
01:38:22,965 --> 01:38:24,466
Have a wonderful day, man.

2783
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:26,001
Oh, thanks.

2784
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,105
(sighs)

2785
01:38:31,806 --> 01:38:32,874
(shower curtain opens)

2786
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:34,809
GARDNER:
How'd you sleep, big man?

2787
01:38:36,444 --> 01:38:37,845
I hear you're Stan's kid.

2788
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:39,948
He was a brave man.
It's an honor to meet you.

2789
01:38:40,082 --> 01:38:41,149
Thanks, man.

2790
01:38:41,283 --> 01:38:42,684
It's a, it's an honor
to meet you, too.

2791
01:38:42,817 --> 01:38:44,219
I-I didn't do anything, though.

2792
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,820
You don't think you did?

2793
01:38:45,954 --> 01:38:46,955
No.

2794
01:38:47,089 --> 01:38:49,691
I appreciate your sacrifice.

2795
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,295
No, I got this one
to impress a girl.

2796
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:55,297
Oh? And how did that work out?

2797
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:56,798
Not good.

2798
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,566
-We've been married 18 years.
-PAPA: Ooh, poor woman.

2799
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,635
-18 years, huh?
-Congratulations.

2800
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:01,836
-Thank you.
-Wow.

2801
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:04,672
The rest I got, you know,
Maori, tribal.

2802
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:05,873
SCOTT:
It's beautiful work, man.

2803
01:39:06,008 --> 01:39:06,874
Thank you, man.
I appreciate that.

2804
01:39:07,009 --> 01:39:07,976
-What was that one?
-Maori.

2805
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,477
This stands for
strength and courage.

2806
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:10,512
-LOCKWOOD: Really?
Yeah.

2807
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:12,314
(door opens)

2808
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,816
What the hell are you
still doing here?

2809
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,551
Well, you know,
believe it or not,

2810
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:19,487
I-I couldn't find a place
to live in just a night, so...

2811
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,889
-I believe it.
-I'm kind of fucked, Ray.

2812
01:39:22,024 --> 01:39:23,058
RAY:
Yes, you are.

2813
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:24,426
I'd say finish up
your free breakfast,

2814
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:26,428
and, uh, hit the bricks.

2815
01:39:26,561 --> 01:39:27,862
All right. It's all right.

2816
01:39:27,996 --> 01:39:30,032
The kid can stay.

2817
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:32,734
But you got to work, all right?
You ready to do some work?

2818
01:39:32,867 --> 01:39:36,171
Yeah. Did... did you just,
did you just make me a fireman?

2819
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:37,739
(Rivera laughs)

2820
01:39:37,872 --> 01:39:38,940
No.

2821
01:39:39,074 --> 01:39:40,908
Go clean the toilets
or get the fuck out.

2822
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:43,345
Did I make you a-- What...

2823
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:44,746
RIVERA:
Hey, do me a favor.

2824
01:39:44,879 --> 01:39:47,049
The bathroom downstairs--
I-I used it.

2825
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:48,583
You can start there.

2826
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:50,218
(whispers):
Great.

2827
01:39:50,352 --> 01:39:52,220
Get gloves. Pretty muddy.

2828
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:54,022
You know, when I see
a big stain like that,

2829
01:39:54,156 --> 01:39:56,724
I go up and down,
and then I go left and right.

2830
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:58,560
-Good times.
-There you go.

2831
01:39:58,693 --> 01:40:00,395
You got to get the splatter.

2832
01:40:02,364 --> 01:40:04,632
PALAZZO: You see that?
That's a nice straight line.

2833
01:40:04,766 --> 01:40:08,070
Yeah, you guys, uh, got to do
a lot of shit work, huh?

2834
01:40:08,203 --> 01:40:09,937
We don't refer to it
as shit work.

2835
01:40:10,072 --> 01:40:12,107
This is our house.
We want it to look nice.

2836
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,941
You know, company pride.

2837
01:40:14,076 --> 01:40:15,443
You got to wash it hot.

2838
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:17,979
Hot. Not warm, not cold.
Extra hot.

2839
01:40:18,113 --> 01:40:19,647
-Okay.
-Because of the bedbugs.

2840
01:40:19,781 --> 01:40:20,882
What-What's bedbugs?

2841
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,750
They're, uh, a-a tiny insect

2842
01:40:22,884 --> 01:40:25,387
that get into your home
and they run you out.

2843
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:34,929
(Scott groans)

2844
01:40:35,063 --> 01:40:37,031
(laughter)

2845
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,971
-You know how they procreate?
-No.

2846
01:40:44,106 --> 01:40:46,108
The male bedbug takes his penis

2847
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:47,975
and jams it into
the female's stomach.

2848
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:50,612
Does the female have a vagina?
Yeah, she does.

2849
01:40:50,745 --> 01:40:51,746
It doesn't matter.

2850
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,815
He jams it into her stomach.

2851
01:40:53,948 --> 01:40:55,750
Well, how do you know
all this, man?

2852
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,552
How do I know?
I researched it.

2853
01:40:59,954 --> 01:41:01,756
-Just flip it over. Flip.
-Oh, just a flip.

2854
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:02,990
-There you go, yeah.
-Okay.

2855
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:04,459
You got it.
Just flip it right down.

2856
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:06,661
-Very nice.
-Mm.

2857
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:09,864
Well done.

2858
01:41:09,997 --> 01:41:12,467
When you have bedbugs,
everybody leaves.

2859
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:13,701
My parents stopped calling.

2860
01:41:13,835 --> 01:41:15,437
My brothers and sisters
stopped coming over.

2861
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,539
My girl left.
Everybody's gone.

2862
01:41:17,672 --> 01:41:19,774
And you know who's there
for you at the end?

2863
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:20,775
Ironically?

2864
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,009
The bedbugs.

2865
01:41:22,144 --> 01:41:24,112
PALAZZO:
I never thought I'd say it,

2866
01:41:24,246 --> 01:41:25,713
but if I make chief,
I'm making you my aide.

2867
01:41:25,847 --> 01:41:27,349
-PAPA: Yeah?
-What's up, kid?

2868
01:41:27,482 --> 01:41:29,451
PAPA: Well, how do you think
you did on the test?

2869
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:30,585
PALAZZO:
Tough test.

2870
01:41:30,718 --> 01:41:32,019
I mean, you know,
I hope I did good.

2871
01:41:32,154 --> 01:41:33,188
Fuck!

2872
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,796
-He's doing a good job.
-(scoffs)

2873
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,565
He knows how to wash a truck.

2874
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:46,301
Getting ready for his career
working at a car wash.

2875
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:48,803
You ever gonna give this kid
a break or what?

2876
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:51,005
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

2877
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,875
Then do nothing.

2878
01:41:55,877 --> 01:41:58,180
Were you on the job
when Stan was killed?

2879
01:41:58,313 --> 01:42:00,582
Yeah. You know I was.

2880
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:03,885
What's the first thing
you thought of when you heard?

2881
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:09,891
I-I wondered if he had kids.

2882
01:42:20,735 --> 01:42:22,604
Why do we have to clean
this thing anyway?

2883
01:42:22,737 --> 01:42:24,739
It's just gonna get fire on it.

2884
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:26,741
You think the people
that are burning alive

2885
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:28,776
give a fuck
if the truck is shiny?

2886
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:30,144
Just saying.

2887
01:42:30,278 --> 01:42:32,013
I don't even know why
you got to clean the truck.

2888
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:35,016
What, you're trying to show up
all sexy to a fire?

2889
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,319
I like him.

2890
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:42,390
(shouting)

2891
01:42:42,524 --> 01:42:44,158
(laughter)

2892
01:42:49,431 --> 01:42:50,732
No! No! Stop!

2893
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:52,534
All right!

2894
01:42:55,203 --> 01:42:57,205
Let me fix that backpack.
It's slipping.

2895
01:42:59,907 --> 01:43:02,076
It's weird having you
walk me to school.

2896
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:03,478
Why is that?

2897
01:43:03,611 --> 01:43:06,414
'Cause Scott always walks me.

2898
01:43:06,548 --> 01:43:08,883
I walk you sometimes.

2899
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,618
I guess so.

2900
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:15,156
Is he, uh, is he weird
around you guys?

2901
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:16,458
No.

2902
01:43:16,591 --> 01:43:18,260
He's nice.

2903
01:43:18,393 --> 01:43:20,795
He asks me how I'm doing.

2904
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:23,097
What do you tell him?

2905
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:25,733
I say I'm doing fine.

2906
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:28,470
Look, you don't have to lie to
make me feel better, all right?

2907
01:43:28,603 --> 01:43:30,772
I know me and your mom
could do a better job

2908
01:43:30,905 --> 01:43:33,408
getting along through
all of this, and, uh...

2909
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:36,143
Hey, I'm sorry if I haven't
handled it so well.

2910
01:43:38,446 --> 01:43:40,515
What's that?

2911
01:43:40,648 --> 01:43:42,584
Oh, that's Ice Flash.

2912
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,787
Scott drew it for me,
but it didn't come out so good.

2913
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,490
Yeah, I think his drawings
are a little shaky.

2914
01:43:48,623 --> 01:43:50,258
That's the one that I drew.

2915
01:43:53,428 --> 01:43:54,929
This is how he drew it.

2916
01:43:59,934 --> 01:44:01,202
It's good, right?

2917
01:44:01,336 --> 01:44:03,638
Yeah, it's better than good.

2918
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:05,707
Did a great job.

2919
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,974
Yeah.

2920
01:44:07,108 --> 01:44:08,776
He said he was gonna teach me.

2921
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,145
RAY: He said he'd teach you
how to do that?

2922
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:12,580
Yeah.

2923
01:44:13,615 --> 01:44:15,617
And he stays to his word.

2929
01:44:29,831 --> 01:44:31,198
-Oh, hey, Scott.
-What's...

2930
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:32,400
What's going on in here?

2931
01:44:32,534 --> 01:44:33,668
Where-- Why is everything
so different?

2932
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:35,470
JOY:
Isn't it nice? Do you like it?

2933
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,905
Is that a pink chair?

2934
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:40,342
-Yeah, we've been redecorating.
-W-What's up with the drapes?

2935
01:44:40,475 --> 01:44:41,476

Yeah. Why's...

2938
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:46,147
Your mother has great taste.

2939
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,382
Yeah.

2940
01:44:47,515 --> 01:44:48,916
MARGIE:
Where have you been staying?

2941
01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:51,085
Oh, I've been, uh,
at the firehouse with Ray.

2942
01:44:51,218 --> 01:44:53,821
Oh, okay. Well, I'm just glad
that you're not on the street.

2943
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:56,524
JOY:
I told you he wasn't homeless.

2944
01:44:56,658 --> 01:44:58,493
When you're right, you're ri--
I love this green.

2945
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:00,161
-MARGIE: Yeah, well...
-We-- I actually have been

2946
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:03,431
learning, uh, a lot and, like,
bonding with the guys.

2947
01:45:03,565 --> 01:45:04,699
-Oh.
-So, uh, yeah.

2948
01:45:04,832 --> 01:45:06,167
Yeah, they got me cleaning.

2949
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,436
Uh, they got me, like,
washing stuff and, like,

2950
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,738
-working around the firehouse
and... -Mm-hmm. Oh.

2951
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:12,540
I really understand where
you were coming from before.

2952
01:45:12,674 --> 01:45:14,108
You know, when you threw me out.

2953
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:16,544
Like, I think I really
got my shit together now,

2954
01:45:16,678 --> 01:45:18,613
and I'm ready to, like,
come back and...

2955
01:45:18,746 --> 01:45:20,214
(laughing):
Okay.

2956
01:45:20,348 --> 01:45:23,618
So, like, you think
you know what hard work is?

2957
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:25,620
Well, I wouldn't say that,
but, you-you know,

2958
01:45:25,753 --> 01:45:27,288
I-I-I definitely have an idea.

2959
01:45:27,422 --> 01:45:29,791
-(Joy laughing)
-You mopped a floor

2960
01:45:29,924 --> 01:45:31,426
and-and you cooked.

2961
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:33,595
You cleaned a bathroom once.

2962
01:45:33,728 --> 01:45:35,296
Oh. Oh, Scott.

2963
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:37,732
And how's your shoulder feel
after all that very hard work?

2964
01:45:37,865 --> 01:45:38,733
(Margie and Joy laughing)

2965
01:45:38,866 --> 01:45:40,034
Oh, you're making fun of me.

2966
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,102
Why are you making fun--

2967
01:45:41,235 --> 01:45:42,470
I-I worked really hard. I did.

2968
01:45:42,604 --> 01:45:43,471
Ask Ray.

2969
01:45:43,605 --> 01:45:44,939
He's trying to get back.

2970
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:46,140
(laughing)

2971
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:47,274
Eat a dick, Joy.

2972
01:45:47,409 --> 01:45:48,943
Had one for breakfast.

2973
01:45:49,076 --> 01:45:49,944
I'm full.

2974
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:51,413
Hey!

2975
01:45:51,546 --> 01:45:53,581
And-and wh--
and where's Dad's shrine?

2976
01:45:53,715 --> 01:45:54,916
-Where-where-where...
-Oh, you're ruining the vibe.

2977
01:45:55,049 --> 01:45:56,283
Where's his shrine?
Where's Dad's shrine?

2978
01:45:56,418 --> 01:45:58,486
All of his stuff is gone.
All my shit's gone.

2979
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,087
-What's going on?
-Honey.

2980
01:46:00,221 --> 01:46:01,489
Uh, all right, let--
I'm-I'm really sorry.

2981
01:46:01,623 --> 01:46:02,824
I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I'm sorry.

2982
01:46:02,957 --> 01:46:04,125
-I'm sorry I laughed.
-Could we talk in private?

2983
01:46:04,258 --> 01:46:05,226
-Let's go outside, yeah.
-Yeah.

2984

2987
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:12,099
-Let's just talk outside.

01:48:55,129 --> 01:48:56,964
you know, everybody gets
a little scared.

3053
01:48:57,098 --> 01:48:58,733
I mean, you know, I mean,
it's-- keeps you honest.

3054
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,267
You know?
No, if you don't get scared,

3055
01:49:00,401 --> 01:49:01,936
-there's something wrong
with you. -LOCKWOOD: Mm-hmm.

3056
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:03,337
("The Weight"
by The Band playing)

3057
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:06,574
And, by the way,
your dad never got scared.

3058
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:08,175
(laughter)

3059
01:49:08,309 --> 01:49:09,944
Yeah? How-how do you know?

3060
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:14,481
I mean, back in the day,
I-I was at the same house

3061
01:49:14,616 --> 01:49:16,684
with him for about
six months, so...

3062
01:49:16,818 --> 01:49:18,620
Wait, you worked with my dad
for six months

3063
01:49:18,753 --> 01:49:20,487
-and you're just telling me?
-Yeah. I mean, I--

3064
01:49:20,622 --> 01:49:22,156
Yeah, I didn't want
to make you feel weird.

3065
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:23,457
LOCKWOOD:
We didn't want to insult you

3066
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:25,459
'cause you seem
a little delicate.

3067
01:49:25,593 --> 01:49:26,594
-No. Please.
-PAPA: Well, yeah.

3068
01:49:26,728 --> 01:49:28,162
What, w-what was he like?

3069
01:49:28,295 --> 01:49:30,331
He was kind of like you.

3070
01:49:30,464 --> 01:49:32,166
You know, like,
if you didn't know him,

3071
01:49:32,299 --> 01:49:34,001
you'd think he was
a crack baby, but he was...

3072
01:49:34,135 --> 01:49:35,469
(laughter)

3073
01:49:35,603 --> 01:49:37,304
No, but he was a good guy.
He was a, he was a great guy.

3074
01:49:37,438 --> 01:49:39,306
-He was a great guy.
-Well, I-I, I mean, I heard

3075
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,541
-he was fucking hilarious.
-Oh, yeah.

3076
01:49:40,675 --> 01:49:42,176
And-and he got away
with so much shit,

3077
01:49:42,309 --> 01:49:43,945
like, because he was
so freaking likable.

3078
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,113
What kind of stuff?
Like, w-what'd he get away with?

3079
01:49:46,247 --> 01:49:48,382
One time, we were driving
down the West Side Highway

3080
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:50,317
-after being out all night...
-LOCKWOOD: Mm.

3081
01:49:50,451 --> 01:49:51,318
You know this.

3082
01:49:51,452 --> 01:49:52,954
This is a good one.

3083
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:54,288
And, uh, he's, like,

3084
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:56,023
he's up on the--
through the sunroof.

3085
01:49:56,157 --> 01:49:57,659
He's, like, sitting
on top of the car.

3086
01:49:57,792 --> 01:49:59,393
We're like--
We couldn't get him in.

3087
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:01,996
So we start speeding up,
stopping short, you know.

3088
01:50:02,129 --> 01:50:03,497
(laughs)

3089
01:50:03,631 --> 01:50:08,002
By the time we hit the bridge,
he fell onto the windshield.

3090
01:50:08,135 --> 01:50:09,370
-(laughing): So he's...
-What?

3091
01:50:09,503 --> 01:50:10,504
he's, like...

3092
01:50:10,638 --> 01:50:11,739
-(laughter)
-SCOTT: What?

3093
01:50:11,873 --> 01:50:14,341
Hanging on, cursing at us,
putting his face

3094
01:50:14,475 --> 01:50:15,409
up against the windshield.

3095
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:17,879
He's like, "You motherfuckers!"

3096
01:50:18,012 --> 01:50:20,314
-It was like some real
Tom Cruise shit. -(laughter)

3097
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:21,983
So... (laughs)

3098
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:23,918
(laughter)

3099
01:50:24,051 --> 01:50:25,653
We get into Brooklyn.

3100
01:50:25,787 --> 01:50:27,554
And sure-sure enough,
there's cops.

3101
01:50:27,689 --> 01:50:29,523
Like, uh, like they were
waiting for us.

3102
01:50:29,657 --> 01:50:30,858
SCOTT:
Oh, shit.

3103
01:50:30,992 --> 01:50:32,559
PAPA: So now I'm like,
"Oh, fuck. We're screwed."

3104
01:50:32,694 --> 01:50:34,996
Stan gets off the car.
He goes over to the cop.

3105
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,865
I'm thinking, "Oh, shit, he's
gonna fucking clock this cop.

3106
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:39,400
He's gonna, you know..."

3107
01:50:39,533 --> 01:50:41,402
And he goes right up to him,
grabs his face,

3108
01:50:41,535 --> 01:50:43,705
and he kisses him on the lips.

3109
01:50:43,838 --> 01:50:44,739
(laughter)

3110
01:50:44,872 --> 01:50:46,107
They went to high school
together.

3111
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,875
They went to fucking
high school together.

3112
01:50:48,009 --> 01:50:49,711
I'm like, "Only Stan
could get away with that."

3113
01:50:49,844 --> 01:50:51,112
I swear to God.

3114
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:52,413
Well, you know, the rumor is

3115
01:50:52,546 --> 01:50:53,915
that he got the coke
from the cops.

3116
01:50:54,048 --> 01:50:56,217
Not that cop. There was another
cop he knew in Manhattan.

3117
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,685
-(laughter) -What? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no! No.

3118
01:50:57,819 --> 01:50:59,453
-Coke? What? No.
-RAY: Guys, guys, guys.

3119
01:50:59,586 --> 01:51:01,555
-Guys, it's his dad.
-So?

3120
01:51:01,689 --> 01:51:02,724
-I didn't know it was a secret.
-RAY: It's his dad.

3121
01:51:02,857 --> 01:51:04,058
You can't just tease me
with that.

3122
01:51:04,191 --> 01:51:05,292
-Please, guys, but...
-It was...

3123
01:51:05,426 --> 01:51:07,028
You don't understand.
My mom, my mom tells me

3124
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:08,162
all these stories about how much

3125
01:51:08,295 --> 01:51:09,396
he's like a saint
and all that shit.

3126
01:51:09,530 --> 01:51:10,798
Like, I-I would love
to hear a coke story.

3127
01:51:10,932 --> 01:51:11,933
-Please.
-The PG-13 version.

3128
01:51:12,066 --> 01:51:13,367
No, you don't--
No, the real version.

3129
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,902
You don't understand the amount
of pressure I'm under,

3130
01:51:15,036 --> 01:51:16,570
-thinking this guy's perfect.
-All right, fuck it, fuck it.

3131
01:51:16,704 --> 01:51:18,205
All right, we were
coked out of our minds.

3132
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,540
-Nice.
-All right? We all were.

3133
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:21,542
-(laughing) -We all--
Well, I mean, uh, we were.

3134
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,410
-But that was a different time.
I mean, we all did it. -Right.

3135
01:51:23,544 --> 01:51:24,578
This guy was the cokehead.

3136
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:25,980
-You were the cokehead.
-All right.

3137
01:51:26,113 --> 01:51:27,949
I stopped four years ago.
You know that.

3138
01:51:28,082 --> 01:51:29,116
What are you talk--
How do you think

3139
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:30,251
he stayed this skinny
all these years?

3140
01:51:30,384 --> 01:51:31,618
No, I have a high metabolism.

3141
01:51:31,753 --> 01:51:34,055
They should have his face
on a nickel in Bolivia.

3142
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,190
(laughter)

3143
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,327
PAPA: But playtime
was playtime, all right?

3144
01:51:40,461 --> 01:51:42,830
Like, you know,
when he was at work,

3145
01:51:42,964 --> 01:51:45,767
he was, he was all,
you know, business.

3146
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,935
All right? And he was the guy
you wanted by your side

3147
01:51:48,069 --> 01:51:49,937
if-if you were
going into a fire.

3148
01:51:50,071 --> 01:51:51,272
Yeah, I mean,
if they were gonna,

3149
01:51:51,405 --> 01:51:53,307
like, build a fireman
from scratch,

3150
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,343
he would've been, you know...

3151
01:51:56,477 --> 01:51:57,611
-Prototype.
-Yeah. Yeah.

3152
01:51:57,745 --> 01:51:59,613
Exactly.
You know, top to bottom...

3153
01:51:59,747 --> 01:52:02,149
He's a fireman.

3154
01:52:02,283 --> 01:52:03,417
You know?

3155
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,120
-You know, as brave
as they come. -Yeah.

3156
01:52:06,253 --> 01:52:09,991
You know, I was thinking about
what you said at the game

3157
01:52:10,124 --> 01:52:13,761
about, you know, like,
firemen shouldn't have kids.

3158
01:52:15,763 --> 01:52:17,098
Let me tell you something.

3159
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:19,633
You know, your dad,
he didn't just die

3160
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:21,468
saving those two people
that night.

3161
01:52:21,602 --> 01:52:23,337
I mean, he did that a lot.

3162
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:24,939
You know, like, sometimes,

3163
01:52:25,072 --> 01:52:26,407
he wouldn't even
wait for the line.

3164
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,542
He'd just, he'd just go in,
like, a fully involved room,

3165
01:52:28,675 --> 01:52:30,277
and you're, like--
I'm like, "What are you doing?"

3166
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:33,647
And because if-if he heard
there was somebody in there,

3167
01:52:33,781 --> 01:52:35,682
he'd just go in.

3168
01:52:35,817 --> 01:52:37,351
That's the way, you know--
(stammers)

3169
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:38,685
He-- That's who he was.

3170
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:40,021
That's how he was built,
you know?

3171
01:52:40,154 --> 01:52:42,323
He couldn't, he couldn't
not be that way.

3172
01:52:44,358 --> 01:52:46,227
You understand?

3173
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:49,563
Thank you. No, thank you,
thank you for sharing.

3174
01:52:49,696 --> 01:52:51,698
That's awesome.

3175
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,334
He would slap the shit out of me

3176
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:56,470
if he heard me say this
about him, but he was a hero.

3177
01:52:58,205 --> 01:53:00,541
And heroes are necessary.

3178
01:53:00,674 --> 01:53:03,244
And they should be allowed
to have families, all right?

3179
01:53:03,377 --> 01:53:06,180
But I know it means, you know,

3180
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:08,883
that people suffer.

3181
01:53:09,016 --> 01:53:12,086
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

3182
01:53:12,219 --> 01:53:14,889
Well, but I'm sorry
for being a dick.

3183

-There's-there's two sides
to every story. -No.

3184
01:53:17,992 --> 01:53:20,928
Thank you for sharing with me.
Thanks for taking me here.

3185
01:53:21,062 --> 01:53:23,230
-All right, we don't
have to get all Oprah. -Yeah.

3186
01:53:23,364 --> 01:53:25,099
-(mutters) It's all right.
-Hey, to Stan.

3187
01:53:25,232 --> 01:53:26,100
-Yeah, Stan.
-Yeah, Stan.

3188
01:53:26,233 --> 01:53:28,669
-Stan. -Stan.
-Stan.

01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:12,613
This-this is why I don't drink.
I just, I just smoke weed.

3203
01:54:14,615 --> 01:54:16,650
Hey, so what are you gonna do?

3204
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:18,119
(Scott sighs)

3205
01:54:18,252 --> 01:54:20,988
With-with what?

3206
01:54:21,122 --> 01:54:22,756
With your life.

3207
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:26,593
You must be passionate
about something.

3208
01:54:28,229 --> 01:54:30,797
Um, yeah, the...
the tattoo thing.

3209
01:54:30,932 --> 01:54:33,200
I... I love that.

3210
01:54:34,635 --> 01:54:36,837
Were you, like, into that?

3211
01:54:36,971 --> 01:54:41,208
No, you know, it-it takes a lot
of practice, you know, and...

3212
01:54:42,977 --> 01:54:46,280
None of my friends will let me
tattoo them anymore and...

3213
01:54:46,413 --> 01:54:48,415
Hey, why don't you
give me a tattoo?

3214
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:50,985
What?

3215
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:52,286
What-what?

3216
01:54:52,419 --> 01:54:53,754
Come on, I don't have
any tattoos.

3217
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:56,823
I'm a, I'm a blank slate, man.
(chuckles)

3218
01:54:56,958 --> 01:54:58,825
Put it on my back.
Yeah, use it for practice.

3219
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,827
Well... well,
you're just saying this

3220
01:55:00,962 --> 01:55:02,296
'cause you're drunk, right?
You're not...

3221
01:55:02,429 --> 01:55:03,664
-You're not actually...
-Isn't everybody drunk

3222
01:55:03,797 --> 01:55:05,933
when they get
their first tattoo?

3223
01:55:06,067 --> 01:55:07,268
Touché, Ray.

3224
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:08,535
Yeah.

3225
01:55:08,669 --> 01:55:10,271
It's my back.
I don't give a fuck.

3226
01:55:10,404 --> 01:55:12,306
I'm never gonna see it.

3227
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:15,642
Plus, I got to tell you
something, you know.

3228
01:55:15,776 --> 01:55:18,345
I saw that drawing
you did for Harold.

3229
01:55:20,347 --> 01:55:23,217
I was kind of blown away
by it, man. You...

3230
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:25,219
You're getting
really good at it.

3231
01:55:25,352 --> 01:55:27,288
I'm practicing a lot.

3232
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:29,023
Yeah.

3233
01:55:29,156 --> 01:55:30,992
Like anything, you keep
doing it, you get better at it.

3234
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:32,626
And I, you know...

3235
01:55:32,759 --> 01:55:36,397
You know, I do want to see you
do well, all right?

3236
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:39,300
I-I believe in you.

3237
01:55:39,433 --> 01:55:40,867
Thanks, man.

3238
01:55:41,002 --> 01:55:43,804
You... you must really love me.

3239
01:55:43,937 --> 01:55:45,772
I love you, too.

3240
01:55:49,043 --> 01:55:50,877
Uh, I-I appreciate that,
but I'm not ready...

3241
01:55:51,012 --> 01:55:52,346
Y-You-you gonna say it back?

3242
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:54,148
I'm not ready to say
something like that.

3243
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:55,482
You got to say it back.

3244
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:56,950
What-what if I die tomorrow?

3245
01:55:58,385 --> 01:56:00,654
Then I'll be that guy saying,

3246
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:02,689
"You know, even though
I never said it..."

3247
01:56:02,823 --> 01:56:05,059
(both laughing)

3248
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:07,394
Uh, look...

3249
01:56:07,528 --> 01:56:09,030
I would love
to tattoo your back.

3250
01:56:09,163 --> 01:56:10,564
Okay, cool.

3251
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:13,900
All right, but here's the deal.
No unicorns.

3252
01:56:14,035 --> 01:56:15,902
-No rainbows, all right?
-Uh.

3253
01:56:16,037 --> 01:56:17,771
None of that shit
little girls like to color in.

3254
01:56:17,904 --> 01:56:18,772
(laughs):
Okay.

3255
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:20,607
No body parts. No nudity.

3256
01:56:20,741 --> 01:56:22,043
-Okay.
-No Chinese letters.

3257
01:56:22,176 --> 01:56:23,277
-All right. All right, fine.
-I want, I...

3258
01:56:23,410 --> 01:56:24,278
I want to be able
to fucking read

3259
01:56:24,411 --> 01:56:25,779
whatever you put back there.

3260
01:56:25,912 --> 01:56:28,382
I don't need some o-order for
orange chicken or some shit.

3261
01:56:28,515 --> 01:56:30,051
All right.

3262
01:56:30,184 --> 01:56:31,452
Here we go. You ready?

3263
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:33,420
Yep, let's do it.
Let's get it over with.

3264
01:56:33,554 --> 01:56:35,022
Yeah, I-I really
appreciate this.

3265
01:56:35,156 --> 01:56:37,891
This is--
It's actually very nice.

3266
01:56:38,025 --> 01:56:38,925
Good.

3267
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,228
All right.

3268
01:56:41,362 --> 01:56:42,729
(tattoo gun buzzing)

3269
01:56:43,764 --> 01:56:46,467
(groans) Fuck.

3270
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,701
(laughs)

3271
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:49,636
Dude, why do you get these?

3272
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:51,638
Um, I don't know. I, uh...

3273
01:56:51,772 --> 01:56:53,440
Whenever I'm going
through something, I just,

3274
01:56:53,574 --> 01:56:54,808
you know, I get one.

3275
01:56:54,941 --> 01:56:56,443
It relaxes me
and calms me down.

3276
01:56:56,577 --> 01:56:58,279
Helps me, like,
think things through, you know.

3277
01:56:58,412 --> 01:57:01,082
-This relaxes you?
-Yeah.

3278
01:57:01,215 --> 01:57:03,917
You ever think of taking,
like, a yoga class?

3279
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:05,552
Meditating?

3280
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:07,754
Why don't you just give blood?

3281
01:57:07,888 --> 01:57:09,623
(groans):
There's still needles involved.

3282
01:57:09,756 --> 01:57:11,258
Yeah, that's a nice tattoo.

3283
01:57:11,392 --> 01:57:12,593
It's aces.

3284
01:57:14,261 --> 01:57:16,263
-You looking at my cards,
you piece of shit? -What?

3285
01:57:16,397 --> 01:57:17,498
No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about the tattoo.

3286
01:57:17,631 --> 01:57:18,565
What are you doing?

3287
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:20,000
-What?
-First good hand you dealt me

3288
01:57:20,134 --> 01:57:21,268
all night, you're cheating?

3289
01:57:21,402 --> 01:57:22,569
-He was talking about
the tattoo. -Exactly.

3290
01:57:22,703 --> 01:57:24,971
-You are the worst liar ever.
-(laughter)

3291
01:57:25,106 --> 01:57:26,807
What's six times four?

3292
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:28,008
-24.
-(tattoo gun buzzing)

3293
01:57:28,142 --> 01:57:30,010
(groaning):
24. Yeah, 24.

3294
01:57:30,144 --> 01:57:32,146
What's seven times five?

3295
01:57:33,147 --> 01:57:34,115
(mouthing)

3296
01:57:34,248 --> 01:57:36,917
-35.
-Good job.

3297
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:38,585
Look how smart you are.
(groans)

3298
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:39,953
I'm trying to guess
what you're drawing

3299
01:57:40,087 --> 01:57:41,622
by the, by the way
your hand's going.

3300
01:57:41,755 --> 01:57:43,690
Remember, nothing weird
or I'll kill you.

3301
01:57:43,824 --> 01:57:45,359
-SCOTT: Nothing weird.
-Okay.

3302
01:57:45,492 --> 01:57:46,693
It doesn't look weird, does it?

3303
01:57:46,827 --> 01:57:48,028
No, not at all.

3304
01:57:48,162 --> 01:57:50,464
RAY: Oh, good, 'cause
you know I'll murder him.

3305
01:57:50,597 --> 01:57:51,998
It looks wonderful.

3306
01:57:52,133 --> 01:57:54,101
Oh! Is it supposed to hurt?

3307
01:57:54,235 --> 01:57:56,137
Is it supposed to hurt
that much?

3308
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:58,139
It's-it's a needle
going into your back. Yeah.

3309
01:57:58,272 --> 01:58:01,308
I know, but I thought
I had more back fat than that.

3310
01:58:01,442 --> 01:58:02,976
Can I get a tattoo?

3311
01:58:03,110 --> 01:58:03,977
-No. No.
-SCOTT: Sure.

3312
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:04,978
-All right.
-No.

3313
01:58:05,112 --> 01:58:05,979
Never.

3314
01:58:06,113 --> 01:58:07,414
Don't mess with perfection.

3315
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:10,451
(alarm ringing
and blaring loudly)

3316
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,785
WOMAN (over speakers):
Everybody goes.

3317
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:13,454
Both companies, first due.

3318
01:58:13,587 --> 01:58:15,722
Phone alarm. Box 3-4-3.

3319
01:58:15,856 --> 01:58:18,725
18 Carpenter Avenue
between Rockland and Franklin.

3320
01:58:18,859 --> 01:58:21,027
Smoke coming from the second-
floor window of a private home.

3321
01:58:21,162 --> 01:58:22,028
-(truck engine starts)
-Turnout.

3322
01:58:22,163 --> 01:58:24,831
(sirens wailing)

3323
01:58:33,674 --> 01:58:35,676
(birds chirping)

3324
01:58:37,678 --> 01:58:39,680
(pants) Yoo-hoo.

3325
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:41,182
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

3326
01:58:41,315 --> 01:58:42,516
Hey, man. How you doing?

3327
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:43,717
What's up, man?

3328
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:45,051
I need some assistance
over here, please.

3329
01:58:45,186 --> 01:58:46,420
-Sure, I...
-Hey, give me a sh...

3330
01:58:46,553 --> 01:58:48,422
-Oh, my God!
-Ah, don't worry about it.

3331
01:58:48,555 --> 01:58:50,891
Listen, everything's all good.

3332
01:58:51,024 --> 01:58:51,892
It's, uh, really nothing.

3333
01:58:52,025 --> 01:58:53,227
I just need a little assistance.

3334
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:54,861
This is something that needs
to be taken care of now.

3335
01:58:54,995 --> 01:58:56,730
What happened? Are you okay?
Did you get shot?

3336
01:58:56,863 --> 01:58:58,932
-Were you stabbed?
-It's not really a big deal.

3337
01:58:59,065 --> 01:59:00,734
My vape exploded in my pocket.
Just...

3338
01:59:00,867 --> 01:59:03,237
I didn't stretch
right before yoga.

3339
01:59:03,370 --> 01:59:05,872
I was playing tennis.
I slipped.

3340
01:59:06,006 --> 01:59:08,074
-Well, which one is it?
-What do you want me to say?

3341
01:59:08,209 --> 01:59:09,476
It was nothing.

3342
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:12,713
I just need some medical
attention, but just by you.

3343
01:59:12,846 --> 01:59:15,015
Dude, I got to call 911.
I don't know what to do.

3344
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:17,050
No, no, no, listen, listen.
No police, please.

3345
01:59:17,184 --> 01:59:18,252
Not today.

3346
01:59:18,385 --> 01:59:20,120
-What does that even mean?
-No.

3347
01:59:20,254 --> 01:59:21,922
We don't need to get
the government involved

3348
01:59:22,055 --> 01:59:22,956
into this situation.

3349
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:24,291
We can handle this together.

3350
01:59:24,425 --> 01:59:26,427
Dude, I'm so high.
I can't help you right now.

3351
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,429
I'm high, too.

3352
01:59:28,562 --> 01:59:30,631
Well, then you know how I feel.

3353
01:59:30,764 --> 01:59:32,799
-(groans)
-What do you want me to do?

3354
01:59:32,933 --> 01:59:34,235
Take a look at this.

3355
01:59:34,368 --> 01:59:35,936
I need some sort of foam.

3356
01:59:36,069 --> 01:59:37,471
-Holy shit!
-You got some stitching?

3357
01:59:37,604 --> 01:59:39,139
-Dude! -Do-do you have,
like, a little needle?

3358
01:59:39,273 --> 01:59:40,774
-Do you have something
with a needlepoint? -No.

3359
01:59:40,907 --> 01:59:42,075
What happened?

3360
01:59:42,209 --> 01:59:43,944
It was a misunderstanding.
It was an argument.

3361
01:59:44,077 --> 01:59:45,912
But we're all friends again.
We worked it out.

3362
01:59:46,046 --> 01:59:47,214
You know how buddies get.

3363
01:59:47,348 --> 01:59:49,283
Dude, I-- We-we, we got to
take you to the hospital

3364
01:59:49,416 --> 01:59:51,485
-or you're gonna die.
-I'm not gonna die.

3365
01:59:51,618 --> 01:59:52,786
-Yes, you are.
-I'm gonna die?

3366
01:59:52,919 --> 01:59:53,887
Yeah, I'm positive.

3367
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,055
I'm positive
that you're gonna die

3368
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:56,490
if we don't go to the hospital.

3369
01:59:56,623 --> 01:59:58,625
-(siren wailing)
-(man groans)

3370
02:00:01,362 --> 02:00:02,996
(man groans)

3371
02:00:03,129 --> 02:00:04,498
Are there metal detectors
in here?

3372
02:00:04,631 --> 02:00:05,899
I-I'm not sure. Why?

3373
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:07,401
Don't even worry about it.

3374
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:09,236
I'll tell you later.

3375
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:10,471
Oh, shit.

3376
02:00:10,604 --> 02:00:11,738
(groans)

3377
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:13,340
-Oh, fuck.
-You'll be all right.

3378
02:00:13,474 --> 02:00:14,841
-Oh, my God.
-You'll be all right.

3379
02:00:14,975 --> 02:00:16,443
-Guys, I need help!
-(groaning)

3380
02:00:16,577 --> 02:00:18,645
This guy's bleeding!
He's losing a lot of blood!

3381
02:00:18,779 --> 02:00:20,314
-I need a gurney, please!
-Oh, thank you.

3382
02:00:20,447 --> 02:00:21,848
-All right, just hold-- Put...
-Thank you.

3383
02:00:21,982 --> 02:00:24,150
-Put pressure on it, all right?
-(groaning)

3384
02:00:24,285 --> 02:00:26,119
Hi. This guy's been, uh,
either shot or stabbed.

3385
02:00:26,253 --> 02:00:28,188
I don't know. He's been
kind of vague about it.

3386
02:00:28,322 --> 02:00:30,491
Sir, have you been shot?
Stabbed?

3387
02:00:30,624 --> 02:00:31,625
No.

3388
02:00:31,758 --> 02:00:33,794
-I fell in a thorn bush.
-Okay.

3389
02:00:33,927 --> 02:00:35,596
Have him fill out
this paperwork,

3390
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:39,032
and the doctor will call you
when he's ready.

3391
02:00:39,165 --> 02:00:41,134
Do me a favor, man.
Can we just switch identities?

3392
02:00:41,268 --> 02:00:42,235
What? No.

3393
02:00:42,369 --> 02:00:43,637
Just let me use
your driver's license.

3394
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:45,939
-We look nothing alike, dude.
-No one's gonna know.

3395
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:47,441
Just trust me.

3396
02:00:47,574 --> 02:00:49,810
I'm bleeding.
It feels like I have to shit.

3397
02:00:49,943 --> 02:00:51,978
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3398
02:00:52,112 --> 02:00:53,246
I'm Margie's son. Do you know--

3399
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:54,281
-I'm Margie's son.
-(woman speaking Spanish)

3400
02:00:54,415 --> 02:00:56,350
I don't know who that is.

3401
02:00:56,483 --> 02:00:58,485
-I'm just filling in.
-(continues speaking Spanish)

3402
02:00:58,619 --> 02:01:00,053
Okay.

3403
02:01:00,186 --> 02:01:02,055
-I know.
-My pain keeps coming.

3404
02:01:02,188 --> 02:01:04,558
Tell that fucking cocksucker,
my father, that I hate him

3405
02:01:04,691 --> 02:01:07,528
and I love him at the same time
and I forgive him.

3406
02:01:07,661 --> 02:01:10,297
I-I-I do not need to do that,
because you're gonna live.

3407
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:13,967
Tell my sister
I know she's my mother.

3408
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:15,869
Huh.

3409
02:01:16,002 --> 02:01:17,871
Got here as soon as I could.

3410
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:19,573
Hey, man, we got to
help this guy.

3411
02:01:19,706 --> 02:01:20,574
He's bleeding out.

3412
02:01:20,707 --> 02:01:22,142
This a cop?

3413
02:01:22,275 --> 02:01:23,710
He looks like a cop.

3414
02:01:23,844 --> 02:01:25,011
Excuse me, ma'am.

3415
02:01:25,145 --> 02:01:26,347
Ray Bishop, Ladder 57.

3416
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:27,914
We got to get this guy
some help.

3417
02:01:28,048 --> 02:01:29,316
We got to move it along here.

3418
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:30,817
-Follow me.
-Okay, come on, buddy.

3419
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:32,052
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

3420
02:01:32,185 --> 02:01:33,520
Here we go, here we go,
here we go.

3421
02:01:33,654 --> 02:01:36,022
-(man groaning)
-All right.

3422
02:01:36,156 --> 02:01:37,558
Abdominal wound!

3423
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:38,859
RAY:
There we go.

3424
02:01:38,992 --> 02:01:40,193
Where? Where?

3425
02:01:40,327 --> 02:01:41,528
Put him in Two.

3426
02:01:41,662 --> 02:01:42,563
In Two.

3427
02:01:42,696 --> 02:01:44,097
DOCTOR:
Let's get vitals.

3428
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:45,566
-All right, buddy.
-All right, get him right here.

3429
02:01:45,699 --> 02:01:46,733
We got to get your shirt off.

3430
02:01:46,867 --> 02:01:48,201
Let me know if you need trauma.

3431
02:01:48,335 --> 02:01:50,203
-(groans): Oh, shit.
-Okay. Here we go.

3432
02:01:50,337 --> 02:01:52,839
-Nice and easy, nice and easy.
-I'll meet you at Six. Six.

3433
02:01:52,973 --> 02:01:54,841
(man groans)

3434
02:01:54,975 --> 02:01:57,077
JOY:
You okay? It's gonna be okay.

3435
02:01:57,210 --> 02:01:58,679
(mutters)

3436
02:02:04,351 --> 02:02:05,586
He's one of your friends?

3437
02:02:05,719 --> 02:02:07,688
No, no, no.
I-I was just helping him.

3438
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:09,122
Yeah, Scott brought him in.

3439
02:02:09,255 --> 02:02:10,857
You know, guy just kind of
wandered into the firehouse

3440
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:12,092
while we were out on a call.

3441
02:02:12,225 --> 02:02:14,361
You guys are covered in blood.
Take these off.

3442
02:02:14,495 --> 02:02:15,896
Throw 'em here.

3443
02:02:18,665 --> 02:02:20,401
Put 'em over here.

3444
02:02:20,534 --> 02:02:21,802
Just leave 'em there.
Down there.

3445
02:02:21,935 --> 02:02:22,903
What's that?

3446
02:02:23,036 --> 02:02:25,772
-What's that?
-Oh.

3447
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:29,209
I let your son practice on me.

3448
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:31,412
How's it look? He won't let me
see it till it's done.

3449
02:02:31,545 --> 02:02:33,113
Let me see it.

3450
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:43,724
He, um, he-he let me do
whatever I wanted, so...

3451
02:02:45,892 --> 02:02:47,394
Jesus Christ.

3452
02:02:47,528 --> 02:02:50,664
RAY: He didn't put anything
stupid on there, did he?

3453
02:02:50,797 --> 02:02:52,232
Took forever.

3454
02:02:58,405 --> 02:02:59,806
(Margie sighs)

3455
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:11,585
Nah.

3456
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:15,522
SCOTT: Yeah, I, um...
I can never get the eyes right

3457
02:03:15,656 --> 02:03:17,624
'cause I-I just make them
too dark, but I-I...

3458
02:03:17,758 --> 02:03:19,593
It's beautiful.

3459
02:03:20,827 --> 02:03:22,629
I'm proud of you.

3460
02:03:22,763 --> 02:03:25,298
-You could really do this.
-Thanks.

3461
02:03:25,432 --> 02:03:26,800
There's not any, like,
Chinese characters

3462
02:03:26,933 --> 02:03:28,469
or anything back there,
is there?

3463
02:03:29,503 --> 02:03:30,837
No, no.

3464
02:03:30,971 --> 02:03:31,938
No, no, no.

3465
02:03:32,072 --> 02:03:33,339
You told me not to.

3466
02:03:33,474 --> 02:03:35,041
I would never disobey you.

3467
02:03:35,175 --> 02:03:37,478
Thank you for letting him
do this, Ray.

3468
02:03:37,611 --> 02:03:39,513
Oh, I didn't do anything.
I just sat there.

3469
02:03:39,646 --> 02:03:40,714
He did all the work.

3470
02:03:40,847 --> 02:03:43,116
You liked going over the spine,
didn't ya?

3471
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:45,018
Took it like a champ.

3472
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:46,319
I sat there wincing.

3473
02:03:46,453 --> 02:03:47,688
(chuckles)

3474
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:53,460
Oh, my God.

3475
02:03:53,594 --> 02:03:55,061
Can we at least
close the curtain?

3476
02:03:55,195 --> 02:03:57,297
-Oh. My guys. -Guys,
people die in here, all right?

3477
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:00,066
-My guys. My guys.
-Uh... -Aw, come on.

3478
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,636
Mom, I don't want to hug him.
He's not wearing a shirt.

3479
02:04:02,769 --> 02:04:04,871
-Come on, you can handle it.
-Ah, dude, you're so smooth.

3480
02:04:05,005 --> 02:04:06,973
You're-you're like a sea otter.

3481
02:04:07,107 --> 02:04:08,341
-(Margie laughs)
-Please, we have to stop.

3482
02:04:08,475 --> 02:04:09,610
We have to stop.
Please. Please.

3483
02:04:09,743 --> 02:04:11,111
-Please stop? Please stop.
-(Margie chuckles)

3484
02:04:11,244 --> 02:04:13,313
But first, you will get to Lord
and Lady Stark and you will...

3485
02:04:13,446 --> 02:04:15,148
SCOTT: I hung out with,
like, Ray and the guys

3486
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:17,651
from the firehouse
the other night at the bar,

3487
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:20,220
and, um, they were just telling
all these stories about Dad.

3488
02:04:20,353 --> 02:04:22,355
And there were stories
I never heard of before,

3489
02:04:22,489 --> 02:04:25,058
like, you know, about him,
like, doing coke

3490
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:27,661
and being hilarious.

3491
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:28,862
-Yeah.
-You know?

3492
02:04:28,995 --> 02:04:30,531
Yeah. Yeah.

3493
02:04:32,533 --> 02:04:34,768
Well, he was hilarious.

3494
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:36,670
Yeah.

3495
02:04:36,803 --> 02:04:38,204
Uh...

3496
02:04:38,338 --> 02:04:42,008
He was also
out of control and crazy.

3497
02:04:42,142 --> 02:04:44,911
-Do you understand?
-You can't. (grunts)

3498
02:04:45,045 --> 02:04:46,913
Why-why didn't you just tell me?

3499
02:04:47,047 --> 02:04:48,515
I don't know.

3500
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:51,051
I just-- I wanted you to have
some good memories

3501
02:04:51,184 --> 02:04:52,385
to offset what happened.

3502
02:04:52,519 --> 02:04:53,854
I didn't know what to-to say.

3503
02:04:53,987 --> 02:04:57,257
Was I gonna say, "Your dad
really loved watching cartoons

3504
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:59,760
with you 'cause he was
tripping all the time"?

3505
02:04:59,893 --> 02:05:01,595
-Yeah.
-(scoffs)

3506
02:05:01,728 --> 02:05:04,230
Sounds like a good dad to me.

3507
02:05:04,364 --> 02:05:05,566
No, you know what?

3508
02:05:05,699 --> 02:05:07,400
Uh, I get it.

3509
02:05:07,534 --> 02:05:12,806
Knowing that he had
his issues and... problems

3510
02:05:12,939 --> 02:05:16,042
just like everybody else,
it makes me feel better.

3511
02:05:16,176 --> 02:05:19,546
It really...
it really humanizes him.

3512
02:05:20,681 --> 02:05:23,550
Well, he was a great guy.

3513
02:05:23,684 --> 02:05:25,686
He was a very complicated guy.

3514
02:05:27,688 --> 02:05:30,423
He had a really big heart.

3515
02:05:30,557 --> 02:05:31,625
Mm.

3516
02:05:31,758 --> 02:05:33,393
Like, like Ray?

3517
02:05:34,895 --> 02:05:36,630
Uh...

3518
02:05:36,763 --> 02:05:38,965
Yeah, I guess, like Ray, yeah.

3519
02:05:39,099 --> 02:05:40,400
Yeah.

3520
02:05:40,533 --> 02:05:43,269
Yeah. (laughs)

3521
02:05:43,403 --> 02:05:47,674
Um, I guess you could say
that you have a type.

3522
02:05:47,808 --> 02:05:49,242
Uh-huh.

3523
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:51,177
Yeah. (smacks lips)

3524
02:05:51,311 --> 02:05:53,013
I have a type.

3525
02:05:53,146 --> 02:05:54,781
(laughs)

3526
02:05:58,752 --> 02:06:03,990
I know we don't really talk
about it much, but...

3527
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,928
...I, uh...

3528
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:09,630
I-I miss Dad.

3529
02:06:11,064 --> 02:06:12,833
A lot.

3530
02:06:17,804 --> 02:06:19,239
Yeah.

3531
02:06:21,507 --> 02:06:22,943
Me, too.

3532
02:06:28,248 --> 02:06:29,950
(breath trembles)

3533
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:31,517
And, uh...

3534
02:06:34,154 --> 02:06:38,024
I'm sorry that I've been

3535
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:41,027
so difficult to deal with.

3536
02:06:41,161 --> 02:06:42,896
I'll...

3537
02:06:43,029 --> 02:06:44,731
I'll try and...

3538
02:06:44,865 --> 02:06:46,667
get it together.

3539
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,434
It's just hard.

3540
02:06:50,436 --> 02:06:52,839
I think it'll always be hard.

3541
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:04,851
(breath trembles)

3542
02:07:05,886 --> 02:07:07,754
I, uh...

3543
02:07:07,888 --> 02:07:09,555
(chuckles):
I really like Ray, but I--

3544
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:11,191
He's-he's got to lose
that mustache.

3545
02:07:11,324 --> 02:07:12,325
I mean, come on.

3546
02:07:12,458 --> 02:07:14,160
-(laughs)
-When we go out in public,

3547
02:07:14,294 --> 02:07:15,762
people think that
I'm kidnapped, you know?

3548
02:07:15,896 --> 02:07:17,998
The looks that we get
at the supermarket.

3549
02:07:18,131 --> 02:07:19,766
They're like--
People-people look at me like,

3550
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,868
"Are you okay?"
And I'm like, "Yeah, no, yeah.

3551
02:07:22,002 --> 02:07:23,536
It's my mom's boyfriend."

3552
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:25,505
(Margie laughing)

3553
02:07:32,512 --> 02:07:34,380
-All right, buddy, good luck.
-Thanks for the lift.

3554
02:07:34,514 --> 02:07:35,515
All right, man.

3555
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:37,183
Confidence, right?

3556
02:07:37,317 --> 02:07:39,519
-Yeah.
-All right, go get 'em.

3557
02:07:41,888 --> 02:07:43,089
SCOTT:
Hey.

3558
02:07:44,157 --> 02:07:46,559
Kelsey. Hi.

3559
02:07:46,693 --> 02:07:48,394
Hey. How are you?

3560
02:07:48,528 --> 02:07:50,630
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, I just, uh...

3561
02:07:50,764 --> 02:07:52,298
I-I just wanted to talk to you.

3562
02:07:52,432 --> 02:07:54,434
Well, I have
my civil service test today.

3563
02:07:54,567 --> 02:07:55,736
Oh, yeah, I-I remembered.

3564
02:07:55,869 --> 02:07:57,303
That's why I wanted to,
you know...

3565
02:07:57,437 --> 02:07:58,972
-I have to go.
-Can I come?

3566
02:07:59,105 --> 02:08:00,273
What? Why?

3567
02:08:00,406 --> 02:08:02,208
You know, for, like,
moral support.

3568
02:08:02,342 --> 02:08:05,245
I just want to be there for you.

3569
02:08:05,378 --> 02:08:07,814
-Well, I can't stop you.
-Oh, all right, great.

3570
02:08:07,948 --> 02:08:09,783
Y-Your hair looks nice.

3571
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:11,484
Thanks.

(seagulls squawking)

3574
02:08:23,730 --> 02:08:25,498
Listen, I know you probably
want to talk about

3575
02:08:25,631 --> 02:08:28,234
relationship stuff and
serious bullshit, but I can't.

3576
02:08:28,368 --> 02:08:31,571
I have to study and focus right
now so I don't screw this up.

3577
02:08:31,704 --> 02:08:32,773
Okay.

3578
02:08:32,906 --> 02:08:34,107
I, um...

3579
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:36,309
I can help you, if you like.

3580
02:08:36,442 --> 02:08:38,011
You don't want to help me.

3581
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:40,413
Mm, yeah, I do.
I would love to.

3582
02:08:42,749 --> 02:08:45,251
Okay, w-will you just
test me on this part?

3583
02:08:45,385 --> 02:08:47,921
Yeah. That one?

3584
02:08:48,054 --> 02:08:49,489
-All right.
-Okay.

3585
02:08:49,622 --> 02:08:51,124

Three hours and 40 minutes.

Did-did you just guess that
or did know the answer?

3595
02:09:13,579 --> 02:09:15,448
No, that's correct.

3596
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,050
(chuckles):
That's incredible.

3597

-Wow.
-It's not that amazing.

-It is, no.
-Relax.

3599

I-I-- Is it all math questions?

3600
02:09:21,587 --> 02:09:22,989
I thought it was, like,
city shit.

3601
02:09:23,123 --> 02:09:24,190
No, no.

3602
02:09:24,324 --> 02:09:25,859
You have to prove
that you're not stupid,

3603
02:09:25,992 --> 02:09:27,627
and then you can
work for the city.

Oh. Oh.

So I can never
work for the city.

A lot.

3611
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:46,646
I-I always have, and I, um...

3612
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:49,215
That's why I always
act so weird.

3613
02:09:49,349 --> 02:09:53,053
'Cause I don't know
how to express myself.

02:13:04,844 --> 02:13:08,848
* I'll be fine once I get it *

3671
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:12,785
* I'll be good *

3672
02:13:12,918 --> 02:13:16,589
* Pursuit of happiness *

3673
02:13:16,722 --> 02:13:17,923
* Yeah *

3674
02:13:19,925 --> 02:13:21,894

3675
02:13:22,028 --> 02:13:24,697

3677
02:13:26,832 --> 02:13:30,903
* Ooh... *

3678
02:13:31,904 --> 02:13:34,707
* Ooh *

3679
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:37,877
* Oh, never, never, never *

3680
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:40,380
* Did I ever stop to think *

3681
02:13:40,513 --> 02:13:42,982
* That I'd find myself
here with you *

3682
02:13:43,116 --> 02:13:45,418
* In your own world of dreams *

3683
02:13:45,551 --> 02:13:48,054
* Oh, but here I am *

3684
02:13:48,188 --> 02:13:50,556
* Again with you *

3685
02:13:50,690 --> 02:13:52,958
* You are my joy *

3686
02:13:53,093 --> 02:13:55,895
* And my joy is you *

3687
02:13:56,028 --> 02:13:58,431
* Never, never *

3688
02:13:58,564 --> 02:14:03,236
* Never did I ever
stop loving you *

3689
02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:05,671
* Yeah *

3690
02:14:05,805 --> 02:14:08,174
* Sometimes I stop and ask *

3691
02:14:08,308 --> 02:14:10,610
* And wonder where you were *

3692
02:14:10,743 --> 02:14:13,479
* Then I rip you from my mind *

3693
02:14:13,613 --> 02:14:15,681
* 'Cause I thought
you didn't care *

3694
02:14:15,815 --> 02:14:18,284
* Oh, but here I am *

3695
02:14:18,418 --> 02:14:20,686
* Again with you *

3696
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:23,123
* This time I know *

3697
02:14:23,256 --> 02:14:26,025
* What my heart can do *

3698
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:28,594
* Never, never *

3699
02:14:28,728 --> 02:14:33,199
* Never did I ever
stop loving you *

3700
02:14:33,333 --> 02:14:34,967
* Yeah *

3701
02:14:36,436 --> 02:14:40,273
* I don't know why *

3702
02:14:40,406 --> 02:14:43,509
* I had to play the game
of losing you *

3703
02:14:43,643 --> 02:14:45,378
* To make me see *

3704
02:14:45,511 --> 02:14:47,680
* That I still love you *

3705
02:14:47,813 --> 02:14:50,950
* Oh, yeah *

3706
02:14:51,083 --> 02:14:53,386
* But here I am *

3707
02:14:53,519 --> 02:14:55,888
* Again with you *

3708
02:14:56,021 --> 02:14:58,358
* You are my joy *

3709
02:14:58,491 --> 02:15:01,060
* And my joy is you *

3710
02:15:01,194 --> 02:15:03,796
* Never, never *

3711
02:15:03,929 --> 02:15:08,368
* Never did I ever
stop loving you *

3712
02:15:08,501 --> 02:15:11,036
* Oh, no, oh, no *

3713
02:15:11,171 --> 02:15:15,341
* Never, never,
ooh, never, baby *

3714
02:15:15,475 --> 02:15:18,043
* Did I ever stop loving you *

3715
02:15:18,178 --> 02:15:19,479
* I just can't stop *

3716
02:15:19,612 --> 02:15:20,880
* No, no, no *

3717
02:15:21,013 --> 02:15:24,984
* Never, never, never *

3718
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:28,020
* Did I ever stop loving you *

3719
02:15:28,154 --> 02:15:30,556
* Ooh *

3720
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:32,692
* Never, baby *

3721
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:37,863
* Did I stop loving you *

3722
02:15:37,997 --> 02:15:40,533
* Oh, no, oh *

3723
02:15:40,666 --> 02:15:44,570
* Never, never, never *

3724
02:15:44,704 --> 02:15:47,707
* Did I ever stop
loving you, baby *

3725
