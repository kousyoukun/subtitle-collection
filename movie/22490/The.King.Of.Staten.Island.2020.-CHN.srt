00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,298
这电影逻辑不对啊
This movie makes no sense.

55
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,301
为什么 为什么政府允许人类清除计划的存在
Why-why would the government make a purge legal?

56
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,971
很明显他们是来泄愤的撒 是啊

- Clearly to let them blow off some steam. Hello.- Yeah.

57
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:35,108
那你可以去做水疗啊 是的 或是去找心理医生啊
- That's why you go to the spa. - Yeah. Or the therapist.

58
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:37,343
或者去做指甲 或者
- Or get your nails done. -  Or...

59
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:39,245
或者杀点人咯
Or murder some folks. Hmm?

60
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:41,180

I mean, come on, guys. I-I brought Tara over

61
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:43,116
就是为了让大家走出这个地下室
so that we could get out of this basement.

62
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,784
我们出门儿玩儿吧  去蹦迪吧

我们不蹦迪
We don't dance.

00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,358
看《人类清除计划》 还不够 -不够

What's your favorite move?

73
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:01,435
就那种有律动的摇摆
It's kind of like a shake.

74
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,935
摇摆 额   说不上来啦
- A shake? That's...- I don't know.

75
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,271
就跟着音乐摇摆呗
I just do whatever the m-music tells me to do.

76
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,340
就是舞池里的混蛋
There's nothing but douchebags at these clubs.

God, you just sit here all day,

79
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:13,079
吸大麻 然后一起滚床单吗
- and then smoke weed and jerk each other off.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,147

90
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,228
所以是你让我染上的披衣菌

你助长了披衣菌的传播
You assisted the chlamydia.

00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:22,542
但是没事儿啊  我挺开心的
But it's okay. I-I had fun.

153
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,976
我感觉也挺好
I had fun back there.

154
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,311
是嘛
Yeah.

155
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:27,947
我很遗憾都没有满足到你
You know, I feel bad that you never do.

156
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,215
不 我很满足啊
No, I-I do all the time.

157
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,884
我只是没有你表现的那么明显而已
I just... you know, I don't put on a Broadway show like you do.

158
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,152
我比较安静
You know, I'm-I'm more quiet.

159
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:35,054
我的高潮跟卓别林哑剧比较像
I'm more like Charlie Chaplin when I come.
160
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,523
像看哑剧一样的爽  对就是这样
- Like a silent movie.- Silent movie.



162
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,227
额 你觉得是因为抗抑郁的药物的作用吗
Um, do you think it's the antidepressants?

163
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,429
嗯 是吧
Oh, yeah, for sure.

164
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,163
是啊 如果不是吃了抗抑郁的药
Yeah. If I didn't have the antidepressants,

165
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,599
我8秒就射了
I'd come in, like, eight seconds.

166
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:46,932
然后你的高潮就没有了
And then you wouldn't come.

167
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,334
然后你会抑郁的
And then you'd be depressed.

168
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:51,103
然后你就得吃抗抑郁的药了
And then you would have to take antidepressants.

169
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,107
我不知道呢 我能发表下我的想法么我  你说
- I don't know, can I say something? I, um...- Yeah.

170
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:59,111
我就是不能理解为啥咱俩要这般偷鸡摸狗呢
I just still don't understand why this is such a big secret.

171
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:02,181
你懂为什么的呀 因为咱俩这是特殊关系呀
You know why it's a big secret.'Cause it's special.

172
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,451
这是我们之间的小秘密啊。
It's-it's, like, our thing, you know?

173
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:08,187
如果大家都知道了我们的关系就不特殊了呢
It-it wouldn't be special if everybody knew about it.

174
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,458
话虽如此 但我不想我俩只是这样的关系啊
Yeah, but I don't just want to do this.

175
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:14,126
懂 我理解  那我们以后还要这么搞么
Yeah, I totally get that. So, should we stop?

176
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,294
我不是这个意思
No, I...

177
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:19,466
我不知道怎么说 我们这算什么呀
I don't know, like, this... like, what is this?

178
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,033
我不知道为啥  这关系
- And I don't know why... - This?

179
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,035
咱们这是   我只想像正常人一样
- This is... - I want to do what normal people do.

180
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,571
我懂 我只是 你知道的 我
Yeah, I know. I just, you know, I...

181
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,105
公开很奇怪啊
It-it might be weird, you know.

182
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,074
我们都认识对方那么久了
We've known each other for, like, ever.

183
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,376
从小学四年级开始吧
Since fourth grade.

184
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,043
公开的话感觉像乱伦一样
It would be like incest.

185
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:31,944
不会啦
No, it wouldn't.

186
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,145
会啊 感觉就是我们一直是好朋友 
No, it's like, yeah, w-we're best pals,

187
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,948
我不想因为这个伤到 我们的友谊
and I wouldn't want to, like,jeopardize our friendship

188
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,552
或者友谊就被其他什么取代了
or something like that over something...

189
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:42,288
不是不对 就是这样风险很大
not silly, but, you know, it's just... it's a big risk.

190
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,256
但是我们已经发生关系了呀
But we've already done the deed.

191
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,393
我说还有啥阻碍的  已经发生关系了
- I mean, what else is there? - "Done the deed"?

192
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:48,462
我不知道啦 但是 
-  I don't know.- But, you know, it's just,

193
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,263
你以后一定会遇到一个比我更好的人  什么
- you deserve somebody way better than me. - What?

194
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,299
你已经很好了
You're a good guy.

195
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:55,369
你很好啊 我喜欢你  额
- You're a good guy. I like you.- Uh...

196
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:56,302
好吧  你为什么这么说
Well, I... Based on what?

197
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:59,373
我也喜欢你啊 就像
I mean, I like you, too. It's just like...



199
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,242
好吧 我 跟你说 我可以跟你说个事儿么
All right, can I just tell you... can I tell you something?

200
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,144
但只有你知道不要告诉别人
But can you, like, not tell anybody?

201
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:08,347
可能别人也知道吧 但是 就像
Well, people probably know, but, like... (sighs)

202
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,550
我可能有毛病
There's, like, something wrong with me.

203
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,985
精神疾病  啥
- Like, mentally, like... - What?

204
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,088
我发病的时候
Like, I'm not okay up there.

205
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:18,124
就像
You know? Like...

206
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,360
我会变得癫狂 像疯子一样
I-I get all mad, acting, like, crazy,

207
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:23,697
然后我真的会神志不清 做一些冲动的事情
and I, and I make really insane,impulsive decisions.

208
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,365
然后我
And I get...

209
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,636
我自己都怕自己 但我不想
I'm d... I'm scared o-of myself, and I don't...

210
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:31,638
我不想吓到你或和我自己
I don't want to, like, scare you or me

211
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,239
或者伤到其他人 你懂吗
or, like, hurt anyone, you know?

212
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,341
所以我想最好
So, I think it would just be best

213
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:39,311
我应该还是离你远点好
and really responsible of me if I just backed off, you know?

214
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,717
你不要这么想你自己嘛
I don't want you to f-feel like that about yourself.

215
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,452
不是我这么想自己 是
Oh, no, it's...

216
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,220
我只是我不想冒犯到你 懂么
I just, I just don't want to offend you, you know?

217
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:51,290
你最好了 你是（世界上）最好的人
You're... you're the best. I think you're the greatest.

218
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:54,193
我知道你觉得我很好 我是很好
I know you think I'm great. I'm awesome.

219
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,264
我只是很抱歉你看低了你自己
I feel bad that you don't think you're great.





224
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,597
早啊 亲爱的
Hey, honey.

225
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,232
我给你做了煎蛋卷
I made you an omelet.

226
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:37,437
你打算穿啥去你妹妹的毕业典礼啊
What are you gonna wear to your sister's graduation party?

227
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:41,475
我在想要要不你穿你爹的西服吧
I was thinking, what about one of your dad's suits?

228
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:42,542
我知道啊
I don't know.

229
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,412
我觉得不太适合穿西服吧
I-I don't think I'm really a suit guy, you know?

230
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,080
再说那些西服都过时了 所以
Plus-plus, all those suits are out of style, so...

231
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,083
我觉得他们很复古啊
You know, I thought they were back in style.

232
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:55,020
还有你去聚会前咱能不吸大麻么
And... can you not smoke pot before the party?

233
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,222
为毛
Why?

234
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,257
因为太臭了 到时你浑身都裹着臭味
Because it smells. You smell bad.

235
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,427
也别吸电子烟 不然人家会以为你吸了大麻
And no vaping because they're gonna think it's pot.

236
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,293
那个叔叔是个警察
The uncle is a cop.

237
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,062
我们别给自己找麻烦
We don't need that kind of trouble.

238
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,564
去他妈的
Fuck that guy.

239
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,366
我讨厌这个家
I hate this family.

240
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,034
他们浑身铜臭又傲慢
They're so rich and snooty.

241
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,604
他们对Clare很好啊
They've been really nice to Claire.

242
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,405
嘿 老妈 可以给几个塑料箱子么
Hey, Mom. You got me the plastic containers.

243
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:14,474
我只需要几个纸箱丢不要的东西
I just need the cardboard boxes I can throw away.

244
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:16,776
但是他们很擅长分类
But they're so good for storing things.

245
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,512
我没啥需要收纳的
Yeah, but I don't have any storage.

246
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,447
我衣橱只有两尺宽呢
- My closet's, like, two feet wide.


247
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,517
嘿 Chaire 你要我去你毕业典礼么
Hey, Claire, do you even want me at your graduation party?

248
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,386
我想让你去吗 我是无所谓了
Do I want you to go? I don't care.

249
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,255
只是 你不去会显得很奇怪
Just... It's weird if you don't go.

250
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,490
好像不是很想我去啊
That wasn't exactly a warm invitation.

251
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,659
哈 好吧 我也不是很想邀请你
Yeah, well, it's not the part I'm looking forward to most.

252
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:34,260
但我想你他还是去吧
But I want you to be there.

253
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:36,262
她邀请你去了  不她不想
 She wants you to go.  No, she doesn't.

254
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,163
她刚说了呀   不 我不想他去
- She just said it.-  No, I don't want him to go.

255
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:40,534
他得去
He has to go.

256
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,202
就不要全程缩在沙发上的一个角落就行
Just don't sit on the couch in the corner the whole time.

257
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,538
太诡异了  我没觉得
- It's weird. - No, I don't see the problem

258
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:45,639
坐在一个角落里有啥问题啊
with sitting in the corner, okay?

259
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,841
聚会上有些人会去舞池里跳舞
There's some people that go to the party and dance,

260
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,776
有些人就是会坐在角落看而已
and there's some people that sit in the corner.

261
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:50,777
我就是那个坐角落的人而已
I'm the corner guy.

262
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,245
爱不爱 你哥哥我就是这样一个人 
Accept your brother.

263
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,382
还有别想 跟Layla上床啊 
Also, don't try to fuck Layla, okay?

264
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:57,149
她都跟你说了她对你没兴趣
She told you she's not interested.

265
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,485
你说啥呢
What are you talking about?

266
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:00,286
我从来没想跟她在一起啊
I never tried to hook up with her.

267
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,122
是她自己一直想勾搭我 我考虑到你的感受
She's always trying to fuck me,and I-I have to avoid it

268
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:06,626
不惜一切代价 躲着她 
at all costs, out of respect for you.

269
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,295
我只是觉得她穿裤子很好看而已
I just thought she looked really good in those pants.

270
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,297
我去 这是个称赞好吧
- Jesus. - Thought that was a nice thing to say.

271
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,633
别说了 我还以为你会回应我你也赞同呢
- Just don't. - I didn't know I would get MeToo'd for it.

272
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,535
你爹的西服塑封着放在车库里 
Dad's suits are vacuum-sealed in the garage.

273
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,637
哦   你自己选个中意的吧
- Yeah? - Just pick yourself a nice one.

274
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,171
你得好好打扮下
You have to look nice.

275
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,340
我们是去庆祝你妹妹获得的成就的
We're celebrating your sister's achievements.

276
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:23,710
等她不在了你会想她的
You're gonna miss her when she's gone.

277
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,580
是啊 为我庆祝吧
Yeah. Celebrate me.



280
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,353
哇 时间过得真快呀
Wow, this, uh... this all happened so fast.

281
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,521
真不敢相信你这么就毕业了
I-I can't believe you're graduating already.

282
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,126
我会想你的
I'm gonna really miss you.

283
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,368
第二回合
Round two.

284
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,502
开打
- Fight!


285
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,571
哟 你从哪儿搞到这个的啊
Yo, where'd you get this?

286
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,640
这玩意儿味道不是很好啊
This shit does not taste very good.

287
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,442
你说啥呢 这玩意儿很猛的 不识货的家伙
What are you talking about? This shit's fire, dawg.

288
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:31,378
你们现在还嗑药么
Do you guys even really get high anymore?

289

485
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:36,809
- 这就是为什么  - 有些还是受害者呢

说起来你为什么要给我安排工作
Why are you offering me a job anyway?

496
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:01,300
因为我跟你父亲保证我会照顾你
Because I told your father I'd always look out for you.

497
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,269

540
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,209
告诉你 你没见过他才是幸运的

544
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:57,750
然后你这辈子就不会再好了

545
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,419
但你还能怎样呢
Okay, like, but what are you gonna do?

546
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,688
你准备去找工作还是离开家
Are you gonna get a job or are you gonna leave the house?

547
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:03,856
不知道
I don't know.

548
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,393

It's never been done, not even as a joke.

554
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,302
那是因为没人想去餐厅吃饭的同时
Because no one wants to go to a restaurant

555
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,804
还得看着别人文身
and watch people get tattooed while they eat.

556
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,840
- 太恶心了  - 这个主意最棒了

- Chicken and tattoos.  - That's not a business!

559
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,913
知道吗 你必须振作起来
You know, you got to get your shit together.

560

Time is passing by very quickly.

561
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:30,283
这就是为什么我一天到晚抽大麻 好吧
That's why I smoke weed all the time, okay?

562
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,351
它会让时间慢下来
It slows it all down.

563
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:34,020
听不懂人话
Fucking God.

564
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,922
我这是在担心你
See, I'm worried about you.

565
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,790
现在担心什么 你不是从来不关心的么
Well, why now? You never gave a shit.

566
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:39,792
你 这一秒之前 一直也没鸟过我
You, like, literally never cared until this second.

567
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:40,993
有什么动机吗
Like, wh-what, what gives?

568
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:42,828
你从没有罩过我一次
You never looked out for me once.

569
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:43,664
你是我哥哥
You're my older brother.

570
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,164
难道不是应该你罩着我吗
You're supposed to look out for me.

571
00:20:45,198 --> 00:20:46,933
你 你只是因为要走了所以心中有愧吧
You're-you're just guilty 'cause you're leaving?

572
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,301
现在突然间 你就一下子开始担心我要死了
Now, all of a sudden, you're afraid I'm gonna die?

573
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,903
我终究会死 你走不走都一样
I was gonna die anyway, whether you stay or not.

574
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:53,005
- 你要自残吗  - 有可能
- Are you gonna hurt yourself?  - Probably.

575
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,508
是啊 我有可能会自残
Yeah, I'm probably gonna hurt myself.

576
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,309
还没想好怎么做 但会的
I don't know how, but yeah.

577
00:20:57,777 --> 00:21:01,047
我就是最有可能这么做的人了
If anybody could do it, it's me.

578
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,916
这就是为什么我不想理你 因为我知道
This is why I don't talk to you, 'cause the one thing I know is

579
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,420
你不会听我的 所以
you're not gonna listen to my advice, so...

580
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:07,787
斯科特:是啊 我为什么要听
SCOTT: Yeah, well, why would I?

581
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,955
你根本就不在乎
Like, you don't even give a shit.

582
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:09,789
你 你还要走呢
You're-you're leaving.

583
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:10,890
你都不属于这个家了
You're not even part of the family.

584
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:13,326
我他妈才是这个家里唯一的正常人
I'm the only fucking normal person in this family.

585
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,094
天哪 你知道吗
Jesus. You know...

586
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:17,763
我不在你身边的每一秒我都在担心你
Every second I'm away from you, I'm worrying about you.

587
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:19,232
你就是这样让人担心
That's what you do to people.

588
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,266
你就该担心
You should be worried.

589
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,103
好了 别破坏我对大学的向往了
Okay, don't fucking ruin college for me, okay?

590
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,104
滚
Go!

591
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,305
好啊
Fine.

592
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,508
嘿 你真该把这讨喜的性格带到大学里去
Hey, you should bring that chipper personality to college.

593
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,276
男生都喜欢
Guys will love it.

594
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,312
你好
Hello.

597
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:41,187
好的 我先看看我的日程安排
Okay, let's see my to-do list.

598
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,156
我们已经把行李装到车上了
Yo, we're finished packing the car.

599
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,259
你想出来告别一下吗 还是
You want to come out and say goodbye or...?

600
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,528
哦 当然 马上就看完了
Oh, well, yeah, this is almost over.

601
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:50,530
我们马上就走了
No, like, we're leaving.

602
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:52,532
- 哦 她要走吗  - 要去大学啊 记得吗
- Oh. She's leaving?  - Like, to go to college, you know?

603
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,133
- 哦哦 抱歉  - 是啊 四年呢
- Oh, oh, my bad.  - Yeah, four years, so...

604
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,002
- 好吧  - 走吧
- Oh, all right. - Let's go.

605
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,372
别看了 赶紧走
Nope, like... Go. Come on.

606
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:00,306
别为我担心 好吗
Uh, don't worry about me, okay?

607
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,576
要到伤感的时刻了
This is really hard right now.

608
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,877
你看起来不太好
You don't seem fine.

609
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,913
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

611
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,419
我爱你
I love you.

612
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:13,420
好了
Uh, okay.

614
00:22:15,087 --> 00:22:17,857
你是我生命中的光
You're the light of my life.

615
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,426
克莱尔:哦
CLAIRE:Oh. 

616
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:20,427
好啦
Okay. 

618
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:25,298
帮忙装行李可真是谢谢你
Thanks for helping us pack the car.

619
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,265
斯科特:对不起
SCOTT:I'm sorry.

620
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:28,968
我不知道你们已经装好了
I didn't realize you guys were done already.

621
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:31,605
对妈妈好点儿
Be nice to Mom.

622
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:34,173
还有一定要回我短信
And please respond to my texts.

623
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:36,008
我会的 不用担心
I will. Don't worry about it.

624
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:39,812
我 呃 回头我会去找你的
And, um... I-I'll come visit you at some point.

626
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,015
好啊
Okay. All right.

627
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:44,250
嗯
Yeah.

628
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,285
- 我爱你  - 我也爱你
- I love you.  - I love you, too.

630
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,122
- 玛姬:展翅高飞吧孩子
- MARGIE: Fly.

637
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:14,614
斯科特:嘿
SCOTT:Hey.

638
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,916
嘿
Hey.

639
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,618
呃
Uh...

640
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,655
我想着我还是要看看那个权力的游戏
I was thinking of finally seeing that Game of Thrones.

641
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,657
我是不是应该沉溺进去
Should I binge it?

642
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,224
哦 那个剧 挺 挺暴力的
Oh, it's a, it's a pretty violent show.

643
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:27,126
你确定要看吗
You sure you could watch that?

644
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:29,596
我在急诊工作
I work in an emergency room.

645
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:30,597
哦对
Right, yeah.

646
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,433
那你看烧杀抢掠啥的应该没问题
So, you could probably handle a good pillage.

647
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:34,368
是啊
Yeah.

648
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:37,269
好 那我就准备看了
Okay, well, maybe I'll start watching it.

649
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:38,538
- 好的  - 你跟我一起吗
- Yeah.  - You watch it with me?

650
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:43,109
呃 其实我 差不多看完了 所以
Um, well, I actually just kind of finished it, so I-I don't...

651
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:45,612
剧情还在我脑中盘旋 所以我可能
It's really fresh in my mind, so I-I would probably...

652
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:46,813
- 好吧  - 我可以看一部分
- Okay.  - I can watch some of them.

653
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,683
我觉得我可能不能全看一遍了 但
Uh, I don't think I can watch all of them again, but...

654
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:51,518
- 嗯  - 那就待会儿见了
- Well...  - I'll see you later, then.

655
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,520
好吧
All right.

656
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,522
你还好吗
Uh, are you okay?

657
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:58,525
还是
Or... 

658
00:23:58,558 --> 00:23:59,659
怎么了
Oh. Yeah?

659
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:00,660
过来
Come on.

660
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,462
没 没
Uh, it's, it-it's...

661
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:04,029
没事的
It's okay. It's...

662
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,198
我在这儿 我在
I-I'm here. Uh, I'm here.

663
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:08,502
别 别难过了
Don't-don't worry about it.

664
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:09,369
你知道 她
She's, you know...

665
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:11,538
她离咱们只有45分钟车程的
Well, she's only, like, 45 minutes away,

666
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,007
她肯定 过个五分钟就会打来电话的
and she'll-she'll probably call in, like, five minutes.

667
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:17,544
但是
But, hey.

668
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:20,079
你不是还有我呢吗 对吧
You still got me, right?

669
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,082
对
Yeah.

670
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,154
哦 草
Oh, shit.

671
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:30,189
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey!

672
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:34,126
奥斯卡:看 你应该这样拿
OSCAR: See, you got to hold it like this.

673
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,729
塔拉:我看看 噢
TARA:Let's see. Oh.

674
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:38,330
- 哦耶  - 哦
- Oh, yeah!  - Oh!

675
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:40,734
嘿 嘿 等下 兄弟们
Hey, hey, wait. Hey, hey, guys.

676
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,736
是这样
Look, look.

677
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:44,103
你们不能在这儿呆着
You can't be here, man.

678
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,572
- 你们得离开  - 凯尔西:为什么
- Y-You got to go.  - KELSEY: Why?

679
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:48,107
保安:这是私人土地 这就是为什么
GUARD: It's private property, that's why.

680
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,309
这是个废弃的孤儿院 我们怎么不能呆了
It's an abandoned orphanage. Why can't we be here?

681
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:51,678
里奇:谁鸟你啊 兄弟
RICHIE:Who gives a shit, man?

682
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,813
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

683
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:54,448
你在守着孤儿们的鬼魂儿吗
You fucking protecting the ghosts of dead orphans?

684
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:57,451
听着 胖坎耶 闭上你的臭嘴
Look, fat Kanye, shut your damn mouth.

685
00:24:57,484 --> 00:25:00,152
我五分钟候再他妈过来
I'll be back in five minutes for you assholes.

686
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:02,321
如果你们还在这儿 我就报警 没商量
If you're still here, I'm calling the cops, period.

687
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,491
你最好报警 哥们儿 因为你是个假警察
You better get the cops, man, 'cause you're a fake cop.

688
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,359
- 你需要真警察  - 保安:小王八羔子
- You need the real ones.  - GUARD: Motherfuckers.

689
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:08,595
- 操你们娘的  - 伊果:我有点后悔
- Fuck all of y'all.  - IGOR: I feel bad.

690
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,062
我们 是 是不是太过分了
We-we were a little too mean.

691
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:11,631
- 斯科特:是啊  - 他挺好的
- SCOTT: Yeah.  - He's nice.

692
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:12,833
是啊 他是个好人
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

693
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:17,471
那种人 他才是史泰登岛真正的问题
See, that guy... that is what is wrong with Staten Island.

694
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:20,640
别的镇上的人都不来我们这儿
We don't get any cool people from any of the other boroughs.

695
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:21,741
没人来
No one comes here.

696
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:24,210
我们只能跟这儿的土著混蛋们过一辈子了
We're stuck with the fucking pricks that live here.

697
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:26,011
你在骂我们
You're talking about us.

698
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:27,246
还当着我们的面
Right in front of us.

699
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,247
凯尔西:是啊 算是吧
KELSEY:Yeah, kinda.

700
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,683
我是想说 没人愿意来
I mean, no one comes here.

701
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,718
没有任何人员流动 那家伙 都有两百岁了吧
There's no flow of people. That guy's, like, 200.

702
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:33,185
咱们小时候就认识他
We've known him since we were six.

703
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:34,754
为什么咱们这儿不能像布鲁克林一样酷
Why can't we be cool like Brooklyn?

704
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:37,089
没有道理我们不能像布鲁克林一样酷啊
There's no reason we shouldn't be cool like Brooklyn.

705
00:25:37,122 --> 00:25:39,392
我们这儿景色美 离城市又近
We got amazing views. It's close to the city.

706
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:41,595
物价便宜 居民和蔼 真是没道理
It's cheap. Nice people. It makes no sense.

707
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:44,230
我们算是新泽西瞧不起的唯一的地方了
We're, like, the only place that New Jersey looks down on.

708
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:47,166
垃圾场得你从太空都能看见
You could see the garbage dump from space.

709
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,635
这地方也就这样了
This place is never gonna change.

710
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,336
不会的 肉类加工厂区不就改变了
No, it happened to the Meatpacking District,

711
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,270
还有那个村儿
the Village.

712
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:53,406
布鲁克林原来也是个操蛋的地方
Brooklyn used to be a fucking shithole.

713
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,273
咱们就是下一个了
We are next.

714
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,307
我要参加公务员考试
I'm gonna take my civil service test.

715
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:57,644
我要在城里工作 在城市规划部门
I'm gonna work in the city, in city planning.

716
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,779
你们看着吧 这地方即将成为下一个威廉斯堡
You watch, this place is gonna be like fucking Williamsburg

717
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:02,449
- 十年内建成  - 里奇:别 别介 我们可不想要
- in ten years.  - RICHIE: No, all right? No. Nobody wants that.

718
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:04,784
为什么你想在市里干城市规划的工作
Why do you want to work in the city and do city planning?

719
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:05,785
听着就无聊
That sounds so boring.

720
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,319
我觉得布鲁克林更好
I feel like Brooklyn is better.

721
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,054
我曾经跟一个住布鲁克林的人约过会
I dated a guy that lived in Brooklyn.

722
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:10,122
他是个调酒师
He was a mixologist.

723
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,692
他用牛奶做冰块
He made ice cubes out of milk.

724
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:14,794
- 他真是太有品味了  - 奥斯卡:闭嘴
- He was so classy.  - OSCAR: Shut up!

725
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:16,763
我爱史泰登岛
I love Staten Island.

726
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:17,731
这里好的没话说
It's amazing.

727
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,799
很快人们就将看到这一点 相信我
And people are gonna see it soon, trust me.

728
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,401
斯科特:你要是这么爱这里
SCOTT:Well, if you love it so much,

729
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:23,102
干嘛不让我把它文在你身上
why don't you let me tattoo it on you?

730
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:25,104
不 我可不会再让你给我文身了
No, I'm not gonna let you tattoo me again.

731
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:26,105
好吧
Fine.

732
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:29,174
那我也需要一个可以文的人
Well, I need somebody to tattoo.

733
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,544
我 我都没人可文了
I'm, I-I'm running out of...

734
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:32,144
里奇 你呢 兄弟
Come on, Rich. What about you, man?

735
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,213
- 别看我 哥们  - 为啥
- Don't even look at me, dude.  - Why?

736
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,148
你文的东西太丑了
Your work is mad inconsistent.

737
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:37,417
奥巴马文的不对
Obama ain't right.

738
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,818
斯科特:我只是把眼睛文错了 好吧
SCOTT:I got the eyes wrong, okay?

739
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:39,786
里奇:哪儿哪儿都不对
RICHIE:He's not right.

740
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,254
好嘛 这个文身伤到我了
All right, man, this has hurt me, all right?

741
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:43,623
我再也没有黑人朋友了
I don't have any black friends anymore.

742
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:45,592
我再也不能去理发店了
I can't go to a barber shop no more.

743
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:48,495
你把奥巴马文错了 没有比这严重的问题了
You got Obama wrong. Ain't nothing worse than that.

744
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:50,830
你呢 伊果 你要文条龙还是啥吗
What about you, Igor? You want a dragon or something?

745
00:26:50,864 --> 00:26:52,532
哦 我可真喜欢你的文身
Oh, I love your tattoos.

746
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:53,667
我弟弟
My brother?

747
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,834
太像了
It's a spitting image.

748
00:26:54,868 --> 00:26:56,403
- 斯科特:是啊 是我的代表作之一  - 是我的最爱
- SCOTT: Yeah. It's one of the best. - It's my favorite.

749
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:57,837
不不不 这是我的最爱
No, no, no, no. This is my favorite.

750
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:58,939
哦 这个真的精彩
Oh, you killed that.

751
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:00,473
- 可不 眼睛上很下功夫了  - 只是
- Yeah, I really worked hard on the eyes.  - Just...

752
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:02,609
真是可爱 我喜欢那个菊花
He's so cute. I love his butthole.

753
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:04,544
它时刻提醒我我有个肚脐眼
It reminds me that I have a belly button.

754
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,513
- 我还是算了  - 那什么 我得走了
- So, I'm good.  - Yeah, I got to go.

755
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:09,549
看你上赶着送文身真是悲哀
Watching you beg to give tattoos is too sad.

756
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,818
吓死我了
And that's freaking me out.

757
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,720
斯科特:快完事儿了
SCOTT: We're almost done.

758
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:14,888
马上
Almost.

761
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:20,125
好了
All right.

762
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,728
- 大功告成  - 看起来很不错啊
- You're all done.  - That looks really good.

763
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:23,329
是啊 我是说
Yeah, I mean, I wish

764
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,197
我希望你能让我文点儿更酷的 但也可以了
you'd let me do something cooler, but yeah.

765
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,733
卧槽 好疼 太疼了吧
Oh, fuck no. That hurts so bad.

766
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:29,335
- 又一个傻帽文身  - 斯科特:是啊 但 但我喜欢那种疼痛感
- Another dumb tattoo.  - SCOTT: Yeah, but I-I like the pain.

767
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,538
疼痛才是文身的真谛
The-the pain is the whole point of getting tattoos.

768
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,238
难道你不喜欢那种 文身的时候
Don't you just love when you're getting tattooed,

769
00:27:33,272 --> 00:27:34,908
深入骨髓的痛 让你的神经颤动
and it hits the bone and pinches a nerve,

770
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:36,208
那就像
and you're like...

771
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,744
我对疼痛不感兴趣
I'm not a fan of the pain.

772
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,613
你不应该让他文你的 好吧
You shouldn't let him do it to you, all right?

773
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,447
他发挥不稳定
He's inconsistent.

774
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,582
奥斯卡:我觉得那个文身很傻
OSCAR:I think that tattoo's dumb.

775
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:44,684
那你们看见图案的时候就该告诉我
Y'all should've told me when you saw the design.

776
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:45,619
上面说:取关我
It says, "Unfollow me."

777
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,354
本来你粉丝也不多啊
You don't even have that many followers.

778
00:27:47,387 --> 00:27:49,489
卡拉关注我了
Carla follows me.

779
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:51,223
- 兄弟 她不是真人  - 奥斯卡:卡拉不是真人
- Bro, she's imaginary.  - OSCAR: Carla not real.

780
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:52,459
卡了不是真人 哥们儿
Carla's not real, dude.

781
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:54,494
里奇:要我们说多少遍啊
RICHIE: How many times do we have to say this?

782
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:56,529
斯科特:她不是真人
SCOTT: She's not real.


783
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:57,831
我讨厌这虫子
I hate bugs, dawg.

784
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:58,932
我是土匪
I'm a gangster!

785
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,367
斯科特:别 那是只蜜蜂 老兄
SCOTT:No, that's a bee, bro!

786
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,502
奥斯卡:那边有个孩子
OSCAR:There's a kid down there.

787
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,236
- 哟 小孩儿  - 哟
- Yo, kid! - Oh, yo.

788
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:06,205
- 哟 小孩儿 你好啊  - 哦草 那儿有个孩子
- Yo, kid, what's up?  - Oh, shit, there is a kid.

789

你在干什么
What are you doing?

790
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:09,476
你在海滩溜达吗 过来 上这儿来
You hanging out on the beach? Come here, come here.

791
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,778
别害羞 我们不会害你
Don't-don't be shy. No stranger danger here.

792
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:12,946
我不碰你
I'm not gonna touch you.

793
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:14,381
- 你好吗 小老弟  - 你在干什么
- What's up, pal?  - What are you doing?

794
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:15,548
我在找我朋友
I'm looking for my friend.

795
00:28:15,582 --> 00:28:16,950
我在找我朋友
"Looking for my friend."

796
00:28:16,983 --> 00:28:19,686
你想跟我们当朋友吗
You want to be friends with us?

797
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,688
我们是好人
We're the good guys, right?

798
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,956
- 你可以跟我们一起玩儿 小老弟  - 来吧
- You can hang out with us, pal.  - Come on.

Let me get some of that. Put it right there.

800
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:26,393
- (fists bump)

801
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:28,795

00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:38,565
- 允许   - 对我来说就够了
- Yes. - That's good enough for me.


842
00:29:38,598 --> 00:29:40,332
- 你们觉得呢   - 可以成为呈堂证供
- How about you guys? - Holds up in court.

Yo, he can't get consent. He's ten.


845
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,372
那么 别乱动好吗 这纹上了可就洗不掉了
Now, hold still, okay? 'Cause it is permanent.


846
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:48,908
伙计们 停下 快停下
Yo, guys. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

- Put your game face on. - Don't worry, dude.


848
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:53,480
这玩意也不过就是会跟你一辈子
This will just be on you for the rest of your life.


849
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:55,448
开始了
There you go.


850
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:57,016
- 看看这个坚强的小伙   - 好样的
- Look at you, tough guy. - There you go.


851
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,352
我不想纹了
I don't want to do it!


852
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,420
- 我不纹了   - 可是我得把这纹完了
- I don't wanna! - Well, I got to finish it.


853
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:01,688
- 现在只有一条线   - 冷静点 哥们
- Now there's just a line. - Calm down, man.


854
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:04,023
- 这会让你看上去很傻 坐回来 放轻松   - 冷静点
- You're gonna look stupid. Sit back down. Relax. - Calm down.


855
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,558
- 坐下 继续   - 放松

Goddamn it.


861
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,902
我他妈的还信了他了
I fucking believed in that kid, man.


862
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:19,639
刚开始看着挺坚强 下一秒就怂了
He seemed so tough at first, uh, but then immediately wasn't.


863
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,541
所以我才不跟千禧一代玩啊 哥们
That's why I don't fuck with millennials, dude.


864
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:24,744
我再说一遍 我们也是千禧一代
Again, we are the millennials.


865
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,746
他老这么说 但我都不知道他在说什么
He keeps saying that, but I don't know what that means.


866
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,916
我后悔跟你们交朋友了
I regret my friendship with you guys.




868
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,396

Yeah, hello. My name's Raymond Bishop.


869
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:45,698
这个是我儿子 哈罗德 跟人家问好 哈罗德
This is my son, Harold. Say hello, Harold.


870
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:46,933
对不起
I'm sorry.


871
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,868
这是怎么了
What's going on?


872
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,670
是这样 你儿子好像在树林那边
Well, it seems your son was down in the woods


873
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:52,839
给别人免费纹身 而我儿子上了他的当
giving out free tattoos, and my son was one of his victims.


874
00:30:52,872 --> 00:30:54,841
什么 我 我不太明白
What? Well, I-I don't understand.


875
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:57,610
你怎么知道是我儿子 你怎么找到这里的
How do you know it was my son? How'd you get this address?


876
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,979
我有我的办法 相信我 我有门路
I have my ways. Believe me, I have my ways.


877
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:00,947
你是警察吗
Are you a cop?


878
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,749
不 我是个消防员 行了吗 我玩命工作
No, I'm a fireman, okay? I work for a living.


879
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:04,083
看看这个 你能相信吗
Look at this. Do you believe this?


880
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:05,819
看这里 你看到这条线了吗
You see that there? See that line?


881
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:07,887
我不知道这是得烧掉还是怎么样
I don't know if you burn these off or what,


882
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:08,888
但这个必须得给我弄掉
but we're taking care of this


883
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:10,490
而且你得承担所有费用 你明白吗
and you're paying for it, you understand me?


884
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,859
- 我都不知道这是什么   - 斯考特
- I don't know what this is. - Scott! Oh.


885
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:14,661
我 我真的很抱歉
I am... I'm so sorry.


886
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:15,862
我 我
I-I-I...


887
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:18,097
我工作的医院有一台激光美容仪
There's an aesthetic laser at the hospital where I work,


888
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:20,066
可以把这个去干净了
and it can completely remove it.


889
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,501
呃 我能给你打折
Uh, I get a discount.


890
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:22,635
我 这钱我来付
I'm-I'm gonna pay for the whole thing.


891
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,838
我有点语无伦次了 我感到抱歉
I don't know what I'm saying. I'm... I feel terrible.


892
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:25,839
你应该抱歉
You should feel terrible!


893
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:26,773
看看这个
Look at that!


894
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:28,908
- 怎么了 哦妈的   - 啊 终于来了
- What's up? Oh, fuck. - Ah, there he is.


895
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:31,511
- 你给我滚过来   - 嘿 他跟我说他18岁了
- You get your ass out here! - Hey, he said he was 18.


896
00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:34,047
他看上去像4岁 你个傻逼 不好意思
He looks like he's four, you fucking moron! Sorry.


897
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,882
- 他同意了   - 他骗人
- He consented! - He's lying.


898
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,750
- 哈罗德 拜托   -他当然是在骗人
- Harold, come on! - Course he's lying!


899
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:40,119
你同意没有法律效力 他才9岁
You can't have consent! He's nine years old!


900
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:41,721
爸爸 咱们走吧 你这样我很尴尬
Dad, let's go. You're embarrassing me.


901
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:42,922
我们不走 好吗
We're not going anywhere, okay?


902
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:43,756
他还是个小孩
He's just a little kid!


903
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,691
你他妈的是哪根筋搭错了
What the fuck is wrong with you?!


904
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,693
呃 他在林子里乱窜
Uh, he was roaming around in the woods.


905
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:48,428
说想要个纹身 当时你在哪呢
He wanted a tattoo. W-Where were you?


906
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:50,063
我他妈的在工作
I was at fucking work!


907
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:51,030
- 去你的吧   - 你给我出来
- Fuck you! - Come out here!


908
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:52,632
我要是你 我现在就乖乖闭嘴
If I was you, I'd shut your fucking mouth,


909
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:53,766
要不然我现在就报警
because I can call the cops right now


910
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,767
你马上就得进局子
and have your ass thrown in jail.


911
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:56,936
- 我犯了什么法   - 你给孩子捅针眼了
- For what? - For sticking needles in a kid's arm,


912
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,937
你个瘾君子
you fucking dope!


913
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,906
他是你带大的吗 你教他什么了到底
Did you even raise him? Did you even raise him?


914
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,975
是这样 没必要报警
You know, there's no reason to call the cops.


915
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:05,011
这事我能处理 他我也能处理
I can handle this and I can also handle disciplining him.


916
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:07,080
切 明显你处理不了 要不然你儿子也不会年过中年
Well, clearly you can't or you wouldn't have a middle-aged son


917
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:10,583
还住在你家 到处给未成年人瞎纹身
still living at home, tattooing minors against their will!


918
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:12,051
是我让他纹的
I asked him to do it.


919
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:13,920
- 不是他的错   - 听见了吗 这才是个汉子
- It's not his fault. - That's right. That's my man.


920
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:16,122
去 车里待着 哈罗德 去
Go wait in the car. Harold, go on.


921
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:17,757
以后不许对我这么大声
And don't raise your voice at me, either.


922
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,725
回见了 哈罗德
Later, Harold.


923
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:20,827
谁要跟你再见 别忘了看路
Don't say goodbye to my kid. Look both ways.


924
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,695
- 两边都要看   - 回你房间
- Look both ways! - Go to your room.


925
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:23,796
- 我看了   - 怎么说话呢
- I am! - Watch your mouth.


926
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,599
顺便告诉你 我没有人到中年
For your information, I am not a middle-aged man.


927
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:29,168
我才24岁 现在我要回房间了
I'm a 24-year-old man, and I'm going to my room


928
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:30,870
因为我他妈的想回去了
'cause I fucking want to.


929
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:34,474
你在这房子带大的这玩意是人吗 哈
What kind of fucking animal are you raising in this house, huh?


930
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:35,708
发票我肯定会拿来
I'm bringing you the bill.


931
00:32:35,742 --> 00:32:36,943
我才不管花了多少钱 
I don't care what it costs, all right?


932
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:39,579
- 这他妈的算什么事啊   - 好的
- I mean, what the fuck is going on around here? - All right.


933
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:40,980
给我一天的时间 我给你预约激光
Just give me a day to arrange the laser.


934
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:42,749
行 另外 
All right. You know, you know something?


935
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:43,983
他爸爸在吗 爸爸在哪里
I-Is his father home? Where's his dad?


936
00:32:44,017 --> 00:32:45,919
我 我也不想对着你大喊大叫
I-I don't, I don't want to fucking yell at you.


937
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:47,921
他爸爸不在了
He's deceased.


938
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:50,757
哦
Oh.


939
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,458
呃 呃
Well, uh...


940
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,060
我 呃 很抱歉
I'm, uh, sorry for your loss.


941
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,528
我肯定如果他爸爸还在
I'm sure if he was still around,


942
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:56,763
他肯定也会同意的
he would agree with the fact that,


943
00:32:56,796 --> 00:32:59,565
就是 这钱还是应该你们来付
you know, you should still pay for it.


945
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,141
像漫画里面一样大的山羊胡
Comically huge mustache.


946
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:09,976
他是不是长这样
Is this what he looked like?


947
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,477
他就长这样
That's exactly what he looked like.


948
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:13,546
- 你看上去很害怕   - 是的
- You're scared of me. - Yeah.


949
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:14,781
唷 他 他 这没什么好笑的
Yo, he-he… And that's not funny.


950
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,616
他就这么冲进来 开始大喊大叫
He burst into the door, started screaming,


951
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:18,618
气得胡子乱飞乱跳
and his mustache was flapping all over the place.


952
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:20,620
- 乱飞乱跳   - 他看上去像强手棋的那个人
- Flapping. - He looked the Monopoly Man.


953
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,722
非常吓人
It was terrifying.


954
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:24,824
“注意看路
"Look both ways!




955
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:26,626
两边都得看”
Look both ways!"


956
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,127
- 简直神经   - 但我还是得说
- Fucking maniac. - But I will say,


957
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:31,764
在树林子里给小孩纹身可不算什么好主意
probably not a good idea to tattoo children in the woods.


958
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,666
- 那可不   - 你有可能会惹上麻烦的
- Yeah, probably. - You know, you could get in trouble.


959
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,234
- 是啊 有可能   - 你为什么要这样
- Yeah, you could. - Why did you do that?


960
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:36,102
我也不知道
I don't know.


961
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:37,236
我还以为不会有事的
I thought I would get away with it.


962
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,372
而且 我以为他 至少得15了吧
Plus, I thought he was, like, at least 15, you know?


963
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:40,974
- 哦真的吗   - 我 我第一个纹身是我
- Oh, really? - I got... Yeah, I got my first tattoo...


964
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:43,276
- 他到底多大了   - 9岁
- How old was he? - Nine.


965
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:44,510
你以为他15了
You thought he was 15?


966
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:46,713
- 是的 我简直   - 你是不是抽太多了
- Yeah, I'm fucking… - Maybe you've been smoking too much.


967
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:48,114
我可能就是蠢
I think I'm just stupid.


969
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,751
你得看看我妈最近
No, you should see my mom, though.


970
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,753
- 自从我妹妹走了以后就很奇怪   - 是吗
- It's so weird since my sister left. - Yeah.


971
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:55,221
她总是在哭 而且
She's just crying all the time and, like,


972
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:57,190
她总是想跟我聊天 跟我待着
she's trying to talk to me and hang out with me.


973
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,025
有一天 她让我陪她去逛商场
The other day, she asked me to go to Nordstrom Rack.


974
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:01,127
我差点就自刎了
I almost slit my throat.


975
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,128
那你去了吗
Did you go?


976
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,796
没有 我假装睡着了
No. I pretended to be asleep.


977
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,631
拜托 她 她可能就是想有个人陪陪她
Oh, come on, she… Maybe she needs company.


978
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:07,567
你妹妹走了以后她很孤单
She's lonely without your sister.


979
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,036
没错 她 她肯定会寂寞的
Yeah, she's-she's, she's gonna be lonely.


980
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:12,605
你是没看见她在我妹妹欢送派对上的样子
I mean, you should've seen her at my sister's send-off party.


981
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:14,774
就 就很奇怪
It was, it was really weird.


982
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:18,244
你们给你妹妹办欢送会了
There was a party?


983
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:19,278
是啊
Yeah.


984
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:20,847
为什么没邀请我
Why wasn't I invited?


985
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,149
邀请你去高中毕业派对
To a high school graduation party?


986
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:25,018
那 都有谁去了
Well, who was there?


987
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:27,186
就 就是
It was, you know, it was just


988
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,956
家人 之类的
family and... shit.


989
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:32,091
怎么 你不想让我和你家人在一块吗
What, you don't want me to be around your family?


990
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,659
从我十岁开始就认识他们了
I've known them since I was ten.


991
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:34,794
嗯 就是
Well, yeah, I just...


992
00:34:34,827 --> 00:34:36,963
我以为你不会感兴趣的
I didn't think it was something you would want to go to.


993
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:38,064
我错了
I'm-I'm sorry.


994
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,066
拜托 这也太扯淡了
Come on, that's fucked up.


995
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:41,868
怎么了 这怎么扯淡了
Why? Why is that fucked up?


996
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:45,838
因为我们 你懂的 我们不一般
Because we're, you know, doing something here.


997
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:47,273
我们 我们什么不一般了
We're... Are-are we doing something here?


998
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:48,375
我也不知道 我以为我们不一般
I don't know, we're starting a thing.


999
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,176
就是 咱俩睡也睡了 玩也玩了
I mean, we're having sex and we're hanging out a lot.


1000
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:52,311
- 就我以为   - 我以为咱俩就是
- I mean, it's… - I thought it was just, like,


1001
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:55,348
就是 没这么认真的关系
more, you know, casual than that.


1002
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:56,883
你懂吗
You know?


1003
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:03,656
那你是说 你生命中的重要时刻不希望我陪着你吗
Well, you don't want me to go to any, like, life events?


1004
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:06,325
生命 生命中的重要时刻是什么
Life... What's a life event?


1005
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,728
什么 我都不知道那什么意思
What does that what does that even mean?


1006
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:11,798
算了 随便吧
You know what? It's fine.


1007
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:13,066
- 怎么了   - 没事
- What? - No, it's fine.


1008
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,167

Come back.


1009
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,835

1010
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,837
等
Wai...


1011
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,373
- 你知道吗 你说的没错   - 什么
- You know what? You're right. - What?


1012
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:21,040
你这话什么意思 我从来都是错的
What are you talking about? I'm never right.


1013
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,942
不 这次你没错 我们就这样吧
No, you're right. We shouldn't do this anymore.


1014
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:24,877
我不想咱俩再这么继续下去了
I don't want to fucking do this anymore.


1015
00:35:24,911 --> 00:35:26,612
你说什么呢 我不明白
What are you talking about? I don't understand.


1016
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,314
这事就不对 是个小失误
It was all a mistake. It was a mistake.


1017
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:29,816
但没事 咱俩现在达成共识了
But it's fine. We're on the same page.


1018
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,184
咱们的关系跟以前一样
We'll go back to what it was before.


1019
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:33,353
我会像对奥斯卡和里奇那样对你
I'll treat you like I do Oscar and Richie.


1020
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:34,354
我不是这个意思
I-It's not even that.


1021
00:35:34,388 --> 00:35:36,022
就是 我还不知道我到底想要什么
It's just, like, I-I don't know what I want yet.


1022
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,090
我还在试着理清头绪
Like, I'm trying to figure my shit out.


1023
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:39,192
你说得对 你应该这样 好好整理整理
And you should. Please do. Figure your shit out.


1024
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:41,227
但以后我不会跟你上床了 好吗
But we're not gonna have sex anymore, okay?


1025
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,895
我得走了
I got to go.


1026
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:46,866
我应该请你跟我一起去的
I should've invited you to the party!


1027
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:48,935
我也不知道那是我人生的重要时刻
I didn't know it was a life event!


1029
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,739
我已经跟医院说好了 到时候直接付钱
I-I already arranged to, uh, pay directly at the hospital.


1030
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:55,842
但如果你想让我付你支票 你等我两分钟 好吗
But if you want a check, just give me two minutes, okay?


1031
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,844
不不不 我 我想付这个钱
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm-I'm... I-I want to pay.


1032
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,846
我来付 这钱我来付
I'm gonna pay for it. I'm gonna pay for it.


1033
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:00,813
不不不 我会付的
No, no, no. I'm gonna pay for it.


1034
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:02,715
而且我也 我会跟斯考特好好谈谈
And I'm, and I'm also gonna talk to Scott


1035
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,951
这事太过分了 简直疯了
because that was totally out of line, totally nuts.


1036
00:36:04,984 --> 00:36:06,752
对 我明白
Yeah, I-I understand that.


1037
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:09,922
但 听着 我就是想跟你道个歉
But, uh, look, I just wanted to apologize, okay?


1038
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:12,325
我 上次我有点失控了
I-I got a little out of control before, uh...


1039
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,862
我 我让愤怒冲昏了头脑
You know, I just, I let my anger get the best of me.


1040
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:18,097
破了当初下的决心
Broke my stupid resolution.


1041
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:19,999
天啊 还不是因为这样我的婚姻才破裂了
God knows it's what messed up my marriage,


1042
00:36:20,032 --> 00:36:22,168
我 我真的很想跟你道歉 可以吗
and I-I just really wanted to apologize, okay?


1043
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,703
我 我当时很烦躁
I mean, I was upset,


1044
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,872
但我不应该那样表达自己
but I-I shouldn't have conveyed it that way.


1045
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:26,873
你不用道歉
There's no need to apologize.


1046
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:28,841
是我的孩子先胡来的 这样不好
My kid's being a fucking lunatic. It's not cool.


1047
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,411
我 我也反应过激了 他没什么错
Oh, I... I overreacted. He's fine.


1048
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:33,246
不 这还只是冰山一角
No, it's the tip of the iceberg.


1049
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:36,416
害 孩子嘛 好多都这样
Ah, you know, lot of kids do stuff like this.


1050
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,017
嗯 孩子才不这样呢
Mm, kids don't do stuff like this.


1051
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,185
他就差没在树林子里
He did the second-worst thing


1052
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:41,154
那啥了你儿子了
you could do to a kid in the woods.


1054
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:47,126
不管怎么样吧 我之前不应该那样对你
Well, either way, I shouldn't have behaved the way I behaved.


1055
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,928
我真心向你道歉
So, I'm truly sorry.


1056
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,398
我接受你的道歉 这很好
Apology accepted. It's nice.


1057
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,166
这附近的人可不都这样
Don't get many of those around here.


1058
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,201
- 谢谢   - 哦 这样可能
- Thanks. - Oh, hey, this might seem


1059
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:57,036
有点突然 但是
a little crazy, but, uh...


1060
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,772
我能请你喝杯咖啡吗
can I take you out for a cup of coffee?


1061
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:03,075
斯考特给我纹了这个
So, Scott did this.


1062
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:05,379
哦 这是个可卡犬吗
Oh. Is that a cocker spaniel?


1063
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:08,181
不不 这是我女儿
No. No, that's my daughter.


1064
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:09,248

- Yeah, I just thought… - No, it's okay.


1067
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:12,486
- 我以为那是耳朵   - 没事
- I thought those were ears. - Um, it's okay.


1068
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,420
- 那是她的头发   - 是的 我明白了
- That's her hair. Okay, yep. - I know. I hear that.


1069
00:37:13,453 --> 00:37:17,757
斯考特16岁的时候有了他第一个纹身
Scott got his first tattoo when he was 16.


1070
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,459

1074
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,234
抽大麻的科米蛙
Kermit smoking a joint?


1075
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,802
天 我怎么不记得芝麻街里
Geez, I don't remember that episode


1076
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,070

I mean, I sent him to art school, but he quit.


1083
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:44,317
他 他没法集中 因为
He-he couldn't really focus 'cause...


1084
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:47,920
他有注意力缺失症 所以他
He also has ADD, so he...


1085
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:50,823
反正 他是个有注意力缺失症的纹身艺术家
Anyway, he's a tattoo artist with ADD.


1086
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,024

我们消防局里的所有人
All the guys down at the firehouse,


1088
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,127
他们都有纹身之类的

1089
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:57,196
我自己是没有纹过 但是
Personally, I never got one, though, you know.


1090
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,031
你知道 我也不是反对这个事
You know, not that I have anything against them.


1091
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,734
我就是 我总觉得我太怂了
I just, I just always felt I was too pasty.

I just... I-I don't want to be alone the rest of my life.

I don't want you to be alone, either.

1339
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,580
那这样就很烂了 就像是 就像是
That would suck, but, like, come on. This is, like...

1340
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,950
这很明显不是一个好的选择 对吧？
This is pretty obvious this is not a good choice, right?

1341
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,850

(sighs)

1342
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,250
我想一起吃个饭
I would like us to have dinner.

1343

这.... 这对我很重要
I... This is very, very important to me.

1344
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,520
我对这份感情十分认真
I am in a serious relationship...

1345
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,860
- 你十分认真？ - 和一个好人
- You're in a serious rela... - ...with a very nice man.

1346
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,560
那个人？得了吧
With that guy?! Come on!

1347
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,960
你不爱他的 对吧
Y-You don't love him, do you?

1348
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,960
你不会那么说吧... 你不会那么说的 对吧
You're not say... You're not, like, saying that, right?

1349
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,830
呃 我们还没说那个字
I-I... Well, we don't use that word yet.

1350
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,730
但是如果他对我说了 我想我应该也会说
But if he said it to me, I-I would say it back.

1351
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,400
噢天啊！上帝！
Oh, my God! Jesus!

1352

你还没长记性吗？！
Do you not learn?!

1353
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,570
你看看上次发生的事
Look what happened last time!

00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,010
- 你想再来一遍吗？- 好的 好吧？
- You want to do that again? - Okay. All right?

1355
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,840
这怎么样
How about this?

1356
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,810
我们一起去你工作的餐厅
How about we come by the restaurant

1357
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,550
吃一顿晚饭

你好吗 你好吗 你们还在戒酒吗
How are you? How are you? You guys still sober?

1504
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,160

(crowd cheering)

1505
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,260
- 投球真垃圾 投的真烂 - 你就那么干！
- Shitty throw. Shitty throw, though. - That's how you do it!

1506
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,330
好的 就这样 就这样
All right, there we go. There we go.

1507
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,230
跑啊 北鼻 跑啊
Let's go, baby, let's go.

00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:01,370
活灵活现

(women whooping, shouting)

1510
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,670
你觉着他们能拿下三色堇施平纳吗
Think we're gonna take these pansy Spinners tonight?

1511
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,970
哦 兄弟 我觉着拿不下施平纳
Oh, man, we can't take the Spinners,

1512
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,210
- 你也许就只需要关上它 - 嗯
- you might as well just shut it down. - Mm.

1513
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,280
我们需要结束它
We should just pack it in,

1514
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,380
把这些人送回小联盟
send these guys back to Single-A.

1515
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,680
我孩子小联盟的队伍可以给这些人
My kid's Little League team could give these guys

1516
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:14,480
争取些钱
a run for their money.

1517
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,820
这些人也都有工作
These guys are all on the job, too.

1518
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,690
这是老混蛋
The old ballbuster here...

1519
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,220
他是这里的老大哥
he's the senior man of the house.

1520
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,220
你叫我老大哥？
Did you call me a senior?

1521
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,830
你是这里唯一的秃子
You're the one who's bald.

1522
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,690
得了吧 Papa 我就是开个玩笑
Come on, Papa. I'm just fucking around.

1523
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,930
嘿 想吃热狗吗
Hey, you want a hot dog?

1524
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,630
噢 不 我有克罗恩病
Oh, no, I can't. I, uh, I have Crohn's.

1525
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:31,900
那是个啥
What's that?

1526
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,700
就是你的胃里全部都乱套了
It's, like, when the lining of your stomach is all messed up,

1527
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,170
让你一直都很难受
so it makes you shit all the time.

1528
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,110
哦 谢谢分享
Oh, thanks for sharing.

1529
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,240
下次你就只说“我不想要热狗”就行
Next time, just say, "I don't want a hot dog."

1530
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,150
好的 我只是想让大家了解一下
All right, I'm just trying to spread awareness.

1531
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,110

(crowd cheering)

1532
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,780
就这样 就这样
There we go. There we go.

1533
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,420
-打得漂亮 打得漂亮 - 看着真棒 伙计们
- Nice hit. Nice hit. - Looking good, guys.

1534
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,990
干的不错
Way to hustle.

1535
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,290
26号
Number 26...

1536
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,760
嘿 呃
Hey, uh...

1537
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,060
你有没有想过要穿上这身制服
you ever think about putting on the jacket?

1538
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:00,960
- 不 - 你笑的什么
- No. - What are you laughing about?

1539
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,200
这是个很傻的问题 Ray
'Cause it's a stupid question, Ray.

1540
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,400
- 你说傻什么意思 - 这他妈就是很傻
- What do you mean, stupid? - It's fucking stupid.

1541
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,900
如果你问那个在太空炸死的老师的孩子
Would you ask the kids of that teacher who blew up in space

1542
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,040
你想不想当个宇航员
if they want to be an astronaut?

1543
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:13,840
哇 我不觉着那个女士有孩子
Whoa, I don't think that lady had any kids, though.

1544
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,080
是啊 我也觉着她没有 她都死在天上了
Yeah, I'm sure she didn't 'cause she died in space.

1545
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,280
你要是死在天上就不太容易生个孩子
It's hard to have kids when you're dead in space.

1546
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,850
听着 我可以告诉你我对消防员的感觉
Look, I-I could tell you how I feel about firemen,

1547
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,390
但是 我觉着这些伙计不会想听我的意见
but I-I don't think you guys want to hear my opinion.

1548
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,320
- 不是的 请告诉我们 - 别 别 别这样
- No, no, no, please tell us. - No, no. No, no, no.

1549
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,690
- 别 我不想听 - 你不用非得那么干
- No. I want to hear it. - You don't got to do this, man.

1550
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,790
- 得了吧 - 行吧
- Come on. - All right, no.

1551
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,260
- 行 那这样怎么样 - 算了 你别
- Yeah. Okay, how about this? - Come on, you don't...

1552
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,290
嗯 如果你是个消防员 就别要孩子了
Uh, if you're a fireman, just don't have kids

1553
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,760
或者家庭也干脆别要 行吧？
or a family at all, okay?

1554
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,470
那样的话 当你他妈有一次回不了家的时候
So that way, you don't fucking crush them

1555
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,300
也不会让他们彻底崩溃 明白吗？
when you don't come home that one time, you know?

1556
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,800
你们就是太自私了
And-and you're just so selfish.

1557
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,370
你们成天就和你们的兄弟闲逛
You just hang out with your boys all day

1558
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,870
像他妈的兄弟会一样
like it's a fucking frat house.

1559
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,040
甚至一半的时间都没在灭火
Half the time, you're not even putting out fires.

1560
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,110
就只会打飞机 看疤面煞星 对吧？
You're just jerking off, watching <i>Scarface,</i> okay?

1561
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,110
- 行了 放松点 伙计 - 不 我就是那么说
- All right, take it easy, man. - No, I'm just saying.

1562
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,050
你告诉孩子你会一辈子
And it's wrong to tell a kid that you're gonna be there

1563
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,180
陪在他身边是不对的
for him for his whole entire life.

1564
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,420
嗯 然后你就会错过毕业典礼 错过生日 是吧
Yeah, but you miss graduation, your birthdays, okay?

1565
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,990
嗯 还有我的毕业舞会
Uh, my d... my prom dances.

1566
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,860
这对一个孩子来说太残忍了
That's a very mean thing to do to children.

1567
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,990
如果你有一个家庭
And, uh, if you have a family,

1568
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,330
- 那你就是个混蛋 - 不 听我说 不
- y-you're an asshole. - No, listen, no.

1569
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,330
放松 放松点
Take it easy, take it easy.

1570
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,730
- 这是一种方式看待他 - 对
- Well, that's one way to look at it. - Yeah.

1571
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,060
给我爸说去吧
Tell that to my dad.

1572
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:15,240
但是你不能 因为他死了
Oh, but you can't, 'cause he's dead.

1573
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,740
有人能帮我转达他吗
- Anybody got a good response to that?

1574
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,310
耶
Yeah!

1575
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,380
再来
Again!

1576
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,450
哇哦
Whoo!

1577
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,520
比赛太棒了 比赛太棒了
What a game. What a game.

1578
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,850
所以 我不该生孩子了？
So, what, I shouldn't have kids?

1579
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,790
不 你可以有孩子
No, you... you should have kids.

1580
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,950
我要生孩子
I'm gonna have kids.

1581
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,490
你知道 也许你该从你的T恤上
You know, maybe you should take a cue

1582
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,820
学一下 明白吗 微笑
from your shirt, you know? Smile.

1583
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,360
放轻松
Lighten up.

1584
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,260
实际上还挺搞笑
That's actually kind of funny.

1585
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,200
好的伙计们 为什么不能更像他一点
Guy's all right. Why can't you be more like him?

1586
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,130
他没事的
He's all right.

1587
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,030
为什么你要让我那么尴尬
Why can't you not embarrass me like this?

1588
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,200
对不起
I'm sorry.

1589
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,270
对不起我让你在你朋友面前丢人了
I'm sorry I embarrassed you in front of your friends.

1590
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,010

(laughs)

1591
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,840
继续坚持你的立场吧
And just-just stick to your guns.

1592
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,280
好吗？ 会好的
All right? It'll be fine.

1593
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,380
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey!

1594
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,410
进来吧
Come on in.

1595
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:01,080
和我们一块吃早饭
Come have breakfast with us.

1596
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,090
我做了薄烤饼 还做了你喜欢吃的香肠
I made pancakes, and I made the sausage that you like,

1597
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,990
还有煎蛋卷
an omelet.

1598
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,120
来吧 来吧 来坐下
Come, come, come, come sit.

1599
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,390
伙计 这鸡蛋配着
Man, these eggs are spectacular.

1600
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,460
洋葱和胡椒真的太赞了
With the onions and the peppers.

1
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:13,367
太好吃了 太好吃了
I love it. I love it.

2
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,437
他这是 在这里呆了一晚上吗
Did, uh, did he sp-spend the night?

3
00:55:17,471 --> 00:55:19,205
对 是的
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:20,540
他昨晚睡在这里
He slept here.

5
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:21,541
在这屋里
In this house.

6
00:55:21,575 --> 00:55:23,443
我已经成年了哦 这没什么问题
I'm an adult. I can do that.

7
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:28,047
有些事情我想和你谈一谈
I-I need to talk to you about something.

8
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,148
好的
Okay.

9
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:31,017
我觉得 你现在是时候
I was thinking that it's time

10
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,152
去找一间属于你自己的公寓了
to think about getting your own apartment.

11
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:34,554
什么
What?

12
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,456
你为什么这么说
W-Why would you say that?

13
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,257
是这样的
Well...

14
00:55:39,992 --> 00:55:41,461
你呢 是个很棒的孩子
You are so awesome.

15
00:55:41,495 --> 00:55:45,465
而我呢 有时候可能有点过分关照你了
And I think I've been there for you too much.

16
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:48,602
人嘛 往往只有在失去安全感的时候
'Cause sometimes in life, the thing that's motivating

17
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:51,137
才能激发他的潜能
is when people don't have that safety net.

18
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,039
话是没错 但我现在正需要这份安全感
Right, right, but I need that safety net

19
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:54,307
我还没准备好呢
'cause I don't have my shit together.

20
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,376
为什么 你早不提完不提 偏偏现在提
So, like, uh, w-why are you doing this?

21
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,943
是因为他吗
Is this 'cause of him?

22
00:55:58,612 --> 00:56:00,212
不
No.

23
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:03,082
你看你也二十四岁了
It's just you're 24 years old now.

24
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:06,952
二十四啊 菲尔普斯二十四的时候都好几块金牌了
24. I mean, Phelps had a fistful of gold medals by 24.

25
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:08,954
你插什么嘴
Why are you talking?

26
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,257
我也就是给些参考 没别的意思
I'm just giving you some perspective, that's all.

27
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,060
你看啊 格雷茨基二十四岁的时候 已经打进了九十六球
You know, Wayne Gretzky had, like, 96 goals when he was 24.

28
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:15,961
啥
W-What?

29
00:56:15,995 --> 00:56:18,097
罗杰 斯陶巴 现实毕业于西点军校
Roger Staubach graduated West Point,

30
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,267
然后赢得了海斯曼奖 再参加了越南战争
won a Heisman Trophy, fought in the Vietnam War,

31
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,537
回来后加盟了达拉斯牛仔 那时他也就二十四岁 
and then joined the Cowboys by the time he was 24.

32
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:27,039
这都是些什么人 关我屁事啊
I don't know who that is, so, s-so who-who gives a fuck?

33
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:29,376
我觉得 你应该可以的
I think that maybe you're-you're ready

34
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:31,378
只是你自己不自觉
and you just don't even know it.

35
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:33,647
所以你是要把我赶出去咯
So, you're kicking me out?

36
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,781
不 不是的
No, no.

37
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,384
我只是希望 你可以在明年夏天前 找好自己的公寓
I just want you to get your own apartment by summer.

38
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,586
好的 所以说就是把我赶出去咯
Right, so you're kicking me out of the house.

39
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:41,421
有整整九个月的时间呢
That's nine months from now.

40
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:43,623
你看啊 九个月你如果动作快一点孩子都有了
I mean, you-you could have a baby in nine months.

41
00:56:43,657 --> 00:56:44,691
时间还多着呢
It's a long time.

42
00:56:44,725 --> 00:56:46,626
你是要搬进来吗 所以先要把我挤出去吗
Are you moving in? Are you trying to push me out?

43
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,095
我到底是做了什么 我以为我们俩关系还行
What, like, what did I do? I-I thought we were cool.

44
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:51,097
Scott 大家都是成年人了 要互相体谅
Scott, Scott, let's all be adults here. Come on.

45
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,467
你妈妈已经以努力了很久了
Your mother has worked very hard for a very long time.

46
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,234
我呢过几年也要退休了
And I'm gonna retire in a couple years,

47
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:59,171
所以生活呢会发生一些变化 当然了这都是往好的方向在转变
so things are gonna change around here, but in a good way.

48
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,441
我们相信 你可以自己干出一番成就的
I mean, w-we think you... that you can do great things.

49
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,109
对对对 我知道我会赶出一番成就
Yeah, I know I'm gonna do great things.

50
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:05,645
但这不需要你来提醒我 而且啊
But, like, I don't need you to tell me that, like...

51
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:07,213
这到底是怎么回事
This is... What's going on?

52
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:09,115
我怎么了我
This is... I-I...

53
00:57:09,148 --> 00:57:10,617
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

54
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,452
别太在意 就目前来说
So, be that as it may,

55
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:14,621
直到你搬出去前 当然了搬出去对你是一件好事
until you leave... which is gonna be good for you

56
00:57:14,654 --> 00:57:15,988
可以帮助你更积极地面对生活
and it's gonna be motivating...

57
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:17,457
搬出去前 你需要帮忙干点活儿
you're gonna have to pull your weight

58
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:18,692
不多不多 就一点儿
a little more around here.

59
00:57:18,725 --> 00:57:22,094
比方说 有件事情 我们就觉得你一定能胜任
And one thing that we thought would help you contribute...

60
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:24,398
对你来说举手之劳 一点都不难
would be easy, wouldn't be hard to do...

61
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:28,000
我们觉得 当Ray需要工作 没有时间的时候
is to help Ray bring his kids back and forth to school

62
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:31,003
你可以去帮Ray接孩子上下学
when he can't do it because of work.

63
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:33,005
比如现在
Like now.

64
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:34,474
今天开始
Like today.

65
00:57:34,508 --> 00:57:36,075


66
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:38,277
你们在逗我吧
You're joking, right?

67
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,347
你要我帮你接孩子?
You want me to take your kid to school?

68
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,215
就是我给纹身的那个?
The kid that I tattooed?

69
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:46,420
我有两个孩子 另一个现在七岁
I got two kids. The other one's seven.

70
00:57:46,453 --> 00:57:48,455
你要让我帮你带孩子啊
You're gonna make me babysit your kids?

71
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:51,223
这... 我嗑药的哦
Do... I'm on... I do drugs.

72
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:54,059
没事 我看你现在很清醒啊
Well, looks like you're walking.

73
00:57:54,093 --> 00:57:56,061
谢谢
And thank you.

74
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:59,064
我现在可是一肚子意见啊听到没有
I'm not cool with any of this, okay?

75
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:01,033
况且 你们要我搬哪里去
And-and where do you expect me to live?

76
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:02,334
我拿什么钱去找地方
And w-with what money?

77
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:04,236
你知道我还在啃老的不是吗
You know I'm a fucking bum, right?

78
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,373
都什么乱七八糟的 卧槽
Yo, this is fucked up! Seriously.

79
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:10,943
尤其是昨天晚上 还搞什么交流感情
Especially after last night, all that bonding boy bullshit.

80
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:12,646
你真的是满嘴跑火车
You're full of shit, man.

81
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,614
就是一个骗子
You're a fucking liar.

82
00:58:14,648 --> 00:58:17,349
那么 我现在就去帮你接孩子
I'm gonna go walk your kids.

83
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:19,753
接个屁 你想也不要想
No, I'm not fucking letting you take 'em.

84
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:22,121
你谁啊你 就来接孩子
Fuck you. Who the fuck are you?

85
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:23,723
你可说得太对了
Yeah, I-I agree with you completely.

86
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:25,358
我来接孩子 这都是Ray出的主意
Why... 'cause that... It was Ray's idea.

87
00:58:25,392 --> 00:58:27,059
我也觉得我来接很不妥当 真的
I don't think I should be taking them, either.

88
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:28,294
你说得对
I agree with you.

89
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,198
你是傻逼吗
Are you a weirdo?

90
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:33,600
哈 可傻逼了
Oh, the weirdest.

91
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:35,201
谁能傻得过我呀
Nobody's weirder than me.

92
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:37,604
得了吧 傻逼哪会承认自己是傻逼
See, a weirdo wouldn't say that.

93
00:58:37,637 --> 00:58:39,606
傻逼都说自己不傻逼
A weirdo would deny it.

94
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:43,008
那么 我是接还是不接呢
So, do I have to take 'em or...?

95
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:45,445


96
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:46,480
接
Yes.

97
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:48,415
妈呀
God, no.

98
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,484
那怎么办 本来应该是Ray干的活
I mean, Ray was supposed to do it.

99
00:58:50,517 --> 00:58:51,384
我也没办法
I can't fucking do it.

100
00:58:51,418 --> 00:58:53,487
还有半个小时就上课了
Their schools start half an hour apart

101
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,054
去学校还要横跨整个小镇呢
on the other side of town.

102
00:58:55,087 --> 00:58:57,022


103
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:02,629
我说 你妈勾搭了我前夫是吧
So, your mom is banging my ex?

104
00:59:02,662 --> 00:59:05,097
对 而且我也不是很开心
Yeah, I'm not thrilled about it, either.

105
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,634
那是 你开心的起来就邪乎了
Yeah, well, you shouldn't be.

106
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:09,769
Harold. Kelly.

110
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:17,444

Oh, hey, man.

111
00:59:17,477 --> 00:59:20,714
这个是Harold 这个是Kelly
So, this is Harold, and this is Kelly.

112
00:59:20,747 --> 00:59:23,416

And, uh, this is...

113
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,819

114
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:28,120
好的Scott 接下来他送你们去学校
Scott. He's gonna be taking care of you.

115
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:30,256
- 听到了吗   - 你好啊 Scott
- Okay?   - It... - Nice to meet you, Scott.

116
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:32,559
你好啊 Harold 第一次见面吧
Hi, Harold. It's nice to meet you.

117
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:34,260
真高兴认识你
For the very first time.

118
00:59:34,293 --> 00:59:36,128
如果他做了什么奇怪的事情
If he does anything weird,

119
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:37,196
你们就告诉我
you tell me.

120
00:59:37,229 --> 00:59:40,400
就算他让你们不要说 你们也告诉我
Even if he tells you not to tell me, you tell me.

121
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:44,571
我觉得这人应该挺正常的 但也不是没可能看走眼
I'm pretty sure he's not weird, but I could be wrong.

122
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:45,639
明白了吗
'Kay?

123
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:46,740
- 爱你们哦   - 好的
- Love you. - Okay.

124
00:59:46,773 --> 00:59:47,807
- 爱你 妈妈   - 我可没开玩笑
- Love you, Mom. - Seriously.

125
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:49,409
爱你 妈妈 拜拜
Love you, Mom. Bye.

126
00:59:49,442 --> 00:59:50,544
小心了
Pay attention.

127
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,812
明白
Got it.

128
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:55,180
拉好手 两个人的都拉好
Hold both their hands!

129
00:59:58,385 --> 01:00:00,319
谢谢你了
Thank you.

130
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:02,489
看汽车 先看左边 再看右边啊
Look both ways. Look both ways!

131
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:04,691
让他别吵
Tell her to stop.

132
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:07,226
妈呀
God!

133
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:09,295
Harold 你平时喜欢什么呀
So, w-what do you like to do, Harold?

134
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:11,698
我喜欢超级英雄
I like superheroes.

135
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:13,633
哈 谁不喜欢呢
Well, so does everybody.

136
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,535
我喜欢自己想出来的
No, I make up my own.

137
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,437
这样啊 什么样的英雄呀
Oh, yeah? What kind?

138
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,738
闪冰侠
Ice Flash.

139
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:21,106
他能干什么呢
What does he do?

140
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,478
他能把东西冻住 还能向别人射出冰块
He freezes stuff and shoots ice at people.

141
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,481
哦 听着不是很厉害呀
Oh, well, that's not gonna work.

142
01:00:28,515 --> 01:00:29,516
为什么
Why not?

143
01:00:29,549 --> 01:00:31,451
我那个电吹风就能锤爆他了
I could just use a hair dryer and ruin him.

144
01:00:31,484 --> 01:00:33,218
不过想法不错 再接再厉
Keep thinking, though.

145
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:35,220
你呢 你平时都喜欢干什么呀

156
01:00:59,379 --> 01:01:00,346
她唱歌可好了
She's a good singer.

157
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,849
这首歌的歌词我持保留意见
I don't agree with the sentiment of the song,

158
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,484
但唱得真不错
but it was really great.

159
01:01:04,517 --> 01:01:07,754
就这样 在学校一天开心哦

Uh... I hope it's not shitty,

161
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:13,325
还有 给你妹妹 一个吻别吧
and, um, yeah, give your, uh, sister a kiss goodbye.

162
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,195
- 我们从不搞这个   - 你吻就是了
- We don't do that. - Just do it.

163
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,635
怎么样 感觉不错吧
See? Wasn't that nice? 

164
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:23,770
如果她明天就挂了 那你至少你会记得
Now, if she dies tomorrow, you'll remember that,

165
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:25,237
你吻别过你妹妹了
that you kissed her goodbye.

166
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:26,806
上学愉快哦
Have a good day at school.

167
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,409
- 拜拜   - 小心点
- Later, man. - Pay attention.

168
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:31,678
- 我明天怎么就挂了呢  - 不知道
- Why would I die? - I don't know.

169
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:33,413
这种事情你永远都说不准
You never know what's gonna happen.

170
01:01:33,446 --> 01:01:35,382
你觉得自己是不死之身吗
Think you're immortal?

171
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,886
这里 就是这间
This. It's this one.

172
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:41,888
好的 
Okay. All right.

173
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:43,790


174
01:01:43,823 --> 01:01:45,792
那么 在学校玩得开心哦
Well, have a good day, okay?

175
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:47,527
- 好的   - 放学再见 大概吧
- Okay. - I'll see you soon, I guess.

176
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,796
- 请问需要什么帮助吗   - 呕 你好啊
- Can-can I help you? - Oh, hi.

177
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,263
我是Ray的朋友
I'm-I'm Ray's friend.

178
01:01:51,296 --> 01:01:53,566
我就是来送她上学的
I was just here to bring her here.

179
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:57,370
- 你认识Ray吗   - 大概算认识吧
- You-you know Ray? - I know Ray a little bit.

180
01:01:57,404 --> 01:01:59,606
他最近在勾搭我妈妈
He's kind of, like, banging my mom.

181
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:01,340
所以 你懂的 嗯
So, yeah, I'm just, you know,

182
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:02,375
我就把她送过来了
just dropping her off.

183
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:04,377
你再办公室那边登记过吗
Did you sign in at the office?

184
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:06,579
没有 我都不知道还有办公室
No. I didn't even know you had an office.

185
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:08,615
好吧
Okay, um...

186
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:09,949
Kelly 你有什么问题吗
Kelly? You okay?

187
01:02:09,983 --> 01:02:11,418
没有
Yeah.

188
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,819
- 你确定吗   - 确定
- You sure? - Yeah.

189
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:14,554
如果有的话你可以告诉我哦
You know you can tell me.

190
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:16,321
我没事
I'm okay.

191
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:17,757
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

192
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:18,825
算认识吧
Yeah, kind of.

193
01:02:18,858 --> 01:02:20,860
是个新朋友
He's a new friend.

194
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:22,729
好的
Okay.

195
01:02:22,762 --> 01:02:24,798
哈 我在车里教她教得可好了 才不会招供呢
Oh, I trained her in the car. She's not gonna break.

196
01:02:24,831 --> 01:02:26,366
开玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

197
01:02:26,399 --> 01:02:27,967
我是不会伤害她的
It's, uh... I'm not gonna hurt her.

198
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:29,636
那么 祝一天愉快 我这就...
Um, but have a great day. I just...

199
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:32,405
那个 等等 能不能帮忙把画都摆好
No, uh, actually, could you, uh, set up the paints?

200
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:33,673
- 不   - 来 来 来
- No. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,274
- 还有这些刷子   - 不
- Uh, and just wash these brushes. - No.

202
01:02:35,307 --> 01:02:36,443
- 谢谢你啦   - 不 不
- Thank you so much. - No. No.

203
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:38,511
- 谢谢   - 不
- Thank you! - No.

204
01:02:38,545 --> 01:02:40,714


205
01:02:45,351 --> 01:02:47,219


206
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:58,631
不好意思 请问您有没有看过
Did-did you happen to get a chance

207
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:01,333
- 我给你的那个   - 哦 看过你的本子了
- to take a look at the, uh... - Yeah, I looked at your book.

208
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:04,471
我以前也这么干过 大概十四岁的时候吧
I mean, I drew like that, too, when I was 14.

209
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:07,006
从你的本子来看 你还缺少一些基本的东西
From what I saw, you don't really have the basics,

210
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,942
你得再练练
so you got to figure that out.

211
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:10,443
嗯 所以我才来这里的
Well, yeah, that's why I'm here.

212
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:12,645
我希望可以从你这里学纹身
I mean, I was hoping I can learn from you.

213
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:15,280
那么 你就是要做我的学徒咯
Right, well, um, you'd be my apprentice.

214
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:16,549
你在店里会和一个奴隶一样
Uh, you'll be a slave to the shop.

215
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,419
- 没事的 只要我最后可以给被人纹身   - 不行
- Hey, man. As long as I get to tattoo people, right? - No.

216
01:03:19,452 --> 01:03:21,821
在我允许你纹身之前 不行
Never. Until I say.

217
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,491
你要做的是给针消毒 给我洗车
Uh, you'll be sterilizing needles, washing my car,

218
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:25,625
帮店里扔垃圾
taking the trash out.

219
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:27,427
基本上 就是个店里的佣人
I mean, you're basically our bitch.

220
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,294
那么 在这里打工能挣 大概多少钱呢
So, how much will I be, like, making here?

221
01:03:29,328 --> 01:03:31,064
- 挣个鸡巴   - 鸡巴
- Dick. - Dick.

222
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:32,599
好吧
Okay, well...

223
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:35,034
有很多人想要这份工作呢 老兄
It's a long line of people who want this job, man.

224
01:03:35,068 --> 01:03:37,504
那我怎么付房租啊
How do I, like, pay my rent?

225
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:41,574
这就不是我要关心的问题了
That one right there is not my problem.

226
01:03:41,608 --> 01:03:43,042
你第一天来这里 已经开始抱怨了是吧
It's your first day, you're already complaining.

227
01:03:43,076 --> 01:03:44,343
很奇怪 不是吗
It's kind of weird, huh?

228
01:03:44,377 --> 01:03:46,012
不然还是算了吧
Yeah, let's not do this.

229
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:48,081
你还是出去走走吧
You should take a walk.

230
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:50,683
- 每种   - 好吧
- Pussy. - All right.

231
01:03:50,717 --> 01:03:52,852
那我能问个问题吗
Well, could I ask you a question?

232
01:03:52,886 --> 01:03:54,319
假设我在这里工作
If I did work here?

233
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:55,522
他怎么还在这里
Why is he still here?

234
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:57,056
比如说吧 有个傻帽来到店里
Let's say some idiot walks in, right?

235
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,392
他想要纹一个死神在身上 而这个死神呢
And he wants to get a tattoo of a Confederate flag

236
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:00,460
还披着美国国旗
wrapped around the Grim Reaper.

237
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:02,529
你可以让那个傻帽滚蛋的是吧
You could tell that guy to go fuck himself, right?

238
01:04:02,562 --> 01:04:04,030
毕竟这么一个纹身实在是太二了
'Cause that's a ridiculous tattoo to ask for.

239
01:04:04,063 --> 01:04:06,933
我不会去评价别人想纹的图案
It's not my place to judge people, man.

240
01:04:06,966 --> 01:04:08,134
这不是我该干的事情
I don't do that.

241
01:04:08,168 --> 01:04:10,603
那如果来了另一个人呢 他走了进来
Well, what if another guy walked in and he wanted to get

242
01:04:10,637 --> 01:04:12,372
想要把他死去的朋友James纹在胸口
a tattoo of his dead friend James on his chest, right?

243
01:04:12,405 --> 01:04:13,840
但是你知道那个James
But you know James, and you don't want

244
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:15,842
你不想纹这个图案 因为你知道
to give him the tattoo, 'cause you know James

245
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:17,410
James是个混账 世界上少了他
and he's an asshole and that the world's

246
01:04:17,443 --> 01:04:18,411
才算清净呢
better off without him.

247
01:04:18,444 --> 01:04:19,946
- 那你该怎么办   - 你找死吗
- What do you do then? - You have a death wish?

248
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:20,814
不 我不想找死
No, I don't have a death wish.

249
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:22,816
但那位摩托车上的女士有点那意思
But that lady on the motorcycle does.

250
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:24,450
她连内裤都没穿一条
She's not even wearing any underwear.

251
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:26,052
- 下面可是会烧焦的啊   - 你欠揍是吧
- She's gonna burn her pussy. - Do you want to do this?

252
01:04:26,085 --> 01:04:27,420
欠揍就来啊 我来揍你
You really want to fucking do this?

253
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:28,320
不不不 我不想挨揍
I don't want to do anything with you.

254
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:29,556
我只想知道James是怎么死的
I just want to know who killed James.

255
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:30,690
是那个披着国旗的家伙干的吗
Was it the Confederate flag man?

256
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:31,958
还是骑摩托的小姐姐干的
Was it the motorcycle lady?

257
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:35,528
说实话 Kelsey 你和照片上真的是一模一样
I got to be honest, Kelsey, you look exactly like your picture.

258
01:04:35,562 --> 01:04:38,097
不过更加丰满一些 更劲爆
You're kind of thicker, more robust.

259
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:39,599
哈哈哈 谢谢
Oh, thank you.

260
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:40,600
- 真的   - 瞧你夸的
- Yeah. - It's a compliment.

261
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:43,970
你看着有点像 安东尼奥 班德拉斯
You look a little bit like Antonio Banderas,

262
01:04:44,003 --> 01:04:45,138
不过我先得把眼睛眯起来看
if I squint really hard.

263
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,539
哈哈 那你就眯着吧
Oh, please squint all night long.

264
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:47,740
别睁开了
That's great.

265
01:04:47,774 --> 01:04:49,576
真的Chelsea... 不好意思 我是说Kelsey
Chelsea, you are... I mean, Kelsey, I'm sorry.

266
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:50,944
- 没事没事 正常   - 你不介意就好
- Th-That's all right. It's only... - Yeah, you know.

267
01:04:50,977 --> 01:04:51,744
你叫什么来着
What's your name again?

268
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:52,979
- 我已经忘了   - 我叫Jake
- I forgot already. - Um, it's Jake.

269
01:04:53,012 --> 01:04:53,980
实在是不好意思
Sorry about that.

270
01:04:54,013 --> 01:04:54,948
你是做什么的呀
So, uh, w-what do you do?

271
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:56,716
我在学习如何在城市中工作
Oh, I'm studying to work in the city.

272
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:57,884
- 哦   - 我想可以
- JAKE: Oh. - Um, I want to make

273
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,720
让史坦顿岛重新成为一个好地方
Staten Island, like, a great place again.

274
01:05:00,753 --> 01:05:03,590
这个岛已经很不错啦 为什么要这么做呢
Staten Island's already cool. What are you talking about?

275
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:04,858
是呀
Yeah, it is.

276
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:07,060
- 真的挺不错了   - 你是我见过第一个这么说的人
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. - You're the first person here to say that.

277
01:05:07,093 --> 01:05:08,695
不不不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

278
01:05:08,728 --> 01:05:09,662
这可是这个星球上最好的地方了
It's the best place on Earth.

279
01:05:09,696 --> 01:05:11,865
至少在东海岸 是一个不错的地方吧
Well, at least on the East Coast, I think.

280
01:05:11,898 --> 01:05:12,899
不好意思
Excuse me.

281
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,134
嗨
Oh, hey.

282

Uh, would you guys like, uh, still or sparkling water?

286
01:05:24,811 --> 01:05:27,447
你来选吧
Um, you pick.

287
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,781
我比较喜欢带汽的
Uh, I'm more of a sparkling guy,

- 那就汽水   - 就汽水吧

- Yeah? Cool. Yeah, I prefer a tequila. - Cool.

293

- Yeah, I know who they are. - Oh, my God.

2027
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:56,816
-她也太可爱了吧 -看这卷发
- She's so cute. - Look. Look at those curls.

2028
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:58,251
我曾带他们去看《破铜烂铁》外百老汇音乐剧
We took them to see Stomp Off-Broadway.

2029
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:00,086
-他们炒鸡欢快 -噢 天啊
- They went crazy! - Oh, my God.

2030
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:00,887
我超爱《破铜烂铁》
I love Stomp.

2031
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,855
《破铜烂铁》是什么？那是什么？
What's Stomp? What is that?

2032
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:03,789
它一直都是最棒的音乐剧
It's the greatest musical of all time.

2033
01:10:03,823 --> 01:10:04,790
是的 在这个剧中演员们表演敲打 比如敲打垃圾桶
Yeah, it's, like, that show where people play the drums on, like, garbage cans

2034
01:10:04,824 --> 01:10:07,026


2035
01:10:07,059 --> 01:10:08,928
再比如敲扫帚
and, like, tap with broomsticks.

2036
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:09,996
-敲打家里用的东西 -是的
- Stuff around the house. - Yeah.

2037
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,797
我们只觉得烤炉可做英式玛芬
Like, you just see a toaster, we make an English muffin.

2038
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:12,999



2039
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:15,902
他们可以用烤炉敲打出音乐 真不可思议
They-they see a whole song. It's incredible.


2040
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,870
据我所知流浪汉靠在地铁里敲打垃圾桶的盖子来索要
I know a homeless guy that plays trash can lids on the subway, for a dollar.


2041
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:19,872



2042
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:22,775
然后在站台被大家冷眼看待
And then he took a shit on the platform.

2043
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:24,810
噢 好吧
Oh. Well, you know.

2044
01:10:24,844 --> 01:10:27,113
也不知道他能不能获个托尼奖（音乐剧最高殊荣）什么的
I don't know if he's gonna get a Tony for that, but...

2045
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:29,182
也许他们不断的练习说不定哪天可以带着成人尿布
Maybe if they keep practicing and get an adult diaper,

2046
01:10:29,215 --> 01:10:32,185
去百脑汇表演
they can, uh, get to Broadway someday.

2047
01:10:32,218 --> 01:10:33,920


2048
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:35,321
好吧
Yeah.


2049
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:37,357
你们的感情是认真的吗？
So, are you guys really serious?

2050
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:39,091
噢
Uh-oh.

2051
01:10:39,892 --> 01:10:41,093
是这样的
Well, actually,

2052
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:46,366
我打算在今年的感恩节去波士顿见见他的父母
I'm going up to Boston to meet his parents at Thanksgiving.

2053
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,935
-哦 -什么？你要在感恩节的时候去波士顿...
- Oh. - What? You're going to Boston to...for Thanksgiving? To wha...

2054
01:10:48,968 --> 01:10:50,870


2055
01:10:50,903 --> 01:10:52,004
好吧 那我去哪呀？
Well, where-where am I gonna go?

2056
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:53,239
-你也可以和我一起 一起去 -是呀 我怎么办
-Ah, you'll come. You can come. -Yeah, me, too.

2057
01:10:53,272 --> 01:10:55,442
-我们也可以去的 -是呀 我们很乐意你们也去 -噢
-We can all go. - Yeah, we'd love to have you up there. - Oh.

2058
01:10:55,475 --> 01:10:57,743
你觉得你会再婚吗？
You think you're gonna get married again? 

2059
01:10:57,777 --> 01:10:59,779
噢 天啊 我这搞得让我们有点尴尬
Oh, boy, look what I got us into.

2060
01:10:59,812 --> 01:11:01,113
Claire
Claire. 

2061
01:11:01,147 --> 01:11:02,482
好吧 这个 我来
Well, you know what? I'll...

2062
01:11:02,516 --> 01:11:04,817
我来回答这个
I'll, uh, I'll answer that, you know?

2063
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,086
几个月前 我可能会不想结婚 但
A couple of months ago, I would've said no, but...

2064
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,921
嗯 我们能走了吗？
Uh, can we go?

2065
01:11:08,955 --> 01:11:10,089
Scott
Scott.

2066
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:10,923
别这么没礼貌
Don't be rude.

2067
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:12,058
我嘛？我不觉得我没礼貌
Me? I'm not being rude.

2068
01:11:12,091 --> 01:11:13,493
他一直都在叨逼叨
He's talking the entire time.

2069
01:11:13,527 --> 01:11:14,794
他才是没有礼貌的那个
Wha... He's the one being rude.

2070
01:11:14,827 --> 01:11:15,761
仅是聊天而已
Was just making conversation.

2071
01:11:15,795 --> 01:11:16,996
好吧 那你觉得我还可以说些什么？
Okay, so what did you want to say?

2072
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:19,165
-别扯了 -现在你想怎样
-Cut this shit. - Tell us now. 

2073
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:20,933
我想说我觉得我们是时候该离开了 怎么样？
All I wanted to say was I think it's time to go, okay?

2074
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,502
我很开心 简直太赞了
I had a great time. This is wonderful.

2075
01:11:22,536 --> 01:11:23,836
我认识我们已经情感交流过了
I think we all bonded.

2076
01:11:23,869 --> 01:11:25,972
是时候该离开了 好吗？
It's time to leave now, all right?

2077
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:27,541
好吧 我们稍后会去个派对
Well, we're going to a party later,

2078
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,275
你可以和我们一起
if you want to come with us.

2079
01:11:29,308 --> 01:11:30,410
你不能再让我难堪了
You just can't embarrass me.

2080
01:11:30,444 --> 01:11:32,311
好吧 无所谓了 让我们特么赶紧离开这
Sure, whatever. Let's just get the fuck out of here.

2081
01:11:34,947 --> 01:11:36,949
他在闹情绪
He's in a good mood.

2082
01:11:36,983 --> 01:11:39,952
试着你这辈子都哄着他
Try doing it your entire life.

2083
01:11:39,986 --> 01:11:40,886


2084
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,822
-今晚我们会玩得很开心的 -好的
-We're gonna have a good night. - Oh, yeah.

2085
01:11:42,855 --> 01:11:44,524
不 我们不会的 我很讨厌大学派对
No, we're not. I hate college parties.

2086
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:46,426
你可是从来都没有来过大学派对的
You've never been to a college party.

2087
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,994
好了 放飞自我
Come on, just enjoy it.

2088
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:50,464
-放轻松 投入进去 -对的 放轻松
-Relax. Go with it, okay? - Yes, relax.

2089
01:11:50,497 --> 01:11:53,132


2090
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:55,201

2091
01:11:55,234 --> 01:11:57,504


2092
01:11:57,537 --> 01:12:00,906


2093
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,041
你修什么专业？
What's your major?

2094
01:12:02,074 --> 01:12:05,278
是 嗯 嗯 社会进化学
It's, uh, uh, evolutionary sociology

2095
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:07,847
与生物学有点关系
with-with a splash of bio.

2096
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,815
哦 我觉得这个不太可能
Oh. I-I didn't know you could do that.

2097
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:12,151
你可以想特么干什么就干啥什么 这可是大学
Yeah, you can do whatever the fuck you want. It's college.

2098
01:12:12,184 --> 01:12:14,521


2099
01:12:14,554 --> 01:12:15,489


2100
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:18,558


2101
01:12:18,592 --> 01:12:20,360


2102
01:12:20,394 --> 01:12:22,462


2103
01:12:22,496 --> 01:12:25,298


2104
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:26,999
我喜欢你的纹身
I like your tattoos.

2105
01:12:27,033 --> 01:12:28,301
我是个演员 所以我不觉得
I'm an actress, so, like, I don't think

2106
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:29,969
我能纹许多处纹身 因为 比如
I can get that many tattoos, because, like,

2107
01:12:30,002 --> 01:12:32,204
如果我有个视镜 白莲花角色
what if I get cast as, like, an angelic role?

2108
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:34,474
那种年轻版的薇诺娜·瑞德
Like, I'm kind of, like, a young Winona Ryder.

2109
01:12:34,508 --> 01:12:37,444
我也可以演莎士比亚当年写的巨作
So, like, I could play those parts, and, like, also, like,

2110
01:12:37,477 --> 01:12:39,178
中的角色
back when Shakespeare was writing plays, like...

2111
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:40,313


2112
01:12:40,346 --> 01:12:43,215


2113
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:45,184


2114
01:12:45,217 --> 01:12:47,387
-你觉得如何？ -这是什么呀？
- What do you think? - What is that?

2115
01:12:48,622 --> 01:12:50,323
菊花
It's a butthole.

2116
01:12:50,357 --> 01:12:51,358
-懂吗？ -我的天啊
- Get it? - Oh, my God.

2117
01:12:51,391 --> 01:12:54,394


2118
01:12:54,428 --> 01:12:55,562


2119
01:12:55,595 --> 01:12:57,330
-嗯 -我们在谈论为什么百分之一的人口
- Uh-huh. - So, we're talking about how the one percent

2120
01:12:57,364 --> 01:12:59,366
越来越富有
keeps, like, getting bigger and bigger and bigger,

2121
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:02,569
贫富悬殊越来越严重
and the wealth inequality is just out of control,

2122
01:13:02,602 --> 01:13:06,406
而我们不能再继续以这种方式走资本主义道路
and we can't continue with capitalism this way.

2123
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,941
是的 我已经厌烦了这种无意义的竞争
Yeah, I'm s... I'm sick of the rat race.

2124
01:13:08,974 --> 01:13:10,943
是这样的
Yeah, no, exactly.

2125
01:13:10,976 --> 01:13:12,345
那“美国梦”会是神马样子？
Like, what happened to the American dream?

2126
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:15,247
据我所知 现在已经是“美国噩梦”
I know. It's like an American nightmare now.

2127
01:13:15,281 --> 01:13:17,083
-对 -是吧
- Oh, my... Yeah, exa... - Right?

2128
01:13:17,116 --> 01:13:20,319


2129
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,389


2130
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:24,458
-拿过来 太爽了 -哇 爽 
- Bring it... Oh, shit! - Oh! Oh, shit!

2131
01:13:24,491 --> 01:13:25,625
哇 爽
Oh, shit!

2132
01:13:25,659 --> 01:13:28,395


2133
01:13:28,428 --> 01:13:29,563
太特么爽了
That was fucking fun.

2134
01:13:29,596 --> 01:13:31,431
我当然知道 很爽
I know. It was so fun.

2135
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:32,998
是呀 我觉得
Yeah, like, I feel like,

2136
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:35,101
我觉得我头一次可以这般融入进去
I feel like I kind of fit in for once, you know?

2137
01:13:35,134 --> 01:13:37,336
第一次感受到不是所有人都讨厌我
And not everybody hated me for the first time.

2138
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,438
你可以常来呀
You should come here.

2139
01:13:38,472 --> 01:13:41,073
是吗？ 你觉得我有机会可以进入到这样的一个地方吗？
Yeah? You think I can get into a place like this?

2140
01:13:41,107 --> 01:13:42,975
我的意思是 你仅需要高分的成绩
I mean, you'd need a good GPA.

2141
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,276
好吧 我可没有考过高分
Yeah, well, I don't have a good one of those.

2142
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,479
我甚至高中都没毕业
I-I didn't even graduate high school.

2143
01:13:45,512 --> 01:13:47,213
不是得高中毕业才可以读大学吗？
Don't you have to graduate high school to go to college?

2144
01:13:47,246 --> 01:13:49,115
是的 不过现在着手去做为时不晚
Yeah, but it's not, like, too late to do that.

2145
01:13:49,148 --> 01:13:51,917
好吧 尽管这样 我还是觉得自己年纪有些大
All right, even so, you know, I-I'm a little too old.

2146
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:53,319
你懂吗 我看起来就像个缉毒警察
I'd look like a narc, you know?

2147
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:54,588
在角落里一呆很异类
I would look creepy in the corner.

2148
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:57,123
每个人都觉得 “这家伙在这干嘛”
Everybody'd be like, "What's that guy doing here?"


2149
01:13:57,156 --> 01:13:59,258
这里的每个人年纪都不小
Everybody here is so old.

2150
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:01,026
好吧 我就是个煞笔 好吗 Claire？
All right, well, I'm fucking stupid, Claire, okay?

2151
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,328
你想让我这样说吗？
Is that what you want me to say?

2152
01:14:02,362 --> 01:14:04,698
我无法集中精力 我无法安静的坐着 是吗？
I can't pay attention. I can't sit still, okay?

2153
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,366
我是个煞笔 我是个蠢货
I'm stupid. I'm a dumb idiot.

2154
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,402
我还得比其他人努力十倍
I would have to work ten times harder than those people.

2155
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:09,669
然后还特么被嘲笑
And everybody would fucking make fun of me,

2156
01:14:09,703 --> 01:14:12,639
我可不想再尝试一次 所以 不想
and I'm not ready to deal with that again, all right? So, no.

2157
01:14:12,672 --> 01:14:13,640
所以 就这样嘛？
So, that's it?

2158
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:16,008
啊？
Huh?

2159
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,411
这就是你长久以来觉得
That's how long you're gonna think about

2160
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:18,678
上大学的样子吗？
going to college for?

2161
01:14:18,712 --> 01:14:20,279
40秒步行
I mean, that was, like, a 40-second walk.

2162
01:14:20,312 --> 01:14:22,181
可以有很多想法 你不觉得吗？
Uh, that's a lot of consideration, don't you think?

2163
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:23,583
好吧
Okay.

2164
01:14:23,617 --> 01:14:25,485
-你的路程呵 -那是 
-It's your journey. - Indeed.

2165
01:14:25,519 --> 01:14:28,254
我们进入正题
Now, let's get down to brass tacks, all right?

2166
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:29,689
关于Ray的出现我们该怎么办？
W-What are we gonna do about Ray?

2167
01:14:29,723 --> 01:14:31,458
-什么意思？ -别装傻
- What do you mean? - Don't act stupid.

2168
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:35,027
我的意思是 我们该怎么做
I mean, h-how are we gonna, you know,

2169
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,596
使他与老妈分手？
get Mom to break up with him?

2170
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,197
我觉得他不错
I think he seems fine.

2171
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,299
-你觉得他不错？ -你有什么想法？
-You think he's fine? - What do you want?

2172
01:14:40,332 --> 01:14:42,402
那是老妈的选择 我们无权过问
It's Mom's choice to make. We don't need to get involved.

2173
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,604
好 我知道 但我们仍需要保护她
Yeah, I know, but we should still protect her.

2174
01:14:44,638 --> 01:14:45,539
她不能就这样继老爸后
She can't just be with

2175
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:47,707
下一个男人就随便好上了
the first guy she's been with since Dad.

2176
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:49,543
她该好好挑选下
She got to, like, peruse some dick.

2177
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:54,346
老妈不需要好好挑选下
Mom doesn't need to peruse dick.

2178
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:56,383
-你知道她需要的 -我觉得老妈很开心
-You know she needs to. - I think she seems happy.

2179
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:59,185
你想让她与N多人开车吗？
You want her to have sex with a ton of people?

2180
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:01,354
不 但 也许吧
No, but, yeah, kind of.

2181
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:02,589
-我的意思是...-真恶心
- I mean... - That's gross.

2182
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:05,224
可是 如果你知道在最开始的时候 情形会往坏处发展
Well, if you knew something was bad before it even started,

2183
01:15:05,257 --> 01:15:07,293
假设你有机会去阻止 难道你不会去阻止吗？
wouldn't you stop it if you had the chance?

2184
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:09,429
就像把希特勒扼杀在摇篮中一样 你懂的
It's like that whole baby Hitler thing, you know?

2185
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,198
如果你有机会在希特勒长大前 杀掉摇篮中的希特勒
If you had the chance to kill baby Hitler before it grew up,

2186
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:13,265
你会去做吗？
you do it?

2187
01:15:13,299 --> 01:15:15,201
你难道不会扼制它 让它完全完全死掉
Wouldn't you strangle it until its eyes popped out?

2188
01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:17,069
所以 Ray的“摇篮中的希特勒”
So, Ray's baby Hitler?

2189
01:15:17,102 --> 01:15:19,038
是呀 目前 他就是
Yeah. In this situation, he is, yeah.

2190
01:15:19,071 --> 01:15:20,039
他就是“摇篮中的希特勒”
He's baby Hitler.

2191
01:15:20,072 --> 01:15:22,341
你想帮我杀了这个“摇篮中的希特勒”吗？
So, do you want to help me kill baby Hitler?

2192
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:25,211
好吧 你全对 Scott 你全对
Okay, you're right, Scott. You're right.

2193
01:15:25,244 --> 01:15:27,747
-明天见 -Claire
-I'll see you tomorrow. - Claire!

2194
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:29,982
Claire
Claire!

2195
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:36,288


2196
01:15:36,322 --> 01:15:37,624
告诉你 Claire是真的
Tell you, Claire really seems like

2197
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:40,025
很喜欢大学生活
she's enjoying school, you know?

2198
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:41,495
是呀
Yeah.

2199
01:15:41,528 --> 01:15:44,631
她正当年呀
She's just blossoming.

2200
01:15:44,664 --> 01:15:46,198
是呀
Yeah.

2201
01:15:46,232 --> 01:15:48,368
她似乎觉得她可以拥有这个世界
Girl just seems like she could take on the world.

2202
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:49,369
我和你讲
I'll tell you,

2203
01:15:49,402 --> 01:15:52,472
无论你之前怎样培养过她 你做的太赞了
whatever you did with her, you did it right.

2204
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:55,140
也可以培养下Scott
Dump some of that on Scott, you know?

2205
01:15:57,644 --> 01:16:01,648
你觉得他的纹身餐厅的想法如何？
What do you think about his tattoo restaurant idea?

2206
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:03,550
我觉得不怎么样
I think it's terrible.

2207
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:06,185
纹身就像一个医疗疗程
Getting a tattoo is like, uh... it's a medical procedure.

2208
01:16:06,218 --> 01:16:07,754
你肯定不想看着病
You don't want to go to the hospital

2209
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:09,656
吃着晚饭
and order supper, you know?

2210
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:14,728
我就是欣赏他有远大的理想 不过他也太跳脱了
I just love that he has big dreams, but he's just so lost.

2211
01:16:14,761 --> 01:16:16,463
无论我怎么努力给他输入正能量 他就是
I mean, no matter how much I try to fill him with good energy, he just...

2212
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:19,098



2213
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:21,568
他毫无自信
he's got no self-esteem.

2214
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:24,471
他的前途可堪呀
He's really going nowhere.

2215
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:26,773
别这样责备自己
Don't be so hard on yourself.

2216
01:16:26,806 --> 01:16:28,274
科学家们从事这类研究很久
Scientists have been doing studies.

2217
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:30,309
他们觉得很多东西都是来自遗传
They say a lot of this stuff is genetic.

2218
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:32,546
你从你的祖父母们继承了这个
You know, you inherit it from your grandparents.

2219
01:16:32,579 --> 01:16:33,813
所以责任归于他们
So blame them.

2220
01:16:33,847 --> 01:16:36,215


2221
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:42,355


2222
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:47,827


2223
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:49,629
我们走
Let's go.

2224
01:16:51,665 --> 01:16:52,766


2225
01:16:52,799 --> 01:16:54,534
如果有人看见我们
Right. If anybody sees us

2226
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:58,538
或者你听见警笛再或者情况不妙 你给我传信息“你醒着呢吗？”
or you hear sirens or anything bad, you text me, "You up?"

2227
01:16:58,572 --> 01:16:59,639
我可以发些其他的东西给你吗？
Could I just text you something else?

2228
01:16:59,673 --> 01:17:02,308
这个感觉有点像我找你约炮...
That sounds like I'm trying to bang you, kind of.

2229
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:04,343
-按照我说的做 -好吧
-Just do it. -Fine.

2230
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:06,345
-好吧 -我们走
-Fine. -Let's go.

2231
01:17:06,379 --> 01:17:07,847
-我们出发 -等一下
-Let's roll. -Hold on.

2232
01:17:07,881 --> 01:17:09,482
好 我们出发
All right, let's go.

2233
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:10,717
一切顺利 兄弟
Good luck, homey.

2234
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,485
爱你 Scott
Love you, Scott.

2235
01:17:17,357 --> 01:17:19,593
我去
Oh, shit.

2236
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:21,728
玩真的
This is real.

2237
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:24,196


2238
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:25,532


2239
01:17:27,701 --> 01:17:29,234


2240
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:31,236



2241
01:17:41,881 --> 01:17:43,282
太赞了
Yes! All right.

2242
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,489



2243
01:17:55,929 --> 01:17:57,530
你死定了
You're dead.

2244
01:18:00,734 --> 01:18:01,935
你在干嘛？
What's going on?!

2245
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:02,936
卧槽
What the fuck?

2246
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:04,671
-你谁呀？ -你不该在这的
-Who are you?! -You're not supposed to be here.

2247
01:18:04,704 --> 01:18:06,506
你在说什么？这是我的店！
What are you talking about?! It's my store!

2248
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:07,474
你在和谁讲话？
Who are you talking to?

2249
01:18:07,507 --> 01:18:09,509
-他是谁呀？ -快进屋
-Who is that?! -Go back inside.

2250
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:11,378
-快进屋 -什么？不需要你告诉我进屋
-Go back inside! -What? Don't tell me to go back inside!

2251
01:18:11,411 --> 01:18:12,679
我在解决这事！
I'm handling this!

2252
01:18:12,712 --> 01:18:15,314
不错 不行 不错
Yes. No. Yes.

2253
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:17,717
不行 不错 不错 不行
No. Yes. Yes. No.

2254
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:18,785
赶快从我的店里滚出去！
Get the fuck out of my store!

2255
01:18:18,818 --> 01:18:19,786
-我不想伤害你 -滚出去
-I just don't want to hurt you, okay? -Get out!

2256
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:20,754
-我只是...-不能再容忍你们这样了
-I just... -You're not doing this again, okay?!

2257
01:18:20,787 --> 01:18:23,288
-这已经是第三次了 -你们够了！
-This is the third time! -Enough of you guys!

2258
01:18:23,322 --> 01:18:24,491
-一年里三次 -妈蛋的
-Third time this year! -Shit! Shit!

2259
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:26,359
-滚出去 -靠
-Get out! -What the hell?

2260
01:18:26,393 --> 01:18:28,561
-放开我 -今天绝对不行
-Get off me! -Not today!

2261
01:18:28,595 --> 01:18:31,731
今天绝对不行 今天是“反抗日”（Alan Moskowitz所制作的电影多为人类反抗电影）
Not today! Today is Alan Moskowitz's day!

2262
01:18:34,467 --> 01:18:37,404
这个漂亮的妹妹是谁？
Well, who's the pretty lady?

2263
01:18:37,437 --> 01:18:40,239
嗨 安吉丽娜朱莉
Hello, Angelina Jolie.

2264
01:18:40,272 --> 01:18:41,508


2265
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:43,443


2266
01:18:43,476 --> 01:18:45,210
-这怎么锁了！ -钥匙在哪？
- Yo, it's locked! - Where are the keys?

2267
01:18:45,244 --> 01:18:46,680
我们都把钥匙放在柜台
We left the keys on the counter.

2268
01:18:46,713 --> 01:18:47,681
为什么你把门锁了？
Why'd you lock the door?

2269
01:18:47,714 --> 01:18:50,383
那是我不想让其他人进来
Because I didn't want anybody to come in, man.

2270
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:52,552
不能再容忍你们这样对我了！
You're not gonna do this to me again!

2271
01:18:52,585 --> 01:18:53,420
决不可以在我的店里再有这种事
Not in my store!

2272
01:18:53,453 --> 01:18:55,588
-我们可从来没来过这呀！-妈蛋的
-We've never been here before! -Shit!

2273
01:18:55,622 --> 01:18:56,823


2274
01:18:56,856 --> 01:18:58,290
我绝不轻饶
I'm standing my ground!

2275
01:18:58,323 --> 01:19:00,360



2276
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:04,798
卧槽
Fuck.

2277
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:07,434
靠
Shit!

2278
01:19:07,467 --> 01:19:08,568


2279
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:11,236
“你醒着呢吗”“你醒着呢吗”“你醒着呢吗”
"You up? You up? You up?"


2280
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:12,439
-现在怎么办？ -别出声 别出声
-What's happening? -Be quiet. Be quiet.

2281
01:19:12,472 --> 01:19:13,773
别出声 别出声
Be quiet. Be quiet.


2282
01:19:14,808 --> 01:19:17,577


2283
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:19,012
“想约炮吗”“想约炮吗”“想约炮吗”“想约炮吗”
"Want to fuck? Want to fuck? Want to fuck? Want to fuck?"

2284
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:20,714
“想约炮吗”
"Do you want to fuck?

2285
01:19:20,747 --> 01:19:22,882
想约炮吗？ 想约炮吗？
Do you want to fuck? Do you want to fuck?

2286
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:25,719


2287
01:19:25,752 --> 01:19:26,786


2288
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:27,654
好吧 Igor
Okay, right, Igor.

2289
01:19:27,687 --> 01:19:28,788
接电话 Igor
Answer the phone, Igor.

01:19:28,822 --> 01:19:30,690
快接呀 快接呀 快接呀
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

2291
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:31,725


2292
01:19:31,758 --> 01:19:33,526



2293
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,562
不 不 不
No. No. No. No. No.

2294
01:19:35,595 --> 01:19:36,396
Scott
Scott.

2295
01:19:36,429 --> 01:19:38,631


2296
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:41,634


2297
01:19:41,668 --> 01:19:43,436



2298
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:44,604
快点关掉
Shut off your ringers!

2299
01:19:44,637 --> 01:19:46,806

Goddamn it.

2300
01:19:49,676 --> 01:19:52,879
嗨 Oscar 我是Scott
Hey, Oscar, it's, uh, Scott.

2301
01:19:52,912 --> 01:19:56,281
我很想知道
I was just, uh, wondering if, uh, you know,

2302
01:19:56,315 --> 01:19:57,917
你那事干完了嘛
you're almost done with that thing.

2303
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,719
我们需要钥匙
We need those keys.

2304
01:20:05,358 --> 01:20:06,659


2305
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,599


2306
01:20:14,934 --> 01:20:16,569
卧槽
Fuck that!

2307
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,605
靠
Holy shit!

2308
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:21,541


2309
01:20:21,574 --> 01:20:23,308
快点 Igor 快点！
Come on, Igor! Come on! Come on!

2310
01:20:23,342 --> 01:20:26,679


2311
01:20:27,346 --> 01:20:29,314
盗贼在里面
Um, the robbers are inside!

2312
01:20:29,348 --> 01:20:30,884
举起手来！
Hands in the air!

2313
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:32,519
店里那个女人有枪
The lady inside's got a gun.

2314
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:34,420
趴在地上
Get down on the ground!

2315
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:35,889
别动
Do not move!

2316
01:20:35,922 --> 01:20:38,525


2317
01:20:38,558 --> 01:20:40,527
为什么你们要抢劫药店？
Why would you rob a pharmacy?

2318
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,861
我没有在抢劫药店 
I wasn't robbing a pharmacy, okay?

2319
01:20:41,895 --> 01:20:43,797
我只是个望风的
I was the lookout, for your information.

2320
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,832
望风也是犯罪
The lookout is also committing a crime.

2321
01:20:45,865 --> 01:20:47,033
你脑子进水了吗？
Are you fucking crazy?

2322
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:48,468
听着 这都是Ray的错
Look, it's all Ray's fault, okay?

2323
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:49,803
他想踢我出局
He's trying to kick me out.

2324
01:20:49,836 --> 01:20:52,038
我恐慌了然后做了个错误的决定
So I panicked and made a bad decision, okay?

2325
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:53,072
我也会犯错的！
I'm only human!

2326
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:54,974
错误的决定？这可是重罪
A bad decision? That's a felony.

2327
01:20:55,008 --> 01:20:56,075
那又怎样？
Yeah, so?

2328
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:58,578
我根本就没进去 
I didn't even, I didn't even go inside, all right?

2329
01:20:58,611 --> 01:21:00,380
我与此事无关
Uh, it's not...I'm untouchable.

2330
01:21:00,413 --> 01:21:01,948
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything, all right?

2331
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:03,082
都是Ray的错
Uh, i-it's Ray, okay?

2332
01:21:03,116 --> 01:21:04,284
我知道他心存不轨
He... I-I know he's up to something.

2333
01:21:04,316 --> 01:21:07,020
-他就是想抹去老爸的存在 -你就不想让老妈幸福生活吗？
-He's trying to erase Dad. -Can you just let Mom be happy?

2334
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:08,221
老妈很幸福
She is happy.

2335
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:10,490
只要她离开那个人 老妈会幸福的
Well, she will be, you know, once I get rid of that guy.

2336
01:21:10,523 --> 01:21:12,659
他心存不轨 他心存不轨 
He's hiding shit, okay? He's hiding shit.

2337
01:21:12,692 --> 01:21:14,060
他就是个黄鼠狼 我已经发现他了
He's a weasel. I-I'm onto him.

2338
01:21:14,093 --> 01:21:15,595
这就是你为什么不想离家的原因
This is why I didn't want to leave,

2339
01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:17,564
你把你的神经质都放在了老妈身上
cause now all your crazy's focused on Mom.

2340
01:21:17,597 --> 01:21:18,765
我没做什么神经质的事
I'm not doing anything crazy, okay?

2341
01:21:18,798 --> 01:21:21,067
什么都不做才是神经质 我现在要做些什么
Doing nothing would be crazy. I'm doing something, okay?

2342
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,435
我要采取行动
I'm taking action!

2343
01:21:22,468 --> 01:21:24,938
别去骚扰老妈 你别再这样了
Leave Mom alone. Stop acting like you.

2344
01:21:24,971 --> 01:21:26,072
什么意思？
What's that mean?!

2345
01:21:26,105 --> 01:21:27,674
你毁掉了我的万圣节派对
You ruined my Halloween party.

2346
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:29,108
我明知故问
You know, you know what? You know what?

2347
01:21:29,142 --> 01:21:31,444
去好好享受你的派对 我了解了
Go enjoy your party. I-I got this.

2348
01:21:31,477 --> 01:21:34,380
你不了解 别做蠢事
You don't got this. Don't do anything.

2349
01:21:34,414 --> 01:21:35,448
我了解了
I got this.

2350
01:21:35,481 --> 01:21:36,983
别做蠢事！
Don't do anything!

2351
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:39,352


2352
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:56,736
嗨 Scott 有事吗？

2353
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:58,838
-嗨 -嗨
-Oh, hi. -Hi.

2354
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,474
我就是过来看看孩子们
I, uh... I just came by to say hi to the kids.

2355
01:22:01,507 --> 01:22:02,709
他们在吗？
Are-are they around?

2356
01:22:02,742 --> 01:22:03,810
噢
Oh.

2357
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:05,044
他们不在家
Well, they're not here.

2358
01:22:05,078 --> 01:22:07,046
他们去了他们的奶奶家
They went to their grandma's.

2359
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,548
哦
Oh.

2360
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:10,750
你在干嘛呢？
Well, what do you got going on over there?

2361
01:22:10,783 --> 01:22:12,752
我在开这瓶红酒
I'm trying to open this bottle of wine,

2362
01:22:12,785 --> 01:22:14,888
不过我把这木塞搞坏了
but I think I mangled the cork.

2363
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:15,855


2364
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:18,057
我可以帮忙 想让我帮把手吗？
Oh, well, I could help. You want me to help?

2365
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:19,893
好呀
Yes. Yes.

2366
01:22:19,926 --> 01:22:21,527

Please.

2367
01:22:22,061 --> 01:22:24,664
-耶 -好棒
- Yeah! - Yes.

2368
01:22:24,697 --> 01:22:27,166
你有好朋友来拜访吗？
So, uh, do you have a friend coming over or something?

2369
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,502
不 
Oh, no. 

2370
01:22:29,535 --> 01:22:31,905
不 我自己小酌下
No, I just need some mommy time.

2371
01:22:31,938 --> 01:22:36,042
当她们的孩子被送走 妈妈们需要小酌下的
Sometimes, mommies need to drink when the kids are away.

2372
01:22:36,075 --> 01:22:37,510
我可以一起吗？
Oh, well, could I hang?

2373
01:22:37,543 --> 01:22:39,479
我也想小酌下
I-I could use some mommy time.

2374
01:22:39,512 --> 01:22:42,048
当然可以 不过你到了可以饮酒的年龄了吗？
Sure, but are you old enough to drink?

2375
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:44,017
当然 我已经到了可饮酒的年龄 我还想吸点
Yeah, I'm old enough. I just... I'd rather smoke.

2376
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:45,485
不介意我在这吸大麻吧？
Do you mind if I smoke in here?

2377
01:22:45,518 --> 01:22:46,786
不介意
Oh, no. No.

2378
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:48,621
让我们嗨起来
Let's crack some windows.

2379
01:22:48,655 --> 01:22:50,924
-今天可是周二 -确定吗？
-It's Tuesday. -Really?

2380
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:53,092
Ray不喜欢我吸大麻
Cause Ray hates when I smoke weed.

2381
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:55,695
我不喜欢Ray
Mm. Well, I hate Ray.

2382
01:22:55,728 --> 01:22:57,163
太赞了
Awesome.

2383
01:22:57,196 --> 01:23:00,566


2384
01:23:04,704 --> 01:23:06,839
-嗯 -你知道嘛...
-Mm. -You know...

2385
01:23:08,107 --> 01:23:09,909
你的孩子是我见过
You have the sweetest,

2386
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,111
最讨喜最可爱的
most adorable kids I've ever met in my life.

2387
01:23:12,145 --> 01:23:14,080
我简直不敢相信是Ray的孩子
Like, I can't believe they came out of Ray.

2388
01:23:14,113 --> 01:23:15,982
我懂
I know.

2389
01:23:16,015 --> 01:23:17,183
你知道吗？
And you know what?

2390
01:23:17,216 --> 01:23:18,885
关于Ray
You know what the thing is about Ray?

2391
01:23:18,918 --> 01:23:22,055
我从来没在孩子们的面前说过他的一句坏话
I never say a bad word about him in front of the kids,

2392
01:23:22,088 --> 01:23:27,093
做这事炒鸡难的 因为他就是个混蛋
which is very difficult because he's a cunt.

2393
01:23:27,126 --> 01:23:28,628
是的 我可以想象
Yeah, I-I can imagine.

2394
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:32,598
我不是他的孩子 所以来说他的坏话吧
Well, I'm not one of your kids, so have at it.

2395
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:35,101
都说出来吧 都告诉我
Let it all out. Tell me everything.

2396
01:23:35,134 --> 01:23:37,537
你知道嘛 他一直都不想
Do you know he is fighting to

2397
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,673
抚养他的孩子
actively not have custody of his kids?

2398
01:23:40,707 --> 01:23:42,075
-你居然接受？ -是呀
-You can do that? -Yeah.

2399
01:23:42,108 --> 01:23:43,710
-简直不可想象 -我懂
-That's insane. -I know.

2400
01:23:43,743 --> 01:23:45,044
居然有人不想和你的孩子在一起？
Who wouldn't want to hang with your kids?

2401
01:23:45,078 --> 01:23:47,246
谁不想跟那些孩子们一起玩啊
Who wouldn't want to hang out with those kids?

2402
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,049
什么样的怪物会不想跟那些孩子们一起玩啊
What monster wouldn't want to hang out with those kids?

2403
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,551
每一秒都那么美好
Every second!

2404
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:52,719
你姑娘那天唱了首歌
Your daughter sang the other day.

2405
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:53,853
她唱了啥
What did she sing?

2406
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:56,055
俄克拉荷马里的什么吧
Something from, like, Oklahoma! or something,


2407
01:23:56,089 --> 01:23:57,991
虽然我讨厌那破玩意 但是我他妈的爱死她的歌声了
and-and I hate that shit, and I fucking loved it.

2408
01:23:58,024 --> 01:24:00,626
她真是个小天使
She's such a little angel.

2409
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,862
- 嗯  - 我还以为她是个机器人什么的
- Mm.  - I-I thought she was a robot for, like,

2410
01:24:02,895 --> 01:24:05,031
最初跟她玩的那几天的时候
the first couple days I was hanging out with her.

2411
01:24:05,064 --> 01:24:06,799
我说吧  她真的好完美啊
I know. She's so perfect.

2412
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,301
什么品种的傻逼啊
What a fucking putz.

2413
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,802
嗯 所以他只想在
Yeah, so he only wants to see them


2414
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:12,205
周三晚饭和周日的时候探望他们
on Wednesday night for dinner and Sunday.


2415
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:14,974
- 你不能这样随便挑的  - 还有
-  You can't just pick and choose.  - And, uh...


2416
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:15,808
对啊 你不能挑的
No, you can't.

2417
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,543
把孩子当什么了 橄榄球季票么
What are your kids, the NFL package?

2418
01:24:17,577 --> 01:24:19,045
- 等等 对啊  - 对吧
- Wait, you're only... Yeah.  - Yeah.

2419
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:21,014
不过你也不会想要孩子的监护权的
But why would you want your kids, really·,

2420
01:24:21,047 --> 01:24:25,918
尤其现在你连自己的住所都没有还睡在消防队里
if you don't have an apartment and you sleep at the firehouse?


2421
01:24:25,952 --> 01:24:28,087
就是
I mean, you...

2422
01:24:28,121 --> 01:24:29,288
无法理喻
Unbelievable.


2423
01:24:29,322 --> 01:24:30,890
什么样的成年男人
What kind of a grown man

2424
01:24:30,923 --> 01:24:33,292
在史泰登岛住不起自己的屋子
can't afford his own apartment in Staten Island?

2425
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:35,061
真他妈废物
Fucking loser.

2426
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:37,864
他把我们所有的钱都赌输了
He lost all our money gambling.

2427
01:24:37,897 --> 01:24:43,169
他无家可归 身无分文 还是个不负责的孩子爹
He is homeless, he's penniless, and he's a deadbeat dad.

2428
01:24:43,202 --> 01:24:45,038
你妈为啥跟他在一起啊
What is your mom doing with him?

2429
01:24:45,071 --> 01:24:47,707
你懂得 我妈17年都没对象
You know, my mom hasn't gotten laid in 17 years,

2430
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,275
所以我觉得她的标准相当低了
so I think her bar is pretty low.

2431
01:24:49,308 --> 01:24:52,045
真的  好吧
Really? Yeah.

2432
01:24:52,078 --> 01:24:54,180
虽然不想承认 但是他床上倒是真不错
He's good in bed, I hate to say it.

2433
01:24:54,213 --> 01:24:55,114
好吧
All right.

2434
01:24:55,148 --> 01:24:57,850
好吧 我倒不是真的需要知道这事
Well, I didn't really need to know that.

2435
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:58,718
嗯啊
Yeah.

2436
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:01,054
他有个漂亮的鸡巴
He's got a beautiful cock.

2437

- About him telling you lies about me.  - He's an animal.

他抱起我然后扔到了泳池里
He picked me up and he threw me in the pool.

你不尊重我的家庭

你看到的只是事情的一部分
Okay, you don't have all the information you need.

2532
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,028
Scott在作妖
All right? Scott is acting out

2533
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:57,997
因为他不敢前进
'cause he's afraid to move on with his life.

2534
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:59,499
跟波士顿红袜队
It's no different than when the Boston Red Sox

2535
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:00,567
终于赢了世界大赛是一个原理的

- where-where they believed, okay?  - Just shut up.

2538
01:28:03,503 --> 01:28:04,671
- 所有  - 你他妈闭嘴
- All-all...  - Shut the fuck up.


2539
01:28:04,705 --> 01:28:07,139
我就问了他一个问题 然后他就翻脸了
All I did was just ask him a question, and he flipped out.

2540
01:28:07,173 --> 01:28:08,808
所有我就把他放在温和的水里
So I put him in the water, which is soft.

2541
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:09,742
我缓解这个危机
I diffused the situation.


2542
01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:11,177
我的培训里都有这些的
It was what-what m-my training's all about.


2543
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,546
我 我真的是缓解了这个危机
I-I wa... I was totally diffusing the situation.

2544

你有闭嘴的时候吗
Do you ever shut up?


2545
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,280
你他妈有闭嘴的时候吗
Do you ever just shut the fuck up?


2546
01:28:14,313 --> 01:28:16,282
你就在那叭叭叭叭
You just talk and you talk and you talk,


2547
01:28:16,315 --> 01:28:17,817
自己都不知道自己在讲啥
and you don't know what you're saying.


2548
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,085
狗屁不通
It makes no sense.


2549
01:28:19,118 --> 01:28:21,053
感觉就像你收集了各种
It's like you picked up all these little pieces


2550
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,055
各样的信息
of information from all over.


2551
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,991
全是断片的  毫无意义的
They don't make any sense. They're fragments.

2552
01:28:25,024 --> 01:28:27,126
无意的 废话
No sense. Nonsense.


2553
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:32,832
我现在不讲了
I-I'm not talking.


2554
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,535
我忍了这么多了 我不管了
I've had it up to here. I'm done.


2555
01:28:35,569 --> 01:28:38,204
你俩 滚犊子
Both of you, get your shit out of here.


2556
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,076
Margie.

2557
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:46,546
操
Oh, fuck.



2558
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,547

那么 现在我们去哪儿
Well, where do we go now?

2560

你问我干啥
What are you asking me for?


2561
01:28:52,251 --> 01:28:55,788
你捅的娄子 你个蠢货

How about next time you put your mask on

2704
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,056
然后再下车
before we get off the rig?

2705

- waiting for you. What the hell?   - I told him to.

2707
01:35:06,693 --> 01:35:07,927
Always with the backhanded compliment.
总是阴阳怪气的夸人

2708
01:35:07,961 --> 01:35:09,261
你为啥就不能
Why can't you just, you know,

2709
01:35:09,294 --> 01:35:10,463
说两句好听的
at least say the nice thing and then...

2710
01:35:10,497 --> 01:35:12,599
- 跟你 给句好话就不错了 - 好吧

我更能接受鼓励什么的
I would respond better to encouragement.

He's soft. He can't take it.

2718
01:35:21,775 --> 01:35:22,942

- You're right.  - He's an emotional eater.

2719

可不 这一代的毛病就是这个
Well, that's the problem with this generation, man.

Look, uh, I-I don't have anywhere else to go, all right?

2734

我没有办法了 所以
I'm out of options, so...

2735

Go sleep under a tree. I don't care.

你知道你让我失去了什么吗  你知道吗
Do you have any idea what you took from me? Do you?

2739

嗯  你采访我前妻采访了60分钟
Huh? You do a 60-minute interview with my ex-wife

2740
01:36:03,683 --> 01:36:05,552
去了解了我是个什么样的人
to find out what kind of guy I am?

2741
01:36:05,585 --> 01:36:07,319
你觉得她准备说啥
What do you think she was gonna say?

2742

- 我不知道啊  - 顺便
- I don't know. I...  - By the way,

I'm not a gambler, okay? I day-trade.

2744
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,525
我不知道有啥区别啊
I don't know the difference.

2745
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:14,561
那你张嘴之前应该先去弄明白有啥区别啊
You should've found out before you shot your mouth off.

2746
01:36:14,594 --> 01:36:16,396
我知道你吸了不少大麻 但是你不蠢
I know you smoke a lot of weed, but you're not dumb.

你知道你他妈的自己在干啥
You knew what the fuck you were doing.

你去找了世界上最恨我的人
You went to the person that hates me the most

2749
01:36:19,632 --> 01:36:21,333
得到了我所能得到的最差的评价
to get the worst review you could possibly get.

2750
01:36:21,367 --> 01:36:22,869
你咋不来这而问问这些人呢
Why didn't you come down here and ask these guys

2751
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:23,670
问问他们觉得我怎么样
what they thought of me?

2752
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:25,739
你有想过这么做么
Did you ever think of doing that?

2753
01:36:25,772 --> 01:36:27,874
抱歉  你说的对 你说的对
I'm sorry. You're right. You're right.

2754
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,542
- 额 我不应该  - 你才没有歉意
- Uh, I shouldn't have done...  - You're not sorry

2755
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:30,677
否则你就不会那么干了  所以现在呢
or you wouldn't have done it. So now what?

2756
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:31,878
现在你没地方住了
Now you don't have a place to stay?

2757
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,847
你现在跑到这里来瞪着你那水灵灵的大眼睛
So now you come down here with your little puppy dog look

2758
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,882
然后我就会于心不忍么
on your face, and I'm supposed to feel bad?

2759
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,117
但是 我知道
Look, all I know is,

2760
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,886
如果你不对我好 我妈会恨你一辈子
if you're not nice to me, then my mom will hate you forever

2761
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:41,588
而且永远不会原谅你
and she'll never forgive you.

2762
01:36:41,621 --> 01:36:43,056
真的  这种情感牌你也敢打
Really? You're gonna play that card?

2763

这 这牌超好用的
It's a, it's a pretty good card.

Why don't you dip your weed in NyQuil,

楼下那间厕所 我用过了
The bathroom downstairs...I-I used it.

2835
01:39:47,206 --> 01:39:48,708
你就从那间开始吧
You can start there.

2836
01:39:48,741 --> 01:39:50,476
好极了呢
Great.

2837
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:52,478
戴上手套哈 容易溅上
Get gloves. Pretty muddy.

2838
01:39:52,512 --> 01:39:53,980
你知道吗 当我看到这种大块污渍
You know, when I see a big stain like that,

2839
01:39:54,013 --> 01:39:56,816
我就先上下刷 然后左右刷
I go up and down, and then I go left and right.

2840
01:39:56,849 --> 01:39:58,685
- 真是美好时光呢   - 这就对了
- Good times.   - There you go.

2841
01:39:58,718 --> 01:40:00,586
你要把溅上去的也洗了
You got to get the splatter.

2842
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,121


2843
01:40:02,155 --> 01:40:04,757
看到了吗 真是条完美的直线
You see that? That's a nice straight line.

2844
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:08,194
你们要做很多无聊的工作哈
Yeah, you guys, uh, got to do a lot of shit work, huh?

2845
01:40:08,227 --> 01:40:09,963
我们不会说这是无聊的工作
We don't refer to it as shit work.

2846
01:40:09,996 --> 01:40:12,231
这是我们的家 我们希望它漂漂亮亮的
This is our house. We want it to look nice.

2847
01:40:12,265 --> 01:40:14,100
懂吗 集体荣誉
You know, company pride.

2848
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:15,635
要用热水洗
You got to wash it hot.

2849
01:40:15,668 --> 01:40:18,137
热水 不是温水 不是冷水 要很热
Hot. Not warm, not cold. Extra hot.

2850
01:40:18,171 --> 01:40:19,939
- 好的  - 因为有臭虫
- Okay.  - Because of the bedbugs.

2851
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:21,074
啥 什么是臭虫
What-What's bedbugs?

2852
01:40:21,107 --> 01:40:22,842
就是 呃 一种小昆虫
They're, uh, a-a tiny insect

2853
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:25,578
它们进了你的家门就要把你逼走
that get into your home and they run you out.

2854
01:40:25,611 --> 01:40:27,547


2855
01:40:33,953 --> 01:40:35,121


2856
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,490


2857
01:40:42,628 --> 01:40:44,130
- 你知道它们怎么繁殖吗  - 不知道
- You know how they procreate?  - No.

2858
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,232
雄性臭虫把他的丁丁
The male bedbug takes his penis

2859
01:40:46,265 --> 01:40:48,001
塞进雌性的肚子里
and jams it into the female's stomach.

2860
01:40:48,034 --> 01:40:50,903
雌性臭虫有阴道吗 是有的
Does the female have a vagina? Yeah, she does.

2861
01:40:50,937 --> 01:40:51,838
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

2862
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:53,873
他塞进她的肚子里
He jams it into her stomach.

2863
01:40:53,906 --> 01:40:55,842
你是怎么知道这些的 兄弟
Well, how do you know all this, man?

2864
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:57,810
我怎么知道 我研究过啊
How do I know? I researched it.

2865
01:40:59,912 --> 01:41:01,848
- 就翻过来  - 哦 翻过来
- Just flip it over. Flip.  - Oh, just a flip.

2866
01:41:01,881 --> 01:41:03,016
- 对了 没错  - 好的
- There you go, yeah.  - Okay.

2867
01:41:03,049 --> 01:41:04,784
你学会了 就顺着翻下来
You got it. Just flip it right down.

2868
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:06,919
- 叠得很好啊  - 嗯
- Very nice.  - Mm.

2869
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:09,922
干得好
Well done.

2870
01:41:09,956 --> 01:41:12,658
当你长了臭虫 所有人都会离开你
When you have bedbugs, everybody leaves.

2871
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:13,626
我父母不和我联系了
My parents stopped calling.

2872
01:41:13,659 --> 01:41:15,628
我兄弟姐妹不来看我了
My brothers and sisters stopped coming over.

2873
01:41:15,661 --> 01:41:17,730
我女朋友把我甩了 所有人都走了
My girl left. Everybody's gone.

2874
01:41:17,764 --> 01:41:20,033
你知道最后谁会留在你身边吗
And you know who's there for you at the end?

2875
01:41:20,066 --> 01:41:21,034
真是讽刺
Ironically?

2876
01:41:21,067 --> 01:41:21,868
只有臭虫
The bedbugs.

2877
01:41:21,901 --> 01:41:24,070
我从没想过我会这么说
I never thought I'd say it,

2878
01:41:24,103 --> 01:41:25,838
如果我当上了主厨 我就让你做我的助手
but if I make chief, I'm making you my aide.

2879
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:27,240
- 是吗  - 你好啊小子
- Yeah?  - What's up, kid?

2880
01:41:27,273 --> 01:41:29,642
你觉得你测试做得怎么样
Well, how do you think you did on the test?

2881
01:41:29,675 --> 01:41:30,511
测试太难了
Tough test.

2882
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,178
当然了 我希望我做的还不错
I mean, you know, I hope I did good.

2883
01:41:32,211 --> 01:41:33,613
我操
Fuck!

2884
01:41:40,019 --> 01:41:41,888
- 他干得不错
- He's doing a good job.  - (scoffs)

2885
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:43,756
他洗车洗得不错
He knows how to wash a truck.

2886
01:41:43,790 --> 01:41:46,360
那就收拾收拾去洗车行干吧
Getting ready for his career working at a car wash.

2887
01:41:46,393 --> 01:41:48,895
你怎么就不肯放过这孩子
You ever gonna give this kid a break or what?

2888
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,130
我不知道该做什么
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2889
01:41:52,198 --> 01:41:54,067
那就什么都别做
Then do nothing.

2890
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:58,304
Stan死的时候是你负责这个工作吗
Were you on the job when Stan was killed?

2891
01:41:58,337 --> 01:42:00,773
是啊 你知道是我
Yeah. You know I was.

2892
01:42:00,807 --> 01:42:04,077
你听说的时候第一个念头是什么
What's the first thing you thought of when you heard?

2893
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:10,083
我在想他有没有孩子
I-I wondered if he had kids.

2894
01:42:20,827 --> 01:42:22,795
我们到底为什么要洗车
Why do we have to clean this thing anyway?

2895
01:42:22,829 --> 01:42:24,864
反正它都会着火
It's just gonna get fire on it.

2896
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:26,866
那些被活活烧死的人
You think the people that are burning alive

2897
01:42:26,899 --> 01:42:29,068
会在乎车洗得亮不亮吗
give a fuck if the truck is shiny?

2898
01:42:29,102 --> 01:42:30,169
我就随口一说
Just saying.

2899
01:42:30,203 --> 01:42:32,038
我都不知道你为什么要洗车
I don't even know why you got to clean the truck.

2900
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:35,208
怎么地 你还想在大火面前性感一点吗
What, you're trying to show up all sexy to a fire?

2901
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:37,710
我喜欢他
I like him.

2902
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,648


2903
01:42:42,682 --> 01:42:44,617


2904
01:42:49,423 --> 01:42:51,023
不要 住手
No! No! Stop!

2905
01:42:51,057 --> 01:42:52,859
够了
All right!

2906
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:57,630
我给你扶一下书包 滑下来了
Let me fix that backpack. It's slipping.

2907
01:42:59,932 --> 01:43:02,268
你送我去学校感觉好奇怪
It's weird having you walk me to school.

2908
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,736
为什么呢
Why is that?

2909
01:43:03,769 --> 01:43:06,672
因为平时都是Scott送我
'Cause Scott always walks me.

2910
01:43:06,706 --> 01:43:09,142
有时候我也送你
I walk you sometimes.

2911
01:43:09,175 --> 01:43:10,910
可能是吧
I guess so.

2912
01:43:12,379 --> 01:43:15,314
他和你们在一起时奇怪吗
Is he, uh, is he weird around you guys?

2913
01:43:15,348 --> 01:43:16,716
没有啊
No.

2914
01:43:16,749 --> 01:43:18,385
他挺好的
He's nice.

2915
01:43:18,418 --> 01:43:20,920
他经常问我还好吗
He asks me how I'm doing.

2916
01:43:20,953 --> 01:43:23,289
你怎么回答他
What do you tell him?

2917
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:25,725
我说我还好
I say I'm doing fine.

2918
01:43:25,758 --> 01:43:28,728
你不用说谎来照顾我的感受 好吗
Look, you don't have to lie to make me feel better, all right?

2919
01:43:28,761 --> 01:43:30,897
我知道我和你妈妈做得不够好
I know me and your mom could do a better job

2920
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:33,299
我们应该一起克服这事
getting along through all of this, and, uh...

2921
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,269
对不起 我处理得并不好
Hey, I'm sorry if I haven't handled it so well.

2922
01:43:38,472 --> 01:43:40,773
这是什么
What's that?

2923
01:43:40,806 --> 01:43:42,442
这是【闪电冰侠】
Oh, that's Ice Flash.

2924
01:43:42,476 --> 01:43:45,912
Scott给我画的 但是画得不太好
Scott drew it for me, but it didn't come out so good.

2925
01:43:45,945 --> 01:43:48,748
是啊 我觉得他画的很乱
Yeah, I think his drawings are a little shaky.

2926
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,683
这张是我画的
That's the one that I drew.

2927
01:43:53,453 --> 01:43:55,121
这是他画的
This is how he drew it.

2928
01:44:00,126 --> 01:44:01,361
挺不错吧
It's good, right?

2929
01:44:01,395 --> 01:44:03,829
是啊 岂止是不错
Yeah, it's better than good.

2930
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:06,065
这很厉害
Did a great job.

2931
01:44:06,098 --> 01:44:07,066
是啊
Yeah.

2932
01:44:07,099 --> 01:44:08,935
他说他会教我
He said he was gonna teach me.

2933
01:44:08,968 --> 01:44:11,337
他说他要教你画这个吗
He said he'd teach you how to do that?

2934
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:12,905
对
Yeah.

2935
01:44:13,773 --> 01:44:15,942
他说话算数
And he stays to his word.

2936
01:44:22,848 --> 01:44:24,083


2937
01:44:24,116 --> 01:44:25,918

2942
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:32,291
这是怎么了
What's going on in here?

2943
01:44:32,325 --> 01:44:33,859
这是 为什么全都不一样了
Where... Why is everything so different?

2944
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:35,529
好看吗 你喜欢吗
Isn't it nice? Do you like it?

2945
01:44:35,562 --> 01:44:38,030
那是张粉色的椅子吗
Is that a pink chair?

2946
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:40,467
- 是啊 我们在重新装修  - 这窗帘怎么也变了

你最近都去哪里了
Where have you been staying?

Oh, okay. Well, I'm just glad that you're not on the street.

我确实明白你之前的想法了
I really understand where you were coming from before.

2964
01:45:12,832 --> 01:45:14,166
就是你把我赶出去的时候
You know, when you threw me out.

2965
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,802
我觉得我现在已经改过自新了
Like, I think I really got my shit together now,

01:50:08,227 --> 01:50:09,596
- 他就  - 怎么了
- So he's...  - What?

3106
01:50:09,629 --> 01:50:10,697
他就
he's, like...

3107
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:11,631
- 怎么样
- What?

3108
01:50:11,665 --> 01:50:14,568
就趴在那 咒骂我们 他的脸
Hanging on, cursing at us, putting his face

3109
01:50:14,601 --> 01:50:15,635
就挤在挡风玻璃上
up against the windshield.

3110
01:50:15,669 --> 01:50:17,771
他骂道 你们这些狗日的
He's like, "You motherfuckers!"

3111
01:50:17,804 --> 01:50:20,574
- 就很像阿汤哥的电影
- It was like some real Tom Cruise shit.


3112
01:50:20,607 --> 01:50:22,174
然后
So... 

3113
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:24,176


3114
01:50:24,209 --> 01:50:25,612
我们到了布鲁克林
We get into Brooklyn.

3115
01:50:25,645 --> 01:50:27,581
当然啦 那就有警察
And sure-sure enough, there's cops.

3116
01:50:27,614 --> 01:50:29,716
就像专门在那等我们似的
Like, uh, like they were waiting for us.

3117
01:50:29,749 --> 01:50:30,784
糟了
Oh, shit.

3118
01:50:30,817 --> 01:50:32,586
我就想 我们肯定完蛋了
So now I'm like, "Oh, fuck. We're screwed."

3119
01:50:32,619 --> 01:50:34,854
Stan从车上下来 他对着警察走过去
Stan gets off the car. He goes over to the cop.

3120
01:50:34,888 --> 01:50:38,123
我就想 完了 他要去跟警察闹事了
I'm thinking, "Oh, shit, he's gonna fucking clock this cop.

3121
01:50:38,157 --> 01:50:39,459
他肯定会那样
He's gonna, you know..."

3122
01:50:39,492 --> 01:50:41,461
结果他直接走过去 捧着警察的脸
And he goes right up to him, grabs his face,

3123
01:50:41,494 --> 01:50:43,830
亲了他的嘴
and he kisses him on the lips.

3124
01:50:43,863 --> 01:50:44,631


3125
01:50:44,664 --> 01:50:46,298
他们是高中同学
They went to high school together.

3126
01:50:46,332 --> 01:50:47,767
搞半天他们是高中同学
They went to fucking high school together.

3127
01:50:47,801 --> 01:50:49,836
我就想 只有Stan才能逃脱这种事
I'm like, "Only Stan could get away with that."

3128
01:50:49,869 --> 01:50:51,303
真的 我发誓
I swear to God.

3129
01:50:51,337 --> 01:50:52,472
你知道吗 传闻说
Well, you know, the rumor is

3130
01:50:52,505 --> 01:50:53,673
他的可卡因就是从警察这拿的
that he got the coke from the cops.

3131
01:50:53,707 --> 01:50:56,342
不是那一个警察 他还认识一个在曼哈顿的警察
Not that cop. There was another cop he knew in Manhattan.

3132
01:50:56,376 --> 01:50:57,811
- 什么 不是吧不是吧不是吧
- What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No.

3133
01:50:57,844 --> 01:50:59,512
- 可卡因 啥 不是吧  - 伙计们
- Coke? What? No.  - Guys, guys, guys.

3134
01:50:59,546 --> 01:51:01,581
- 那是他父亲啊  - 所以呢
- Guys, it's his dad.  - So?

3135
01:51:01,615 --> 01:51:02,849
- 我不知道这不能说  - 那是他父亲
- I didn't know it was a secret.  -  It's his dad.

3136
01:51:02,882 --> 01:51:04,249
你们不能话说一半啊
You can't just tease me with that.

3137
01:51:04,283 --> 01:51:05,250
- 拜托了 伙计们  - 可这是
- Please, guys, but...  - It was...

3138
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,219
你们不懂 我妈跟我说
You don't understand. My mom, my mom tells me

3139
01:51:07,252 --> 01:51:08,355
说了好多他的故事
all these stories about how much

3140
01:51:08,388 --> 01:51:09,356
说他就是个圣人啊什么的
he's like a saint and all that shit.

3141
01:51:09,389 --> 01:51:10,890
我超想听可卡因的故事
Like, I-I would love to hear a coke story.

3142
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:12,191
- 拜托了  - 说13禁的版本
- Please.  - The PG-13 version.

3143
01:51:12,224 --> 01:51:13,325
不要啊 说完整的版本
No, you don't...No, the real version.

3144
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,594
你们不懂我承受的压力
You don't understand the amount  of pressure I'm under,

3145
01:51:14,628 --> 01:51:16,596
- 以为他是个完美的人  - 好吧 随你了
- thinking this guy's perfect.  - All right, fuck it, fuck it.

3146
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:18,365
好吧 我们那时候都磕得上头了
All right, we were coked out of our minds.

3147
01:51:18,398 --> 01:51:19,432
- 秒啊  - 是吗 我们全都磕了
- Nice.  - All right? We all were.

3148
01:51:19,466 --> 01:51:21,568
- 我们 是啊 我们都有份
- We all... Well, I mean, uh, we were.

3149
01:51:21,601 --> 01:51:23,637
- 但是时代不一样 那时候我们都有份  - 是啊
- But that was a different time. I mean, we all did it.  - Right.

3150
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,471
这家伙是个瘾君子
This guy was the cokehead.

3151
01:51:24,504 --> 01:51:26,238
- 你就是个瘾君子  - 好吧
- You were the cokehead.  - All right.

3152
01:51:26,271 --> 01:51:28,207
我四年前就戒了 你知道的
I stopped four years ago. You know that.

3153
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,075
你在说啥 你以为
What are you talk...How do you think

3154
01:51:29,109 --> 01:51:30,377
他这些年怎么保持这么瘦的
he stayed this skinny all these years?

3155
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:31,444
那是因为我新陈代谢快
No, I have a high metabolism.

3156
01:51:31,478 --> 01:51:34,246
你的脸皮应该刻在玻利维亚的硬币上
They should have his face on a nickel in Bolivia.

3157
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:36,449


3158
01:51:38,718 --> 01:51:40,453
但那是玩闹的时候 好吗
But playtime was playtime, all right?

3159
01:51:40,487 --> 01:51:42,789
你知道 当他工作的时候
Like, you know, when he was at work,

3160
01:51:42,822 --> 01:51:45,725
他就非常的专业
he was, he was all, you know, business.

3161
01:51:45,759 --> 01:51:48,193
他就是那种 当你冲进火场的时候
All right? And he was the guy you wanted by your side

3162
01:51:48,227 --> 01:51:50,195
你希望站在你身边的人
if-if you were going into a fire.

3163
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:51,398
我是说 如果你要
Yeah, I mean, if they were gonna,

3164
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:53,433
从零开始塑造一个消防员的话
like, build a fireman from scratch,

3165
01:51:53,466 --> 01:51:56,469
他就是那个
he would've been, you know...

3166
01:51:56,503 --> 01:51:57,637
- 模板  - 是啊
- Prototype.  - Yeah. Yeah.

3167
01:51:57,671 --> 01:51:59,806
没错 他从头到脚
Exactly. You know, top to bottom...

3168
01:51:59,839 --> 01:52:02,509
都是一个真正的消防员
He's a fireman.

3169
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:03,443
知道吗
You know?

3170
01:52:03,476 --> 01:52:05,945
- 他是最勇敢的那种人  - 是啊
- You know, as brave as they come.  - Yeah.

3171
01:52:05,979 --> 01:52:09,883
我想到是玩游戏说
You know, I was thinking about what you said at the game

3172
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:14,186
消防员不应该生孩子
about, you know, like, firemen shouldn't have kids.

3173
01:52:15,855 --> 01:52:17,289
我告诉你
Let me tell you something.

3174
01:52:17,322 --> 01:52:19,659
你爸爸并不仅仅是那天晚上
You know, your dad, he didn't just die

3175
01:52:19,693 --> 01:52:21,695
救了两个人然后牺牲了
saving those two people that night.

3176
01:52:21,728 --> 01:52:23,463
他做了太多次
I mean, he did that a lot.

3177
01:52:23,496 --> 01:52:24,998
你知道吗 有时候
You know, like, sometimes,

3178
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:26,198
他都等不到指令
he wouldn't even wait for the line.

3179
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:28,601
就会直接冲进失火的房间里
He'd just, he'd just go in, like, a fully involved room,

3180
01:52:28,635 --> 01:52:30,437
我们都在喊他 你这是做什么
and you're, like...I'm like, "What are you doing?"

3181
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:33,840
如果他听到里面有人的话
And because if-if he heard there was somebody in there,

3182
01:52:33,873 --> 01:52:35,709
他就会马上冲进去
he'd just go in.

3183
01:52:35,742 --> 01:52:37,644
这就是他的方式
That's the way, you know...


3184
01:52:37,677 --> 01:52:38,712
他就是这样的人
He... That's who he was.

3185
01:52:38,745 --> 01:52:40,279
他本性就是这样 你知道吗
That's how he was built, you know?

3186
01:52:40,312 --> 01:52:42,582
他不可能 不做这样的事
He couldn't, he couldn't not be that way.

3187
01:52:44,617 --> 01:52:46,419
你明白吗
You understand?

3188
01:52:46,453 --> 01:52:49,789
谢谢你 真的 谢谢你告诉我
Thank you. No, thank you, thank you for sharing.

3189
01:52:49,823 --> 01:52:51,858
太棒了
That's awesome.

3190
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:53,460
他要是听到我这么说
He would slap the shit out of me

3191
01:52:53,493 --> 01:52:56,663
肯定会扇死我 但他确实是个英雄
if he heard me say this about him, but he was a hero.

3192
01:52:58,364 --> 01:53:00,600
人们需要英雄
And heroes are necessary.

3193
01:53:00,633 --> 01:53:03,436
而英雄应该拥有家庭 对吗
And they should be allowed to have families, all right?

3194
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:06,372
虽然我知道 那意味着
But I know it means, you know,

3195
01:53:06,406 --> 01:53:09,008
家人会因此受苦
that people suffer.

3196
01:53:09,042 --> 01:53:12,344
我很遗憾 真的
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

3197
01:53:12,378 --> 01:53:14,848
对不起 我说的话太混账了
Well, but I'm sorry for being a dick.

3198
01:53:14,881 --> 01:53:17,817
- 所有事都有两面性  - 不用道歉
- There's-there's two sides to every story.  - No.

3199
01:53:17,851 --> 01:53:20,887
谢谢你告诉我 谢谢你让我明白这些
Thank you for sharing with me. Thanks for taking me here.

3200
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:23,423
- 好了 我们别搞得跟奥普拉秀一样  - 是啊
- All right, we don't have to get all Oprah.  - Yeah.

3201
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,358

This-this is why I don't drink.I just, I just smoke weed.

3218
01:54:14,641 --> 01:54:16,876
 所以你未来打算怎么走啊
Hey, so what are you gonna do?


3220
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:21,080
什么怎么走
With-with what?

3221
01:54:21,114 --> 01:54:22,882
你的小日子啊
With your life.

3222
01:54:24,617 --> 01:54:26,786
你总有啥是感兴趣的吧
You must be passionate about something.

3223
01:54:28,388 --> 01:54:30,957
额 有啊 我对纹纹身有兴趣啊
Um, yeah, the...the tattoo thing.

3224
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:33,526
我超爱纹身的
I... I love that.

3225
01:54:34,828 --> 01:54:36,830
你只是嘴上说说的那种喜欢而已嘛
Were you, like, into that?

3226
01:54:36,863 --> 01:54:41,534
没有， 我其实私下经常练习的
No, you know, it-it takes a lot of practice, you know, and...

3227
01:54:42,669 --> 01:54:46,472
但现在我身边的朋友已经没法让我继续再给他们纹身了
None of my friends will let me tattoo them anymore and...

3228
01:54:46,506 --> 01:54:48,675
嘿 要不你给我纹个好了
Hey, why don't you give me a tattoo?

3229
01:54:49,709 --> 01:54:51,110
啥
What?

3230
01:54:51,144 --> 01:54:52,478
啥个头啊
What-what?

3231
01:54:52,512 --> 01:54:53,780
来嘛 我反正没有任何纹身
Come on, I don't have any tattoos.

3232
01:54:53,813 --> 01:54:56,850
我就像白纸一张 嘿嘿
I'm a, I'm a blank slate, man.


3233
01:54:56,883 --> 01:54:58,852
我后背随你怎么练手
Put it on my back. Yeah, use it for practice.

3234
01:54:58,885 --> 01:55:00,854
额 你不是喝多了
Well... well, you're just saying this

3235
01:55:00,887 --> 01:55:02,488
才这么说的吧 你不是
'cause you're drunk, right? You're not...

3236
01:55:02,522 --> 01:55:03,723
-你不是认真的吧-难道每个人第一次纹身  
- You're not actually... - Isn't everybody drunk

3237
01:55:03,756 --> 01:55:06,059
都是在喝醉的时候
when they get their first tattoo?

3238

It's my back. I don't give a fuck.

3241
01:55:10,496 --> 01:55:12,498
反正我又看不见
I'm never gonna see it.

3242
01:55:12,532 --> 01:55:15,735
还有 我跟你说
Plus, I got to tell you something, you know.

3243

我看见你给Harold画的英雄了
I saw that drawing you did for Harold.

3244
01:55:20,506 --> 01:55:23,476
我都震惊了
I was kind of blown away by it, man. You...

3245
01:55:23,509 --> 01:55:25,478
画得有点忒好了
You're getting really good at it.

3246
01:55:25,511 --> 01:55:27,647
我练过很多次的
I'm practicing a lot.

3247
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,781
是嘛
Yeah.

3248
01:55:28,815 --> 01:55:31,117
只要坚持铁杵也能磨成针
Like anything, you keep doing it, you get better at it.

3249
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:32,719
然后呢 我
And I, you know...

3250
01:55:32,752 --> 01:55:36,589
我也希望你能成功
You know, I do want to see you do well, all right?

3251
01:55:36,623 --> 01:55:39,492
我相信你
I-I believe in you.

3252
01:55:39,525 --> 01:55:41,027

你也会这么对我说的吧
Y-You-you gonna say it back?

3257
01:55:52,572 --> 01:55:54,207
我才不这么说
I'm not ready to say something like that.

3258
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,642
你得回应我呀
You got to say it back.

3259
01:55:55,675 --> 01:55:57,410
要不然我明天挂了 你怎么办
What-what if I die tomorrow?

3260
01:55:58,544 --> 01:56:00,747
那我就会说
Then I'll be that guy saying,

3261
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,916
你知道吗 虽然我没说出口 但是  
"You know, even though I never said it..."

None of that shit little girls like to color in.

3269
01:56:18,031 --> 01:56:18,998
好

Okay.

3270

I want to be able to fucking read

3274
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:25,772

哥儿们 为啥你们爱搞这玩意儿
Dude, why do you get these?

3287

我不知道啊 我
Um, I don't know. I, uh...

3288
01:56:51,798 --> 01:56:53,633
每次不痛快的时候 我都会
Whenever I'm going through something, I just,

3289
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:54,867
我都会搞一个纹身
you know, I get one.

3290
01:56:54,901 --> 01:56:56,636
让我自己放松下冷静下
It relaxes me and calms me down.

3291
01:56:56,669 --> 01:56:58,538
这有助于我思考人生
Helps me, like, think things through, you know.

3292
01:56:58,571 --> 01:57:01,040
-这可以让你放松  -是啊

你没想过比如做瑜伽啥的去放松自己么
You ever think of taking, like, a yoga class?

3294
01:57:04,143 --> 01:57:05,712
或者冥想啥的
Meditating?

3295
01:57:05,745 --> 01:57:07,847
或者献个血
Why don't you just give blood?

3296
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:09,749
那个也是用针扎的
There's still needles involved.

3297
01:57:09,782 --> 01:57:11,517
嗯这个纹身好看哦
Yeah, that's a nice tattoo.

3298

3299
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,522
-你丫混蛋在偷看我牌  -啥
- You looking at my cards, you piece of shit? - What?

3300
01:57:16,556 --> 01:57:17,690
没呢 我说的是纹身
No, no, no, no. I'm talking about the tattoo.

3301
01:57:17,724 --> 01:57:18,558
你干嘛呢

- What? - First good hand you dealt me

3303
01:57:20,193 --> 01:57:21,160
你作弊

3304
01:57:21,194 --> 01:57:22,128
-他说的是纹身好不啦  -是啊
- He was talking about the tattoo.- Exactly.

3305
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:25,131
-这么烂的借口
- You are the worst liar ever.


3306
01:57:25,164 --> 01:57:26,866
6乘以4等于多少
What's six times four?

3307
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:28,167
24
- 24.


3308
01:57:28,201 --> 01:57:30,169
24 对了 是 24 
24. Yeah, 24.

3309
01:57:30,203 --> 01:57:32,572

3312
01:57:37,143 --> 01:57:38,745
聪明的娃儿
Look how smart you are.

3313
01:57:38,778 --> 01:57:39,979
我在猜你画的都是些啥
I'm trying to guess what you're drawing

3314
01:57:40,013 --> 01:57:41,748
你手在我后背上上下下的动着
by the, by the way your hand's going.

3315
01:57:41,781 --> 01:57:43,816
记住啊 别整那些个奇怪的玩意儿啊 小心我的40米大刀
Remember, nothing weird or I'll kill you.

3316

这看起来不奇怪吧
It doesn't look weird, does it?

3318
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,054
挺正常的
No, not at all.

3319
01:57:48,087 --> 01:57:50,656

It looks wonderful.

3321
01:57:52,191 --> 01:57:54,227
哎呀 这么疼的咩
Oh! Is it supposed to hurt?

3322
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:56,095
咋这么疼呢
Is it supposed to hurt that much?

3323
01:57:56,129 --> 01:57:58,097
墨通过针扎进你皮肤 当然疼了
It's-it's a needle going into your back. Yeah.

3324
01:57:58,131 --> 01:58:01,567
道理我懂啊 我以为背上脂肪多点 会好点儿
I know, but I thought I had more back fat than that.

3325
01:58:01,601 --> 01:58:03,169

3328
01:58:05,204 --> 01:58:06,172
绝对不行
Never.

3329
01:58:06,205 --> 01:58:07,740
别打扰专业人士干活
Don't mess with perfection.


3331
01:58:10,676 --> 01:58:11,878

18 Carpenter Avenue between Rockland and Franklin.

3335
01:58:18,885 --> 01:58:21,054
2楼的一个私宅窗户有烟雾冒出
Smoke coming from the second- floor window of a private home.

3336

Listen, everything's all good.

3347
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:52,118
没什么大不了的
It's, uh, really nothing.

3348
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:53,219
我只要你帮我一下下
I just need a little assistance.

3349
01:58:53,252 --> 01:58:54,954
这个马上处理一下就好了
This is something that needs to be taken care of now.

3350
01:58:54,987 --> 01:58:56,856
你这是咋整的呀 你还好么 你被枪击中了
What happened? Are you okay? Did you get shot?

3351
01:58:56,889 --> 01:58:58,991
-还是你被捅刀子了 -这一点儿也不是小事儿啊
- Were you stabbed? - It's not really a big deal.

3352
01:58:59,025 --> 01:59:00,860
可能是我的电子烟在我裤兜里爆炸了 
My vape exploded in my pocket. Just...

3353
01:59:00,893 --> 01:59:03,363
也可能是我做瑜伽动作没做对
I didn't stretch right before yoga.

3354
01:59:03,397 --> 01:59:05,965
可能我刚在玩儿乒乓球儿不小心滑倒了 
I was playing tennis.I slipped.

3355
01:59:05,998 --> 01:59:08,234

- Well, which one is it? - What do you want me to say?

3356
01:59:08,267 --> 01:59:09,335
没啥事儿了
It was nothing.

3357
01:59:09,369 --> 01:59:12,839
我只是需要你帮我处理下伤口
I just need some medical attention, but just by you.

3358
01:59:12,872 --> 01:59:15,041
大哥 我大哥110 问下啊 我也不知道该咋整啊
Dude, I got to call 911. I don't know what to do.

3359
01:59:15,074 --> 01:59:17,243
别别别 别回头把警察给我招来了
No, no, no, listen, listen. No police, please.

3360

3361
01:59:18,412 --> 01:59:20,113
-你说啥呢你  -没事
- What does that even mean? - No.

3362
01:59:20,146 --> 01:59:22,148
我们不需要政府的人协助了
We don't need to get the government involved  into this situation.



3364
01:59:23,216 --> 01:59:24,217
我们一起弄弄就好了
We can handle this together.

3365
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,686
大佬 我现在嗨着呢 没法帮你啊

我也很嗨着呢
I'm high, too.

3367
01:59:28,721 --> 01:59:30,823
那你应该很了解我的感受啊
Well, then you know how I feel.

3368
01:59:30,857 --> 01:59:33,092
你要我怎么做
- What do you want me to do?

3369
01:59:33,126 --> 01:59:34,361
帮我看下伤口
Take a look at this.

3370
01:59:34,394 --> 01:59:35,995
我需要清洗下伤口
I need some sort of foam.

3371
01:59:36,028 --> 01:59:37,730
-我嘞个去 - 你有针可以缝下么
- Holy shit! - You got some stitching?

3372
01:59:37,763 --> 01:59:39,132

- Dude! - Do-do you have, like, a little needle?

3373
01:59:39,165 --> 01:59:41,067
-你有没有类似针一样的东西 -没有
- Do you have something with a needlepoint? - No.

3374
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:42,101
这是咋回事啊
What happened?

3375
01:59:42,135 --> 01:59:44,003
就是一场误会 发生点儿争执
It was a misunderstanding. It was an argument.

3376
01:59:44,036 --> 01:59:46,139
不过我们和好了 我们解决了
But we're all friends again. We worked it out.

3377
01:59:46,172 --> 01:59:47,206
你懂的 都是朋友嘛
You know how buddies get.

3378
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,242
老大我得把你送医院去
Dude, I... We-we, we got to take you to the hospital

3379

02:04:57,349 --> 02:05:00,019
因为他也经常绊跤
with you 'cause he was tripping all the time"?

3521
02:05:00,052 --> 02:05:01,721
是啊

嗯我懂

3525
02:05:07,461 --> 02:05:13,065
得知他跟其他人一样也有自己的毛病
Knowing that he had his issues and... problems

3526
02:05:13,098 --> 02:05:16,202
我松了一口气
just like everybody else, it makes me feel better.

3527
02:05:16,235 --> 02:05:19,972
他是个真正活生生的人了
It really... it really humanizes him.

3528

他是个很好的人

他也是个很复杂的人

他有着一颗大爱的心

I know we don't really talk about it much, but...

3543
02:06:05,652 --> 02:06:08,120
我
...I, uh...

3544
02:06:08,153 --> 02:06:10,055
我很想念老爸
I-I miss Dad.

02:06:34,246 --> 02:06:38,217
我为我之前的叛逆
I'm sorry that I've been

3551
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:41,388
的行为道歉
so difficult to deal with.

Iam so sorry.

3556
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:53,198

我的意思是
I mean, come on.

3562
02:07:12,385 --> 02:07:14,320
当我和他一起出门的时候
- When we go out in public,

3563
02:07:14,354 --> 02:07:15,722
人可能会以为我被他绑架了呢
people think that I'm kidnapped, you know?

3564
02:07:15,755 --> 02:07:18,190
就我俩出现在超市的那身打扮
The looks that we get at the supermarket.

3565
02:07:18,223 --> 02:07:19,726
人们看着我就像在问
They're like... People-people look at me like,

3566
02:07:19,759 --> 02:07:22,127

relationship stuff and serious bullshit, but I can't.

I can help you, if you like.

3596
02:08:36,469 --> 02:08:38,270
你才不会想帮我呢
You don't want to help me.

3597
02:08:38,303 --> 02:08:40,607

3602
02:08:51,351 --> 02:08:53,920
Amy必须要在一天内完成3个任务
"Amy must complete three tasks at work.

3603
02:08:53,953 --> 02:08:55,989
她预计前两个任务
"She estimates that the first two tasks

3604
02:08:56,022 --> 02:08:58,558
她需要45分钟完成
"will take her 45 minutes to complete

3605
02:08:58,591 --> 02:09:00,393
第三个任务需要花她
"and that the third task will take her

3606
02:09:00,427 --> 02:09:01,928
2小时45分钟完成
"two hours and ten minutes to complete.

3607
02:09:01,961 --> 02:09:03,930
如果Amy 的估计是准确的话
"If Amy's estimate is correct,

3608
02:09:03,963 --> 02:09:07,232
她完成所有任务的总耗时是多少
how long will it take her to complete all three tasks?"

3609
02:09:08,034 --> 02:09:10,670
3小时又40分钟
Three hours and 40 minutes.

3610
02:09:10,704 --> 02:09:13,707
你猜的还是你已经知道答案了

3613
02:09:17,342 --> 02:09:19,012
-哇 - 还好啦
- Wow.- It's not that amazing.

3614
02:09:19,045 --> 02:09:20,312
-没有 就是很厉害呢 -别紧张
- It is, no. - Relax.

3615
02:09:20,345 --> 02:09:21,548
都是数学题啊
I-I... Is it all math questions?

3616
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:23,248
应该是了 公务员考试不都这样
I thought it was, like, city shit.

3617
02:09:23,282 --> 02:09:24,184
没有没有 
No, no.

3618
02:09:24,216 --> 02:09:25,985
你得证明你很聪明
You have to prove that you're not stupid,

3619
02:09:26,019 --> 02:09:27,821
这样他们才会让你在城市里工作
and then you can work for the city.

3620
02:09:27,854 --> 02:09:28,988
哦哦
Oh. Oh.

3621
02:09:29,022 --> 02:09:31,357
看来我是没法在城市里工作了
So I can never work for the city.

3622
02:09:34,894 --> 02:09:36,696
嘿 我
Hey, uh, I...

3623
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:38,965

3624
02:09:38,998 --> 02:09:40,734

我一直都很爱你 我
I-I always have, and I, um...

3628
02:09:46,706 --> 02:09:49,409
所以我才表现得很奇怪
That's why I always act so weird.

3629
02:09:49,442 --> 02:09:53,312
我不知道我要如何表达自己
'Cause I don't know how to express myself.

3630
02:09:53,345 --> 02:09:55,014
因为我的错误表达
Failure to do so

3631
02:09:55,048 --> 02:09:57,016
所以给你带来了很大的伤害
could result in serious injury.

3632
02:09:57,050 --> 02:09:59,619
我要问下一题吗  -好
- Should I ask the next? - Yeah.

3633

3634
02:10:02,455 --> 02:10:05,592
在一家医疗机构工作 16% 是文员
"working at a medical facility, 16% are clerks.

3635
02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:06,793
多少个是
How many are..."

3636

I've lost my place.

3639
02:10:25,478 --> 02:10:29,649
一家医疗机构有250名员工 
"Of the 250 people working at a medical facility,

3640
02:10:29,682 --> 02:10:31,518-16% 是文员  --嗯
- 16% are clerks."
- Mm-hmm.

3641
02:10:31,551 --> 02:10:33,520
非文员类的职员有几个
"How many are not clerks?"

3642
02:10:33,553 --> 02:10:35,088
答案页都被你泄露了
You're showing me the page.

3645
02:10:49,803 --> 02:10:51,938

3647
02:10:54,474 --> 02:10:57,342

3656
02:11:12,458 --> 02:11:14,427
拓展下你的视野啥的
Like, broaden your horizons.
